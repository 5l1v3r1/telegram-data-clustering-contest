When the Chiefs win with a high-school coach at QB, we know they are for real
04 Nov 2019, 10:00 by Hunter Felt

Kansas City have done pretty well without Patrick Mahomes at the helm. The rest of the league should worry when he returns

When the Kansas City Chiefs approached Matt Moore about taking over as their back-up quarterback from the injured Chad Henne in August, he was working as an assistant coach at California’s Hart High School. Now, Moore, who did not play a single snap in the NFL in 2018, may have led Kansas City to their biggest win of the season. The Chiefs’ gritty 26-23 win over Kirk Cousins and the Minnesota Vikings not only improved their record to 6-3, good enough to keep them in first place in the AFC West, it showed that this is a genuine team and not just Patrick Mahomes’s supporting cast.
Nobody, other than delusional professional contrarian Skip Bayless, would argue that the Chiefs would be better off in the long run with Moore rather than Mahomes. Mahomes is a generational talent, who could potentially be the face of the entire league. The sooner he comes back from his dislocated knee, the better it will be for the team’s chances at winning, both in the short-term and in the long-term.
With that obvious caveat, the Chiefs having to come together to win this game without Mahomes could end up paying dividends later in the season. When Mahomes is fully healthy and playing at his best, he is about as close as it comes to football having a cheat code and there can be a temptation to simply run the offense through him and let him rack up ridiculous numbers. In the regular season, in a quarterback-driven league, that’s usually going to result in a win. The postseason, however, can be a different beast, as the Chiefs learned back in January.
Sunday’s offensive star was wide receiver Tyreek Hill, who showed why the Chiefs have stuck with him despite the disturbing child abuse allegations leveled against him. Hill picked up 140 receiving yards, averaging 23.3 yards per carry and was the recipient of Moore’s lone touchdown pass. He even managed to steal the spotlight from his own teammate when he caught up to running back Damien Williams during his 91-yard touchdown run. The late game heroics came courtesy of kicker Harrison Butker who hit a 54-yard field goal to tie the game and then won it all on a 44-yarder.



And then there was Kansas City’s much derided defense. Their clear achilles’ heel last season, the Chiefs’ defense took on a Vikings team fully capable of piling on points when given the opportunity. Minnesota’s Dalvin Cook came into Sunday’s game leading the league in rushing, while the Chiefs were ranked just 30th against the run. It looked like a clear mismatch on paper but Cook ended up with just 71 rushing yards on the day. It could just be a blip, of course, but it could be the sign of a defense stepping up on a day when everybody knew they couldn’t afford to get into a shootout.



Maybe, more than anything else, Sunday’s win over the Vikings will end up being a confidence boost. The Chiefs came into this game having lost three out of their last four games and they were (and remain) still unsure of when the reigning NFL MVP would be returning to the lineup. They came away with a win against a very dangerous opponent. If they can do this with a former assistant high school coach as their quarterback, think of what they could accomplish when Mahomes fully heals.
Stat of the week
9. That’s the total yardage accumulated by the Chicago Bears at halftime of their game against the Philadelphia Eagles, including just a single yard passing. While this kind of performance indicates a team-wide failure, it’s not unfair to single out quarterback Mitch Trubisky as having the biggest slice of the blame pie. While Trubisky elevated his game in the second half, it was mostly because there wasn’t another direction his game could go. Running back David Montgomery’s two rushing touchdowns accounted for the entirety of the Bears offense in a 22-14 loss. The Bears are now 2-5 on the season and dead last in the NFC North.
MVP of the week



Russell Wilson, QB, Seattle Seahawks. This is not exactly a bold pick as Wilson could very well end up being the MVP of the entire season. In a 40-34 overtime win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Wilson added five more touchdowns to his gaudy season total and, as usual, failed to throw an interception. Most importantly, he helped improve his team’s record to 7-2, which would be a lot sweeter for them if it weren’t for the fact that the team above them in the NFC West standings, the 49ers, hadn’t decided to stop losing altogether.
Quote of the week



“It’s the NFL. You can’t be embarrassed by this shit” – New York Jets head coach Adam Gase after being asked if his team’s embarrassing 1-7 record was, in fact, embarrassing.
On Sunday, the Miami Dolphins’ tanking strategy finally ran into a problem it couldn’t solve: Adam Gase and the New York Jets. The Dolphins spent their entire offseason unloading every single potentially useful player in what was meant to be a radical rebuild. Part of this “process” involved deliberately putting together a noncompetitive roster in order to ensure they would have the top overall pick in next year’s draft. It turns out that these Dolphins may not be the NFL’s worst team. In fact, they may not even be the worst team in the AFC East.
On Sunday, Dolphins QB Ryan Fitzpatrick threw for three touchdowns and the Dolphins managed to get their first win of the season by beating a beyond-dysfunctional Jets team 26-18. So, the Jets, a team that had postseason aspirations in the first few weeks of the season ended up losing to a team that was constructed to lose. You can and should be embarrassed by this if you’re on the Jets. (And, for the record, Gase is lying about not using this term, but that’s neither here nor there.)



Now that the Dolphins and Jets have identical 1-7 records, the 0-8 Cincinnati Bengals, who didn’t even play this week, have pulled in front of the Tanking Standings. The Bengals now have the best chances at landing the overall No1 pick, but things could change if they accidentally win next week (although the Baltimore Ravens are unlikely to let that happen).
Video of the week



Houston Texans QB DeShaun Watson pulled off this Houdini act against the Jacksonville Jaguars defense in what ended up being a 26-3 victory in London. It was, as the score indicates, a rough time for his counterpart Gardner Minshew, who ended up throwing for two interceptions and taking three sacks. It’s looking like Nick Foles might have his job back when he returns from his clavicle injury. We’ll always have the Uncle Rico memes.
Elsewhere around the league
-- The Patriots were unbeaten coming into Sunday night’s game against the Ravens, but some questioned whether they had come up against a team that had truly tested them. Well, Baltimore did just that and were worthy winners as they beat the Patriots – and pummeled their vaunted defense – 37-20. The 8-0 49ers are now the only team with a perfect record this season.
-- Could this be the end of the line for Hall of Famer Adam Vinatieri? Despite a knee injury to starting quarterback Jacoby Brissett, the Indianapolis Colts put themselves in position to beat the Pittsburgh Steelers. Down 26-24 in the game’s closing minutes, they were a 43-yard field goal away from pulling ahead. Shockingly, Vinatieri’s kick missed everything and the Steelers managed to escape with a win. The Colts fell to 5-3 and – worse yet – it wasn’t the first time that they could pin a loss on the man once known as “Automatic Adam” during his time with the New England Patriots. The NFL is a merciless league and even placekickers eventually show their age, The 46-year-old Vinatieri’s career could be over sooner rather than later.



-- So much for all the hype about the Cleveland Browns, whose season essentially ended with a 24-19 loss to the Denver Broncos. It was not a fun game for those of us who were convinced they would be the feel-good story of the NFL season, as quarterback Baker Mayfield led his team on a series of promising drives that inevitably fizzled out into field goal attempts. In one painful scene, Cleveland’s defenders indifferently bounced off Denver tight end Noah Fant as he ran 75 yards into the end zone. Mayfield’s fourth-quarter touchdown pass to Jarvis Landry gave the team brief hope, but their late comeback attempt fell short thanks partly to some questionable coaching decisions from probably doomed head coach Freddie Kitchens. With the loss, Cleveland’s record fell to 2-6 while the Broncos’ improved to 3-6.
-- What if they had a game between Aaron Rodgers and Philip Rivers that featured only a single passing touchdown, and it was thrown by the losing quarterback? Rodgers’s pass to Jamaal Williams ended up being the only end zone reception of the game in a 26-11 Los Angeles Chargers win over the Green Bay Packers, who have fallen to 7-2 after the upset.
