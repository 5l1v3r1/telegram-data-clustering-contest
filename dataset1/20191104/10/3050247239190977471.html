      <h1>Blockchain and AI Have ‘Revolutionized’ War — India Defence Minister</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T10:49:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 10:49</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/india">India’s</a> Defence Minister believes <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain">blockchain</a> technology, artificial intelligence (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ai">AI</a>) and big data will form part of the future of warfare.</p>
      <p>As local daily news outlet <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/armed-forces-must-be-equipped-to-meet-challenges-of-modern-warfare-rajnath-singh/articleshow/71889592.cms">Times of India</a> reported on Nov. 4, Rajnath Singh highlighted the potential of blockchain, along with big data and AI, in defense operations. </p>
      <h3>Warfare’s new “blockchain paradigm”</h3>
      <p>Speaking to a range of delegates from 80 countries in Delhi, Singh appeared under no illusion about India’s plans to access innovation as the global industry evolves. He explained:</p>
      <blockquote>“The role of AI, big data and blockchain technologies has already revolutionized the existing paradigm of warfighting. The defence industry is undergoing a churning to cope and employ these technologies, in order to safeguard the safety and security of critical infrastructure.”</blockquote>
      <p>India will hold its annual defense conference, DefExpo 2020, in February.</p>
      <h3>India goes in for blockchain-not-Bitcoin</h3>
      <p>India has joined the list of countries taking a markedly different stance on blockchain compared to the phenomena it underpins, specifically <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrencies</a> such as Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>). </p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph reported, a ban on providing liquidity to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrency-exchange">exchanges</a> has metamorphosed into a legal process that could see cryptocurrency <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/supreme-court-of-india-postpones-cryptocurrency-ban-hearing-to-november">outlawed altogether</a>. </p>
      <p>The existing ban has already caused problems, with the police themselves <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-police-cant-move-seized-crypto-due-to-indias-anti-crypto-law">unable</a> to move crypto funds seized as part of law enforcement.</p>
      <p>At the same time, blockchain continues to make its way into various facets of the economy. Last week, one Indian state <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/10th-largest-indian-state-to-release-policy-for-blockchain-and-ai">confirmed</a> it was working on dedicated policy updates for both blockchain and AI.</p>
