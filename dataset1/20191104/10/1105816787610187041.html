      <p>Now, we all know Deepika Padukone enjoys a massive social media following – over 40 million fans and followers, to be exact. And of late, her Instagram has been abuzz, more so than ever before.</p>
      <p>Tagging her latest upload as ‘post-Diwali celebrations,’ the Mrs Ranveer Singh shared a few baby postcards, leaving everyone wondering if that was her in the pictures. But a few users took the guessing game to a different level and started speculating that Padukone may actually be pregnant herself.</p>
