They could democratize capital markets and incentivise more people to learn how real-time events affect the value of their investments and the future performance of the global economy. That should help to solve long-term problems of environment, human rights, trade barriers, poverty, and education. Let’s make people global stakeholders in a sustainable future.”</blockquote>
