      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 4): MMAG Holdings Bhd is planning to dispose of a piece of freehold vacant industrial land in Klang for RM13 million in cash to Acter Carton Enterprise Sdn Bhd.</p>
      <p>The proposed disposal is via a sale and purchase agreement (SPA) entered between its unit Active Trio Deluxe Sdn Bhd (ATDSB) and Acter Carton Enterprise.</p>
      <p>The land, measuring about 18,381 sq m or 197,853.08 sq ft, has a net book value of RM13.04 million based on audited financial statements of ATDSB for the financial year ended March 31, 2019 (FY19), MMAG said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia today.</p>
      <p>The original cost of the land stood at RM12.67 million, which was bought on June 18 last year.</p>
      <p>The proceeds from the proposed disposal will be utilised for the purchase of two freehold parcels with buildings located at Kawasan Perusahaan Valdor, Pulau Pinang, the company said.</p>
      <p>The proposed disposal is not expected to have any material effect on the companyâ€™s consolidated Net Assets (NA), NA per share and gearing, as well as consolidated earnings for the financial year ending March 31, 2020 (FY20), MMAG added.</p>
      <p>Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the board expects the proposed disposal to be completed by the start of next year.</p>
      <p>Just last month, MMAG had announced it is buying a piece of land together with buildings in Penang from Dynaciate Group Bhd, formerly known as Tatt Giap Group Bhd, for RM41 million to expand its logistics business.</p>
      <p>Shares of MMAG closed unchanged at 36 sen today, bringing its market capitalisation to RM257.46 million.</p>
      <p>Year-to-date, the counter grew some 56.5% from 23 sen. Prior to Sept 25 this year, the counter was below 30 sen, over the last four-and-a-half years.</p>
