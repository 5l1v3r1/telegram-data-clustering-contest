      <p>LONDON: British MPs began the selection of their new speaker on Monday (Nov 4) to replace John Bercow, who enraged the government but won a global following with his parliamentary rulings on Brexit.</p>
      <p>Seven MPs have put themselves forward to replace Bercow, whose shouts of "Order! Order!" have rung out across the House of Commons since June 2009.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Lindsay Hoyle, Bercow's deputy since 2010, is the odds-on favourite to fill his shoes - and won the first round of Monday's voting by a wide margin - but other political heavyweights are also still vying for the job.</p>
      <p>After Prime Minister Boris Johnson opened the process on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II, each candidate gave a short pitch before a series of secret ballots began.</p>
      <p>Two were eliminated in the first round but voting will continue until a winner secures more than half of votes, and can take their seat in the speaker's raised green chair.</p>
      <p>But he or she will not have too long to get comfortable as parliament will be dissolved late Tuesday for the Dec 12 election, after which they will return.</p>
      <p>The winning candidate is expected to give up party affiliation and traditionally does not contest general elections.</p>
      <p>
        <b>KEY BREXIT PLAYER</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chosing a new speaker has been an unremarkable event in the past, but Bercow became a key player in the chaotic process of Britain's exit from the European Union.</p>
      <p>With the Commons divided over how, when and even if Brexit should happen, he oversaw more than three years of crucial debates that defined the course of Brexit.</p>
      <p>His supporters say he has empowered ordinary MPs by granting time for emergency debates and amendments, which had the effect of pressuring or even tying ministers' hands.</p>
      <p>But critics accused him of subverting centuries of parliamentary tradition with the aim of frustrating Brexit.</p>
      <p>Bercow, who was a Conservative MP before he took on the politically neutral role of speaker, has also been accused of failing to tackle a culture of bullying.</p>
      <p>Last week, Johnson paid guarded tribute, likening Bercow's glare to a "trademark Tony Montana scowl", after Al Pacino's character in the 1983 film "Scarface".</p>
      <p>Opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn praised his modernising reforms, which included increasing staff diversity, boosting public access to parliament and switching from traditional robes to suits.</p>
      <p>But it was his colourful personality and eccentric performances in parliament that gave him an international profile.</p>
      <p>A social media mash-up by German television of footage of Bercow calming rowdy MPs has been seen more than a million times. A Belgian newspaper called him "irreplaceable".</p>
      <p>If Johnson succeeds in his goal of winning a majority in the December election - as opinion polls suggest - the next speaker's job could be fairly straightforward as chair of debates.</p>
      <p>But if he fails and there is another minority government, the new arrival will have to arbitrate between yet another group of divided MPs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DEPUTIES JOSTLE FOR PROMOTION</b>
      </p>
      <p>The clear winner in the first round was Hoyle, with 211 out of 562 ballots cast.</p>
      <p>He has been a Labour MP for 22 years and was Bercow's deputy from 2010, since when his distinctive Lancashire accent has rung out from the speaker's chair.</p>
      <p>The 62-year-old is as unimpressed as his predecessor by the shouting and braying from MPs, once chastising Scottish Nationalists for humming the EU anthem "Ode to Joy" in the chamber.</p>
      <p>Hoyle pledged in an interview published in the Sunday Times - in which he introduced his parrot "Boris" - to repair what he claims has become a "toxic parliament".</p>
      <p>"I don't want the abuse of each other and I think we have got to close that down quickly and make sure it is a calmer place to be," he said.</p>
      <p>Bercow's number two deputy, Eleanor Laing, was in second place with 113 votes.</p>
      <p>The 61-year-old Conservative entered parliament in 1997 and previously served as the party's spokeswoman on Scotland.</p>
      <p>They were followed by former Church of England vicar and now Labour MP Chris Bryant, Labour MP Harriet Harman, parliament's longest-serving female MP, and another deputy speaker, Labour's Rosie Winterton.</p>
