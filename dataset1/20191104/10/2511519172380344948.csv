Chelsea transfer ban: CAS set date for Blues’ appeal ahead of January window
The Blues have already served half the ban – yet were still able to welcome in Christian Pulisic and complete a permanent move for Mateo Kovacic 
04 Nov 2019, 10:43 by Jack Rathborn
Chelsea’s appeal against their transfer ban will be heard at  the Court of Arbitration for Sport on November 20.
CAS will rule on FIFA’s punishment with the Blues said to have broken rules to sign youth players from abroad.
CAS intend to conclude matters before the January transfer window opens, thus allowing Frank Lampard to potentially bolster his squad.
Chelsea already served half of its one-year ban on registering new players during the offseason trading period.
The club did not seek to freeze the FIFA sanction while preparing the appeal to CAS.
FIFA’s disciplinary and appeal committees have said Chelsea violated 150 rules protecting minors from trafficking. Those cases involved about 70 players.
Chelsea was also judged to break rules prohibiting third-party influence on players. FIFA imposed a fine of 600,000 Swiss francs ($608,000).
The club has denied wrongdoing.
