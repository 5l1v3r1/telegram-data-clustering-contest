Dame Julie Andrews has joked that fictional nanny Mary Poppins would have been able to sort out Donald Trump. 
The actor mentioned the US president during a talk at London’s Southbank Centre, where she was asked whether she believed Trump would have turned out different had he had the beloved Disney character for a nanny. 
“Oh, Mary Poppins would have shaped him up,” Andrews responded. “God knows, if only we had the chance to try.”
Andrews has previously criticised Trump for making huge funding cuts to the arts, which she described as “mind-boggling”.
She also said she was “deeply disturbed” by Trump pulling America out of the Paris Climate Agreement. 
She starred as Mary Poppins in the classic 1964 film alongside Dick Van Dyke, David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns.
Her recent roles include a voice part in the DC blockbuster Aquaman.
