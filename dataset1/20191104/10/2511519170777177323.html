      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-review-cast-france-period-lesbian-drama-london-film-festival-a9148271.html"><i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i></a> star Adèle Haenel has accused her former collaborator Christophe Ruggia of sexually harassing her from the age of 12, allegations which the director has denied.</p>
      <p>The French actor claims the sexual harassment began after she was cast in Ruggia’s 2002 film<i> The Devils</i>.</p>
      <p>In a report published by Paris-based investigative publication <a href="https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/031119/metoo-dans-le-cinema-l-actrice-adele-haenel-brise-un-nouveau-tabou?onglet=full"><i>Mediapart</i></a>, Haenel alleges that the harassment by Ruggia, who is 24 years her senior, took place when she was between the age of 12 and 15.</p>
      <p>The actor, who said she decided to speak out about the alleged harassment after being inspired by the Michael Jackson documentary <i>Leaving Neverland</i>, has chosen not to pursue legal action against Ruggia as she believes “justice ignores” victims of sexual harassment.</p>
      <p>In response to the <i>Mediapart</i> report, Ruggia sent a statement via his lawyers saying that he “categorically refutes” any misconduct, adding that the pair had a “professional and affectionate relationship”.</p>
      <p>Haenel describes Ruggia’s conduct during the filming and release of her film debut <i>The Devils</i> as “permanent sexual harassment” that included “touching [on the] thighs and torso” and “forced kisses on the neck.”</p>
      <p>She alleges that the harassment took place at the director’s apartment and while travelling to film festivals.</p>
      <p>The six-month <i>Mediapart</i> investigation included interviews with more than 30 people connected to Haenel and Ruggia, including <i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire </i>producer Bertrand Faivre.</p>
      <p>Faivre, who produced Ruggia’s 2011 drama<i> In Turmoil</i>, has stated that he will no longer work with the director.</p>
      <p><i>Mediapart</i> also states it obtained love letters sent to Haenel by Ruggia.</p>
      <p><i>The Independent </i>has contacted Ruggia's representatives for comment.</p>
      <p>Haenel is a six-time César Award nominee and a two-time winner, for <i>Love At First Fight </i>in 2015 and <i>Suzanne</i> in 2014.</p>
