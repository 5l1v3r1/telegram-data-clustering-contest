「M17」旗下交友平台爆收費大小眼　執行總監澄清：因需求有落差
04 Nov 2019, 10:58 by 娛樂組
「M17」集團旗下同志交友服務平台「HEDER」日前遭人投訴，收取入會會員費用有大小眼之嫌，今日「HEDER」執行總監陳柏宏回覆本刊坦言的確在收取服務費上有落差，主因是每個會員需求條件不同而產生不同的服務費用，因此才會讓會員有所誤解。
本刊近日接獲民眾投訴，男星黃立成創立的「M17」集團旗下同志交友平台「HEDER」，以低價拉攏條件良好的單身猛男，吸引其他同志朋友付下高額費用，期待能配對成功，但實際上這些人卻是為了充門面而已，讓你看得到卻吃不著。
針對此事，「HEDER」執行總監陳柏宏回覆本刊表示「HEDER是依照各個會員的條件需求及課程內容，提供客製化專屬方案」，並不諱言價格的確會有落差。
對於有會員對於服務費用的落差產生誤解，「HEDER」的公關顏小姐坦言這部分可能與服務人員當下沒跟該會員解釋清楚，產生誤會，「對於會員對我們的高度期待，服務未臻完美之處，未來也將持續優化」。「HEDER」表示會員在實際約會前是無法看見對方照片，也就是說，無法從外表得知對方條件以吸引消費者上門指定配對。最後，「HEDER」強調雖然藝人「Jeff」黃立成是17直播的創辦人，目前也僅是「M17」集團非執行董事，本身與Paktor集團旗下服務並沒有任何投資或營運關係。

""M17""'s dating platform has a large fee for the fee. Executive Director clarified: due to the gap in demand

""Heder"" service platform ""HEDER"" of the ""M17"" Group has been complained recently. The fee for membership fees is very small. Today, ""HEDER"" Executive Director Chen Baihong replied that there is a gap in the collection of service fees. The main reason is that Each member has different requirements and different service fees, so the members will be misunderstood.
Recently, the magazine received complaints from the public. The ""M17"" group of the ""M17"" group, created by the male star Huang Licheng, has drawn a good single man at a low price, attracting other comrades and friends to pay high fees, and expects to be successful. But in fact, these people are just to fill the facade, so that you can see but can not eat.
In response to this matter, ""HEDER"" Executive Director Chen Baihong replied that ""HEDER is providing a customized and customized solution according to the conditions and requirements of each member"", and it is not a false statement that prices will indeed fall.
In the case of a member who misunderstood the gap in service fees, the public relations officer of ""HEDER"" admitted that this part may not be explained clearly with the member of the service staff at the moment, and misunderstanding occurred. ""For members' high expectations, the service is not perfect. At the same time, the future will continue to be optimized."" ""HEDER"" means that members cannot see each other's photos before the actual date, that is, they cannot know the other party's conditions from the outside to attract consumers to specify the pairing. Finally, ""HEDER"" emphasizes that although the artist ""Jeff"" Huang Licheng is the founder of the 17 live broadcast, he is currently only a non-executive director of the ""M17"" group. He does not have any investment or operational relationship with the services of the Paktor Group.
