回應國台辦對台26條，外交部長「簡體字」發文：我們台灣用不到一國兩制
04 Nov 2019, 10:37 by 李修慧


我們想讓你知道的是中國國台辦今天發布惠台26條措施，內容包括台灣人可以在中國駐外使領館申請旅行證件，但有導遊指出，中國給台灣人的「旅行證件」的服務早就已經在施行。



中國國務院台灣事務辦公室（國台辦）與國家發改委今（4）日推出對台「26條措施」，標榜「提供與中國民眾同等待遇」，內容包括台灣人可以在中國使館申請旅行證件、擴大招收台灣學生等。總統府、行政院、外交部發言人都出面指責這是中國「一國兩制」的手段，而外交部長吳釗燮甚至在推特用「簡體字」發文表示：「我們台灣用不到一國兩制，真的不用客氣，給你們人民多點自由也不錯喔」。
總統府批評26條措施：名為惠台，實為鎖台
（中央社）中國國台辦與國家發改委今天聯名推出「關於進一步促進兩岸經濟文化交流合作的若干措施」，內含26條，其中針對台灣企業、台灣民眾各13條，標榜「提供與中國民眾同等待遇」。


【全文】國台辦再提對台26條「與中國民眾同等待遇」，陸委會批夾帶「一國兩制」


總統府發言人丁允恭表示，兩岸應正向交流、對等互惠，而不應名為惠台，實為鎖台。此「26條措施」，實際上是「一國兩制台灣方案」的行動方案，中國意圖以此框架台灣，也損害台灣人民實質利益。
丁允恭指出，可以發現，不管是31項也好、26項也罷，從過去的實證檢驗，其所宣稱的效益有限，並未為台灣人民帶來真正實益，只是成為分化台灣社會、擾亂台灣人心、干預台灣民主選舉進行的政治手段。
丁允恭說，細究其措施內容，更可以發現其所謂惠台的矛盾不實。如一手號稱提供外館協助，一手卻打壓台灣外交發展；又或是一邊宣稱歡迎運動員赴中參賽，另一邊卻在更重要的國際賽事打壓台灣。稱此為惠台，益顯其虛假與諷刺。
丁允恭表示，正告中國政府，應停止對台灣的打壓、放棄「一國兩制台灣方案」的政治前提，如此方為兩岸發展正道，真正促進和平穩定，也對兩岸人民有真實助益。
行政院發言人Kolas Yotaka（谷辣斯．尤達卡）表示，去年中國開出「對台31項措施」效果不彰，現在又推出「26條措施」擾論台灣人民視聽，都是想溫水煮青蛙，逼迫台灣接受「一國兩制」方案的手段。台灣是主權獨立國家，不是中國的一部分，呼籲中國政府放下政治圖謀，真心與台灣合作，為兩國人民的公平、互惠交流而努力，才能創造雙贏。
外交部長用「簡體字」發文回嗆，「給你們人民多點自由」
外交部發言人歐江安表示，中國國台辦4日公布的「對台26條措施」，其中第14條明載「台灣同胞可在中華人民共和國駐外使領館尋求領事保護與協助，申請旅行證件」，對此外交部嚴正聲明，中華民國台灣是主權國家，政府對國民行使領事權與中國無涉，不需要也不會委託中國政府代為行使。
歐江安說，中國政府所提措施，只不過是在推銷「一國兩制台灣方案」，意在最終併吞台灣，政府已經多次清楚說明，拒絕一國兩制就是台灣共識，中國政府假意惠台，不會得逞。
而外交部長吳釗燮下午也在外交部推特特別用「簡體字」署名發文說，中國國台辦推出對台26條，去年也有31條，看起來好多條，「但我們台灣用不到一國兩制，真的不用客氣，給你們人民多點自由也不錯喔」。



國民黨：2020重新執政，會儘快恢復兩岸兩會制度化
《中央社》報導，國民黨下午發布新聞稿表示，只要是有助於提升人民福祉、企業權益，且不影響國家安全的兩岸政策，相信社會各界都會表達歡迎。
國民黨指出，樂見26項措施涵蓋台灣企業與人民同等參與的服務及便利措施，但若其中有任何矮化中華民國主權的作法，則一定堅決反對。希望兩岸雙方彼此都以民生為重，不要因一時的選舉考量，傷害兩岸人民的權利與利益。
國民黨表示，若國民黨在2020重新執政，必定儘快恢復兩岸兩會制度化的協商機制，維護台海和平穩定，保障兩岸人民及企業的福祉和權益。
《中央社》報導，國民黨立法院黨團總召曾銘宗也說，這次的對台26條，中國提供很多優惠，想要拉走台灣的人才與企業，也希望透過這種方式讓台灣漸漸邊緣化；盼政府對企業「五缺」趕快拿出具體解決措施，把企業留在台灣發展，至於拉人才部分，政府也要拿出具體措施，包括如何改善低薪環境等。曾銘宗強調，假如民進黨忙於選舉，只會操作「芒果乾（亡國感）」，不拿出具體因應措施，到時候台灣被邊緣化，蔡政府必須負最大的責任。
導遊：中國早就推出給台灣人的「旅行證件」
《中央社》報導，不過，有國內導遊表示，針對其中的14條，中國外交部及國台辦已在一些公開及私下場合聲稱，台灣民眾若在海外需要急難救助，都可就近向中國駐當地國家的使領館請求救助。
中國外館或邊防單位先前就已向台灣人提供「旅行證件」的服務，並非新舉。而台灣人會尋求中國的旅行證件多半出自2種情況，一是想前往簽證取得不易的國家，二是護照遺失。
這名導遊指出，像是申請簽證較為費時的中亞、高加索、俄羅斯等前蘇聯國家，有些人會先前往中國或中東國家旅遊一下，再向邊防或當地中國外館申請臨時護照等證件入境，通常會比在台灣申請快速許多。
他表示，也有國人是在海外一些台灣未設立駐外機構的國家或城市遺失護照，若無人從旁協助，也有先向當地中國外館申請旅行證件，以便順利離境的案例。
學者：去年對台31條效果不彰
去年2月28日，國台辦宣布實施《關於促進兩岸經濟文化交流合作的若干措施》，共31條惠台措施，吸引台灣企業、社團、藝文業等領域人才，前往中國發展。陸委會當時就表示，這是「以利益換取台灣的政治認同。」行政院則批評31條措施，「名為惠台，實則利中」，並提出39項措施因應。


中國公布31項惠台措施—國台辦發言人：前所未見；陸委會：以利益換政治認同


中國「31項措施」吸走台灣人才、企業，行政院提「39項措施」因應


《中央社》報導，台灣智庫諮詢委員董立文指出，中共今年下半年的對台政策，基本上都會針對台灣總統大選來作為。
董立文表示，中共去年年初提出「對台31項措施」，一年多過去，雖然全中國約90個城市都已提出相應的政策，卻效果不彰，因此，現在才需要再提出「26條措施」。他指出，「26條措施」的總體目標仍是藉著給台灣民眾國民待遇，來塑造利於兩岸統一的氛圍。
而他也表示，「26條措施」中特別提出讓台灣企業參與5G等重大技術的研發、建設，再次顯示出鎖定台灣高科技人才與技術，這點值得注意。至於其他的措施，他認為可能仍像之前一樣，「看得到，吃不到」。

Responding to the 26th of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Taiwan Affairs Office, the Foreign Minister’s ""Simplified Chinese Characters"" issued: We do not use one country, two systems in Taiwan.
04 Nov 2019, 10:37 by Li Xiuhui


What we want you to know is that China’s Taiwan Affairs Office today issued 26 measures for Huitai, including Taiwanese who can apply for travel documents at Chinese embassies and consulates abroad, but some tour guides pointed out that China’s “travel documents” for Taiwanese The service has already been implemented.



The State Council Taiwan Affairs Office (Taiwan Affairs Office) and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) today (4) launched Taiwan's ""26 measures"", flaunting ""providing the same treatment as the Chinese people"", including Taiwanese who can apply for travel documents at the Chinese Embassy and expand Recruit Taiwan students and so on. The presidential palace, the Executive Yuan, and the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs all accused this of being a means of China's ""one country, two systems"". Foreign Minister Wu Hao even said in a ""simplified Chinese character"" on Twitter that ""we don't use one country, two systems in Taiwan, and we really don't have to be polite. It’s not bad to give your people more freedom.”
The presidential palace criticized 26 measures: named Huitai, which is actually a lock
(Central News Agency) The China Taiwan Affairs Office and the National Development and Reform Commission jointly launched the ""Several Measures to Further Promote Cross-Strait Economic and Cultural Exchanges and Cooperation"", including 26 articles, including 13 articles for Taiwanese companies and Taiwanese people, advertised as ""providing the same as the Chinese people."" treatment"".


[Full Text] The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council has introduced 26 ""the same treatment as the Chinese people"". The MAC has approved the ""one country, two systems"" policy.


The presidential palace spokesman Ding Yungong said that the two sides should exchange exchanges and reciprocity, and should not be called Huitai. This ""26 measures"" is actually an action plan for the ""One Country, Two Systems Taiwan Plan"". China intends to use this as a framework for Taiwan and to undermine the real interests of the Taiwan people.
Ding Yungong pointed out that it can be found that whether it is 31 or 26, from the empirical test of the past, its declared benefits are limited, and it has not brought real benefits to the Taiwanese people. It has only become a differentiation of Taiwanese society and disrupted the hearts of Taiwanese people. Intervene in the political means of democratic elections in Taiwan.
Ding Yungong said that if the contents of the measures are carefully studied, the contradiction of the so-called Huitai can be found. For example, it is said that it provides assistance to foreign libraries, but it suppresses Taiwan's diplomatic development. It also claims to welcome athletes to participate in the competition, while the other side is suppressing Taiwan in more important international events. Calling this Huitai, it shows its falsehood and irony.
Ding Yungong said that the Chinese government should stop telling the suppression of Taiwan and abandon the political premise of the ""one country, two systems Taiwan program"". This will lead to the development of the right path for the two sides of the strait, truly promote peace and stability, and also have real benefits for the people on both sides of the strait.
Executive Council spokesperson Kolas Yotaka said that last year China’s ""31 measures against Taiwan"" did not work well. Now it has introduced ""26 measures"" to disturb the people of Taiwan. Boiled frogs, forcing Taiwan to accept the ""one country, two systems"" program. Taiwan is a sovereign independent country, not part of China. It calls on the Chinese government to lay down its political plot and sincerely cooperate with Taiwan to work for the fair and mutually beneficial exchanges between the two peoples in order to create a win-win situation.
The Foreign Minister used the ""simplified Chinese characters"" to post a reply, ""Give your people more freedom.""
Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Ou Jiangan said that the ""Taiwanese Measures for Taiwan"" announced by the Taiwan Affairs Office of the People's Republic of China on the 4th, including Article 14 ""Taiwan compatriots can seek consular protection and assistance at the embassies and consulates of the People's Republic of China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs solemnly declares that the Republic of China on Taiwan is a sovereign state. The government has no right to exercise consular power over the country and does not need to entrust the Chinese government to act on its behalf.
Ou Jiangan said that the measures proposed by the Chinese government are only selling the ""one country, two systems Taiwan plan"", which is intended to eventually swallow Taiwan. The government has clearly stated that the rejection of one country, two systems is the Taiwan consensus, and the Chinese government will not succeed in deliberately benefiting Taiwan.
In the afternoon, Foreign Minister Wu Hao also wrote a special ""Simplified Chinese Character"" in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying that the Taiwan Affairs Office of the People’s Republic of China has introduced 26 articles against Taiwan. Last year, there were also 31 articles. It seems that there are many articles. ""But we do not use one country, two systems in Taiwan. You are welcome, it is not bad to give your people more freedom.""



The Kuomintang: Re-ruling in 2020 will resume the institutionalization of the two sides of the strait
The Central News Agency reported that the Kuomintang issued a press release in the afternoon saying that as long as it is a cross-strait policy that helps to improve people's well-being and corporate rights and does not affect national security, I believe that all sectors of society will welcome it.
The Kuomintang pointed out that it is willing to see 26 measures covering the services and facilities for the equal participation of Taiwanese enterprises and people. However, if there is any practice that dwarfs the sovereignty of the Republic of China, it must be resolutely opposed. I hope that both sides of the strait will focus on the people's livelihood and not hurt the rights and interests of the people on both sides of the strait because of the temporary election considerations.
The Kuomintang said that if the Kuomintang regains power in 2020, it will certainly resume the institutionalized consultation mechanism between the two sides of the strait, safeguard the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait, and safeguard the well-being and rights of the people and enterprises on both sides of the strait.
""Central News Agency"" reported that Zeng Mingzong, the general assembly of the Kuomintang Legislative Yuan Party Committee, also said that this year's 26 Taiwan, China offers many concessions, wants to take away Taiwan's talents and enterprises, and hopes to gradually marginalize Taiwan in this way; For the ""five shortages"" of enterprises, we will quickly come up with specific solutions to keep the enterprises in Taiwan. As for the talents, the government must also come up with specific measures, including how to improve the low-paying environment. Zeng Mingzong stressed that if the DPP is busy with elections, it will only operate ""mango (death in the country)"" and will not come up with specific measures. When Taiwan is marginalized, the Cai government must bear the greatest responsibility.
Tour Guide: China has long introduced ""travel documents"" for Taiwanese
""Central News Agency"" reported that, however, a domestic tour guide said that for 14 of them, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council have stated in some public and private occasions that Taiwanese people can be close to China if they need emergency assistance overseas. The embassy or consulate of the country requested assistance.
Chinese foreign libraries or border defense units have previously provided ""travel documents"" services to Taiwanese, not new. The majority of Taiwanese travellers seeking travel documents from China are from two situations. One is to go to a country where visas are difficult to obtain, and the other is to lose passports.
The tour guide pointed out that some countries in the former Soviet Union, such as Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Russia, which are more time-consuming to apply for visas, will first travel to China or the Middle East countries, and then apply for temporary passports and other documents to the border defense or local Chinese foreign libraries. It is usually much faster than applying in Taiwan.
He said that some people in the country have lost passports in some countries or cities where Taiwan has no foreign institutions. If no one is assisting, there are also cases of applying for travel documents to the local Chinese foreign libraries in order to successfully leave the country.
Scholar: Last year's 31 results against Taiwan
On February 28 last year, the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office announced the implementation of the ""Several Measures on Promoting Cross-Strait Economic and Cultural Exchanges and Cooperation"". A total of 31 measures to benefit Taiwan, attracting talents from Taiwanese enterprises, associations, arts and literature, and other fields to China. The MAC said at the time that this was ""in exchange for the political identity of Taiwan."" The Executive Yuan criticized 31 measures, ""named Huitai, but in fact benefited"" and proposed 39 measures.


China Announces 31 Measures for Huitai - Spokesperson of the Taiwan Affairs Office: Never seen before; MAC: Exchange of interests for political identity


China’s “31 measures” sucked away Taiwan’s talents and enterprises, and the Executive Yuan’s “39 measures”


""Central News Agency"" reported that Taiwan’s think tank advisory committee Dong Liwen pointed out that the CCP’s Taiwan policy in the second half of this year will basically be targeted at the presidential election in Taiwan.
Dong Liwen said that the CCP proposed ""31 measures against Taiwan"" at the beginning of last year. More than a year has passed. Although about 90 cities across China have put forward corresponding policies, the effect is not good. Therefore, it is now necessary to propose ""26 measures."" ""."" He pointed out that the overall goal of the ""26 measures"" is still to create an atmosphere conducive to the reunification of the two sides of the strait by giving national treatment to the Taiwan people.
He also said that the ""26 measures"" specifically proposed to allow Taiwanese companies to participate in the R&D and construction of major technologies such as 5G, and once again show that it is worthy of locking in Taiwan's high-tech talents and technologies. As for other measures, he thinks that it may still be the same as before, ""see and can't eat.""
