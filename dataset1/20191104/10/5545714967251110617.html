      <h1>Bandai Namco is celebrating Pac-Man's 40th anniversary with an attempted banger of a theme song</h1>
      <h2>I didn't expect any of this (is...is that a Devo reference?)</h2>

      <p><i>Pac-Man</i> was released back in 1980, which makes May 2020 the 40th anniversary.</p>
      <p>It's incredible just how far this little yellow puck has come, eating his way through gaming history to become arguably the most iconic character in the gaming-sphere to date (along with Mario, but Pac-Man's parent company says that it has "90% recognition around the world"). Bandai Namco knows that the Pac is still in demand, which is why they've remade, remastered and re-released all sorts of <i>Pac-Man</i> packages these past four decades, on top of things like cartoon deals, merchandise and a whole lot more. </p>
      <p>To ring in the 40th next year the publisher is opting for a celebration of sorts, which will happen throughout the entire next year and kicks off with this theme song: "Join The Pac" by Ken Ishii,  a song smartly devoid of lyrics to ensure that no one embarrasses themselves. There's no game news or anything in the clip, just as a warning: it's literally a music video.</p>
      <p>Bandi Namco will update <a href="https://www.pacman.com/en/">the official Pac-Man website</a> with more news as it comes, and we'll relay the important, non-t-shirt partnership stuff to you when it does.</p>
