      <p>Iran marked the 40th anniversary of the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran with a state organised rally on Monday.</p>
      <p>Thousands of school pupils and university students took part in the rally outside the former U.S. embassy. Similar demonstrations were organised around the country.</p>
      <p>In November 1979, students seized the embassy in protest at the decision to allow the toppled Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, into the United States for medical treatment.</p>
      <p>The hostage-taking at the U.S mission, which took place soon after the Iranian Revolution in 1979, set the tone for decades of mistrust and poor ties between Washington and Tehran.</p>
      <p>The shah was installed in a coup in 1953 partly orchestrated by British secret services and the CIA in the United States.</p>
      <p>The U.S broke off diplomatic relations with Iran over the embassy takeover. They have not been reinstated.</p>
      <p>The atmosphere between Iran and the U.S has been tense since U.S President, Donald Trump dealt a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran a major blow by pulling the U.S out of the deal in 2018 and engaging in the current U.S policy of maximum pressure on Tehran.</p>
