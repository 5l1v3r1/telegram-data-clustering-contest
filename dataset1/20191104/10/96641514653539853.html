      <p>If you've ever been chatting on WhatsApp about a Netflix trailer and had to leave the app in order to watch it, WhatsApp has a new feature you'll appreciate. You can now watch Netflix trailers directly in WhatsApp. It's a simple change, but it could be useful for people who watch a lot of Netflix and plan watches with their friends and family.</p>
      <p>For now the Netflix feature is only available on the latest iOS version of the app. WhatsApp has not officially announced the new feature -- it was spotted by a <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-to-start-streaming-trailer-videos-from-netflix/"><i>WABetaInfo</i></a> follower -- and we don't know when it might arrive on Android. This only pertains to trailers. If you want to stream a full show or movie, you'll still need to head to the Netflix app.</p>
      <p>Last year, a WhatsApp update made it possible to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/05/07/facebook-instagram-videos-play-in-whatsapp/">watch Instagram and Facebook videos</a> in the app. So it's not entirely surprising that WhatsApp is adding more video content.</p>
