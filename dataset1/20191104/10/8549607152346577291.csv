On Tuesday the ETH/USD pair added 4.3 percent to its value and climbed up to $190, successfully defending the $180 support. The next target for bulls was to surpass and hold $190 in order to confirm the mid-term uptrend.
On Wednesday however, the ether formed a similar red candle on the daily chart completely erasing its gains from the previous session. It closed at $183 while touching the $180 mark during intraday.

It opened the new trading period by moving up to $0.305 during intraday, successfully breaking the above-mentioned support zone. Bears, however, were fast to react and pushed the price back down to $0.294, erasing the recent gains.
On Tuesday, October 29, the XRP/USD pair climbed up to $0.302 after touching $0.31 earlier in the day.
The exact same candle but in the opposite direction was formed on the mid-week session on October 30 as the XRP fell down to $0.294. Bulls and bears were struggling to hold to their gains and were not able to consolidate properly in order to establish a definitive trend.
We saw the coin trading in the $0.298 – $0.291 zone on Thursday, October 31. It formed another red candle on the daily chart and closed the month at $0.294 or 14.3 percent higher compared to the previous 30-day period.
The last day of the workweek and first day of November came with a third consecutive losing session for XRP. It dropped to $0.291 after touching $0.285 during intraday.
The latest move by the coin suggested we could be seeing a return of bears at least in the short-term.
The weekend of November 2-3 started with a small increase to $0.294, while on Sunday, November 3 we witnessed yet another push by bears, this time to $0.29. The XRP lost 2 percent of its value during the week.



Altcoin of the Week
Our Altcoin of the week is Ontology (ONT). The decentralized business network environment was 35 percent up for the last seven days and 52 percent for the two week period.
Ontology is a China-based project created in 2017 by Erik Zhang and Da HongFei, also founders of the NEO blockchain. The ONT coins were never distributed during Initial Coin Offering (ICO) but were airdropped to NEO holders instead.
The ONT coin peaked at $1,10 on October 28 and now stands at #23 on the CoinGecko Top 100 list with a total market capitalization of approximately $603 million.
The most probable reason for the recent surge is the pro-blockchain rhetoric by Chinese authorities and the reemerged interest in the technology from the Asian country.
The project leaders also released their monthly update on October 31 outlining the recent technical progress and the most important development.
As of the time of writing, the ONT is trading at 0.0000971 against BTC on the Binance daily chart.
