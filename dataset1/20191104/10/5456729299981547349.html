      <p>Everton midfielder Andre Gomes will have surgery on Monday after suffering a fracture-dislocation to his right ankle in their Premier League match against Tottenham Hotspur, his club have said.</p>
      <p>The Portugal international sustained the injury in the 1-1 draw at Goodison Park on Sunday after landing off balance at speed following a tackle from Spurs forward Son Heung-min.</p>
      <p>Everton released a statement confirming Gomes would need surgery but did not set out a timeline for his return.</p>
      <p>Manager Marco Silva has backed the 26-year-old to make a full recovery.</p>
      <p>“We will give all support to Andre and his family,” Silva told reporters. “As a group we have to stay together.”</p>
      <p>“He is seriously injured but I am 100 per cent sure Andre will become stronger as a football player and as a man because he is a fantastic lad, a fantastic professional.”</p>
      <p>Son was shown a red card for his part in the incident and was in tears in the dressing room afterwards.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the 27-year-old was called up to the South Korea squad for two matches later this month and national team coach Paulo Bento said his international team mates would rally around him.</p>

      <p>“What happened in that match is really unfortunate,” Bento told Yonhap News Agency. “It doesn’t matter which country a player is from. You never want to see anyone get hurt that seriously, but it’s also part of the game.</p>
      <p>“Heung-min has to pick things up and move forward, and we’ll try to help him the best we can.”</p>
      <p>South Korea play Lebanon in a World Cup qualifier on November 14 before facing Brazil in a friendly five days later in Abu Dhabi.</p>
