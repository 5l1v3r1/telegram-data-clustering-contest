砂州向铝制品征新销售税 引发对齐力赚幅的担忧
04 Nov 2019, 10:11 by Khairie Hisyam Aliman



（吉隆坡4日讯）砂拉越州政府提议向铝制品征收州销售税（SST），可能会压缩齐力工业（Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd）的赚幅，因该公司正努力应对获利面临的压力。
根据《The Edge》看到的演讲稿，砂首席部长拿督巴丁宜阿邦佐哈里今日在州议会指出，将从2020年1月1日起，征收铝制品的新税，税率为1%。
这引发对齐力盈利赚幅的担忧。该东盟最大铝冶炼商在砂州设有工厂。
砂州政府预计，在2020年从铝制品中征收5800万令吉的SST，作为提高州收入努力的一部分。
新税引发市场对齐力未来获利的担忧。齐力大部分产品是出口，不知道是否会有任何例外。
铝制品SST的推出，正值齐力为展延已久的砂州第三座铝冶炼厂制定融资计划。
今年7月31日，该公司与砂拉越能源（Sarawak Energy Bhd）签署新的购电协议，后者将提供高达500兆瓦的电力，为期15年。
截至去年12月31日止2018财政年，上游率炼业务是齐力的核心业务，占经审核营业额的90.6%，以及营运盈利的97%。
根据年报，齐力在2018财年取得91亿7000万令吉的营业额，按年增长12.2%，税前盈利年增7.6%至8亿7050万令吉。经审核的营运盈利报11亿1000万令吉。
上游铝炼业务贡献了83亿1000万令吉的营业额和10亿8000万令吉的营运盈利。齐力位于Samalaju和沐胶的两座冶炼厂，年产能合共为76万吨（见表）。
2019财年首半年，齐力营业额跌5.7%至43亿令吉，同期报46亿令吉；净利由3亿1110万令吉，跌29.9%至2亿1800万令吉。
闭市时，该股起8仙或1.69%，以4.80令吉挂收，市值达193亿9200万令吉。

Sarawak levies new sales tax on aluminum products
04 Nov 2019, 10:11 by Khairie Hisyam Aliman



KUALA LUMPUR (April 4): The Sarawak state government's proposed state sales tax (SST) on aluminum products may compress the profit of Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd as the company is struggling to cope with the pressures of profitability.
According to the speech that The Edge saw, Sand Chief Minister Datuk Badinyi Abang Zohari pointed out today in the state legislature that from January 1, 2020, a new tax on aluminum products will be levied at a rate of 1%. .
This raises concerns about the profitability of alignment. The ASEAN largest aluminum smelter has a factory in Sarawak.
The Sarawak government expects to impose a RM58 million SST from aluminum products in 2020 as part of an effort to increase state revenue.
The new tax raises concerns about market alignment and future profitability. Most of Qili's products are exported, and I don't know if there will be any exceptions.
The launch of the aluminum product SST is at the same time as the long-established financing plan for the third aluminum smelter in Sarawak.
On July 31 this year, the company signed a new power purchase agreement with Sarawak Energy Bhd, which will provide up to 500 megawatts of electricity for 15 years.
As of December 31, last year, the upstream refining business was the core business of Qili, accounting for 90.6% of the audited turnover and 97% of operating profit.
According to the annual report, Qi Li achieved a turnover of RM9.1 billion in FY18, up 12.2% year-on-year, and pre-tax profit increased by 7.6% year-on-year to RM770.5 million. The audited operating profit was reported at RM1.11 billion.
The upstream aluminum refining business contributed a turnover of RM8.31 billion and an operating profit of RM1.08 billion. Qili is located in two smelters in Samalaju and Mujiao with an annual production capacity of 760,000 tons (see table).
In the first half of FY19, Qili's turnover fell 5.7% to RM4.3 billion, which was RM4.6 billion in the same period. Net profit decreased by 29.9% to RM218 million from RM31.11 million.
At the close of the market, the stock rose 8 sen or 1.69% to RM 4.80, with a market capitalization of RM 193.92 million.
