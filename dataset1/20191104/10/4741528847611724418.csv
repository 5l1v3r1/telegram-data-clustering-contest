04 Nov 2019, 10:00 by Research Team
Listed companies on the Nigerian Stock Exchange posted a combined profit after tax of about N4.2 trillion between 2015 and 2018. The companies also reported tax expenses of about N804.7 billion during the 4-year period. Total revenues during this period were also N36.8 trillion. Nigeria’s President Buhari has been in office since 2015 and presided over the economy during this period.
The data looks at results released over the last 4 quarters for publicly listed companies on the Nigerian Stock Exchange for the combined years 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. Some of the increase in revenues recorded over the period was also a result of new listing and not necessarily due to organic growth. This is the breakdown;

What this means: Over the last 4 years, Nigeria has suffered a drastic recession that reduced growth to an average of 2% per annum. The inflation rate has remained doggedly at double digits, while interest rates remain very high. Government revenues have also fallen significantly during the period and are now accompanied by rising debts and debt service to revenue ratio. Despite strong economic head and tailwinds, it appears that Nigerian companies have continued to perform against all odds and grow their topline revenues.
Important to note that the Nigerian Stock Exchange market capitalization of N13 trillion is about 10% of GDP and does not account for non-listed companies as well as the informal sector. However, it is an important barometer for how the economy has faired over the first 4 years of the Buhari Administration. Because the data is based on revenues from listed companies an important metric to gauge performance will be the profit margin. The data shows profit margin has risen from 10% in 2015 to 15% in 2018. This means companies have kept a higher percentage of their revenues as profits.

The Future of Nigerian Stock Exchange
At a revenue of N10.8 trillion, Nigerian stocks revenue to GDP is about 8%, one of the lowest in the world. Stocks also have a market cap of about N13 trillion, just 20% more than its revenue (1.2x).
