從合樸市集到樹合苑，科技新貴的農食教育與地方創生之路
04 Nov 2019, 10:00 by 讀者投書


我們想讓你知道的是一個年輕人如果想要靠農食創業移居地方，大概需要有三年的準備期。這三年期間請你不要辭掉工作。斜槓，是年輕人回鄉創生地方，可以採行的方式。

脫去科技業光環，選擇下鄉從農，進而創辦合樸農學市集的陳孟凱，藉由市集連結起消費者與農業的關係。
一對年輕男女朋友，因為愛上豆花的美味，興起想要開豆花店的心願。雙雙辭掉台北工作後，來到台中樹合苑豆腐工作坊上課後，加入樹合苑的「農食職人」創業培訓，專注於黃豆加工的實習一年，結業後經樹合苑創辦人陳孟凱媒合引介到農食業界工作，作中學累積更多經營經驗後，雙方父母從原來的擔心到支持，決定協助二人踏上創業之路；也有離鄉背井的年輕人，同樣是上過豆腐工作坊的實作課程及實習後，成功學到一技之長，回到離島故鄉開起豆腐坊。
甚至有位財務自由、但覺得原來從事的行業很乏味，想要開創退休後第二人生的科技業主管，因為熱愛黃豆加工，夢想以社區豆腐坊創業，也來到豆腐班學習。陳孟凱發現他有很強的機電工程專業能力，鼓勵他善用原來專長於農食領域，安排他到建置中央廚房的企業實習，結果他的專業能力與農食產業結合得很好，獲得老闆賞識，特別讓他繼續留任，如今他已成功轉換跑道，以企業內創業的模式來發展第二人生，準備在食農領域大展長才。
由電機博士陳孟凱在台中開辦的樹合苑豆腐、釀造、咖啡……等手作班，透過實習及師傅指導的「學徒制」，陸續成功協助20餘人轉職農食相關領域開創事業。陳孟凱本人更是移居地方、回鄉創業的地方創生先行者。

從合樸市集到樹合苑，陳孟凱的農食教育與創業之路
陳孟凱曾是科技新貴，卻投身推動農業飲食教育及創業，並在2018年獲農委會頒發優秀農業人員之殊榮。跳tone的人生經歷，常令人覺得難以置信。
就一般社會標準來看，陳孟凱可說是人生勝利組。求學過程相當順利，自建中、台大電機系畢業，再留學美國取得電機博士及企管碩士學位，在美國居住15年後回台創辦科技公司，擁有自己的事業。後來因為親長生病，加上創業的壓力導致健康出現警訊，於是決定在45歲的壯年之際返回家鄉台中，並從科技業轉向投入農業。
2003年他創辦東籬農園，2007年與三位夥伴在東籬農園開辦每月一次的合樸農學市集，推動社區支持友善生態農業。「合樸」（Hope）有「合作、簡樸」之意，也是英文「希望」的諧音，並推出「好好務農、好好讀書、好好吃飯及好好生活」四大課程。歷經10多年的耕耘，合樸儼然成為中部很知名的農夫市集，也匯集了許多農友、消費者和志工，近年更進駐台中的百貨公司。
2013年，因緣際會下，陳孟凱再將台中一座釣蝦場改建為「樹合苑」，不只巧妙地透過植栽、陽光、通風及流水等元素，將舊場房改造成綠建築，2014年正式營運後，在此開辦對環境友善的豆腐、釀造等手作班，各式廚房及生活小鋪等，並結合許多志同道合的人共同參與，讓參與者不只在此消費，還一起學習、實習及分享生活，成了友善農食的重要聚落。在地方創生的風潮下，陳孟凱近年來更帶領樹合苑投入城鄉創生，培育「農食職人」。

從1.0到4.0，農食創業急不得
一路從科技業轉向農業，理論與實務兼具的陳孟凱，歸納出一套自創的農食創業，從1.0到4.0的歷程，每一階段會有部分重疊，卻是透過累積逐步推進，無法一蹴可幾。

關連程度　　　　　　　　　弱　強



他指出，若從地方創生所重視的「關係人口」（以關心及關聯程度來定義關係）來看，2007到2009年是「合樸1.0」階段，此時期來市集的主要是消費者，吸引都市裡有點關心友善食農的消費者，藉由在市集直接跟農夫買產生些許與鄉村的關聯。「合樸1.0」階段，除了每月市集以外，合樸常態舉辦相關農食手作課程及每月帶消費者至產地參訪，透過常態與農友互動交流，有些消費者慢慢變成愛好者甚至鐵粉。愛好者不只自己參與合樸活動，還會帶親朋好友一起來，但此時的愛好者多半還停留在只出錢、未出力。
2010年起，是陳孟凱認為的「合樸2.0」階段。此時已有不少愛好者或鐵粉轉型為志願者或推廣者，已經不只是出錢、也願出力協助合樸相關活動，合樸再透過培訓計畫，推出回饋志工的以務易務或以務易物（以服務或勞務互相交換務或物）活動，透過參與者不只出錢購買產品，更是出力擔任義工，此時關係程度就從1.0時代進展一大步。
2013年開始培養樹合苑營運人才，招募不少從合樸時代累積而來的志願者，開始培養一年後樹合苑需要的全職員工，這是陳孟凱眼中的「２.5」階段，因為這時志願者或推廣者大多都還在各自職場工作，但因為喜愛與認同友善農食的理念，而以斜槓方式成為食農學徒，透過學習農食加工創造產值，參與運營並累積經驗，慢慢開展農食生涯，2014年樹合苑成立，進入「合樸3.0」階段，樹合苑工作人員逐漸成熟，2017年樹合苑成立創生學院，培育農食人才，實踐「4.0」階段的以農食職人身分創生地方。
十年磨一劍，領導管理大不易
陳孟凱用超過十年的時間，經歷了他所謂的「1.0到4.0」的進程，目前並積極推動以農食職訓教育的內涵、斜槓及精實創業的漸進落實方式，培育出一批有潛力為地方帶來改變的生力軍。
他強調，這一切都是慢慢積累而成，急不得；尤其從合樸到樹合苑，都是以非營利組織的方式推動，這和經營企業非常不一樣。
也曾為經營者的陳孟凱進一步說明，非營利組織不是拿錢出來就可以，需鼓勵所有志願參與者，拿出他們「惠而不費」的資源，像是專業能力、人脈、時間及勞力等，為組織帶來貢獻惠益，對出此資源的人卻是不太費力或費心，例如有人很會找店面，有專業也有人脈，可以其經驗協助組織中有此需求的其他人；樹合苑則設有「社群貨幣」（Community Currency）機制，讓提供協助者得以勞務或服務兌換等值其他服務，或交換農產（豆腐、味噌、咖啡……）等物。
陳孟凱也說，非營利組織在組織領導方面，如果採用集權式「強而有力」的領導風格不易凝聚人心，而是採群策群力的可操作民主方式，導入議事規則，訂出「元規則」（訂定規則的規則），讓大家遵守並作為決策的依據，而不是由誰來獨斷決行。陳孟凱並善用自身專業開設「賽局理論」課程，鼓勵大家以合作取代競爭，此課程甚至叫座到吸引不少企業慕名邀請他去開課，或想找他為企業提供管理諮詢服務，只是成為管理諮詢顧問不是陳孟凱的使命，除非必要，否則會選擇把主要精力花在推廣友善農食。
以斜槓、精實及「SMART P」開辦地方創生學苑
深知創業及經營管理一點都不浪漫的陳孟凱觀察說：「一個年輕人如果想要靠農食創業移居地方，大概需要有三年的準備期。這三年期間請你不要辭掉工作。斜槓，是年輕人回鄉創生地方，可以採行的方式。」
從合樸到樹合苑時代，陳孟凱雖然曾協助及陪伴一些人農食創業，當時並非刻意，都是個案辦理；但也因為從1.0到3.5的個案累積經驗，讓他發現了的確存在此需求及市場。因此，樹合苑正透過斜槓及精實方式，設計陪伴的過程，幫助想要移居地方的人，累積創業能力再移往地方開創事業，進入4.0的階段。
陳孟凱指出，斜槓（slash）是從國外引進的觀念，有點像多元兼職或「半X半農」的生活，鼓勵人不必立刻放棄原本的工作或專業就可發展不同職業；精實創業（lean startup）是指透過逐步累積或實驗驗證學習，而非一下子就去開店或創業。為此，樹合苑成立創生學苑，推動「SMART P」的體制化育成平台，協助斜槓者取得創業必須具備的基本能力。
陳孟凱說，SMART分別代表Sales（業務）、Management（管理）、Ambassador（農友大使的社群合作學）、opeRation 或 entRepreneur（實作、創業運營）、Technical（手作技術），是農食職人創業需擁有的能力，而最後的P代表Practical training（師徒制），可說是樹合苑的獨具利基，可引介學員到農食職場，由師傅帶領實習。

有鑑於「一個產業如果沒有人才，就沒有機會」，以及為推廣「斜槓精實創業，育成友善農食職人」，陳孟凱也與中衛中心合作開課，希望讓更多人知道友善環境農業飲食的重要，並支持友善環境食材，也讓對想投身友善農食產業的人才具備足夠能力，才可能在地方創生之路走得可長可久。
從動手實作到實戰銷售，樹合苑為有心走入地方的創業者，以斜槓精實方式逐步實現夢想，降低創業風險。

From Hepu Market to Shuheyuan, the new technology of agricultural food education and local creation
04 Nov 2019, 10:00 by readers


What we want you to know is that if a young person wants to move to a place with a farmer's business, it will take about three years to prepare. Please do not quit your job during these three years. The slash is a way for young people to return to their hometown to create a place where they can be adopted.



Interview author: Qiu Shuang Research Editor: Zhongwei Center Local Creative Working Group Cai Mengxin
Taking off the aura of the technology industry, choosing Chen Mengkai, who went to the countryside to farm, and then founded the Hepu Agricultural Market, to link the relationship between consumers and agriculture through the market.
A pair of young male and female friends, because they fell in love with the delicious taste of beancurd, raised their wish to open a bean flower shop. After resigning from Taipei, they came to Taichung Shuheyuan Tofu Workshop to join the “Growing Food Workers” entrepreneurship training at Shuheyuan, focusing on the internship of soybean processing for one year. After the completion of the project, Chen Mengkai, founder of Shuheyuan After the media introduction was introduced to the farming industry, after the secondary school accumulated more business experience, the parents decided to help the two to embark on the road of entrepreneurship from the original fears and support. There were also young people who had left their homes and also went to the tofu workshop. After the practical course and internship, he successfully learned a skill and returned to the hometown of the island to open the tofu workshop.
There is even a financial freedom, but I feel that the industry I was engaged in is very boring. I want to create a technology owner who is responsible for the second life after retirement. Because I love the processing of soybeans, I dream of starting a business in the community tofu workshop and also come to the tofu class. Chen Mengkai found that he has a strong mechanical and electrical engineering professional ability, and encouraged him to make good use of his original expertise in the field of farming, and arranged him to practice in the establishment of the central kitchen. As a result, his professional ability and the farming industry were well combined. Appreciation, especially let him stay in office, now he has successfully converted the runway, develop the second life with the entrepreneurial model within the enterprise, ready to show great talents in the field of food and agriculture.
The “Apprenticeship”, which was run by Taichung and Dr. Chen Mengkai in Taichung, was successfully assisted by more than 20 people in the fields related to farming and food. Chen Mengkai himself is a pioneer in creating a place where he moved to the local area and returned to his hometown to start a business.

From Hepu Market to Shuheyuan, Chen Mengkai's Road to Farming Education and Entrepreneurship
Chen Mengkai was a newcomer to science and technology, but he was involved in promoting agricultural food education and entrepreneurship. In 2018, he was awarded the honor of outstanding agricultural personnel by the Council of Agriculture. The life experience of jumping to tone is often unbelievable.
Judging from the general social standards, Chen Mengkai can be said to be a victory group in life. The process of studying is quite smooth. I graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering of China University of Science and Technology. After studying in the United States, I obtained a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and a Master of Business Administration. After living in the United States for 15 years, I returned to Taiwan to start a technology company and have my own business. Later, because of the illness of my parents and the pressure of entrepreneurship, she was alerted to health. So she decided to return to her hometown of Taichung on the occasion of her 45-year-old prime, and turned from science and technology to agriculture.
In 2003, he founded the Dongfong Farm. In 2007, he and his three partners set up a monthly Heping Agronomy Market in Dongli Farm to promote community support for friendly ecological agriculture. ""Hope"" has the meaning of ""cooperation and simplicity"" and is also the homonym of English ""hope"". It also introduces four major courses, ""Good farming, good study, good eating and good life"". After more than 10 years of hard work, Hepu has become a well-known farmer's market in the central region. It has also brought together many farmers, consumers and volunteers. In recent years, it has been stationed in Taichung's department stores.
In 2013, due to the marginal meeting, Chen Mengkai rebuilt a fishing shrimp farm in Taichung into a “tree garden”. Not only did it subtly transform the old field into a green building through planting, sunlight, ventilation and running water, it officially opened in 2014. After that, we started a hand-made class of environmentally friendly tofu, brewing, and other kitchens and living shops, and joined many like-minded people to let participants not only spend here, but also study, internship and sharing. Life has become an important gathering of friendly farming. In the wave of local creation, Chen Mengkai has led Shuheyuan to invest in urban and rural areas in recent years to cultivate ""agricultural food workers.""

From 1.0 to 4.0, agricultural food business is urgent
All the way from science and technology to agriculture, both theory and practice, Chen Mengkai, summed up a set of homemade farming entrepreneurship, from 1.0 to 4.0, each stage will have partial overlap, but it is gradually promoted through accumulation, can not see Can be a few.

Relatively weak



He pointed out that from the perspective of the ""relationship population"" (the relationship between care and degree of association) that was valued by local creation, 2007-2009 is the ""Ping 1.0"" stage, and the market is mainly consumers. It attracts consumers who are a little concerned about friendly farmers in the city. By directly buying with the farmers in the market, they have a little connection with the village. In the ""Hepu 1.0"" stage, in addition to the monthly market, the company will hold relevant agricultural handicraft courses and bring consumers to visit the country every month. Through normal interaction with farmers, some consumers will gradually become hobbies. Even iron powder. Fans not only participate in the activities of the ordinary, but also bring friends and family together, but most of the fans at this time still stay in the money, not contributing.
Since 2010, it is the ""Ping 2.0"" stage that Chen Mengkai thinks. At this time, many fans or iron powders have been transformed into volunteers or promoters. It is not only for money, but also for helping to promote related activities. Hepu will introduce the benefits of volunteers through training programs. In the event of the transaction or the exchange of goods (services or services exchange services), through the participants not only pay for the purchase of products, but also contribute to volunteers, the degree of relationship has made a big step from the 1.0 era.
In 2013, we began to cultivate the management talents of Shuheyuan, recruited a lot of volunteers from the time of the Hepu era, and began to train full-time employees needed by Shuheyuan one year later. This is the ""2.5"" stage in the eyes of Chen Mengkai. At this time, most of the volunteers or promoters still work in their respective workplaces, but because they love and recognize the concept of friendly farming, they become apprentices in the slash way, create value by learning farming, participate in operations and accumulate experience, slow. Slowly carrying out the farming career, in 2014, Shuheyuan was established and entered the “Hepu 3.0” stage. The staff of Shuheyuan gradually matured. In 2017, Shuheyuan established the Creative College to cultivate farmers' talents and practice the “4.0” stage. Create a place as a farmer.
Ten years of grinding a sword, leadership management is not easy
Chen Mengkai has experienced his so-called ""1.0 to 4.0"" process for more than ten years. At present, he actively promotes the connotation, slashing and gradual implementation of the agricultural food vocational education, and cultivates a batch of The potential to bring change to the local force.
He stressed that all of this is slowly accumulating, and it is urgent; especially from Hepu to Shuheyuan, it is promoted by non-profit organizations, which is very different from operating companies.
Chen Mengkai, who also worked for the operator, further explained that non-profit organizations can do not take money out. They need to encourage all volunteer participants to come up with resources that they can benefit from, such as professional ability, connections, time and labor. To bring benefits to the organization, but the people who come out of this resource are not too laborious or bothered. For example, some people will find a storefront, have professional and personal contacts, and can assist others in the organization with this need; The Court has a ""Community Currency"" mechanism that allows the facilitator to exchange services or services for other services, or exchange agricultural products (tofu, miso, coffee, etc.).
Chen Mengkai also said that non-profit organizations in the organization of leadership, if the use of centralized ""strong and powerful"" leadership style is not easy to unite people, but the use of a group of actionable democratic methods, the introduction of rules of procedure, set the ""meta rules"" Rules of rules), let everyone abide by and act as the basis for decision-making, rather than who decides to act arbitrarily. Chen Mengkai also used his professionalism to open a ""game theory"" course to encourage everyone to replace competition with cooperation. This course even attracted many companies to invite him to start classes, or to find him to provide management consulting services for enterprises, but to become management. The consultant is not Chen Mengkai's mission. Unless necessary, he will choose to focus on promoting friendly farming.
Start a local creative school with slashes, precision and ""SMART P""
Chen Mengkai, who knows that entrepreneurship and management are not romantic at all, observes: ""If a young person wants to move to a place with a farmer's business, it takes about three years to prepare. Please don't quit your job during the three years. Slash It is a way for young people to return to their hometown to create a place where they can be adopted.""
From the time of Hepu to Shuheyuan, although Chen Mengkai assisted and accompanied some people in farming and entrepreneurship, it was not deliberate at the time, it was a case-by-case procedure; but because of the accumulated experience from 1.0 to 3.5 cases, he discovered that there is indeed such a demand. And the market. Therefore, Shuheyuan is designing the process of companionship through slashes and exquisite ways to help those who want to move to the place, accumulate entrepreneurial ability and then move to the place to start a career and enter the stage of 4.0.
Chen Mengkai pointed out that slash is a concept introduced from abroad. It is a bit like a part-time job or a ""semi-X-semi-farm"" life. It encourages people to develop different occupations without having to give up their original work or profession immediately; Lean startup) refers to learning through gradual accumulation or experimentation, rather than starting a shop or starting a business. To this end, Shuheyuan established the Creative School, promoting the institutionalized breeding platform of “SMART P” and assisting the slashers in acquiring the basic abilities necessary for entrepreneurship.
Chen Mengkai said that SMART represents Sales (business), management (management), Ambassador (community cooperation of farmers' ambassadors), opeRation or entRepreneur (implementation, entrepreneurial operation), and technical (handmade technology). The ability to start a business, and the last P represents Practical training. It can be said that it is a unique niche of Shuheyuan. It can introduce students to the farming environment and lead the internship by the master.

In view of the fact that ""if there is no talent in an industry, there is no opportunity"", and in order to promote ""slashing and entrepreneurship, cultivating friendly farmers,"" Chen Mengkai also cooperated with the Zhongwei Center to start classes, hoping to let more people know about friendly environmental agriculture. It is important to support friendly environmental ingredients and to have sufficient capacity for those who want to join the friendly farming industry. It is possible to go on a long-term road to local creation.
From hands-on implementation to actual sales, Shuheyuan is an entrepreneur who has the heart to go into the place, gradually realize the dream with a slash and lean way, and reduce the risk of entrepreneurship.
