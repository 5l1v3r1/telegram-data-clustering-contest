      <p>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — A report says the public defender agency is passing off more cases to the Office of Public Advocacy due to conflicts of interest with other cases or clients.</p>
      <p>The report from a state oversight unit says the number of conflicts jeopardizes the primary defense role the agency plays.</p>
      <p>It says the more cases the agency can’t do, the more the Office of Public Advocacy and contract attorneys will do.</p>
      <p>The report also says the public defender agency inconsistently reports the number of cases it has and says the agency would be more efficient with more support staff.</p>
      <p>An email seeking comment was sent to Public Defender Samantha Cherot.</p>
      <p>Quinlan Steiner, before resigning as public defender this year, tried to make a case for additional funding to support the agency’s caseload.</p>
