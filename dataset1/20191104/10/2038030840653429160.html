      <h1>WATCH: Prince Harry's swoon-worthy response to a fan calling him handsome will make your day</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T10:50:24+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 10:50</time> by <a rel="author">Bashiera Parker (@bparks_)</a></address>
      <p>Cape Town – Before <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/Royal-News/watch-prince-harry-enjoys-a-cold-one-with-the-bokke-after-rugby-world-cup-win-20191102"><b>celebrating with the Springboks</b></a> following their Rugby World Cup win this weekend, Prince Harry met with Paralympic hopefuls in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>At the Para Arena training centre – a fully accessible venue to provide equal opportunities to the local community – the Duke of Sussex observed as students participated in wheelchair boccia, powerlifting, and of course, rugby.</p>
      <p>"This was especially meaningful to His Royal Highness, who five years ago founded @WeAreInvictusGames – which uses the power of sport to inspire recovery and support rehabilitation of wounded veterans who have physical or mental injuries," explains the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4WuN3ZlHj5/"><b>Sussex Royal Instagram account</b></a>.</p>
      <p>"Japan is the first-ever country to host two Paralympic Games! Next year Tokyo will welcome over 4 000 athletes from around the world, creating a huge opportunity to help celebrate and promote diversity."</p>

      <p>Before leaving the centre, His Royal Highness greeted and posed with schoolchildren who were clearly taken by the duke – and the precious exchange was captured on camera.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29677188/prince-harry-handsome-married-video/"><b>Harper's BAZAAR</b></a>, in a brief moment, one of Harry's very many admirers caught his attention when they commented on how "handsome" the real-life prince was.</p>
      <p>"I'm married," Harry quipped, playfully holding up his left hand and pointing to his ring finger.</p>
      <p>The crowd erupted in laughter before he made his exit and though Meghan stayed home with Archie on this particular trip, we're guessing she did too after seeing his swoon-worthy response.</p>
