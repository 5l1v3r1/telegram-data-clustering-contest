        <i>Welcome to <a href="https://thenextweb.com/basics/">TNW Basics</a>, a collection of tips, guides, and advice on how to easily get the most out of your gadgets, apps, and other stuff.</i>
      </p>
      <p>It happened. It finally happened: iTunes is dead.</p>
      <p>I’ve got to say, <a href="https://thenextweb.com/just-putting-it-out-there/2019/09/22/just-putting-out-there-love-itunes/">I wasn’t really the hugest fan of Apple’s decision to kill its media software</a> and replace it with standalone apps. I thought it’d mark the beginning of a new era where the company tried to force Apple Music on everyone, disregarding all of us who used iTunes solely as music library.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, it looks like I was wrong. The new macOS Music app is simple, elegant, and basically identical to iTunes — minus a lot of the bloat. Basically, it’s not too bad.</p>
      <p>But, there’s one element that’s pretty annoying for non-users of the Apple Music streaming service: the inclusion of, uh, the Apple Music streaming service on the sidebar. Basically, this:</p>

        <figcaption>Ugh, so ugly.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I really couldn’t care less about Apple Music. I want to use the macOS Music App for my <i>own</i> music library, and have it feel like it was designed for that purpose. In other words, I want the Apple Music category out of the sidebar.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, that’s actually possible.</p>
      <p>Yes, in a very non-Apple sort of move, you can remove both the iTunes Store and Apple Music categories from the macOS Music app. Even better, it’s easy as hell.</p>
      <h3>#1: Open the macOS Music app</h3>
      <p>You know, click on the icon. This icon:</p>

        <figcaption>Just in case it’s not clear, it’s the one in the middle.</figcaption>

      <h3>#2: Go into preferences</h3>
      <p>Find that in the menu here:</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>#3: Click on the ‘Restrictions’ option</h3>
      <p>It’ll look like this when you’re successful:</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>#4: Disable ‘Apple Music’</h3>
      <p>Click on that lovely little box, which will look like this:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-10-30-at-12.31.09-796x534.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>As a note, you can also click “iTunes Store” too, and that’ll remove that option from the sidebar as well.</p>
      <h3>#5: Soak up that Apple Music-free macOS Music app</h3>
      <p>Mmm, delicious.</p>

      <p>So, there you go! A nice little explainer on how to make the new macOS Music app feel better if you’re just using it for your own music library.</p>
      <p>Maybe the death of iTunes isn’t all that bad after all.</p>
