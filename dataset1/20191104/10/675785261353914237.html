      <h2>Kate Middleton had the chance to meet the mums and dads of kids in Princess Charlotte's class at meet and greet drinks, which was held at one of Prince Harry's old hangouts before he married Meghan Markle</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T10:30:14+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 10:30</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Forsey, https://www.facebook.com/zoeforseymirror/</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kate-middleton">Duchess of Cambridge</a> popped to the pub with a group of other mums from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-george">Prince George</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/princess-charlotte">Princess Charlotte</a> 's school - and she managed to go undetected thanks to a secret door set up for Harry.</p>
      <p>Kate attended Thomas's Battersea's 'meet and greet' drinks party for parents of children who joined the school in September, including little Charlotte.</p>
      <p>The event was held at the Hollywood Arms in Chelsea, which used to be a popular hangout for London socialites.</p>
      <p>Kate's brother-in-law <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a> used to be a regular there, so much so that the former owners created a secret entrance for him so he could come and go without being photographed, reports the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7643339/TALK-TOWN-Kates-secret-door-school-run-mums-bash-courtesy-Prince-Harry.html">Mail on Sunday</a> .</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>While a more relaxed location now, the pub used to be known for its wild parties and impressive guestlists.</p>
      <p>The school event was held in the pub's private room the Boulevard Bar, which costs £2,500 to hire for the evening.</p>
      <p>Kate had just one protection officer with her who was in the background while she chatted with the other mums and dads.</p>
      <p>The Duchess and husband Prince William are regulars on the school run, and are often spotted dropping George and Charlotte off at the gates.</p>

      <p>And while you might expect that the other people in the playground would be very excited to see the royals every day, it turns out people barely look at them any more.</p>
      <p>But one parent told the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5976287/Revealing-portrait-Prince-George-fifth-birthday.html">Daily Mail</a> there's actually another mum who people find a lot more interesting than Kate and Wills - especially the dads.</p>
      <p>They said: "No one really gives Kate a second glance when she does the school drop-off.</p>
      <p>"We have a Victoria's Secret model doing the school run, too, and the dads are far more interested in her!"</p>
