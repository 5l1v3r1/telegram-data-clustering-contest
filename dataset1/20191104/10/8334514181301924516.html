      <p>MADRID (Reuters) - Santander (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/SAN.MC">SAN.MC</a>) has taken a 350 million pound ($453 million) majority stake in UK-based Ebury as part of a digital strategy to boost growth through new ventures, the Spanish bank announced on Monday.</p>
      <p>Ebury is a trade and foreign exchange facilitator for small and medium-sized companies which operates in 19 countries and 140 currencies, Santander said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Santander said it is acquiring 50.1% of Ebury for 350 million pounds, of which 70 million will be new primary equity to support Ebury’s plans to enter new markets in Latin America and Asia.</p>
      <p>The bank said it expects a return on invested capital (RoIC) higher than 25% in 2024.</p>
      <p>“Small and medium-sized businesses are a major engine of growth around the world, creating new jobs and contributing up to 60% of total employment and up to 40% of national GDP in emerging economies,” said Santander executive chairman Ana Botin.</p>
      <p>Like banks across Europe, Spanish lenders have turned to more profitable enterprise lending in a bid to lift earnings as low interest rates squeeze financial margins.</p>
      <p>Santander is also focusing on emerging economies while cutting costs to counter squeezed margins from ultra-low interest rates in mature European markets.</p>
      <p>Santander said Ebury’s existing investors, including co-founders and management, would reinvest in the transaction and the current management team will remain.</p>
      <p>Ebury has generated average annual revenue growth of 40% in the last three years, Santander said in its statement.</p>
