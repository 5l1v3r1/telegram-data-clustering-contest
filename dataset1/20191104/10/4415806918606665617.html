      <p>Paddy McGuinness has told of his anger after a stranger questioned why he had parked in a blue badge space when he and his children “don’t look disabled”.</p>
      <p>The TV star, whose six-year-old twins Leo and Penelope have autism, said he was dropping his children off at a play centre when the man approached.</p>
      <p>Posting on Twitter, he said while he wanted to “bounce him off every car”, he instead took a deep breath.</p>
      <p>McGuinness said: “Just had a deep breathe and walk away moment.</p>
      <p>“Dropped my little ones off at a play centre.</p>
      <p>“Parked in a disability space while they got out. Had all our relevant disability badges on display only for some bell end to come over and tell us that we don’t look disabled? #ignorance.</p>

      <p>“I took a deep breathe and sent my children in. Luckily they didn’t understand what was going on?</p>
      <p>“Once they’d happily gone in I approached this ignorant tool. All I wanted to do was bounce him off every car but there would only be one loser in that, me!”</p>

      <p>The presenter said he “tried to explain to him that not all disabilities are the same”.</p>
      <p>“The ignorance and sheer pomposity of telling someone they don’t look disabled really makes my blood boil! How does someone have to look to have a disability?” he said.</p>

      <p>He went on: “This sad individual was also parked in a disability bay? He was able bodied but it would never cross my mind to ask him what his disability was as he could clearly walk?</p>
      <p>“Unless you get a blue badge for being an ignorant p****? He was clearly qualified.”</p>

      <p>McGuinness said a few years back it would’ve been “a different outcome”.</p>
      <p>He said: “He’d be on his arse and putting a call in to the tabloids.</p>
      <p>“I would’ve been vilified and labelled a thug. My wife and children would’ve been upset and I’d more than likely be out of a job.”</p>

      <p>The star, who has three children with his wife Christine, went on: “I’m so glad I took that deep breathe and handled the situation calmly.</p>
      <p>“I feel better for it and hopefully that ignorant person might think twice next time or indeed learn that all disabilities are different.”</p>

      <p>He urged others: “If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, stay calm, take the deep breathe and educate the ignorant.</p>
