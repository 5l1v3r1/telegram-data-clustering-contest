      <h1>Saudi Aramco valuation in bank research may vary by more than $1 trillion</h1>
      <h2>Aramco could offer 1%-2% of its shares, raising as much as $20 billion to $40 billion</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T10:31:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 10:31</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Valuations for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/saudi-aramco">Saudi Aramco </a>vary by more than $1 trillion (Â£774 billion), according to fund managers who have seen banks' research, underscoring the uncertainty hanging over what could be the world's largest stock market listing.</p>
      <p>Fund managers are poring over bank research after Aramco on Sunday announced its intention to float on the Riyadh stock market.</p>
      <p>Sources have told Reuters that Aramco could offer 1%-2% of its shares, raising as much as $20 billion to $40 billion. A deal over $25 billion would top the record-breaking IPO of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, however, Aramco provided no size of the planned IPO, no timeframe, identified no cornerstone investors and gave no information on an expected follow-up listing overseas.</p>
      <p>Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has spoken of a $2 trillion value target for the world's largest oil producer while banks have provided varying figures.</p>
      <p>Bank of America (BOFA) Merrill Lynch estimates Aramco's valuation at $1.2 trillion to $2.3 trillion while EFG Hermes has a valuation of $1.55 trillion to $2.1 trillion, two fund managers who have seen the research reports told Reuters.</p>
      <p>Goldman Sachs - one of the banks coordinating the IPO - has put the company's valuation between $1.6 trillion and $2.3 trillion, two sources said.</p>
      <p>Bernstein analysts estimated "a fair value range" for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/saudi-aramco">Saudi Aramco </a>is $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion.</p>
      <p>"Our discounted cash flow approaches... suggest $1.4 trillion on average," it said.</p>
      <p>BOFA Merrill's has also used the discounted cash flow model, a valuation methodology that uses future cash flow, according to one fund manager who saw the research.</p>
      <p>The banks were not immediately available for comment.</p>
      <p>Credit Suisse's research offers a similarly wide range in value, the fund manager said.</p>
      <p>"These ranges are always wide as research analysts want to cover both low end and high end so you want to show sensitivity of assumptions," one analyst said.</p>
      <p>EFG Hermes research implies a 2020 estimated enterprise value to EBITDA ratio of 6.9 times to 9.4 times, a price-to earnings ratio of 14.5 times to 19.5 times, and a dividend yield of 3.9% to 5.3%.</p>
