LATOKEN Launches an IEO of Economic Interest in SpaceX to Hedge Dino Asteroid Disaster

04 Nov 2019, 10:15

Valentin Preobrazhenskiy, CEO of LATOKEN, commented:
“USPX token sparks the dream to unite people to explore an alternative planet to settle and hedge from an asteroid type of disaster. Something that dinosaurs did not manage to structure.It also gives a great opportunity to test the legal structure and business model to provide worldwide liquidity for assets previously not available to most investors. This could turn a great many people into stakeholders in the success of humanity and help to manage planetary resources for a better future, human wealth and wellbeing.That’s not going to be easy. There are many mistakes and pitfalls to overcome to solve the problems of information asymmetry, the enforceability of contracts, and regulatory compliance across multiple regions.I admire startups taking care of it while still having the courage to pioneer such powerful innovation. They could democratize capital markets and incentivise more people to learn how real-time events affect the value of their investments and the future performance of the global economy. That should help to solve long-term problems of environment, human rights, trade barriers, poverty, and education. Let’s make people global stakeholders in a sustainable future.”
