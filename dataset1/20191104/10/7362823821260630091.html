But he says these times are like no other. The veteran anchor sat down with the FOX News Rundown to discuss why covering the news in 2019 and President Trump is different than any other time.<br/> <br/>Also on the Rundown: Nearly half of voters want to see President Trump impeached and removed from office according to a new FOX News Poll. This comes after the House voted on a resolution to move forward with the impeachment inquiry on Thursday. FOX’s David Spunt is at the White House, and he weighs in on how the president and Democratic presidential candidates are reacting. <br/> <br/>Plus, commentary by Tucker Carlson, host of “Tucker Carlson Tonight."</p>
