      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/chelsea-fc-0">Chelsea</a>’s appeal against their transfer ban will be heard at  the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/court-of-arbitration-for-sport">Court of Arbitration for Sport</a> on November 20.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/cas">CAS</a> will rule on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/FIFA">FIFA</a>’s punishment with the Blues said to have broken rules to sign youth players from abroad.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/cas">CAS</a> intend to conclude matters before the January transfer window opens, thus allowing Frank Lampard to potentially bolster his squad.</p>
      <p>Chelsea already served half of its one-year ban on registering new players during the offseason trading period.</p>
      <p>The club did not seek to freeze the FIFA sanction while preparing the appeal to CAS.</p>
      <p>FIFA’s disciplinary and appeal committees have said Chelsea violated 150 rules protecting minors from trafficking. Those cases involved about 70 players.</p>
      <p>Chelsea was also judged to break rules prohibiting third-party influence on players. FIFA imposed a fine of 600,000 Swiss francs ($608,000).</p>
      <p>The club has denied wrongdoing.</p>
