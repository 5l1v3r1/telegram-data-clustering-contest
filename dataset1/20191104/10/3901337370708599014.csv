Benni McCarthy has opened up publicly for the first time after his contract with Cape Town City was terminated.
The Citizens announced at midnight that the 41-year-old’s contract was terminated with immediate effect following a bad run of results for the Mother City-based outfit.
“Cape Town City Football Club has terminated the employment of coach Benni McCarthy, with immediate effect following a run of performance that saw the club win 2 in the last 18 games,” City said in part on their official Twitter account. 
However, Coach ‘Benni’ has since broken his silence on the matter, taking to his personal social media accounts to reveal his disappointment. 
“I’m disappointed to end my time at the Club but I would like to nevertheless thank the Club, & particularly the players, the fans and the community of Cape Town for their support and commitment over the last two years. I’m proud of my time at the Club and wish them all the best,” the former Bafana Bafana international said on his official Twitter account.



The Citizens are expected to make an official announcement about a new head coach, but in the meantime, Vasili Manousakis takes over the helm in the interim.
