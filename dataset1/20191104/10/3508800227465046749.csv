當我們失去了維園
04 Nov 2019, 10:24 by 譚蕙芸


我們想讓你知道的是維多利亞公園那曾經容納過過萬計集會人士的草坪、足球場，升起陣陣白煙，警方在這裡發射了一發又一發的催淚彈。這一片曾經標誌着幾代香港人抗爭歷史的集會勝地，終於淪陷。



維多利亞公園，對香港人來說，是非一般公園。它在香港集會遊行的歷史上，有着標誌性意義。每年六月四日晚，維園點起一片燭光如海，三十年不滅，即使人數有起有跌，「坐滿維園多少個足球場」成為了老香港人良知的呼喚，讓人知道，還有人拒絕遺忘。
每逢7月1日香港回歸、10月1日國慶，維園更是兵家必爭之地，不同陣營組織向有關當局入紙申請，搶奪維園活動的舉辦權，那時，「合法集會」還是有一點空間。有時建制派取得了足球場活動權，泛民集會人士擠在旁邊的草地上，一幅高空照片，那一邊空洞洞，那一邊人頭湧湧，圖片說明一切，見證香港和平集會的歷史足印。2003年七一遊行，從維園溢出來的人潮，間接促成前特首董建華下台。
在傳媒史上，維園也有其重要角色，香港其中一個最長壽的直播論政節目，「城市論壇」始自殖民地時代已在維多利亞公園涼亭舉行，左中右陣營政治人物聚頭這個戶外空間，舌劍唇槍，有時吵得動手動腳，出動保安維持秩序，但也把維園奠定為一個包容空間，讓民間多元聲音可以發聲，這片園地，具標誌性意義。
數年前，《明報》總編輯換人，我作為前《明報》僱員表達關注，也曾出席維園城市論壇，記得香港電台的製作人，抓破頭也希望找到不同立場者出席，是舊派人信奉那種文明理性，相信真理越辯越明。
選舉聚會與非法集結
昨日（11月2日），維多利亞公園作為一個包容開放的公共空間的角色狠狠地被蹂躪。警方拒絕了維園的集會申請，適逢11月底為區議會選舉，百多名民主派候選人運用《公安條例》賦予的權利，表示他們會在維園各自舉行「選舉聚會」。根據《公安條例》，若出席人數不超過50人，則無須通知警務處處長。
然而，大批防暴警察，在下午待在維多利亞公園外，有人群湧出馬路，警方強烈警告，但即使人群退回公園範圍內，警察卻沒有停止行動，一步一步進逼，直至闖進公園心臟，甚至在綠油油的草地上，發射了催淚彈。
下午3時許，大批候選人和支持者，舉着選舉直幡，於維多利亞公園近銅鑼灣出口，與警方對峙。女警喊破喉嚨警告：「你們選舉集會是另一件事，你們在參與非法集結，警務處長已禁止集會，上訴條例也沒有推翻決定……」女警用擴音器喊話時，說出「刑事罪行」「刑事檢控」等字眼，咬字上加倍用力。多名候選人不甘示弱，不斷反挑戰：「我們在舉行選舉集會，警方勿打壓選舉自由！」

女警發難：「戴眼鏡穿短袖藍衣的X先生，我警告你，別煽動現場人士干犯罪行，你望一望後面，有大批蒙面黑衣人。」另一批男警也用咪高鋒調侃候選人：「候選人？經常在演戲，對與錯也不懂得分辨，你如何做候選人？本末倒置！」有候選人卻半開玩笑說：「阿Sir，記得投票呀！你也有投票權的！」
忽然，警察和候選人在討論政治權利。因為候選人都把自己的臉，名字，全部印在直幡上，又把名字印在布條掛在身上，讓警察大聲點名稱呼各人為「Ｘ先生」。有一下，雙方拉扯，警方嘗試扯掉其中一名候選人的口罩，表示跟據反蒙面法，可以這樣做。
戴上防毒面具、手持胡椒噴霧催淚彈
有候選人自言自己身份在陽光下，反諷警察：「你是不是警察我們也不知道，沒有編號，蒙着面，你除下口罩，給我看委任証，否則你甚麼也不是！」女警大喊：「我命令你們立即沿維園離開！Apple 2 (小隊名）戴防毒面具，charge!」說完，下午4時，女警指揮防暴警進入維多利亞公園範圍，候選人和支持者們，後退着，卻一直面對防暴警員，嗌口號反駁。
女警：「走！走！馬上離開！你們是不是不懂得聽廣東話？」
眾反駁：「你們識不識選舉條例，你們正打壓選舉公平公正！」
女警逼緊：「一句到尾，你們走！你將來到法庭跟法官說（你的理據）吧！」
候選人不讓步，前仆後繼地發聲，有節奏有默契地喊着：「（男聲）我是大埔區議會候人XXX，我是沙田區候選人XXX （女聲）：我是荃灣區候選人XXX」，申訴之聲此起彼落。即使警方推着盾牌步步進逼，眾候選人們還是挻着胸，互相扶持着大家的衫領，緩緩後退。

女警指着最前的候選人陳振哲：「陳先生，不是這樣「出位的」（搶傳媒關注），你現在犯法，也在教唆別人犯法呀，你干犯刑事，你要找數的（付出代價），別以為選舉就甚麼也可以做。」
陳回話：「你們這批自稱是警察的人聽着，這是公園範圍，我在做選舉集會，根據選舉條例，候選人可以做選舉集會，五十人以下不需要通知警方，不需要得到你批准的。若你現在拘捕就是濫捕，是你們（警方）犯法！香港搞到今天這田地，是因為大家沒有做好本份，香港警察沒有做回自己本份！」
眾候選人即使後退，也一起嗌着口號：「我有權集會！無須警方批准！破壞選舉工程！打壓合法集會！」氣氛如箭在弦。
雙方對峙十來分鐘，警方不斷重覆指責在場人士非法集會，而拿咪高鋒的警員，已悄悄在口袋內拿出兩樣武器用手指夾着，一枝胡椒噴霧，另一個是手擲式催淚彈。有人見狀大喊：「大家留意，有手擲式催淚彈。」候選人回罵：「我們身上沒有裝備，甚麼也沒有！」警員已經戴上了俗稱豬嘴的防毒面具，看不到他們的眼神了。
拘捕候選人，發射催淚彈
雙方對峙已到達公園涼亭，那個數十年來舉辦城市論壇的勝地，今日見證着政治權利被打壓，默默無聲。香港這天天氣晴朗，初秋的晴空藍天白雲，維園的大樹林蔭下，兩方嘶破喉嚨喊話，鳥鳴卻婉轉響亮。此時，頭頂又響起隆隆的聲音，政府監察人群的直升機在高空盤旋，令人焦慮。
忽爾，一陣推撞，警方衝前把其中一名候選人，已屆中年俗稱「機場大叔」的陳振哲壓在地上（他曾在早前機場衝突中擔任緩衝角色，化解事情，獲得此稱號）。防暴警察用膝頭壓着他胸口，他滿臉是胡椒噴霧的白色泡沫，另外警棍壓着他的手，他的眼鏡歪了，他嘗試伸手扶正，手機掉在地上，再有警員上前向他的臉直噴胡椒，陳喊道：「我沒法子呼吸。」有人喊：「別再噴了。」大叔說道：「我沒有反抗呀。」他被鎖上手扣。混亂之中，有三名區議會候選人被拘捕。

其後，警方繼續推進，群眾憤怒：「釋放候選人！」警方最後只喝罵：「收聲啦！繼續離開！」
候選人還是挺着腰，向着戴着全副武裝，密封着臉的防暴警痛陳：「候選人有沒有權集會？香港有公民及政治權利公約，我們的選舉聚會如何令人懼怕？如何破壞社會安靜？」警棍和盾牌，把候選人的聲音，推到維多利亞公園另一端的出口。
有候選人曾經在與警方對峙之中，說了語帶雙關的話：「究竟我們要後退到哪裡？你的封鎖線在哪裡？後退夠了，香港人！給我們一條生路吧，我們的路在哪裡？」前無退路，後有追兵，同一時間，維多利亞公園那曾經容納過過萬計集會人士的草坪、足球場，升起陣陣白煙，警方在這裡發射了一發又一發的催淚彈。這一片曾經標誌着幾代香港人抗爭歷史的集會勝地，終於淪陷。
陳振哲是大埔林村谷選區的候選人，該區還有經民聯的陳灶良。

When we lost Victoria Park
04 Nov 2019, 10:24 by Tan Wei


What we want you to know is that the lawns and football fields in Victoria Park, which once accommodated thousands of people in the assembly, raised white smoke, and the police fired tear gas bombs again and again. This film has once marked the end of several generations of Hong Kong people's struggle against history, and finally fell.



Victoria Park is a non-general park for Hong Kong people. It has a symbolic significance in the history of Hong Kong's rally. On the evening of June 4th every year, Victoria Park will light up a candle like the sea. It will not die for 30 years. Even if the number of people rises and falls, ""how many football fields are filled with Victoria Park"" has become the call of the conscience of the old Hong Kong people. Some people refuse to forget.
On July 1st, the return of Hong Kong and the National Day on October 1st, Victoria Park is a battleground for the military. Different camp organizations applied to the relevant authorities to seize the right to host the Victoria Park. At that time, ""legal assembly"" There is still a little space. Sometimes the founding faction has the right to participate in the football field. The people gathered in the grass on the grass next to it, a high-altitude photo, a hollow hole on the other side, the crowd is crowded, the picture shows everything, witnessing the historical footprint of the Hong Kong Peaceful Rally . In the July 1st Parade in 2003, the crowds overflowing from Victoria Park indirectly contributed to the departure of former Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.
In the history of the media, Victoria Park also has an important role. One of Hong Kong's longest-lived live speech programs, the ""Urban Forum"" has been held in the gazebo of Victoria Park since the colonial era. The left and right camp politicians gather this outdoor space, tongue Sword and lip guns, sometimes noisy manual feet, dispatched security to maintain order, but also laid the Victoria Park as an inclusive space, so that the folk multi-voice can speak, this field, with a symbolic significance.
A few years ago, the editor-in-chief of Ming Pao changed. I expressed my concern as an employee of the former Ming Pao. I also attended the Victoria Park Urban Forum. I remember that the producers of Radio Television Hong Kong, who are trying to find a different position, are old. Send people to believe in the civilized rationality, and believe that the truth is more and more clarified.
Election party and illegal assembly
Yesterday (November 2nd), Victoria Park was smashed as an inclusive public space. The police rejected the application for the assembly of Victoria Park. It was the district council election at the end of November. More than 100 democratic candidates used the rights conferred by the Public Order Ordinance to say that they would hold ""election gatherings"" in Victoria Park. According to the Public Order Ordinance, if the number of attendees does not exceed 50, it is not necessary to notify the Commissioner of Police.
However, a large number of riot police stayed outside Victoria Park in the afternoon, and crowds rushed out of the road. The police strongly warned, but even if the crowd returned to the park, the police did not stop the action, step by step, until they broke into the heart of the park, even in the green On the grass, a tear gas bomb was fired.
At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, a large number of candidates and supporters, holding elections, went to the Victoria Park near Causeway Bay and confronted the police. The policewoman shouted the throat and warned: ""It is another thing for you to elect a rally. You are involved in illegal assembly. The police chief has banned the assembly. The appeals regulations have not overturned the decision..."" When the policewoman yelled at the loudspeaker, she said The words ""criminal offences"" and ""criminal prosecutions"" are more powerful in biting words. Many candidates are not willing to show weakness and continue to challenge: ""We are holding elections and the police do not suppress the freedom of election!""

The policewoman is in trouble: ""Mr. X wearing glasses and short-sleeved blue, I warn you, don't shake the scene to commit crimes. You look at the back and there are a large number of masked black people."" Another group of policemen also used microphones. Gao Feng ridiculed the candidate: ""Candidates? Often acting, right and wrong do not know how to distinguish, how do you make a candidate? The end of the game!"" Some candidates are half jokingly said: ""A Sir, remember to vote! You also have a vote Right!""
Suddenly, the police and candidates are discussing political rights. Because the candidates printed their faces and names on the straight, and printed the name on the cloth, let the police call out the name to Mr. X. One thing, the two sides pulled, the police tried to tear off the mask of one of the candidates, saying that according to the anti-mask law, you can do so.
Put on a gas mask, hold a pepper spray, tear gas
Some candidates say that their identity is in the sun, irony police: ""You are not a policeman, we don't know, no number, covered face, you remove the mask, show me the warrant card, otherwise you are nothing!"" The police shouted: ""I ordered you to leave along the Victoria Park immediately! Apple 2 (small team name) wearing a gas mask, charge!"" After that, at 4 pm, the policewoman commanded the riot police to enter the Victoria Park area, candidates and supporters Retired, but has been facing riot police officers, slogans refuted.
Policewoman: ""Go! Go! Leave now! Do you not know how to listen to Cantonese?""
Refutation: ""You don't know the election regulations. You are suppressing the election fairness and justice!""
The policewoman is pressing: ""One sentence to the end, you go! You will come to the court to tell the judge (your reason)!""
The candidate did not give in, the former singer followed, and rhythm and tacitly shouted: ""(Male voice) I am a candidate for the Tai Po District Council XXX, I am a candidate for Sha Tin District XXX (Female Voice): I am a candidate for Tsuen Wan District XXX"" The voice of the complaint has risen and fallen. Even if the police pushed the shield step by step, the candidates were still licking their chests, supporting each other's collars and slowly retreating.

The policewoman pointed to the former candidate Chen Zhenzhe: ""Mr. Chen, it is not like this."" (Catch the media attention), you are breaking the law now, and you are also betting others to break the law. You are criminal, you have to find the number (pay the price) ), don't think that elections can do anything. ""
Chen Huihua: ""You guys who claim to be policemen listen, this is the scope of the park. I am doing election gatherings. According to the election regulations, candidates can do election gatherings. There is no need to notify the police for 50 people or less. If you arrested it now, it is an over-the-counter arrest. It is your (police) offence! Hong Kong got this field today because everyone did not do their part and the Hong Kong police did not do their part!""
Even if the candidates retreat, they slogan together: ""I have the right to meet! No police approval! Destroy the election project! Suppress the legal assembly!"" The atmosphere is in the air.
The two sides confronted each other for ten minutes. The police repeatedly repeatedly accused the people present of illegal gatherings. The police officer of Naomi Gaofeng had quietly put two weapons in his pocket and held them with his fingers. One pepper spray and the other hand-throwing. Tears. Someone screamed: ""Everyone noticed that there is a hand-throwing tear gas."" The candidate replied: ""We have no equipment and nothing!"" The police officers have put on gas masks commonly known as pigs and can't see them. The eyes are gone.
Arrested the candidate and fired tear gas
The two sides have already arrived at the park pavilion, the resort that hosted the city forum for decades, and today witnessed the suppression of political rights and silence. The weather in Hong Kong was fine this day. The clear blue sky and white clouds in the early autumn, the shade of the big trees in the Victoria Park, the two sides smashed their throats and shouted, but the birds were screaming loudly. At this time, the top of the head rang again, and the helicopters that the government monitored the crowd hovered at high altitude, which was anxious.
Suddenly, when the police rushed forward, the police rushed to one of the candidates, Chen Zhenzhe, who had been called ""the airport uncle"" in the middle ages, and pressed him to the ground (he used to act as a buffer in the airport conflict earlier, to resolve the matter and get this title. ). The riot police pressed his chest against his chest. His face was white foam of pepper spray. The baton pressed his hand. His glasses were smashed. He tried to reach out and right, the phone fell to the ground, and the policeman went forward. His face squirted pepper directly, and Chen shouted, ""I can't breathe."" Someone shouted, ""Don't spray again."" Uncle said, ""I didn't resist."" He was locked with a buckle. In the midst of chaos, three District Council candidates were arrested.

Later, the police continued to advance, and the masses were angry: ""Release the candidate!"" The police finally only yelled: ""Receive the voice! Keep leaving!""
The candidate is still quite awkward, facing the riot police wearing a fully armed and sealed face. ""Does the candidate have the right to assemble? Hong Kong has a convention on civil and political rights. How can our election gathering be fearful? How to undermine society? Quiet?"" The batons and shields pushed the candidate's voice to the exit at the other end of Victoria Park.
Some candidates have spoken in the confrontation with the police and said: ""Where do we have to go back? Where is your blockade? Retreat enough, Hong Kong people! Give us a way to live, our way is Where?” There was no retreat before, and there was a chase afterwards. At the same time, the lawns and football fields of Victoria Park, which had once accommodated thousands of people gathered, raised white smoke. The police fired one after another. Tears. This film has once marked the end of several generations of Hong Kong people's struggle against history, and finally fell.
Chen Zhenzhe is a candidate for the Lincun Valley Constituency in Tai Po. There are also Chen Zaoliang of the People's Federation in the district.
