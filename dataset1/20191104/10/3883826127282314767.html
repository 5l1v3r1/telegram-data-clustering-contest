        <b>Eight suspects have been held in Vietnam after 39 people were found dead in a lorry in Essex.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The arrests came as a team of Vietnamese officials arrived in Britain to help formally identify the 31 men and eight women.</p>
      <p>The suspects are being held in relation to people smuggling offences, the director of police in the Nghe An province in north-central Vietnam said.</p>
      <p>Two people were arrested in the Ha Tinh province of Vietnam last week.</p>
      <p>The victims were discovered in a refrigerated lorry trailer on an industrial estate in Grays on 23 October.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Essex Police said all 39 people were believed to be Vietnamese.</p>
      <p>The force initially said it believed they were Chinese.</p>
