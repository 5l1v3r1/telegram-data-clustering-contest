      <p>Awan said the premier has reassured of the government’s commitment and said, “State comes first and then comes politics.”</p>
      <p>“We will not let the state become weak. In the eyes of law, everyone is equal and the same law is applied to everyone.”</p>
      <p>“The dharna is a violation of the Supreme Court’s decision. The protesters had conditional permission for the jalsa only and not to stage a dharna.”</p>
