川普批他是騙子 電話門吹哨者願接受共和黨提問

（中央社華盛頓3日綜合外電報導）一名美國官員日前爆料總統川普企圖施壓烏克蘭調查政敵拜登，促使聯邦眾議院啟動彈劾調查。這名吹哨者的律師說，他的客戶願意回答情報委員會共和黨成員提出的書面問題。
吹哨者的律師柴德（Mark Zaid）說，此舉是為了回應在川普主導下，共和黨人試圖揭發吹哨者身分一事。這名吹哨者是美國情報界的一員，真實身分尚未曝光。
柴德在推特寫道，共和黨人「試圖揭發我們客戶的身分，這可能危害他和家人的安全」。
川普今早推文說，應該揭發吹哨者的身分，因為他提供了不實資訊，稍後又在白宮外稱這名吹哨者是「歐巴馬支持者」和騙子，「這名吹哨者應該被揭發」。
這名不具名美國情報官員提出揭密者檢舉函後，聯邦眾議院9月24日正式對川普展開彈劾調查。
然而，隨著調查進入第6週，這名吹哨者根據第二手消息所做的證詞，或許已不是最重要。
率領調查的國會議員已聆聽多名官員提供第一手消息，包括前國家安全會議（NSC）成員、陸軍中校文德曼（Alexander Vindman）。文德曼為川普企圖施壓烏克蘭調查2020年大選民主黨參選人拜登（Joe Biden）和他的兒子韓特（Hunter Biden），以及川普將3.91億美元軍事援助當作籌碼等指控作證。
白宮公布川普與烏克蘭總統澤倫斯基（Volodymyr Zelenskiy）的通話摘要顯示，川普要求澤倫斯基調查拜登父子。
眾議院情報委員會（House Intelligence Committee）主席謝安達（Adam Schiff）上個月表示，這名吹哨者的證詞或許非必要。
柴德說，昨天向眾院情報委員會共和黨成員努尼斯（Devin Nunes）提出的選項，反映他的客戶希望以無黨派方式處理這項檢舉。
另一名吹哨者的律師巴卡伊（Andrew Bakaj）說：「讓我清楚闡明：我們願配合調查的立場未變。但我們反對且感受冒犯的是企圖揭露吹哨者身分的舉動。」
努尼斯的辦公室並未回應置評要求。
情委會長期以來的政策是保護吹哨者匿名舉報的權益。
謝安達在文德曼上週作證後說：「他們有權保持匿名。」（譯者：劉文瑜/核稿：陳昱婷）1081104
電話門風暴 川普：吹哨者供不實資訊應揭發身分
（中央社華盛頓3日綜合外電報導）美國總統川普日前被吹哨者舉發，疑似在7月通電話施壓烏克蘭總統澤倫斯基調查民主黨政敵拜登和他兒子。川普今天則表示，應該揭發這名吹哨者的身分，因為他提供了不實資訊。
路透社報導，川普在沒有提供證據的情況下，暗示這名吹哨者可能犯下詐欺罪。
川普在白宮告訴記者：「吹哨者應該被揭發，因為他提供不實資訊，他編造了故事。」
這名吹哨者的舉報，已經促成美國聯邦眾議院在10月31日以232票對196票通過一項決議案，決定針對川普正式展開嶄新且公開階段的彈劾調查。（譯者：陳彥鈞）1081104

Trump approved him as a liar. The telephone door whistle is willing to accept the Republican Party question.
04 Nov 2019, 10:04 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd, comprehensive foreign news report) A US official recently broke the news that President Trump attempted to pressure Ukrainian investigation of political opponent Biden, prompting the Federal House of Representatives to start impeachment investigation. The whistleblower’s lawyer said his client was willing to answer written questions from Republican members of the Intelligence Committee.
The whistleblower's lawyer, Mark Zaid, said the move was in response to a Republican attempt to expose the identity of the whistleblower under the leadership of Trump. The whistleblower is a member of the US intelligence community, and his true identity has not yet been revealed.
Chad is pushing the way, Republicans ""trying to expose the identity of our customers, which may endanger the safety of him and his family.""
Trump said this morning that the identity of the whistleblower should be revealed because he provided false information and later called the whistle-blower outside the White House ""Obama supporters"" and liar. ""This name The whistleblower should be revealed.""
After the unnamed US intelligence official filed a letter of disclosure by the revealer, the Federal House of Representatives officially launched an impeachment investigation on Trump on September 24.
However, as the investigation entered the sixth week, the testimony of the whistleblower based on the second-hand news may not be the most important.
Members of Congress who led the investigation have heard from a number of officials providing first-hand information, including former National Security Council (NSC) members and Army Colonel Alexander Vindman. Wendman urges Trump to pressure Ukraine to investigate 2020 election Democratic candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, and Trump’s 391 million US dollars in military aid as a chip testify.
The White House announced that summaries of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy showed that Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son.
The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, said last month that the testimony of the whistleblower may not be necessary.
Chaid said that the option proposed to Republican member Devin Nunes of the House Intelligence Committee yesterday reflected that his client wanted to deal with the report in a non-partisan manner.
Andrew Bakaj, another whistle-blower lawyer, said: ""Let me make it clear that our position to cooperate with the investigation has not changed. But what we oppose and feel offended is an attempt to expose the identity of the whistle.""
The office of Nunis did not respond to requests for comment.
The long-standing policy of the IC is to protect the rights of the whistleblower to report anonymously.
Xie Anda said after Wendman’s testimony last week: ""They have the right to remain anonymous."" (Translator: Liu Wenyu / Approved: Chen Yuting) 1081104
Telephone door storm Trump: whistleblower for false information should reveal identity
(Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd, comprehensive foreign news report) US President Trump was whistle-blowed by a whistle-blower. It is suspected that in July, telephone calls were made to pressure Ukrainian President Zelensky to investigate Democratic political opponents Biden and his son. Trump said today that the identity of the whistleblower should be revealed because he provided false information.
Reuters reported that Trump had suggested that the whistleblower could commit fraud.
Trump told reporters at the White House: ""The whistleblower should be revealed because he provided false information and he made up the story.""
The report of the whistle-blower has prompted the US House of Representatives to pass a resolution of 232 votes to 196 votes on October 31, and decided to officially launch a new and publicized impeachment investigation against Trump. (Translator: Chen Yanzhen) 1081104
