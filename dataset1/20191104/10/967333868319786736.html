      <p>Their latest, an EP titled Map of the Soul: Persona, sold 3.5 million copies worldwide in the six months since its release, 562,000 of those in the US alone.</p>
      <p>Last year BTS went on their third world tour - Love Yourself - which ended on 11 August, 2019 with a big show in the South Korean capital of Seoul.</p>
      <p>The following day, their music label BigHit Entertaiment announced that the boy band was taking an extended hiatus from performing to to relax and "enjoy the ordinary lives of young people in their 20s, albeit briefly". In October, the band made a comeback with a gig which marked their Saudi Arabia debut.</p>
