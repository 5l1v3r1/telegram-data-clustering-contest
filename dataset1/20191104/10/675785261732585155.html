      <h2>The X Factor boss says he came up with the idea for X Factor: The Band first as he prepares to launch the show</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T10:21:57+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 10:21</time> by <a rel="author">Vicki Newman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/vicki-newman/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> has scrapped his X Factor spin-off All Stars.</p>
      <p>A host of winners and contestants from across the years were set to battle it out in a new version of the ITV show next month.</p>
      <p>But after 2011 winners <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/little-mix">Little Mix</a> launched a rival BBC talent show, The Search, to put together a band to support them on their next tour, Simon changed his tactics.</p>
      <p>Now he's launching <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> : The Band instead, and the music mogul swears it was him who came up with the idea first.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a> : "This is what really happened. I was approached to co-produce that show last year by Little Mix’s management.</p>

      <p>"I told them the problem was we have a conflict of interest because we are launching X Factor The Band in 2020. We were told their show was going to launch in 2021.</p>
      <p>"Then we had the fallout and find out Little Mix were bringing their show forward. Was that intentional because we are doing our show? I have no idea. But regardless, it was too much fun not to do this year. I would rather it was us doing it first. It 100 per cent makes it more exciting there being a battle."</p>
      <p>The newspaper also reports that All Stars judges Louis Walsh and Paula Abdul are expected to be axed, with new judges put in place for The Band.</p>

      <p>The full All Stars line-up was not yet known, but Louis had previously told Mirror Online that Leona Lewis, Alexandra Burke and Shayne Ward had signed up to take part.</p>
      <p>And Joe McElderry told us he'd been asked to be on the show but turned it down.</p>
      <p>Auditions for the new show will take place soon at Sony Music in London, with the live finals held at Birmingham Arena the week of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> in December.</p>
      <p>Simon described it as "the perfect antidote to the doom and gloom".</p>

      <p>He said with K-Pop ruling the world, he wants to find a pop supergroup to rival the likes of boyband BTS.</p>
      <p>He said the winners of his new show will do more than get a record contract, they'll also launch a new wave of music, "UK-Pop".</p>
