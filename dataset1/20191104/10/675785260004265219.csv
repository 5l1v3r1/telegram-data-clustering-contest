Speaking about the forthcoming release Williams said, “I’m beyond excited to announce my first ever Christmas album. I’ve done a lot in my career and releasing this record is another dream come true. Making this album has been so much fun and I can’t wait for you all to hear it.”
The latest double album is Robbie's 13th and features guest appearances from fellow Brit stars like Rod Stewart and Jamie Cullen.

One collaboration that will definitely surprise fans on the album is Robbie's duet with controversial heavyweight boxer Tyson Fury .
The pair are favourites to hit the coveted Christmas number one spot this year with their track Bad Sharon - a catchy song about office Christmas party shenanigans (something we're sure many people will be able to relate to.
Robbie also worked with long-time collaborator Guy Chambers, who produced the majority of the record with Richard Flack.
