Jaylen Brown catches a virus; Semi Ojeleye catches a haircut

Poor Jaylen. The illness that forced him to miss two games last week (Milwaukee & NYN) just won’t quit. Here’s hoping he’s ready for the Spurs game.



Ojeleye must be two pounds lighter after removing that thing from his dome.
Semi and Carsen Edwards are both freshly buzzed. It’s probably not a coincidence both are struggling with their shot.
