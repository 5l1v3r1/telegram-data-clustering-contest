      <p>An advice columnist who has accused Donald Trump of raping her in a New York City department store dressing room in the 1990s has sued him, saying he defamed her by calling her a liar who he had never even met.</p>
      <p>E Jean Carroll’s lawsuit, filed in New York, says the president “smeared her integrity, honesty and dignity — all in the national press” when he responded to her allegations, first broached in a New York magazine article in June.</p>
      <p>“Nobody is entitled to conceal acts of sexual assault behind a wall of defamatory falsehoods and deflections,” Ms Carroll’s lawyer Roberta Kaplan wrote in the suit.</p>

      <p>Ms Carroll, a longtime advice columnist for Elle magazine, is among more than a dozen women who have accused Mr Trump of sexual misconduct or sexual assault or both, pre-dating his presidency.</p>
      <p>She is not the only one to sue over his denials. A case filed by Summer Zervos, a one-time contestant on his former reality show The Apprentice, is ongoing in the Manhattan court where Ms Carroll has filed her claim.</p>
      <p>In Ms Zervos’s case, Mr Trump’s lawyers have said his statements were not defamatory, and they have tried unsuccessfully to get the suit dismissed or at least delayed until he is no longer in office.</p>

      <p>Ms Carroll says she bumped into the then-property developer in the high-end store Bergdorf Goodman in 1995 or 1996, and he asked her to help him pick a gift for “a girl” and eventually suggested lingerie.</p>
      <p>He suggested Ms Carroll try on a see-through bodysuit, she said, and after a joking exchange, they went into a dressing room.</p>
      <p>She says he then pushed her against a wall, pulled down her tights and raped her as she struggled, eventually broke free and fled.</p>
      <p>Ms Carroll said there were no attendants in the dressing room area. She did not file a police report but said she told two journalist friends. Both have corroborated that they were told.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump said in June that Ms Carroll was “totally lying”, termed the accusation “fake news” and called her “not my type”.</p>
      <p>He also said he had never met her, although a 1987 photo shows him and Ms Carroll in a photo with their spouses at the time.</p>
      <p>The suit says Mr Trump harmed Ms Carroll’s reputation and career. It seeks unspecified damages.</p>
