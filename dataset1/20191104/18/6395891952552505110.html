      <p><b>BATON ROUGE, La.Â (AP)</b> - Louisiana's Republican gubernatorial candidate Eddie Rispone says a radio ad linking him and President Donald Trump to former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke is "disgusting."</p>
      <p>Rispone blames Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards for the advertising by the New Orleans-based Black Organization for Leadership Development, or BOLD.</p>
      <p>There's no evidence Edwards is connected to the effort, and Edwards spokesman Eric Holl says the campaign isn't responsible for the ad.</p>
      <p>The BOLD ad encourages minorities to "vote against hatred" by choosing Edwards. New Orleans Councilman Jay H. Banks ties Rispone and Trump to Duke , saying they don't care about "anyone who looks like you."</p>
      <p>Trump supports Rispone, who has responded with radio ads claiming that Edwards supporters hate the president.</p>
      <p>Early voting continues in the Nov. 16 election.</p>
