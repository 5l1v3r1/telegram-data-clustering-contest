股票買賣要毋忘初心！持倉只留強勢股｜潘家榮

中美貿易談判幾經起伏，之前預料中美或提前簽署首階段協議，美方貿易代表更考慮將340億美元對華關稅豁免期限延長；不過最新消息傳來，原定中美元首於11月中智利舉行的亞太經合組織（APEC）峰會上會面，如今峰會取消，令貿易問題又重現不明朗。

之前市場對中美貿易談判樂觀，推動大市造好，不但美股創新高，港股恒生指數亦節節上揚。有讀者就留言問筆者，早前因擔憂跌勢重現而沽貨離場，如今應如何部署？是否可以重新買入？其實這是一個很簡單概念，究竟選擇買進股票的初心是甚麼？當然是認為未來會升才買，那麼又是為何會預期這股票未來會升？
股價走勢最重要
可能會有很多不同的分析：基本面、技術面、各種消息或指標；然而甚麼分析都不是最重要的，最重要就是其股價是否真的上升，並帶來利潤。若然很多因素都看似很好，但股價一直往下跌，那怎樣看也不會是一隻好股票；相反，若然買入後不斷升，那怕其他人說它不好，也是一隻好股票。所以投資者根本不需要太多複雜的理論，說到尾就是看股價走勢，這就是最直接客觀的考慮。
因此，決定沽了不回頭，還是重新買入，倒不如重新問一下自己，假設之前沒有買進過這股票，現時會否想擁有這股票？每一次買賣都是一個獨立的決定，與之前有否曾經買賣是無關的，總不會因為以前賺過錢，現時就算明知處於跌勢都堅持買進；所以是否重新買入，應該是基於認為該股票是否能帶來利潤。
如果之前買完之後，走勢一直上升，一直賺錢，那麼不是應該問沽完甚麼價位買回，反倒是該問問自己，為何要沽出走勢好的股票？是否自己的操作出現了問題？但如果沽出後不斷下跌，或許會覺得可以在更低位買回是著數了；但走勢下滑的情況下，是否仍然為買進的好選擇？如果不是，就不要單單因為感覺著數了而買進走勢轉弱了的股票；反之，如果沽出後股價繼續攀升，走勢上亦仍然強勢，那麼又為何不可以重新買進？每一次買賣都應該獨立考慮，跟之前有否買入或沽出完全無關，反而需要想的是有沒有設止蝕位，不要貪勝不知輸。
持倉只留強勢股
此外，投資者著眼的亦不只是單一個股，更應該是留意整個持倉，筆者一向強調要持倉走勢最好的強勢股。如果已經滿倉了，而其中一隻早前轉弱而沽出了的股票現時重拾升勢，那麼又是否需要為博那隻股票的升幅，而沽出現時持倉中更強的股票？
當明白了箇中操作的道理，就不用總是左右盤算太多。現時指數走勢偏向窄幅上落，不少投資者見升幅受制於250天線，開始擔心會否見頂；但其實指數仍然只是在近期高位徘徊，即使稍作回調亦是正常。況且不少強勢股仍然不斷破頂，市況差極有限，所以與其自己嚇自己，倒不如定好止蝕位，跌穿便走，不跌穿便繼續坐，在控制好向下風險的情況下，繼續坐大浪。

Stock trading should be forgotten! Position only retains strong stocks | Pan Jiarong
04 Nov 2019, 18:38 by Investment
Sino-US trade negotiations have experienced ups and downs. It is expected that China and the United States will sign the first phase agreement in advance, and the US trade representative will consider extending the $34 billion tariff exemption period for China. However, the latest news came that the original US dollar was first in mid-November in Chile. The meeting was held at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, and the cancellation of the summit now makes the trade issue unresolved.

Before the market was optimistic about Sino-US trade negotiations and promoted the market, not only did US stocks hit new highs, but the Hong Kong stocks Hang Seng Index also rose. Some readers have asked the author for the message. They have already left the market because they are worried about the recurrence of the decline. How should they be deployed now? Can I re-buy? In fact, this is a very simple concept. What is the initial intention of choosing to buy stocks? Of course, I think that I will buy in the future, so why would I expect this stock to rise in the future?
Stock price movement is the most important
There may be many different analyses: fundamentals, technical aspects, various messages or indicators; however, what analysis is not the most important, the most important is whether its stock price really rises and brings profits. If many factors seem to be good, but the stock price has been falling, then it will not be a good stock. On the contrary, if it continues to rise after buying, even if others say it is not good, it is also a good stock. . Therefore, investors do not need too much complicated theory at all. When it comes to the end, it is to look at stock price movements. This is the most direct and objective consideration.
Therefore, if you decide not to look back or re-buy, it is better to ask yourself again. If you have not bought this stock before, do you want to own this stock now? Every sale is an independent decision. It has nothing to do with whether it has been traded before. It will not be earned because it has been earned before. Now, even if it knows that it is in a downtrend, it insists on buying; so whether to re-buy should be based on Whether the stock can bring profits.
If the trend has been rising since the end of the purchase, and always make money, then you should not ask what price to buy back, but instead ask yourself, why should you take out the stocks with good trend? Is there a problem with your own operation? However, if you continue to fall after the exit, you may feel that you can buy back at a lower position. However, if the trend declines, is it still a good choice for buying? If not, don't buy stocks that have weakened because you feel the number. On the other hand, if the stock price continues to climb after the sell-off, the trend is still strong, so why not buy it again? Every sale should be considered independently. It has nothing to do with whether it has been bought or sold before. Instead, it is necessary to think about whether there is a stop-loss position and not to be greedy.
Position only retains strong stocks
In addition, investors are not only looking for a single stock, but should also pay attention to the entire position. The author has always emphasized the strongest stocks with the best positions. If it is already full, and one of the stocks that had weakened earlier and has now regained its upward momentum, then is it necessary to increase the stock of Bona and to have a stronger stock in the position?
When you understand the truth of the operation, you don't have to count too much. At present, the index is biased towards a narrow range. Many investors see that the increase is subject to 250 antennas. They are beginning to worry about whether they will peak. However, the index is still only at the recent high level. Even a slight correction is normal. Moreover, many strong stocks are still continually breaking, and the market conditions are extremely limited. Therefore, it is better to scare yourself than to scare yourself. If you fall below, you will continue to sit down. If you do not fall below, you will continue to sit down. Continue to sit on the big waves.
