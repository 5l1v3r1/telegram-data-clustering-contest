      <h1>Family treats Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli as trekkers and not as famous personalities; actress shares the experience!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T18:01:31+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 18:01</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anushka-Sharma">Anushka Sharma</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> have been giving us major couple goals for a long time now. The duo shares pictures and videos of them having a good time together on their respective social media handles.</p>
      <p>And today, Anushka took to her <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Instagram">Instagram</a> to share an experience which she had during her recent trek with her hubby Virat. The actress uploaded a picture of them posing with a family in their sweet home. In her long caption, she revealed what exactly happened during her trek. She wrote that a family offered a cup of tea to both of them as they looked tired after a long trek. Anushka also added that the family had no idea that she is an actress and Virat is Indian cricket team's captain. It read, "Today , during our 8.5 km uphill trek we stopped by a small village on a mountain to pet and feed a baby calf who was born just 4 months ago . While we did that the owner of the house asked us if we were tired and wanted to have a cup of tea ? So we went in to the home of this beautiful and warm family who had absolutely no idea who we were and yet they treated us with such warmth and love . We spent some time with them chatting and drinking tea and the whole time they just know us as two tired trekkers !</p>
      <p>Whoever knows virat and me very closely, know that both of us live for such moments of genuine , simple &amp; pure human connection . It fills us with such joy and peace knowing that they just wanted to be kind to two random foreigners ( plus our guide ) without seeking anything in return. If this is not the true meaning of life then i dont know what is . A memory we will cherish forever üôèüíú‚ú®"</p>
