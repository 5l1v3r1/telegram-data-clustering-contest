      <p>A tribesman in the Amazon has been killed by illegal loggers in what is believed to have been an ambush.</p>
      <p>Paulo Paulino Guajajara, an indigenous leader of the Guajarara tribe and part of a group known as the 'Forest Guardians', was shot in the neck.</p>
      <p>The 'Forest Guardians' were formed by indigenous people to fight off gangs of illegal loggers who are pillaging their rainforest.</p>
      <p>Another tribesman and guardian, Laercio Guajajara, was injured by a bullet to the back in the ambush in the northeastern Brazilian state of Maranhao on Friday.</p>
      <p>Nonprofit pro-indigenous organisation Survival International said he was able to escape. He was hospitalised.</p>
      <p>A logger has also been reported missing.</p>

      <p>The Human Rights Secretary of Maranhao reports the two tribesmen left their village to find water when five armed men began shooting at them immediately.</p>
      <p>Sergio Moro, who is Brazilian Minister of Justice and Public Security, declared this incident a "terrible crime."</p>
      <p>In a tweet, Moro said: "We will spare no effort to bring those responsible for this serious crime to justice."</p>

      <p>An investigation was understood to have been launched by Brazilian Federal Police.</p>
      <p>The Guajarara tribe has tasked itself with protecting the rainforest but this often places them in danger from dangerous criminals.</p>
      <p>A number of Guardians have been killed in recent years Maranhao.</p>

      <p>This latest attack was in the Araribóia indigenous territory in Maranhao. It is a reserve which is home to around 5,300 Guajajara and Awá tribespeople. The Awá is known as the world's most endangered tribe.</p>
      <p>Gilderlan Rodrigues, Maranhão regional coordinator of Brazil’s indigenous missionary council, told the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/02/brazilian-forest-guardian-killed-by-illegal-loggers-in-ambush">Guardian</a> newspaper the tribesmen had been threatened many times before.</p>
      <p>He said: “Their work bothers those that want to loot their territory. These criminal actions must be combated so that more lives are not lost.”</p>
      <p>Survival International's Sarah Shenker said the reserve was an “island of green amid a sea of deforestation”.</p>
      <p>Murdered Paulo Paulino Guajajara was quoted by survival international earlier this year as saying: "It makes me so mad to see this.</p>
      <p>"These people think they can come here, into our home, and help themselves to our forest?</p>

      <p>"No. We won’t allow it. We don’t break into their houses and rob them, do we? My blood is boiling. I’m so angry.”</p>
      <p>Many killings related to the targeting of the reserve by the illegal logging gangs go unsolved.</p>
      <p>Some observers link an increase in the killings and attacks to the presidency of right-wing Jair Bolsonaro, who has made cuts to environmental and indigenous protection agencies.</p>
      <p>Indigenous leader Sonia Bone Guajajara said: “The indigenous genocide of Brazil is legitimised by the discourse of the president."</p>
      <p>Armed land-grabbers, known as grileiros – emboldened by Brazil’s new far-right president Jair Bolsonaro – are responsible for many of the blazes, burning thousands of acres of forest to make room for cattle and crops.</p>
      <p>Bolsonaro supports landowners over indigenous people, who he has compared to animals trapped in the zoo. He has threatened to revoke the protected status of tribal reserves.</p>

      <p>The protection of indigenous land is guaranteed by the Brazilian constitution to preserve 305 tribes, who have been persecuted for centuries.</p>
      <p>Any lessening of rights for the tribes poses a dire threat to both them and the Amazon.</p>
      <p>Along with the fires, the forest is being cut down by cattle ranchers, farmers and mining companies.</p>
      <p>Bolsonaro’s stance has emboldened the grileiros, and violence has surged since his 2018 election.</p>
