Wolverhampton Wanderers are being linked with Huddersfield Town hotshot Karlan Grant ahead of the January transfer window.
The 22-year-old striker has already scored nine goals this season, including the winner in Huddersfield’s 1-0 victory over Brentford on Saturday.
According to the Sun, Wolves are keeping close tabs on his performances ahead of a potential approach when the window re-opens.
Grant cost Huddersfield just £2m when he joined from Charlton Athletic at the start of the year, but it is reported the Terriers will hold out for at least £10m should Wolves make their move.
