      <p>Last month, we decided we’d had enough of the prevalence of flashy, overly edited, out-of-context trailers for stand-up specials and proposed a simple solution using Anthony Jeselnik’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/anthony-jeselnik-fire-in-the-maternity-ward-netflix-special-joke.html"><i>Fire in the Maternity Ward </i>trailer</a> as an example: Going forward, trailers for stand-up specials <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/stand-up-special-trailers-should-just-be-one-great-joke.html">should just be one good joke</a>. So far, it appears that our request has been heard: Instead of releasing a standard trailer for Seth Meyers’s <i>Lobby Baby, </i>Netflix uploaded a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/seth-meyers-lobby-baby-netflix-special-premiere-date.html">commercial parody for a new toy called “Standup Seth,”</a> and today the streaming network released a trailer for Jeff Garlin’s new special that’s just one unedited, 25-second joke that perfectly encapsulates his perspective as a longtime comedian and actor most widely known for <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/11/jeff-garlin-explains-how-curb-your-enthusiasm-scripts-work.html">his work on <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i></a>: “I am immensely successful, but yet — you’d be think it’d be good enough being me — every single day, numerous people come up to me, and they say, ‘What’s Larry David really like?’”</p>
      <p>Garlin’s special, <i>Our Man in Chicago,</i> was filmed in his hometown on the 37th anniversary (to the day!) of his comedy debut. A mix of storytelling and improv, the special debuts next week on Tuesday, November 12.</p>
