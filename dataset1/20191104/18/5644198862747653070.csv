BANGKOK: Talks are still underway with Goldman Sachs on the amount of compensation to be paid over the 1MDB scandal, with Malaysia prepared to take the matter to court, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Monday (Nov 4).

Goldman's role has been under scrutiny as it helped arrange bond issues worth billions for 1MDB, with Malaysia claiming large amounts were misappropriated in the process and seeking US$7.5 billion in redress.
“They’ve caused us to lose about US$7 billion. They may not want to pay us that amount. Their (compensation) offer is too low, because of that we have not accepted their offer,” Dr Mahathir told Malaysian media.
“But how much we’re willing to accept, of course, it’s based on the negotiation, out of court negotiation. But if we cannot reach an agreement, we’ve to go to court.""

""We are not satisfied with that amount so we are still talking to them ... If they respond reasonably we might not insist on getting that US$7.5 billion.""
