MADISON, Wis. - Two people were arrested following a fight at a downtown Madison bar early Monday, police said. 
The Madison Police Department said officers responded at 12:30 a.m. to a report of multiple people fighting during a birthday party at the Echo Tap on West Main Street.
Bar staff told police that glasses were thrown and broken, and bar stools were overturned during the fight between several women on the second floor. A couple of women were punching, kicking and pulling each other's hair.
Officers found broken glass and hair on the floor, and some women were still yelling loudly, the report said.
Beatrice J. Rogers, 22, of Stoughton, was arrested on suspicion of battery, disorderly conduct and resisting or obstructing police. Nekeisha N. Jackson, 25, of Madison, was arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct.
Other people possibly involved in the fight had left before officers arrived, according to the report.
Police said officers are reviewing bar surveillance video of the fight, and more people could face tentative charges.
