04 Nov 2019, 18:52 by Alyssa Bailey
Selena Gomez hit a major milestone today: For the first time ever in her career, Gomez has the #1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Gomez's intimate breakup ballad, ""Lose You to Love Me,"" got the honor last week, during its first full week of streaming. It is also #1 on the Rolling Stone 100. Gomez commented on a fan's post in disbelief of the double-chart news. ""Wait is that real?! Lol,"" she wrote. Yes, it's real.



Instagram


Gomez posted four Instagram Stories marking the Hot 100 achievement and showcasing her sheer shock. ""WHAT?! Omg!! Thank you so much @billboardcharts for a first for me. I'm so grateful!"" she wrote on her first Instagram Story, a repost of the article screenshot song co-writer Julia Michaels shared.

""Thank you guys for streaming and committing to this song!"" Gomez continued in a second Instagram Story. ""It means the world to me! This song has my whole heart.""



Instagram


In a third Instagram Story, Gomez just posted a screenshot of the headline with blue heart emojis and a crying face emoji. Her fourth Instagram Story was her cousin's students congratulating her on the honor.



Instagram





And her fifth was a thank you to her co-writers Michaels and Justin Tranter. ""My soulmates who changed my life since Good For You came out! I love you SO much!! Thank you!!""



Instagram


Gomez also shared a grid post where she wrote her extended thoughts about the honor. ""My first number 1!! This song is so dear to my heart,"" she captioned a shot celebrating the single's achievement. ""I’ve been working so hard to make this album as honest and fun as possible while remaining vulnerable enough to share where I am in life. I love you deeply and thank you so much for listening. I want to thank each and every person that was apart of this moment that I’ll never forget!""
