When you drive on the road from Muscat to Sohar, don’t forget to keep your eyes on the road as the stunning architecture of Sohar’s Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque might make it a tad difficult. Inaugurated in October 2016 by Sayyid Mohammed bin Sultan bin Hamood Al Busaidi, the Minister of State and Governor of Dhofar, the mosque’s blue dome and off-white marble structure make it a sight that is truly lovely to behold. The mosque covers a total area of 181,000 square metres and features a built up area of 28,778 square metres, with the area allocated to the mosque also accommodating the landscaping, car parks and other facilities.The main prayer hall of the mosque accommodates 4,600 worshippers. It also has a prayer area for 740 women. The mosque is located opposite Bait Bahjat Al Andhar in the Wilayat of Sohar, and represents a new landmark added to the deep-rooted historic landmarks in the Governorate of Al Batinah.



At the time of its construction, the mosque brought the total number of places of worship named after His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said across all of Oman’s governorates to 32. On the occasion of the inauguration, Sayyid Mohammed bin Sultan bin Hamood Al Busaidi, the Minister of State and Governor of Dhofar performed Friday prayers, led by Mohammed bin Salim Al Maqbali, an imam and preacher of the mosque. In comparison to the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque in Sohar, the total area of the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque in Bowsher which was opened in 2001 is 416,000 square metres and features a built-up area of some 40,000 square metres. In addition, the Sultan Qaboos Mosque in Ruwi is one of the first mosques to be built in his honour. It was built in 1978 per the Royal Directives of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said. This was followed by the construction of the Fort Mosque in the Wilayat of Nizwa of Al Dakhiliya Governorate which opened in 1980.
