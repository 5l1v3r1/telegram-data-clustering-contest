Ex-MP wants five officers to face criminal inquiry over alleged paedophile ring case

The former Tory MP Harvey Proctor who was falsely accused of being part of a VIP paedophile ring in Westminster is calling for five police officers who worked on Scotland Yard’s inquiry to face a criminal investigation.
Proctor spoke out after a damning report last month laid bare a series of failings in the £2.5m Metropolitan police investigation into the allegations. The report revealed officers unlawfully obtained warrants to search the homes of Proctor and other falsely accused men.
The ex-politician has submitted a criminal complaint about five officers involved in the inquiry into the claims of Carl Beech – known as “Nick” when he first came forward in 2014 – who was jailed for 18 years in July over the false allegations.
Proctor wants the officers to be investigated and interviewed under caution. They include Steve Rodhouse, who was a deputy assistant commissioner and the gold commander of the investigation and is now the deputy director general of the National Crime Agency, Britain’s version of the FBI. The other four, who have all retired from the Met, are Kenny McDonald, Eric Sword, Alison Hepworth and Diane Tudway.
The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) watchdog earlier cleared officers involved in Operation Midland of wrongdoing, but Proctor is accusing the five of perverting the course of justice and misconduct in public office.
The 72-year-old told a press conference in Westminster that he had made a formal complaint about the five officers. “It is unprecedented that two senior and respected judges should publicly allege criminality in the conduct of a police investigation,” he said.
“I waited for the MPS [Metropolitan Police Service] and the IOPC to take the necessary action to trigger a full police investigation into this alleged criminality. In the absence of such action and investigation, after the fullest and most careful consideration, having taken legal advice, and with the deepest regret, I am compelled, in the interest of justice, to report these matters as crimes to Northumbria police.”
The force, he said, should not limit its investigation to the five officers and should “go where the evidence takes them”.



Sir Richard Henriques, the retired high court judge who carried out a review of Operation Midland, last month called for a criminal investigation, saying: “The course of justice was perverted with shocking consequences.”
His report revealed that warrants to search the homes of wrongly accused suspects were obtained “unlawfully” and “should not have taken place”.
It said police “misled” the district judge who authorised the search by describing Beech’s allegations as “consistent” and “credible”. The district judge Howard Riddle, who granted the search warrants, agreed with Henriques’s finding. “The conclusion is that the search warrants were obtained unlawfully,” Riddle said last month.
Northumbria police confirmed they had received Proctor’s complaint, which he delivered in person last month, and had referred it to the Metropolitan police. Scotland Yard said it was assessing the complaint, adding: “We can confirm that the MPS received a referral from Northumbria police on Thursday 31 October 2019 following a complaint comprising criminal allegations in relation to five former MPS officers involved in Operation Midland.”
Last month, the Met published an unredacted version of Henriques’s scathing review of Operation Midland which listed a series of police failings and prompted calls for the commissioner, Cressida Dick, to consider her position.
Henriques revealed that senior officers agreed to publicly say they believed Beech, leading a detective to infamously declare that his claims were “credible and true”. The premeditated decision by officers to publicly say they believed Beech was a “serious mistake”, Henriques said.
The unredacted report also shed light on the role of Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who, according to Henriques, pressurised investigating officers. Reviewing how to engage with the politician was listed among “investigative priorities” by a senior officer.
Beech, a former nurse, alleged he was among the victims of an “establishment group” – including politicians and military figures – who kidnapped, raped and murdered boys in the 1970s and 1980s. He accused Proctor, the former prime minister Edward Heath, the ex-home secretary Leon Brittan and the D-day veteran Field Marshal Edwin Bramall of being abusers.
