彭博：習近平對赴美簽協議持開放態度

04 Nov 2019, 18:11

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】智利宣布取消主辦APEC峰會後，美中兩國首腦將在何處簽署首階段貿易協議頓成懸疑。彭博社日前引述知情人士稱，中國國家主席習近平對赴美持開放態度。週一，中共外交部發言人在記者會上被問及「川習會」可能的地點時卻未給予正面回答，僅稱兩位領導人一直保持聯繫。
自從美中官方對外證實雙方即將達成第一階段協議後，多方消息均顯示美中元首很可能會於本月中旬在智利出席亞太經濟合作組織（APEC）峰會期間簽署這份階段性協議。但智利因國內發生抗議活動而與10月30日宣布取消主辦APEC峰會，川普與習近平將在何處簽署協議的問題便成為各國媒體關注的一個焦點。
彭博社11月4日的一篇報道稱，習近平對訪美簽署協議持開放態度。該報導援引一名知情人士透露說，中方希望，如果習近平前往美國簽署第一階段貿易協議，將是其國事訪問的一部分；但即使不是國事規格的訪問，中方也對習近平訪美持開放態度。
在中共外交部週一舉行的例行新聞發佈會上，有媒體記者提出了習近平與川普有可能在何時何地會面的問題。發言人耿爽沒有正面回答這個問題，僅稱「兩位領導人一直通過各種渠道保持着聯繫」。
同一天，第35屆東盟峰會以及相關會議正在泰國曼谷舉行。中共國務院總理李克強在曼谷會見了包括美國國家安全顧問羅伯特•奧布萊恩（Robert C. O』Brien）和美國商務部長威爾伯•羅斯（Wilbur Ross）在內的美國代表團。
當天，奧布萊恩對媒體表示，美中兩國政府已「相當接近完成」第一階段的貿易協議，如果雙方首腦準備前述這份協議，川普總統將邀請習近平訪美。
羅斯也表示，美國在與中國達成「第一階段」貿易協議方面已經取得很大進展，但他同時強調，協議的執行機制十分重要，而目前華府正在致力於確保協議雙方都對各自同意的事宜有「非常正確、清楚和詳細的了解」。
此前一天（11月3日），川普在白宮南草坪上被媒體追問何時何地可能與中方簽署協議的問題時回應稱，美中貿易談判有進展，但是否會達成這份協議還需要再看看。他說：「如果我們達成協議，會議地點將會很容易選擇，將會是在美國的某個地方。」
路透社則報導稱，美中談判人員正加緊敲定「第一階段」貿易協定，以便供習近平和川普在本月簽署，目前美方要求中方提出採購美國農產品時間表的問題尚未解決。
