      <h1>Pump prices cut slightly this week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T18:09:16+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 18:09</time> by <a rel="author">Myrna M. Velasco</a></address>
      <p>Prices at the pumps had been down slightly this week – at the scale of ₱0.25 per liter for diesel; and ₱0.10 per liter for both gasoline and kerosene products.</p>
      <p>Among the major oil companies, it had been Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation that started this fresh round of rollback effective on Tuesday (November 5) at 6 a.m.; and it was followed by Phoenix Petroleum, PetroGazz, Seaoil and PTT Philippines with parallel cost reductions and the same implementation timeframe. The rest of industry competitors are expected to follow.</p>
      <p>With more steady swing in global prices, Filipino consumers are also getting a break on their pockets – which proves very helpful given the string of spending that they need to look forward to for the Christmas season.</p>
      <p>Even the foreign exchange rate, which is another factor that could exert pressure on oil prices, had been turning favorable the past weeks – with the Philippine peso gaining value against the US dollar.</p>
