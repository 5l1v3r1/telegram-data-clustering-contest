中共恐嚇東盟挨批 華為欲挾東南亞抗美圍堵

04 Nov 2019, 18:43

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】第35屆東盟峰會及東亞峰會週一在泰國曼谷閉幕。白宮國家安全顧問在會上批評，北京威嚇阻止東盟國家開發南海資源。華為公司則在峰會上稱為在東南亞鋪設5G做好準備，被指意圖對抗美國圍堵。
美國今年出席東盟峰會的人員降格，總統川普（特朗普）和副總統彭斯都沒有到場，而是由白宮國家安全顧問奧布萊恩擔任特使出席。
在會上，奧布萊恩宣讀了川普的聲明，重申美國對印太地區的承諾。聲明說，東盟發布的「東盟印太展望」與美國對東盟的期待一致，雙方都尊重主權、承諾良好的政府治理和遵從國際法。川普也邀請東盟領袖們明年首季到美國參加特別峰會。
奧布萊恩在演講中還提到南海議題。他說，在南海區域，北京用威嚇的方式阻止東盟國家開發離岸海洋資源，這樣的策略違反了尊重、公平和國際法等原則。他表示，東盟地區對「新帝國時代」沒有興趣，也對大國能掌控他國的「強權即是公理」這種理論沒興趣。
當天，美國商務部長羅斯也在美國商會和美國東協商會共同舉辦的印太商務論壇表示，美國是向印太地區直接投資最多的國家，比中共還多，而且美國對印太有長遠且堅定的承諾，尊重他國主權、支持和平解決爭端、尊重國際法、支持航行和飛行自由。
與此同時，中共在東盟峰會上繼續強調與東盟深化關係，顯示出美中在印太地區繼續博弈。中國華為公司也在東盟峰會上展開公關，意圖繼續進軍東盟市場，來突破美國封堵。
出席峰會的華為全球公共事務副總裁周明成周日表示，中美正在進行貿易戰，同時也有一場科技戰。他說，華為願協助東盟國家實施所謂「第四次工業革命」，並已做好在東南亞地區「全面鋪設5G基礎設施」的準備。
華盛頓智庫戰略與國際問題研究中心（CSIS）今年2月的報告指，中共在東南亞推行「數字絲綢之路」具有一定戰略優勢，值得美國和地區盟友警覺。
2016年到2018年間，華為在東南亞獲得總採購額為20.9億美元。今年2月初，泰國啟動了華為5G測試平台。6月，菲律賓最大的電信運營商環球電信，也使用華為技術開啟了5G寬頻服務。不過，越南將華為拒之門外，採用愛立信和諾基亞的技術。
隨着美國封堵，華為在最大的歐洲和北美市場遇挫，但仍在加緊開發中東和非洲市場。

The CCP threatens to appraise the ASEAN

04 Nov 2019, 18:43

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] The 35th ASEAN Summit and the East Asia Summit closed on Monday in Bangkok, Thailand. The White House National Security Adviser criticized at the meeting that Beijing threatened to prevent ASEAN countries from developing resources in the South China Sea. At the summit, Huawei said that it was preparing to lay 5G in Southeast Asia and was accused of fighting against the US.
The US personnel who attended the ASEAN summit this year were downgraded. President Trump (Trump) and Vice President Burns were not present, but the White House National Security Adviser O'Brien was the special envoy.
At the meeting, O'Brien read Trump's statement and reiterated the US commitment to the Indo-Pacific region. The statement said that the ""ASEAN Indo-Vision"" issued by ASEAN is in line with the expectations of the United States for ASEAN. Both sides respect sovereignty, good government governance and compliance with international law. Trump also invited ASEAN leaders to attend the special summit in the United States in the first quarter of next year.
O'Brien also mentioned the South China Sea issue in his speech. He said that in the South China Sea region, Beijing used intimidation to prevent ASEAN countries from developing offshore marine resources. Such a strategy violates the principles of respect, fairness and international law. He said that the ASEAN region has no interest in the ""new empire era"" and is not interested in the theory that the big powers can control other countries' ""power is justice"".
On the same day, US Commerce Secretary Ross also held the Indo-Pacific Business Forum jointly organized by the American Chamber of Commerce and the US East Consultation. The United States is the country with the most direct investment in the Indo-Pacific region, more than the CCP, and the United States has a long-term and firm commitment to India. Commitment to respect the sovereignty of other countries, support the peaceful settlement of disputes, respect international law, support navigation and freedom of flight.
At the same time, the CCP continued to emphasize deepening relations with ASEAN at the ASEAN summit, showing that the United States and China continue to play in the Indo-Pacific region. China Huawei also launched public relations at the ASEAN summit, intending to continue to enter the ASEAN market to break through the US blockade.
Zhou Mingcheng, Huawei’s vice president of global public affairs, attended the summit on Sunday. He said that China and the United States are engaged in a trade war and there is also a scientific war. He said that Huawei is willing to assist ASEAN countries in implementing the so-called ""fourth industrial revolution"" and is ready to ""completely lay 5G infrastructure"" in Southeast Asia.
The Washington Think Tank Strategy and International Studies Center (CSIS) reported in February that the CCP’s implementation of the “Digital Silk Road” in Southeast Asia has certain strategic advantages and deserves the vigilance of US and regional allies.
From 2016 to 2018, Huawei received a total purchase of US$2.09 billion in Southeast Asia. In early February of this year, Thailand launched the Huawei 5G test platform. In June, Global Telecom, the largest telecom operator in the Philippines, also used Huawei technology to open 5G broadband services. However, Vietnam has rejected Huawei and adopted the technology of Ericsson and Nokia.
With the US blockade, Huawei has suffered setbacks in the largest European and North American markets, but is still stepping up its development in the Middle East and Africa.
