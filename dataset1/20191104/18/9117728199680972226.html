        <b>Renault team boss Cyril Abiteboul left the Circuit of the Americas in a good mood after his Renault team secured their second double points finish in a row. Daniel Ricciardo drove superbly to P6, whilst Nico Hulkenberg earned P9.</b>
      </p>
      <p>However, the fightback may have come a little too late as McLaren are 38 points ahead in the constructors' standings with just two races left to go.</p>

      <p>Abiteboul said following the weekend:Â <i>"We have to first acknowledge it was once again a great race in our pack with very open and exciting strategic options for all. I think our drivers, and the team, enjoyed the race.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"Daniel made an excellent start and was one of the few drivers who managed to make a one-stop strategy work. When Norris stopped, we decided to be aggressive and not stop to try to beat both McLarens, which worked.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"On Nico's side, the strategy set before the race was also a one-stop, but we managed to switch it on time and Nico kept his head down when he slipped in the leaderboard. He was then able to regain positions on Soft tyres at the end thanks to clever fuel management at the beginning of the race."</i>
