      <p>LONDON: Manchester City captain David Silva looks set to miss the top of the table clash with leaders Liverpool on Sunday (Nov 3) due to injury, said City manager Pep Guardiola.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old Spanish attacking midfielder in his last season with the club suffered a muscular injury towards the end of the first-half of Saturday's 2-1 win over Southampton.</p>

      <p>Guardiola, whose side trail Liverpool by six points in the table, disclosed no more about the nature of the injury but it normally entails an absence of just under two weeks.</p>
      <p>"David Silva was injured," said Guardiola. "Five minutes before the first half ended he told me he had a muscular problem.</p>
      <p>"When he has a muscular problem and cannot play more minutes it is because he has something and when it is a muscular problem it is always a minimum of 10-12 days."</p>
      <p>Guardiola, whose side also faces a Champions League clash with Italian outfit Atalanta on Wednesday, admitted Liverpool's home record of not having lost at Anfield since January 2017 was a daunting prospect.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have also not been beaten in the league since their loss at the Etihad last January and have dropped just two points this term - a 1-1 draw with City's neighbours Manchester United.</p>
      <p>"How many centuries and they don't lose at Anfield? We will see," he joked.</p>
      <p>"Now we go to Italy and when we come back we go to Anfield. Many things are going to happen and there are a lot of games to play," he added, , denying the match would be pivotal as to who wins the title</p>
      <p>Guardiola also ruled out taking Atalanta for granted and putting out a second string team for the game at the San Siro.</p>
      <p>Victory would secure City a place in the knockout stages.</p>
      <p>"Do you think we can prioritise four titles in one season if we prioritise games?" said Guardiola.</p>
      <p>"We're going to play with the best team possible to win at Atalanta and after we go to Anfield.</p>
      <p>"The best way to go to Anfield is to play a good game against Atalanta, who have been fighting with the top clubs in Italy for the last two or three seasons."</p>
