      <p>Faze Jarvis, a YouTuber with nearly 2 million subscribers, has been permanently banned from playing <i>Fortnite</i> after uploading videos where he uses cheating software to kill enemies. Known as “aimbots,” Jarvis used the accuracy modifications to gain advantage in non-competitive modes, such solos.</p>
      <p>The now-deleted footage that seems to have gotten Jarvis in trouble shows him never missing a shot, all while admitting he’s using cheats to do so.</p>

      <p>In an video where he announces his ban from the game, Jarvis seems emotional, as he recounts that his professional career is tied to the battle royale game.</p>

      <p>“I wouldn’t be here without this game,” he says.</p>
      <p>“All I was thinking about as I was making those videos was just how entertaining and interesting these videos would be for you guys to watch,” he continues. “It didn’t even cross my mind to think that I could be banned for life from <i>Fortnite.</i>”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/eula">The <i>Fortnite</i> terms of service note</a> that the game forbids the use of “cheats, bots, scripts, or mods not expressly authorized by Epic,” especially anything that may give “you and/or another user an advantage over other players who do not use such methods.”</p>
      <p>While some believe this is a cut and dry situation, others, like popular YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSDb2boEtUE">The Fortnite Guy, are calling it unfair.</a> The argument against this decision is that it seems absurd that a player using cheats in a non-competitive context would get a lifetime ban, while professional players who cheated in an actual tournament <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/3/18528254/fortnite-xxif-cheating-teaming-world-cup">only got a temporary ban</a> — and then were later <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/27/8933177/xxif-cheating-fortnite-world-cup-booed-cheered-duos">allowed to play during the World Cup.</a></p>
      <p>An Epic Games spokesperson reiterated to Polygon that Jarvis broke the rules.</p>
      <p>“We have a zero tolerance policy for the usage of cheat software,” Epic says. “When people use aimbots or other cheat technologies to gain an unfair advantage, they ruin games for people who are playing fairly.”</p>
      <p>It seems that the cheating method made a difference in Epic’s decision. The professional players temporarily banned earlier this year teamed up and made an agreement, whereas aimbots are something that anyone could theoretically look up and buy, making them more pervasive. Cheating software also directly tampers with how the game works.</p>
      <p>Faze Clan did not respond before publication.</p>
      <p>“Obviously this is a huge mistake and it’s completely wrong on my end,” Jarvis says in the YouTube video. “Genuinely I don’t even know what I was thinking, cheating in anything is just terrible,” he continued.</p>
      <p>“I should have paid more attention to the community rules.”</p>
