      <h1>Tottenham appeal Son Heung-min red card and offer counselling over Andre Gomes injury</h1>
      <h2>Tottenham star Son Heung-min was left devastated after his tackle caused a serious injury to Everton's Andre Gomes on Sunday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T18:23:26+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 18:23</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham have launched an appeal against Son Heung-min's red card for the tackle which led to Andre Gomes' horrific injury.</p>
      <p>Gomes suffered a fracture dislocation of his left ankle with the graphic nature of the injury leaving Son in tears.</p>
      <p>He is understood to have been offered counselling by Spurs chiefs as he remains upset over the incident as the club launch an official appeal against the decision to show him a red card.</p>
      <p>The innocuous tackle as Gomes looked to attack saw him awkwardly fall into Sergie Aurier, leaving him on the turf screaming in agony.</p>
      <p>Referee Martin Atkinson initially reached for a yellow card but, once he realised the outcome of the challenge, brandished a red with Son inconsolable as he was led off the pitch.</p>

      <p>A Premier League statement explaining the controversial decision said: "The red card for Son was for endangering the safety of a player which happened as a consequence of his initial challenge."</p>
      <p>They have now launched an appeal, knowing they could be without Son for upcoming Premier League games against Sheffield United, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> if it is unsuccessful.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> skipper Sheamus Coleman visited Son in the dressing room after the game to offer words of support, whilst team-mate Dele Alli, who opened the scoring in the 1-1 draw, gave his reaction to the incident to Sky Sports after the match.</p>

      <p>"Didn’t want to look too much at what happened. I want to send best wishes," Alli said.</p>
      <p>"Son is devastated and in tears. It’s not his fault. Son is one of nicest people you’ve ever met. He can’t even lift his head up, he’s crying so much.</p>
      <p>"The injury does play on your mind but you have to stay professional.</p>
      <p>"We switched off for a second and they scored."</p>
