Facebook would like to be addressed henceforth as FACEBOOK. NBC News:
Facebook introduced a new brand Monday: FACEBOOK. The company announced in a blog post that the new brand, which retains the name of the social network, would have a new logo to better indicate all the various products and services it now offers, including Instagram and WhatsApp.
If you'll recall, this is what Milo Yiannopoulos did as an immediate prelude to everything going horribly wrong for him.
