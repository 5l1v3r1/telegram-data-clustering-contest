      <p><b>LONDON: </b>A British musician who launched a public appeal after leaving his 310-year-old violin on a train was reunited with the undamaged instrument in a secretive meeting in a supermarket carpark.</p>
      <p>Police told on Monday there would be no further action taken against the man who returned the violin, which is reportedly worth around £250,000 ($320,000).</p>
      <p>“My violin is home safe and sound! Thanks for the overwhelming support,” the musician, Stephen Norris, tweeted at the weekend.</p>

      <p>British Transport Police issued an image of the man believed to have taken it, and Morris received a message on social media from someone claiming to have information.</p>
      <p>According to the <i>BBC</i>, the man called himself “Gene” and arranged to meet Morris in a supermarket car park on Friday evening, where he handed over the violin in a bag.</p>
      <p>“He was very apologetic, he said he wanted to hand it to me in person,” the musician said, adding that the violin and bows were intact.</p>
      <p>A British Transport Police spokesperson told<i> AFP</i> the violin had been returned, and said no further action was being taken against the man who had it.</p>
