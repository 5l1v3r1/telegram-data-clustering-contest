      <h1>El Al airlines 'draws' Boeing 747 outline over Mediterranean Sea in honor of retiring fleet</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T18:55:45+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 18:55</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Bartiromo</a></address>
      <p>An aircraft with El Al <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/airlines">Isreal Airlines</a> just “drew” what is probably the largest self-portrait ever created.</p>
      <p>El Al, Israel’s national carrier, paid tribute to its soon-to-be-retired fleet of Boeing 747s by outlining the shape of the popular plane in the sky over the Mediterranean, as seen in a diagram of its flight path.</p>

      <p>The Nov. 3 flight, which departed from Rome and landed in Tel Aviv, diverted just west of Cyprus and lowered its cruising altitude by 10,000 feet before starting its plane-shaped flight path, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/el-al-tribute-retiring-boeing-747-drawing-plane-in-sky-2019-11">Business Insider</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The outline itself appears nearly as wide as the island of Cyprus; a legend provided at <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/ly1747#22b566bf">FlightAware24</a> indicates it measured over 100 miles long.</p>

      <p>The stunt also took around an hour to perform, as calculated by <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/el-al-last-747-flight/">One Mile at a Time</a>, based on previous Rome-to-Tel-Aviv flights.</p>

      <p>The Nov. 3 flight marked El Al’s final flying of a Boeing 747. El Al is reportedly replacing the planes with Boeing 787 Dreamliners, per the <a href="https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/El-Als-jumbo-fleet-signs-off-in-style-with-aerial-farewell-606716">Jerusalem Post</a>.</p>
