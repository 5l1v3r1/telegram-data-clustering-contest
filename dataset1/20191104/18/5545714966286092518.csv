Contest: Drink your way out of Hell with a PC copy of Afterparty
Puke and rally, folks

Do horrible things to your liver in today's contest to win a PC copy of Afterparty!
Oh, that pesky Satan. He's always doing stuff that's kinda evil, but also kinda tricky. It's like the scales are tipped against you when dealing with him. Quite frankly, I think it's rude. Stop that, Satan.
Give the Devil his due in Afterparty, where you challenge that big red idiot to a drinking contest to win your freedom from Hell. Pretty cool setup, right? We've got some PC copies to give away, so read more to find out how to win!



I drank way too much this weekend, so read something that someone else was sober enough to write.
In Afterparty, players will take on the roles of Lola (voiced by Janina Gavankar) and Milo (voiced by Khoi Dao), recently deceased best buds who suddenly find themselves staring down an eternity in Hell. But there's a loophole: outdrink Satan and he'll grant re-entry to Earth. The narrative-focused game will also feature: An intelligent conversation system that will allow players to change the story and relationships based on every decision An underworld that features an interconnected network of islands via the River Styx A variety of libations (over 30), each changing the player's dialogue choices and personalities A large, outrageous cast to interact with, all with their own unique set of problems Demonic activities including beer pong, dance-offs, and chugging competitions An original soundtrack by scntfc, who scored Oxenfree
I love the word ""libation."" I don't know why.
To enter to win your copy, craft a libation for me. I don't like vodka, so you're going to have to find something else to mix up for me. I'm a thirsty, thirsty boy, so get creative!
We have five PC copies to give away, redeemable from the Epic Games Store. Winners will be drawn Friday, November 8. Please make sure to comment using a Dtoid account with your current email address on file. New users can sign up here to join the bartending frenzy.
Afterparty is available now for PC and other platforms. Head over to PC Invasion for more chances to win!

All U.S., federal, state and local and regulations apply.2.

Winning a prize is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements set forth herein.3. Entry Period: The start and end dates/times of each Contest (the “Entry Period”) will be posted on the applicable Contest site.4. Entry: To enter a Contest, follow the instructions on the Contest site. Submission will result in one (1) entry.

The use of any agencies or automated software to submit entries will void all entries submitted by that person, with the exception of patron members who may enter contests by logging into their 'perks' page.5. Drawing: Unless otherwise specified in the contest details above, we will select the names of the potential winners in a random drawing of all eligible entries received during each Entry Period. The number of winners to be selected in a specific Contest will be posted on the applicable Contest site. The odds of being selected as a potential winner depend on the number of eligible entries received during the Entry Period. Potential winners will be contacted via email and will be asked to provide their full name, age and mailing address within a specified time period. If a potential winner does not respond within the timeframe stated in the notification email, we may select an alternate potential winner in his/her place at random from all entries received during the Entry Period.

The winners are responsible for any taxes and fees associated with receipt or use of a prize. Prizes will be mailed between 1 to 45 business days after winners have replied with their required info.8. General Conditions: In the event that the operation, security, or administration of the Contest is impaired in any way for any reason, including, but not limited to fraud, virus, or other technical problem, the Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, either: (a) suspend the Contest to address the impairment and then resume the Contest in a manner that best conforms to the spirit of these Official Rules; or (b) award the prizes at random from among the eligible entries received up to the time of the impairment. The Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any individual it finds to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Contest or to be acting in violation of these Official Rules or in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to undermine the legitimate operation of the Contest may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, the Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Sponsor’s failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. In case of a dispute as to the owner of an entry, entry will be deemed to have been submitted by the authorized account holder of the screen name from which the entry is made. The authorized account holder is defined as the natural person who is assigned to an e-mail address by an Internet access provider, online service provider, or other organization responsible for assigning e-mail addresses for the domain associated with the submitted e-mail address.9.Release and Limitations of Liability: By participating in the Contest, entrants agree to release and hold harmless the Contest Entities from and against any claim or cause of action arising out of participation in the Contest or receipt or use of any prize, including, but not limited to: (a) unauthorized human intervention in the Contest; (b) technical errors related to computers, servers, providers, or telephone or network lines; © printing errors; (d) lost, late, postage-due, misdirected, or undeliverable mail; (e) errors in the administration of the Contest or the processing of entries; or (f) injury or damage to persons or property which may be caused, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from entrant’s participation in the Contest or receipt of any prize. Entrant further agrees that in any cause of action, the Contest Entities’ liability will be limited to the cost of entering and participating in the Contest, and in no event shall the Contest Entities be liable for attorney’s fees. Entrant waives the right to claim any damages whatsoever, including, but not limited to, punitive, consequential, direct, or indirect damages.10. Disputes: Except where prohibited, entrant agrees that any and all disputes, claims and causes of action arising out of, or connected with, the Contest or any prize awarded shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action. All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of these Official Rules, entrant’s rights and obligations, or the rights and obligations of the Sponsors in connection with the Contest, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules (whether of the Commonwealth of Virginia or any other jurisdiction), which would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the Commonwealth of Virginia.11. Contest Results: To enter the contest without needing to buy/sell anything or request a written copy of the name of the winners, send a self-addressed stamped envelope (stating the specific Contest you are requesting the winners for) to Destructoid.com Contest Winners, 548 Market Street #59757, San Francisco, CA 94104 USA.
