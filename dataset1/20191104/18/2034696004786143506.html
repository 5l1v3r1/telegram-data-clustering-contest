      <p>Taking to Instagram, the director’s images show a number of photos from the set. In amongst them is a picture of the Joker’s notebook.</p>
      <p>On the page shown, we see the image of a woman riding a cat while another has had her head edited off and replaced with a cat’s, which many have taken as a reference to iconic DC character Catwoman.</p>

      <p>The character will next be seen opposite Robert Pattinson in <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/the-movies-blog/the-batman-movie-release-date-plot-cast-robert-pattinson-2559244"><i>The Batman</i></a>, portrayed by <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/zoe-kravitz-cast-catwoman-opposite-robert-pattinson-batman-2557143">Zoe Kravitz</a>, who previously voiced the role in <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/lego-batman-movie-film-review"><i>The Lego Batman Movie</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Following the success of <i>Joker</i>, star Joaquin Phoenix has revealed <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/jokers-joaquin-phoenix-reveals-if-a-sequel-could-be-on-the-cards-2564174">whether he would be involved in a sequel</a>. He said: “I wouldn’t just do a sequel just because the first movie is successful, that’s ridiculous.”</p>
      <p>However, he added: “Long before the release or before we had any idea if it would be successful, we talked about sequels.”</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Phillips previously said a sequel could be a possibility thanks to Phoenix’s performance. “One thing I will tell you: I would do anything with [Phoenix], any day of the week. There’s nobody like him.</p>
      <p>“If he was willing to do [a sequel], and if people show up to this movie, and Warners came to us and said, ‘You know what? If you guys could think of something…’ Well, I have a feeling that he and I could think of something pretty cool,” he said.</p>
