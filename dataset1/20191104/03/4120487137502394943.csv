04 Nov 2019, 03:37

【罗盘新闻网雅加达11月02日讯】佐科威总统称亲自遴选肃贪会（KPK）监督委员会委员。根据2019年第19号法律中关于肃贪会监督委员会委任的规定，总统不必通过评选委员会遴选肃贪会监督委员会委员。但是，来自建设团结党（PPP）党团的国会第三委员会成员阿尔苏尔·萨尼（Arsul Sani）希望佐科威总统遴选挑选没事涉嫌法律问题的人选担任肃贪会监督委员会成员。“根据法律，国会没有权力向总统提议担任肃贪会监督委员会委员的人选。”阿尔苏尔周六（11月日）对记者如是说道。“ 希望佐科威总统选择在执法领域具有权威、诚信和具有政治背景及丰富经验的人，或者至少是优秀的律师。除了执法部门之外，预计佐科威总统还将选择来自学术界的人选。” 阿尔苏尔如是说道。“ 当然，不仅是法律领域的学者，但是公共组织管理，电信和信息专家的学者也可以选择。”阿苏尔说。但是，根据第69条A款第1项规定有关首次由总统任命的监督委员会主席。佐科威总统承认，目前他已收到来自各界推荐担任肃贪会监督委员会委员的名单。监督委员会将与2019 至2023年当选的肃贪会领导人就职典礼相吻合。“ 请相信，被遴选的人将是具有良好信誉的人。”佐科威如是说道。
