People around the world are loving this impressive video of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, wrapping up her political career in two minutes. And everyone is also feeling a hefty dose of envy.

In celebration of two years in office, Prime Minister Ardern decided to note some of her most memorable achievements in a speedy piece to camera. In the video, she details a number of environmental, health, and employment changes she’s implemented during her time in office, and honestly, I get why everyone’s jealous.
The video has gone viral, and it’s easy to see why: it’s damn impressive.
Beyond creating 92,000 jobs and increasing the minimum wage to $17.70, Prime Minister Ardern’s achievements include extending paid parental leave and passing the Child Poverty Reduction Act, which does exactly as it says on the tin. She also boasts the lowest rate of unemployment and the highest increase in wages in a decade.
Yep. No big deal.



The New Zealand PM touches on the environmental impacts of her government in the video too. Through planting 140 million trees, banning single-use plastic bags, and introducing the zero-carbon bill, she has attempted to ensure her impact will last well beyond her time in office.






In Australia, everyone is basically campaigning for Jacinda Ardern to come and replace our garbage leaders.









After seeing just how much she’s done for New Zealand, it’s fair to say everyone else around the globe can take notes.
