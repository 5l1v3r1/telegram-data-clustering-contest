04 Nov 2019, 03:39 by Tan Xue Ying
（吉隆坡4日讯）综合油气服务公司Uzma Bhd上周宣布入禀法庭状告韩国Khan Co Ltd和Kong Offshore Malaysia私人有限公司后，今早一度下挫8.5仙或8.3%，至93.5仙。
截至11时20分，该股报94.5仙，共2222万7700股易手，为主要热门股之一。
Uzma股价从8月的58仙，几乎翻了一番，至10月24日的1.11令吉，为11个月高位，惟上周开始逆转升势。
该集团于10月30日指出，独资子公司就超额支付6314万令吉的工程费用，向Khan和Kong采取法律行动。
Uzma表示，Uzma Engineering私人有限公司（UESB）、Khan和Kong参与了一项名为KNPG-B Topside Ph II, Kinabalu Non-Associated Gas（NAG）发展项目，并引发争议。
然而，一名不愿具名的分析员表示，这起法律诉讼没有问题，因为结果对Uzma是正面或中和。
“这宗法律案件没有问题。该项目归还给了Uzma，而Uzma继续交付项目，费用已经入账。”
分析员向theedgemarkets.com说：“如果Uzma胜诉，将会有一笔资金转回，有利于现金流。即便败诉，对Uzma不会产生影响，因为不需要减值。”

Legal disputes Uzma 8%
04 Nov 2019, 03:39 by Tan Xue Ying
KUALA LUMPUR (April 4): Uzma Bhd, an integrated oil and gas service company, last week announced that it had slammed 8.5 cents or 8.3% to 93.5 cents this morning after accusing the court of suing South Korea’s Khan Co Ltd and Kong Offshore Malaysia Sdn Bhd.
As of 11:20, the stock reported 94.5 sen, a total of 22.2 million 7700 shares changed hands, one of the main hot stocks.
Uzma's share price has almost doubled from 58 cents in August to RM1.11 on October 24, an 11-month high, but last week began to reverse the uptrend.
The group pointed out on October 30 that the wholly-owned subsidiary had taken legal action against Khan and Kong for over-payment of RM63.14 million in engineering costs.
Uzma said Uzma Engineering Pte Ltd (UESB), Khan and Kong participated in a KNPG-B Topside Ph II, Kinabalu Non-Associated Gas (NAG) development project and sparked controversy.
However, an analyst who did not want to be named said that there was no problem with the lawsuit because the result was positive or neutral to Uzma.
“There was no problem with this legal case. The project was returned to Uzma, and Uzma continued to deliver the project, and the cost was already recorded.”
The analyst said to theedgemarkets.com: ""If Uzma wins the case, there will be a return of funds to facilitate cash flow. Even if it loses, it will have no effect on Uzma because there is no need for impairment.""
