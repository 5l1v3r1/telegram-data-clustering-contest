A new week gets off to a busy start as four horse racing meetings take place around the country.
There's plenty of action at Plumpton, Kempton Park, Hereford and Newcastle - and our man Newsboy has scoured the form to bring you the best bets and tips.
With some favourites and a few better value bets, as well as a more ambitious daily double, there is plenty to interest the punters.
We've also got the NAP and Next Best bet on offer - have a look and see what tickles your interest, but please remember to always gamble responsibly.

DOUBLE: TOPOLOGY and YOUNG RASCAL
TOPOLOGY is fancied to get back to winning form by beating nine rivals for the concluding Matchbook Casino Apprentice Handicap (5.00) at Kempton Park.
A winner over course and distance three starts ago, Joe Tuite’s six-year-old didn’t get the breaks when a close second to Trailboss here 13 days ago and a 2lb nudge up the weights should not prevent another bold show.
