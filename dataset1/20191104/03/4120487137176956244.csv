美印贸易关系恶化：70亿美元出口补贴之争 WTO为何判美国赢

04 Nov 2019, 03:32

【第一财经】美国与印度之间的贸易摩擦近日显现出继续恶化的迹象。当地时间10月31日，世贸组织(WTO)做出了关于美国诉印度出口相关措施案(下称“DS541案”)的争端小组裁决，判定美方胜诉，印方涉及70多亿美元的出口商品补贴违反WTO规则。第一财经记者从权威渠道拿到了WTO判决书，WTO判决小组认为，印度以免征关税、提供税收减免以及发行印度公司可用的票据(或“便签”)，并随后用该票据偿还政府某些债务的方式给予出口补贴，这种补贴并不符合WTO规则。具体而言，WTO方面认定，印度向国内钢铁产品、药品、化学制品、信息技术产品，纺织品和服装的生产者提供了(WTO)规定禁止的补贴。WTO建议印度在未来90~180天内撤销这类补贴。WTO:印度不应继续享受豁免2018年3月，美国正式在WTO就印度在出口补贴方面的违规问题提起诉讼。WTO规则明确禁止成员方在贸易中进行补贴，但其为特定发展中国家留出了例外条件，允许这些特定发展中国家暂时提供出口补贴。通常人均国民生产总值(GNP)低于1000美元的国家可以享有该项豁免。美方提出，印度最初是该类别成员，但在2015年时，印度的经济已超过了该基准，但当豁免权失效后，印度一直没有撤销其出口补贴。这导致印度企业仍可以从这些出口补贴项目中获得超过70亿美元。第一财经记者从WTO的判决书中看到，WTO争端解决小组也正是基于上述原因，做出了美国胜诉的判决。在案件中，印度提出根据WTO《补贴与反补贴措施协定》(SCM)的特殊和差别待遇规定，印度可以继续在出口补贴方面享受豁免。WTO专家组则驳回了印度的说法。专家们普遍认为，印度已经从其最初应享的豁免中“毕业”了，没有资格获得进一步的过渡期。专家组列出了印度违反WTO法的五项政策，分别是：印度商品出口计划(MEIS)；出口导向型单位计划及相关部门的具体方案(EOU)； 经济特区(SEZ)；出口促进资本货物计划(EPCG)以及和出口程序的免税进口政策 (DFIS)。WTO称，目前印度已迅速将MEIS扩展到8000多种合格产品上。从经济特区(SEZ)出口的额度，在2000年到2017年期间增长了6000%以上，仅在2016年，该项出口额就已超过了820亿美元，占印度总出口额的30%。如前所述，WTO给了印度最多6个月的时间撤销这五项涉及出口补贴的政策优惠措施。按照WTO程序，印度可以选择上诉。根据印度最大的通讯社PTI报道，印度国内官员已表示将会对此提起上诉。通常在上诉终裁后，如果被诉方没有在合理期限内执行裁决，或争端各方没有就补偿问题达成协议的话，投诉方可以选择贸易报复，报复额度则需要经过WTO批准。美印贸易关系持续恶化美国特朗普政府一直质疑WTO的公平性和有效性，并阻碍WTO上诉机构开启新法官甄选程序。然而，美方同时仍在不断利用WTO的争端解决体系。此次，在WTO宣判DS541案结果后，美国贸易代表莱特希泽(Robert Lighthizer)迅速发声明称这一决定是“巨大的胜利”，美国正在使用包括WTO在内的所有工具来确保每个工人享有公平竞争环境。需要指出的是，美印贸易关系正是在美国于2018年3月启动DS541案诉讼后开始恶化的。今年6月，美国总统特朗普表示，由于印度未能确保向美国提供公平、合理的市场准入，根据《1974年贸易法》授权，美国政府终止其普惠制待遇。普惠制是指发达国家单方面对从发展中国家输入的制成品和半成品普遍给予优惠关税待遇的一种国际贸易制度，是在最惠国待遇税率基础上进一步减税或全部免税的更优惠待遇。当月，印度选择了报复美国，对杏仁、豆类和核桃等28种美国商品加征关税。当下，为了重新享受普惠制，印度打算作出改变，譬如放宽对美国医疗设备进口的价格管制，以及削减对高科技产品、摩托车等一些美国商品的关税。然而莱特希泽带领的谈判团队的要价很高，不仅要求印度大幅改变目前印度国内的电子商务法，对包括美国农产品在内的大部分产品减免关税；同时，还拒绝全面恢复印度此前享受的普惠制，仅表示可以恢复50%的优惠额度。英国皇家国际事务研究所亚太项目副研究员沙斯特里(Vasuki Shastry)此前在接受第一财经记者采访时指出：“美印之间的贸易摩擦，与美国和其他主要贸易伙伴的紧张关系非常不同，并不是那么剧烈，只能算是一种低强度的贸易摩擦。目前美国希望获得更大的市场准入，尤其是在科技领域。”“印度总理莫迪想要的其实很简单，就是希望重新恢复普惠制关税优惠。印度正在发展外向型经济，在过去几年中增长势头可观，而且莫迪政府非常热衷于吸引投资，刺激制造业发展。换言之，这一要求对印度来说很迫切。”沙斯特里认为，但期望印度满足美国不对称的市场准入需求并不容易。如同特朗普“美国优先”的哲学，莫迪政府的经济政策同样倾向于本土发展。

US-India trade relations deteriorate: $7 billion in export subsidies

04 Nov 2019, 03:32

[First Financial News] The trade friction between the United States and India has shown signs of further deterioration. On October 31, local time, the World Trade Organization (WTO) made a dispute panel on the US v. India export-related measures (hereinafter referred to as ""DS541 case""), judging that the US won the case, and the Indian side involved more than $7 billion in export commodities. Subsidies violate WTO rules. The First Financial Journal reporter obtained the WTO judgment from the authoritative channel. The WTO Judgment Group believes that India will exempt tariffs, provide tax relief and issue bills (or “scratch notes” available to Indian companies, and then use the bill to repay certain government debts. The way to give export subsidies, such subsidies do not comply with WTO rules. Specifically, the WTO has determined that India provides subsidies (WTO) to domestic producers of steel products, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, information technology products, textiles and clothing. The WTO recommends that India withdraw such subsidies in the next 90 to 180 days. WTO: India should not continue to enjoy exemption In March 2018, the United States officially filed a lawsuit against India on violations of export subsidies. The WTO rules explicitly prohibit members from subsidizing trade, but they set aside exceptions for specific developing countries, allowing these specific developing countries to temporarily provide export subsidies. This exemption is generally available to countries with a per capita gross national product (GNP) of less than $1,000. The US proposed that India was originally a member of this category, but in 2015, India's economy has exceeded the benchmark, but India has not revoked its export subsidies when the immunity expires. This has led to Indian companies still getting more than $7 billion from these export subsidy programs. The First Financial Reporter saw from the WTO's judgment that the WTO Dispute Settlement Team also made the judgment of the US victory based on the above reasons. In the case, India proposed that under the WTO Special Provisions and Differential Treatment Regulations of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM), India can continue to enjoy exemptions in export subsidies. The WTO expert group rejected the Indian statement. Experts generally believe that India has “graduated” from its initial entitlement and is not eligible for a further transition period. The expert group listed five policies of India's violation of the WTO law: the Indian Commodity Export Program (MEIS); the Export-Oriented Unit Program and the relevant department's specific program (EOU); the Special Economic Zone (SEZ); Export Promotion Capital Goods Plan (EPCG) and Tax Free Import Policy (DFIS) for export procedures. According to the WTO, India has rapidly expanded MEIS to more than 8,000 qualified products. The amount of exports from the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) increased by more than 6,000% between 2000 and 2017. In 2016 alone, the export volume exceeded US$82 billion, accounting for 30% of India's total exports. As mentioned earlier, the WTO gave India up to six months to withdraw the five policy incentives involving export subsidies. According to the WTO procedures, India can choose to appeal. According to PTI, India's largest news agency, Indian domestic officials have said they will appeal. Usually after the final ruling of the appeal, if the respondent fails to enforce the ruling within a reasonable period of time, or if the parties to the dispute do not reach an agreement on compensation, the complainant may choose to retaliate by trade, and the amount of retaliation needs to be approved by the WTO. US-India trade relations continue to deteriorate The US Trump administration has been questioning the fairness and effectiveness of the WTO and has prevented the WTO Appellate Body from opening a new judge selection process. However, the US is still using the WTO dispute settlement system. This time, after the WTO sentenced the DS541 case, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer quickly issued a statement saying that the decision was a ""great victory."" The United States is using all tools including the WTO to ensure each worker. Enjoy a level playing field. It should be pointed out that the US-India trade relationship began to deteriorate after the United States launched the DS541 lawsuit in March 2018. In June this year, US President Trump said that because India failed to ensure fair and reasonable market access to the United States, the US government terminated its GSP treatment under the 1974 Trade Act. The GSP refers to an international trading system in which developed countries unilaterally grant preferential tariff treatment to manufactured goods and semi-finished products imported from developing countries. It is a more preferential treatment for further tax reduction or full tax exemption based on the MFN rate. . In the month, India chose to retaliate against the United States and impose tariffs on 28 US goods such as almonds, beans and walnuts. Now, in order to regain the GSP, India intends to make changes, such as relaxing the price controls on US medical equipment imports, and cutting tariffs on some US goods such as high-tech products and motorcycles. However, the negotiating team led by Wright Heze has a high asking price, which not only requires India to significantly change the current e-commerce law in India, but also to reduce tariffs on most products including American agricultural products. At the same time, it also refuses to fully restore the previously enjoyed The system of benefits only means that the 50% discount can be restored. Vasuki Shastry, an associate researcher at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in the Asia-Pacific region, said in an interview with the First Financial News: ""The trade friction between the United States and India is very different from the tension between the United States and other major trading partners. It is not so intense, it can only be regarded as a kind of low-intensity trade friction. At present, the United States hopes to gain greater market access, especially in the field of science and technology."" ""Indian Prime Minister Modi wants to be very simple, that is, hope to re Restoring GSP tariffs. India is developing an export-oriented economy, which has grown considerably over the past few years, and the Modi government is very keen to attract investment and stimulate manufacturing. In other words, this requirement is urgent for India. Shastri believes, but it is not easy to expect India to meet the asymmetric market access needs of the United States. Like Trump's ""American First"" philosophy, the Modi government's economic policy also tends to develop locally.
