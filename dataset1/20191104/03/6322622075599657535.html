      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 4): Worldwide sales of semiconductors rose 8.2% quarter-on-quarter to US$106.7 billion during the third quarter of 2019 (3Q19), according to the US-based Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).</p>
      <p>In a statement on its website Nov 1, SIA, however, said the figure was 14.6% less than the third quarter of 2018.</p>
      <p>It said global sales for the month of September 2019 reached US$35.6 billion, an increase of 3.4% over August's total and 14.6% less than sales from September 2018.</p>
      <p>All monthly sales numbers are compiled by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) organisation and represent a three-month moving average.</p>
      <p>SIA president and CEO John Neuffer said following months of slower sales earlier in the year, the global semiconductor market rebounded somewhat in 3Q19.</p>
      <p>"While sales remain well behind the record totals from last year, month-to-month sales increased for the third consecutive month in September and were up across all major product categories.</p>
      <p>"Month-to-month sales also increased across all regional markets, with China and the Americas leading the way," he said.</p>
      <p>SIA said that regionally, sales increased compared to August 2019 in China (4.4%), the Americas (4.3%), Europe (2.9%), Asia Pacific/All Other (2.4%), and Japan (1.2%).</p>
      <p>It said sales were down across all regions compared to September 2018: Europe (-6.4%), Asia Pacific/All Other (-6.9%), Japan (-10.0%), China (-12.9%), and the Americas (-30.4%).</p>
