      <h1>Officials warn of landslides, floods, as Bali enters rainy season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T03:58:02+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 03:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bali" target="_blank">Coconuts Bali</a></address>
      <p>Now that some parts of Bali have officially entered the rainy season, the local chapter of Indonesia’s Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) has issued a reminder for islanders to remain cautious, citing possibilities of landslides, floods and strong winds. </p>
      <p>“The local government should be cleaning the waterways before we get to the peak of the rainy season. They should also start cutting tree branches,” <a href="https://regional.kompas.com/read/2019/11/03/14470371/bbmkg-ingatkan-pemerintah-bali-agar-waspada-potensi-bencana-saat-musim-hujan">Iman Faturahman, who heads the data and information department at one of the BMKG chapters in Denpasar, told <i>Kompas.com</i>. </a></p>
      <p>According to Imam, strong winds are likely to take place during this season and could therefore result in trees collapsing. </p>
      <p>Over the weekend, rain fell on some parts of the island, including Bangli and Karangasem. </p>

      <p>Imam said that peak of the rainy season will likely fall either in January or February of next year. </p>
      <p>A similar warning was also issued by the Bali Regional Disaster Management Agency (BPBD).</p>
      <p>“There’s even a possibility of hail and high tides on the coastline. The threat of hydrometeorological disasters such as floods and landslides are highly possible during the rainy season,” <a href="https://www.merdeka.com/peristiwa/masuk-musim-hujan-warga-bali-diminta-waspadai-ancaman-bencana.html">BPBD Bali acting head, I Made Rentin, told <i>Merdeka.com</i>.</a></p>
      <p>Rentin said that landslides are more likely to occur in Karangasem, Bangli, Buleleng, Tabanan and Jembrana, while all areas across the island could potentially experience floods. </p>
