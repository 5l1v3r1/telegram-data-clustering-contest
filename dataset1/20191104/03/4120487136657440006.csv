【梭罗10月29日讯】大印尼行动党（Gerindra）计划提议我国第一任总统苏加诺的孙子潘德拉（GPH Paundrakarna Sukmaputra Jiwanegara）与佐科威总统公子吉布兰（Gibran Rakabuming Raka）搭档参选2020年梭罗市市长选举。梭罗大印尼行动党分区理事会（DPC）主席阿迪延多（Ardianto Kuswinarno）认为，如果佐科威总统儿子吉布兰与潘德拉搭档参选2020年梭罗市市长是最佳拍档。“ 他们俩都还很年轻。潘德拉是位艺术家人道主义者。而吉布兰是一位成功的商人。 我认为他们两个都有能力领导和建设梭罗市。”阿迪延多周二（10月29日）对记者如是说道。潘德拉除了被称为艺术家外，还曾是斗争民主党（PDIP）的政治人物。 KGPAA Mangkunegoro 九世和Sukmawati Soekarnoputri曾是梭罗的地方议会（DPRD）成员。但是，他们被免职，因为他们被认为不太积极参加地方议会的活动。“至少潘德拉具有政治经验。因此，尽管还有一些缺点，但他可以快速地学习。” 阿迪延多说。阿迪延多说，吉布兰仍有机会获得斗争民主党中央理事会的推荐。同时，在梭罗地方议会中拥有3个席位的大印尼行动党必须与其他政党结成联盟，以便能够推举候选人。
