香港11.3抗爭兩記者被拘 議員耳朵被咬掉（視頻）

04 Nov 2019, 03:09

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】11月3日，港島太古城中心舉行人鏈抗議活動，警方闖入抓捕多人，其中包括2名記者。當晚，一名說普通話的持刀男子在商城外瘋狂砍殺民眾，至少6人受傷，2人危殆。暴徒還凶殘地將一名區議員的左耳朵咬掉一塊，民眾衝上前解救，痛毆暴徒。但警方卻放縱暴徒，令民眾質疑。
繼11月2日，港警暴力鎮壓抗議活動，並創下一天內抓捕民眾超過200百人的記錄。3日，港人再次舉行「香港人反警暴，七區緊急行街（逛街）」抗議行動。
3日下午1點，大批民眾自發在金鐘添馬公園、旺角麥花臣球場、黃大仙廣場、大埔超級城、沙田百步梯、荃灣公園及屯門文娛廣場舉行「行街」活動，控訴警方濫用暴力。
1點左右，大批港警在不少地區戒備，並開始暴力驅散民眾，抓捕多人。
當晚，民眾在港島太古城舉行「東區集會人鏈日」活動，不少民眾在太古城中心商場內手拉手環繞一週，組成人鏈，高呼反送中口號並合唱《願榮光歸香港》，過程平和。
傍晚6點30分左右，大批警察突然衝入商場，抓捕至少2名年輕人，引起在場市民不滿。警察一度舉槍恫嚇及指罵民眾，並繼續在商場搜查，而商場職員也配合警方，鎖上了部分出入口玻璃門。
警方在抓捕市民過程中，《立場新聞》一名特約攝影記者在合理距離拍攝時，突然被多名警察強壓在地上拘捕，導致其背部受傷，警方聲稱他涉嫌阻差辦公。該記者被捕時還佩戴著記者證。



事後，《立場新聞》強調，記者有權在現場採訪，要求警方交代記者被捕原因，並儘快讓被捕人會晤該媒體為其聯繫好的律師代表。
就在警察離開後不久，晚7點40分左右，在太古城中心外，一名說普通話的灰衫男子突然從背包裡抽出長刀，砍殺在場民眾。一名黑衣男子背部被砍多刀，流血不止；一名女子也受傷，跪坐在地上。該男子砍人後用普通話高喊「光復台灣」。
當時正在太古城的西區議員、民主動力召集人趙家賢連忙上前勸阻這名暴徒，問他為何砍人，暴徒回應說「不是我打人，我打狗」。



隨即，該暴徒衝過來抱住趙家賢，並凶殘地將他左耳朵咬下一大塊。當時有多位民眾上前解救，將暴徒拉開。這名暴徒的惡行激起眾怒，他被憤怒的人群追打、制服，之後警察趕到現場。



趙家賢左耳朵鮮血直流，被暴徒咬掉的一塊隨後被朋友撿起用塑膠袋裝好，他被送到醫院救治，能否將耳朵接上尚不清楚。
據港媒報導，這起暴徒行凶事件造成6人受傷送院，至少4人被砍傷，其中2人傷勢嚴重，現場鮮血遍地。
有分析認為，這起暴力事件疑點重重，這名暴徒事先已在背包內藏刀，並且選擇在警察走後再襲擊抗議者，似乎是有備而來。
疑點一，暴徒砍人時高叫「光復台灣」，莫名其妙，是否有意嫁禍台灣？
疑點二，該暴徒除了持刀砍人，還出現少有的咬人行為。從錄像顯示，凶嫌咬人時，處於極度瘋狂亢奮狀態，似乎吃了興奮劑。
疑點三，錄像顯示，警察到場後，面對危險凶嫌，並沒有立即給其戴上手銬，控制其行動自由，採用一種半放任的處理方法。
疑點四，港警此前拘捕抗爭市民時，4、5個警察粗暴地對付一名抗爭者，即使是女性也是立刻反綁其雙手。警方對待市民與該嫌犯的行為形成強烈對比，令民眾產生質疑。
在這起暴力事件後，警察又在商場抓捕了一名浸會大學編委記者，浸大記者被捕時，向商場其他記者大聲呼喊：「我不會自殺」。該記者還披露，抓捕他的警察警告說，他會被「雞姦」。浸大記者被捕時也佩戴了記者證。
浸大編委會對其記者被捕一事表示強烈譴責，譴責警察無理拘捕，打壓新聞自由。編委會促請校方盡快跟進案件，保護學生。

Hong Kong 11.3 fights against two reporters who are detained and their ears are bitten off (video)

04 Nov 2019, 03:09

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] On November 3, the Hong Kong Island Taikoo City Center held a chain of people protests. The police broke into many people, including two reporters. That night, a man with a Mandarin-speaking knife slashed the people outside the mall, at least 6 people were injured and 2 were critical. The mob also fiercely bit the piece of the left ear of a district board member, and the people rushed forward to save and scream the mob. However, the police indulged the mob and made the people question.
Following the November 2nd, the Hong Kong police violently suppressed the protests and set a record of arresting more than 200 people in the next day. On the 3rd, the Hong Kong people once again held a ""Hong Kong people anti-violence, seven districts emergency street (shopping)"" protest action.
At 1 pm on the 3rd, a large number of people voluntarily held a ""street street"" event at the Tamar Park in Admiralty, the Macpherson Court in Mong Kok, Wong Tai Sin Plaza, Tai Po Super City, Sha Tin Pak Lai Tsui, Tsuen Wan Estate and Tuen Mun. Abuse of violence.
Around 1 o'clock, a large number of Hong Kong police officers were on alert in many areas and began to violently disperse the people and arrest many people.
On the evening, the people held the ""East District People's Chain Day"" event in Taikoo Shing, Hong Kong Island. Many people gathered hand in hand in the Taikoo Shing Center shopping mall to form a chain of people. They shouted slogans and sang ""Glory to Hong Kong"". The process is peaceful.
Around 6:30 in the evening, a large number of police officers suddenly rushed into the mall and arrested at least two young people, causing dissatisfaction among the citizens present. The police once shot and threatened the public and continued to search in the mall. The staff of the mall also cooperated with the police to lock in some of the entrance and exit glass doors.
During the arrest of the public, a special photojournalist of ""Standing News"" was suddenly arrested by a number of police officers on the ground when shooting at a reasonable distance, causing injuries to his back. The police claimed that he was suspected of obstructing the office. The reporter was also wearing a press card when he was arrested.



Afterwards, ""Standing News"" stressed that the reporter has the right to interview on the spot, asking the police to explain the reasons for the arrest of the reporter, and let the arrested person meet with the media as a representative of the lawyer.
Shortly after the police left, around 7:40 pm, outside the center of Taikoo City, a man in a gray shirt who said Mandarin suddenly took a long knife from his backpack and smashed the people present. A black man was cut in the back with multiple knives and bleeding; a woman was also injured and sat down on the ground. After the man hacked, he shouted ""Recovering Taiwan"" in Mandarin.
Zhao Jiaxian, a member of the Western District Council and the Democratic Power Convenor at Taikoo City, quickly stepped forward to discourage the mob and asked him why he hacked. The mob responded that ""I am not beating, I am a dog.""



Immediately, the mob rushed over to hug Zhao Jiaxian and brutally bit his left ear. At that time, many people came to the rescue and opened the mob. The violent behavior of the mob provoked anger. He was chased and subdued by angry crowds, and the police rushed to the scene.



Zhao Jiaxian's left ear was bloody, and the piece that was bitten by the mob was later picked up by a friend and packed in a plastic bag. He was sent to the hospital for treatment. It is not clear whether he can pick up the ear.
According to Hong Kong media reports, six people were injured and sent to hospital, and at least four people were wounded. Two of them were seriously injured and blood was everywhere.
Some analysts believe that this violent incident is very doubtful. The mob has already set a knife in the backpack beforehand, and chose to attack the protesters after the police left. It seems that it is well prepared.
Doubtful point, when the mob slashes people, it is called ""recovering Taiwan"". It is inexplicable. Is it intentional to blame Taiwan?
Doubt 2, the mob, in addition to knife hacking, there are rare biting behavior. From the video shows that when the fierce bite is biting, it is in a state of extreme madness and excitement, and seems to have eaten stimulants.
Suspicious point three, the video shows that after the police arrived, they faced dangerous dangers and did not immediately handcuff them, control their freedom of movement, and adopt a semi-discrete treatment.
Doubt 4: When the Hong Kong police arrested the anti-competitive citizens, four or five police officers violently dealt with a protester. Even women were immediately tied to their hands. The police treated the public in sharp contrast with the behavior of the suspect and caused doubts.
After the violent incident, the police arrested a reporter from the editorial board of a Baptist University in the mall. When the reporter of the Baptist University was arrested, he shouted to other reporters in the mall: ""I will not commit suicide."" The reporter also disclosed that the police who arrested him warned that he would be ""smuggled."" The reporter of the Baptist University was also wearing a press card when he was arrested.
The Baptist editorial board strongly condemned the arrest of his reporter and condemned the police for unreasonable arrest and suppression of press freedom. The editorial committee urged the school to follow up the case as soon as possible to protect the students.
