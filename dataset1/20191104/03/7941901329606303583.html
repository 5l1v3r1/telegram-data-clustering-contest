      <p>Oracle opened its appeal in a legal challenge of a Pentagon cloud-computing <a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/story/19/10/26/0151216/microsoft-beats-amazon-to-win-the-pentagons-10-billion-jedi-cloud-contract">contract valued at as much as $10 billion</a> with a familiar argument: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-04/oracle-revives-charges-that-jedi-bid-tainted-by-amazon-conflicts">the procurement was unfairly tailored for Amazon.com</a>. From a report:<i> In in its opening brief, which was filed on Friday, Oracle said the cloud project violated federal procurement law and was tainted by relationships between former Pentagon officials and Amazon. Oracle is appealing a July ruling from the U.S. Court of Federal Claims that dismissed its legal challenge of the cloud contract based on similar claims. At the same time, Amazon is mulling its own potential legal challenge of the project after losing the deal to Microsoft Corp. late last month, Bloomberg has reported. The legal challenges could revive fresh criticism from industry, lawmakers and analysts of the Pentagon's handling of the controversial cloud project, known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI. The project is designed to consolidate the Pentagon's cloud computing infrastructure and modernize its technology systems. The Defense Department is facing accusations that former employees with ties to Amazon may have structured the deal to favor Amazon and that President Donald Trump may have unfairly intervened in the process against Amazon. Trump has long been at <a href="https://politics.slashdot.org/story/17/06/28/1540239/president-trump-attacks-amazon-incorrectly-claiming-that-it-owns-the-washington-post-for-tax-purposes">odds with Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos</a>, who also owns the Washington Post.</i></p>
