Architectural design of a space and the furniture chosen to fill it can work together to define a room's function, set a certain vibe, and make a statement. While an architect or designer may want specific furniture to create a certain look at the time of design completion, versatility is also important over the course of a building's life. Not only do the needs of building programs and inhabitants shift over time, but owners of commercial and public spaces often want the ability to react to both aesthetic and social trends to keep up-to-date. 
The design of a space, including its furniture, must reflect its intended use and function, which involves an understanding not only of good design, but also of the social and cultural influences present in any given location. Furniture that is stylish, yet timeless and functional, should be the goal for a long-lasting and flexible design. Well-designed furniture can adapt to multiple uses and types of spaces over time, as well as different locations and cultures worldwide. A notable Italian furniture design company, Flexform, has utilized many of these design principles in the company’s portfolio of contemporary style furniture. Originally the handmade crafts of the Galimberti brothers in 1959, ‘Flexform di Galimberti’s’ early success led the company to expand and grow - allowing many of these timeless pieces to be incorporated into the fabric of international architecture.
