互驅使節 薩爾瓦多不承認馬杜羅政權

04 Nov 2019, 03:05

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】薩爾瓦多在新總統布格磊（Nayib Bukele）帶領下，不承認委內瑞拉總統馬杜羅政權的合法性，勒令委國外交官離開薩爾瓦多，委內瑞拉3日也以驅逐薩國駐卡拉卡斯大使做為回應。
布格磊2日晚間在推特發表聲明，指薩爾瓦多已要求「馬杜羅政權的外交使節團」在48小時內離開薩國。
委內瑞拉外交部3日也回應表示，駐卡拉卡斯的薩國外交人員都是「不受歡迎的人」，並以勒令他們在48小時內離境。
馬杜羅的左派政府拘押多名反對派領袖，且被控在全國經濟崩潰之際，不惜對反對派人士動用刑求和任意逮捕等舉措，以繼續掌權。馬杜羅政權仍獲俄羅斯和中共支持。

布格磊是宣布馬杜羅（Nicolas Maduro）政權不合法的50多個國家之一，轉而承認馬杜羅的主要對手、國民議會議長瓜伊多（Juan Guaido）為委內瑞拉總統。
瓜伊多今年一月自行宣布出任委國臨時總統，美國總統川普是最先承認瓜伊多政權的領導人之一。
布格磊在6月當選前曾表示，他將與卡拉卡斯方面保持「距離」，並與馬杜羅最大外交敵人美國建立更密切關係。
美國駐薩爾瓦多大使強生（Ron Johnson）對此做出正面回應，在推特說：「我們為布格磊總統確保薩爾瓦多處於歷史正確一方鼓掌。」

Mutual Envoys El Salvador does not recognize the Maduro regime

04 Nov 2019, 03:05

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] El Salvador, under the leadership of new President Nayib Bukele, did not recognize the legitimacy of the Venezuelan President Maduro’s regime, ordered the diplomats to leave El Salvador, and Venezuela on the 3rd. The expulsion of the Ambassador of Saskatchewan to Karakas responded.
On the evening of the 2nd, Bouguer published a statement on Twitter, stating that El Salvador had requested that the diplomatic corps of the Maduro regime leave the country within 48 hours.
The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry also responded on the 3rd that the Saskatchewan diplomats in Karakas were ""unwelcome people"" and ordered them to leave within 48 hours.
Maduro’s left-wing government detained several opposition leaders and was accused of continuing to take power in opposition to the opposition’s use of criminal appeal and arbitrary arrests as the nation’s economy collapsed. The Maduro regime is still supported by Russia and the CCP.

Bouguer is one of more than 50 countries that announced the illegality of Nicolas Maduro's regime, and instead acknowledged Maduro's main opponent, National Assembly Speaker Juan Guaido, as the Venezuelan president.
Guaido announced his own appointment as the interim president of the committee in January this year. US President Trump was one of the first leaders to recognize the Guaydo regime.
Before he was elected in June, Bugley said that he would maintain a ""distance"" with Caracas and establish a closer relationship with Maduro's biggest diplomatic enemy, the United States.
Ron Johnson, the US ambassador to El Salvador, responded positively to Twitter, saying: ""We applaud President Bouguerre to ensure that El Salvador is on the right side of history.""
