從10月開始向高雄市政府請假，全力投入2020總統大選的國民黨參選人韓國瑜，目前正在全台進行「傾聽之旅」，「最強分身」夫人李佳芬也在全台各地舉行「佳芬講堂」幫忙魅力拉票，昨（3日）她在台中被問到韓國瑜的學貸免息政策，有支持者建議應做好防弊，不然若遇到有學生貸款出國後就不還怎麼辦，李佳芬表示「政府就吞了吧」「反正幾千億都在浪費了」。
韓國瑜競選辦公室舉辦的「佳芬講堂巡迴首站in台中場」昨（3日）登場，韓國瑜的最強分身夫人李佳芬親自到場展現魅力，為韓國瑜宣傳教育政策，包括雙語教學、交換學生與學貸免息等。
有支持者問到韓國瑜日前提出的學貸免息政策，建議應做好防弊措施，否則可能遇到有學生申請學貸旅外讀書後不還錢，可能形成呆帳。
李佳芬回答，銀行本來就多少都會有呆帳，不能因為有呆帳而不去執行政策，防弊不是最重要的，李佳芬認為「學生付不出學貸，可能有些難言之隱，那政府就吞了吧，反正幾千億都在浪費了」。
