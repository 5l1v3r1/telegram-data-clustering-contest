網紅郭美美出獄後 曬海外逍遙生活照

04 Nov 2019, 03:27

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】大陸炫富女郭美美出獄不久便炫富曬出百萬卡地亞飾品，如今再炫自己在海外逍遙快活的旅遊照片。從她晒出的照片可見，其消費的檔次很高，其容貌也與剛出獄時大有變化。
8年前的「郭美美事件」，與網紅、「性」、「炫富」、「賭球」、「紅十字會」、「乾爹」等敏感詞彙相互勾連。5年前郭美美因開設賭場罪獲刑。
今年早些時候郭美美出獄後僅3天，網路傳出一張郭美美的照片，只見其身形圓潤，和入獄前相比胖了一圈。
郭出獄後一個月，網絡上又流出其一組近照，只見她染了一頭紫色頭髮，自拍擺pose顯得非常自信，鼻梁挺拔、下巴尖瘦，與剛出獄時判若兩人。
網友從郭美美的近照中，還發現她手上依然戴著鑽石手鐲和手錶，脖子上有看起來價值不菲的頸鏈，耳環也是高檔奢侈品。
有網友說，「出獄之後，行事還是這麼高調，真是難改愛炫富的本性。」

郭美美似乎毫不在意外界對她的評論，她對今後的打算說的很明白，就是希望能多學一些東西，提高一下自我，然後繼續做網紅或者主播，準備在這方面東山再起。
最近郭美美晒出赴泰國曼谷旅遊的照片，照片可見，她所消費的檔次挺高。
有網友「 徒步拉薩 」發文說，更令人關注的是，郭美美的鼻子跟之前有些不同，變得更加堅挺了。郭美美現在既出去旅遊，還做了整形，看來手上確實有點錢。拋開這些不說，她所展示的生活狀態，可能就是現在真實的狀態，和一般人沒什麼不同。
別忘了，郭美美曾經是一個大人物，影響過很多人，她的復出在某種程度上是提醒大家想起以前發生過的事情，以及對某些事物的看法。
網友說，郭美美即便是想低調恐怕也不現實，多少雙眼睛和媒體都在關注著她呢。從她最近的表現來看，似乎是為了回歸做準備，只是大家還能再接受她嗎？

「郭美美事件」事發於8年前，2011年微博認證身分為「中國紅十字會商業總經理」的郭美美，在微博上炫富，住大別墅，開瑪莎拉蒂，蘭博基尼，晒名表和擁有十幾個愛馬仕包等。
當時的郭美美炫富事件，引起軒然大波，公眾質疑中國紅十字會所獲善款流向。
儘管中共紅會官員聲稱，「郭美美與紅十字總會無關」，但紅十字會自此名聲掃地，信用全盤崩塌，獲捐款項一落千丈。
2013年4.21雅安地震，紅十字會在震後第一時間微博呼籲捐款，不到兩天裡，得到卻是超過14萬個「滾」字。之後，紅十字會揚言要重新調查郭美美事件，而郭美美強硬回應：誰敢動我一根毫毛，就立即公布內幕。
事後，郭美美未遭任何處理，紅十字會甚至主動放棄了對「郭美美事件」的重啟調查。外界紛紛猜測郭背後有強大後台。
有關郭美美的「乾爹」或「男友」傳出多個版本。其眾乾爹中官職最大的是中共前常委劉雲山，不過相關說法至今未得到證實。
2014年7月，郭美美因在巴西世界盃期間涉嫌賭球，被警方控制後，郭被爆出在澳門賭博欠下2億6千萬元賭債，很快又有人替她償還。
郭美美被抓不久，蒲匯塘漁夫博客文章披露，郭美美的後台是劉雲山。郭美美背後還有強力公關團隊，很多中共高官也在郭的陪伺名單上。
2015年9月，郭美美被判處有期徒刑5年，並處罰金5萬元。扣除判刑前的羈押時間，郭美美服刑5年，未曾減刑。

Net red Guo Meimei after he was released from prison

04 Nov 2019, 03:27

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] The mainland's show-funded female Guo Meimei was released from prison soon and she showed off a million Cartier jewelry. Now she is showing off her own happy overseas travel photos. It can be seen from the photos she has exposed that the level of consumption is very high, and its appearance is also very different from when it was just released from prison.
Eight years ago, the ""Guo Meimei Incident"" was linked to sensitive vocabulary such as Net Red, ""Sex"", ""Hyunfu"", ""Gambling"", ""Red Cross"" and ""Cognac"". Five years ago, Guo Meimei was sentenced for the crime of opening a casino.
Earlier this year, only three days after Guo Meimei was released from prison, a photo of Guo Meimei was sent out on the Internet. I saw that his figure was round and he was fatter than before he was in prison.
One month after Guo was released from prison, a group of recent photos appeared on the Internet. She saw that she had dyed a purple hair. She was very confident in her self-portrait, her nose was straight and her chin was thin, and she was sentenced to two when she was just released from prison.
From the recent photos of Guo Meimei, netizens also found that she still wears diamond bracelets and watches on her hands. There are necklaces that look worthy on the neck. Earrings are also high-end luxury goods.
Some netizens said, ""After being released from prison, it is still so high-profile. It is really difficult to change the nature of love and show off wealth.""

Guo Meimei seems to have no comment on her in the accident circle. She is very clear about her plans for the future. She hopes to learn more things, improve her self, and then continue to do net red or anchor, ready to make a comeback in this regard.
Recently, Guo Meimei has taken photos of her trip to Bangkok, Thailand. The photos show that she has a very high grade.
Some netizens ""Lhasa on foot"" issued a message saying that what is more interesting is that Guo Meimei's nose is somewhat different and has become stronger. Guo Meimei is now going out for a trip and doing plastic surgery. It seems that she has a lot of money on her hands. Aside from these, the state of life that she showed may be the current state of reality, no different from the average person.
Don't forget, Guo Meimei used to be a big man and influenced many people. Her comeback is to some extent reminding everyone of what happened before and what they think about certain things.
Netizens said that even if Guo Meimei wants to keep a low profile, I am afraid it is not realistic. How many eyes and media are paying attention to her. Judging from her recent performance, it seems that she is preparing for the return, but can everyone accept her again?

""Guo Meimei Incident"" was launched 8 years ago. In 2011, Weibo was certified as ""China Red Cross Commercial General Manager"" by Guo Meimei. She showed off her wealth on Weibo, lived in a big villa, opened Maserati, Lamborghini, and sun-named watches. And have a dozen Hermes bags and so on.
At that time, Guo Meimei’s show-off incident caused a great uproar, and the public questioned the flow of money received by the Chinese Red Cross.
Although the CCP Red Cross official claimed that ""Guo Meimei has nothing to do with the Red Cross Society,"" the Red Cross has since swept away its reputation, credit has collapsed, and donations have plummeted.
In the 4.21 Ya'an earthquake in 2013, the Red Cross called for donations in the first time after the earthquake. In less than two days, it received more than 140,000 ""rolling"" words. After that, the Red Cross threatened to re-investigate Guo Meimei's incident, and Guo Meimei responded with a strong response: Whoever dares to move me a hair, immediately announced the inside story.
Afterwards, Guo Meimei was not dealt with anything, and the Red Cross even voluntarily gave up the investigation of the restart of the ""Guo Meimei Incident."" The outside world has speculated that there is a strong backstage behind Guo.
There are several versions of Guo Meimei's ""Cognac"" or ""Boyfriend"". Liu Yunshan, the former member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China, is the biggest one in the public service. However, the relevant statements have not been confirmed so far.
In July 2014, Guo Meimei was suspected of gambling during the World Cup in Brazil. After being controlled by the police, Guo was robbed of 260 million yuan in gambling debts in Macau, and soon someone repaid her.
Guo Meimei was arrested shortly. The Puhuitang fisherman blog post revealed that Guo Meimei’s background was Liu Yunshan. There is a strong public relations team behind Guo Meimei, and many senior officials of the Chinese Communist Party are also on the list of Guo’s accompanying.
In September 2015, Guo Meimei was sentenced to 5 years in prison and fined 50,000 yuan. After deducting the time of detention before the sentence, Guo Meimei served a five-year sentence and did not commute her sentence.
