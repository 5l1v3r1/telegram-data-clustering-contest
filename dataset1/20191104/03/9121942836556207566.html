      <p>LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — A Pakistani court has freed on bail the daughter of Pakistan’s ailing former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was similarly released last week from custody for medical reasons.</p>
      <p>Monday’s court decision ordered Maryam Nawaz, who has been charged with money laundering, to surrender her passport and deposit bail equivalent to $450,000, with a further $65,000 bond.</p>
      <p>She was moved last week from jail to the same hospital where her father is being treated. Her condition wasn’t specified.</p>
      <p>Monday’s development comes after the court last Tuesday suspended a conviction against the 69-year-old Sharif for eight weeks on medical grounds.</p>
      <p>He was rushed to hospital and his doctors say his health remains unstable. Sharif served three times as prime minister but was removed by the Supreme Court in 2017 for corruption.</p>
