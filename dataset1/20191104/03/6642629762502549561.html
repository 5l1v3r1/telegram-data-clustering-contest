      <p>Chinese state media has urged authorities to take a "tougher line" against protesters in Hong Kong who <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/hong-kong-protests-mall-clash-sees-knife-attack-bitten-ear-191103145707691.html">vandalised state-run Xinhua news agency</a> and other buildings at the weekend, saying the violence damaged the city's rule of law.</p>
      <p>The call on Monday comes as the city braces for more protests following a violent incident on Sunday, in which two people were left in critical condition.</p>

      <p>In an editorial, state-backed China Daily newspaper criticised the "wanton" attacks by "naive" demonstrators, adding, "They are doomed to fail simply because their violence will encounter the full weight of the law."</p>
      <p>Police fired tear gas at black-clad protesters on Saturday and Sunday in some of the worst violence in the Asian financial hub in weeks, with metro stations set ablaze and buildings vandalised.</p>
      <p>Violence also erupted on Sunday after a man with a knife attacked several people and bit off part of the ear of a pro-democracy politician. Two of the victims are reportedly in critical condition, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The past five months of anti-government protests in the former British colony represent the biggest popular challenge to President Xi Jinping's government since he took over China's leadership in late 2012.</p>
      <p>Protesters are angry at China's perceived meddling with Hong Kong's freedoms, including its legal system, since the Asian financial hub returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies the accusation.</p>
      <p>The widely-read Global Times tabloid on Sunday condemned the protesters' actions targeting Xinhua and called for action by Hong Kong's enforcement agencies.</p>
      <p>"Due to the symbolic image of Xinhua, the vandalizing of its branch is not only a provocation to the rule of law in Hong Kong, but also to the central government and the Chinese mainland, which is the rioters' main purpose," it said.</p>
      <p>On Friday, after a meeting of China's top leadership, a senior Chinese official said it would not tolerate separatism or threats to national security in Hong Kong and would "perfect" the way it appointed the city's leader.</p>
