雅京特区省长阿尼斯应邀 国民民主党全国代表会议或讨论2024年总统选举议题

04 Nov 2019, 03:35

【罗盘新闻网雅加达11月02日讯】 政治上从来都是没有永远的朋友和敌人,只有永恒的利益。根据政治观察家指出，国民民主党（NasDem）因为不满佐科威印尼进步内阁分配，而频频与政府以外的政党进行会谈，纵横捭阖，有意在明年的地方首长选举，尤其是2024年总统选举，建立另一个政治轴心争取最大政治利益。近日国民民主党积极与伊斯兰宗教色彩浓厚的公正福利党 (PKS)举行会谈更成为舆论的热门话题。因此，即将于11月8日至11日在雅京召开的国民民主党全国代表会议动向将成为各界观察的焦点。国民民主党主席威利·阿迪亚（Willy Aditya）说，该党已邀请雅京特区省长阿尼斯·巴斯威丹（Anies Baswedan）出席该党的全国代表会议，因为会议将讨论2024年总统选举的筹备工作和布局。“ 我们的邀请函已交给雅京省长阿尼斯。”威利周六（11月2日）在雅京中区丹拿望Sirih Merah 店进行讨论后对记者如是说道。 “ 阿尼斯作为雅京特区省长，当然，他会向来自沙璜 – 马劳奇出席代表会议的来宾致欢迎词。”威利继续说道。威利透露，不仅邀请了雅京省长阿尼斯。被邀请的还有东爪哇省长科菲法因达尔帕拉万萨（Khofifah Indar Parawansa）和其他国民民主党推荐的地方首长也应邀参加会议。当被问及国民民主党是否有可能在2024年选举中将阿尼斯和科菲法搭档总统选举时，威利再次拒绝了。“ 距离总统选举仍然很远。我们必须记住，阿尼斯和科菲法在竞选地方首长时都获得国民民主党的支持。因此，他们与国民民主党有着文化和情感上都有国民民主党的政治基因。” 威利解释说。
