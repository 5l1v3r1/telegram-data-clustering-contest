      <h1>'Still time' for Thailand to solve U.S. duty-free issue: U.S. commerce secretary</h1>

      <p>BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand still has time to renegotiate with the United States over a suspension of duty-free preferences on imports of Thai goods before the suspension takes effect in April, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Monday.</p>

      <p>The United States last month suspended duty-free treatment for $1.3 billion worth of Thai imports, including seafood products, under its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) programme, saying Thailand did not afford workers “internationally recognised worker rights”.</p>
      <p>The loss of duty-free treatment, which Thailand said would incur duties around $60 million a year for Thai products, has stirred a sense of anti-U.S. sentiment among some in the Southeast Asian country that has been enjoying closer ties with China in recent years.</p>
      <p>During a speech about U.S. commitment in Asia, Ross said that he would be remiss if he did not address the GSP issue given its publicity in Thailand.</p>
      <p>“There’s still time to renegotiate the underlying issue of workers’ rights,” Ross said, noting the suspension was scheduled to take effect in April.</p>
      <p>The value of the affected products accounts for 30% of Thai exports under GSP to the United States and around a “trivial” 0.38% of total Thai exports, Ross said.</p>
      <p>“The GSP issue has been blown way out of proportion,” he said. “It’s no big deal.”</p>
      <h3>FULLY COMMITTED</h3>
      <p>Ross spoke at the Indo-Pacific Business Forum, which is aimed at showcasing U.S. investment in the region and highlighting that its presence matters.</p>
      <p>While Washington only sent lower-level delegations to Southeast Asian summits this year without President Donald Trump nor Vice President Mike Pence, raising concerns that it could no longer be relied on as a counterweight to China’s increasing regional might, Ross gave a reassuring message.</p>
      <p>“The Trump administration is extremely engaged and fully committed to this region,” Ross said.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to negotiate trade deals with countries in this region.”</p>
