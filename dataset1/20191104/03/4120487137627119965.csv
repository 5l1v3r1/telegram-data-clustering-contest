中国冀望加强与印尼的渔业合作

04 Nov 2019, 03:36

【安塔拉雅加达讯】中华人民共和国正在探索与印度尼西亚共和国在海洋和渔业领域加强合作，特别是因为两国之间已在各领域建立的合作关系良好。安塔拉周日（11月3日）在雅加达收到的海事与渔业部新闻稿中，中国驻印尼全权大使肖千说，“印尼拥有广阔的领海和丰富的海洋资源，而中国拥有异常庞大的市场。” 肖千大使于11月1日在雅加达海事与渔业部办公室访问海事与渔业部长艾迪.帕拉波沃（Edhy Prabowo）时发表上述声明。肖千大使并借此机会祝贺艾迪.帕拉波沃就任2019-2024年任期海事与渔业部长。此外，肖千大使说，到目前为止，印尼已成为中国规模较大的贸易伙伴之一。在2018年，两国贸易额达到726亿美元。同期中国在印尼的投资额达到24亿美元。在海事和渔业领域的合作将加强两国之间的关系，两国可以通过水产品进出口实现合作机会。中国大使透露，中国每年从不同的国家进口400万吨渔业产品，印尼每年向中国出口20万吨渔业产品，仅占中国渔业每年进口配额的5％。肖千大使说，印尼有着巨大的合作空间，如果两国重新启动海洋和渔业合作，我相信印尼出口到中国的渔业产品肯定会达到惊人的数量。作为回应，海事与渔业部长艾迪.帕拉波沃对中国的提议表示欢迎，因为符合佐科威总统的指示，即需要优化印度尼西亚的渔业，包括发展水产养殖业。其中在防止虾类养殖中的病毒，艾迪希望中国能够与印尼分享其在水产养殖领域的技术和知识，因为中国是拥有预防虾类病毒传播的技术和科学的国家。艾迪表示，印尼对两国之间良好的合作机会持开放态度。即便如此，他强调，任何合作将优先为印度尼西亚吸收当地劳动力和外汇。

Indonesia exports 200,000 tons of fishery products to China every year, accounting for only 5% of the annual import quota of Chinese fisheries.
