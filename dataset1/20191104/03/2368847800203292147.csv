曾國藩的戒色經歷 欲成功者當如斯

04 Nov 2019, 03:01

一、孟子曰：「食色慾也」，好色，是人的天性。但是儒家又講「克己復禮」，在妨礙我們成功的私慾面前，要學會克制，故在「色」方面又有了「戒之在色」之說；道家在這個問題上，說：「順則人，逆則仙」，倘若順從自己的慾望，就成為凡人，反之，則能得道成仙；而在佛門中，戒邪淫更是諸大戒之一。「萬惡淫為首」，古聖先賢們苦口婆心諄諄教誨，目的就是要我們子孫後代學會「戒色」—節欲，或是戒欲，因為它事關身心健康，人生成敗，這點在此不必贅言。而我們也應該明白，好多聖賢們也曾和我們這些凡夫俗子一樣，在七情六慾中頭出頭沒，而他們最終超凡入聖，在於他們能嚴格自律，勤於修身，曾國藩就是這樣的人。
曾文正公國藩，晚清中興名臣，堪稱時代人物。他「立德立言立功」三不朽，有「千古完人」之美譽。其實，曾國藩也並非一生下來就是聖賢，就如，在情慾上，他也自認自己「喜色」，那麼，這位「千古完人」又是怎樣通過「自我修煉」最終超凡脫俗，走向成功的呢？讓我們穿越時空，跟隨下面的資料，一同去感受這位聖賢的心路歷程，並從中有所感悟。曾公有言：「人苟能立志，則聖賢豪傑何事不可為？何必藉助於人！「我欲仁，斯仁至矣。」我欲為孔孟，則日夜孜孜，惟孔孟之是學，人誰得而御我哉？若自己不立志，則雖與堯舜禹湯同住，亦彼自彼，我自我矣，何與於我哉！」讓我們都學會超越自己，從而提升自己的人生，最終做一個造福社會的人！

二、《左手曾國藩，右手胡雪岩》之第二章

曾國藩的磨礪之功（節選）
曾國藩的妻子歐陽氏身體不是很好，時常患病。一次曾國藩參加進士同學的團拜，由於所拜之家鐘鳴鼎食、姬妾如雲，這使曾國藩「大開眼界」，他的「喜色」之心油然而生，東張西望，頗失大雅。《日記》說：「是日，目屢邪視」，「恥心喪盡」，當他悻悻然回到家中後，惶然不適。加之妻子鬧病，因此「入夜心情不暢，又厭聞呻吟聲」。白天的佳麗美景與病榻上的呻吟之聲反差如此之大，使曾國藩無法忍受，乃出門到朋友處聊天，「更初歸」。次日，妻子的病有所加重，曾國藩請吳竹如來診視，由於週身為私慾所填塞，曾國藩的理學功夫大減，一聽別人談論理學，感到隔膜不入。而用宴請吃酒之事打發時光，他倒很樂意。
湯鵬是他的好友，著有《浮邱子》一書，頗得曾國藩好評。道光二十三年二月的一天，曾國藩前往湯鵬家赴喜筵，席間見湯的兩個姬人，曾國藩故伎重施，「諧謔為虐，絕無閑檢。」曾國藩早期《日記》的類似記載不限於以上幾例。這說明血氣方剛，剛過而立之年的曾國藩也有七情六慾，也是一個正常人，他對女性充滿了愛，儘管這種「愛」是在性意識支配下的形而下之「愛」，但至少從一個側面真實地反映了曾國藩的情感世界。他後來能夠大成功，就在於一改昔日所為，「截斷根緣，誓與血戰一番」。
曾國藩早年有「三大戒」，其中之一是戒色。他也認為，沉溺於此是妨礙事業的。他還認為，在外人面前，夫妻間尤不能過分親密。雖然如此，曾國藩還是很難做到，罵自己是禽獸。
曾國藩自己承認，「有用之歲月，半消磨於妻子」，三月初二日，「日中，閨房之內不敬。去歲誓戒此惡，今又犯之，可恥，可恨!竹如來，久談。久不克治，對此良友，但覺厚顏」。他說自己「明知體氣羸弱，而不知節制，不孝莫此為大」。
但隨著年齡的增長，曾國藩這方面的「不敬」很快有了大的變化，成為莊重、詼諧而不失君子形象的一個人。曾國藩就是這樣，為了能他日有所作為，嚴格限制自己的情慾，甚至夫妻之間正常的情感交流都嚴加克制。在儒家老祖宗孔孟那裡，都承認「食色，性也」，但曾國藩認為，人的私慾、情慾一旦膨脹就難以收拾，終會妨礙大事業。他以後位及人臣，但堅決不納妾，生活作風上也嚴格自律，這是他不同於同時代的封建士大夫的地方，也是他精神品格上的突出之處。
曾國藩為了實現「澄清天下之志」，針對自己的不良習慣，他提出三戒：一戒吃煙，二戒妄語，三戒房闥不敬，後來都做到了。
吸菸有害健康是今天人人皆知的常識，但吸菸對人的精神有影響，就不是人人明瞭的。曾國藩通過自己的切身感受告訴人們這樣一個道理。曾國藩認識到，應酬過多，精神就難以集中，做起事來也會出差錯。此外，吸菸也對此有很大影響。他說：精神要常令有餘，做起事來才能精氣十足而不散漫。「說話太多，吃煙太多，故致困乏。」
意識到危害後，他發誓從道光二十二年十月起戒菸，並作為「三戒」之一。但最初戒菸日子很不好過。為了打發難熬的時光，他找朋友們下棋、聊天。他在日記中寫道：「即宜守規敬事，乃閑談荒功，不溺情於弈。歸後數時，不一振刷，讀書悠忽，自棄至矣。乃以初戒吃煙，如失乳彷徨，存一番自恕底意思。此一恕，天下無可為之事矣。急宜猛省。」曾國藩把初次戒菸喻為嬰兒斷乳，形象地說明瞭他對吸菸的溺愛及戒菸的痛苦。
俗語說，玩物喪志！性格、習慣、食色之性都只要適度都是可以的，但是，人的私慾、情慾一旦膨脹就難以收拾，終會妨礙大事業，因此一個做大事的人，就應該通過不斷自勵，限制自己不恰當的慾望，而把主要心思放在自己所要從事的事業上去，以此來完善自身。
曾國藩語錄：「一分精神一分事業，十分精神十分事業。」

Zeng Guofan’s experience of coloring

04 Nov 2019, 03:01

First, Mencius said: ""The desire for food is also good,"" lascivious, is the nature of man. However, Confucianism also talks about ""self-denial and ritual"". In the face of the private desires that hinder our success, we must learn to exercise restraint. Therefore, we have the saying that ""the color is in the color"". On this issue, Taoism says: ""Shun Then, if you follow your own desires, you will become mortals. On the contrary, you will become a sin. In Buddhism, sin and sin is one of the great shackles. ""The sinister sin is the head of the sin."" The ancient sages are bitter and eager to teach, and the purpose is to learn from our children and grandchildren to ""quit the color"" - abstinence, or abstinence, because it is related to physical and mental health, people are defeated, this is no need to rumor . And we should also understand that many sages have been like the ordinary people of ours, and they are in the midst of the seven passions, and they are finally sacred, because they can be strict self-discipline and diligent in self-cultivation. Zeng Guofan is such a person.
Zeng Wenzheng was the king of the country, and the late Qing Dynasty Zhongxing was a famous figure. He is ""immortal"" and has the reputation of ""everything is perfect"". In fact, Zeng Guofan is not a sage in his life. For example, in his lust, he also believes that he is ""happy"". Then, how does this ""everyone of the ages"" finally become more successful through self-cultivation? ? Let us travel through time and space, follow the information below, and experience the journey of the saints together, and have some insights. Zeng Gong said: ""When people can make aspirations, what can the sages and heroes do? Why should we rely on people! ""I want to be benevolent, and I am willing to be jealous."" I want to be Confucius and Mencius, but day and night, but Confucius and Mencius are learning. Who can get me? If you don't make up your mind, though you live with you, you are also self-satisfied, why are you with me? Let us all learn to surpass ourselves, thus enhance our own life, and ultimately become a person who benefits the society!

Second, the second chapter of ""Left Hand Zeng Guofan, Right Hand Hu Xueyan""

Zeng Guofan's hard work (excerpt)
Zeng Guofan’s wife, Ouyang’s body, is not very good and often suffers from illness. Once Zeng Guofan participated in the group worship of the scholars, because of the worship of his family, Zhong Ming Ding, and Ji Yun Ru Yun, this made Zeng Guofan ""open his eyes"", his ""happy color"" heart came to life, and looked far and wide. ""Diary"" said: ""It is the day, the eyes and the illusion"", ""the shame is lost"", when he suddenly returned home, he was uncomfortable. In addition, his wife is ill, so ""the mood is not good at night, and he is tired of hearing."" The contrast between the beauty of the daytime and the screaming voice on the sickbed was so great that Zeng Guofan couldn't stand it. He went out to chat with friends and ""get back at the beginning."" The next day, his wife's illness was aggravated. Zeng Guofan asked Wu Zhuru to come to the clinic. Because of his personal desires, Zeng Guofan's science and martial arts were greatly reduced. Hearing others talking about science, he felt that he was not allowed to enter. He was very happy to spend his time with the banquet.
Tang Peng is his good friend and has a book called ""Floating Qiu Zi"", which is quite praised by Zeng Guofan. One day in February of the 23rd year of Daoguang, Zeng Guofan went to Tang Peng's house to go to the magpie. The two Ji people who saw the soup between the seats, Zeng Guofan's old man was re-applied. ""There is no such thing as a slap in the face."" Zeng Guofan's early diary The similar records of """" are not limited to the above examples. This shows that the bloody Fang Gang, Zeng Guofan, who just passed the year, also has seven emotions and six desires. He is also a normal person. He is full of love for women, even though this kind of ""love"" is the ""love"" under the control of sexual consciousness, but at least From one side, it truly reflects Zeng Guofan's emotional world. He was able to succeed in the past, and it was to change what he had done in the past. ""Truncate the roots and swear to fight the blood.""
Zeng Guofan had ""three major rings"" in his early years, one of which was to quit. He also believes that indulging in this is a hindrance to the cause. He also believes that in front of outsiders, couples should not be too close. Even so, Zeng Guofan is still very difficult to do, he is a beast.
Zeng Guofan himself admitted that ""the useful years, half spent on the wife"", on the second day of March, ""the Japanese and the Japanese, the shackles are disrespectful. Going to the ages to quit this evil, today committed again, shameful, hateful! Zhu Rulai, long talk Long time no cure, this good friend, but feels thick."" He said that he ""knows that his body is weak, he does not know how to control, and that he is not filial.""
However, with the increase of age, Zeng Guofan’s ""disrespect"" in this respect has quickly changed greatly, becoming a solemn, witty and unchanging image of a gentleman. This is the case with Zeng Guofan. In order to make a difference in his own passions, even the normal emotional exchanges between husband and wife are strictly restrained. In Confucius's ancestors, Confucius and Mencius, they all admit that ""food, sex,"" but Zeng Guofan believes that once the human desires and passions are inflated, it will be difficult to clean up, which will eventually hinder the cause. He was later in the position and minister, but he was determined not to be jealous, and his life style was also strictly self-disciplined. This is the place where he is different from the contemporary feudal scholars, and his outstanding character in his spiritual character.
In order to realize the ""clarification of the world"", Zeng Guofan proposed three precepts for his bad habits: one quit smoking, the second slang, and the three refusal, and later did it.
Smoking is harmful to health is a common sense that everyone knows today, but smoking has an impact on people's spirit, and it is not everyone's understanding. Zeng Guofan told people this truth through his own personal experience. Zeng Guofan realized that if there is too much entertainment, the spirit will be difficult to concentrate, and it will make mistakes when doing things. In addition, smoking has a great impact on this. He said: The spirit must be more than enough to be able to do things in order to be full of enthusiasm and not sloppy. ""Too much talk, too much smoke, so you are sleepy.""
After realizing the hazard, he vowed to quit smoking from October 22, and as one of the ""three precepts."" But the days of smoking cessation were very difficult. In order to pass the difficult time, he went to friends to play chess and chat. He wrote in his diary: ""It is advisable to obey the rules and respect the things, but to talk about the waste of the work, and not to seduce the game. When you return to the post, you don't have to brush it, read the book, and give up on it. If you lose your yin, you will have the meaning of self-forgiveness. This is a forgiveness, there is nothing in the world to worry about. It is urgent to save the province."" Zeng Guofan referred to the first stop smoking as a baby weaning, which vividly illustrates his smoking. Love and the pain of quitting smoking.
As the saying goes, playthings are lost! Characters, habits, and color of food are all appropriate as long as they are moderate. However, once a person’s lusts and passions are inflated, it is difficult to clean up and will eventually hinder a big cause. Therefore, a person who does something big should continue to encourage himself and limit himself. Improve your own self-intentional desires and focus on what you want to do.
Zeng Guofan's Quotations: ""One point is a spirit, and it is very spiritual.""
