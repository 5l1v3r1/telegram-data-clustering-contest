有「蛋糕界奧斯卡」美譽的英國「國際蛋糕節 2019」（Cake International 2019）於昨（3日）閉幕，期間出現以香港反送中為主題的參賽蛋糕，遭中國參賽者聯合舉報「港毒（獨）」，而被撤銷參賽資格。
於英國伯明罕舉辦的「國際蛋糕節2019」競賽，有一個以香港反送中為主題的蛋糕參賽，由香港一家甜點店製作報名，三層蛋糕的底座貼有便利貼象徵連儂牆，中間層是V怪客面具，旁邊則擺放幾隻彩色雨傘，還冒著煙，象徵香港警察發射催淚彈，最上層則是身穿黑衣、帶著眼罩和帽子的示威者，蛋糕上好幾處貼有字條，寫著「時代革命」「光復香港」「香港人加油」等字樣。

中國參賽者陳瑤1日在微博發文，貼出「反送中蛋糕」照片，表示她與其他4位中國選手像主辦單位舉報了「港毒」作品，她稱就算冒著被取消參賽資格的風險也在所不辭，強調「祖國利益面前，決！不！妥！協！」她更指出，以技術水平來看，這個蛋糕作品不是來拿獎的，「更像是一個政治工具」「利用國際賽事為恐怖暴力洗地不能忍」。
經中國投訴後，主辦單位認為，蛋糕主題涉及冒犯，引起其他參賽者投訴，因此決定取消參賽資格。隔天陳瑤隨即更新微博，表示在她和中國選手共同努力下，有兩個政治敏感的蛋糕都被撤展了，還翻拍兩個蛋糕被撤，只剩空蕩蕩架位的照片。

製作「反送中蛋糕」的香港選手來自上環3rd Space西式甜點店，該店昨（3日）在IG貼出作品影片及主辦單位的撤銷資格通知函，表示「今天，我們有人被捕，我們有人遠赴英國出賽被政治DQ（取消資格）。我們覺得不忿憤怒，但我們仍然會做自己，會上訴會爭取，即使最後結果不能盡如人意，但我們仍會用多一口氣告訴你，你錯了」。

During the period, the cakes with the theme of Hong Kong's reverse delivery appeared. The Chinese participants jointly reported ""Hong Kong Poison"". (exclusive), and was disqualified.
At the ""International Cake Festival 2019"" competition held in Birmingham, England, there was a cake with the theme of Hong Kong's reverse delivery. It was produced by a Hong Kong dessert shop. The base of the three-layer cake was affixed with a sticky note to symbolize the wall. The middle layer is the V geek mask, with a few colored umbrellas next to it, and it is still smoking, symbolizing the Hong Kong police launching tear gas, and the top is the demonstrators wearing black clothes, with eye masks and hats, and several cakes.

Chinese entrant Chen Yao posted a message on Weibo on the 1st, posting a photo of “Reverse Sending Cake”, saying that she and other four Chinese players reported the “Hong Kong Poison” works like the organizer, and she said that she would be disqualified even if she risked being disqualified. The risks are also in the air, emphasizing ""in front of the interests of the motherland, decisive! No! Proper! Concord!"" She also pointed out that from a technical point of view, this cake work is not to come to the prize, ""more like a political tool"" The use of international events to wash the land for terrorist violence cannot be tolerated.""
After complaints from China, the organizer believed that the theme of the cake involved offense and caused complaints from other participants, so it was decided to disqualify. The next day, Chen Yao updated Weibo, saying that with her joint efforts with Chinese players, two politically sensitive cakes were dismantled, and two cakes were remake, and only the photos of the empty shelves were left.
