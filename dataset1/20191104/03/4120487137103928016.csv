04 Nov 2019, 03:17

【中新网】当地时间11月2日，印度空间研究组织（ISRO）主席西旺表示，ISRO将再次尝试登月，目前正拟定一项行动计划。据报道，西旺在一场演讲中指出，尽管之前发射的“月船2号”探测器尝试登陆月球失败，但这并不会停止印度的登月梦想。他表示，ISRO会充分利用这次登月经验、知识和技术能力让事情往好的方向发展，并在不久的将来成功在月球实施软着陆。西旺表示，在未来几个月中，ISRO还计划发射大量的卫星升空。此外，向太阳发射探测器，送宇航员进入太空等任务都正在按计划进行。据报道，2019年9月，印度曾向月球发射“月船2号”，在绕月飞行一段时间后，登陆器“维克拉姆”于9月7日左右，试图在月球南极附近软着陆，但在最后阶段却与地球联络站失联，虽然ISRO数次尝试恢复联系，但最后仍宣告失联，导致印度的首次登月任务失败。

India says it will continue to try to land on the moon. It is preparing an action plan.

04 Nov 2019, 03:17

[Zhongxin.com] On November 2, local time, the chairman of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Xiwang, said that ISRO will try to land on the moon again and is currently working on an action plan. According to reports, Xiwang pointed out in a speech that although the ""Moonboat 2"" detector launched before failed to land on the moon, it will not stop India's dream of landing on the moon. He said that ISRO will make full use of this lunar experience, knowledge and technical ability to make things better, and will successfully implement a soft landing on the moon in the near future. Xiwang said that in the coming months, ISRO also plans to launch a large number of satellites. In addition, tasks such as launching probes to the sun and sending astronauts into space are on schedule. According to reports, in September 2019, India launched the ""Moon Ship No. 2"" to the moon. After a period of flight around the moon, the lander ""Vikram"" tried to land softly near the moon's South Pole on September 7. However, in the final stage, it lost contact with the Earth contact station. Although ISRO tried to restore contact several times, it finally declared the loss of contact, which led to the failure of India’s first mission to land on the moon.
