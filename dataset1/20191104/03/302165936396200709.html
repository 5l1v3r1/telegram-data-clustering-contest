      <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 4 — US President Donald Trump has suffered a new legal setback after a federal judge temporarily blocked a measure that would have required immigrants to prove they had health insurance or could afford medical care.</p>
      <p>US District Judge Michael Simon issued a 28-day restraining order during a rare Saturday session in his courtroom in Portland, Oregon, according to a copy of the decision seen by AFP.</p>
      <p>The new health-coverage requirement had been set to take effect today.</p>
      <p>The immigration-defence groups that had sought the injunction said the new US requirement would have been particularly onerous for low-income migrants and would unfairly favour others from wealthier countries.</p>
      <p>The White House decried the ruling.</p>
      <p>“It is wrong and unfair for a single district court judge to thwart the policies that the President determined would best protect the United States health care system,” press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The presidential proclamation of October 4 said that only immigrants who would not “financially burden the United States health care system” would be granted visas.</p>
      <p>The fight against illegal immigration has been a key pillar of Trump's policies.</p>
      <p>Several of his immigration decisions have been blocked in court.</p>
      <p>The Republican administration has regularly appealed adverse decisions to the Supreme Court, which twice this summer found in Trump's favour.</p>
      <p>But Judge Simon's 18-page ruling seemed to leave the administration with limited room to craft a dissent.</p>
      <p>He listed at least five reasons that an individual's health insurance status could not be used as the sole determiner of a person's admissibility. — AFP</p>
