【新浪网】当地时间11月1日，因附近多个邦农民焚烧农作物秸秆产生烟雾，印度首都新德里最近一个星期被笼罩在厚厚的雾霾之中。据路透社1日报道，印度政府机构公布的卫星照片显示，仅10月31日当天，印度哈里亚纳邦与旁遮普邦就有3200起焚烧秸秆事件，由此产生的有毒烟雾占到了新德里空气污染来源的44%。印度空气质量预测及研究系统的数据显示，新德里1日的整体空气质量指数已达到484，为今年来新德里空气质量最差的一天。根据指数标准，一旦指数超过400，那么当日的空气不仅会对呼吸系统患有疾病的人群产生健康风险，而且连健康人群也会受到影响。印度环境污染控制局则表示，此次空气污染十分危险，会对人的健康，尤其是儿童的健康造成影响。“我们已宣布进入公共健康紧急状态。”印度环境污染控制局说。在“公共健康紧急状态”下，新德里及其周边城市的所有建筑工地在11月5日之前都禁止施工，学校也暂时关闭。据新华社1日消息，印度有关部门在新德里全市范围内禁止燃放鞭炮，直至明年2月底。目前，已有多家印度公司建议其员工避免暴露在受到严重污染的空气中，转而在家中工作。
