      <h3>Ethereum Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In the past few sessions, Ethereum was seen trading in a range above the $178 support against the US Dollar. ETH price made a couple of attempts to start a fresh increase, but it faced a strong resistance near the $185 and $186 levels.</p>
      <p>The last swing high was near $186 before the price declined below the $182 and $180 levels. Moreover, there was a close below the $182 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. A low was formed near $179 and the price is currently correcting higher.</p>
      <p>It surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $186 high to $179 low. However, the $182 level and the 100 hourly SMA are acting as a strong hurdle for the bulls.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $186 high to $179 low is acting as a resistance. More importantly, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $182 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.</p>
      <p>Therefore, an upside break above the $182 resistance might push Ethereum price higher. On the upside, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/03/ethereum-price-weekly-forecast-eth-could-rally-again/">main resistances are near $185 and $186</a>. A clear break above $186 is needed for upside acceleration in the near term.</p>
      <p>On the downside, an immediate support is near the $180 level. If there are more downsides, the price could revisit the range support area near the $178 level. A clear break below the $178 support could spark more losses towards $175 and $170.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/">chart</a>, Ethereum price is trading in a range above the $178 support and below the $186 resistance. It may perhaps continue to trade in a range before the next move, which could be either towards the $200 barrier or the $165 support area.</p>
