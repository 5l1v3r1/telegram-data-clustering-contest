【漫畫】誰大誰惡誰正確
04 Nov 2019, 03:04 by 白水


我們想讓你知道的是公權若得不到制約？






編按：10月28日，屯門傳出不明氣體，導致區內不少市民咳嗽、呼吸困難，居民猜測是附近警察基地試射催淚彈，大批人上街要求警方交代，警方否認後隨即出動防暴警驅散，其中在一食店東屋台，防暴警強行闖入搜查，店主向警員查詢時被強行扯出店外拘捕；11月2日多區示威，有消防車被射中催淚彈，車上消防員下車向警員表達不滿，也被警員推撞包圍，事後消防處出聲明淡化事件指「純屬誤會」。
警暴問題持續受到關注，但中央政府一直力挺香港警察，警員也逐漸傾向以蒙面、不展示警員編號的方式執法，警察強硬鎮王被認定為「止暴制亂」的唯一辦法。特首林鄭早前被揭曾在商界閉門會面上，宣稱香港只有三萬警力應付群眾，「真的，我們甚麽都沒有」。

Editor's note: On October 28, unidentified gas was reported in Tuen Mun, causing many people in the district to cough and have difficulty breathing. Residents speculated that a nearby police base had fired tear gas. A large number of people went to the streets to ask the police to explain, and the police denied the riot police immediately. Dispersed, in one restaurant Dongwutai, anti-riot police forcibly entered the search, the owner was forcibly pulled out of the store when inquiring to the police officers; on November 2, multi-zone demonstrations, fire trucks were shot in tear gas, the firefighters got off Dissatisfied with the police officers, but also surrounded by police officers, after the fire department issued a statement to downplay refers to ""pure misunderstanding.""
The issue of police violence continues to receive attention, but the central government has always been able to support the Hong Kong police. Police officers have gradually become more law-abiding in the form of masked and not showing the number of police officers. The only way for the police to be a hard-line king is to ""stop the storm."" . Chief Executive Lin Zheng was exposed earlier in the closed meeting of the business community, claiming that there are only 30,000 police officers in Hong Kong to cope with the masses. ""Really, we have nothing.""
