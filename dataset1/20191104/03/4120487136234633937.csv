韩国失事直升机今被打捞出水 未发现失踪者

04 Nov 2019, 03:20

【新浪网】当地时间10月31日下午11时25分许，一架载有7人的消防直升机从独岛起飞后坠海，目前共打捞起2具遗体。据韩联社最新消息，韩国搜救部门11月3日表示，失事直升机残骸已于当天下午被打捞出水，但机内并未发现失踪人员，5人下落不明。搜救部门2日曾表示，共发现3具遗体，其中在附近海域发现的两具遗体已被打捞出水，但由于空间狭窄等原因，潜水员未能成功打捞机身内部的另一具遗体。由此，搜救部门当天先将机身残骸从水深78米处移至25米处的安全海域，随后又将其打捞至“清海镇”号舰艇上，以便进一步搜寻。对于机身内部是否有遗体一事，搜救部门表示，由于水下难以清晰辨识，有关部门将进一步调查究竟是潜水艇识别有误还是在打捞过程中发生了流失，并将进一步搜寻其他失踪者。

South Korea’s wrecked helicopter was salvaged today. No missing persons were found.

04 Nov 2019, 03:20

[Sina.com] At 11:25 pm local time on October 31, a firefighting helicopter carrying seven people crashed from Dokdo and crashed into the sea. At present, two bodies were recovered. According to the latest news from the Yonhap News Agency, the South Korean search and rescue department said on November 3 that the wreckage of the wrecked helicopter had been salvaged in the afternoon, but no missing persons were found inside the aircraft, and the whereabouts of five people were unknown. The search and rescue department said on the 2nd that three bodies were found, of which two bodies found in the nearby waters have been salvaged, but due to the narrow space, the divers failed to salvage another body inside the fuselage. As a result, the search and rescue department first moved the wreckage of the fuselage from the depth of 78 meters to the safe waters of 25 meters, and then salvaged it to the ""Qinghai Town"" ship for further search. Regarding whether there is a body inside the fuselage, the search and rescue department said that because the underwater is difficult to identify clearly, the relevant departments will further investigate whether the submarine is misidentified or lost during the salvage process, and will further search for other missing persons.
