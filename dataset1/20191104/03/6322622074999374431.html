      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 4): Malaysia has rejected an offer from Goldman Sachs of less than US$2 billion in compensation over the 1MDB scandal, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad told the <i>Financial Times</i> on Friday, compared with its publicly stated demand of US$7.5 billion.</p>
      <p>The Southeast Asian nation has charged Goldman and 17 current and former directors of its units for allegedly misleading investors over bond sales totalling US$6.5 billion that the US bank helped raise for sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).</p>
      <p>"Goldman Sachs has offered something like less than US$2 billion,” Dr Mahathir told the newspaper. "We are not satisfied with that amount so we are still talking to them... If they respond reasonably we might not insist on getting that US$7.5 billion".</p>
      <p>Goldman declined to comment to the <i>FT</i>. The bank did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Goldman said last month it was in discussions with authorities on the possibility of a resolution of investigations relating to 1MDB.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Dr Mahathir travelling with the leader could not immediately be reached.</p>
      <p>US authorities say about US$4.5 billion was siphoned from 1MDB, founded in 2009 by then-Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak. The scandal helped Dr Mahathir hand a surprise defeat to Najib in a general election last year.</p>
      <p>Dr Mahathir told the <i>FT </i>the Southeast Asian country was not negotiating or in contact with fugitive financier Jho Low, accused of playing a central role in the scam.</p>
      <p>Low has consistently denied wrongdoing and says he does not expect a fair trial in Malaysia as long as Dr Mahathir is in power.</p>
      <p>The US Justice Department said this week it had struck a deal to recover US$1 billion in funds allegedly looted from 1MDB from Low, in a record haul for a US anti-corruption probe.</p>
      <p>The deal does not include an admission of guilt or wrongdoing and is not tied to criminal action against Low.</p>
      <p>Dr Mahathir said on Thursday Malaysia would file a claim on Low's forfeited assets.</p>
      <p>"The DoJ has indicated that if we can prove claim of ownership, then we will be able to get the money for ourselves," Dr Mahathir told the <i>FT</i>.</p>
