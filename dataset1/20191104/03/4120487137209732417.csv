新税务局长 面临各种严峻挑战

04 Nov 2019, 03:34

佐科威总统选出一位新人担任税务局长，现在该新税务局长已开始工作。然而，鉴于国家预算需要的资金越来越多，许多人都意识到新税务局长将面临十分严峻的挑战，另一方面，征税也越来越困难。财政部长丝莉（Sri Mulyani Indrawati）在为新任税务局长苏里约乌托莫（Suryo Utomo）举行就职典礼时强调，税务局长的职责很重。大约70%的国家预算（APBN）来自税务总局（DJP）。她说：“税务局长的任务非常重要，但我需要提醒，我们在印尼发展前进的主题目标中工作，共同面对挑战。”印尼税务分析中心（CITA）执行主任尤斯蒂努斯（Yustinus Prastowo）评估，税务局长的主要任务是确保税务总局达致税收目标。近五年来，税收收入的实现始终没有达到预期目标。以2014年为例，税收实现率为目标的91.85%。一年后，实现率降至目标的81.9%。2016年为81.6%，2017年为89.68%，2018年为92.41%。尤斯蒂努斯认为，税务局长必须有勇气改进目前还不理想的税收做法。例如，管理不统一，实地执行不一致。这种改进最终将增加纳税人的信任。尤斯蒂努斯于10月31日对CNNIndonesia.com说：“有必要与利益相关者建立协同效应，特别是与税收政策和实践相关的协调和良好沟通。”。与此同时，经济和金融发展研究机构（INDEF）的经济学家Eko Listiyanto评估说，税务总局需要一位工作多于言谈的税务局长。他说税务局局长须能掌握指挥权，才能在机构内部继续进行改革。比如，在完善行政管理和社会化制度方面。若能这样做，必然会增加纳税人对税务局的信任，并将与纳税遵从度成正相关。他说：“我敢肯定，纳税人并非想不纳税，而是需要方便的设施。”在经济放缓之际，税收已经成为政府用来刺激经济的一种工具。也就是说，税务局长要能够制定一项创新政策，而不仅仅是提高税率和向同样的纳税人征税。税务应能够成为政府推动经济增长大战略的一部分。税务总局还要完成的三项主要功课，首先是必须能够提高在过去五年中停留在11%范围内的税率；其次，必须能够向谷歌（Google）等在线公司征税；第三，必须有敏锐的观察力发现纳税人为避税而置于海外的资金的潜力。税务与海关研究机构（LKPK）还要求政府认真研究数字经济领域的税收问题。因为，在Netflix和谷歌等数字产业产品的发展趋势中，它们在我国的交易额逐年增加。但我国的征税工作尚未达到最优程度。税务与海关研究机构董事会主席苏西解释说，我国人民对数字技术的兴趣相当大，仅在2016年期间，该机构就录得有多达7600万我国人积极使用脸书（Facebook）。他在2019年11月1日于雅加达西部的Tarumanagara大学举办的焦点小组讨论（Focus Group Discussion）中说：“使用人数在世界上排名第四，在使用推特（Twitter）上雅加达同样也是全球最活跃的城市，它对我国经济的影响不可小觑。数字经济对国民生产总值的贡献率从2005年的2.5%增长到2015年的7.2%。”苏西继续说，这一现象表明，我国越来越多地被纳入数字国际协会。在这种背景下，他认为对数字经济征税是4.0数字工业革命的后果之一。但是，目前税务局对数字产业的业务流程认识得还不够全面，因此仍然无法对像Netflix和谷歌这样的公司征税。因此我们保持乐观，因为我国的税收潜力仍然很大，只是政府未能有效和最佳地管理它。但我们需要提醒政府，在征税方面务须谨慎透明，不要为追逐目标而盲目行动，因会让纳税人感到害怕，从而对未来面临严峻挑战的商业活动产生反作用。

The new tax director faces various serious challenges

04 Nov 2019, 03:34

President Zuckwey elected a new person to serve as the tax director, and now the new tax director has begun work. However, given the increasing amount of funds required by the state budget, many people are aware that the new tax director will face very serious challenges. On the other hand, taxation is becoming more and more difficult. Treasury Secretary Sri Mulyani Indrawati stressed the inauguration of the new tax director, Suryo Utomo, that the duties of the tax director are heavy. About 70% of the national budget (APBN) comes from the General Tax Administration (DJP). She said: ""The task of the Tax Director is very important, but I need to remind you that we work in the theme of the development of Indonesia and face the challenges together."" Indonesian Tax Analysis Center (CITA) Executive Director Ustinus Prastowo The assessment, the main task of the tax director is to ensure that the tax administration achieves the tax target. In the past five years, the realization of tax revenue has not achieved the expected goal. Take 2014 as an example, the tax achievement rate is 91.85% of the target. A year later, the implementation rate fell to 81.9% of the target. In 2016, it was 81.6%, in 2017 it was 89.68%, and in 2018 it was 92.41%. Ustinus believes that the tax director must have the courage to improve the current unsatisfactory tax practices. For example, management is not uniform and implementation in the field is inconsistent. This improvement will ultimately increase the trust of taxpayers. On October 31, Ustinus told CNNIndonesia.com: “It is necessary to establish synergies with stakeholders, especially coordination and good communication related to tax policies and practices.”. At the same time, Eko Listiyanto, an economist at the Institute for Economic and Financial Development (INDEF), said that the SAT needs a tax director who works more than talks. He said that the head of the tax bureau must be able to master the command and continue to carry out reforms within the organization. For example, in improving administrative management and socialization systems. If this can be done, it will inevitably increase the taxpayer's trust in the tax bureau and will be positively related to tax compliance. He said: ""I am sure that taxpayers do not want to pay taxes, but need convenient facilities."" At a time of economic slowdown, taxation has become a tool used by the government to stimulate the economy. In other words, the tax director should be able to develop an innovative policy, not just to raise the tax rate and tax the same taxpayer. Taxation should be part of the government's strategy to drive economic growth. The three major tasks that the SAT has to complete must first be able to increase the tax rate of 11% in the past five years. Second, it must be able to tax online companies such as Google. Third, there must be A keen observation reveals the potential of taxpayers to place funds overseas for tax avoidance. The Tax and Customs Research Institute (LKPK) also asked the government to seriously study tax issues in the digital economy. Because, in the development trend of digital industry products such as Netflix and Google, their transaction volume in China has increased year by year. However, China’s taxation work has not yet reached an optimal level. Su Xi, chairman of the board of directors of the tax and customs research institute, explained that the people of our country are interested in digital technology. In 2016 alone, the agency recorded as many as 76 million Chinese people actively using Facebook. In the Focus Group Discussion held at the Tarumanagara University in western Jakarta on November 1, 2019, he said: ""The number of users is ranked fourth in the world. Jakarta is also the world's most on Twitter. An active city, its impact on China’s economy cannot be underestimated. The contribution rate of the digital economy to the gross national product has increased from 2.5% in 2005 to 7.2% in 2015.” Susie continued, this phenomenon indicates that China More and more are being incorporated into the Digital International Association. In this context, he believes that taxing the digital economy is one of the consequences of the 4.0 digital industrial revolution. However, the current tax bureau is not fully aware of the business processes of the digital industry, so it is still not possible to tax companies like Netflix and Google. Therefore, we remain optimistic because our tax revenue potential is still great, but the government has failed to manage it effectively and optimally. However, we need to remind the government that we must be cautious and transparent in taxation. We should not blindly pursue the pursuit of the target, because it will make taxpayers feel scared and thus have a negative impact on business activities that face serious challenges in the future.
