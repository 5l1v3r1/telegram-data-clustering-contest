拒色與貪色的果報（1）

04 Nov 2019, 03:11

古語云「做事須循天理」、「欲廣福田，須憑心地」，指人做事要按天理而行；要使自己的福運廣大，就要修自己這顆心。古人認為，行善以積德為上，積德又以護生及不淫為上。
《文昌帝君陰騭文》說：「貪好色慾、行為不正之人，污損了自己善良本性和名節，違逆了天理，是要受到懲罰的。上天常降禍給這樣的人，報應非常快。倘若有人不怕報應，對自己的邪行依然不加檢點改過，則此人隨時都會遭受災殃的降臨。蒼天的降福恩澤，只有潔身好德、守身如玉的人，才可能得此福報。」
自古以來，能戒色者必得福。而貪色縱慾、禍亂常道之事，足以傷陰德、削損犯者的前程，一有此心，雖未行其事，就已是罪過；實犯者，非僅己身必有災禍，且殃及子孫，由此而快速削減福祿者有之，由此而破家者有之，由此而奪命者有之，或是命中本該富貴尊榮，因而貧困潦倒終生；或是命中本是壽山福海，卻遭禍殃而夭亡。因一切逾矩敗節、悖逆天道的行為，都是天地所難容的，怎麼能不令人警惕戒備呢？古籍中記載的這類事例很多，以下舉幾個例子。

（一）拒色得福

北宋時江西信州人林茂先，才學過人，家裏十分貧窮，便自己閉門讀書。得到鄉薦後，有一鄰家富人之婦，嫌棄自己的丈夫沒有學問，私慕林茂先的才名，就於某夜私奔到他家。林茂先嚴肅說道：「男女有別，禮法不容，天地鬼神，羅列森布，你怎能玷污我的品行呢？」婦人聽後慚愧而退。
第二年是北宋天聖八年，林茂先考取了進士，因才華橫溢，功勛卓著而被朝廷重用，在京城擔任太常卿，官居二品。後來他的四個兒子均考取進士，獲得「一門五進士」的稱譽，可謂一門榮貴。
《中庸》一開端，就說君子要「慎獨」，所謂慎獨即是說君子在別人看不見的地方也不要做非禮之事；評論小人時，則說他們「無所忌憚」。可見修身要務，實在敬畏二字。「男女有別，禮法不容」，敬也；「天地鬼神，羅列森布」，畏也，可見林茂先平素修養之深。
古人敬天敬神，君子即使身在暗室亦知有神明監察，神目如電，不敢放縱自己的慾念，能把持住自己，修善積福，上天佑護，人神共欽。小人不信因果，則是肆無忌憚，認為做壞事隱蔽沒人知道，殊不知可以瞞過人，但瞞不過天地神明，造下種種罪業，天地神明都會憤怒。

Rejection and greed (1)

04 Nov 2019, 03:11

In the old saying, ""doing things through the heavens"" and ""shelving the Futian, you must rely on the heart"" means that people should do things according to the principles of heaven; to make their own good fortune, they must cultivate their own hearts. The ancients believed that the good deeds were based on the virtues, and the virtues were based on nursing and non-obscenity.
""Wenchang Emperor Yin Yin Wen"" said: ""The people who are greedy and ill-willed, misbehaving, deface their own good nature and famous festivals, and violate the heavenly principles. They are to be punished. Heaven often causes disasters to such people, and the retribution is very If someone is not afraid of retribution, and still does not check the evils of their own, then this person will suffer the disaster at any time. The heavenly blessing of grace, only the person who is clean and good, and who keeps himself like jade, may get this blessing. .""
Since ancient times, people who can quit are blessed. The greed of indulgence and the harassment of the sinfulness is enough to hurt the yin and detract from the future of the offender. If there is such a heart, it is already a sin if it is not done; the actual offender must have a disaster, and he And the descendants, and thus the rapid reduction of the Phlox, and thus the home-breakers have it, and thus the death-seekers have it, or the life should be rich and honored, so that poverty will last for life; or hit this It was Shoushan Fuhai, but it was ruined and killed. Because all acts that are ruined and disobedient, and that are rebellious against heaven, are all difficult in heaven and earth. How can we not be alert? There are many such examples recorded in ancient books, to name a few.

(1) Refusing to be blessed

In the Northern Song Dynasty, Lin Maoxian, a native of Xinzhou, Jiangxi, had studied and was very poor. He closed his door to study. After receiving the township recommendation, there was a woman who was next to the rich man. She dismissed her husband without learning, and admired the name of Lin Maoxian, and rushed to his home at night. Lin Maoxian said seriously: ""There are differences between men and women, the law and the law are not allowed, the gods and the gods, and the column of the gods, and the world, how can you defile my character?"" The woman retreated.
The second year was the Eighth Year of the Northern Song Dynasty. Lin Maoxian took the Jinshi, and was used by the court for his outstanding talents and outstanding merits. He served as the Taichangqing and the official residence in Beijing. Later, his four sons were all admitted to the scholarship and earned the honor of ""one five-member scholar"".
At the beginning of ""The Doctrine of the Mean"", it is said that gentlemen must be ""cautiously independent."" The so-called cautiousness means that gentlemen do not do indecent things in places that others cannot see. When commenting on villains, they say that they are ""nothing to fear."" It can be seen that the self-cultivation is a matter of awe. ""Men and women are different, the law and the law are not allowed"", respect also; ""the gods of the heavens and the earth, Luo Lisenbu"", fear also, can be seen in Lin Maoxian's level of cultivation.
The ancients respected the gods and worshipped the gods. Even if they were in the darkroom, they knew that there was a god-monitoring. The gods were like electricity. They dared not indulge their own desires. They could hold themselves, repair the good fortune, and protect the gods. If a villain does not believe in cause and effect, he is unscrupulous. He believes that no one knows what to do with bad things. He does not know that he can marry anyone, but he can’t be blamed for the sinfulness of the heavens and the earth.
