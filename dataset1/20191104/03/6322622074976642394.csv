04 Nov 2019, 03:53 by Wong Swee May
（吉隆坡4日讯）Prestariang Bhd今早最高上扬3仙或5.83%，至54.5仙，因高庭上周驳回政府将Prestariang Skin私人有限公司的原诉传票转为传讯令状的申请。
Prestariang向大马交易所报备，高庭的裁决为法庭现在裁定政府应向Prestariang Skin支付多少赔偿金，以终止先前批准的35亿令吉特许协议铺路。
截至11时35分，该股报53仙，达3777万5300股成交，是第五大热门股。

Gao Ting dismissed government application Prestariang rallied
04 Nov 2019, 03:53 by Wong Swee May
KUALA LUMPUR (April 4): Prestariang Bhd rose 3 sen or 5.83% to 54.5 sen this morning, as Gao Ting rejected last week's application to convert the original voucher of Prestariang Skin Sdn Bhd into a writ of summons.
Prestariang reported to the Bursa Malaysian exchange that Gao Ting’s ruling is that the court now decides how much compensation the government should pay to Prestariang Skin to pave the way for the termination of the previously approved RM3.5 billion franchise agreement.
As of 11:35, the stock reported 53 cents, reaching 37.75 million 5300 shares, the fifth largest stock.
