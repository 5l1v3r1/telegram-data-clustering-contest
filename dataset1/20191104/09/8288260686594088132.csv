Volunteers have been left devastated after they found unwanted belongings fly tipped across graves in a Walsall churchyard.
Trash has been strewn around a churchyard on Walsall Street Willenhall, on Thursday, October 31.
Volunteers, who tend to the graves so families can visit their loved ones, were disgusted to find the mess left behind.
Shocking pictures and footage obtained by Black Country Live show the clothes plastered across the graves, churchyard and neighbouring alleyway.

Items such as children's clothing, shoes and hair extensions were abandoned and thrown over walls and fences.
Sadie Pritchard Sargeant, who works hard to keep the churchyard looking presentable, told Black Country Live: ""It’s heartbreaking as we are working so hard on the church yard to get the yard ready for Remembrance Day and to maintain the yard in general.
""Throughout the years the maintenance has been hard to uptake as it’s a big area and this yesterday stopped me from doing any graves that I was there to do.""
Speaking about where she thinks the clothes came from, Sadie said: ""It looks as though it’s been dumped by one party then another has come along, seen it and rummaged through it and thrown the stuff every where as the bags where all torn open.

""They have been taken by the council. I did think at first they could have been donated, but there was a lot of stained clothes amongst them and I had to wear gloves to bag them as you can’t be sure what’s amongst them.""
The 36-year-old added: ""We are very appreciative of any help we can get, we always need volunteers to help, we do have a few people chipping in now but it’s such a big piece of land and with us going on our days off etc we’re limited to how much we can get covered.
""Everyone who’s helping comes down as often as they can. I get down once a week but hopefully weather permitting next week it will be more.
""We really need to get as much done as possible for Remembrance Day, but even after that the maintenance needs upkeep all year round.
""If we can get more people to just do a couple hours a week it will all add up.""
