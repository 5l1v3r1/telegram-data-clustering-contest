香港不是孤軍奮戰《啟示錄》預言中共末日

04 Nov 2019, 09:52

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】中共四中全會後，港府再度升級鎮壓抗爭者的力度，這場持續了5個月的「水革命」流向何方，似乎看不到方向。但有香港大律師表示，港人不是孤軍奮戰，「國際戰線」要拉開。而《香港啟示錄》中預言，中共可能因香港問題走向末日。
11月4日，香港公民黨主席、資深大律師梁家傑在VOA《香港風雲》節目中表示，香港高等法院10月31日頒發臨時網絡言論禁制令難以執行、存在灰色地帶，有可能是網禁的第一步，亦有可能是刻意營造白色恐怖及寒蟬效應。
兩岸趨勢專家範疇認為，虽然全面禁網在香港不可能做到，但可為港府逮捕抗爭者製造口實。他說，香港問題和平解決的臨界點已經過了。隨著北京越來越強化，美國那邊應該會在11月24日選舉前推出香港人權法案。他認為，美國不會放棄香港，因為香港對美國是直接利益所在，而且也代表整個西方世界民主自由法制面子。
範疇認為，港人的這場抗爭已經國際化了，港民別無選擇了，既然走到這一步了，港人就要擔起國際公民的責任。
他表示，中共是人類的新物種，無法用理念性的或是國際壓力來對付它。因為國際壓力大，它會退一步，但過幾年它又來了，永遠沒完沒了。

範疇最近在《香港啟示錄》嚴格區分中共和中國，他說「中共可能會因為收回香港而沒落」，但是「中國可能會因為收復香港而重生」。
如果鄧小平當年同意了撒切爾夫人的分割法，主權歸中共，制權歸英國，也許中共可以比較緩慢地用香港達到它崛起的目的。但中共用了「一國兩制」，這使得它在20年內就把香港的信用運用殆盡。
範疇說，香港國際金融中心完全靠信任，整個中國的經濟是依賴香港。香港的經濟金融中心地位垮掉的話，整個中國經濟非垮不可。因為中共不懂得be water的意義，用傳統的強力對付香港，勢必引起美國等採取某些動作，這個事件可能會升級到超越港人所能夠控制的階段，大家不得不防。
梁家傑表示，香港不是孤軍奮戰，「國際戰線」要拉開。
他說，這兩個星期他在訪問法國、英國、歐盟時，都和他們說，現在港人做的是自由人權法制、生活方式的保衛戰，絕對不是港人孤獨的、單獨的作戰。
香港是屬於自由民主模式陣型的一員，中共則向全世界推銷中共模式，但中共是獨裁政權，只搞經濟完全不允許人民享有自由法制，還用人臉辨識等高科技駕馭人民。
如果香港在這一場保衛戰中打輸了，不僅僅是香港輸了，而是自由民主陣型退的一大步，也是中共向全世界推銷中共模式的進一步。所以他對歐洲朋友說，你們不僅是在幫香港打這場保衛戰，也是在幫自己捍衛自由人權法制和生活方式。
梁家傑表示，在香港這場持續多月的「水革命」當中，港人有不可推卸的責任，就是在世界上打好自由人權法制、生活方式的保衛戰。現在港人已經充當這個角色了，不忘初衷，也不會放棄。當然也希望世界上自由民主的國家給予香港人支持。

Hong Kong is not alone, ""Revelation"" predicts the end of the Chinese Communist Party

04 Nov 2019, 09:52

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party, the Hong Kong Government renewed its efforts to suppress the protesters. It seems that the ""water revolution"" that lasted for five months has not seen the direction. However, some Hong Kong barristers said that the people of Hong Kong are not alone, and the ""international front"" is to be opened. The ""Hong Kong Revelation"" prophesies that the CCP may go to the end of the day because of the Hong Kong issue.
On November 4th, Hong Kong Citizens Party Chairman and Senior Counsel Liang Jiajie said in the VOA ""Hong Kong Fengyun"" program that the Hong Kong High Court issued a temporary online speech prohibition order on October 31. It is difficult to implement, there is a gray area, and it may be banned. In the first step, it is also possible to deliberately create a white terror and chilling effect.
The cross-strait trend experts believe that although the comprehensive ban can not be done in Hong Kong, it can create a false impression for the Hong Kong government to arrest the protesters. He said that the critical point for the peaceful settlement of the Hong Kong issue has passed. As Beijing becomes more and more intensive, the US side should launch the Hong Kong Bill of Rights before the November 24 election. He believes that the United States will not give up Hong Kong because Hong Kong is directly interested in the United States, and it also represents the entire Western world's democratic and free legal system.
The category believes that the Hong Kong people’s struggle has become internationalized, and the people of Hong Kong have no choice. Since this step has taken place, the people of Hong Kong must assume the responsibility of international citizens.
He said that the CCP is a new species of human beings and cannot deal with it with conceptual or international pressure. Because of the international pressure, it will take a step back, but in a few years it has come again, and it will never end.

The category has recently distinguished Hong Kong and China strictly in ""Hong Kong Revelation"". He said that ""the CCP may fall because of the recovery of Hong Kong"", but ""China may be born again because of the recovery of Hong Kong.""
If Deng Xiaoping agreed with Mrs. Thatcher’s division law, sovereignty belonged to the CCP, and power was returned to the United Kingdom, perhaps the CCP could use Hong Kong to achieve its rising purpose more slowly. However, the sharing of ""one country, two systems"" has made it possible to use Hong Kong's credit within 20 years.
According to the category, the Hong Kong International Finance Centre relies entirely on trust and the entire Chinese economy is dependent on Hong Kong. If the status of Hong Kong's economic and financial center is lost, the entire Chinese economy is indispensable. Because the CCP does not understand the meaning of be water, using traditional power to deal with Hong Kong is bound to cause certain actions by the United States, etc. This event may escalate beyond the stage that the people of Hong Kong can control, and everyone has to guard against it.
Liang Jiajie said that Hong Kong is not alone, and the ""international front"" is to be opened.
He said that during his visit to France, the United Kingdom and the European Union these two weeks, he said to them that Hong Kong people are now fighting for a free human rights legal system and a way of life. It is definitely not a lonely, separate operation of Hong Kong people.
Hong Kong is a member of the liberal democratic model. The CCP sells the CCP model to the whole world. However, the CCP is a dictatorship. The economy alone does not allow people to enjoy the free legal system. It also uses high-tech such as face recognition to control the people.
If Hong Kong loses in this battle, it is not only Hong Kong's loss, but a major step forward in the liberal democratic formation. It is also a further step in the CCP's promotion of the CCP model to the world. So he told European friends that you are not only helping Hong Kong fight this defense, but also helping yourself defend the legal and lifestyle of freedom and human rights.
Mr Leung said that in Hong Kong's ""water revolution"" that lasted for many months, Hong Kong people have an unshirkable responsibility to lay a solid defense of the legal system of free human rights and the way of life in the world. Now that the people of Hong Kong have already played this role, they will not forget the original intention and will not give up. Of course, I also hope that the free and democratic countries in the world will give support to Hong Kong people.
