章家敦：中共是21世紀納粹 美國須全方位脫鉤

04 Nov 2019, 09:15

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】美中雙方正在推動簽署第一階段貿易協議，但美國著名評論家暨中國問題專家章家敦（Gordon Chang）認為，協議不會改變中共竊取知識產權、輸出其專制影響力的企圖。他指出，中共是「21世紀的納粹德國」，美國必須全方位與中共脫鉤，以維持世界強權的地位。
章家敦在廣播節目中接受主持人卡特（Sara Carter）專訪時表示，中共正在對全球輸出其專制政權影響力，「它是21世紀的納粹德國。」
他談到，中共目前正在做的事情，包括對少數族裔和宗教團體的迫害，是絕對令人難以接受的。
章家敦說，中共的制度與美國不相容，如果美國欲維持其世界強權的地位，就必須全方位地與中共脫鉤，否則將面臨中共可能改變全世界地緣政治結構的巨大風險。
幾天前，美國國務卿蓬佩奧（Mike Pompeo）10月30日在智庫哈德遜研究所（Hudson Institute）的演說中也指出，中共的舉措與美國的制度並不相容。
蓬佩奧說，「今天，我們終於認識到中國共產黨真正敵視美國和我們的價值觀的程度，以及它的更惡劣言行和對我們的影響。我們能夠做到這點是因為有川普總統的領導。」
章家敦認同蓬佩奧的說法，他說：「很不幸，我們將必須改變方向，與中共脫鉤，以保護我們自己，並減少我們面對一個極端危險的角色的弱點。」
他還提到，美國最終必須讓其公司離開中國、讓中共離開美國，藉此與中共脫鉤。
目前，美中雙方正計劃簽署第一階段貿易協議，但簽署時間和地點尚未確定。章家敦對此並不看好，他不相信這個所謂的第一階段貿易協議，能抑制中共軍方與情報機構竊取美國的知識產權，以及改變中共對全球進行經濟控制的企圖。
「中共每年一直竊取數千億美元的美國知識產權。我不認為我們能以第一階段貿易協議來阻止它。」他說：「所以，讓我們的公司離開中國。那將能立即減少他們從我們這裡偷竊的機會。」
章家敦認為，川普政府必須「持續加征高額關稅」打擊中共，並最終與中共脫鉤。
他此前還在推文中表示，中共擅長撒謊、作弊和偷竊，美國唯一不受傷害的方法，就是與其脫鈎。
除了貿易戰，香港的反送中運動已成為美中較量的一個新戰場。章家敦曾前往香港考察反送中運動，9月25日，他在《華爾街日報》上撰文說，當前香港民眾的抗爭活動，很可能會促成中共政權瓦解。
章家敦在文章中稱，賓夕法尼亞大學中國歷史學家亞瑟·沃爾德隆（Arthur Waldron）上個月對我說：「中共正在瓦解。」
章家敦表示，香港的現狀是，中共當局已處於劣勢，廣大香港居民堅決反對中共的侵略，他們的抗爭目標從反對「送中條例」到反對中共本身，他們要爭取「一國兩制」中的「高度自治」權利。
他還指出，中共暗示美國必須接受其正在境內施行的群體滅絕行動，不要改變政策或干涉該政權對人權的侵犯，這是無法令人接受的。
章家敦是美國律師、作家、電視評論家，以其著作《中國即將崩潰》一書（2001年）而知名。

Zhang Jiadun: The CCP is a Nazi in the 21st century.

04 Nov 2019, 09:15

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] The United States and China are promoting the signing of the first phase of the trade agreement, but the famous American critic and Chinese expert Gordon Chang believes that the agreement will not change the CCP’s theft of intellectual property rights. And the attempt to export its authoritarian influence. He pointed out that the CCP is ""Nazi Germany in the 21st century."" The United States must decouple from the CCP in all aspects to maintain its status as a world power.
In an exclusive interview with the host Sara Carter on the radio show, Zhang Jiadun said that the CCP is exporting its influence to the authoritarian regime globally. ""It is Nazi Germany in the 21st century.""
He said that what the CCP is doing now, including persecution of ethnic minorities and religious groups, is absolutely unacceptable.
Zhang Jiadun said that the CCP's system is incompatible with the United States. If the United States wants to maintain its status as a world power, it must decouple from the CCP in all directions. Otherwise, it will face enormous risks that the CCP may change the geopolitical structure of the world.
A few days ago, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also pointed out in a speech at the Hudson Institute on October 30 that the CCP’s move was incompatible with the US system.
Pompeo said, ""Today, we finally realize the extent to which the Chinese Communist Party is truly hostile to the United States and our values, as well as its worse words and deeds and influence on us. We can do this because of the leadership of President Trump. ""
Zhang Jiadun agrees with Pompeo that he said: ""Unfortunately, we will have to change direction and decouple from the CCP to protect ourselves and reduce our weakness in the face of an extremely dangerous role.""
He also mentioned that the United States must eventually let its company leave China and let the CCP leave the United States to decouple it from the CCP.
Currently, the US and China are planning to sign the first phase of the trade agreement, but the time and place of signing have not yet been determined. Zhang Jiadun is not optimistic about this. He does not believe that the so-called first-stage trade agreement can restrain the Chinese military and intelligence agencies from stealing US intellectual property rights and change the CCP's attempt to control the economy globally.
""The CCP has been stealing hundreds of billions of US intellectual property rights every year. I don't think we can stop it with the first phase of the trade agreement."" He said: ""So, let our company leave China. That will immediately reduce their The opportunity for us to steal here.""
Zhang Jiadun believes that the Trump administration must ""continue to impose high tariffs"" against the CCP and eventually decouple from the CCP.
He also said in his tweet that the CCP is good at lying, cheating and stealing. The only way for the United States to be harmless is to decouple it.
In addition to the trade war, Hong Kong's anti-send campaign has become a new battlefield for the US-China contest. Zhang Jiadun went to Hong Kong to inspect the anti-delivery movement. On September 25, he wrote in the ""Wall Street Journal"" that the current protests by the people of Hong Kong are likely to lead to the collapse of the Chinese Communist regime.
Zhang Jiadun said in the article that Arthur Waldron, a Chinese historian at the University of Pennsylvania, said to me last month: ""The CCP is disintegrating.""
Zhang Jiadun said that the status quo in Hong Kong is that the Chinese authorities are at a disadvantage. The Hong Kong residents are resolutely opposed to the CCP's aggression. Their target of resistance is from opposing the ""Send the Ordinance"" to opposing the CCP itself. They must strive for ""one country, two systems"". A high degree of autonomy.
He also pointed out that the CCP implied that the United States must accept the genocidal actions it is carrying out in the country, and not change its policies or interfere with the violation of human rights by the regime. This is unacceptable.
Zhang Jiadun is an American lawyer, writer, and television critic, known for his book ""China is about to collapse"" (2001).
