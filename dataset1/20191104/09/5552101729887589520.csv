與郭書瑤映後讀繪本　藍正龍驚「現在小孩很早熟」
04 Nov 2019, 09:04 by 娛樂組
藍正龍執導電影《傻傻愛你，傻傻愛我》，台北市票房創下約207萬新台幣。女主角郭書瑤與新北市政府合作，邀請弱勢家庭前進樹林秀泰影城觀賞電影，還與導演藍正龍一起擔任一日店長，唸繪本《猜猜我有多愛》給小朋友聽。
郭書瑤本來就有可愛童音，唸起繪本得心應手，而藍正龍雖然外表總是酷酷的，但已是二個小孩的爸爸，對於唸童書很有一套，現場裝起娃娃聲扮演書中的大白兔，還配上身體動作，也讓所有所有小朋友聽得入迷。
在電影放映結束後的發問時間，現場許多小朋友有很多問題想請教導演，小朋友們的問題都天馬行空充滿童真，讓郭書瑤和藍正龍都覺得非常有趣。有小女孩瞪著大眼睛問瑤瑤說：「美人魚，為什麼你現在會走路？」逗得全場笑哈哈，讓瑤瑤也開心的回應：「因為我是一隻有腿的美人魚喔！」還有小朋友問她：「你為什麼這麼美？」更讓她開心不已的回說：「你們也都很漂亮啊！」
也有很早熟的小朋友問導演藍正龍說，電影有瑤瑤扮演的援交妹接客的畫面，但電影為什麼是普級？藍正龍也認真解釋，級數審查是以裸露及意識大膽程度，但片中的接客畫面並沒有任何裸露，但提問的小妹妹表示看到畫面還是覺得很害羞。還有小朋友專業提問：「導演為什麼設定瑤瑤的角色是妓女？」讓藍正龍好奇他是幾歲，認為現在小孩心智都很早熟，真的都明白電影所說的事情。
小朋友還好奇，藍正龍在片中被恬妞用錢砸臉是什麼感受，讓他笑著回答：「是用假鈔砸的，所以很痛。」此外本片的真正男主角，喜憨少年蔡佳宏（Leo）也跟著一起跑映後Q&A，每次出場都獲得觀眾滿滿的肯定，覺得他的演出自然又可愛。家有喜憨兒的媽媽特別感謝藍正龍，關心喜憨兒家庭拍攝了這部作品，讓藍正龍也動容，他說：「就如同電影中的台詞，Leo他『真的做到了』。」

Lan Zhenglong directed the film ""I Love You Silly, I Love You"", and the Taipei box office set a new NT$2.07 million. The heroine Guo Shuyao cooperated with the New Taipei City Government to invite the disadvantaged families to advance to the Woods Xiutai Studios to watch the movie. They also worked as the manager of the day with the director Lan Zhenglong, and read the picture book ""Guess how much I love"" to the children.
Guo Shuyao originally had a cute child's voice, and it was easy to read the picture book. Although Lan Zhenglong is always cool, but it is already the father of two children, there is a set of children's books, and the sound of the doll plays on the scene. The rabbit is also equipped with body movements, and all the children are fascinated.
At the time of the screening after the screening of the film, many children on the scene had many questions to ask the director. The problems of the children were full of innocence, and both Guo Shuyao and Lan Zhenglong felt very interesting. A little girl with big eyes asked Yao Yao to say, ""Mermaid, why do you walk now?"" I laughed happily, and Yaoyao responded happily: ""Because I am a mermaid with only legs!"" Some children asked her, ""Why are you so beautiful?"" Let her be happy to say: ""You are also very beautiful!""
There are also very early-aged children who asked the director Lan Zhenglong that the film has a picture of Yao Yao’s role as a supporter, but why is the film a general grade? Lan Zhenglong also seriously explained that the series review is based on the degree of brilliance and awareness, but the film in the film does not have any nakedness, but the little sister who asked the question said that she still feels shy when she sees the picture. There are also children's professional questions: ""Why does the director set Yao Yao's role as a prostitute?"" Let Lan Zhenglong wonder if he is a few years old. He thinks that the children are very familiar with their minds and really understand what the movie says.
The children are also curious, what is the feeling of Lan Zhenglong being licked by the girl in the film, and he smiled and replied: ""It is a fake banknote, so it hurts."" In addition, the real hero of the film, the magpie boy Cai Jiahong ( Leo) also followed Q&A after running, and every time he appeared, he was very satisfied with the audience and felt that his performance was natural and lovely. The mother who has a magpie is especially grateful to Lan Zhenglong. She cares about the work of the family of Magpies and makes Lan Zhenglong move. He said, ""Like the lines in the movie, Leo ""has really done it.""
