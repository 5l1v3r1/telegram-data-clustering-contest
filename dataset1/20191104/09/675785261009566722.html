      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T09:18:07+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 09:18</time> by <a rel="author">Brogan-Leigh Hurst</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lisa-armstrong">Lisa Armstrong</a> is just getting better and better, and she's proved it with her latest snap.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> make-up artist, 43, is plodding on with life and work amid her divorce war with the TV presenter, also 43.</p>
      <p>In a snap on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , Lisa looked incredible as she sported fresh make-up and new hair, which her fans loved.</p>
      <p>She shared a posed-up photo which read: "Work selfie... Happy Sunday everyone!! x"</p>
      <p>"Love your hair. Looks lovely," one gushed.</p>
      <p>While another commented: "Looking stunning".</p>
      <p>And a third penned: "Oh My Goodness Lisa you are just stunning".</p>
      <p>The couple announced their split in January 2018, and took the first step towards divorce nine months later following 11 years of marriage.</p>

      <p>Their relationship had been under pressure following Ant's addiction to painkillers after 'botched' knee surgery, and the fact he was "intolerable to live with", according to his estranged wife.</p>
      <p>The photo comes amid talks to reach a settlement before I'm A Celebrity begins, as Lisa is entitled to some of Ant's £62million fortune.</p>
      <p>Ant is "desperate" to reach a settlement before the hit ITV show starts and has reportedly made a move to set up new mediation talks so they can sort it out away from court.</p>

      <p>But Lisa is refusing to be pressured into a pay-off that she she doesn't think is right and won't sign a non-disclosure agreement, according to  <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10268435/ant-mcpartlin-divorce-talks-settlement-im-a-celebrity/">The Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>The pair have been at loggerheads over a £62million settlement and left arbitration without coming to an agreement last month.</p>
      <p>Ant is said to be worried the case will be sent back to the High Court if their lawyers can't come up with a deal.</p>

      <p>He fears this will lead to a "very public and messy divorce hearing" with Lisa.</p>
      <p>Ant reportedly wants to get the issue sorted before he returns to the jungle on November 17.</p>
      <p>Despite this, he has recently moved into a new £6million Wimbledon home with girlfriend Anne-Marie Corbett.</p>
