      <p>FORT MYERS, Fla. -- A Fort Myers city councilman is saying he has some concerns about the police department's newly-appointed inspector general.</p>
      <p>Councilman Johnny Streets says he is going to bring up a motion on Monday to discuss the new hire.</p>
      <p>Last month, the city <a href="https://www.fox4now.com/news/local-news/inspector-general-now-on-the-job-at-fort-myers-police">hired Donald Oswald for the position</a> . Part of his job will be reviewing Internal Affairs investigations and looking at how officers are disciplined.</p>
      <p>Streets says he supports the hire, but says the position should not report to Police Chief Derrick Diggs. That's how Oswald's job is set up right now.</p>
      <p>Instead, Streets says the position should be independent of police control.</p>
