2007年出生的台灣烏克麗麗演奏家馮羿，今年滿12歲剛唸國中一年級，但其音樂足跡卻已踏遍亞、歐、美3大洲。馮羿在去年推出單曲《8普拉斯》、雙單曲EP《襪子在哪裡》後，再接再厲於今年的10月30日推出個人首張音樂專輯 《Silence in the storm》！

馮羿昨天在台北市的金融研訓院的1樓廣場書店內，舉辦了「烏克麗麗的風暴」演奏暨專輯簽名會。馮羿在台上總共表演《童年抒情 」》、 《Happy ending》等6首曲子。
他在台上介紹曲目時充滿自信，整個人神彩飛揚，爸爸也補充講：「馮羿台上在台下不是同一個人，他台上的演出動作都沒有訓練過。」但馮羿則吐槽自己：「我的表達能力有點爛，生活上常常講話講到邏輯錯亂。」
馮羿上國中後，每天至多練彈樂器1小時，目前還沒有寫到暗戀的歌。他透露最常做的運動是游泳，並解釋說：「因為我只能做不太會用到手指的運動，選擇游泳還能增加肺活量。」他還透露曾在學校被同學在電腦課時突然轉過頭問道：「你是不是上過電視？」
曾經跟天團五月天一起拍過hTC的電視廣告的馮羿被問到，如果未來有機會一起表演的話，最想合作哪一首歌時，他回答：「是在廣告裡的《頑固》這首歌。」而在台灣的流行歌手中馮羿最崇拜伍佰，他說：「因為伍佰老師的電吉他很強 ，流行樂壇很少有像他這種走吉他音樂英雄路線，能唱又能彈的歌手。」

Born in 2007, Taiwanese Uklily player Feng Wei, who has just finished his first year at the age of 12, has traveled to Asia, Europe and the United States on three continents. After the release of the single ""8 Plath"" and the double single ""Where is the Socks"" last year, Feng Wei continued to launch his first music album ""Silence in the Storm"" on October 30 this year!

Feng Wei held the ""Ukuleli's Storm"" performance and album signing meeting in the 1st floor square bookstore of the Financial Research Institute in Taipei yesterday. On the stage, Feng Wei performed a total of six songs including ""Children's Lyrics"" and ""Happy End"".
When he introduced the repertoire on stage, he was full of self-confidence. The whole person was full of brilliance. Dad added: ""Feng Wei is not the same person in the stage. His performances on the stage have not been trained."" But Feng Wei spit himself: ""My ability to express is a bit bad, and I often talk in life about logical confusion.""
After Feng Wei went to the middle school, he practiced playing the instrument for up to one hour every day. At present, he has not written a secret song. He revealed that the most common exercise was swimming, and explained: ""Because I can only do sports that don't use my fingers, swimming can increase lung capacity."" He also revealed that he was suddenly transferred to school during class in a computer class. I asked too early: ""Have you ever been to the TV?""
Feng Wei, who once filmed hTC's TV commercial with Tiantian Mayday, was asked if he would like to cooperate with him if he had the opportunity to perform together in the future. He replied: ""It is the song ""Stubborn"" in the advertisement. Among the pop singers in Taiwan, Feng Wei worships Wu Hao most. He said: ""Because Wu Yi’s electric guitar is very strong, there are very few singers in the pop music scene who can sing and play like him. .""
