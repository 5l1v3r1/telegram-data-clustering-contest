      <p>NEW DELHI: Asserting that "Make in India" has become "Buy from China", Congress leader <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rahul-Gandhi">Rahul Gandhi</a> on Monday hit out at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/RCEP">RCEP</a> and alleged that the proposed free trade deal will flood the country with cheap goods, resulting in millions of job losses and crippling the economy.</p>
      <p>Gandhi's takedown of the proposed trade agreement came as Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in Bangkok where negotiations for the long-overdue <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Regional-Comprehensive-Economic-Partnership">Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership</a> (RCEP) was heading towards finality.</p>
      <p>"'Make in India' has become 'Buy from China'. Each year we import Rs 6,000 worth of goods from China for every Indian! A 100 per cent increase since 2014," the former Congress chief said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>"RCEP will flood India with cheap goods, resulting in millions of job losses &amp; crippling the Indian economy," Gandhi said.</p>

      <p>His remarks come two days after Congress president Sonia Gandhi launched a blistering attack on the government's economic policies and said signing the RCEP agreement will deal a "body blow" to the economy, resulting in "untold hardship" for farmers, shopkeepers and small enterprises.</p>
      <p>The BJP, in a quick response, slammed the Congress leader over his views and presented three "facts" about the RCEP. Replying to the tweet, the BJP wrote: "Dear @RahulGandhi, Seems meditation trip has woken you up to RCEP. Facts that will help your selective amnesia: 1. UPA entered RCEP negotiations in 2012; 2. Trade deficit with China increased by 23 times from $1.9Bn in 2005 to $44.8Bn in 2014; 3. Now PM Modi is cleaning your mess."</p>

      <p>The proposed free-trade agreement includes 10 member-countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and six of the bloc's dialogue partners â€” China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
      <p>The possible delay in firming up the RCEP during the three-day Asean summit in Bangkok has been attributed to India's demands on market access and tariff-related issues.</p>
      <p>Hardball negotiations to address sticky issues went down to the wire on Sunday, with India holding on to its demand for amicable resolution of its demands.</p>
