Hillary Clinton leads Trump in a new Fox News poll. Yes, in November 2019.
04 Nov 2019, 09:40 by Peter Weber
A Fox News poll released Sunday did not have great news for President Trump. His approval rating was 42 percent, with 57 percent of registered voters disapproving of his job performance and 46 percent strongly disapproving. A year before the 2020 election, he is behind all of the top-tier Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden (51 percent to 39 percent), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (46 percent to 41 percent), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (49 percent to 41 percent). Even worse, Trump is losing to Hillary Clinton, who isn't even running, 43 percent to 41 percent.
Since Clinton is not running, it isn't clear why Fox News decided to ask voters to choose between her and Trump. The pollsters noted that the last time they included Clinton in a matchup against Trump was Nov. 3-6, 2016, during which period she was also leading Trump, 46 percent to 42 percent — and also actually running for president. Which, again, she isn't currently.
The poll was conducted Oct. 27-30 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R). They surveyed 1,040 voters nationwide on cellphones and landlines, and the poll's margin of error is ±3 percentage points.
