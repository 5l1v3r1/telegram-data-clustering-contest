港星「阿嬌」鍾欣潼曾捲入2008年陳冠希豔照門風波，不僅作品大減，也重創演藝形象，去年則和「醫界王陽明」賴弘國結婚。近日她於綜藝節目《演員請就位》中重新詮釋知名女星阮玲玉，受訪時阿嬌也鬆口吐低潮時的心聲。
阿嬌日前於中國綜藝節目《演員請就位》中，重新詮釋知名女星阮玲玉一角，《阮玲玉》一片曾由關錦鵬執導，張曼玉飾演，該片也讓張曼玉拿下金馬影后，而阮玲玉這名曾經紅極一時的女星，事業風光但情路坎坷，最後留下寫著「人言可畏」的遺書，吞下安眠藥結束一生，年僅25歲。
對於詮釋阮玲玉這個角色，阿嬌表示，完全感覺到她那個時候不能面對那些輿論壓力。她坦承，在她最困難的時候，人生最低谷的時候，也沒有辦法去面對很多人。
提起「人言可畏」這四個字，阿嬌認為，不要說我這一代不能承受，更何況是1935年的時候，根本就是可以逼死一個人的事情，所以認為阮玲玉其實很強大，又很脆弱。
而阿嬌飾演的阮玲玉也大獲好評，網友大讚「演活了阮玲玉」「每個眼神都恰到好處」。

Hong Kong Star ""Gillian"" Zhong Xinyi was involved in the 2008 Chen Guanxi Yan Zhaomen storm, not only the work was greatly reduced, but also the image of the performing arts. Last year, he married the ""medical world Wang Yangming"" Lai Hongguo. Recently, she reinterpreted the famous actress Yan Lingyu in the variety show ""The Actors are in Place"". At the time of the interview, Gillian also vomited the voice of the low tide.
Gillian recently reinterpreted the famous actress Yan Lingyu in the Chinese variety show ""The Actors are in Place"". ""Zhu Lingyu"" was directed by Guan Jinpeng and played by Maggie Cheung. The film also allowed Maggie Cheung to win the Golden Horse Shadow. The actress who used to be a smash hit, has a good career and a rough road. She finally left a suicide note with the words ""Awesome Words"" and swallowed the sleeping pills for a lifetime, only 25 years old.
For the interpretation of the role of Yan Lingyu, Gillian said that she completely felt that she could not face the pressure of public opinion at that time. She admits that in her most difficult time, when there is the lowest valley in life, there is no way to face many people.
Put forward the words ""awesome words"", Gillian thinks, don't say that my generation can't bear it, not to mention that in 1935, it was simply something that could kill a person, so I think that Yan Lingyu is actually very powerful and very fragile.
And Gillian, who plays the role of Gillian, is also well received. The netizens praised ""playing the life of Yu Lingyu"". ""Every eye is just right.""
