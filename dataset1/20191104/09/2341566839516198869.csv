（中央社蒙特婁3日綜合外電報導）尼加拉公園官方人員指出，一艘於1918年卡在尼加拉河的鐵船，受到惡劣天氣影響，在相隔一世紀後脫離河床，朝尼加拉瀑布（Niagara Falls）邊緣移動。
尼加拉公園（Niagara Parks）遺產高階管理員希爾（Jim Hill）在網路影片表示：「我們認為它從原本的位置移動約50公尺。」希爾也指出這艘鐵船正處「側翻」狀態。
根據當地媒體報導，10月31日的雨勢和強風襲擊這個地區，是造成鐵船移位的原因。
尼加拉公園指出，這艘鐵船在1918年8月6日的疏濬工程中，因脫離拖船而卡在河床上。當時還有2人受困船上，但隔日隨即獲救。
法新社和「華盛頓郵報」（The Washington Post）報導，這艘卡在距離瀑布邊緣600公尺的鐵駁船（Iron Scow），成為尼加拉瀑布的標誌性景物。
這艘鐵船朝瀑布方向移動，尼加拉公園執行長阿達梅斯（David Adames）告訴加拿大廣播公司（CBC）：「目前看來是安全的，但若出現惡劣天氣，它可能還會繼續移位。」
每年皆有數百萬名遊客造訪尼加拉瀑布，它是由橫跨美國和加拿大3座瀑布組成的大瀑布。（譯者：吳昇鴻/核稿：陳昱婷）1081104
