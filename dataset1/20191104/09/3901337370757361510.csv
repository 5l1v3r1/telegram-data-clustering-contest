However, with City themselves deciding to terminate the 41-year-old’s contract, sources have revealed that Ertugral has now emerged as the number one candidate to take over the helm at the club.
The source added that Ertugral arrived in Cape Town on Friday, suggesting that his camp has been in talks with Comitis.
In addition, sources have indicated that former AmaZulu FC head coach, Cavin Johnson has also made it on the list of potential candidates.
