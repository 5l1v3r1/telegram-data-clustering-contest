The attention of English players has risen because of Gomes
04 Nov 2019, 09:39 by Abdurrahman Gambo Ahmad

Everton's Andre Gomes suffered a shoulder injury, prompting Tottenham's Son Heung-min to shed tears, while his other team mates were troubled by the perceived violence.

Son was attacked by Gomes in the past, causing him to fall, where he was immediately responded to by high-level players and some of his close observers.
Some of the players put their hands on you, with a sad mood, noting the seriousness of the injury.
The Portuguese-born Gomes has been rushed to hospital, where he is confirmed to have suffered a broken leg and shoulder strain, while he is expected to have surgery on Monday.
The English Premier League match between the two sides has been postponed for six minutes because of the team's medical malpractice.
Son has already been handed a red card in the 1-1 draw.
