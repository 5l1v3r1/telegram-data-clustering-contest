      <h1>Czech Central Bank Prepares Fine For Calling Physical Bitcoins ‘Coins’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T09:32:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 09:32</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) friendly <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/czech-republic">Czech</a> crypto-anarchist movement Paralelní Polis has received a warning from the country’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/central-bank">central bank</a> for issuing its own coins.</p>
      <h3>Central bank fine “completely nonsensical”</h3>
      <p>As representatives reported on <a href="https://twitter.com/Paralelni_polis/status/1190951677282652165">Twitter</a> on Nov. 3, the Czech National Bank (CNB) has objected to Paralelní Polis using the term “coin” to describe commemorative silver tokens it is currently minting.</p>
      <p>In 2018, a new law appeared giving sole rights to the word “coin” to the CNB. </p>
      <p>“Czech National Bank sent us an official threat that if we continue to use the word ‘Mince’ (‘Coin’) on our site, we will be fined. The bank claims to have a #Monopoly on the word,” the Twitter post reads.</p>
      <p>Speaking to local media outlet <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/kverulant-proti-eet-se-dostal-do-krizku-i-s-centralni-bankou-jadrem-sporu-je-tentokrat-jedno-slovo-81968">Seznam Zprávy</a>, Martin Leskovjan, the group’s chairman, described the situation as “completely nonsensical.”</p>
      <p>“We’re calling the coin a coin,” he summarized. </p>
      <h3>Government falls out of love with crypto</h3>
      <p>Since 2014, Paralelní Polis has become a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/award-winning-czech-artist-collective-ztohoven-opens-hacker-space-paralelni-polis-in-prague-20141017">well-known Bitcoin entity</a> in the Czech capital, Prague, and includes facilities such as a cafe that accepts BTC payments. </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.paralelnipolis.cz/coins/">silver coins</a> are among the collective’s latest projects and include a nominal value of 0.01 BTC ($92) via a partnership with physical currency startup BitNotes.</p>
      <p>Each coin has the image of one of three figures who are significant in both the Bitcoin space and beyond: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ross-ulbricht">Ross Ulbricht</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/julian-assange">Julian Assange</a> and Aaron Swartz.</p>
      <p>“With this project, we wanted to pay homage to people who rebelled against the system and whose work significantly contributed to internet freedom,” a <a href="https://www.paralelnipolis.cz/coins/">blog post</a> about the project explains. </p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/czech-republic-to-impose-stricter-crypto-regulations-than-eu-requires">reported</a>, the Czech Republic has opted for a more conservative approach to cryptocurrency freedoms. In August, authorities chose to implement tougher regulations than those required by the European Union. </p>
      <p>Under the new requirements, cryptocurrency businesses who do not register their activities could face a fine of up to around $20,000. </p>
