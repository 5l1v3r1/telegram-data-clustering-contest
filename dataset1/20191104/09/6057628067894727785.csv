04 Nov 2019, 09:16 by Ahmed Abba

Hurricane Katrina hit southwest France, causing heavy waves and knocking down trees, causing an estimated 140,000 people to lose power.

The storm, called Amelie, which experts say travels 160 kilometers an hour, knocks down a bunch of trees that cut off motorways and railways with electric wires.
Emergency responders, who say they reached hundreds of people in need of a phone call, did not confirm the death was caused by the light, but reports said a 70-year-old woman. , disappeared in South Nice, after the ground had been scorched close to her home.
In the southwestern part of the country, where at least three people were killed, most of them were victims of tree failure.
Officials put at least 14 local counties in the program or other, while Amelie storms came with heavy rainfall.
