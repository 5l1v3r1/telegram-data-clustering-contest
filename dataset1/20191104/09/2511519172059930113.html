      <p>Growing up in West Bengal, my upbringing was very multicultural.</p>
      <p>My mum would cook us paneer, as that was what Punjabi families would eat, but my Chinese friends would cook tofu with lots of soya – steamed, fried or cooked with spices.</p>
      <p>I was not a great fan of tofu while growing but, somehow, now this recipe is so comforting. I go back to it all the time by tweaking with a few ingredients here and there.</p>
      <p>Here, I’ve combined tofu with the flavours of India and China to create a truly multicultural dish.</p>
      <h3>Chilli tofu</h3>
      <p>
        <i>200g tofu, diced into chunks <br/>2 large red onions, sliced <br/>2 green chillies, chopped<br/>15g thinly sliced ginger<br/>4tsp soy sauce <br/>3tsp pomegranate molasses<br/>2tsp tomato puree <br/>1tsp ground cumin<br/>1tsp ground coriander​<br/>1tsp salt <br/>1tsp cornflour <br/>6tsp sunflower oil  Handful fresh coriander for garnish </i>
      </p>
      <p>In a bowl, add all the spices, salt, ginger, chillies, soy sauce, pomegranate molasses, corn flour and tofu. Mix all the ingredients together and keep aside .</p>
      <p>Heat oil in a pan and add the sliced onions once the oil is hot. Cook for 10 minutes on medium heat. Keep stirring, so that the onions don’t get burnt.</p>
      <p>Add tomato puree, mix it well, and cook for another 2 minutes.</p>
      <p>Add the marinated tofu and cook further on low heat for another 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>Sprinkle with chopped fresh coriander and serve as a sharing dish.</p>
