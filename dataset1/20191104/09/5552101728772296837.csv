會有《星海爭霸III》嗎？製作總監不正面回應：要看玩家
04 Nov 2019, 09:08 by 周文凱
在今年的暴雪嘉年華（BlizzCon 2019）上，《暗黑破壞神IV》及《鬥陣特攻2》的正式公開，一掃暴雪近日陰霾。但做為另一款暴雪招牌作品，《星海爭霸》系列在這次盛會並沒有太多的新消息，《星海爭霸II》最後一部資料片「虛空之遺」也已發行超過4年。
未來還會有新作品嗎？有外媒專訪了《星海爭霸II》製作總監Tim Morton及首席設計師Kevin Dong；雖然沒有明確答案，但從言談中，他們並不排除開發《星海爭霸III》的可能。
根據PC Gamer的報導，他們在訪談中開門見山詢問Morton：「你在製作《星海爭霸III》嗎？（ Are you making StarCraft 3 ?）」然而Morton並未正面回覆，他先是表示：「要釐清我們未來最佳走向的方法，就是傾聽玩家們的聲音。」接著他又似有若無的表達了開發的主導權還是在公司：「如果玩家有興趣、想要更多的RTS（即時戰略）遊戲，把這個訊息傳達給暴雪是一件很棒的事。」
記者順著脈絡繼續追問Morton，是否還在等待適當時機公布開發的相關訊息？Morton依舊不願正面回應，但他強調：「《星海爭霸II》的開發團隊非常熱衷即時戰略遊戲，我很肯定的說這也是我最愛的題材、最喜歡的遊戲開發類型。」
坐在一旁的Dong也同意Morton的說法，也談到他們持續關注一些新推出的即時戰略遊戲，包括獨立遊戲《Tooth & Tail》、《They Are Billions》，以及微軟正準備推出的《世紀帝國 4》。「實際上，我認為未來有很大的機會；只是，我們得看後續的發展。」
根據PC Gamer披露的訪談內容，可以看出《星海2》開發團隊其實對於開發新作的意願非常高。但關鍵還是在於玩家對於即時戰略遊戲埋不埋單，畢竟這類遊戲目前並不算熱門主流；而暴雪也會視市場的接受度來決定是否投入資源製作《星海》系列續作。

Will there be ""Xinghai Hegemony III""? The production director does not respond positively: to see the player
04 Nov 2019, 09:08 by Zhou Wenkai
In this year's Blizzcon Carnival (BlizzCon 2019), the official disclosure of ""Diablo IV"" and ""Double Attack 2"" has swept the blizzard. However, as another Blizzard signature work, the ""Xinghai Hegemony"" series did not have much new news at this event. The last piece of the ""Xinghai Hegemony II"" piece of ""Void of the Void"" has been released for more than 4 years.
Will there be new works in the future? Foreign media interviewed Tim Morton, director of production of Xinghai Hegemony II, and Kevin Dong, chief designer. Although there is no clear answer, they did not rule out the possibility of developing Xinghai Hegemon III.
According to PC Gamer's report, they asked Morton in the interview: ""Are you making StarCraft 3?"" However, Morton did not respond positively. He first said: ""To clarify our future The best way to go is to listen to the players."" Then he seems to have expressed the dominance of development or in the company: ""If the player is interested, want more RTS (real-time strategy) games, It’s a great thing to convey this message to Blizzard.""
The reporter continued to ask Morton along the veins. Is it still waiting for the appropriate time to announce the relevant information for development? Morton is still reluctant to respond positively, but he stressed: ""The development team of ""StarCheng II"" is very keen on real-time strategy games. I am sure that this is my favorite theme and my favorite game development type.""
Sitting on the side of Dong also agrees with Morton's statement, and also talks about their continued attention to some of the new real-time strategy games, including the indie games Tooth & Tail, The Are Are Billions, and the Century Empire 4 that Microsoft is preparing to launch. 》. ""Actually, I think there are great opportunities in the future; just, we have to look at the follow-up development.""
According to the interviews disclosed by PC Gamer, it can be seen that the Xinghai 2 development team is actually very willing to develop new works. But the key is that players don't pay for real-time strategy games. After all, such games are not currently hot mainstream; Blizzard will also decide whether to invest resources to produce the ""Xinghai"" series sequel, depending on the market acceptance.
