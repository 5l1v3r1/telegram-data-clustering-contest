      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Everton">Everton</a> are investigating an incident of alleged racist behaviour during their <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/PremierLeague">Premier League</a> draw against <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TottenhamHotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/cenk-tosun">Cenk Tosun</a> snatched an added-time point for the Toffees to cancel out <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/dele-alli">Dele Alli</a>‘s opener.</p>
      <p>After the match, Everton Fan Services posted that they were looking into allegations of racist behaviour.</p>
      <p>“Everton is investigating an alleged incident of racist behaviour by a supporter attending today’s fixture against Tottenham,” read a statement on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“Everton strongly condemns any form of racism. Any such behaviour has no place within our stadium, our Club, our community or our game.”</p>
      <p>The match was overshadowed by a sickening injury to Toffees midfielder <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/andre-gomes">Andre Gomes</a>, who will undergo surgery on a fracture dislocation to his right ankle on Monday after falling awkwardly following a challenge by Tottenham’s Son Heung-min.</p>
      <p>Son was sent off having initially been shown a yellow card.</p>
