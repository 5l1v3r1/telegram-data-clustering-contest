""He knows football, he's a proper football person. Like Sir Alex Ferguson, Jurgen Klopp at Mainz, Pep Guardiola at Barcelona B - he's shown what he can do.
""I believe there are managers in lower league football who are very gifted and deserve an opportunity. Chris has gone through the whole lot.""
A number of Arsenal fans have turned on Emery, who is in the final season of his two-year contract.
When asked if he feels his position is under threat, Emery said: “I am very demanding of myself. I feel every time my responsibility to work and to come back from the result with the next matches.
He added: “We are speaking about how we can improve and take the good way, and also being calm in the dressing room with the players to achieve performances individually and collectively. These are the conversations at this time.”
