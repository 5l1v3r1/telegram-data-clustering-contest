      <h3>Can you tell us a bit about your background?</h3>
      <p>I’m from Belgian and grew up bilingually speaking French/German due to my location (near the german border in Belgium). I’m very passionate about languages which also applies in the tech field with programming languages such as C++, PHP, Typescript, Python and Java which I have professional experience in. I started scripting when I was 9 when I got my first Commodore64, then moved to more robust programming skills with C and C++ basics when I was 12 and my dad offered me my first PC (Pentium 3). Programming was actually my dad’s hobby, I’m very proud that I have made it a professional career path for myself!</p>
      <h4>How did you get involved with NEM?</h4>
      <p>My NEM journey started with a research about distributed ledger technology in 2014. I then started developing the PacNEM project which really evolved to a showcase project for the NEM blockchain platform. The NEM community welcomed me warmly. I have been following and contributing to forum posts, Telegram and Slack discussions and many other communication channels of NEM for years now.</p>
      <h4>Which part of Catapult are you most excited about?</h4>
      <p>I’m most excited about being able to run my own private blockchain network with so much comfort. I have been working alongside the SDK teams to permit easier and better client implementations of the Catapult protocol and I’m looking forward to seeing it act in a public environment.</p>
      <p>I’m also excited about being able to wrap transactions in atomic wrappers, aka. aggregate transactions. In fact, this opens the door for an infinite number of useful transaction schemes.</p>
      <h4>What are you currently working on?</h4>
      <p>I have been working on many feature descriptions and focusing on the Catapult technology with its upcoming Public Network Release. Catapult comes with many never-heard-of features that I am very excited to be able to use daily!</p>
