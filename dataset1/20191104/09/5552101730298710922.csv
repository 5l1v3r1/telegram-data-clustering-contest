路嘉欣〈你不懂〉勾回憶　女歌迷瞬間被逼哭了
04 Nov 2019, 09:03 by 陳于嬙
路嘉欣上週末在中南部舉辦《落落大方 One Two FREE Fall》音樂分享會，以說唱方式與歌迷互動，她說：｢我的歌迷都好害羞，現場雖然坐滿了人卻一片死寂，幾乎都自問自答。」
在高雄、台中兩場音樂分享會上，路嘉欣唱著新歌〈忙〉，腦中竟浮現了光良，她解釋：｢有一句歌詞是『而你呀你，一度是他平淡日子裡光亮』，可能是因為曲的關係，突然發現，咦？怎麼一直在唱『光良』2個字。」既然都想起了光良，路嘉欣順便幫光良宣傳明年小巨蛋演唱會，並幫他賣票，引起歌迷大笑。

在音樂分享會上，路嘉欣除了唱新歌，還唱了上一張專輯的經典歌曲〈你不懂〉，她說：「應該是很多人的青春回憶，同時當然也是我的青春，也是我的起點。」果然，路嘉欣一唱，勾起現場一名女歌迷的回憶，邊聽歌邊落淚，她說：｢這個女生坐第一排，聽到〈你不懂〉時，她就哭了，不知道她想起什麼了呢？希望我有給到她一些回憶和安慰。」

Lu Jiaxin held a music sharing session of ""One Two FREE Fall"" in the south-central last weekend. She interacted with fans in a rap style. She said: ""My fans are so shy. Although the audience is full of people, they are dead and almost ask themselves. .""
At two music sharing sessions in Kaohsiung and Taichung, Lu Jiaxin sang a new song, ""Busy"", and Guangliang appeared in her mind. She explained: ""There is a lyrics that are ""and you, you were once light in his plain days"", maybe It is because of the relationship between the songs, suddenly found out, oh? How have you been singing ""Guangliang"" 2 words."" Since they all remembered Guangliang, Lu Jiaxin helped Guangliang to promote the next year's Little Dome concert and help him sell tickets, causing fans to laugh.

In the music sharing meeting, in addition to singing new songs, Lu Jiaxin also sang the classic song of the previous album, ""You don't understand."" She said: ""It should be the youthful memories of many people, and of course my youth, and also my starting point. Sure enough, Lu Jiaxin sang, recalled the memories of a female fan at the scene, and listened to the song and shed tears. She said, ""This girl is sitting in the first row. When she hears ""You don't understand,"" she cries, no. Do you know what she thinks about? I hope I have given her some memories and comfort.""
