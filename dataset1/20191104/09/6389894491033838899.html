      <p>Woodford Patient Capital Trust said today that its fund administrator had cut the value of its holding in cold fusion company Industrial Heat.</p>
      <p>Link Fund Solutions downgraded Woodford’s stake in IH Holdings which the trust said was to reflect a “delay in operational progress”.</p>
      <p>As a result, the company’s net asset value has been cut by approximately 5p per share.</p>

      <p>Link is also revaluing another business upwards by approximately 0.7p per share after it secured funding.</p>
      <p>The net effect is a reduction in net asset value of approximately 4.3p per share.</p>
      <p>The trust’s share price fell 6.3 per cent today to 35.5p.</p>

      <p>Fund manager Neil Woodford faced <a href="https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/11/25/2180322/so-neil-woodford-invested-in-a-cold-fusion-company/">widespread scepticism</a> regarding his investment into Industrial Heat, which has also been supported by film star Brad Pitt.</p>
      <p>The company’s activities include researching cold fusion, which is a nuclear reaction at or near room temperature.</p>
      <p>Woodford was ousted as manager of his flagship Woodford Equity Income Fund last month and also resigned as manager of the Woodford Patient Capital Trust.</p>
