      <p>At its annual <a href="https://max.adobe.com/">MAX conference</a> today, Adobe announced a range of new features for its Creative Cloud suite of software for Macs and PCs, including Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, InDesign, and more.</p>

      <p><i>Adobe Lightroom</i> <br/>Adobe is releasing a major update to Photoshop on the desktop today with several improvements based on its Sensei artificial intelligence technology, including new capabilities in the Object Selection Tool and Content-Aware-Fill. <br/><br/>Adobe has added three ways to identify where in your image you want Content-Aware Fill to look for source pixels as fill content:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Auto: Intelligently select source pixels by analyzing pixels near the selection</li>
        <li>Rectangular: Chooses pixels nearby</li>
        <li>Custom: Full control to identify exactly which pixels to fill from</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The latest version of Photoshop is faster for many tasks, including opening files on a Mac. Adobe has added new quick action buttons to accelerate common tasks, such as the ability to one-click to remove a background, select a subject while in the pixel layer properties panel, or quickly convert text layers into a frame or shape. <br/><br/>Preset workflows have been overhauled, with new, dedicated panels and behaviors for gradients, patterns, and shapes. Presets can be organized into groups, and you can drag and move to rearrange and re-order them.</p>

      <p>To learn more about the new features and improvements in Photoshop, read <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/creativity-is-everywhere-now-photoshop-is-too-begin-the-journey-of-photoshop-reimagined-for-the-ipad/">Adobe's blog post</a> and its <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/whats-new.html">what's new in Photoshop page</a>. <br/><br/>Following months of beta testing, Adobe today is also making Photoshop on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> available to all Creative Cloud customers who have a subscription to Photoshop. Photoshop on the ‌iPad‌ is based on the same code base as the desktop version, but it is reimagined for a mobile, touchscreen-based user experience. <br/><br/>With the ‌iPad‌ version, you can open and edit PSDs, view and edit your layered documents, and take advantage of core functionality such as compositing, masking, and retouching. Adobe plans to add several new features to the app over time. Read <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/04/adobe-launches-photoshop-for-ipad/">our Photoshop for iPad post</a> for more details. <br/><br/>Adobe today also announced that it has integrated cloud document capabilities into Photoshop and expanded support to PSDs. This allows you to access and work on projects across devices, including Photoshop for Mac and ‌iPad‌, with all edits seamlessly saved to the cloud with an auto-save feature.</p>
