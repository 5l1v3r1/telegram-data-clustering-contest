04 Nov 2019, 09:27 by 吳妍, 陳毅偉
中國國台辦、國家發展改革委等單位今公布《關於進一步促進兩岸經濟文化交流合作的若干措施》（簡稱26條措施），其中包括台灣人可在中國駐外使館尋求協助並辦理旅行證件。對此外交部指出，中華民國台灣國民是主權國家，政府對我國國民行使領事權與中國無涉。外交部長吳釗燮也在推特上發文用簡體字表示「我们台湾用不到「一国两制」，真的不用客气。」。
外交部表示，對於北京政府所提的措施指是在推銷「一國兩制臺灣方案」，意在最終併吞台灣，強調政府已多次說明「拒絕一國兩制就是台灣共識」，中國政府假意惠台，不會得逞。
外交部長吳釗燮也在推特上用簡體字強調「中国国台办推出对台26条，去年也有31条，看起来好多条。 但我们台湾用不到「一国两制」，真的不用客气。 给你们人民多点自由也不错ㄛ！ JW」



網友也紛紛留言表示「他們沒有學注音符號 ㄛ會看不懂」、「部長好貼心還幫他們轉換成簡體字ㄛ」

Rejecting China's ""26 Measures"" Wu Hao: Taiwan does not use ""one country, two systems"" without politeness
04 Nov 2019, 09:27 by Wu Hao, Chen Yiwei
The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, the National Development and Reform Commission and other units have announced the ""Several Measures to Further Promote Cross-Strait Economic and Cultural Exchanges and Cooperation"" (referred to as 26 measures), including Taiwanese who can seek assistance and travel documents at Chinese embassies abroad. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that the Taiwanese nationals of the Republic of China are sovereign states, and the government’s exercise of consular power over our nationals has nothing to do with China. Foreign Minister Wu Hao also sent a text in tweets to indicate that ""our Taiwan does not use ""one country, two systems"", and it is really not polite. "".""
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the measures proposed by the Beijing government refer to the promotion of the ""one country, two systems Taiwan program"", which is intended to eventually swallow Taiwan, stressing that the government has repeatedly stated that ""rejecting one country, two systems is the Taiwan consensus"", the Chinese government will not benefit from the fact that it will benefit Taiwan. .
Foreign Minister Wu Hao also emphasized in simplified Chinese characters ""Traditional Taiwan Affairs Office has launched 26 Taiwanese counterparts. Last year, there were also 31 articles. It looks like many. But we do not have ""one country, two systems"" in Taiwan, and we really do not have to be polite. It’s not bad to give your people more freedom! JW""



Netizens also commented that ""they didn't learn the phonetic symbols, they wouldn't understand them."" ""The ministers are also very intimate and help them convert into simplified characters.""
