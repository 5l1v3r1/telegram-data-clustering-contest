Hull Live reports that Pandora has just added a Disney Frozen collection to its collection in stores and online, just in time for the release of the new movie.
The inspiration behind the Frozen 2 collection comes from the colourful personalities of the characters and each of the charms highlights their unique qualities.
Olaf's goofy demeanour is reflected in the moving head of the charm, whereas the Elsa and Nokk double dangle charm features the engraving ""Inner strength"".
There's also a great saving on Elsa's Blue Dress Dangle Charm , which has been reduced from £55 to £25 - view it here on Pandora .

The new Frozen charms cost up to £60 each and will no doubt be hugely popular as Christmas gifts after youngsters and older Disney fans see the sequel which is in cinemas from November 22.
The four new charms include:


Olaf dangle charm, £55
