      <p><i>"I had a long brake pedal and I asked them to look at it, but they couldn't see anything,"</i> he said to the media in Austin after the race. <i>“The temperatures were alright. So I just continued and then the disc exploded.”</i></p>

        <i>“It's a disappointing result, but it didn't come completely unexpected. We know where we are at the moment and that is not where we want to be. As soon as the race starts, we go backwards."  </i>
      </p>
      <p>Magnussen will hope that the teams 2020 season is more successful and that they can sort out their issues before the start of next season. </p>
