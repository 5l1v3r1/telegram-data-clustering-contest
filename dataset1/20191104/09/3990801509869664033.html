      <h1>Moonday Mornings: Bitcoin isn’t money, says UK tax authority</h1>
      <h2>And more in this week's weekend wrap-up</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T09:26:57+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 09:26</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Beedham</a></address>
      <p>Welcome to the first Moonday Morning of November. If you don’t know what that means, where have you been? But seriously, it’s Hard Fork’s wrap-up of this weekend’s cryptocurrency and blockchain news that you can’t afford to miss.</p>
      <p>Let’s take a look.</p>
      <p>1. Late last week, the UK‘s tax office, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tax-on-cryptoassets/cryptoassets-tax-for-businesses#trading-in-exchange-tokens">issued an update</a> to its  guidelines for how <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tax-on-cryptoassets/cryptoassets-tax-for-businesses#trading-in-exchange-tokens">businesses</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tax-on-cryptoassets/cryptoassets-for-individuals">individuals</a> should pay tax on their cryptocurrency. Bear in mind these guidelines relate only to what HMRC refers to as “exchange tokens,” which include Bitcoin. <a href="https://partners.etoro.com/B9157_A72407_TClick.aspx">BTC</a> Guidance on security and utility tokens is coming at a later date. The TL;DR? If you deal in cryptocurrency in the UK you probably owe tax on it, and HMRC doesn’t class the digital tokens as money or currency.</p>
      <p>2. Authorities in Hindustan, India arrested three individuals in connection with an online and cryptocurrency fraud scam, The <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/three-arrested-for-online-cryptocurrency-frauds/story-WcoDMu8w8VDjBEeHYTD26O.html">Hindustan Times</a> reports. The trio offered  ​to help individuals searching for jobs abroad for a fee, once the victim had paid they would cease communication. The group then converted payments to Bitcoin to share amongst themselves. It’s not known how much the group earned as a result.</p>
      <p>3. According to <a href="https://www.scmp.com/print/business/companies/article/3036101/bubble-or-smart-early-bet-blockchain-stock-frenzy-china">South China Morning Post</a>, blockchain related stocks went on a “roller-coaster” ride last week, allegedly fueled by the Chinese president’s <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/10/28/moonday-morning-china-goes-crazy-over-blockchain/">endorsements of the technology</a>. However, analysts say that a “profitable application of blockchain is years away.” You’d have thought investors would have learned by now. Take the case of beverage company <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/08/02/sec-cryptocurrency-blockchain-subpoena/">Long Island Tea Corp. which changed its name</a> to “Long Blockchain Corp.” Its stock price shot up despite there being no real blockchain-based technology. Maybe we’ll never learn.</p>
      <p>4. Reginald Middleton, the self-professed financial guru that was being sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly running a fraudulent initial coin offering, has agreed to settle the case for $9.5 million. In a <a href="https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/middleton.pdf">court document</a> published last Friday, Middleton agreed to the judgement, however did not admit or deny the allegations and has waived his right to appeal, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/reggie-middleton-reaches-9-5-million-sec-settlement-over-ico-fraud">CoinDesk</a> reports. According to the SEC, Middleton raised funds in his ICO by “making material misrepresentations” about the tokens being sold.</p>
      <p>And finally…</p>
      <p>5. Craig Wright, the Australian businessman who has continually claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto but failed to provide cogent proof, has now <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.521536/gov.uscourts.flsd.521536.290.0.pdf">revealed he can’t pay</a> the 500,000 Bitcoin ($4.5 billion) settlement in the case against David Kleiman’s estate. Wright has been fighting allegations in court that he stole Bitcoin from supposed Bitcoin co-creator, the late David Kleiman. He had originally agreed to pay the settlement, however, with Wright’s latest omission the trial is back on with another hearing due to take place in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/trial-back-on-after-craig-wright-breaks-bitcoin-settlement-agreement">March, 2020</a>.</p>
      <p>Well, that’s all for this week. Now go get to work.</p>
