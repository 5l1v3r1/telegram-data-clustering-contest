      <p>An insanely intense food challenge is here to test our biggest appetites. Diners are dared to devour possibly the largest burger in Thai history to win a not-bad-sized cash prize.</p>
      <p>A burger joint tucked away in the capital’s Bangkok Noi district, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chrisburgerthailand/">Chris Steaks and Burgers</a>, has created what they’re calling the country’s biggest burger dubbed the “10,000 Cal Burger” and offering THB10,000 (US$330) — 1 baht for each calorie — to whoever – limited to no more than three mouths – that can finish the mega meal within nine minutes.</p>

      <p>As its name suggests, the mammoth sandwich is 10,000 calories and weighs up to 6 kilograms. It features 4 kilograms of meat, 1 kilogram of bacon, 22 cheese sheets, fried onion rings and three types of French fries (original, BBQ and cheese).</p>
      <p>Burgers with beef patties are priced at THB2,500 while the pork versions sell for THB3,500.</p>

      <p>“Making a burger that’s THIS big and tasty, it’s not easy,” restaurant owner Komdech “Chris” Kongsuwun said, adding that he has invested a lot of money to come up with the formula to make the gigantic burger while the ingredients are well-balanced for flavor.</p>
      <p>Wanting to boost the sales of his burgers, Chris partnered with bodybuilder-food YouTuber Anuthep “Yong” Chawengchutichot of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47Ie75vE_s20ygeNgf3gjg/featured">10,000 Cal Muscle</a> for the project.</p>
      <p>Yong brought in a group of three who finished the burger within 9 minutes and 20 seconds, which set the record.</p>

      <p>The eating challenge has attracted competitive eaters and food bloggers, but no one has finished the burger in under nine minutes.</p>
      <p>“I kinda believe that finally there will be a team who can break the record,” Chris said, wistfully.</p>
      <p>New Year’s Eve will be the last day of the challenge.</p>
