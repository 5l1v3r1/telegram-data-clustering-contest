      <p>MAN whose body was pulled from a river in Co Derry last week has been linked to the sectarian murder of the three young Quinn brothers in 1998.</p>
      <p>The remains of Raymond Parke, from Bushmills in Co Antrim, were discovered in the River Bann in Coleraine on Thursday.</p>
      <p>His family had appealed for information just hours before his body was found.</p>
      <p>The Sunday World reported that Parke was named in court as one of two men who had thrown a petrol bomb into the home of Chrissie Quinn and her four children in Ballymoney on July 12 1998.</p>
      <p>The three youngest children, Jason (eight), Mark (nine) and Richard (10), were trapped in their bedroom and died.</p>
      <p>Ms Quinn’s eldest son Lee (12) had been staying overnight at his grandmother’s house.</p>
      <p>It emerged that Ms Quinn had tried to save her children before jumping from an upstairs bedroom window along with her Protestant boyfriend.</p>
      <p>A neighbour said at the time that the children could be heard crying for help with one of them shouting that his feet were burning.</p>
      <p>The family had only been living at the address for six days when it was attacked at the height of the Orange Order standoff at Drumcree outside Portadown.</p>
      <p>In an interview with The Irish News last year Frankie Quinn, a brother of Chrissie Quinn, <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2018/07/09/news/uncle-recalls-the-night-quinn-children-were-killed-in-uvf-petrol-bomb-attack-1376952/">described how he identified the bodies of his nephews</a> and remains traumatised by what he saw.</p>
      <p>Parke never faced charges, however Garfield Gilmour was convicted of the murders but had the charges reduced to manslaughter on appeal.</p>
      <p>He was jailed for 14 years in 2000.</p>
      <p>The savagery of the triple killing made headlines around the world.</p>
      <p>In April 1999, the Quinn brother’s former home was demolished to make way for a children’s play area as a memorial.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, John Dallat, SDLP MLA for East Derry, called for the murder of the Quinn brothers to be reopened.</p>
      <p>“That is the one case from the Troubles that is etched in my memory,” he said. “ I was there when the wee coffins were brought back to Rasharkin and the mother struggling to come to terms with what happened.</p>
      <p>“The outcome of the court case was never satisfactory. Only the driver was ever convicted. If ever a case deserves to be reopened this is it and I will support the family in any way I can.</p>
      <p>“The people responsible need to be brought to justice.”</p>
