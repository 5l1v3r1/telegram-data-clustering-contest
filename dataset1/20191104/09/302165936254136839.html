      <p>PETALING JAYA, Nov 4 — K-pop star Jeon Jung-kook was not drunk driving when he caused an accident on November 2, according to online news portal <i>Naver</i>, quoring a source from the National Police Agency in South Korea.</p>
      <p>Jeon, the youngest member of popular boyband BTS, was driving his Mercedes Benz in the Hannam neighbourhood in Seoul when he violated a traffic regulation and ran into a taxi.</p>
      <p>The source noted that the case is currently an internal investigation as the taxi-driver’s medical diagnosis has not been settled yet.</p>
      <p>“After the medical diagnosis is received or personal harm is confirmed, Jungkook will be booked and investigated.</p>
      <p>“Currently, there are no plans to summon Jungkook.</p>
      <p>“Also, Jungkook was found to not have driven under the influence of alcohol after taking a sobriety test,” said the source.</p>
      <p>Following the accident, both Jeon and the taxi driver were taken to the hospital to be treated for bruises.</p>
      <p>BTS’ label Big Hit Entertainment issued a statement shortly after admitting that Jeon was in the wrong over the accident and said that an “amicable settlement” had been reached between both parties.</p>
      <p>“Currently, we cannot give you any details because the police have not completed their proceedings on the matter.</p>
      <p>“Immediately after the accident, Jungkook admitted that he violated the Road Traffic Act and carried out on-site handling and gave police station statements in accordance with due process.</p>
      <p>“We apologise to the victim and to the fans who have been concerned about this,” read the statement.</p>
      <p>The accident occurred just days after BTS wrapped up a sold-out world tour in their home country of South Korea.</p>
