入圍金馬11項大獎，導演鍾孟宏新作《陽光普照》上週五上映，該片早在正式上映前就已獲得許多名人力薦，甚至把「國師」唐綺陽逼哭到妝都花掉無法接受訪問。全台首週末開出350萬的票房佳績，台北位居新片第二，僅次於好萊塢動畫電影《阿達一族》，也在目前首輪國片中排名第一。其超強口碑，票房後勢看漲。
為回饋廣大影迷支持，上週末導演鍾孟宏攜「陽光三帥」巫建和、劉冠廷、許光漢分別出席光點華山、長春國賓、欣欣秀泰、真善美與in89豪華等戲院映後座談，與粉絲面對面暢談電影。

被問及如何挑選演員，導演鍾孟宏笑言，全靠直覺跟閒談時的感覺，他也爆料：「一開始覺得陳以文老是要導演親自試戲很「裝」、柯淑勤大姐大氣勢很強、許光漢太帥又有點沒自信，但開拍後，所有演員都完美進入角色的狀態，讓我非常感動。」

片中巫建和、劉冠廷好友反目，精湛演技雙雙入圍本屆金馬最佳男主角與最佳男配角，導演鍾孟宏透露兩人只要碰在一起幾乎都是雨天，代表他們在一起，人生就會風風雨雨。劉冠廷表示有一場戲他必須在下暴雨的情況下在荒地上被拖行，敬業的他怕穿幫婉拒劇組為他準備的防護措施，他笑說：「當下我必須演出半昏迷的狀態，當時有些草或碎石很刺，我只能偷偷靠局部肌肉的力量去避開，結果意外練到不常練到的地方。」

但最讓他苦不堪言的是，那場大雨幾乎是灌進他的七孔裡，連眼睛都很難睜開，隱隱約約聽到導演鍾孟宏的喊叫聲，他說：「其實我根本聽不見，拍完後巫建和跑來跟我說鍾導其實在大喊：『冠廷！撐下去！』」此外，巫建和更為戲犧牲，在滂沱大雨中脫到只剩一件內褲，大秀可口的精壯腹肌，但淋了好幾個take後冷到發抖差點感冒。
在鍾孟宏導演進行座談時，先結束活動行程的劉冠廷、許光漢卻突襲探班，他們的驚喜現身也引來現場影迷一陣尖叫。結束後，現場粉絲大排長龍與鍾孟宏導演簽名，將光點華山戲院擠得水洩不通。
《陽光普照》由本地風光、華文創、捌捌玖電影、鏡文學、聯聯看娛樂聯合出品，本地風光製作，金獎導演鍾孟宏執導，資深電影監製葉如芬、曾少千攜手監製。集結陳以文、柯淑勤、巫建和、劉冠廷、許光漢等實力派演員主演，已於11月1日全台上映。該片並入選第44屆多倫多國際影展、第24屆釜山國際電影節及第32屆東京影展。
