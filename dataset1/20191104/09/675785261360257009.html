      <h1>Arsenal stars have 'serious reservations' over Unai Emery's methods</h1>
      <h2>Unai Emery is under pressure at Arsenal despite recently reassurance for the board his job is safe</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T09:24:26+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 09:24</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Members of the Arsenal team have 'serious reservations' over Unai Emery's ability to turn the club into title contenders, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Emery is under increasing pressure in north London and has guided his Gunners side to just two victories in their last nine Premier League fixtures.</p>
      <p>Managers including Jose Mourinho have been linked with his job, despite <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> top brass recently reassuring Emery his position is not currently under threat.</p>
      <p>And there is the sense that should Emery fail to turn things around soon - and frustration among fans continues to grow - the board may be forced to take evasive action.</p>

      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7645491/Unai-Emery-fighting-save-job-Arsenal.html">Daily Mail,</a> another thing going against Emery is the fact that certain players have 'serious reservations' over his methods.</p>
      <p>Some players allegedly fear that the Spaniard has a tendency to be too conservative in his approach, and this is hindering Arsenal's chances of picking up maximum points from games.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have thrown away leads this season, notably against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/watford-fc">Watford</a> .</p>

      <p>Last time out Arsenal took the lead against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and were ahead for most of the match at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>But the home side were once again unable to keep their noses in front and conceded ten minutes before the end, resulting in them dropping two points.</p>
