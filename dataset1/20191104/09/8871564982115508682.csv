Australian national made peace with victims after alleged drunken attack: Police
04 Nov 2019, 09:32 by Coconuts Bali
Bali Police have confirmed that Scott James Harrison, an Australian national who was detained last week after he allegedly attacked security guards at a Kuta hotel while he was drunk, has made peace with his victims and therefore released from custody.
“It means that the case is put to a stop, as both parties have chosen an alternative dispute resolution,” I Putu Ika Prabawa from the Kuta Police told Kumparan today.
The 40-year-old was detained last week after he allegedly went on a rampage and lashed out at the security guards of the hotel he was staying at in Kuta, who were trying to calm him down. 
According to local media reports, Harrison threw punches at three security guards, who suffered bruises and went on to file a police report soon after the incident.
Harrison might have dodged a bullet there, as he could’ve faced a maximum sentence of two years and eight months in prison for the alleged assault under Indonesia’s criminal code.
Last week, a prosecutor in Denpasar demanded Nicholas Carr, an Australian man who was arrested in August for allegedly fly-kicking a man off a moving scooter while he was drunk, be sentenced to four months in prison.
