      <h2>Creators can get crisp, accurate colors across a variety of color standards.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T09:00:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/rachel-england" target="_blank">Rachel England</a></address>
      <p>Dell's newest monitor has been designed with creators in mind. The UP2720Q is the world's first 27-inch 4K monitor with a built-in colorimeter -- a light-sensitive device that measures the intensity and concentration of color. It offers 100 percent Adobe RBG, 98 percent DCI-P3 and 80 percent BT2020, allowing designers to maximize a larger color gamut and more accurately work with images on devices such as smartphones, computers and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/24/the-best-4k-televisions-2019/">TVs</a>, where the DCI-P3 standard is increasingly being used.</p>
      <p>The monitor also comes with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/04/usb4-thunderbolt-3-40gbps/">Thunderbolt 3</a> with speed up to 40Gbps, which can charge up to 90W to a connected notebook while simultaneously transferring video and data signals. It also has a handy Picture-by-Picture feature that allows users to compare visual content side by side in contrasting color spaces or from different sources. It'll be available from January 15th, priced at $2,000.</p>
