独立顾问：威立接获的收购献议公平且合理
04 Nov 2019, 09:43 by Wong Ee Lin
（吉隆坡4日讯）独立顾问建议，威立（Kumpulan Powernet Bhd）小股东接受Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd集团董事经理兼总执行长Datuk Dr Mohd Abdul Karim Abdullah提出收购公司未持有股份的献议。
根据今日向威立股东发出的独立顾问通告，Mercury证券建议股东接受，因献议公平且合理。
该证券行说，每股1令吉的献购价是公平的，因为较40仙的合理价，溢价150%。
此外，献议亦合理，为股东提供一个在短期内实现对威立投资的机会。
除了2017年7月3日至同年7月13日，以及10月22日至最新可行日（LPD），股票在过去3年从来没有高于献购价。
献购价较威立在最后交易日（LTD）的股价高出8.7%，且比截至LTD的5天至1年的成交量加权平均价（VWAP）溢价9.9至28.2%。惟较LPD和截至LPD的5天VWAP，折价13.8和9.1%。
尽管如此，从10月22日至LPD，威立的股价一直高于献购价。然而，与截至LPD的4739万献购股相比，在此期间只交易了1080万股。
“因此，不能保证所有持有人能够在公开市场以高于献购价的价格脱售股份。而且，也无法保证股价在截止期限之后继续以当前的价格交易。”
献购方有意维持威立在马交所主板的上市地位。
闭市时，该股上涨16仙或12.9%，收于1.40令吉，市值报1亿661万令吉。

Independent Consultant: The acquisition offer received by Wei Li is fair and reasonable
04 Nov 2019, 09:43 by Wong Ee Lin
KUALA LUMPUR (April 4): The independent consultant advised Kumbulan Powernet Bhd's minority shareholder to accept the offer of the company's unheld shares by Datuk Dr Mohd Abdul Karim Abdullah, managing director and chief executive of Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd Group.
According to the Independent Consultant Notice issued to the Wiley Shareholders today, Mercury Securities advises shareholders to accept that the offer is fair and reasonable.
The securities firm said that the offer price of RM1 per share was fair because it was a 150% premium to a reasonable price of 40 sen.
In addition, the offer is also reasonable, providing shareholders with an opportunity to realize their investment in Wiley in the short term.
Except for the period from July 3, 2017 to July 13, 2017, and October 22 to the Latest Practicable Date (LPD), the stock has never been higher than the offer price in the past three years.
The offer price is 8.7% higher than Wei Li's share price on the last trading day (LTD) and 9.9 to 28.2% higher than the 5-year to 1-year volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the LTD. However, compared to LPD and the 5-day VWAP as of LPD, the discount was 13.8 and 9.1%.
Despite this, from October 22 to LPD, Wiley’s share price has been higher than the offer price. However, compared to the 47.39 million shares offered by LPD, only 10.8 million shares were traded during this period.
“Therefore, there is no guarantee that all holders will be able to sell shares in the open market at a price higher than the offer price. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the stock will continue to trade at the current price after the deadline.”
The purchaser intends to maintain the listing status of Wei Li on the main board of the Malaysia Stock Exchange.
At the close of the market, the stock rose 16 sen or 12.9% to close at RM1.40 and the market value was RM16.61 million.
