      <h1>US Begins Formal Withdrawal From Paris Climate Accord</h1>

      <p>The Trump administration is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/04/politics/trump-formal-withdrawal-paris-climate-agreement/index.html">formally withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate accord</a>, "the first step in a <a href="https://politics.slashdot.org/story/17/06/11/0615225/the-us-cant-leave-the-paris-climate-deal-until-2020">year-long process</a> to leave the landmark agreement to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases," reports CNN. President Trump <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/17/06/01/194219/trump-announces-us-withdrawal-from-paris-climate-accord">first announced</a> the intent to officially withdraw from the agreement in June 2017. From the report: <i>"Today the United States began the process to withdraw from the Paris Agreement," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. "Per the terms of the Agreement, the United States submitted formal notification of its withdrawal to the United Nations. The withdrawal will take effect one year from delivery of the notification." <br/><br/>Under the framework of the agreement, Monday is the earliest date that the administration can notify the United Nations that the U.S. plans to leave. But the process cannot be completed until exactly one year later on November 4, 2020, which happens to be one day after the 2020 presidential election. Should Trump lose the 2020 election, a new president could rejoin the agreement, but would have to put forth new climate commitments to the UN.</i></p>
