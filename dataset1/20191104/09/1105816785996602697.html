        <b>How it all began</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week,  ‘compromising videos’ of Pirzada went viral on social media. While a huge number of users called her out for ‘profanity’ others came out in her support and slammed the breach of privacy.</p>
      <p>#RabiPirzada was the top trend in the country on Friday, with Twitter users hitting out at the breach.</p>
      <p>Aurat Haq, a Karachi-based activist group also released a statement condemning the violation of privacy, as well as the abuse of trust in an intimate relationship.</p>
      <p>“We condemn the weaponising of a woman’s body against her for revenge porn. While we’re on the subject – let’s deconstruct why we shame women for their expression of sexuality,” the statement went on to say.</p>
      <p>Rights activist Nighat Dad also weighed in, saying that those who are weaponising non-consensual intimate images and videos and forwarding them are committing a crime under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016.</p>
      <p>“Don’t be a silent bystander, report these tweets and do not forward this violence,” she said.</p>
