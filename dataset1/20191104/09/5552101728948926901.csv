「黃色鬼屋」升級「黃金美屋」　燦坤新總座盼點亮新招牌
04 Nov 2019, 09:03 by 曹以斌, 陳俊銘
曾被網友戲稱為「黃色鬼屋」的3C通路龍頭，這幾年營運下滑，今年4月找來前小米台灣總經理李佳峰空降，已到任半年有餘的他首度面對媒體暢談燦坤轉型之路。
「我希望燦坤能從網友口中的『黃色鬼屋』變成『黃金美屋』。」從大陸品牌小米跳槽，空降3C通路龍頭燦坤已滿半年的燦坤總經理李佳峰在媒體聚會上說。
受到電商崛起衝擊，產品價格越來越透明化，讓實體通路紛紛受害，曾以黃色旋風席捲全台的燦坤，這幾年來營運每況愈下，連續8年營收都呈現負成長，今年還一度遭全國電子超車，痛失3C通路龍頭寶座。
今年4月甫空降到燦坤的李佳峰身負轉型重任，經過半年時間，在燦坤推動起轉型革命，希望以消費者為核心，讓燦坤重新「充電」（Charging）與「轉變」（Changing），重新定義屬於燦坤品牌的新3C，以拓展新店格門市、營收結構轉變、推廣獨賣商品、電商優化等策略讓燦坤恢復往日榮光。


曾以黃色旋風席捲全台的燦坤，這幾年來營運每況愈下，連續8年營收都呈現負成長。

在李佳峰的規畫下，燦坤重新定義燦坤品牌從新3C將升級為燦坤電生活（TK3C.com），強調要作到員工對顧客周到、服務對顧客便利，空間對顧客自主的三大核心理念。為了更貼近消費者，李佳峰在接任燦坤總經理之後，也低調的像國外買入TK3C.com網址，還把10年未改的制服與門市風格全面換裝。「燦坤原本門市及員工制服都以黃色為主，這次改版後新門市以黑、灰及黃色為主基調，」
「目前燦坤全省還有283家門市，從第1家門市至今已經有29年，接下來將推出品牌升級的新店型，預估明年首季將開出第1家，未來至少會插旗六都，至於既有門市目前傾向調整體質，沒有大幅關店計畫。」對於各界擔心燦坤轉型是否會大舉關店，李佳峰特別強調讓員工們放心。
為了增加燦坤與電商間的差異與競爭力，李佳峰也特別強化新商品的導入，尤其是獨家、獨賣與首賣商品，像是Sony同意將43吋4K電視、JVC50吋電視、聯想採用Intel第10代CPU的筆記型電腦及綠色大同電鍋等產品都交由燦坤獨賣，另外像Dyson三合一冷暖空氣清淨機就交由燦坤首賣。繼日前獨賣大陸石頭掃地機器人之後，11月初也會導入3個獨家品牌，只會在燦坤獨家販售。「燦坤今年會導入超過250項產品是獨賣及首賣，未來1年將爭取到5百個品項首賣或首發，全面帶動人流與業績。」李佳峰說。
對於各界關心的電商布局，李佳峰透露，燦坤盤點了自身發展電商的優勢，包括付費400萬會員資料庫，透過線上訂購、門市取貨或宅配到府等服務，全面打造「融合性」場景；像是今年7月舉辦的全民購物節來看，業績比去年增加了30%，其中，冰箱、電視、洗衣機、空調等白色、黑色大型家電銷售最為亮眼；李佳峰也發現，過去燦坤電商與App頁面不好瀏覽、點擊率不佳，近期也逐步展開全面優化，將透過雙11檔期的全民購物節來驗收成果。
