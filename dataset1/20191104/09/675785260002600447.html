      <h1>Arguing Liverpool players "drained Aston Villa mentally" says John McGinn</h1>
      <h2>The Reds came from behind to beat Villa 2-1 at Villa Park on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T09:30:18+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool's "relentless" players were arguing with each other during their win over Aston Villa on Saturday, but Villa star John McGinn says they slowly wore their opposition down.</p>
      <p>The Reds trailed 1-0 at Villa Park as the match entered the 87th minute, with a first half strike from Egyptian midfielder Trezeguet the difference.</p>
      <p>However, a header from McGinn's Scotland international teammate Andy Robertson levelled the scores, before Sadio Mane's glancing header from a Trent Alexander-Arnold corner <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/aston-villa-1-2-liverpool-20796192">found the net in the 94th minute to spark delirious scenes in the away end</a> .</p>
      <p>McGinn says it could have all been different though.</p>

      <p>“A lot of their players were arguing and you could tell they were uncomfortable in the first half," said the midfielder after the game, via the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-players-were-arguing-each-17192991">Liverpool Echo</a> .</p>
      <p>"When teams start arguing with each other you normally know you’ve got them but at the same time you have to respect they are such a good team, they just regroup, get together and go again.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately for us they did that."</p>

      <p>McGinn added that it is Liverpool's "relentless" nature that sets them and title rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> apart.</p>
      <p>"You’re playing against the champions of Europe and they could be the champions of England this year," he continued.</p>
      <p>"They don’t give up, they keep going and they probably tired us out too much right at the end.</p>
      <p>“Chances were coming and we were just trying to keep them at bay but the ball just keeps coming back at you.</p>

      <p>“It was two sloppy goals from our point of view but teams like <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> do that to you.</p>
      <p>“They are relentless. It was the same with Man City last week, they just drain you mentally.</p>
      <p>"You try your best to press them but they are top teams and full credit to them."</p>
