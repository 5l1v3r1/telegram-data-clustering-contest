      <p><i>Joker</i> star Joaquin Phoenix has revealed if he’d potentially star in a sequel to the acclaimed comic book melodrama.</p>
      <p>The movie, which stars Phoenix as Gotham’s Clown Prince of Crime, debuted to wide acclaim last month – <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/joker-review-a-melancholic-psychodrama-punctuated-by-splashes-of-shocking-violence">including a five star review from NME.</a></p>
      <p>It then went on to become the <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/joker-become-highest-grossing-r-rated-movie-ever-made-2559965">highest r-rated movie of all time</a>, after securing over $700 million at the global box office.</p>
      <p>But despite the success, Phoenix insists that he’d only take part in a sequel if he deemed it to be a worthy successor.</p>
      <p>Speaking to<i> The Envelope </i>(via <i><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-01/joker-sequel-joaquin-phoenix-fan-theories">LA Times</a></i>)<i>, </i>Phoenix admitted: “I wouldn’t just do a sequel just because the first movie is successful, that’s ridiculous.”</p>
      <p>However, he’s definitely discussed the prospect of a follow-up with director Todd Phillips.</p>

      <p>“Long before the release or before we had any idea if it would be successful, we talked about sequels,” he said.</p>
      <p>This comes after Phillips said that the quality of Phoenix’s striking performance meant that a follow-up could be on the cards.</p>
      <p>“One thing I will tell you: I would do anything with [Phoenix], any day of the week,” he explained to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/joker-2-movie-sequel-todd-phillips-interview/"><i>Total Film</i></a>. “There’s nobody like him.</p>
      <p>“If he was willing to do [a sequel], and if people show up to this movie, and Warners came to us and said, ‘You know what?</p>
      <p>If you guys could think of something…’ Well, I have a feeling that he and I could think of something pretty cool.”</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/joker-review-a-melancholic-psychodrama-punctuated-by-splashes-of-shocking-violence"><i>NME</i>‘s five-star ‘Joker’ review</a>, Greg Wetherall described the film as an “instant classic”, declaring that “the <a href="http://nme.com/tag/dc-extended-universe">DC Extended Universe</a> have made a picture destined to challenge <a href="http://nme.com/tag/marvel-cinematic-universe">Marvel</a>’s dominance.”</p>
