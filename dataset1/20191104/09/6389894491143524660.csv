‘Distressing decline’: UK construction sector contracts again
04 Nov 2019, 09:39 by Harry Robertson
The UK construction sector continued its decline in October, survey data has shown, with overall volumes of work falling for the sixth straight month.
The construction purchasing managers’ index (PMI) – a gauge of the health of the sector – registered 44.2 in October, up from 43.3 in September, data firm IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) showed.
A score of below 50 indicates contraction, meaning the construction sector is in sustained decline, and still not far off the 10-year low seen in June.
Civil engineering was the worst-performing area, with business activity falling at the sharpest pace in 10 years.
