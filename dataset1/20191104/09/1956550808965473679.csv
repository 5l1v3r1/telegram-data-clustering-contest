Or if you’re dining with an equally peckish diner, opt for any burger meal and you’ll get one 6oz classic burger sandwich absolutely free. Pass us that ketchup, it’s going to get messy.Open Sat-Wed noon-midnight, Thu-Fri noon-2am. Burj Daman Building, DIFC (04 514 8838).Original Wings & RingsDoing exactly what is says on the tin, this casual DIFC bar is a huge hit with wing-lovers. The all-American hangout offers a variety of delicious sauces at varying spice levels, including one that you have to sign a waiver for as it’s that hot. For Dhs199, throughout November you can enjoy unlimited numbers of these lip-lickingly tasty meaty wings and bottomless hops to wash them all down with – and to take the edge of the spiciness.Offer valid from 4pm-8pm.

Hilton Dubai Al Habtoor City (04 435 5577).The BlacksmithThere’s no shortage of Deep South-inspired meateries in this city, but The Blacksmith is among the most authentic in town so if you’re mad about meat, this is the deal for you. Sample the belly-busting Texas Brisket Sandwich – a fresh potato roll layered with 14-hour smoked brisket and topped with pickles, onions and barbecue sauce, and a pint for just Dhs69. Lip-smackingly good, all for under Dhs100.Open Sun-Wed 5pm-2am, Thu-Sat 5pm-3am. Wyndham Dubai Marina, Dubai Marina (04 407 8873).
