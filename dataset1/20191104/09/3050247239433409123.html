      <h1>Crypto Exchange OKEx Is Listing Tezos With Bitcoin, Tether Pairs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T09:19:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 09:19</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>The world’s <a href="https://coin360.com/exchanges/table?group=Verified">3rd largest</a> <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrency-exchange">crypto exchange</a> <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/okex">OKEx</a> has announced it will be listing Tezos (<a href="https://coin360.com/coin/tezos-xtz">XTZ</a>) later this week.</p>
      <p>In an announcement shared with Cointelegraph on Nov. 4, OKeX said that XTZ deposits will be available as of 09.000 UTC on Nov. 6, with XTZ spot trading against Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) and Tether (<a href="https://coin360.com/coin/tether-usdt">USDT</a>) to launch at 9.00 UTC on Nov. 7. </p>
      <p>XTZ withdrawals will be functional from 09.00 UTC on Nov. 8.</p>
      <h3>Driving participation</h3>
      <p>Tezos — founded by former Morgan Stanley analyst Arthur Breitman and Kathleen Breitman — is a multi-purpose blockchain platform that supports decentralized applications and smart contracts. </p>
      <p>The open-source protocol uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, with stakeholders able to govern upgrades to the core protocol and governance structures in a way that avoids having to hard fork the blockchain. These principles of sustainable flexibility and open participation are ostensibly intended to drive the widespread adoption of the technology. </p>
      <p>In a statement, OKex Head of Operations Andy Cheung said:</p>
      <blockquote>“Tezos is a highly respected project with a robust community, and we’re happy to be able to add the value of the XTZ network to the OKEx ecosystem.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Binance’s prior moves</h3>
      <p>OKex’s listing of Tezos follows its recent <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/okex-to-launch-usdt-futures-trading-with-up-to-100x-leverage">announcement</a> of plans to launch Tether futures trading, offering a linear futures contract with leverage of up to 100x. USDT Futures Contracts will be launched on Nov. 14, with USDT Perpetual Swaps slated for Nov. 30.</p>
      <p>This fall, OKEx was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/okex-slams-new-wash-trading-allegations-as-inaccurate-and-misleading">prompted</a> to refute fresh allegations from the Blockchain Transparency Institute that wash trading is purportedly rife on its platform.</p>
      <p>In late September, Binance <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-lists-tezos-with-3-xtz-pairs-ceo-hints-at-staking-soon">listed</a> Tezos trading, with pairs against Tether, Bitcoin and native exchange token Binance Coin (<a href="https://coin360.com/coin/binance-coin-bnb">BNB</a>). The exchange swiftly followed the listing with a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-exchange-binance-launches-dedicated-staking-platform">rollout</a> of a dedicated staking platform, enabling its users to stake their holdings (in custodial wallets) and earn rewards without having to set up their own nodes.</p>
      <p>In October, Binance’s research arm <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-research-ethereums-switch-to-staking-will-transform-industry">argued</a> the case for the transformative impact that staking will have on the crypto industry, proposing that Ethereum’s pending switch to the algorithm will accelerate the process.</p>
