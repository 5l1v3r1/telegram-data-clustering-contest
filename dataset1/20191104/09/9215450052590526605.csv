考慮移民台灣？台灣生活的五個優點
最近身邊多朋友都講起移民。其中一個熱門的地方是台灣移民，優點很多。首先，地理上很近，只需要一個多小時飛機就到，總好過英美澳加等要搭成日飛機。其次，都是華人地方，生活習慣與文化，跟香港非常接近，就算你唔識講國語，攞部手機出來寫字都溝通到，總好過去泰國、韓國等，雞同鴨講。
第三，近期考慮移民的港人最渴求的，可以享受高度的民主及自由。第四，港人最羡慕的，生活壓力比較低，社會福利及保障也比較完善，慢活人生。第五，門檻比較低，基本600萬新台幣，台灣移民大約150萬港元就可以申請投資移民。

移民台灣好嗎？ 你睇我好，我睇你好！
筆者有不少朋友台灣移民。然而大部份成功移民後，都急不及待回流。亦有少部份朋友，由於早年已到台灣升讀大學，早已習慣了台灣的生活，可以順順利利在台灣移民落地生根。過去十年，筆者亦曾夥拍一些台灣朋友，嘗試在當地搞生意，曾經做過網站、足球館、密室逃脫等業務，對台灣都算有比較深入的認識，結論是…
我們想到台灣，同時不少台灣人想出走。不是說台灣不好，只是不同人有不同追求。最記得第一盤在台灣的生意，是搞網站，創辦人是一對年青的台灣夫婦，筆者稱呼他們為站長、站長夫人。
在網站生意上軌道不久，他們就說想要移民，首目標是新加坡，理由響往當地的生活；其次是上海、香港，吸引他們的不是生活，而是發展機會。在茶館傾咗成晚，深入了解他們為甚麼想出走。以下的情況，都是土生土長的台灣人說的，不加不減。好記得，頭三個理由分別是…

政局混亂，發展原地踏步？
根據他們所講，每天打開電視睇新聞，都是無休止的爭拗，還有就是互挖醜聞，互相指罵、打架、鞠躬道歉。藍藍綠綠，不斷更替，藍營上台做幾年，經濟好，自主弱，然後就綠營上台做幾年，經濟差、自主強，無論誰當家都有很多不滿，來來回回，原地踏步。
風災與地震 生活多一份擔心
我們到台灣主要是旅遊，每年去幾日唔多覺，但在當地生活就必須要有危機意識，例如地震，是香港、新加坡等沒有的，例如颱風，由於地理位置不同，威力及破壞力都比香港、新加坡強。經濟差…出走尋求發展台灣的經濟發展多年來同樣是原地踏步。
收入、薪水水平較低
居民的收入水平很低，筆者有些台灣朋友，月薪6、7萬新台幣，即是2萬港元都不到，已經被朋友尊稱為高薪族了，大學畢業生人工亦只有6、7千港元。
這都是土生土長的台灣朋友說的，近年他們都順利移居外地了。還有一點，但想台灣移民的朋友要留意，所謂投資移民其實是不可以純投資的，需要經營生意。由於經濟長期不景氣，很多到台灣創業的朋友最後都敗走。
當然亦有成功的例子，總結他們的經驗，並不容易。想過優閒生活尋找小確幸，冇問題。想有大發展，就不容易了。如果你香港有資產，例如有樓收租，又或者有生意可以在家工作，即是可以做到在香港賺錢，在台灣移民生活，那就更適合。

Consider immigrating to Taiwan? Five advantages of Taiwanese life
Recently, many friends around me have talked about immigration. One of the most popular places is Taiwan immigrants, which have many advantages. First of all, geographically close, it only takes more than an hour to arrive by plane. It is better than the United States, the United States, Australia and Canada to build a Japanese plane. Secondly, they are all Chinese places, living habits and culture. They are very close to Hong Kong. Even if you know Mandarin, you can communicate with your mobile phone. It is always better to go to Thailand, South Korea, etc.
Third, the most eager for Hong Kong people considering immigration in the near future can enjoy a high degree of democracy and freedom. Fourth, the most envious of Hong Kong people, the pressure of life is relatively low, social welfare and security are relatively perfect, and life is slow. Fifth, the threshold is relatively low, basically 6 million Taiwan dollars, Taiwan immigrants about 1.5 million Hong Kong dollars can apply for investment immigration.

Immigration to Taiwan? You love me, I love you!
The author has many friends from Taiwan immigrants. However, after most successful immigration, they are eager to return. There are also a small number of friends who have already traveled to Taiwan to go to university in their early years. They have long been accustomed to life in Taiwan and can successfully take root in Taiwan. In the past ten years, the author has also teamed up with some Taiwanese friends to try to do business in the local area. I have done business in websites, football stadiums, secret rooms, etc., and I have a deeper understanding of Taiwan. The conclusion is...
We think of Taiwan, and many Taiwanese want to leave. It is not that Taiwan is not good, but different people have different pursuits. I remember the first business in Taiwan. I was engaged in a website. The founder was a young Taiwanese couple. The author called them the stationmaster and the stationmaster.
Soon after the website business, they said that they want to immigrate, the first goal is Singapore, the reason is to live in the local life; the second is Shanghai, Hong Kong, attracting them is not life, but development opportunities. In the teahouse, I went to the night to find out why they wanted to leave. The following situations are all said by the native Taiwanese, and they are not added. Remember, the first three reasons are...

Political chaos, development in place?
According to what they said, turning on the TV and breaking the news every day is an endless battle, and it is to dig up scandals, to blame each other, fight, and apologize. Blue, green and green, constantly changing, the blue camp to go on stage for a few years, the economy is good, the self-reliance, and then the green camp to go on stage for a few years, the economy is poor, self-reliant, no matter who is at home, there is a lot of dissatisfaction, come back and forth, stand still.
Wind and earthquake
When we go to Taiwan, we mainly travel, and we feel a lot of things every year. However, we must have a sense of crisis in our local life. For example, earthquakes are not available in Hong Kong, Singapore, etc., such as typhoons. Due to geographical location, power and destructive power Stronger than Hong Kong and Singapore. The economy is poor... The economic development of Taiwan seeking to develop Taiwan has also been in place for many years.
Low income and salary
Residents' income level is very low. I have some Taiwanese friends. The monthly salary is NT$60,000, which is 20,000 Hong Kong dollars. It has been called a high-wage family by friends, and the university graduates have only 6,000 or 7,000 Hong Kong dollars.
These are all native Taiwanese friends who have said that they have successfully moved to other places in recent years. Another point, but friends who want to immigrate to Taiwan should pay attention to the fact that the so-called investment immigrants can not be purely invested and need to run a business. Due to the long-term economic downturn, many friends who started their business in Taiwan finally lost.
Of course, there are also successful examples. It is not easy to summarize their experiences. I have thought about leisurely life and looking for a small fortunate, awkward problem. If you want to have great development, it will not be easy. If you have assets in Hong Kong, such as renting a building or having a business to work from home, you can make money in Hong Kong and live in Taiwan.
