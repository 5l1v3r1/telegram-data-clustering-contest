      <h1>Ciro Immobile doubt for Celtic clash as Lazio star suffers calf injury</h1>
      <h2>The 29-year-old suffered a slight calf strain against AC Milan and could miss out against Celtic.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T09:12:48+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 09:12</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Celtic could be handed a boost ahead of their Europa League clash with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lazio">Lazio</a> after Ciro Immobile picked up an injury.</p>
      <p>The striker scored as Lazio defeated AC Milan in Serie A but was then replaced in the latter stages.</p>
      <p>And reports in Italy suggest he could miss out on Thursday night's game in Rome to ensure he is fit for league action next weekend.</p>
      <p>It's unlikely that the injury is anything serious but Simone Inzaghi could take precautionary measures by leaving him out of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> clash.</p>

      <p>He told Rai Sport: "He had a small problem with his calf and I know how committed he is. I saw he was unsure when hitting a shot and I couldn't keep him on the pitch even if, being committed, he didn't want to come off."</p>
      <p>Immobile grabbed his 100th goal for Lazio in the win over AC Milan with Joaquin Correa scoring the winner late on after Bastos had scored an own goal.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> travel to Rome for the second of their games against Lazio after a 2-1 win in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Manuel Lazzari had opened the scoring for the Italian side before Ryan Christie and Christopher Jullien handed <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon's</a> men all three points.</p>
