      <p>Earlier in July this year, a similar kind of server fault was reported by Indigo, which left thousands of passengers stranded at the Bengaluru airport for more than half-an-hour.</p>
      <p>IndiGo has a total destination count of 83 with 60 domestic destinations and 23 international routes.</p>
      <p>The last few months, the company has been facing difficulties on several fronts including engine issues with  Airbus aircraft.</p>
      <p>Last week, India’s Aviation Watchdog ordered it to replace the engines of its entire<a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911011077199491-india-gives-ultimatum-to-biggest-airline-to-replace-faulty-airbus-engine/"> A320neo fleet of 97 aircraft</a> by 31 January "at all costs" or face grounding.</p>
      <p>India’s aviation watchdog the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has also asked the airline to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201905301075470334-india-ditches-american-engine-A320/">halt the introduction of around 300 Airbus</a> aircraft to comply with the engine replacement deadline.</p>
