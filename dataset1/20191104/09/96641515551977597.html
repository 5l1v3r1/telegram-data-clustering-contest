      <h1>Google's Assistant-friendly Nest WiFi router is available now</h1>
      <h2>Extend your network and fill your home with voice controls.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T09:30:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>You now have your chance to try Google's latest, Assistant-fueled take on home networking. As promised, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/15/google-nest-wifi-router-hybrid-smart-speaker-hands-on-price-specs-availability/">Nest WiFi</a> is now <a href="https://store.google.com/product/nest_wifi">available</a> through Google's store and other channels. You can buy the core router by itself for $169, but the system only really comes alive when you buy Points that both extend the mesh network and double as Google Assistant smart speakers. A standard pack with a router and one Point will cost you $269, while a three-pack will serve large homes for $349. You can buy further points for $149 online.</p>
      <p>Nest WiFi has its share of limitations. You won't find a wide array of Ethernet ports (there are just two) or USB (none). It's not going to deliver <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/03/the-next-generation-of-wireless-internet-will-be-called-wifi-6/">WiFi 6</a> speeds. And of course, you're making a deep investment in Google's ecosystem -- you'd be better off with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/25/amazons-new-eero-mesh-wifi-system-is-all-about-ease-of-use/">Eero hardware</a> if you're an Alexa fan. If you're building a smart home system from scratch, though, this could give you the foundations you need without having to buy separate networking gear and speakers.</p>
