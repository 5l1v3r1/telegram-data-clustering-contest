04 Nov 2019, 09:31 by Entertainment Desk
Singer Rabi Pirzada has bid farewell to the showbiz industry amid controversy surrounding her compromised images and videos.
Taking to Twitter, the singer wrote, “I, Rabi Pirzada, have decided to distance myself from the showbiz industry.”
She further wrote, “May Allah forgive my sins and soften others’ hearts towards me.” The singer also confirmed the decision to quit the showbiz industry while talking to The Express Tribune.




How it all began

Last week,  ‘compromising videos’ of Pirzada went viral on social media. While a huge number of users called her out for ‘profanity’ others came out in her support and slammed the breach of privacy.
#RabiPirzada was the top trend in the country on Friday, with Twitter users hitting out at the breach.
Aurat Haq, a Karachi-based activist group also released a statement condemning the violation of privacy, as well as the abuse of trust in an intimate relationship.
“We condemn the weaponising of a woman’s body against her for revenge porn. While we’re on the subject – let’s deconstruct why we shame women for their expression of sexuality,” the statement went on to say.
Rights activist Nighat Dad also weighed in, saying that those who are weaponising non-consensual intimate images and videos and forwarding them are committing a crime under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016.
“Don’t be a silent bystander, report these tweets and do not forward this violence,” she said.
