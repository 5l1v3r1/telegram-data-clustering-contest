Kevin Magnussen on broken brake disc: ""I told you so!"" 
04 Nov 2019, 09:26 by Louis Shaw

Kevin Magnussen was forced out of the US Grand Prix with a brake failure. The Haas driver had told his team about an issue with his brake pedal but the problem wasn't looked into. 

""I had a long brake pedal and I asked them to look at it, but they couldn't see anything,"" he said to the media in Austin after the race. “The temperatures were alright. So I just continued and then the disc exploded.”



Magnussen responded over the team radio by saying, ""I told you so!"" 



Haas have had a tough season and will hope that things start to get better soon. 




“It's a disappointing result, but it didn't come completely unexpected. We know where we are at the moment and that is not where we want to be. As soon as the race starts, we go backwards.""  

Magnussen will hope that the teams 2020 season is more successful and that they can sort out their issues before the start of next season.
