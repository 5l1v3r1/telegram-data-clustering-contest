Outrage Online as India's Biggest Airline IndiGo's Servers Down Across the Country

04 Nov 2019, 09:49


New Delhi (Sputnik): IndiGo is India’s largest passenger airline with a market share of 48.2% as of September 2019. Since India inception in August 2006, the company has grown from a position of owning one plane to operating a fleet of 245 aircraft.

Major chaos reported from various airports across India as servers of the country’s low-cost airline Indigo were down for more than an hour on Monday morning. Travellers complained of chaotic experiences and, long queues at ticket counters while boarding.
In a statement the airline that has share of more than 48% in India’s aviation market said: “Our systems are down across the network. We are expecting the counters to be more crowded than usual. Please bear with us as we try to solve the issue as soon as possible.”












The company, however, did not reveal the cause of the service disruption.



Earlier in July this year, a similar kind of server fault was reported by Indigo, which left thousands of passengers stranded at the Bengaluru airport for more than half-an-hour.
IndiGo has a total destination count of 83 with 60 domestic destinations and 23 international routes.
The last few months, the company has been facing difficulties on several fronts including engine issues with  Airbus aircraft.
Last week, India’s Aviation Watchdog ordered it to replace the engines of its entire A320neo fleet of 97 aircraft by 31 January ""at all costs"" or face grounding.
India’s aviation watchdog the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has also asked the airline to halt the introduction of around 300 Airbus aircraft to comply with the engine replacement deadline.
