      <p>FUZHOU: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kidambi-Srikanth">Kidambi Srikanth</a> has decided to give China Open a miss but top Indian shuttlers PV Sindhu and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/saina-nehwal">Saina Nehwal</a> will have their task cut out when they begin their campaign at the USD 700,000 event, beginning on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Former world number one Srikanth was pitted against reigning two-time world championship and numero uno ranked Kento Momota of Japan in his opening round but he pulled out of the tournament.</p>
      <p>Srikanth will now feature at the Hong Kong Open World Tour Super 500, next week.</p>
      <p>Sindhu and Saina will once again be India's best bet as they look to put up a good show this week.</p>
      <p>All eyes will also be on men's doubles pair of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Satwiksairaj-Rankireddy">Satwiksairaj Rankireddy</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Chirag-Shetty">Chirag Shetty</a>, who had reached the finals at the French Open last month.</p>
      <p>Both Sindhu and Saina had made early exits in three successive tournaments at China, Korea and Denmark before somewhat regaining form with a quarterfinal finish at the French Open and the duo will be desperate to go deep in the draw.</p>
      <p>Sixth seed Sindhu, who claimed the World Championship gold in August, will begin her campaign against Germany's Yvonne Li, while eighth seed Saina will open against China's Cai Yan.</p>
      <p>Sindhu is likely to face either three-time World Champion Carolina Marin or World number one Tai Tzu Ying in the quarterfinals if she clears the initial rounds.</p>
      <p>Saina, on the other hand, might come across Japan's second seed <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Akane-Yamaguchi">Akane Yamaguchi</a> in the last-eight but has to trump her opponents in the first two rounds.</p>
      <p>The BWF World Tour Super 750 tournament will also feature a host of Indian male shuttlers as they vie for honours this week.</p>
      <p>B Sai Praneeth, who had won a bronze at the World championships, will face Tommy Sugiarto of Indonesia.</p>
      <p>Sameer Verma will square off against Hong Kong's Lee Cheuk Yiu, while HS Prannoy, who recently recovered from a bout of dengue, is up against Rasmus Gemke of Denmark.</p>
      <p>Former Commonwealth Games champion <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Parupalli-Kashyap">Parupalli Kashyap</a>, who had reached the semifinals at India Open and Korea Open, will face Thailand's Sitthikom Thammasin in the opening round.</p>
      <p>In doubles, Satwik and Chirag will look to continue their good run as they open against Korean combination of Kim Gi Jung and Lee Yong Dae.</p>
      <p>Manu Attri and B Sumeeth Reddy will face Malaysian pairing of Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik in the first round.</p>
      <p>Women's doubles pair of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ashwini-Ponnappa">Ashwini Ponnappa</a> and N Sikki Reddy will meet China's Li Wen Mei and Zheng Yu, while Satwik and Ashwini will take on Canadian pair of Joshua Hurlburt-Yu and Josephine Wu in the mixed doubles.</p>
      <p>Another mixed doubles pair of Pranaav Jerry Chopra and Sikki will face off against Chinese Taipei's Wang Chi-Lin and Cheng Chi Ya.</p>
