      <p>Officials in the conservative Indonesian province of Aceh are outraged over a brazen protest against their religious ideals by a man, who appears to be a foreigner, who snuck in his message — and more — on Google Street View.</p>
      <p>Recently, Aceh citizens discovered a user-submitted photo on Google Street View from a cafe on Jalan Taman Makam Pahlawan in the province’s capital of Banda Aceh. The unidentified man in the photo appeared to be butt-naked, and he held to the camera a handwritten message on his left palm that read, “Protest sharia law.”</p>
      <p>The photo was accessible this morning, but appears to have been removed as of the time of writing this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Banda Aceh Mayor Aminullah Usman said the city administration called on citizens to report the photo in order to have Google remove it. </p>
      <p>“The city administration is asking for legal experts to give their opinion on possibly reporting those responsible for providing a platform for the photo, and the user who uploaded the content,” Aminullah told reporters today.</p>
      <p>The Aceh Regional Council (DPR Aceh) also strongly condemned the photo.</p>
      <p>“There’s an indication of insulting our region, which, to this day, is committed to Islamic sharia as a way of life,” DPR Aceh Deputy Speaker Safaruddin said.</p>
      <p>“I think this was deliberate.”</p>
      <p>Aceh is the only province in the world’s biggest Muslim-majority nation that imposes sharia law, part of a 2005 autonomy deal with the central government that ended a decades-long separatist insurgency.</p>
      <p>Since then, the province has been known around the world for its strict enforcement of sharia law, such as flogging citizens for drinking alcohol, engaging in adultery or pre-marital sex, and having gay sex.</p>
