      <p>A photographer hopes to track down a picture perfect family whose memories, dating back decades, have been discovered in his attic.</p>
      <p>When Martin Mcmenemy, 66, bought two second-hand telescopic lenses from a shop near <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stirling">Stirling Castle</a> 40 years ago, he got more than he bargained for.</p>
      <p>Alongside the lenses Martin, from Denny, near <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/falkirk">Falkirk</a>, was handed a box of old slides, all for £5.</p>
      <p>All 204 slides sat in his attic gathering dust, until garage owner Martin ­discovered that the slides show <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/photography">fascinating images</a> of the one family.</p>

      <p>Now Martin is hopeful Record readers can help reunite the family and photos.</p>
      <p>He said: “I had a big clear-out with my wife Sylvia.</p>
      <p>“I came across the slides and thought I’d put them through my old projector. I couldn’t believe what was on them.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glencoe">Glencoe</a>, Mull, Oban, Iona, Duart Castle and Staffa all feature on the snaps.</p>
      <p>Names mentioned on the cases are Colonel and Mrs Armstrong, David and Janet Agnew, Inga, Heather and Margaret.</p>

      <p>While 59 of the slides are Agfacolor glass slides, 145 are Kodachrome.</p>
      <p>Martin thinks the shots were taken between 1961 and 1964.</p>
      <p>He added: “While some of the people could be long dead, the young ones might be in their 60s. To get all these memories back would be great for them.”</p>
