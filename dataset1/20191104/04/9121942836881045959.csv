BALTIMORE (AP) — A Maryland pediatrician has been convicted of sexually abusing an 18-year-old patient he had been treating since she was a baby.
News outlets report Dr. Ernesto Torres was convicted Friday of second-degree assault and fourth-degree sexual offense of a patient. He was found not guilty of second-degree rape.
Prosecutor Charles Smith says the judge ruled the pediatrician didn’t use force during the assault, so found him not guilty of the rape charge. Sentencing is set for next month.
Authorities say Torres’ initial indictment over the April assault led 11 more victims to come forward. He’s since been indicted on 65 other charges, including 43 counts of third-degree sex offenses and nine counts of child sex abuse. WBAL-TV reports the allegations span Torres entire medical career, starting in 1979.
