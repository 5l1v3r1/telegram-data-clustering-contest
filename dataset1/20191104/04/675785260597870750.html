      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T04:08:51+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 04:08</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>A tattoo addict went blind for three weeks after undergoing an agonising procedure to turn her eyes blue.</p>
      <p>Amber Luke, 24, from Central Coast, New South Wales, Australia, has spent £13,901 on transforming her looks, having her tongue split, earlobes stretched and other 'modifications'.</p>
      <p>These include 200 tattoos, a boob job, lip and cheek fillers and ear spike implants, however getting her eyes tattooed was the most painful of them all.</p>
      <p>Ms Luke, who refers to herself as the 'Blue Eyed White Dragon', said: "I can't even begin to describe to you what the feeling was like.</p>

      <p>"The best thing I can give you is once the eyeball was penetrated with the ink, it felt like (the tattoo artist) grabbed 10 shards of glass and rubbed it in my eye.</p>
      <p>"That happened four times per eye, that was pretty brutal. Unfortunately, my artist went too deep into my eyeball."</p>
      <p>She added that the procedure does not cause blindness if done correctly, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7644079/Amber-Luke-reveals-went-BLIND-getting-blue-tattoos-eyeballs.html">Mail Online</a> reports.</p>

      <p>The ordeal has put the Australian off undergoing further extreme body modifications, although she plans to keep getting tattoos until she is fully covered.</p>
      <p>Ms Luke's mum, Vikki, broke down in tears after finding out about about her daughter's eyeball treatment.</p>
      <p>Vikki said she questioned why her daughter took the risk, however she has accepted that there is nothing she can do to deter her.</p>

      <p>The mother emphasised that she just wanted to support her daughter, who never saw herself as beautiful while growing up.</p>
      <p>Ms Luke said she has no regrets about her 10-year transformation.</p>
      <p>The 'body modifier' claims to have received a mix of negative and positive feedback from strangers about her looks.</p>
