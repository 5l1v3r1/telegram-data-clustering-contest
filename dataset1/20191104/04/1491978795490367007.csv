Relentless Ravens hand Patriots their first loss of the season
04 Nov 2019, 04:34 by Associated Press

New England Patriots 20-37 Baltimore Ravens
Vaunted New England defense unable to stop Baltimore
49ers are now only undefeated team in the NFL

The New England Patriots’ unbeaten season came to an end under the weight of their own mistakes and an inability to contain Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson, who ripped apart the NFL’s stingiest defense with his arm and legs in a 37-20 victory Sunday night.
Baltimore (6-2) zipped to an early 17-0 lead and let the Patriots (8-1) creep within striking distance before quelling the comeback with a 70-yard fumble return by Marlon Humphrey and a five-yard touchdown pass from Jackson to Nick Boyle early in the fourth quarter. That made it 30-20, and not even six-time Super Bowl winner Tom Brady could drag New England out of the hole. Brady, who went 30 for 46 for 285 yards, threw an interception with 12:47 left. Jackson then led a methodical drive that lasted nearly 10 minutes and ended with his thrust into the end zone from the one-yard line.
Jackson ran for 61 yards and two touchdowns and went 17 for 23 for 163 yards and a score. Mark Ingram ran for 115 yards, and the NFL’s leading rushing attack amassed 210 yards on the ground.
And so ended New England’s 12-game winning streak, dating to last season and including the playoffs.
