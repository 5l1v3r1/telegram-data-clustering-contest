千島之國菲律賓的「貿易內戰」：嚴防豬瘟疫區省份運豬肉至各島
04 Nov 2019, 04:54 by 江順楠


我們想讓你知道的是非洲豬瘟仍然在世界各地蔓延，尤其是東亞和東南亞地區。在鄰近國家紛紛淪陷時，這場長期戰役對台灣而言格外嚴峻。藉由菲律賓的例子，可以讓台灣讀者更了解防疫的過程和許多潛在的影響。



菲律賓在2019年9月9日正式成為最新的非洲豬瘟疫區。目前為止，亞太地區的疫區還包括中國、越南、寮國、柬埔寨、越南、緬甸、南韓和北韓。
在當時的記者會上，菲律賓政府宣佈，送往英國檢驗的20個檢體中，有14個都驗出病毒，因此幾乎可以確定病毒已經進入菲律賓的養豬場中。菲律賓政府也隨即成立緊急應變單位，在病死豬被發現地區的周圍一公里內，屠殺了7000多隻豬，希望能遏止疫情擴散。根據後續推測，病毒來源應該是來自馬尼拉地區的廚餘。
值得玩味的是，在正式公布之前，這個消息其實已經流傳了一陣子，台灣政府在此前幾週就將菲律賓來台班機納入隨身行李查驗的名單中。當時，菲律賓政府的回應是，沒有確認有豬瘟的發生，也不知道台灣政府是從哪個管道獲得這個消息，不過他們還是尊重台灣的決定。換句話說，在消息正式披露前，政府單位應該就有了一定程度的準備。
菲律賓政府可能也早已預期這一天的到來。大約一年半前，我有一次和菲律賓朋友吃飯，剛好其中一個朋友在畜牧產業擔任獸醫，他當時就顯得憂心忡忡，覺得這個防線遲早會守不住，只是不知道確切時間，也只希望情況不要惡化太快才好。
防疫措施和疫情概況
和台灣政府一樣，菲律賓政府面對非洲豬瘟在亞洲的蔓延也是如臨大敵，採取許多防範措施來防堵病毒入境，其中甚至包括了對所有航行在西菲律賓海的船隻（包括漁船和郵輪等）進行強制檢查，因為常常有漁民會在海上交易一些中國產品。
在當時，菲律賓政府的防疫措施也引發了一些反彈，有一件事情引起特別多討論。有一個菲律賓移工從香港帶回了32罐豬肉罐頭，被海關查獲，結果在當場因為一個具有高度政治勢力的知名電台主持人Raffy Tulfo的介入，這些罐頭居然被還給了這個移工！於是菲律賓政府事後還得追查這些罐頭的下落。同時，這件事情也被當時的菲律賓農業部長Emmanuel Piñol在他的臉書披露。Piñol當時試著將這個事件視為一個好的宣傳機會，希望藉由Tulfo的知名度，讓更多海外移工知道有關豬肉的禁令；進一步，菲律賓農業部也趁機希望鼓勵菲律賓人多多購買菲律賓的豬肉，支持在地豬農！
當然，菲律賓的豬農現在已經進入了完全不同的戒備狀態。菲律賓的非洲豬瘟疫情沒有在最一開始時得到控制，仍然持續延燒，除了最一開始發現病死豬的Rizal省和Bulacan省（緊臨馬尼拉都會區西北邊和東邊）之外，目前病毒往北已經擴散到呂宋島中部的 Pangasinan 省，往南則抵達馬尼拉都會區南邊的Cavite省。更糟糕的消息是，10月15日時菲律賓官方實驗室在三種豬肉加工食品中驗出了非洲豬瘟病毒，表示已經有病死豬進入了下游加工製程中。長期而言，這會造成非洲豬瘟加速擴散也更難防堵。
目前，菲律賓政府採取的防範措施叫做「1-7-10」：病死豬地點周圍一公里內的所有豬隻都會被屠殺；禁止七公里以內所有豬隻任意移動；嚴格監控十公里內的豬隻狀況。同時，農業部也已經嚴格禁止將Bulacan省和Rizal省的豬肉載運到其他省去。
每個遭到非洲豬瘟病毒襲擊的國家大概都會執行類似的防堵策略以控制非洲豬瘟的蔓延。雖然成效如何還有待觀察，但在菲律賓內部已經可以看見許多後續效應。

爆發之後的影響
非洲豬瘟的影響層面很大也很廣泛，就目前來看，有底下幾個面向。
第一，消費層面：物價波動
菲律賓在2017年到2018年時，因為各種因素加乘，經歷了一波非常嚴重的通貨膨脹，雖然目前物價已經慢慢回穩，但是物價波動仍然是政策制定的主要考量因素。同時，菲律賓是全球第十大豬肉消費國，豬肉也是菲律賓人最常食用的肉類，這代表了非洲豬瘟對菲律賓人的日常飲食可能會帶來很大的衝擊。
也就是說，菲律賓政府在疫情開始時，除了要阻止疫情蔓延，同時卻也必須避免造成民眾恐慌而導致豬肉價格波動。因此，在9月9日宣布疫情的同時，農業部部長和健康部部長就聯合召開了一個記者會，用一種菲律賓傳統飲食boodle fight的形式跟民眾宣導：只要經過正常程序處理，豬肉就仍然安全可食，對人的身體不會有任何危害，這種穩定民心的活動後續在不同城市又舉辦了好幾次。
類似的考量也出現在最近的另一個決策。雖然菲律賓政府已經公佈，在某一個廠牌的加工肉品中檢驗出非洲豬瘟病毒，但是在輿論壓力下仍並不願意公佈公司名稱，某個層面上可能是不希望造成進一步的恐慌，但即使如此，各種預期效應已經造成雞肉價格上漲，最近一週內約上漲了1.7%；同時，產業界也預期今年雞肉的進口量將會成長27%；政府也已經預期明年的物價會因此顯著上漲。
第二，生產層面：對養豬業的衝擊
另一方面，非洲豬瘟對於菲律賓養豬產業可能會有深遠影響。菲律賓的養豬業規模比台灣大許多，也是菲律賓最主要的蓄牧產業，在2017年時，養豬產業佔了菲律賓18%的農業產出，僅次於稻米，也是全世界第八大養豬國，支撐起全菲律賓60%的肉品消費。
雖然目前受到影響而屠宰的豬隻只佔了整個養豬產業的0.5%左右，但是根據最新發布的統計，已經造成了兩千萬美元左右的損失；同時，因為有65%的豬隻生產於傳統家庭式養豬場（10隻以下），這些豬農更難承受潛在風險，因此傾向盡快拋售豬隻，也導致豬隻販售價格下降，讓養豬產業整體利潤下降。雪上加霜的是，在豬肉加工食品中檢驗出病毒的消息，讓一些地方政府打算禁止豬肉加工食品的販售，也促使一些豬肉加工公司已經開始拒絕使用菲律賓本地的豬隻當成肉品來源，這也對菲律賓養豬業造成進一步衝擊。
更長遠的影響將是養豬產業的結構。目前以家戶為單位的小型蓄產業對於這種傳染疾病的控制其實相當困難，另一方面，潛在的疾病風險也可能讓促使這些小生產戶轉移到其他產業去。因此，非洲豬瘟將會如何影響菲律賓之後的蓄產業結構值得持續觀察。
第三，政治層面：菲律賓國內的貿易戰？
非洲豬瘟帶來的其中一個意料之外的影響，可能是菲律賓境內的貿易衝突。
菲律賓是七千多個島組成的島國，其中兩千多個島有人居住。目前，已經有多個呂宋島之外的區域或甚至是呂宋島北部和南部的省政府和市政府，相繼透過行政命令宣布，禁止來自呂宋島或特定省份的豬肉及豬肉加工產品進入他們省內，主要目的是希望阻止非洲豬瘟蔓延到他們省內，波擊他們的養豬產業。菲律賓擁有一個相對分權的政治制度，因此省政府的決定確實可以造成實質影響，也因此，已經有許多人希望菲律賓總統可以出面協調出整體性的政策，但不論如何，這個爭議已經成為政治角力的戰場。
概括而言，從菲律賓面對非洲豬瘟時的各種挑戰可以發現，這個病毒牽連層面複雜且廣泛，尤其，在這個全球化的時代，各種人與物的跨國移動，都可能影響到病毒的遷徙傳播；病毒帶來的衝擊，也常常溢出國界範圍，不論是跨國市場的競逐或者對外來旅客的管理，都會因為不同的狀況而需要及時調整。這些也都是台灣在面對非洲豬瘟以及其他類似課題時，需要面對的挑戰和具備的視野。

""Trade Civil War"" in the Philippines of the Thousand Islands: Strictly prevent pigs in the plague-stricken areas from transporting pork to various islands
04 Nov 2019, 04:54 by Jiang Shunnan


What we want you to know is that African swine fever is still spreading around the world, especially in East Asia and Southeast Asia. When the neighboring countries fell, this long-term battle was particularly severe for Taiwan. With the example of the Philippines, Taiwanese readers can learn more about the epidemic prevention process and many potential impacts.



The Philippines officially became the latest African swine plague area on September 9, 2019. So far, the epidemic areas in the Asia-Pacific region include China, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar, South Korea and North Korea.
At the press conference at the time, the Philippine government announced that 14 of the 20 specimens sent to the UK for testing had detected the virus, so it was almost certain that the virus had entered the pig farm in the Philippines. The Philippine government also immediately set up an emergency response unit to kill more than 7,000 pigs within a kilometer of the area where the dead pigs were found, hoping to curb the spread of the epidemic. According to subsequent speculation, the source of the virus should be the food waste from the Manila region.
It is worth pondering that before the official announcement, the news has actually been circulated for a while. The Taiwanese government has included the Philippines flights to the list of carry-on baggage checks in the past few weeks. At that time, the Philippine government responded that it did not confirm the occurrence of piglets, and did not know which channel the Taiwan government obtained from the news, but they still respect Taiwan’s decision. In other words, government units should have a certain degree of preparation before the news is officially disclosed.
The Philippine government may have already expected this day. About a year and a half ago, I once had a meal with a Filipino friend. Just one of my friends was a veterinarian in the animal husbandry industry. He was worried at the time. He felt that this line of defense would not be able to keep it, but he didn’t know the exact time. It is good to deteriorate too fast.
Epidemic prevention measures and epidemic situation
Like the Taiwanese government, the Philippine government is also facing the spread of African swine fever in Asia. It has taken many precautions to prevent the entry of viruses, including even all vessels (including fishing boats and cruise ships) sailing in the West Philippine Sea. ) Compulsory inspections are carried out because fishermen often trade some Chinese products at sea.
At the time, the Philippine government's quarantine measures also triggered some rebounds, and one thing caused a lot of discussion. A Philippine migrant worker brought back 32 cans of pork cans from Hong Kong and was seized by the customs. As a result, the cans were actually returned to the work because of the involvement of Raffy Tulfo, a well-known radio host with high political power. So the Philippine government had to trace the whereabouts of these cans afterwards. At the same time, this matter was also disclosed in his Facebook by the then Philippine Agriculture Minister Emmanuel Piñol. Piñol tried to view the event as a good publicity opportunity, and hoped that through the popularity of Tulfo, more overseas migrants would know about the ban on pork. Further, the Philippine Department of Agriculture also took the opportunity to encourage Filipinos to buy more pork from the Philippines. Support the local pig farmers!
Of course, the pig farmers in the Philippines have now entered a completely different state of alert. The African swine fever epidemic in the Philippines was not controlled at the very beginning, and it continued to burn, except for the Rizal and Bulacan provinces (close to the northwest and east of the Manila metropolitan area) where the dead pigs were first discovered. It has spread to the province of Pangasinan in central Luzon, and to the south to the province of Cavite, south of the Manila metropolitan area. To make matters worse, on October 15th, the official laboratory of the Philippines tested the African swine fever virus in three kinds of pork processed foods, indicating that the dead pigs had entered the downstream processing process. In the long run, this will cause the spread of African swine fever to be more difficult to prevent.
At present, the Philippine government's precautionary measures are called ""1-7-10"": all pigs within one kilometer around the location of the dead pig will be slaughtered; all pigs within seven kilometers are prohibited from moving at will; pigs within 10 kilometers are strictly monitored. situation. At the same time, the Ministry of Agriculture has strictly prohibited the carriage of pork from the provinces of Bulacan and Rizal to other provinces.
Every country that has been hit by the African swine fever virus will probably implement a similar anti-blocking strategy to control the spread of African swine fever. Although the results remain to be seen, many follow-up effects are already visible within the Philippines.

Impact after the outbreak
The impact of African swine fever is very large and wide. For the time being, there are several aspects.
First, the consumption level: price fluctuations
From 2017 to 2018, the Philippines experienced a very serious inflation due to various factors. Although prices have slowly stabilized, price volatility remains the main consideration for policy making. At the same time, the Philippines is the tenth largest consumer of pork in the world. Pork is also the most commonly eaten meat of Filipinos. This represents that African swine fever may have a great impact on the daily diet of Filipinos.
In other words, the Philippine government, in addition to stopping the spread of the epidemic at the beginning of the epidemic, must also avoid causing panic among the people and causing fluctuations in pork prices. Therefore, at the same time as the epidemic was announced on September 9, the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of Health jointly held a press conference to publicize with the public in the form of a traditional diet boodle fight: as long as the normal procedures are followed, the pork remains It is safe and edible, and it will not cause any harm to the human body. This activity of stabilizing people's hearts has been held several times in different cities.
Similar considerations have emerged in another recent decision. Although the Philippine government has announced that the African swine fever virus has been tested in a processed meat of a certain brand, it is still not willing to publish the company name under the pressure of public opinion. At one level, it may not want to cause further panic, but Even so, various expected effects have caused chicken prices to rise, up about 1.7% in the past week. At the same time, the industry is also expected to increase its imports of chicken meat by 27% this year; the government has also expected prices to rise significantly next year.
Second, the production level: the impact on the pig industry
On the other hand, African swine fever may have a profound impact on the Philippine pig industry. The pig industry in the Philippines is much larger than Taiwan and the most important grazing industry in the Philippines. In 2017, the pig industry accounted for 18% of the Philippines' agricultural output, second only to rice, and the eighth largest in the world. The pig country supports 60% of the meat consumption in the Philippines.
Although pigs currently affected and slaughtered account for only about 0.5% of the entire pig industry, according to the latest statistics, it has caused losses of around 20 million US dollars; at the same time, because 65% of pigs are produced Traditional family pig farms (below 10), these pig farmers are more difficult to bear the potential risks, so the tendency to sell pigs as soon as possible, also led to a decline in the price of pigs sold, so that the overall profit of the pig industry declined. To make matters worse, the news of virus detection in pork processed foods has led some local governments to ban the sale of pork processed foods, and has prompted some pork processing companies to refuse to use local Philippine pigs as a source of meat. A further impact on the Philippine pig industry.
The longer-term impact will be the structure of the pig industry. At present, the small-scale storage industry based on households is actually quite difficult to control this infectious disease. On the other hand, the potential disease risk may also cause these small-scale producers to transfer to other industries. Therefore, how the African swine fever will affect the structure of the storage industry after the Philippines is worthy of continuous observation.
Third, the political level: the domestic trade war in the Philippines?
One of the unintended effects of African swine fever may be a trade conflict in the Philippines.
The Philippines is an island nation of more than 7,000 islands, of which more than 2,000 are inhabited. At present, there are already many provinces and municipalities outside Luzon Island or even the northern and southern parts of Luzon Island. They have announced through administrative orders that pork and pork processing products from Luzon or certain provinces are prohibited from entering. Their main purpose in the province is to prevent African swine fever from spreading to their provinces and to smash their pig industry. The Philippines has a relatively decentralized political system, so the decision of the provincial government can indeed have a substantial impact. Therefore, many people hope that the Philippine President can come forward to coordinate the overall policy, but in any case, this dispute has become a political wrangling. Battlefield.
In summary, from the challenges faced by the Philippines in the face of African swine fever, the virus is implicated in a complex and extensive range. In particular, in this era of globalization, the transnational movement of people and things may affect the migration of viruses. Communication; the impact of viruses often spills over national borders. Whether it is competition in a multinational market or management of foreign visitors, it needs to be adjusted in time due to different conditions. These are also the challenges and visions that Taiwan needs to face in the face of African swine fever and other similar issues.
