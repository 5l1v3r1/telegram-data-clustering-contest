      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T04:30:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McGivern, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcgivern/</a></address>
      <p>Scottish MPs at Westminster are demanding the urgent ­decriminalisation of drugs and the opening of safe drug consumption rooms to tackle ­Scotland’s drug deaths crisis.</p>
      <p>The recommendations of the ­cross-party Scottish affairs committee echo the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/its-time-decriminalise-drug-use-17386758">views of the Daily Record</a>, which came months before the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/snp-set-back-decriminalisation-drugs-20533500">SNP also adopted decriminalisation</a> as official party policy.</p>
      <p>Despite blocks on radical reforms by the Home Office, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/drugs">drugs</a> ­investigation also led to criticism of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/snp">Scottish Government</a>, which cut funding as deaths spiralled out of control under its watch.</p>
      <p>The Problem Drug Use report – published urgently before ­Parliament is dissolved – claims its recommendations should be adopted throughout the UK, as drug deaths elsewhere are also at historically high levels.</p>
      <p>Committee chairman Pete Wishart said: “<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/drugs-crime">Decriminalisation</a> is becoming the new normal and I am sure that is the way we’ll go in time.</p>
      <p>“I should point out that the public debate has changed dramatically in Scotland recently and that is in no small part down to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/snp-drug-decriminalisation-policy-welcomed-20578376">Daily Record</a>, which has taken a bold and brave stance on the drugs crisis.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>“The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-actor-brian-cox-backs-18921805">Record’s stories</a> have ­challenged the establishment and significantly changed the language and climate of the debate.”</p>
      <p>The Westminster investigation spoke to many witnesses who have already featured in the Record’s own investigation into Scotland’s drug deaths, which reached 1187 last year – the highest death rate of any nation in the world.</p>
      <p>Members<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scotlands-drug-crisis-portugal-started-16533544"> followed us to Portugal</a> to hear of the benefits brought there by ­decriminalisation and talked to drug reformers in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/legalised-cannabis-moves-closer-uk-18797066">Ottawa, Canada</a>, and Frankfurt, Germany.</p>
      <p>The committee visited <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> to hear of open-air heroin dens that we highlighted, with needles strewn yards from the proposed site of a drug ­consumption room (DCR), which has been blocked by the UK Government.</p>
      <p>In the report, Wishart stresses the need for decriminalisation and urged the next UK Government to declare a public health ­emergency to enable faster reform.</p>
      <p>He adds: “If this number of people were being killed by any other illness, the Government would declare it as a public health issue and act accordingly.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The evidence is clear – the criminal justice approach does not work.</p>
      <p>“Decriminalisation is a pragmatic ­solution to problem drug use; reducing stigma around drug use and addiction, and encouraging people to seek ­treatment.</p>
      <p>“The health and social care committee also said the Government should consider decriminalisation.</p>
      <p>It reflects the weight of evidence, and I hope the next Government takes this recommendation seriously.”</p>
      <p>On DCRs, where addicts can inject in safety and dispose of needles while consulting with medical staff, the report claims the evidence is “overwhelming”.</p>
      <p>It argues that while these facilities do not come without challenges and are not a silver bullet, they could be a ­cost-effective solution to the drug crisis.</p>

      <p>It states that if the UK Government is unwilling to lawfully establish a safe consumption facility pilot in Scotland, powers over drugs legislation should be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.</p>
      <p>In the report, Wishart adds: “The Home Office’s decision to block the introduction of a safe drug ­consumption facility in Glasgow, despite the record number of drug deaths in Scotland, is deeply regrettable, and we hope that they will reconsider.”</p>
      <p>The group’s report also rebuked the SNP Government, which has been in power as the death rate rose from 455 in 2007 to 1187 in 2018.</p>
      <p>Wishart, who is seeking re-election as an SNP MP, says: “Though there is plenty of action the UK Government must take to tackle drug use, the Scottish ­Government must ensure that health services are properly funded, and that funding cuts are not ­worsening the problem.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The report slams the cutting of Alcohol and Drug ­Partnerships budgets in the 2016-17 Scottish Government budget, which made the situation worse.</p>
      <p>It adds: “If the Scottish Government wants to call for more powers to tackle the drug crisis, it must ­demonstrate that it is doing everything within the powers it already has.”</p>
      <p>The inquiry heard from academics, ­individuals and families with ­experience of drug use, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/decriminalisation-drug-use-decision-hailed-20635822">charity groups</a>, service agencies and police forces.</p>
      <p>The welfare policies of the ­Department for Work and Pensions – <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/drug-laws-dont-work-experts-14313911">particularly Universal Credit</a> – are also criticised for their effect on people who use drugs.</p>
      <p>A Home Office ­spokesperson said: “The Government has no plans to decriminalise drug possession.</p>
      <p>“It would not eliminate the crime committed by the illicit trade nor would it address the harms ­associated with drug dependence and the misery that this can cause to families and communities.</p>
      <p>“There is no legal framework for the ­provision of drug ­consumption rooms as a range of crimes would be committed in the course of running such a facility.”</p>
