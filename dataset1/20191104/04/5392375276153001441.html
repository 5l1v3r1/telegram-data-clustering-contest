      <p>Specifically, WhatsApp can now play trailers in its picture-in-picture player when a direct link of a Netflix content is posted in a chat. At least for the trailer, you are no longer re-directed to the Netflix app, which actually seems a very cool idea.</p>
      <h3>WhatsApp shows Netflix trailer</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-to-start-streaming-trailer-videos-from-netflix/">According to WABetaInfo, </a>
        <i>WhatsApp has implemented the ability to stream directly into WhatsApp trailers from Netflix. When you share a compatible Netflix link, it displays a large thumbnail with a play icon. “</i>
      </p>
      <p>As of now, playing Netflix videos directly on WhatsApp is only available for iOS devices. In addition, you must have the latest version of the App. As of now, this messenger is able to play videos from YouTube, Facebook and Instagram links directly within the app. Presumably, Netflix will add more services, but the developers are not particularly open or commenting on this.</p>
