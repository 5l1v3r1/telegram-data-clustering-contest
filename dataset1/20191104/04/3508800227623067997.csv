新加坡在野黨圖組聯盟抗人民行動黨一黨獨大，觀察家：仍不構成威脅
04 Nov 2019, 04:24 by 關鍵評論網 ASEAN：馬六甲


我們想讓你知道的是新加坡大選最遲2021年4月舉行，而各界預期李顯龍政府可能提前舉行選舉。而新加坡部分反對黨11月2日會商合作事宜，外傳各反對黨可能未來大選以同一旗幟參選受到關注。



（中央社）新加坡部分反對黨11月2日會商合作事宜，未來大選是否不排除以同一旗幟參選受到關注。不過，觀察家分析，選區劃分尚未出爐，反對黨能否籌組聯盟參選，仍言之過早。
新加坡大選最遲2021年4月舉行，普遍預期選舉可能提前。新加坡9月間已成立選區範圍檢討委員會（EBRC），預料一般會在2個月到4個月內提出檢討報告，大選通常會在檢討報告出爐後2個月舉行。
甫成立的新加坡前進黨黨魁陳清木昨天邀集國民團結黨、革新黨、人民力量黨、國人為先黨等20多名反對黨人士會商大選事宜，探討如何在大選中發揮團結力量。不過，工人黨與民主黨並未受邀。

曾於2015年投入國會大選的工人黨候選人陳家喜今天告訴中央社記者，新加坡每逢大選前，不乏傳出反對黨有意籌組聯盟等相關報導。如就目前情勢觀察，不論反對黨是否籌組聯盟，共同以同一旗幟參選，其實對執政的人民行動黨不會構成太大威脅，也言之過早。
他分析，除工人黨與民主黨外，其他的反對黨均未形成氣候，無論在人力與組織動員等方面都羽翼未豐。即便部分的反對黨最終組聯盟參選，最多僅具形式，實際成效不大。
陳家喜分析，這些反對黨籌組聯盟，僅是為了因應「大選」成立，並非以「執政」為目的而成立聯盟，無論投入大選的人力、資金與政策目標，都無法和執政黨匹敵。
星媒報導昨天會商目的只是初步討論大選即將面對的諸多事宜，現階段沒有討論「三角戰」。不過，陳家喜受訪認為，大選合作模式是這群反對黨商討的目的，多半關注如何避開反對黨共同競逐同一選區的「三腳戰」或「多腳戰」。
陳家喜強調，陳清木與部分反對黨協商舉措並不令人意外，協商是要避免與其他政黨因重疊而衝突，這也是為新加坡前進黨投入大選預做準備，並確保每個反對黨獲益拿到議席，「從大選中分到一杯羹」。
新加坡上屆大選於2015年舉行，這屆大選最遲將於2021年4月舉行。2015年大選有諸多反對黨投入大選，僅工人黨獲少數席位，人民行動黨仍掌握絕大多數議席。

Singapore’s opposition party group alliance, the anti-People’s Action Party’s one-party, observer: still does not pose a threat
04 Nov 2019, 04:24 by Key Commentary ASEAN: Malacca


What we want you to know is that the Singapore general election will be held in April 2021 at the latest, and it is expected that the Lee Hsien Loong government may hold elections in advance. Some opposition parties in Singapore will discuss cooperation on November 2, and the opposition parties may be concerned about the election of the same banner in the future general election.



(Central News Agency) Some opposition parties in Singapore will discuss cooperation on November 2nd. Whether the future general election will not rule out the election of the same flag is concerned. However, observers have analyzed that the division of constituencies has not yet been released, and it is still too early to say whether the opposition party can organize a coalition for election.
The Singapore general election is held no later than April 2021. It is widely expected that the election may be advanced. In Singapore, the Constituency Scope Review Committee (EBRC) was established in September. It is expected that a review report will be submitted within two months to four months. The general election will usually be held two months after the review report is released.
Chen Qingmu, the founding leader of the Singapore Kadima Party, yesterday invited more than 20 opposition parties including the National Unity Party, the Reform Party, the People's Power Party, and the Chinese People First Party to discuss the general election and discuss how to play a united force in the general election. However, the Workers’ Party and the Democratic Party were not invited.
The Singapore Media Lianhe Zaobao reported that Chen Qingmu invited some opposition parties to discuss and did not rule out the possibility of participating in the general election under the same banner.

Chen Jiaxi, a candidate for the Workers’ Party who had been in the parliamentary election in 2015, told the Central News Agency that there were no reports from the opposition parties that they wanted to organize alliances and other reports before the election. As for the current situation, no matter whether the opposition party organizes alliances or jointly vote for the same banner, it will not pose too much threat to the ruling PAP. It is too early.
He analyzed that except for the Workers' Party and the Democratic Party, the other opposition parties did not form a climate, and they were fledgling in terms of manpower and organizational mobilization. Even if some of the opposition parties eventually form a coalition, they will only have a form at most, and the actual results will be small.
Chen Jiaxi analyzed that these opposition parties have organized alliances only to meet the ""general elections"" and not to establish alliances for the purpose of ""ruling"". No matter the manpower, capital and policy objectives of the election, they cannot compete with the ruling party.
Star Media reported that the purpose of the business yesterday was only to discuss a lot of issues that the election will face. At this stage, there is no discussion on the ""Triangle War."" However, Chen Jiaxi was interviewed that the mode of cooperation in the election is the purpose of this group of opposition parties, and most of them are concerned about how to avoid the ""three-footed war"" or ""multi-footed war"" in which the opposition parties compete for the same constituency.
Chen Jiaxi stressed that it is not surprising that Chen Qingmu and some of the opposition parties have negotiated measures. The consultation is to avoid conflicts with other political parties because of the overlap. This is also preparing for the election of the Singapore Kadima Party and ensuring that each opposition party benefits to get seats. ""Get a piece of the pie from the election.""
The last general election in Singapore was held in 2015. The election will be held in April 2021 at the latest. In the 2015 general election, many opposition parties entered the general election. Only the Workers’ Party won a minority seat, and the PAP still holds the majority of seats.
