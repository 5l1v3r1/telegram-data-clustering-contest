      <h3>Ripple Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>After facing resistance near $0.3000, ripple started a fresh downward move. XRP price traded below the $0.3000 support area to move into a short term bearish zone. Moreover, there was a close below the $0.3000 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>Finally, the price traded below the $0.2950 support area and tested the $0.2880 support zone. The recent low was formed near $0.2889 and the price is currently correcting higher.</p>
      <p>An immediate resistance is near the $0.2930 level and the 100 hourly SMA. The next key resistance area is near the $0.2940 level. Besides, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.2981 high to $0.2889 low is near the $0.2935 level.</p>
      <p>More importantly, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.2945 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The trend line coincides with the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.2981 high to $0.2889 low.</p>
      <p>Therefore, an upside break above the $0.2950 zone is needed for the bulls to take over. In the mentioned case, ripple could recover and trade towards the $0.3000 resistance. The next major resistance is near the $0.3050 and $0.3060 levels.</p>
      <p>On the downside, an initial support is near the $0.2900 area. However, the main support is near the $0.2880 level. If there is a daily close below $0.2880, the price could accelerate lower towards the $0.2850 and $0.2840 levels in the near term.</p>
