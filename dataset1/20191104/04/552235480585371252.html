      <h1>Scots councils under pressure to end use of cancer causing weedkiller in public places</h1>
      <h2>Glyphosate is a legal ingredient, banned in other countries, which is used as sprays all over Scotland.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T04:30:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Philip, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/andy-philip/</a></address>
      <p>Councils are under pressure to cut the widespread use of a toxic chemical, which has been <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/cancer">linked to cancer</a> , in parks and on verges.</p>
      <p>It comes after a Record investigation found just two of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Scotland’s 32 local authorities</a> have specific written policies to reduce the use of pesticide and herbicide on public land.</p>
      <p>Other councils insisted they are making efforts to look at alternatives or limit applications.</p>
      <p>Community groups have sprung up all over Scotland in an effort to stop councils drenching verges, paths and grass with chemicals and allow wild areas to flourish.</p>

      <p>Most councils confirmed they use glyphosate, which is at the centre of multimillion-dollar cancer lawsuit in California.</p>
      <p>Glyphosate, a legal ingredient used in Roundup, was banned in Austria in June. The Netherlands banned over-the-counter sales for home use.</p>
      <p>In 2015, the World Health Organisation said the chemical probably causes cancer.</p>
      <p>But a range of global chemical and food safety agencies concluded it is not carcinogenic when used as directed – and the EU approved its use in 2017 for five more years after a split vote.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Greens yesterday raised concerns over children’s exposure to chemicals in public places.</p>
      <p>Mark Ruskell MSP said: “These are places where our children should be free to play and come into contact with nature, without the worry of what chemical residues may be on the grass.</p>
      <p>“We’re facing unprecedented loss of biodiversity in Scotland. Our parks and green spaces should be treated as havens for wildlife, not sprayed with broad-spectrum chemicals like glyphosate which kill off everything in their path.”</p>
      <p>The Record asked all councils what chemicals they use and whether there are plans to move away from poisons.</p>
      <p>Glasgow council is moving to “natural” weed killer and claimed to have cut use by half since 2004.</p>
      <p>The city has trialled hot foam, steam, hot water and gas-powered burning.</p>
      <p>In summer, the council began testing to “natural based” products.</p>
      <p>South Lanarkshire said they used herbicide twice a year on all grass edges, obstacles, hard landscaping and borders.</p>
      <p>Aberdeenshire council said they are exploring other methods including more street sweeping and steam treatments.</p>
      <p>Inverclyde and North Lanarkshire are reviewing the use of Glyphosate, while Perth and Kinross said they’d consider “any reasonable alternatives”.</p>
      <p>Edinburgh city council said “limits” were agreed in 2017, using the “least harmful” products.</p>
      <p>Dundee council said it is reducing use of weedkiller, adding: “Examples of this are naturalised areas of grass, wildflower meadow planting and reduction of herbicide controls in shrub and planted areas.”</p>
