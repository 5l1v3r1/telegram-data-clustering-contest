Pro-dem district councillor’s ear stitched back on after bloody fight outside Hong Kong mall

A pro-democracy district councillor who had part of his ear bitten off during a brawl outside a mall last night has had a successful operation to have his ear stitched back on.
According to NOW TV News, pro-democracy lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting told reporters that “Andrew Chiu’s ear has been attached back, and the hospital is observing his condition. He will remain in hospital, needs more rest, and won’t be accepting any visitors for the time being.”
Chiu was taken to hospital following a brutal fight outside a shopping mall in Tai Koo Shing, one of a number of places that saw flash protests over the weekend.
Chiu was trying to prevent a man in a gray T-shirt from leaving the scene after he allegedly attacked several people with a knife outside the Cityplaza mall.
RTHK news, which filmed the brawl, reported that the attacker was a Mandarin speaker — the predominant language on the mainland — and had been arguing with his victims about politics before he pulled out a knife.
Videos of the brawl, which some readers may find upsetting, show the man biting off a bit of Chiu’s ear when he tried to tackle him after the assault.



Another video filmed by localist news outlet Passion Times shows someone handing Chiu a ziplock back with part of the severed ear inside.



At least five people were injured in the incident, including Chiu, and three were arrested. It’s not clear from local media reports if the man who bit off Chiu’s ear has been formally charged yet.
The Hospital Authority confirmed this morning that a total of 17 people were taken to hospital yesterday, including two people in critical condition, following clashes across the city in Tai Koo, Sha Tin, and Tuen Mun.
Police confirmed to Coconuts HK over email that the man they arrested for biting off part of Chiu’s ear was arrested and charged with wounding.
