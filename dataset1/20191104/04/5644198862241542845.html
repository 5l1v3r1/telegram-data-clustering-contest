      <p>Bayern Munich have parted company with coach Niko Kovac, a day after a 5-1 defeat by Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: German champions Bayern Munich have parted company with coach Niko Kovac, a day after a 5-1 thrashing away to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga.</p>
      <p>A statement from the club said Kovac had gone after "mutual agreement" between him and the club.</p>

      <p>Bayern president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said: "The performance of our team in recent weeks and the results have shown us that there was need for action.</p>
      <p>"I had an open and serious conversation with Niko on this basis on Sunday with the consensual result that Niko is no longer coach of Bayern."</p>
      <p>Defeat by Eintracht was Bayern's second of the season but they have also drawn three and are in fourth place in the league standings.</p>
      <p>"We all regret this development. I would like to thank Niko Kovac on behalf of FC Bayern for his work, especially for winning the doubles this past season," added Rummenigge.</p>
      <p>Assistant coach Hans Flick will take charge of Bayern's Champions League clash with Olympiakos on Wednesday and for next Saturday's key clash with Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>Kovac, who took over at Bayern in 2018 after a spell in charge of Eintracht Frankfurt, said it was the "right decision".</p>
      <p>"The results, and also the way we last played, made me come to that decision," he said.</p>
      <p>"During this time, our team has won the championship, the DFB Cup and the Supercup. It was a good time. I wish the club and the team all the best."</p>
