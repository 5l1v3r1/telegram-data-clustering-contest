An ex-government adviser accused of groping four female colleagues on a Christmas night out has been issued with a warning.
Professor Alistair Leanord was with fellow workers from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde when the incidents took place in December 2017.
The women complained to Queen ­Elizabeth ­University Hospital that Leanord, 56, had groped them at Glasgow nightclub.
An anonymous complaint was also made to the General Medical Council.
The GMC investigated the ­allegations against Leanord, who was a medical adviser to the ­Scottish Government until the end of last year.
Leanord, who is now a director of the Scottish Microbiology Reference Laboratories at Glasgow’s Royal Infirmary, claimed he couldn’t remember what happened that night.
But he accepted the women had “perceived his ­behaviour” to be ­inappropriate or ­unacceptable.
The GMC issued him with a warning.
It said his conduct had brought the profession into disrepute but that he faced no further action.
