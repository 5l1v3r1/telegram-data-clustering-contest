國台辦再提對台26條「與中國民眾同等待遇」，陸委會批夾帶「一國兩制」
04 Nov 2019, 04:47 by 李修慧


我們想讓你知道的是中國國台辦繼去年2月發布「惠台31條措施後」，今天又發布26條措施，內容包括台灣人可以在中國駐外使領館申請旅行證件、擴大招收台灣學生等。



中國國務院台灣事務辦公室（國台辦）與國家發改委今（4）日推出對台「26條措施」，針對台灣企業、台灣民眾各13條，內容包括台商可以在中國發展5G建設、台灣人可以在中國使館申請旅行證件、擴大招收台灣學生等，標榜「提供與中國民眾同等待遇」。陸委會則批評，這26條措施「名為惠台、實則利中」本質，是「一國兩制」的政治操作，也凸顯中國想要介入台灣選舉。
繼去年31條措施後，國台辦再提出「26條措施」
（中央社）國台辦與國家發改委今天聯名推出「關於進一步促進兩岸經濟文化交流合作的若干措施」，內含26條，其中針對台灣企業、台灣民眾各13條，標榜「提供與中國民眾同等待遇」。
這項措施被中國國台辦稱為「26條措施」，將自今天起實施，國台辦除透過《新華社》發出通稿及全文，國台辦還在官網特闢專欄逐條解讀，並指這是貫徹中共19屆四中全會之舉。
根據內容，這26條措施包括台資企業可同等參與中國重大技術裝備、5G、循環經濟（資源回收）、民航、主題公園、新型金融組織等投資建設，同等享受融資、貿易救濟、出口信用保險、進出口便利、標準制訂等政策，支持兩岸青年就業創業基地示範點建設等共13條。
其餘13條則是涉及為台灣民眾提供同等待遇，包括在領事保護、農業合作、交通出行、通訊資費、購房資格、文化體育、職稱評審、分類招考等方面提供更多便利和支持。
國台辦說，「26條措施」是深入貫徹落實中共總書記習近平1月2日發表的「習五條」及中共19屆四中全會精神，「完善促進兩岸交流合作、深化兩岸融合發展、保障台灣同胞福祉的制度安排和政策措施」。
四中全會是「中國共產黨第19屆中央委員會第四次全體會議」，是中國共產黨的核心會議，在今年10月28日～10月31日舉行。《中央社》報導，10月31日發布四中全會公報中提到，「堅持和完善『一國兩制』制度體系」，完善促進兩岸交流合作、深化兩岸融合發展、保障台灣民眾福祉的制度安排和政策措施，「團結廣大台灣同胞共同反對台獨、促進統一」。
國台辦聲稱，這26條措施「繼續率先同台灣同胞分享大陸發展機遇，為台灣同胞、台灣企業提供更多同等待遇」。其宗旨與先前的「31條措施」一脈相承，是「在對台工作中貫徹以人民為中心的發展思想，對台灣同胞一視同仁，像為大陸百姓服務那樣造福台灣同胞的又一具體體現」。
國台辦又說，「26條措施」將進一步幫助台資企業加快科技創新，降低綜合成本，搶抓發展機遇，實現更好發展；並繼續為台灣同胞在學習、工作、生活等方面打造更好環境，提供更優條件，促進融合發展，保護合法權益。
去年2月28日，國台辦宣布實施《關於促進兩岸經濟文化交流合作的若干措施》，共31條惠台措施，吸引台灣企業、社團、藝文業等領域人才，前往中國發展。陸委會當時就表示，這是「以利益換取台灣的政治認同。」行政院則批評31條措施，「名為惠台，實則利中」，並提出39項措施因應。


中國公布31項惠台措施—國台辦發言人：前所未見；陸委會：以利益換政治認同


中國「31項措施」吸走台灣人才、企業，行政院提「39項措施」因應


陸委會：「一國兩制」的政治操作
《聯合報》報導，針對今日惠台26條，陸委會發布3點聲明：

該等措施是在去年「對台31項措施」基礎上延伸擴大、變換花樣、包裝宣傳，相關內容不改「名為惠台、實則利中」本質，更夾帶進行「一國兩制」的政治操作，這是「習五條」後，北京當局對台政軍施壓、威嚇迫我接受其「一國兩制」主張的「兩面手法」，其「拉打兩手」人盡皆知，也難以拉近兩岸距離。
北京方面在一年多後再度推出所謂「26條措施」，只是掩飾去年「31項措施」執行不彰的事實，也反映中國大陸經濟下行壓力及各部門間協調限制，實施成效言過其實，完全禁不起檢驗；更是反映這段期間以來台灣人民拒絕「一國兩制」、不認同中共統戰分化的結果。中共企圖透過融台促統政策措施、拉攏台灣，意圖分化台灣內部，更證明企圖介入影響台灣選舉。
去年以來政府已持續追蹤評估「31項措施」，及推動「壯大台灣」相關策略、優化台灣整體環境，並關注後續中共作為對台影響，提醒國人兩岸制度差異，及赴陸應注意可能風險。對於今天中共方面推出的相關同等待遇，政府相關單位仍將嚴肅看待，並進一步評估及妥慎應處；呼籲中共官方具體落實對台商等台灣民眾的投資與生活具體保障。

《自由時報》報導，悉國安事務的人士指出，26條措施介入選舉的意圖明顯。另外，美中貿易戰導致中國外資陸續出走，台商也大量回流台灣或轉向東南亞，北京才希望延緩這樣的腳步以減輕衝擊。《聯合報》報導，中國華東師範大學兩岸關係與區域發展研究所副所長包承柯則認為，26條措施顯現，中國的對台政策基本路線仍是堅持和平的方式，包承柯認為，民進黨政府拒絕九二共識、不斷操作仇陸政策，中國方面推出26條措施，是要對台商表示關心。包承柯也表示，中國沒有把台灣選舉當作考量，也不會介入台灣選舉。

The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council has again mentioned 26 ""the same treatment as the Chinese people"". The MAC has approved the ""one country, two systems"" policy.
04 Nov 2019, 04:47 by Li Xiuhui


What we want you to know is that after the ""Taiwan 31 measures were launched"" in February last year, the China Taiwan Affairs Office issued 26 measures, including Taiwanese who can apply for travel documents and expand enrollment at Chinese embassies and consulates abroad. Taiwanese students, etc.



The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council (Taiwan Affairs Office) and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) today (26th) launched a ""26 measures"" against Taiwan, targeting 13 Taiwanese companies and Taiwanese people, including Taiwanese businessmen can develop 5G construction in Taiwan, Taiwanese You can apply for travel documents at the Chinese Embassy, ​​expand the recruitment of Taiwan students, etc., and advertise ""providing the same treatment as the Chinese people."" The MAC has criticized that the nature of the 26 measures ""named Huitai and Shili Lizhong"" is the political operation of ""one country, two systems"" and also highlights China's desire to intervene in Taiwan's elections.
Following the 31 measures last year, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council has proposed ""26 measures"".
(Central News Agency) The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council and the National Development and Reform Commission jointly launched the ""Several Measures for Further Promoting Cross-Strait Economic and Cultural Exchanges and Cooperation"", which contains 26 articles, including 13 articles for Taiwanese companies and Taiwanese people, advertised as ""providing the same treatment as the Chinese people."" "".""
This measure has been called ""26 measures"" by the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council. It will be implemented from today. In addition to issuing the manuscript and full text through the ""Xinhua News Agency"", the Taiwan Affairs Office will also interpret the article in the official website. This refers to the implementation of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee.
According to the content, these 26 measures include Taiwan-funded enterprises that can participate in China's major technical equipment, 5G, circular economy (resource recovery), civil aviation, theme parks, new financial organizations and other investment construction, and enjoy the same financing, trade relief, export credit insurance. The import and export convenience, standard formulation and other policies support the construction of demonstration sites for cross-strait youth employment and entrepreneurship bases.
The remaining 13 articles are related to providing equal treatment for the Taiwanese people, including providing more convenience and support in consular protection, agricultural cooperation, transportation, communication tariffs, housing qualifications, cultural and sports, professional title evaluation, and classified recruitment.
The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council said that the ""26 measures"" are to thoroughly implement the ""Xi Wu"" published by the Chinese Communist Party's General Secretary Xi Jinping on January 2 and the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee. ""Improve cross-strait exchanges and cooperation, deepen cross-strait integration and development, and guarantee Institutional arrangements and policy measures for the well-being of Taiwan compatriots.""
The Fourth Plenary Session is ""the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China"" and is the core meeting of the Communist Party of China. It will be held from October 28 to October 31 this year. ""Central News Agency"" reported that on October 31, the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session mentioned ""to uphold and improve the ""one country, two systems"" system"", improve institutional arrangements and policy measures to promote cross-strait exchanges and cooperation, deepen cross-strait integration and development, and safeguard the well-being of Taiwanese people. ""Unite the vast number of Taiwan compatriots to jointly oppose Taiwan independence and promote reunification.""
The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council claimed that these 26 measures ""continue to take the lead in sharing the development opportunities of the mainland with Taiwan compatriots and providing more equal treatment for Taiwan compatriots and Taiwanese enterprises."" Its purpose is in line with the previous ""31 measures"". It is ""a concrete manifestation of the implementation of the people-centered development thinking in the work of Taiwan, the equal treatment of Taiwan compatriots, and the benefit of the Taiwan compatriots as a service for the mainland people.""
The Taiwan Affairs Office also said that the ""26 measures"" will further help Taiwan-funded enterprises to accelerate technological innovation, reduce overall costs, seize development opportunities and achieve better development; and continue to build more for Taiwan compatriots in learning, work and life. Good environment, provide better conditions, promote integration and protect legitimate rights and interests.
On February 28 last year, the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office announced the implementation of the ""Several Measures on Promoting Cross-Strait Economic and Cultural Exchanges and Cooperation"". A total of 31 measures to benefit Taiwan, attracting talents from Taiwanese enterprises, associations, arts and literature, and other fields to China. The MAC said at the time that this was ""in exchange for the political identity of Taiwan."" The Executive Yuan criticized 31 measures, ""named Huitai, but in fact benefited"" and proposed 39 measures.


China Announces 31 Measures for Huitai - Spokesperson of the Taiwan Affairs Office: Never seen before; MAC: Exchange of interests for political identity


China’s “31 measures” sucked away Taiwan’s talents and enterprises, and the Executive Yuan’s “39 measures”


MAC: Political Operation of ""One Country, Two Systems""
The United Daily News reported that for the 26th Huitai today, the MAC issued a three-point statement:

These measures were extended, expanded, and packaged on the basis of the ""31 measures against Taiwan"" last year. The relevant content did not change the essence of ""named Huitai, but in fact, benefiting China"", and it also entrusted the political operation of ""one country, two systems"". This is the ""two-faced approach"" that the Beijing authorities have exerted pressure on the Taiwan political forces to threaten me to accept the ""one country, two systems"" proposition. The ""pull and two hands"" are well known and it is difficult to narrow the distance between the two sides.
After more than a year, Beijing has re-launched the so-called ""26 measures"". It only hides the fact that the ""31 measures"" were not implemented in the past year. It also reflects the downward pressure on the Chinese mainland and the coordination restrictions between various departments. The implementation results are overstated and can not be completely forbidden. This is a reflection of the Taiwanese people’s refusal to ""one country, two systems"" and the disagreement with the CCP’s united front. The CCP’s attempt to promote Taiwan’s policy and measures and to win over Taiwan is intended to divide Taiwan’s interior and prove its attempt to intervene in Taiwan’s elections.
Since last year, the Government has continuously tracked and evaluated the ""31 measures"" and promoted the strategy of ""strengthening Taiwan"", optimizing the overall environment of Taiwan, and paying attention to the follow-up influence of the CCP as a platform, reminding the differences between the two sides of the Taiwanese system, and paying attention to possible risks. Regarding the relevant equal treatment introduced by the Chinese Communist Party today, the relevant government units will still take it seriously and further evaluate and take appropriate care of it; they appeal to the CCP official to specifically implement the specific protection for investment and life of Taiwanese people such as Taiwanese businessmen.

The Free Times reported that people familiar with Guoan’s affairs pointed out that the intention of 26 measures to intervene in the election was obvious. In addition, the US-China trade war has led to the continuous departure of Chinese foreign capital, and Taiwanese businessmen have returned to Taiwan or turned to Southeast Asia. Beijing hopes to delay such efforts to mitigate the impact. The United Daily News reported that Bao Chengke, deputy director of the Institute of Cross-Strait Relations and Regional Development of China East China Normal University, believes that 26 measures have emerged. The basic line of China’s Taiwan policy is still a way of insisting on peace. Bao Chengke believes that the people The party government refused the 1992 consensus and continued to operate the hateland policy. The Chinese side introduced 26 measures to express concern for Taiwanese businessmen. Bao Chengke also said that China did not take the Taiwan election as a consideration and would not intervene in the Taiwan election.
The full text of the 26 measures are as follows
