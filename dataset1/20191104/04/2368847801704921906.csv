林鄭赴京內幕流出 商界為其準備「後事」

04 Nov 2019, 04:23

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】英媒放風北京有意撤換林鄭月娥之時，傳出林鄭將於6日赴京，與分管港澳事務的中共常委韓正會面。有港媒說，因時間倉促，北京來不及撤換林鄭，此次會面或授意她繼續當傀儡，加大力度打壓港人抗爭。但香港商界已等不及了，正在為她準備「後事」，尋找特首接班人。
香港電台3日引述特首辦公室表示，林鄭月娥5日將出席在上海舉辦的第2屆中國國際進口博覽會開幕式。上海的活動結束後，當晚會轉往北京，6日上午將與中共國務院副總理韓正會面，下午則出席粵港澳大灣區建設領導小組第3次全體會議，並於7日返港。
由於林鄭赴京的時間點適逢近期英媒放風，北京有意於明年3月前撤換林鄭之時，香港政界關注二人會面中，林鄭的去留問題。
香港01引述接近北京的消息人士的話說，中央短期內無意換特首，因明年面對立法會選舉等硬仗，已無暇分身另闢選舉選委會和行政長官的新戰線，預料韓正會借會見林鄭，向外闢除短期內撤換特首的傳聞，以打消反送中陣營甚至香港商界逼使林鄭下台的念頭。
報導說，雖然北京有意闢謠，但香港商界已傳出在找尋新的特首替代人選，目前傳出的第一人選是財政司司長陳茂波，有地產商開始「押注」，並私下表明支持陳茂波。連陳茂波上位後的接替人選也在醞釀中，另有建制派不同勢力已悄悄造勢，想要為頂替林鄭人選出力。
香港反送中抗爭持續5個月以來，林鄭被示威者點名下台，但其權勢未見撼動，在此期間林鄭還率隊到北京參加中共「十一」閱兵。但英國《金融時報》10月23日報導說，林鄭很可能於明年3月前被撤換下台。

反送中運動爆發的前一個多月內，林鄭與韓正已經有過2次在深圳祕密見面，包括6月15日林鄭宣布暫緩修訂《逃犯條例》的前一天，以及在七一香港大遊行前，二人在深圳會見。
有台媒披露，身為中共江派常委的韓正，力挺港府修訂「反送中條例」，從而使港府與港民的矛盾迅速惡化。
據中央社報導，反送中運動爆發前，韓正於5月18日在北京接見到訪的香港福建社團聯會109名成員時，刻意安排了媒體記者現場採訪。
韓正對媒體和代表團聲稱，特區政府修訂逃犯條例，符合相關規定，「彰顯法治」，中央「完全支持」。韓正的表態，被認為是推動了港府修訂惡法之舉。
時局分析人士鄭中原分析說，韓正早就被認為是製造香港亂局的幾隻中共黑手之一。中共無視港人抗爭的民意和對警暴的民憤，以一次中央全會統一意志，要進一步加大打壓港人，只會引發更大反彈。
他認為，林鄭「十一」進京參加閱兵式後馬上拋出《禁蒙面法》，這次與韓正公開會晤，或許意味著香港局勢將進一步惡化。

Lin Zheng went to Beijing to come out inside the business community to prepare for the ""afterlife""

04 Nov 2019, 04:23

[New Tang Dynasty Beijing time, November 04, 2019] When the British media released Beijing's intention to remove Lin Zhengyue, it was reported that Lin Zheng would go to Beijing on the 6th to meet with Han Zheng, a member of the Standing Committee of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs. Some Hong Kong media said that due to the rush of time, Beijing could not replace Lin Zheng. The meeting or instructed her to continue to be defamed and intensified efforts to suppress Hong Kong people's struggle. However, the Hong Kong business community has been unable to wait. She is preparing for her ""aftermath"" to find the successor to the chief executive.
Radio Television Hong Kong quoted the Chief Executive's Office on the 3rd as saying that Lin Zhengyue will attend the opening ceremony of the 2nd China International Import Expo held in Shanghai on the 5th. After the event in Shanghai, the evening will be transferred to Beijing. On the morning of the 6th, he will meet with the Vice Premier of the State Council, Han Zheng. In the afternoon, he will attend the 3rd plenary meeting of the Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau Dawan District Construction Leading Group and return to Hong Kong on the 7th.
As Lin Zheng’s time to go to Beijing coincides with the recent release of British media, Beijing intends to withdraw Lin Zhengzhi before March next year. Hong Kong’s political circles are concerned about the two people’s meeting, Lin Zheng’s stay.
Hong Kong 01 quoted a source close to Beijing as saying that the Central Government has no intention of changing its chief executive in the short term. As a result of the hardships such as the Legislative Council election next year, it has no choice but to separate the new front line of the Election Committee and the Chief Executive. It is expected that Han Zheng will take part in the meeting. Zheng, rumors of the removal of the chief executive in the short term, to dispel the idea of reversing the camp and even the Hong Kong business community to force Lin Zheng to step down.
The report said that although Beijing intends to blame, the Hong Kong business community has been looking for new candidates to replace the candidates. The first person to be elected is the Financial Secretary, Chen Maobo. Some real estate developers have begun to ""bet"" and privately indicated their support. Chen Maobo. Even the replacement of Chen Maobo's post is also in the making, and other forces of the establishment system have quietly created momentum, and want to replace Lin Zhengren.
In the five months since the anti-delivery campaign in Hong Kong, Lin Zheng was named by the demonstrators, but his power has not been shaken. During this period, Lin Zheng also led the team to Beijing to participate in the CCP's ""Eleventh"" military parade. However, the British ""Financial Times"" reported on October 23 that Lin Zheng is likely to be replaced before March next year.

In the more than one month after the anti-delivery campaign broke out, Lin Zheng and Han Zheng had already met secretly in Shenzhen twice, including the day before Lin Zheng announced the suspension of the revision of the Fugitive Offenders Regulation on June 15 and the University of Hong Kong. Before the parade, the two met in Shenzhen.
Some media have disclosed that Han Zheng, a member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China, has strengthened the ""reversal of the anti-delivery regulations"" by the Hong Kong Government, which has caused the conflict between the Hong Kong Government and the Hong Kong people to deteriorate rapidly.
According to the Central News Agency, before the anti-delivery campaign broke out, Han Zheng deliberately arranged a live interview with media reporters when he met 109 members of the visiting Fujian Association of Societies in Beijing on May 18.
Han Zheng told the media and the delegation that the SAR Government's amendment of the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance is in line with relevant regulations, ""expressing the rule of law"" and the central government ""fully supports"". Han Zheng’s statement is believed to have prompted the Hong Kong government to revise the evil law.
Zheng Zhongyuan, an analyst at the time, analyzed that Han Zheng had long been considered one of the few CCP black hands who created the chaos in Hong Kong. The CCP ignores the public opinion of the people of Hong Kong and the public anger against the police. With a unified will of the Central Plenary Meeting, it is necessary to further increase the suppression of the Hong Kong people, which will only lead to a greater rebound.
He believes that Lin Zheng’s ""Eleventh"" will immediately throw out the ""Forbidden Mask Method"" after entering the military parade. This meeting with Han Zheng may mean that the situation in Hong Kong will further deteriorate.
