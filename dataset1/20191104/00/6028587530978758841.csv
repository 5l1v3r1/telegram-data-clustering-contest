Topline: Under Armour shares dropped 15% in premarket trading after the sportswear company confirmed on Sunday it is under criminal investigation by the Justice Department and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations of improper accounting practices.

A report of the investigation first emerged in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday, which claimed the firm was being investigated to see whether it had shifted sales and expenses between quarters in a bid to bolster earnings.
In response, Under Armour confirmed in a statement on Sunday that it is “cooperating with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice investigations,” and that it it began to respond to “requests for documents and information relating primarily to its accounting practices and related disclosures” from July 2017.
The company defended itself, adding that it believed its “accounting practices and disclosures were appropriate.”

Key background: Under Armour has faced a tumultuous past few years. Last month its CEO and founder, Kevin Plank, stepped down after more than 20 years at the helm and handed the baton to Patrik Frisk, who will take over in 2020. Following a golden era of impressive sales and revenue growth, the firm has in recent years struggled to compete with rivals such as Nike in the U.S. In April 2017, the firm posted a loss and has struggled to regain its previous success, while its share price has fallen 44% in three years.
But financial troubles aren’t the only ones eating away at the firm—facing accusations of being a “boys club,” Under Armour hired a new chief people and culture officer in a bid to improve gender balance in senior roles. It also said it would “do better” last year after it emerged that senior executives, including Plank, would often visit strip clubs or behave inappropriately towards female employees.
What to watch for: Under Armour will report its third-quarter earnings on Monday. According to guidance issued in its previous earnings report, the firm expects its North America sales to continue to fall slightly.
