Why Did Seagate’s HDD Revenue Drop 25% Despite A 1.5x Growth In Exabytes Shipped?

Seagate (NASDAQ: STX) has seen steady growth in the number of hard drive exabytes sold over the past 5 years, rising from 228 exabytes in 2015 to 347 exabytes in 2019, a growth of over 50%. (1 exabyte = 1 million terabytes) Over the same period, Seagate’s hard disk drive revenue has dropped from $12.87 billion to $9.62 billion, a drop of around 25%.
You can view our interactive dashboard- Why Is Seagate’s HDD Revenue Under Pressure Despite A 1.5x Growth In Exabytes Shipped?– to find out more about what drove the inverse correlation between exabytes shipped and revenues.

Why did this happen?


Seagate has seen a drop in HDD units sold, dropping from 211.8 million in 2015 to only 128.3 million in 2019.
This is largely due to a drop in retail demand, with people preferring cloud storage and streaming services over physical memory devices.
Also, the average selling price per TB has dropped from $56.45 to $27.72, as memory devices sold now have 3-4 times the amount of storage space, as compared to devices back in 2015.
This has led to a drop in cost per bit, slashing the price per TB by more than half.

What does this mean?


Retail consumers are gradually moving toward streaming and cloud services, and this is bound to negatively affect Seagate’s hard drive revenue going forward as well.
The number of exabytes sold might still consistently go up, as people’s data storage needs keep growing with time, and a 500GB hard drive that was the standard in 2015, has been replaced by 1TB and 2TB hard drives.
However, this is not a clear indicator of growth, as the number of HDD units sold is consistently dropping, and devices with higher base storage space are also driving down the cost per bit.
With these factors in mind, Trefis doesn’t see a direct correlation between exabytes shipped and HDD revenues anytime soon.
