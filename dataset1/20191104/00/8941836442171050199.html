      <p>BOSTON (AP) - Brad Marchand scored his second goal of the game with 1:57 left in the third period, and the Boston Bruins beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 6-4 Monday night after blowing a three-goal lead.</p>
      <p>David Pastrnak, Jake DeBrusk and Torey Krug also scored for Boston (11-1-2), which has won six straight. Marchand added three assists, extending his point streak to 13 games.</p>
      <p>Dominik Kahun, Nick Bjugstad, Bryan Rust and John Marino scored for Pittsburgh. Marino’s was his first career NHL goal.</p>
      <p>Marchand skated in down the left wing and fired a wrister that hit the far post and went into the net off the back of goalie Tristan Jerry. Krug’s one-timer from the right circle had tied it 4-4 midway into the third.</p>
      <p>Patrice Bergeron added an empty-net goal and Jaroslav Halak made 40 saves.</p>

      <p>Players on Pittsburgh’s bench were jumping up and down when Marino scored to cap the huge comeback and a frustrated Halak smashed his stick off the crossbar into a couple of pieces, tossing the handle off the backboards when he was done.</p>
      <p>SENATORS 6, RANGERS 2</p>
      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored twice and Anders Nilsson stopped 32 shots as Ottawa routed New York for its first road win of the season.</p>
      <p>Tyler Ennis, Ron Hainsey, Brady Tkachuk and former Ranger Vladislav Namestnikov also scored for the Senators, who have four victories in 13 games. Ottawa also snapped the Rangers’ two-game winning streak.</p>

        <p>PREDATORS 6, RED WINGS 1</p>
        <p>DETROIT (AP) - Nick Bonino scored the first of Nashville’s five second-period goals, and the Predators easily dispatched Detroit.</p>
