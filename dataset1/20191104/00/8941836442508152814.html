      <h1>Review: Is this the end for Juan Cabrillo and his team?</h1>

      <p>“Final Option,” Putnam, by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clive-cussler/">Clive Cussler</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boyd-morrison/">Boyd Morrison</a></p>
      <p>Readers of this ongoing “Oregon Files” series will recognize the standard opening of a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clive-cussler/">Clive Cussler</a> novel, but it quickly takes a huge turn and becomes an all-out nonstop action thriller.</p>
      <p>It seems like a typical assignment to rescue three American spies in Brazil, but Juan Cabrillo and the crew of the Oregon have cruised into a deadly trap. A ghost has been resurrected, and now he’s after Cabrillo. He knows about all about the Oregon and commands a vessel that is virtually identical. He has a team with similar talents, and the only thing in the way of this ghost’s plan for domination is Cabrillo being alive. That soon will change.</p>
      <p>Once Cabrillo learns about the existence of a man he thought was dead and the weapons at his fingertips, he knows the ensuing cat-and-mouse game will be the most difficult battle he’s ever encountered. Especially since his enemy always seems to be one step ahead of him.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boyd-morrison/">Boyd Morrison</a> has taken this <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clive-cussler/">Clive Cussler</a> series to new heights, and “Final Option” is the best one yet. The story hits the gas pedal and never taps the brakes. Having an enemy that is essentially a mirror image of the hero adds extra suspense and mayhem. The characters truly seem in jeopardy, and nothing will ever be the same. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clive-cussler/">Cussler</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boyd-morrison/">Morrison</a> have written another guaranteed bestseller.</p>
