Building a champion not only means the ability to recruit, but to deal with adversity on and off the court (such as the cycle of graduation, injuries, and casualties due to academics), and to coach. Yes, having an all-star lineup doesn’t guarantee success. It helps, but as the saying goes, “the ball is round.”
Let’s take a look at how Thomas Anthony “Tab” Baldwin has done in his four years with the Ateneo Blue Eagles by the numbers and charts.



Before Tab Baldwin (Third Place)Year 1—UAAP Second PlaceYear 2—UAAP champion, Champions League championYear 3—Filoil Preseason Cup champion, BBI champion, City Hoops champion, UAAP championYear 4—D-League champion
Let’s take a look at the improvement of his teams over the years.



And lastly, how they rank on both offense and defense.



The question at this point is, “Will they win it all again?” They are in the finals, but they still have to win two more games.
