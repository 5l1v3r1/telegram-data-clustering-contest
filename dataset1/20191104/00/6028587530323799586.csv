Walmart’s Black Friday 2019 Shipping Policy

Despite official shipping policy news from Best Buy and from Target, Walmart has kept silent. But this silence is telling. Target has long had the best Black Friday shipping terms and it was keen to promote this. Similarly, Best Buy’s announcement was an upgrade to match Target. But, speaking to industry insiders, the bad news is Walmart’s silence is because the store will stick to the same $35 minimum spend for free shipping as in previous years. 
The good news? It looks like you’ll want to spend a lot more than $35 on Walmart’s 2019 Black Friday sales.

Walmart Black Friday 2019: Expected Sales

While Walmart’s current sales are solid, they are also just a tease for the main event and you can expect headliners like the iPhone 11 Series, Galaxy S10 and Note 10, Xbox One X and PS4 Pro to all join in. Walmart is also under pressure after a leaked ad scan revealed Costco’s jaw-dropping Samsung savings this year. 
Consequently, these are doorbuster deals you should look out for during Walmart’s Black Friday 2019: 

Apple iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max - $300 Walmart Gift Card when activating a new instalment plan (rivals will likely limit to $250)
Samsung Galaxy S10, S10+, Note 10 - $300 Walmart Gift Card when activating a new instalment plan (may just be $400 as Best Buy will have direct savings and Costco will offer a $420 gift card) 
Microsoft Xbox One X Bundle with $40 Walmart Gift Card - $369.99 (save $140)
Sony PlayStation 4 Pro Bundle - $269.99 (save $130)
Nintendo Switch Bundle (game or free memory card) - $240 (save circa $110)
Apple Watch Series 5 (GPS + Cell) - $749.00 (save $50) - this will only match B&H’s current live deal
Apple Watch Series 4 (GPS + Cellular) - $429 (save $100) - matching Walmart’s current live deal 
Apple AirPods with Wireless Charging Case (Latest Model) - $159.99 (save $40) - edging out Amazon’s current live deal
65-inch 4K TV - $350 from a respectable brand (for more premium deals checkout Samsung’s blow-out live TV deals)
55-inch 4K TV - $200 from a respectable brand



Walmart Black Friday iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max sales will be doorbustersApple


Samsung Black Friday 2019: Here Are The First DealsForbes Gordon Kelly

Interestingly, many of Walmart’s biggest Black Friday deals have alternative sales which are actually live now. Walmart will deliver larger savings on Black Friday itself but stock will be low - particularly its headlining iPhone 11 series $300 deal. I also can’t see Walmart beating many of the current Samsung TV sales. 
That said, Walmart will deliver close to best-of-class deals on all major smartphones, games consoles and both premium and budget TV options - which should see it standout during Black Friday 2019. That is Walmart’s strength: it has everything.
