Kentucky officials announce lane closures for bridge repairs

04 Nov 2019

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) - Kentucky transportation officials say lane closures are planned on an Ohio River Bridge that connects Louisville to southern Indiana so that expansion joint repairs can be made.
The Kentucky Transportation Department says in a statement that lane closures on the Interstate 65 Kennedy Bridge will begin this week. The statement says the right three lanes of Interstate 65 South will close at midnight on Nov. 8 and reopen at 5 a.m. on Nov. 27.
Officials say motorists should watch for work zone signs and slower traffic.
The left three lanes of I-65 will be closed in December as part of the same project.

The work is being done to provide a smoother ride for vehicles traveling over the span.
