      <p><b>Topline</b>: McDonald’s announced Monday that Global Chief People Officer David Fairhurst has left the fast food giant following the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/isabeltogoh/2019/11/04/mcdonalds-ceo-steve-easterbrook-fired-over-consensual-relationship-with-employee/#788c70b33eec">departure </a>of CEO Steve Easterbrook, who was fired over the weekend for having a consensual relationship with an employee.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fairhurst’s departure was announced in an internal memo signed by new CEO Chris Kempczinksi, who replaced Easterbrook after his ouster, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-04/mcdonald-s-chief-people-officer-david-fairhurst-leaves">reported</a>.</li>
        <li>Fairhurst was named as global chief people officer in 2015, shortly after Easterbook took over as CEO. </li>
        <li>Mason Smoot, a senior vice president who also served as Easterbrook’s chief of staff, will take his place on an interim basis, Bloomberg reported.</li>
        <li>McDonald’s declined to comment further, citing company policy not to comment publicly on personnel matters. It is unclear what Fairhurst’s role was in the scandal or why he is leaving.</li>
        <li>McDonald’s shares were down more than 3% Monday. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>News peg</b>: Over the weekend McDonald’s board of directors ousted Easterbrook, who is divorced, for having a consensual relationship with an employee, which violates company policy prohibiting relationships by managers with direct or indirect subordinates.</p>
      <p>While romantic relationships between managers and employees relationships are not illegal, many companies have no-dating policies to avoid allegations of preferential treatment or lawsuits arising from unwanted advances or sexual harassment.</p>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: Easterbrook is credited with overhauling McDonald’s by renovating restaurants, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andriacheng/2019/06/20/mcdonalds-first-major-acquisition-in-years-could-be-a-game-changer/#773d39dd361d">acquiring </a>an Israeli artificial intelligence startup and introducing eco-friendly policies. But the company has been the target of activists seeking a $15 minimum wage across the country, and McDonald’s HR department has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/business/mcdonalds-female-employees-sexual-harassment.html">accused </a>of failing to prevent sexual harassment at its restaurants. In response, the company, under Easterbrook, started a complaint hotline for front-line employees and revamped training. </p>
      <p><b>Tangent</b>: Easterbrook, who took home nearly $16 million in executive pay last year, will get six months severance pay, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcdonalds-to-pay-easterbrook-26-weeks-severance-11572881843">reported</a>.</p>
