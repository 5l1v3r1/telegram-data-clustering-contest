Tesla’s latest software update brings support for traffic cones to AutoPilot
04 Nov 2019, 00:25 by Surur
One of the great virtues of Tesla cars is that they are constantly improving via regular software updates. The last update, for example, improved the power and range of the cars and brought an automatic navigation feature. The latest update brings a useful new AutoPilot features to Tesla cars – the ability to see and respond to traffic cones while in AutoPilot mode.



The changelog reads:
“The driving visualization now displays traffic cones. In cases where a traffic cone is detected and Navigate on Autopilot is engaged (requires Full Self Driving Capability), the vehicle is designed to suggest a lane change (or attempt a lane if REQUIRE LANE CHANGE CONFIRMATION is set to NO) to avoid cones. As always, you are responsible for your vehicle and are required to pay attention at all times.”
It’s notable that the feature requires the Full Self-Driving package, which is an add-on many Tesla cars do not have.
Tesla owners report that at present not all cones appear to be recognized by Tesla Autopilot (though this will improve over time), making the warning that drivers should always remain aware and in control of their car at all times even more important.
