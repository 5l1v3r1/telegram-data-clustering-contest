      <p>PHOENIX (AP) - Devin Booker scored 40 points, Ricky Rubio added 21 points and 10 assists, and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/phoenix-suns/">Phoenix Suns</a> beat the NBA’s final undefeated team by knocking off the Philadelphia 76ers 114-109 on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Phoenix (5-2) is three games over .500 for the first time in more than four years. The surprising <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/phoenix-suns/">Suns</a> are on a three-game winning streak and off to their best seven-game start since 2013.</p>
      <p>Booker, serenaded with MVP chants from the home crowd in the fourth quarter, has 6,003 points in his career. He’s the eighth-youngest player in NBA history to reach 6,000. The fifth-year guard, who turned 23 last week, finished 15 of 19 from the field, including 3 of 4 from 3-point range, and 7 of 7 on free throws.</p>
      <p>Phoenix pushed ahead 100-93 midway through the final quarter, but the lead quickly disappeared and Al Horford tied the game when he came flying down the lane for a one-handed, putback slam.</p>
      <p>From that point, it was back and forth until the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/phoenix-suns/">Suns</a> went up in the final few minutes when Booker and Kelly Oubre Jr. made big buckets to put them in front for good.</p>

      <p>Playing without suspended star Joel Embiid, the Sixers (5-1) were led by Horford’s 32 points. Horford tied a career high with five 3-pointers and shot 13 of 20 from the field. Tobias Harris added 24 points and Furkan Korkmaz had 20.</p>
      <p>Horford nailed a 27-foot 3 at the buzzer to put the 76ers ahead 61-55 at halftime. The 13-year veteran shot 6 of 7 from the field in the first half, including 3 of 4 from 3-point range.</p>
      <p>Embiid served the second game of his two-game suspension for an altercation with Minnesota’s Karl Anthony-Towns last week. The 7-foot center is eligible to return when the 76ers travel to face the Jazz on Wednesday.</p>
