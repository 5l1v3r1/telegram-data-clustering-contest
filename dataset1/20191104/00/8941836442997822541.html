      <p>LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) - The Latest on President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>’s rally on the eve of the Kentucky governor’s race (all times local):</p>
      <p>7:40 p.m.</p>
      <p>Kentucky <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/matt-bevin/">Gov. Matt Bevin</a> has received a ringing endorsement from President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> at an election eve appearance together, hours before voters choose between <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/matt-bevin/">Bevin</a> and Democrat <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andy-beshear/">Andy Beshear</a>.</p>
      <p>At the campaign rally Monday evening in Lexington, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> called <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/matt-bevin/">Bevin</a> a “terrific” governor and said Kentucky is thriving like never before. He says Kentucky voters can send a signal to the rest of the country by re-electing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/matt-bevin/">Bevin</a> on Tuesday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/matt-bevin/">Bevin</a>’s popularity had slumped after he tried to overhaul the state’s public pension systems, which drew protests from teachers and others.</p>
