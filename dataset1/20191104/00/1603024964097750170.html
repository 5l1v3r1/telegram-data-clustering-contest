      <p>The Congress on November 4 said it is gearing up to launch a mass protest for restoration of statehood to Jammu and Kashmir. The party also accused the BJP-led government of "turning a blind eye" to the concerns of residents of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
      <p>On August 5, the Centre had announced the decision to bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir into two Union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh -- which came into existence on October 31.</p>
      <p>The bifurcation means that the Centre will be in direct control of law and order and police in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir through the Lieutenant Governor.</p>

      <p>District Congress Committee (DCC), Jammu (Urban), president Vikram Malhotra alleged that the state of Jammu and Kashmir has been reduced to an "administration unit" and its glory has been snatched.</p>
      <p>"The party is gearing up to launch a mass protest to force the central government to restore the statehood of the Dogra state of Jammu and Kashmir," Malhotra said.</p>
      <p>He was addressing a meeting of DCC office bearers, corporators, block and ward presidents at the Jammu and Kashmir Congress headquarters here.</p>
      <p>Criticising the BJP, the Congress leader said even after the formal transition of Jammu and Kashmir to a Union territory, the issues of domicile safeguard and job safety and security remained unaddressed.</p>
      <p>"The future of lakhs of unemployed youth is in jeopardy. The present dispensation is turning a blind eye to the apprehensions and concerns of people, especially those of the Jammu region," Malhotra said.</p>
      <p>He urged the party workers to unite and protest against the government's "anti-people" decisions and to become the voice of the people of Jammu.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
