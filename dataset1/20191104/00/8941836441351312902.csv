A jury has convicted an Oklahoma City police officer of second-degree murder in the shooting death of a man who was threatening to set himself on fire.
The jury on Monday found Sgt. Keith Sweeney guilty in the Nov. 15, 2017, death of 29-year-old Dustin Pigeon. Second-degree murder is punishable by 10 years to life in prison. The jury recommended a 10-year prison sentence. A judge will formally pass sentence at a date still to be set.
