      <h1>Jets hit rock bottom with 1-7 start as Gase’s seat heats up</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T00:00:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">DENNIS WASZAK Jr.</a></address>
      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - It took just eight games for a season that began with high hopes to hit rock bottom for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">New York Jets</a>.</p>
      <p>Coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-gase/">Adam Gase</a> is on the hot seat. Quarterback <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sam-darnold/">Sam Darnold</a> is regressing. The seemingly always-frustrated fan base is seething.</p>
      <p>And the struggling <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> are still only halfway through the season.</p>
      <p>“One-and-seven is not fun to go through,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-gase/">Gase</a> said Monday. “Things haven’t gone the way that we wanted to. It’s just that’s what happens in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> sometimes and, unfortunately, we’re going through it right now.”</p>
      <p>An embarrassing 26-18 loss to previously winless <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> on Sunday was the brutal capper to an enormously disappointing first half of the season.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-gase/">Gase</a> is the most popular target of criticism by fans and media, with some calling for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> chairman and CEO Christopher Johnson to end his tenure now - just 10 months after he was hired. One ambitious group has even started a GoFundMe page to help raise money for billboards and plane banners calling for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-gase/">Gase</a>’s firing.</p>
      <p>“It’s just something that I don’t really focus on,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-gase/">Gase</a> insisted.</p>
      <p>Between game planning issues, clock management missteps, a slew of injuries to key players and a tough opening schedule, it has all added up to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> matching their second-worst start in franchise history. They’ve been 1-7 five other times, most recently in 2014. Only the 1996 squad under Rich Kotite was worse at 0-8 before finishing 1-15.</p>
      <p>But after losing to the lowly Dolphins, there’s no clear sign that things will get turned around anytime soon.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>“All I can focus on is, we’ll be better for having to go through this,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-gase/">Gase</a> said. “We’ve got to figure out a way to dig ourselves out of this and go find a way to win a game.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sam-darnold/">Darnold</a>’s overall performance during the last three games has been particularly troubling.</p>
        <p>The second-year quarterback has three touchdown passes and eight interceptions in the losses to New England, Jacksonville and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a>. He has also completed just 58.4% of his passes (59 of 101), but it’s more than just the numbers.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sam-darnold/">Darnold</a>, working behind a porous offensive line, has been pressured early and often, and been forced to make throws off his back foot or at times even flat-footed. He’s pressing, trying desperately to make a play and falling into bad habits as a result.</p>
        <p>“There’s definitely some things that I can clean up,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sam-darnold/">Darnold</a> said. “I think just from that aspect, personally, I think I can play a little bit faster, go through reads a little bit faster. And then as a team, I just think we need to keep improving.”</p>
        <p>That will be the key in the second half of the season, especially for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sam-darnold/">Darnold</a>. He’s considered a franchise-type quarterback, and he’ll be expected to show signs of playing like one down the stretch.</p>
        <p>“It sucks to say, now that we’re 1-7, but we’re right there,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sam-darnold/">Darnold</a> said of his team. “We’ve just got to clean up some things and we’ll be OK.”</p>
        <p>WHAT’S WORKING</p>
        <p>Everyone’s card keys to get into the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a>‘ facility.</p>
        <p>Despite being visibly frustrated after the game Sunday, Johnson hasn’t taken any drastic measures - yet.</p>
        <p>“When we lose a game, I feel like I let him down and having not gotten us to where I was hoping we’d be at this point,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-gase/">Gase</a> said. “He understands that he’s going to get everything I have day in and day out to try to work things out of where we are at right now.”</p>
        <p>WHAT NEEDS HELP</p>
        <p>It sounds like a broken record, but the reality is the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> need to improve everywhere - from the coach to the quarterback and everywhere in between.</p>
        <p>The offensive line has been especially brutal, and it was called for five penalties at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> and allowed nine quarterback hits. A botched snap from center Jonotthan Harrison to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sam-darnold/">Darnold</a> that went out of the end zone for a safety was the exclamation point on a bad day.</p>
        <p>STOCK UP</p>
        <p>Jamison Crowder. He re-emerged as a favorite target of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sam-darnold/">Darnold</a> with eight catches for 83 yards and his first touchdown with the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a>. It was Crowder’s best all-around game since the season opener, when he caught 14 passes for 99 yards.</p>
        <p>STOCK DOWN</p>
        <p>Jamal Adams. A tough performance capped a rough week for the star safety. Adams had four tackles and a sack along with a handful of lapses in coverage. That came after Adams said last week he was “hurt” by being mentioned in trade talks. He has turned down requests from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-gase/">Gase</a> and GM Joe Douglas to speak with him to clear the air.</p>
        <p>INJURED</p>
        <p>Running back Le’Veon <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bell/">Bell</a> had an MRI on one of his knees, and the team was awaiting results. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-gase/">Gase</a> learned of the potential injury Monday morning when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bell/">Bell</a> missed team meetings to undergo the tests. … Linebacker C.J. Mosley (groin) remains sidelined. … Nose tackle Steve McLendon is being evaluated for a neck injury. … The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> could get both left tackle Kelvin Beachum (ankle) and tight end Chris Herndon (hamstring) back this week.</p>
        <p>KEY NUMBER</p>
        <p>25 - The number of touches <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bell/">Bell</a> got a week after he told <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-gase/">Gase</a> he was frustrated with just 11 at Jacksonville. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bell/">Bell</a> gained 66 yards on the ground on 17 carries, along with 55 yards receiving on eight catches. If healthy, he’ll likely be just as involved - if not more - moving forward.</p>
        <p>NEXT STEPS</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a>, as the home team, face the Giants on Sunday for MetLife Stadium bragging rights. A victory would give <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-gase/">Gase</a>’s group a positive step to build on with a four-game stretch of potentially winnable matchups - Washington, Oakland, Cincinnati and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> again - up next.</p>
