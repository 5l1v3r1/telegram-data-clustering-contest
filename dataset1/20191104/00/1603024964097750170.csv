The Congress on November 4 said it is gearing up to launch a mass protest for restoration of statehood to Jammu and Kashmir. The party also accused the BJP-led government of ""turning a blind eye"" to the concerns of residents of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir.
On August 5, the Centre had announced the decision to bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir into two Union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh -- which came into existence on October 31.
The bifurcation means that the Centre will be in direct control of law and order and police in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir through the Lieutenant Governor.
