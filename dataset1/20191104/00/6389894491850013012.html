      <p>Commuter towns in the South East are popular areas for wealthy workers because of strong transport links with London and proximity to main airports such as Heathrow. </p>
      <p>In the top spot was Esher, a town in Surrey dubbed Britain’s Beverly Hills, where residents pay 28 per cent of their average £68,600 earnings in income tax, the research said. </p>
      <p>The area is home to high-profile celebrities such as Elton John, Gary Lineker and Andy Murray, as well as wealthy City workers.</p>
      <p>Neela Chauhan, Tax Partner at UHY Hacker Young says: “The South East has cemented its position as one of the most affluent areas in the UK. </p>
      <p>“This is likely to continue for years to come as Stockbroker Belt towns attract high earning celebrities and City workers alike.</p>

      <p>“However, the government needs to be careful not to kill this golden goose by overtaxing it. </p>
      <p>“We have seen signs in some areas, such as non-doms, that higher levels of tax is gradually driving high earners out of the country.”</p>
