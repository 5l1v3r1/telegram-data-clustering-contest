        <p>Court documents say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/richard-holzer/">Richard Holzer</a> was arrested Friday in Pueblo just after the agents brought him what were supposedly two pipe bombs along with dynamite to blow up Temple Emanuel.</p>
        <p>The agents said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/richard-holzer/">Holzer</a> described the explosives as “absolutely gorgeous” and said they should go ahead with the attack overnight to avoid police.</p>
        <p>The investigation into <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/richard-holzer/">Holzer</a> began after an undercover FBI agent purporting to be a woman who supports white supremacy contacted him on Facebook.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/richard-holzer/">Holzer</a> is due to make his first court appearance Monday.</p>
        <p>It’s not clear if he has a lawyer representing him.</p>
