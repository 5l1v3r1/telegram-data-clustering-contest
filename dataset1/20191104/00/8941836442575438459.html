      <p>LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) - Chelsea’s appeal against a transfer ban by FIFA for breaking rules to sign youth players from abroad will be heard on Nov. 20 at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>
      <p>CAS has announced the hearing date on Monday, with a verdict due before the midseason transfer window opens in January.</p>
      <p>Chelsea already served half of its one-year ban on registering new players during the offseason trading period.</p>
      <p>The club did not seek to freeze the FIFA sanction while preparing the appeal to CAS.</p>
      <p>FIFA’s disciplinary and appeal committees have said Chelsea violated 150 rules protecting minors from trafficking. Those cases involved about 70 players.</p>

      <p>Chelsea was also judged to break rules prohibiting third-party influence on players. FIFA imposed a fine of 600,000 Swiss francs ($608,000).</p>
      <p>The club has denied wrongdoing.</p>
