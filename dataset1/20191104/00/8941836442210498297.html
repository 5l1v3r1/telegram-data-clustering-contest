      <p>BEIJING (AP) - Chinese President Xi Jinping promised more gradual market-opening steps at the start of an import fair Tuesday but no major initiatives to ease complaints about technology policy and other irritants that sparked a tariff war with Washington.</p>
      <p>Xi spoke at the opening of the second annual China International Import Expo, which is meant to mollify <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/beijing/">Beijing</a>’s trading partners by showcasing its vast and growing import market. The organizer says it includes more than 3,000 companies from 150 countries and regions.</p>
      <p>“The door that China is opening will only open further and wider,” Xi said in a speech to an audience that included French President Emmanuel Macron and prime ministers from Greece, Jamaica and Serbia.</p>
      <p>Xi affirmed promises to reduce restrictions on foreign investment and an offer, first made in June, to accelerate work on a China-Europe investment treaty.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/beijing/">Beijing</a> has eased foreign access to its consumers, but none of the changes address U.S., European and other complaints about Chinese technology policies and other irritants that triggered the trade war.</p>

        <p>Business groups have welcomed greater access to Chinese consumers but express frustration that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/beijing/">Beijing</a> is easing access to industries one at a time instead of throwing open its economy.</p>
