      <p>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — The Oklahoma Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a ban on a second-trimester abortion procedure.</p>
      <p>The high court acted Monday after an Oklahoma abortion clinic appealed a lower court judge’s decision to uphold a ban on a second-trimester abortion procedure.</p>
      <p>The Tulsa Women’s Reproductive Clinic requested the temporary injunction to put the law on hold, telling justices that the law would be detrimental for women.</p>
      <p>The 2015 law would restrict the use of instruments in dilation and evacuation abortions after 14 weeks of pregnancy, except when needed to save the woman’s life or prevent a serious risk to her health. It had been on hold while the legal challenge was pending.</p>

        <p>State numbers show nearly 7% of about 5,000 abortions performed in Oklahoma in 2018 were performed using this method.</p>
