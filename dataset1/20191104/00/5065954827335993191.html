      <p>Bianca Pagdanganan floundered at the finish but her closing 78 still netted her a berth in next year’s LPGA Tour as she wound up tied at 38th after eight rounds of the LPGA Q-Series at Pinehurst No. 9 in North Carolina on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Safely within the Top 45 plus ties cut at joint 18th heading to the final day of the gruelling elims, Pagdanganan fell off the standings with a 38 start and found herself in danger of missing it altogether when she cracked under pressure and dropped four strokes in a three-hole stretch from No. 15 of Pinehurst No. 9.</p>
      <p>But the country’s spearhead in the SEA Games closed out with a gutsy par for a 78, barely gaining the coveted card with a 576 total for joint 38th with five others finishing tied at 41st at 577.</p>
      <p>Pagdanganan thus became the latest Filipina to join the LPGA Tour although former card holder Dottie Ardina fell short of her bid with a 579 total after a closing 74 for 48th.</p>
      <p>Clariss Guce also skied to a 77 and wound up tied at 56th. Ardina and Guce settled for Symetra Tour spots.</p>
      <p>China’s Muni He capped her run of under-par rounds throughout the Q-Series with a 710 and took the low medalist honors with a 551, three strokes ahead of Korean Hee Young Park, who pooled a 554 after a 70 with American Yealimi Noh snatching third place with a 557 after a 69.</p>
      <p>A bogey-free, eagle-spiked 64 in the pivotal sixth round put Pagdanganan, the Asian Games bronze medalist, in the mix and a scrambling 72 virtually assured her of an LPGA card Friday.</p>
      <p>But a double-bogey on No. 3 and a bogey on the sixth in the final round somehow hinted at the coming off a challenging day for the Gonzaga U product, who double bogeyed the par-5 15th and bogeyed the next two holes.</p>
      <p>It was, however, a sorry finish for Ardina, who bogeyed two of the first six holes, recovered the strokes with birdies on Nos. 9 and 10 but dropped out of the cutoff line with another double-bogey on No. 11 and a bogey on No. 13.</p>
      <p>She birdied the par-3 17th but ran out of holes in her comeback bid.</p>
