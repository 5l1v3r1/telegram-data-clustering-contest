KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 4): RHB Retail Research said Bahvest Resources Bhd may rebound higher after it continued holding above the 50 sen support.
In a trading stocks note today, the research house said last Friday’s white candle sent the stock to its 6-week high, thereby enhancing the bullish sentiment.
“A positive bias may emerge above the 54 sen level, with an exit set below the 50 sen threshold.
“Towards the upside, the immediate resistance is at the 57.5 sen mark. This is followed by the 60.5 sen level,” it said.
