      <p>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) - Missouri’s top tourism official is out of a job, days after a complaint accused him of excessive taxpayer-funded travel and improper acceptance of gifts from a state vendor.</p>
      <p>The Missouri Division of Tourism announced Director Ward Franz’s departure Friday but didn’t say if he was fired or resigned.</p>
      <p>An Oct. 25 letter from an investigator in Democratic state Auditor Nicole Galloway’s office outlined allegations from a whistleblower complaint. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch obtained the letter through an open-records request.</p>
      <p>The whistleblower alleged that in addition to travel expense concerns, Franz accepted baseball tickets “valued at over $1,000” for games at Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park.</p>
      <p>Franz does not have a listed phone number. He formerly served as chief of staff to Republican Gov. Mike Parson when Parson was lieutenant governor.</p>
