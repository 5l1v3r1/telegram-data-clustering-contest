      <h3>Time Out Says</h3>
      <p>Chicken wings served in an ox-drawn cart? Topped with peanut M&amp;Ms? And a soundtrack of pumping Indi-pop? Hitchki had us at Namaste.<br/><br/>A funky, lively <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurant-awards-2019/397977-dubais-best-indian-restaurants-2019">Indian</a> restaurant and bar – and a relatively new one to Barsha Heights – Hitchki is playful, modern and absolutely not your grandmother’s local.<br/><br/>Vibrant interiors of teal, purple and orange are matched by the eclectic menu, which opens with a “back in time” section designed to recall favourite dishes from diners’ childhoods, such as Maggi noodles with egg or chicken, and Emirates Pofaki cheese curl-topped roti with omelette.<br/><br/>There’s a vast amount of <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/gallery/410668-50-best-dishes-in-dubai-of-2019">dishes</a> to choose from, all reasonably priced, with dedicated sections for “baos, momos and all”, rolls, flatbreads, potatoes in myriad guises and even chicken.<br/><br/>From the latter “Angry Birds” section it’s the bhut jolokia wings and rings that arrives on that aforementioned ox-drawn cart. Coated in a sweet, but fiery barbecue sauce, these wings are as good as any – and don’t knock the chocolate-coated peanut garnish until you’ve paired it.<br/><br/>Tandoori paneer in an achari marinade is superb – fragrant and creamy with a moreish char. Of the flatbreads, served either Turkish pide-, Levantine manakish- or Catalan coca-style, the bakra qiston pe pide is “Hitchki Recommended”.<br/><br/>The menu might describe these as canoe-shaped, but prepare for something of more QE2-esque proportions, crammed with pulled lamb, fried onions and sprinkled with creamy goat’s cheese.<br/><br/>For the less adventurous, the “butterly” dal makhani is just that – a 12-hour simmered bowl of creamy, salty lentils drizzled with ghee, served with crisp aloo tikki and piping hot mini kulcha.<br/><br/>With fun vibes and <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants">food</a>, great service and prices, Hitchki may literally translate as “hiccups”, but you’re unlikely to find any in the experience.<br/><br/><b>WHAT IS IT...</b><br/>Seriously quirky Indian-fusion dishes and lively vibes in Barsha Heights<br/><br/><b>WHY GO...</b><br/>For chicken wings topped with M&amp;Ms. Of course.</p>
