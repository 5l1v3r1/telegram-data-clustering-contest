      <h1>Bernie Sanders: ‘My ideas are not far left’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T00:00:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/jessica-chasmar/" target="_blank">Jessica Chasmar</a></address>
      <p>2020 presidential candidate and self-admitted Democratic socialist <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/">Bernard Sanders</a> said Saturday he rejects the notion that his proposals are “far left.”</p>
      <p>“My ideas are not far left, they are the ideas that the American people want,” the Vermont senator told a crowd at the Iowa NAACP’s Economic Freedom town hall, <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/11/02/bernie-sanders-ideas-not-far-left/">according</a> to a video taken at the event.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/">Mr. Sanders</a>, who is polling at about 17% nationally, has proposed far-reaching policies that most moderates would consider extreme, including guaranteed housing, tuition-free college and free health care for illegal immigrants.</p>

        <p>It’s not the first time the senator has denied being a fat-left candidate. In September, he <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a29265852/bernie-sanders-not-far-left-presidential-candidate/">told</a> Cosmopolitan, “You know, the media will sometimes describe me as ‘far left,’ but honestly, I don’t accept that moniker. Because if you look at the issues that I talk about, they are supported by the American people. I have led the effort in this country with some success to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Is that a radical idea? I don’t think so. Overwhelming support for that among the American people.”</p>
