The tragic deaths of 39 people found in the back of a lorry in Essex should be “wake up call for the Government” to rethink its approach to illegal migration, MPs warn today.
The Commons Foreign Affairs Committee warned a policy focused on closing borders will drive migrants to take more dangerous routes and push them into smugglers’ hands.
The human cost of so-called “irregular” migration made international partnerships, including with the EU, “essential”, the committee says.
Committee chair Tom Tugendhat said: “The case of 39 people found dead in a lorry in Essex shocked us all.
“The full story won’t be clear for some time but this tragedy is not alone.
“Today, hundreds of families across the world are losing loved ones who felt driven to take the fatal gamble to entrust their lives to smugglers.
“This case should serve as a wake-up call to the Foreign Office and to Government.”
The driver of the lorry, Maurice Robinson, from Northern Ireland, appeared in court last week charged with a string of offences, including 39 counts of manslaughter.

Extradition proceedings have also begun against 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison, who was arrested in Dublin on a European Arrest Warrant.
Police are also seeking two brothers from Northern Ireland, Ronan and Christopher Hughes, who are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and people trafficking.
The case has renewed calls for safe routes for migrants seeking better lives in Britain.
Today’s report, ‘Responding to irregular migration: a diplomatic route’, also raised concerns about deals to limit migration with countries such as Libya, Niger and Sudan as risking fuelling human rights abuses.
Mr Tugendhat added: “The UK has been relatively isolated from the different migrant crises in recent years - but it’s wrong to assume that we are protected from their impact.
“The UK has a proud history of helping those fleeing conflict and persecution and cooperating with others to protect human rights.
“We should lead by example.”
