What Are Americans’ Biggest Financial Regrets?
04 Nov 2019 by John F. Wasik
It’s slam dunk subject that most Americans don’t want to talk about: Not having enough money. It’s a perennial bugaboo.According to a recent survey from TD Ameritrade, “while politics and religion are topics regularly debated, money conversations seem to be stigmatized or off-limits, and that needs to change.”
What bugs people the most?

A third of Americans feel that it’s not polite to discuss finances in social settings, and the fear of being perceived as a failure is the number one reason Millennials don’t openly discuss the topic.
Student loan debt is the most uncomfortable financial topic to discuss (36%), followed by childcare expenses (30%) and living paycheck to paycheck (26%). “While many Americans feel comfortable discussing key financial elements with their spouse/partner/significant other, only 45% feel comfortable discussing student loan debt with them.”
Half of Americans (51%) and seven in 10 Millennials (71%) think that society would be healthier if people felt they could discuss personal finances more freely.
Baby Boomers are twice as likely as Millennials to not share their financial mistakes with others (25% vs. 12%).

Financial woes can be addressed. After all, it’s just money. It merits a discussion and there’s plenty of help available.
First of all, debts can be managed and paid off, particularly student debts. There are several repayment plans available. See what’s available and what could work for you. The federal student loan program has plenty of options.
Saving is made easier by hundreds of phone apps and online sites. You can save every time you spend money or set up automatic savings plans at work through your 401(k) plan.
Use three buckets for savings: 1) Short-term (month to month bills), 2) Mid-term (home downpayment, education, emergencies) and 3) Retirement.
Still flummoxed? I’d recommend writing down all of your spending and see how you can save money – and make it automatic. Then figure out how much you can put away and how much it will grow over time.
Here’s a simple calculator to get you started.
