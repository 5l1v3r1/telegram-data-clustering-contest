      <p>The BBC is calling for businesses to help fund local journalism and “hold those in power to account”.</p>
      <p>Around 150 democracy reporters were previously recruited in partnership with the New Media Association (NDA) and local news outlets.</p>
      <p>The BBC is hoping to expand the roster of reporters and the level of local institutional scrutiny, and is arguing for outside funding.</p>

      <p>Director-general Lord Tony Hall has called on business to help back local journalism as the partnership between the corporation and other media expands.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s never been more important to invest in local journalism.</p>
      <p>“The 150 reporters we’ve funded through the Local News Partnerships have made a real difference to local communities, giving people the information they need to hold those in power to account.</p>
      <p>“Now it’s time to go further. I want businesses and other institutions to join with us so we can get even more reporters into local communities – and give people the local journalism they deserve.”</p>
      <p>Under an expanded scheme, a cohort of new reporters would be recruited, greater scrutiny would be given to frontline services and institutions, and an outside body would oversee the programme.</p>
      <p>It is hoped that the eternal body will be able to seek alternative sources of funding beyond the public broadcaster.</p>
      <p>The extent of expansion and recruitment would depend on the funding secured.</p>
      <p>NMA chief executive David Newell said: “The Local News Partnership has produced clear benefits for local journalism, and it is right for us to now look at how it could be expanded.</p>
      <p>“The NMA and local news sector look forward to working closely with the BBC as these plans for expansion progress, building on the successes of the partnership to date.”</p>
      <p>Reporters have so far produced around 100,000 reports for the new scheme, which allows news to be shared between the BBC and local media.</p>
      <p>The journalists are funded by the BBC as part of its latest Charter commitment, but employed by regional news organisations.</p>
