        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a>, of democratic socialist self-identifying fame, said to a crowd in Iowa over the weekend that he’s not “far left,” that his ideas are not “far left,” and that he’s really only giving the people what they want.</p>
      <p>He said it with a straight face.</p>
      <p>And you thought miracles couldn’t happen.</p>
      <p>“My ideas are not far left,” he <a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/bernie_sanders_ideas_not_far_left">said</a>, in a video clip released by the Des Moines Register. “They are the ideas the American people want.”</p>
      <p>Choke. Cough. Gasp.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>The context of his remark isn’t exactly clear; the clip doesn’t flush in either direction. But there’s not really any context that could account for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/">Sanders</a> making such a statement.</p>
      <p>Look at his policies and platforms.</p>
      <p>“Our campaign is calling for a 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights that guarantees all of our people the right to the basic necessities of life — and guarantees those rights regardless of Americans’ income, race, religion, gender, country of origin or sexual orientation,” BernieSanders.com <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/">states</a>.</p>
      <p>That alone is a breath-taking deviation from the principles that make America great — free-market freedoms, rugged individualism, small government. And the idea that rights come from God — meaning, of course, government, in all its burdensome social justice, take-from-the-rich, give-to-the-Democrat-Party-voter glory, can just stay home.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>The left loves to dub everything a “right” as a way of justifying government intrusion into areas government just doesn’t belong — all as a means of exerting controls and affixing regulations and seizing powers into areas government just shouldn’t be.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/">Sanders</a>‘ other ideas?</p>
        <p>“Justice and Safety for All.”</p>
        <p>“Eliminating Medical Debt.”</p>
        <p>“Tax on Extreme Wealth.”</p>
        <p>“Racial Justice.”</p>
        <p>What a heaven on earth he promises.</p>
        <p>It’s all a lie. It’s all deception.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/">Sanders</a> can no more blot out racism from the hearts of racists than he can blot out medical debt. Or guarantee safety and justice for all.</p>
        <p>The very least he could do is be honest about his political leanings.</p>
        <p>Framers intended the government to remain in check; founders believed in the concept of individual rights.</p>
        <p>There’s nothing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/">Sanders</a> stands for that abides that basic principle. Everything he breathes is Big Government, progressive, socialist policy, economic redistribution and high tax-dollar giveaways — in short, far-left ideas.</p>
