      <h1>Diablo 4’s Release Date? The Director Says It’s Not Even Coming ‘Blizzard Soon’</h1>

      <p>Blizzard spent most of BlizzCon hyping up two big releases, <i>Overwatch 2</i> and <i>Diablo 4</i>, though we ended the weekend without either getting actual release dates. <i>Overwatch 2</i> seems like it might be a <i>little</i> closer to release than <i>Diablo 4</i>, which apparently is still years (and years) away.Blizzard <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/03/blizzard-explains-diablo-4s-loot-system-and-it-sounds-really-good/#7037d0d528eb">showed off a lot</a> from <i>Diablo 4</i>, so much so that it seemed like a release could in fact be somewhat close, at least within the next year or so. We got a nine minute cinematic, a three minute gameplay trailer, about 75 minutes of panels covering pretty much every aspect of the game, D4 was playable at the show and featured in a massive Game Informer cover story. That’s…a substantial amount of previewing.</p>
      <p>And yet when pressed about when <i>Diablo 4</i> is actually coming out, game director Luis Barriga minced no words:</p>
      <p>“A game of this scope takes time. We’re not coming out soon, not even Blizzard soon.” Barriga says the current, playable build is the “first early step in the journey.”</p>
      <p>“Blizzard soon” is a common community meme where Blizzard often uses “soon” to describe things and that can mean anywhere from a few weeks to years, but it’s usually <i>somewhat</i> close. But Barriga is making it clear that <i>Diablo 4</i> is genuinely far away.</p>

      <p>It seems a little odd to me, given how much was shown and even playable, but I remember hearing about how developers often bend over backwards making builds to show off at events even when the final product is not anywhere near coming together. See the <i>Anthem</i> debut that was pretty much crafted <i>entirely</i> for an E3 preview and was totally changed when the game was actually released. I do wonder if Blizzard just worked hard on <i>just</i> a BlizzCon build to reassure people D4 existed and was coming, but the final product may be wildly different than what was featured at the show.</p>
      <p>Strangely, <i>Diablo 4</i> is being described as being made for PC, Xbox One and PS4, though next generation consoles arrive in exactly a year, no doubt long before <i>Diablo 4</i> is going to come out. Maybe they’re just assuming the game will be backward compatible on the new consoles, but I found it odd to cite consoles that will be very much last-gen by the time D4 gets here.</p>
      <p>Additionally, while I know that “a game of this scope takes time,” it <i>has</i> been seven years already since <i>Diablo 3</i> came out, and in that time, Blizzard has released <i>Overwatch</i>, <i>WoW</i> and <i>Hearthstone</i> expansions, and not a whole lot else. We know they were working on a <i>StarCraft</i> FPS that got cancelled but still, a decade between <i>Diablo</i> games seems a bit much in this day and age, even though yes, there were <i>twelve</i> years between <i>Diablo 2</i> and <i>3</i>. Though it’s not like these games are in development that entire time, it’s a matter of what’s being prioritized.</p>
      <p>The point is, I would not expect <i>Diablo 4</i> to arrive any time before late 2021, but probably even 2022 or beyond. That does seem a bit crazy considering just how much we saw from it, and how most AAA games are now not showing off much until the year of their release these days, but it seems <i>Diablo 4</i> just wanted to assure people of its existence and overall goals, but make it clear we are settling in for a long wait, despite what’s been shown. An odd choice perhaps, but that’s where we are.</p>
