Andy Murray and wife Kim are celebrating the birth of their third child - and have revealed to close friends that it's a boy.
The tennis ace and his long-term partner are already parents to girls Sophia, three and Edie, two.
And last week they added a boy to their growing brood, although they have only just broken the gender news to their friends.
The Sun has claimed that the baby - whose name is yet to be decided - is understood to have been born at a hospital in London.

Andy’s grandfather Roy Erskine, 88, told the publication: “It’s a wee boy.
“He was born during the week, I don’t know what his name is yet. My wife is away down, she went down this morning.”
Meanwhile, Murray recently joked after winning the European Open that he needed to get back to touring as his family is getting 'out of control'.
""I’ve got two young kids and a third one coming. I’ll have three kids under four years old,"" he said.

“When I’ve been off the tour the last few years my family has got bigger.
“I need to get on the road so we’re done before it gets out of control!
“I’m excited for the third kid. My wife has been a huge support in getting me back on the court.
""She’s helped me fight to keep playing.”
