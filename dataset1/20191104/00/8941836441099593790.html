      <p>LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) - A soccer official found guilty of self-dealing hundreds of thousands of dollars in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fifa/">FIFA</a> funds will try to overturn his 10-year ban from soccer this month.</p>
      <p>The Court of Arbitration for Sport says it will hear Chabur Goc Alei’s appeal against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fifa/">FIFA</a> on Nov. 18.</p>
      <p>As president of South Sudan’s soccer federation, Alei profited from his own business changing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fifa/">FIFA</a> dollars into local currency at a below-market rate, gave a construction project contract to a firm he co-owned with his brother, and diverted money intended for women’s and youth soccer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fifa/">FIFA</a>’s ethics committee judged Alei oversaw six-figure money transfers with no authorization or explanation.</p>
      <p>Alei’s actions were revealed by a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fifa/">FIFA</a>-ordered audit in 2016 of how the South Sudanese soccer body used almost $1.2 million sent from Zurich in the previous two years.</p>

      <p>In its published verdict, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fifa/">FIFA</a> panel said “Alei’s degree of guilt must be regarded as very serious,” and noted his “absence of remorse or confession.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fifa/">FIFA</a> ethics judges also fined him 500,000 Swiss francs ($507,000) and ordered him to pay for the ethics investigation.</p>
      <p>Alei had been appointed to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fifa/">FIFA</a>’s fair play and social responsibility committee after South Sudan gained <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fifa/">FIFA</a> membership in 2012.</p>
