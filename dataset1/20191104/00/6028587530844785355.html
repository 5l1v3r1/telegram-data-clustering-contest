      <p>Apple’s common sense approach (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/11/02/google-pixel-4-pixel-4-xl-review-should-you-upgrade/">unlike some rivals</a>) to upgrading the iPhone 11 (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/09/14/apple-iphone-11-vs-iphone-xr-iphone-11-pro-max-whats-the-difference-new-iphone-upgrade/">guide</a>) has resulted in a class-leading phone at a bargain price. But this looks set to change. </p>

      </p>
      <p>In a new report seen by <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/03/apples-brawny-5g-iphone-family-will-require-larger-pricey-motherboards">AppleInsider</a>, acclaimed Apple tipster Ming-Chi Kuo has revealed that Apple’s desire to equip <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/07/28/apple-iphone-5g-2020-upgrade-iphone-xs-max-xr-update/">every 2020 iPhone with 5G</a> will result in some dramatic price rises. </p>
      <p>“Kuo believes that the main logic-board on the 2020 iPhone 5G will have to grow by about 10% in area to accommodate the new technologies,” explains AppleInsider. “That increase in area will come with a cost - the [mother]board fabrication and some new antenna technology will force a 35% increase in cost to build that component.” </p>
      <p>Kuo reveals that the motherboard is one of the most expensive components in an iPhone, with only the OLED display and A-series processor costing more. As AppleInsider points out: “At present, 5G options in shipping phones are adding about an additional $400 to the price of an already expensive flagship phone, like the Galaxy S10.”</p>
      <p>While Apple has a scale of economy like no-other, the company also has profit margins like no-other meaning the decision to equip every new iPhone with 5G is going to be hard. I suspect Apple will be able to bring down the current $400 premium (despite using Qualcomm 5G modems like its rivals), but it seems inevitable that iPhone fans will have to shoulder several hundred dollars being added to their next phones. </p>

      </p>
      <p>And this is a tough pill to swallow because leaks reveal Apple’s 2020 iPhone plans are some of the most ambitious in iPhone history. Perhaps most head-turning is the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/10/17/apple-iphone-2020-touch-id-iphone-11-pro-max-update-iphone-xs-max-xr-upgrade/">return of Touch ID</a>, but there will also be <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/09/07/apple-iphone-12-design-5g-touch-id-upgrade-iphone-xs-max-xr/">new screen sizes</a>, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/07/21/apple-iphone-release-2020-display-upgrade-iphone-xs-max-xr-update/">stunning 120Hz ProMotion displays</a>, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/07/30/apple-iphone-2020-3d-camera-usbc-upgrade-iphone-xs-max-xr-update/">long-range 3D cameras</a> and the long-awaited <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/07/30/apple-iphone-2020-3d-camera-usbc-upgrade-iphone-xs-max-xr-update/">switch to USB-C</a>. Of course, the problem with all this mouthwatering tech is it won’t come cheap either. </p>
      <p>Apple is famous for increasing iPhone prices while still retaining massive sales, but its 2020 iPhones may just push customers to the limit. </p>
