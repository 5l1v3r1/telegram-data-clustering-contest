      <h1>Belichick at loss of words after Patriots’ 1st loss</h1>

      <p>BALTIMORE (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">New England Patriots</a> coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bill-belichick/">Bill Belichick</a> can be prickly and standoffish, even after a dominating victory.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bill-belichick/">Belichick</a> showed a different side Sunday night after the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> lost for the first time in 11 months, 37-20 to the Baltimore Ravens.</p>
      <p>After watching his defense get shredded by Ravens dual threat Lamar Jackson and unable to will quarterback <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Tom Brady</a> into another amazing comeback, the usually unflappable <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bill-belichick/">Belichick</a> was uncharacteristically soft-spoken, barely registering above a whisper as he tried to explain what happened.</p>
      <p>“We competed out there, but it just wasn’t good enough,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bill-belichick/">Belichick</a> said. “There is really not much to say tonight.”</p>
      <p>Virtually every question posed to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bill-belichick/">Belichick</a> during his five-minute postgame availability was met with some variation on that theme.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bill-belichick/">Belichick</a> acknowledged that Jackson’s speed posed problems for a defense that couldn’t keep up with him. He agreed that the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> committed too many self-inflicted mistakes to overcome. A coach who always seems supremely confident of his team and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Brady</a> looked shell-shocked and seemed at a loss for words.</p>
      <p>“We all have to do a better job, starting with me,” he sighed.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> (8-1) came in allowing only 7.6 points per game and with a plus-17 turnover differential. None of that seemed to matter to the Ravens, who scored on each of their first three possessions to take a 17-0 lead.</p>
      <p>An offside penalty on the initial drive enabled the Ravens to get out of field goal formation and go for a touchdown, which Jackson scored on a frolic around left end.</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> forced two turnovers, made two themselves and never got closer than four points after putting themselves in that early hole. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a>‘ first giveaway, a fumble by Julian Edelman, was taken 70 yards the opposite way for a Baltimore touchdown.</p>
        <p>“He was just trying to get yards,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Brady</a> said of Edelman. “Give them credit. Those types of plays, good defenses make.”</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a>‘ other turnover, an interception by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Brady</a> in the fourth quarter, was following a 14-play drive that sealed the deal.</p>
        <p>New England hit hard, but simply didn’t play as well as the Ravens.</p>
        <p>“It was a physical game. My neck feels it right now,” Ravens guard Marshal Yanda said. “Give them a lot of credit. They’re very physical, but tonight we made more plays than them.”</p>
        <p>Most of them by Jackson, who ran for two scores and threw for another. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bill-belichick/">Belichick</a> said in the days leading up to the game that he didn’t have anyone on his team who could emulate Jackson’s speed and agility, and on Sunday he saw first-hand just how quick the second-year quarterback can be.</p>
        <p>At least the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> won’t have to face him again - until, perhaps, the playoffs.</p>
        <p>“They are not on the schedule, so we don’t have to worry about them,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bill-belichick/">Belichick</a> said.</p>
        <p>The offense was sound, with the exception of the two turnovers. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Brady</a> went 30 for 46 for 285 yards and a touchdown , and Edelman and Mohamed Sanu each had 10 catches.</p>
        <p>Now comes a bye, and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> will spend some of the time thinking about their first loss of the season and how to improve for the second half.</p>
        <p>“Losses always find a way to recalibrate how you see yourself,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Brady</a> said. “We obviously have a lot of work to do. When you get beat by 17 points, that’s now what we’re about.”</p>
        <p>Said Edelman: “We can go either of two days from here - we can learn from it and get better or go the other way. I have faith we are going to learn from it and get back to where we need to be.”</p>
