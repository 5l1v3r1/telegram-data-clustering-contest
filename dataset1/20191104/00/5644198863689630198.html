      <p>LILLE, France: Thirty-three people were injured on Sunday (Nov 3), at least four seriously, when a Paris-London bus with passengers from nine countries overturned in northern France, local authorities said.</p>
      <p>The Flixbus vehicle toppled onto its side around midday (1100 GMT) as it took an exit from the A1 motorway, France's busiest route, the Somme prefecture said in a statement.</p>

      <p>Of the 33 people on board, 29 sustained light injuries and four were seriously hurt, the statement said, though the fire brigade put the number at five.</p>
      <p>Their lives are not in danger, the prefecture said.</p>
      <p>Eleven were French and 22 were foreign nationals - 10 from Britain, five from the United States, two from Romania, and one each from Spain, Australia, Mauritius, Japan and Sri Lanka.</p>
      <p>They were taken to various area hospitals, while Flixbus set up an emergency number.</p>
      <p>The Munich-based company, which operates low-cost bus services between major European cities, said in a statement that it was in "close contact with local authorities to determine the exact causes of the accident, and to take care of the passengers".</p>
      <p>A fatal accident occurred in southern France on Oct 6 when a Flixbus en route from Barcelona to Bordeaux flipped onto its side after swerving off the road, claiming the life of a 21-year-old Frenchwoman.</p>
      <p>Another 17 people were injured. The driver, a 50-year-old woman, has been charged with involuntary homicide.</p>
