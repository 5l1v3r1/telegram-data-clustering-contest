Nifty is trading in a rising wedge formation where upper ascending trend line is standing around 12,000 marks and break down will be below lower trend line standing around 11,500 levels.
Market was trading in a tight range from last few days and a breakout above 11,700 has confirmed strength in rally. The index has support near 11,500-11,600 and resistance at 11,975 where the upper Bollinger band stands at. Move above this push prices higher towards previous life high at 12,100 and further towards 12,400 levels.

However, since majority of the oscillators are in overbought zone, possibility of prices retracement towards a unfilled gap placed around (11,606-11,583) cannot be ruled out which can extend towards ascending trend line standing around 11,500 marks.
Interestingly, Nifty has seen 84 percent of rollover on Thursday, higher than the last series rollover data (73 percent). We expect continued optimism with trading range of 11,500-12,400 and one can opt for buy on dip strategy.
