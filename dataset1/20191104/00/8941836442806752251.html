      <p>SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) - A southwestern Missouri woman could face up to 30 years in prison after being convicted of killing a man she met on an online dating site.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say 34-year-old Christina Duckett was found guilty of second-degree murder in the death of 40-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joshua-brooks/">Joshua Brooks</a> of Republic. Sentencing will be in January.</p>
      <p>A jury on Friday deliberated five hours before announcing the verdict.</p>
