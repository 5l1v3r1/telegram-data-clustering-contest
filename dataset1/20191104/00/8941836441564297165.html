      <p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Police in Nashville are searching for a man they say paid for a movie ticket and spent the night inside a theater waiting to rob the business once it opened.</p>
      <p>Metro police identified 57-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lloyd-eugene-rhodes/">Lloyd Eugene Rhodes</a> on Friday as the suspect who they say robbed an AMC theater at gunpoint the day before. News outlets report that investigators think <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lloyd-eugene-rhodes/">Rhodes</a> bought a movie ticket Wednesday night and hid inside the theater during closing. When a 23-year-old employee opened the business the next morning, police say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lloyd-eugene-rhodes/">Rhodes</a> pointed a gun at her and demanded cash. He’s also accused of stealing the employee’s cell phone and car.</p>
      <p>Police said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lloyd-eugene-rhodes/">Rhodes</a> has committed similar robberies in other cities, including Memphis.</p>
