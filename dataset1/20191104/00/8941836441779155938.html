      <p>READING, Mass. (AP) - A boil water order imposed in a Boston suburb after a water sample tested positive for E. coli has been lifted.</p>
      <p>The state Department of Environmental Protection said Monday it’s determined that drinking water in Reading, Massachusetts no longer poses a public health threat.</p>
      <p>Officials say residents should flush their water systems to clear any potentially contaminated water.</p>
      <p>They also say any beverages, ice, uncooked foods and baby formula made with tap water collected on or after Oct. 31 should be discarded.</p>
      <p>The town is investigating what caused the contamination. The order was imposed Friday and officials distributed bottled water over the weekend.</p>
