      <h1>Media Matters to fly plane over Facebook office with message criticizi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T00:00:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/ryan-lovelace/" target="_blank">Ryan Lovelace</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a> CEO <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mark-zuckerberg/">Mark Zuckerberg</a>’s leftist opponents are working to make sure there is nowhere he can look without seeing their criticism.</p>
      <p>Media Matters for America, a left-leaning media watchdog, is planning to fly a plane over <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a>’s Menlo Park, California, offices with a banner bearing the message, “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">FACEBOOK</a> 💜 RIGHT WING LIES.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a>’s decision to not fact-check political ads stands in stark contrast to the decision of its competitor Twitter’s <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/30/jack-dorsey-twitter-dropping-political-ads/">decision</a> to pull political ads altogether. Angelo Carusone, Media Matters president, said in a statement that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a>’s ad policy and news partners initiative is “essentially opening the floodgates so its users are left to drown in a sea of misinformation and bigotry.”</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a> is now the single greatest ally and enabler of propagandists, liars, and extremists,” Mr. Carusone said in a statement. “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mark-zuckerberg/">Zuckerberg</a>’s continued reflexive pandering to conservative pundits, right-wing extremists and white nationalists should terrify everyone.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mark-zuckerberg/">Mr. Zuckerberg</a>’s relationships with conservative media members came under congressional scrutiny during his testimony before the House Financial Services Committee last month.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mark-zuckerberg/">Mr. Zuckerberg</a> visited the committee to talk about Libra, his company’s cryptocurrency project, but he was <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/23/ocasio-cortez-questions-zuckerberg-courting-conser/">grilled</a> by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over his ongoing effort to build relationships with political conservatives.</p>
      <p>Since July, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mark-zuckerberg/">Mr. Zuckerberg</a> has met in private with several conservative media personalities, including Fox News’ Tucker Carlson and commentator Ben Shapiro.</p>
      <p>“In your ongoing dinner parties with far-right figures, some of who advance the conspiracy theory that white supremacy is a hoax, did you discuss so-called social media bias against conservatives and do you believe there is a bias?” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez asked.</p>
      <p>“Uh, congresswoman, um, sorry, I don’t remember everything that was in the sentence, in the question that you asked,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mark-zuckerberg/">Mr. Zuckerberg</a> answered.</p>

        <p>Ms. Ocasio-Cortez moved on to other questions, but her allies such as Media Matters still have not let the gripe go.</p>
        <p>On Monday evening, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mark-zuckerberg/">Mr. Zuckerberg</a> <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/nov/4/leading-islamic-critic-facebook-meet-ceo-mark-zuck/">is scheduled</a> to dine with left-leaning Muslim Advocates Executive Director Farhana Khera about what she views as the company’s “anti-Muslim problem.”</p>
