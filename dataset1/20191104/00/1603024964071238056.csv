Raut in the post also greeted his followers with the slogan ""Jai Hind"", even as the party has since long been insisting on using the salutation- ""Jai Maharashtra"".
Amid standoff with ally BJP over formation of the next government in Maharashtra, Raut is scheduled to meet with Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Monday evening.
The meeting is slated to take place a day after Raut claimed his party would soon have its chief minister with the support of ""170 MLAs"".
