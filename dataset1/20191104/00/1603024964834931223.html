      <p>Earlier in the day, the bank's <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/yes-bank-says-offer-worth-3-billion-on-table-4596781.html">chief executive said</a> it has received a binding offer of $1.2 billion from a global investor and in addition received eight bids from global investors worth close to $1.5 billion.</p>
      <p>Yes Bank has been eyeing a capital infusion and did successfully raise $273 million through a Qualified Institutional Placement recently, resulting in equity dilution of 10 percent. However, it is now gearing up for furtherÂ capital infusion that will both help in absorbing the asset quality shock and kickstart growth.</p>
      <p>The capital adequacy ratio of the bank has dipped in the last few quarters due to the accelerated recognition of non-performing assets(NPAs) under chief executive, Ravneet Gill.</p>
      <p>"We have $3 billion of potential money which can come in and will be looking at all the options with an open mind," Gill said.</p>
      <p>He said the bank may opt for either a single investor or multiple investors participating in the fundraiser.</p>
      <p>Its common equity tier-I capital buffer will go up by 2.60 percent over the 8.7 percent in September 2019 if the $1.2 billion funds come in, he added.</p>
      <p>The private lender had reported a <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/yes-bank-q2-result-higher-provisions-lead-to-rs-600-cr-loss-sharp-increase-in-npas-4595681.html">loss of Rs 600.08 crore</a> for the July-September quarter on November 1.</p>
      <p>Net interest income during Q2 declined 9.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,185.91 crore, which including fresh slippages of around Rs 228 crore.</p>
      <p>Shares of Yes Bank on the BSE closed 0.75 percent lower at Rs 66.1.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
