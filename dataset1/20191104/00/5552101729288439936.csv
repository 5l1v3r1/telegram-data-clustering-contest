《後壁間》紀錄片首映　看見「營養5餐」的改變
04 Nov 2019, 00:36 by 葉文全
由灃食文公益飲食文化教育基金會耗時一年拍攝的紀錄片《後壁間》3日舉辦公益首映會，門票收入全數捐贈「台灣全民食物銀行協會-偏鄉教室營養補充包方案」，基金會董事長姚仁祿以及捐助人魏應充也出席觀賞紀錄片。
灃食基金會從2018年開學後，以一年時間將「營養5餐計畫」導入新北市育德國小和青潭國小，紀錄片以濕濕熱熱的校園廚房《後壁間》為起點，紀錄一群企業家、教育者、設計師、廚師的努力，以及家長、老師、校廚等營養午餐關係人的衝突與轉變。
看到基金會這一年的成果，姚仁祿特別感性感謝捐助人魏應充，「如果不是捐助單位的魏應充先生，他的堅定跟無私支持，我想灃食基金會再怎麼努力，也不會走得這麼有自信。」

魏應充首映會後也在「來自永靖的老園丁-魏應充」粉絲團發文表示，「我看到孩子們品嚐道美味的笑容，還能表達對備食者的感恩，讓我看了非常欣慰，更堅定認為，對的事情要繼續做下去！」
魏應充引用聯合國兒童基金會今年公布的世界兒童報告指出，全球7億個5歲以下兒童中，有1/3的兒童營養不良或體重過輕。而台灣有許多在職父母，也無法花費足夠的時間或金錢注重孩子的飲食，因此希望灃食基金會從學校教育紮根，帶動更多人關注學童健康飲食。他進一步指出，飲食教育的目標不僅是教導孩子如何吃得可口、健康，而是如姚仁祿所說，「希望孩子們通過健康飲食，懂得優雅文化」。

The premiere of the ""Back Wall"" documentary saw the change of ""Nutrition 5 Meals""
04 Nov 2019, 00:36 by Ye Wenquan
The documentary ""After the Wall"", which took a year to shoot by the Food and Culture Foundation, was held at the public welfare premiere on the 3rd. All the ticket sales were donated to the ""Taiwan National Food Bank Association - Partial Home Class Nutrition Supplement Package"". Yao Renlu, Chairman of the Foundation, and Wei Yingchong, a donor, also attended the documentary.
After the start of the school in 2018, the Foraging Foundation introduced the ""Nutrition 5 Meal Plan"" to the New Town of Germany and the Qingtan National Primary School in one year. The documentary began with the wet and hot campus kitchen ""The Back Wall"". Record the efforts of a group of entrepreneurs, educators, designers, chefs, and the conflicts and changes in nutrition, lunch, and other relationships between parents, teachers, and school chefs.
Seeing the achievements of the Foundation this year, Yao Renlu was particularly grateful to the donor Wei Yingchong. ""If it is not the donor unit, Mr. Wei Yingchong, his firm and selfless support, I think the Foraging Foundation will work hard and will not go so far. Have confidence.""


At the premiere of the meeting, Yao Renlu, Chairman of the Foraging Foundation, thanked Wei Yingchong for his firm ideals and selfless support in fulfilling the hope of children to learn healthy culture and understand the elegant culture. (Reviewed from ""Old Gardener from Yongjing - Wei Yingchong"" Facebook)

After the premiere of Wei Yingchong, the fan group of ""Old Gardener from Weijing - Wei Yingchong"" issued a message saying, ""I saw the children taste a delicious smile and expressed gratitude to the eater. I was very pleased. I firmly believe that the right thing should continue to do so!""
Wei Yingchong quoted UNICEF's World Children's Report released this year as saying that one-third of the world's 700 million children under the age of five are malnourished or underweight. There are many working parents in Taiwan, and they can't spend enough time or money to pay attention to their children's diet. Therefore, they hope that the Foraging Foundation will take root from school education and drive more people to pay attention to the healthy eating of school children. He further pointed out that the goal of food education is not only to teach children how to eat delicious and healthy, but, as Yao Renlu said, ""I hope children can learn an elegant culture through healthy eating.""
