Between the pages Are you somebody who can’t stop raving about your favourite book or author or an Instagram poem or even a random paragraph you came across? If you just nodded your head and said ‘yes’, bookmark the Facebook page of Atta Galatta. Every month, Rohini Venkatesh Malur invites book nerds to its AG Book Club – to discuss their favourite pieces of literature. Topics form science fiction to fantasy and sadness, everything is discussed. It’s a casual meetup, so there is no set way in which it operates and that’s why sometimes it can go on for hours. At 5th Block, Koramangala, call 9632510126 or follow their Facebook page Vegan’s luck If you are planning to turn vegan, it’s natural for you to have a lot of doubts and queries on how to make the big transition. Don’t worry, you have The Bengaluru Vegans potluck to your rescue. On the last Saturday of every month, members get together at Cubbon Park to chit-chat, learn and yes, enjoy a potluck of vegan treats. Though it’s an informal gathering, make a note of few rules. Bring one or more vegan dishes – prepared or purchased – that can be had by at least five-six people. Carry your own cutlery and water. At Cubbon Park, follow Vegan Bangalore on Facebook The zero mark You want to join the zero-waste movement but not sure how to start? You know, questions such as what the alternative to garbage bin bags is, where you should buy packaging-free dal and atta from, how you should reduce you carbon footprint, how you should recycle cardboard boxes. Zero Waste Bangalore can help you out. They discuss new things at every meetup – from how to sensitise private companies to go plastic-free to how to upcycle used flowers into perfumes, toners, and holi colours. Location varies, call 7353078600 Get set, go Let’s Talk Travel. With a name like that, you know what we are getting into.

Yes, travelling is an exhilarating experience and everyone should wander off once in a while. So come to this meetup and inspire others. At Lahe Lahe, HAL 2nd Stage, Indiranagar, call 9886294444 or follow their Facebook page Small treats Orange chocolate macaron, mint white chocolate macron, caramel macaron, raspberry ganache macaron...
