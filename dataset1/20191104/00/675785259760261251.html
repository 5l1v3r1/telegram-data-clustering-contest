      <p>A woman was stuck at sea for three days after her dinghy was blown off course while returning to her yacht.</p>
      <p>The 45-year-old tourist had taken the rubber boat to the Greek island of Folegandros, where she went shopping.</p>
      <p>The New Zealander was on her way back to her British husband's yacht when she went missing on Friday.</p>
      <p>She was swept across the Aegean Sea and was eventually rescued 50 miles north of Crete yesterday.</p>
      <p>A coastguard patrol boat spotted her vessel and found the woman exhausted and dehydrated, reports say.</p>

      <p>Six navy vessels and a helicopter were involved in the search, according to The Sun.</p>
      <p>It is believed efforts were underway last night to reunite the tourist with her British husband, who was on their yacht when she went missing.</p>
      <p>She rang him just before she set off from Folegandros on her return trip.</p>

      <p>The woman is reportedly an experienced seafarer who has taken part in major sailing competitions.</p>
      <p>It comes weeks after Kay Longstaff plunged into the Adriatic and was rescued after treading water for 10 hours.</p>
      <p>Ms Longstaff said she fell from a cruise ship and sang to keep herself warm in the cold.</p>
      <p>However, investigators think she 'jumped', with passengers on the Norwegian Star claiming Ms Longstaff and her boyfriend had a drunken row before she plunged from the seventh deck.</p>
      <p>Investigators believe she jumped off the ship 'voluntarily' – and in a ‘determined’ fashion.</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old will not have to contribute to the cost of her rescue, thought to run into several hundred thousand pounds.</p>
