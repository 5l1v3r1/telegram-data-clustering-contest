        <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03374-x">Indigenous groups will reap rooibos profits</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The San and Khoi peoples of southern Africa — along with low-income farming communities — are to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03374-x">share in the profits of the lucrative rooibos tea</a> that is farmed on their traditional lands. The South African government’s decision is the first industry-wide agreement under the Nagoya Protocol of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, an international law that sets the rules for compensating communities if their knowledge of biodiversity is used by businesses or scientists. The government’s decision broke a decade-long deadlock in which the tea industry and Indigenous representatives disagreed over whether the San and Khoi people originated the use of rooibos as a beverage. The industry still isn’t convinced, but has agreed to pay.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Twenty-seven countries have pledged US$9.8 billion to replenish a United Nations’ fund for developing nations to adapt to climate change. The pledges <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03330-9">exceed the $9.3 billion promised in 2014</a> — despite the absence of the United States and Australia this time. The United States committed more money than any other nation in 2014, but has since withdrawn $2 billion of the promised $3 billion, and has declined to contribute further.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>As fires raged in the San Francisco Bay area of California, researchers running a trailblazing study of the health effects of smoke sprung into action. The research is one of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03345-2">the first to monitor wildfires’ effects in a diverse group of people over several years</a>. Scientists hope to use the results to create evidence-based guidelines for mitigating risk and work out what interventions — such as air purifiers — can help.</p>

      <p>Forest ecologist Suzanne Simard takes a measured look at <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/77/underworlds/never-underestimate-the-intelligence-of-trees">the extent of plant communication, cognition and emotions</a>. “When you go and whack off the top of a plant … is that an emotional response?” she asks. “It’s certainly trying to save itself. It upregulates. Its genes respond. It starts producing these chemicals. How is that different than us all of a sudden producing a whole bunch of norepinephrine?”</p>

      <p>“As an infectious disease epidemiologist, having my husband dying from a superbug was just a shock,” says Steffanie Strathdee. In 2015, Strathdee’s husband was near death from an infection of antibiotic-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>. Starting with a simple PubMed search, Strathdee <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-50221375">brought together a “global village” of phage experts</a> to save his life.</p>

      <p>For <i>Nature’</i>s 150th anniversary, we asked readers aged between 18 and 25 to tell us, in no more than 1,000 words, what scientific advance they would most like to see in their lifetimes, and why it mattered to them.</p>
      <p>The winner is psychology PhD student Yasmin Ali, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03358-x">whose compelling essay</a> is about Beethoven, her twin brother’s hearing loss and the science she hopes will one day cure it. It stood out to the judges as a reminder of why many scientists do research: to make the world better tomorrow than it is today.

      <p>Physicist Robert Schittko was a runner-up for his proposal that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03359-w">nuclear fusion could offer a solution to the climate crisis</a>, in a piece that effortlessly mixes grand ambition with gentle humour.

      <p>And chemist Matthew Zajac was also a runner-up for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03360-3">his powerful personal account</a> of why he wants to see advances in the field of same-sex reproduction.

      <h4>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h4>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03356-z">“It may be, that long after the theories of the philosophers whose achievements are recorded in these pages, are obsolete, the vision of the poet will remain as a truthful and efficient symbol of the wonder and the mystery of Nature.”</a>

      <p>In 50 years, they might look back on us and laugh — but Goethe will stand the test of time, wrote biologist Thomas Henry Huxley in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03356-z">the opening article of the first issue of </a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03356-z"><i>Nature</i></a><i> </i>on 4 November 1869.</p>
