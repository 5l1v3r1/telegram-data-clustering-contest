04 Nov 2019 by Aly Walansky
Foie Gras has long been a delicacy enjoyed by many, but also attached to some controversy. This dish, involving liver of a duck or goose, is rich and fatty, all the ingredients of a proper indulgence. However, because of the method in which the duck or goose’s liver is fattened, there’s been a lot of backlash, and now foie gras has been banned in a few places. First, it was banned in California, and now it was just banned in New York City.Restaurants have a few years before the ban takes effect, though. So for anyone who truly loves foie gras, here’s some special dishes that incorporate it. These are all in New York City, where the ban will go into effect in 2022. There’s time to enjoy them while you still can!

At Aquavit in New York City, served as an amuse, diners can begin the chef's tasting with a Foie Gras Tartelette served with sea buckthorn. ""It's a classic whole wheat tartlet filled with foie gras mousse and is topped with sea buckthorn gel and fleur de sel. The balance between the fatty foie gras and the bright sea buckthorn is a perfect combination. You need something as bright as sea buckthorn to break through the fat that is in the foie gras,” said chef Emma Bengtsson of Aquavit.
