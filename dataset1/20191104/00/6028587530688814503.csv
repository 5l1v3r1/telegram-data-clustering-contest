Billionaire Leon Cooperman Escalates Feud With Elizabeth Warren

Topline: Wall Street is worried about Elizabeth Warren—and one of her most outspoken critics, billionaire hedge fund founder Leon Cooperman, continued to admonish the progressive 2020 candidate in a Monday interview with CNBC for her “vilification” of the ultrarich, saying that “what she’s peddling is bull, total and complete bull.” 

In a Monday interview with CNBC, Cooperman—who is worth $3.2 billion, according to Forbes—said that while he believes in a progressive tax structure, Warren’s proposed wealth tax is “morally and socially bankrupt.”
He said he eventually wants to donate his fortune but doesn’t want the government controlling where his money goes. Warren says her proposed “ultra-millionaires” tax will bring in trillions and fund ambitious social programs such as Medicare-for-all, free college and universal childcare.
The interview comes days after Cooperman wrote a five-page letter to Warren in one of the most public rebukes of the 2020 hopeful by a billionaire to date.
Since writing the letter, Cooperman said he hasn’t heard from Warren, but would be open to meeting with her.
Warren’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Forbes, but she did tweet last week that “Leon can and should pitch in more—so that every kid has the same opportunities he did to succeed.”

Crucial quote: “She’s screwing around with the wrong guy. I want to give it all away, but I want to control the decision. I don’t want the government giving away my money. The idea of vilifying wealthy people is so bogus,” Cooperman said in the CNBC interview.
Key background: The feud between Cooperman and Warren began last week and has since escalated into a heated back-and-forth. The first blow came after Cooperman told Politico he thinks Warren’s rhetoric against billionaires is “sh*tting” on the “f*cking American dream.” Warren responded in a tweet, saying that Cooperman should “pitch in a bit more so everyone else has a chance at the American dream.” 
And then later, Cooperman wrote a five-page letter to Warren where he likened that tweet to a “parent chiding an ungrateful child.” In the letter, he also praised how wealthy people like himself donate their fortunes to philanthropic causes and took issue with Warren’s numbers underpinning her wealth tax proposal. 
News peg: Warren and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders are tapping into a wave of anticapitalist and anti-billionaire sentiment on the progressive left, propelling them to the top of some recent polls. Warren’s populist message in particular has rattled those on Wall Street.
