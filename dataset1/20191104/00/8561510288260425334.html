      <h1>Microsoft Japan Tried a Four-Day Workweek. Productivity Spiked.</h1>

      <h3>Summer Study</h3>
      <p>In August, Microsoft Japan closed its offices on Fridays, treating 2,300 employees to a month’s worth of three-day weekends.</p>
      <p>With workers only at their desks four days instead of five, you might think they got less done during the week. Instead, productivity <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/04/microsoft-japan-4-day-work-week-experiment-sees-productivity-jump-40percent.html">spiked by nearly 40 percent</a> — a sign that proponents of the four-day workweek might be onto something, even in Japan’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39981997">famously workaholic</a> corporate culture.</p>
      <h3>Sayōnara, Karoshi</h3>
      <p>Microsoft Japan published a <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/ja-jp/2019/10/31/191031-published-the-results-of-measuring-the-effectiveness-of-our-work-life-choice-challenge-summer-2019/">report</a> on August’s experiment on Thursday. In addition to the extra days off, the office also set a time limit of 30 minutes for meetings and encouraged employees to communicate online rather than face-to-face when possible.</p>
      <p>Sales per employee increased by 39.9 percent during the trial compared to August 2018’s figures, and an employee satisfaction survey found that 92.1 percent of workers liked the switch to a four-day workweek.</p>
      <p>Closing the office on Fridays positively affected the company’s environmental impact as well, with Microsoft Japan reporting a 23.1 percent decrease in electricity use and a 58.7 percent decrease in the number of pages employees printed.</p>
      <h3>Future of Work</h3>
      <p>With automation poised to take over many tasks currently tackled by humans, people across the globe have started pondering what it could mean for the future of work.</p>
      <p>Virgin CEO <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/richard-branson-four-day-wekeends-job-automation">Richard Branson</a> and Google co-founder <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2014/07/09/millionaires-support-four-day-work-week-.html">Larry Page</a> are among those who’ve suggested shortening the workweek, and Microsoft Japan isn’t even first to actually put the theory to the test. In 2018, a legal document firm in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/02/no-downside-new-zealand-firm-adopts-four-day-week-after-successful-trial">New Zealand</a> made the switch — and it found “no downside” to the change.</p>
