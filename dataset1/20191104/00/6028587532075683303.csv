Topline: In one of the more prominent punishments laid down by Epic Games, professional player Faze Jarvis has been dealt a lifetime ban from Fortnite after posting videos of himself cheating.

The video focused on Jarvis’ use of an aimbot, an illegal cheating tool that automatically places the player's crosshairs directly onto enemies.
In the now-deleted video, Jarvis explained that he made a new account and was using a different computer because, “When you make a new account and you use aimbot, you’ll get banned really easily. ... I’m not trying to get banned instantly.”
In a tearful apology video, Jarvis said he wouldn’t be where he is without Fortnite and that “it didn't even cross my mind to think that I could be banned for life on Fortnite.”
While Jarvis was not playing in the World Cup qualifiers or an esports event, he was still playing in a public online match with normal, random players.
Fortnite’s online FAQ explicitly forbids aimbots, saying, “We take cheating very seriously on both a legal and game development front. We don’t want to tip our hand by talking in-depth about how we combat cheating. Cheaters are permanently banned across all Epic products.”
Jarvis is a member of popular esports organization Faze Clan and has 2 million subscribers on YouTube and 170,000 followers on Twitter.

Key Background: Epic has dealt with Fortnite cheaters a few different ways now. Earlier this year, two players were caught colluding during the Fortnite World Cup online qualifiers. Epic banned both for two weeks, but they were still able to collect enough points to qualify for the $30 million tournament held in Queens. In other circumstances, the company has even gone to court against cheaters, last month settling a case against a minor who both posted YouTube videos of cheats and sold cheating software.
Big Number: In 2017, Blizzard Entertainment won an $8.6 million judgment against a cheating software developer, according to Polygon.
