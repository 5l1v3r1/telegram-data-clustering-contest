        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was almost 40 years ago, on Nov. 4, 1980, when Republican <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Ronald Reagan</a> <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?418300-1/reagan-victory-speech">defeated</a> Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter at the presidential ballot box, ushering in what some historians have since referred to as the “Reagan Era” — what conservatives and patriots and lovers of freedom have since recalled, with utmost fondness, as a time of American prosperity, global leadership and, sigh, proper placement of government.</p>
      <p>My, the times have changed.</p>
      <p>Yet the spirit of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a> still soars throughout the land.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a>, decades after his presidency, has remained the go-to guy on the political stage against which all conservative contenders are compared.</p>
      <p>“GOP to Romney: You’re no <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a>,” Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2012/09/romneys-reagan-fallacy-081566">wrote</a> in 2012.</p>

      <p>“John McCain Compares Sarah Palin To <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Ronald Reagan</a>,” The Huffington Post <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/john-mccain-sarah-palin-ronald-reagan_n_788948">wrote</a> in 2010.</p>
      <p>“Donald Trump, you’re no <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Ronald Reagan</a>,” one columnist <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/donald-trump-youre-no-ronald-reagan">wrote</a> in The Washington Examiner in 2018.</p>
      <p>“Why ‘the Donald’ is the new ‘<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Ronald</a>‘: Parallels between Trump and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a>,” another columnist <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/2019/06/10/parallels-between-trump-reagan-show-why-donald-new-ronald/1367579001/">wrote</a> in the Des Moines Register in June.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Even libs want in on the man.</p>
        <p>“Is Obama the New Reagan?” the Brookings Institution <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/is-obama-the-new-reagan/">wondered</a> in a 2008 headline.</p>
        <p>“Obama, you’re still no <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a>,” CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/17/politics/obama-reagan-compare/index.html">concluded</a> in a 2015 headline.</p>
        <p>And from Obama himself, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/cuba-opening-ushers-in-era-of-mas-obama-119652">came</a> this — from a headline in Politico in 2015: “Obama: I’m <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a> and Hillary can be Bush 41.”</p>
        <p>Problem is: Nobody is like <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a>.</p>
        <p>Not really. Not completely.</p>
        <p>His spirit of good governance mixed with humble service mixed with bold leadership and dashed with surprisingly sly and sometimes self-deprecating humor has proven tough to clone.</p>
        <p>And on top of all that, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a> had a quality that insistently, courageously, ambitiously and persistently pushed forward an America First agenda — without even having to go through the trouble of coining an America First message. He just was. It was part of his makeup; his compass; his DNA.</p>
        <p>What a contrast he made to Carter at a time when Carter Politics were killing the nation.</p>
        <p>“I’ve said before the difference between Carter and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a> was, if you asked Carter what time it was, he’d tell you how to build a watch. If you asked <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a> what time it was, he’d say, ‘It’s time to get this country moving again,’ ” <a href="https://www.craigshirley.com/">said</a> Craig Shirley, one of the nation’s premier <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a> historians, with a bestselling background that includes authorship of numerous books on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a> and his many campaigns, in an email to The Washington Times.</p>
        <p>In 1980, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a> and Carter were as different as night and day.</p>
        <p>“<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a> wanted people to have more,” Shirley remembered. “Carter wanted people to have less. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a> talked about growing hope and opportunity and Carter talked about an era of limitations. … Carter believed in co-existence and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a> said we could and would transcend the Soviet Union.”</p>
        <p>The Great Communicator? Try, the Great Doer.</p>
        <p>Well, those days have passed.</p>
        <p>It’s 2019.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a> is gone. Carter is an elderly man. President Donald Trump is the face of the White House. And socialists — open socialists! — are filling our local offices, moving into our federal buildings, running for our highest political positions in the land.</p>
        <p>The times have certainly changed.</p>
        <p>But then again — this, from Shirley: “Carter’s 1980 platform said government’s most important product was jobs. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a>’s platform said freedom [and free markets] created hope, opportunity and jobs.”</p>
        <p>That rings a lot like today’s political platforms — like the stuff and nonsense the left is trying to sell versus the common sense citizens-first ideal that conservatives, at least most of ‘em, are still fighting to preserve.</p>
        <p>Individual freedom versus government control.</p>
        <p>Self-reliance and private sector innovation versus federal regulation and redistribution.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a>, God rest his soul, knew which side of the fight was the winning side.</p>
        <p>“<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a> has gone down in history as one of our greatest presidents,” Shirley said. “Carter has gone down in history as one of our worst presidents.”</p>
        <p>Yes, indeed. The spirit of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a> still lives. Thank God; the spirit of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a> still soars free throughout America.</p>
