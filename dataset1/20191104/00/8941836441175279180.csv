Longest stretch of Maine’s moose hunt getting started

04 Nov 2019

OXFORD, Maine (AP) - The longest stretch of Maine’s annual moose hunt is taking place in some central and western parts of the state.
Maine’s “any moose” hunt runs from Monday to Nov. 30. Hunters are allowed to harvest moose of either sex during this part of the hunt, which is limited in terms of geography.
The “any moose” hunt is restricted to two wildlife management districts. Hunters are advised to check with authorities before hunting. They must also have a moose permit. The state used a lottery to give out the permits earlier this year.

The state’s bear, deer and turkey seasons are also all taking place. The turkey season ends Nov. 7 and the bear season ends Nov. 30. Deer season lasts until Nov. 30 and some archery’s legal until Dec. 14.
