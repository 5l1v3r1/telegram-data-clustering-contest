      <p>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - Police said Monday they’re investigating a member of K-pop superstar group <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bts/">BTS</a> over a traffic accident that left him and a taxi driver with minor injuries.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bts/">BTS</a>‘ agency, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/big-hit-entertainment/">Big Hit Entertainment</a>, said 22-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jungkook/">Jungkook</a> admitted that he caused the accident by violating traffic laws and reached a settlement with the driver. The agency said the singer and driver both avoided serious injury. </p>
      <p>“We apologize again to the victim and also to fans for causing concern,” the agency said in an emailed statement. </p>
      <p>Seoul police said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jungkook/">Jungkook</a> was booked and an investigation of his case was underway in line with traffic law.</p>
      <p>A police officer in charge of traffic accidents in Seoul described the case as minor because the incident did not cause much human or property damage. The officer, who requested anonymity because the investigation was underway, also said the case didn’t involve drunken driving or any other serious offenses.</p>
