      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - The Golden Globe Awards will give its new TV special achievement trophy to someone who has been a pioneering sitcom star, a TV talk-show host and a game-show MC - Ellen DeGeneres.</p>
      <p>The Hollywood Foreign Press Association said Monday that the Carol Burnett Award - the small-screen version of the group’s film counterpart, the Cecil B. DeMille Award - will go to DeGeneres, a multiple Emmy winner and Golden Globe nominee.</p>
      <p>It is given annually to honor someone “who has made outstanding contributions to television on or off the screen.” The first Carol Burnett Award last year fittingly went to Burnett herself.</p>
