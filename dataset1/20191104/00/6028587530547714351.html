      <p>The BBC’s commercially funded international 24-hour English-language news platform BBC World News is to screen a half-hour TV program on the impact of bicycles on world trade. “Bicycles” is the penultimate episode in the new eight-part <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/made-on-earth/"><i>Made on Earth</i></a> series. This explores the networks, people, and places behind products that have helped shape the global economy.</p>
      <p>The program states that bicycles are “the most popular form of transport on the planet.”</p>
      <p>Presented by Babita Sharma and Finn Aberdein, the multi-platform series—sponsored by FedEx— includes an <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/made-on-earth/an-ordinary-bicycles-epic-journey/">online feature article</a> as well as the TV program. Other episodes in the series feature spices, paper, coffee, flowers, whisky, handbags, and semiconductors.</p>
      <p>Head of Editorial for BBC Global News Mary Wilkinson said: “Trade is right at the heart of what drives our economies. <i>Made on Earth</i> takes the long view and explores how we got here by revealing the intricate global networks behind eight everyday products, from spices to semiconductors, handbags to bicycles.”</p>
      <p>The bicycles episode features British folding bike manufacturer Brompton.</p>
      <p>Managing director Will Butler-Adams says: “We rely on a diverse global supply chain: rims from Belgium, titanium from China, metal from Taiwan, hub gears from America. We are buying raw materials from one market and selling them back to [that] same [market].”</p>
      <p>There’s also an appearance from Firoza Suresh, Mumbai’s first <a href="https://bycs.org/our-work/bicycle-mayors/">“bicycle mayor.”</a> At college, she was the only young woman who traveled on a bicycle.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t have a bicycle stand in my college,” she says.</p>
      <p>But Suresh’s enthusiasm soon caught on among her peers, and the college had to adapt.</p>
      <p>“Because so many people started cycling, then the college decided they needed a cycle stand,” she told the BBC.</p>
      <p>Today, much of Suresh’s work as volunteer bicycle mayor depends on cooperation between government officials to establish and maintain public services such as installing cycleways and providing bike-sharing schemes.</p>
      <p>“Cycling takes place on public property, so cyclists need a better relationship with mayors and public officials,” agrees Morgan Lommele, director of state policy at <a href="https://peopleforbikes.org/">People for Bikes</a>, a U.S. industry coalition.</p>
      <p>She adds: “Policy plays a huge role in bike safety and whether or not people will choose to bike.” </p>
      <p><i>Made on Earth</i> airs at 0230 and 0830 GMT on Saturdays and 1430 and 2130 GMT on Sundays on BBC World News. The bicycles episode will air on November 9 and 10 when it will also be available in the U.K. on BBC Reel.</p>
