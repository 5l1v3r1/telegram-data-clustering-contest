      <p><b>Topline: </b>In one of the more prominent punishments laid down by Epic Games, professional player Faze Jarvis has been dealt a lifetime ban from <i>Fortnite </i>after posting videos of himself cheating.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The video focused on Jarvis’ use of an aimbot, an illegal cheating tool that automatically places the player's crosshairs directly onto enemies.</li>
        <li>In the now-deleted video, Jarvis explained that he made a new account and was using a different computer because, “When you make a new account and you use aimbot, you’ll get banned really easily. ... I’m not trying to get banned instantly.”</li>
        <li>In a tearful apology video, Jarvis said he wouldn’t be where he is without <i>Fortnite </i>and that “it didn't even cross my mind to think that I could be banned for life on <i>Fortnite</i>.”</li>
        <li>While Jarvis was not playing in the World Cup qualifiers or an esports event, he was still playing in a public online match with normal, random players.</li>
        <li><i>Fortnite’</i>s online FAQ explicitly forbids aimbots, saying, “We take cheating very seriously on both a legal and game development front. We don’t want to tip our hand by talking in-depth about how we combat cheating. Cheaters are permanently banned across all Epic products.”</li>
        <li>Jarvis is a member of popular esports organization Faze Clan and has 2 million subscribers on YouTube and 170,000 followers on Twitter.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Key Background: </b>Epic has dealt with <i>Fortnite </i>cheaters a few different ways now. Earlier this year, two players were caught colluding during the <i>Fortnite </i>World Cup online qualifiers. Epic banned both for two weeks, but they were still able to collect enough points to qualify for the $30 million tournament held in Queens. In other circumstances, the company has even gone to court against cheaters, last month settling a case against a minor who both posted YouTube videos of cheats and sold cheating software.</p>
      <p><b>Big Number:</b> In 2017, Blizzard Entertainment won an $8.6 million judgment against a cheating software developer, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/4/15177818/overwatch-cheat-maker-sued-loses-judgment">according to Polygon</a>.</p>
