      <p>CLEVELAND (AP) - Cavaliers rookie guard <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kevin-porter-jr/">Kevin Porter Jr.</a> has been suspended by the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-basketball-association/">NBA</a> for one game without pay for bumping an official.</p>
      <p>At the end of the third quarter of Cleveland’s 131-111 loss to Dallas on Sunday night, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kevin-porter-jr/">Porter</a> brushed into referee Bill Spooner’s shoulder as he ran back down the floor after missing a shot. The contact knocked Spooner off balance, and he immediately looked at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kevin-porter-jr/">Porter</a>, who didn’t turn around.</p>
      <p>The league announced the discipline for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kevin-porter-jr/">Porter</a> on Monday.</p>
      <p>The Cavs drafted the 19-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kevin-porter-jr/">Porter</a> with the No. 30 overall pick in this year’s draft. Considered one of the most talented players available, he was passed over by some teams after being suspended for conduct issues at Southern California. He played 21 games for the Trojans.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kevin-porter-jr/">Porter</a> is averaging 5.3 points in six games for the Cavs, who host the Boston Celtics on Tuesday night.</p>
