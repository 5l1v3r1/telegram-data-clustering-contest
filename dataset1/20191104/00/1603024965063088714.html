      <p>Medicines costing less than Rs 5 per dose may be removed from price control, allowing manufacturers to raise the prices of these drugs, Business Standard <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/medicines-costing-less-than-rs-5-per-dose-may-be-taken-out-of-price-control-119110300684_1.html">reports</a>.</p>
      <p>The National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) is being updated, sources told the publication.</p>
      <p>Once these medicines are taken out of price control, drugmakers will be permitted to raise the costs by as much as 10 percent every year.</p>

      <p>“There is enough competition in the market to keep the prices of these drugs under check,” the managing director of a pharmaceutical firm told the newspaper.</p>
      <p>Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.</p>
      <p>A government official working on updating the 2015 NLEM confirmed the development to Business Standard.</p>
      <p>The Standing National Committee on Medicine (SNCM) is expected to meet early this week to discuss the subject.</p>
      <p>The industry has been pushing for this measure for almost a year, the report said. Several meeting between the government and industry stakeholders have been held since June.</p>
      <p>The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) sets the price of NLEM drugs. Around 375 drugs, including medical devices such as stents, were included in the NLEM 2015.</p>
      <p>The SNCM has also asked the industry for feedback on cancer drugs, penicillin preparations, cardiology medicines and anti-microbial resistance, the report said.</p>
      <p>Prices of some cancer, diabetes and cardiac medicines could be lowered, the report said.</p>
      <p>The government might also update the list of antibiotics, excluding the ones Indians have become resistant to and adding new ones, it added.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
