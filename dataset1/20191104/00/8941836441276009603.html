      <p>LEBANON, Ohio (AP) - A harness racing track and casino in Ohio has proposed a $100 million expansion project.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami-valley/">Miami Valley</a> Gaming and Racing in southwestern Ohio’s Warren County is considering adding a hotel, restaurant, parking garage and additional gambling machines.</p>
      <p>Domenic Mancini, the racino’s president and general manager, says the expansion will allow the racino to attract business from other major cities beyond Cincinnati and Dayton.</p>
      <p>The project will create around 300 jobs during construction and about 100 permanent positions. It’s expected to be completed during the first half of 2021.</p>
      <p>The proposed hotel will have 194 rooms. The parking garage will have spaces for about 1,000 cars.</p>
