DNR finds more carcass disposal bins as deer season nears
04 Nov 2019 by STEVE KARNOWSKI
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Wildlife managers say they’re close to rounding up enough trash bins to dispose of deer carcasses in zones of Minnesota where they’re trying to stop the spread of chronic wasting disease.
One vendor, Waste Management, recently decided not to accept carcasses that potentially might be contaminated. That has sent the Department of Natural Resources scrambling to find replacements ahead of Saturday’s firearms deer season opener.
DNR wildlife health program supervisor Michelle Carstensen told reporters Monday she’s not sure if they’ll hit their goal of 26 dumpsters statewide, but there’s a good chance they’ll have 20.

The DNR requires hunters in parts of southeastern, central and north-central Minnesota where diseased deer have been found to submit their deer for mandatory testing urges them to use designated bins for disposing of carcasses.
