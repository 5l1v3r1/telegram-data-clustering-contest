New gluten-free and vegan Falafel mixes



Plant-based brand Artisan Grains is launching a trio of gluten-free and vegan Falafel mixes across the UK and Europe.
The Falafel come in three 'on-trend' flavours including Beetroot & Chilli, Pumpkin & Quinoa and Super Greens.
All three are made with a base of ground chickpeas, herbs and spices with the addition of 'natural, healthy ingredients' including broccoli pearls, beetroot pieces and whole quinoa. They are all natural, high in protein, gluten-free, vegan, palm-oil free and contain no added sugar.
André Aires, Business Development Manager at Artisan Grains, said: “Alongside the increase in vegan diets and a desire for healthier meat-free foods, we’re seeing a real demand for better tasting plant-based and cruelty-free foods, especially when it comes to Falafel.​
“​Falafels have been an important plant-based staple for hundreds of years and their current surge in popularity has a lot to do with the fact that they’re a great meat-free source of protein, they’re crunchy and delicious to snack on, and they go well with so many different types of foods.”​
Each six x 150g box of mix makes over 20 Falafel balls and serves four, with a recommended retail price of £1.89.

Juste Pressé intoduces orange and pomegranate drink



Juste Pressé has unveiled a new orange and pomegranate drink. According to the French company, it has counterbalanced the slightly ‘pungent’ taste of pomegranate juice with the sweet taste of orange, resulting in a delicious slightly acidic juice.
As for the health benefits, pomegranate and orange bring all the richness of plants: vitamins, antioxidants and minerals making it ideal for our immune system and or for strengthening cells, said the company. 
The juice is obtained from a High Pressure Refrigeration process which preserves most of the nutritional properties of the juices and 96% of preserved antioxidants without additives or preservatives and no added vitamins.
The 500 ml bottles will be available from mid-November at a RRP of €3.95.

Gourmet instant noodles hit Ireland



Mr Lee’s Pure Foods has launched three of its six Asian inspired instant ‘gourmet noodles’ with selected SuperValu stores across Ireland.
The noodles are made from ‘the finest ingredients and flavours and are uniquely crafted from authentic Asian recipes’.
They are loaded with the finest freeze-dried veggies, air-dried Vietnamese rice noodles, herbs, spices and traditional chef-crafted broths to create a real food experience vs. traditional cup noodles. They are also low in saturated fats, calories, Sugarwise certified low in sugar and gluten-free (by Coeliac UK), palm oil free and always guarantee ‘No Nasties’ across the entire range. 
There are six flavours available in the range, but it is the vegan friendly Zen Garden Vegetables (registered by the Vegan Society), the award-winning Coconut Chicken Laksa and the bestseller Hong Kong Street Beef that are available from selected SuperValu stores across Ireland at a RRP of €2.95.
“Perfect for the busy parent or time-poor professional, our noodles are ideal for anyone looking for a healthier way to eat, without giving up on taste or convenience. We’ve worked hard to make sure each and every cup contains a restaurant-calibre dish, authentic in taste and texture to the oriental cuisine you’d expect from any top noodle bar​,” said Damien Lee, Founder and CEO of Mr Lee’s Pure Foods Co.
