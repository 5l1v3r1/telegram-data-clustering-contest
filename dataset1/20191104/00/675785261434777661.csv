Pete Townshend has admitted he found the wild antics of his bandmates, especially the late Keith Moon, a “waste of time”.
The Who guitarist, 74, said he looked down on the drummer during his destructive excesses and described him as a “prat”.
Townshend said: “I was always pretty snobby about rock and roll.
""As the television went through the window, I would look at Keith Moon and go, ‘what a f***ing prat. What a waste of time’.
“Then, two or three times I did the same thing, I’d think, ‘what a f***ing prat’. I was in it for the art. I felt we should confine our antics to the stage.”

Townshend, who admitted he “had some times” himself, said he did not count using heroin or cocaine among his finest moments.
He put The Who’s longevity – 55 years – down to its faithful male fans, rather than “fickle” teenage girls.
He said: “They still roll up to see us… and they’re incredibly loyal. It’s like they’re following a crap football team and they don’t care how badly we do.”
