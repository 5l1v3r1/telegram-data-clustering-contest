Walmart Black Friday 2019: Here Are The First DealsForbes Gordon Kelly

 While eyes will turn to the Galaxy S10 and Note 10 deals, beware that discounts with be circa $300 (and $400 from Costco) on Black Friday - though expect stock levels at those prices to be extremely limited. Instead, what catches my eye are the superb TV deals available right now which are likely to match anything you will find on Black Friday itself. Only Samsung.com’s typically late entry into Black Friday should give you pause for thought here because it is famed for late and great bargains. 
For my dedicated store-by-store, Black Friday live deals guides you can check out available Amazon deals here, available Best Buy deals here, available Walmart deals here and available Apple deals here. While Black Friday 2019 shipping policies can be found for Amazon (here), Best Buy (here), Target (here) and Walmart (here).
