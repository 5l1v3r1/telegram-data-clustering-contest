      <p>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - Cyprus’ president is pledging to revoke any passports that were “mistakenly” granted to wealthy investors who were found to have committed wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nicos-anastasiades/">Nicos Anastasiades</a> says “errors” may have been made in granting such “golden passports” under an earlier, less-strict version of a lucrative investment program.</p>
      <p>He said Monday there could be “perhaps 10-15” such instances of investors whom vetting had vailed to identify as ineligible.</p>
      <p>Cypriot government spokesman Prodromos Prodromou said nearly 4,000 passports have been issued to investors since the program began following a 2013 financial crisis.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nicos-anastasiades/">Anastasiades</a> said passport revocations will happen once an ongoing investigation confirms that specific investors had breached eligibility rules.</p>
