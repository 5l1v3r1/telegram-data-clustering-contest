      <p>HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) - A West Virginia woman has been reunited with a wallet she lost in 2004.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/catrina-napier/">Catrina Napier</a> tells WCHS-TV she got the wallet back on Friday after a student found it in a Spring Valley High bathroom.</p>
      <p>Student Michael Tyree says he found the wallet in the rubble of a bathroom ceiling that collapsed. Tyree says he reached out to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/catrina-napier/">Napier</a> on social media.</p>
      <p>Among the items inside the wallet were a driver’s license, a Social Security card and high school photos.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/catrina-napier/">Napier</a> says she doesn’t know how her wallet ended up in a ceiling but suspects that pranksters were behind it. She says she’s glad to get back “a little piece of your childhood that you had forgot about.”</p>
