      <p>Pete Townshend has admitted he was “snobby” about rock and roll and viewed the wild antics of some of his musical contemporaries as a waste of time.</p>
      <p>The Who guitarist and famed rocker said he looked down on late bandmate Keith Moon during his destructive excesses.</p>
      <p>Townshend, who admits he “had some times” himself, said he did not count using heroin or cocaine among his best moments.</p>
      <p>He also told The Big Issue that he had wanted his band to be about the art, and not hurling furniture from hotel windows.</p>

      <p>He said: “I was always pretty snobby about rock and roll.</p>
      <p>“As the television went through the window, I would look at Keith Moon and go, ‘what a f***** prat. What a waste of time’.</p>
      <p>“Then, two or three times I did the same thing and I would think, ‘what a f****** prat’.</p>
      <p>“I was in it for the art. I felt we should confine our antics to the stage. Getting into auto-destruction was straight out of art college.</p>
      <p>“People still say that I should never have smashed instruments. F*** off. It is how I got you to listen to me.”</p>
      <p>Townshend, who was also principle songwriter for The Who, marvelled at the social changes which took place during the height of the band’s fame.</p>
      <p>However, he said the “minor revolutions” of the 1960s did not lead where he had hoped.</p>
      <p>The guitarist said: “My generation felt disenfranchised. That is a complex word for feeling like we had nothing to live for.</p>
      <p>“It made us not so much angry as loose. We were loose-living. And when psychedelic drugs and more importantly the pill came along, away we went.</p>
      <p>“Then we took power. But I think we misused the power to a great extent. The hippy era could have turned into something much better than it did.”</p>
