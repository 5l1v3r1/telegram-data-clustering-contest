      <p>CARSON, Calif. (KABC) -- The Los Angeles Chargers raked in another win after a 26-11 victory against the Green Bay Packers in Carson Sunday afternoon, showing a fans a glimpse of what they've been waiting for all season. It's the first time they've beaten Green Bay in 35 years.<br/><br/>The Bolts started out strong at Dignity Health Sports Park, holding Green Bay to less than 10 yards in the first quarter, a feat that hadn't been accomplished for L.A. since 2012. Joey Bosa also contributed to the early lead, making his eight sack of the season in the same quarter.<br/><br/>Kicker Michael Badley made his first appearance of the season and made up for lost time after going 4-for-4 with field goals, giving the Bolts a nine-point lead by halftime.<br/><br/>Star running back Melvin also stepped into the spotlight by scoring two touchdowns during the game, including one in the fourth quarter.<br/><br/>Their lead was threatened late in the game after a touchdown and successful two-point conversion by the Packers.<br/><br/>Saturday's game marked the debut for the Bolts new offensive coordinator Shane Steichen.<br/><br/>Steichen replaced Ken Whisenhunt, who was fired Monday, one day after the Chargers failed to score more than 20 points for the sixth time in seven games.<br/><br/><i>City News Service contributed to this report.</i></p>
