Do the stars of aspiring holiday classic Last Christmas know their classic holiday movies? We put Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding, who headline Paul Feig’s new Christmas flick, to the test with a special edition of our game, Name the Review. The game is straightforward enough: The duo reads one-liners from movie reviews of holiday classics and have to guess which movies are being reviewed. Simple right? Not as simple as it sounds.

Last Christmas is in theaters November 8.
