Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.
A government official working on updating the 2015 NLEM confirmed the development to Business Standard.
The Standing National Committee on Medicine (SNCM) is expected to meet early this week to discuss the subject.

Prices of some cancer, diabetes and cardiac medicines could be lowered, the report said.
The government might also update the list of antibiotics, excluding the ones Indians have become resistant to and adding new ones, it added.Special Thursday Expiry on 10th 7th NovEarly Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
