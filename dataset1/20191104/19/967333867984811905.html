      <p>Jordan's Prime Minister Omar al-Razzaz said as quoted by Petra news agency that the move is needed "to face up to the challenges of the coming period".</p>
      <p>The reshuffle is expected to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201806051065109731-jordan-new-government-protests/">solidify the prime minister's mandate</a> to accelerate economic reforms in the debt-ridden country.</p>
      <p>Though the scope of the reshuffle os unknown, reports suggest that it would not affect key portfolios.</p>
      <p>Razzaz was appointed last year by King Abdullah in a move to defuse tensions caused by an IMF austerity plan.</p>
      <p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201910151077055339-imf-predicts-worst-economic-growth-since-2008-financial-crisis-urges-increased-spending/">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) demanded</a> that Jordan must cut its debt to around 95 percent of the GDP. The plan led to tax hikes that, in turn, spiralled into mass protests.</p>
      <p>In recent months, the government has introduced a number of reforms aimed at raising salaries to teachers and army retirees, while lowering government revenues.</p>
