How Disney teaches kids to be suspicious
04 Nov 2019, 19:32 by Mark Frauenfelder
It's important for kids to learn that the world is replete with charlatans, mountebanks, rascals, rogues, hustlers, flim-flammers, tricksters, and con artists.
Disney is doing its part by selling a kit of ""1001 Stickers"" of famous Disney princesses like Ariel, Jasmine, etc. But when kids open the package, they'll see that 768 of the stickers are, as one disappointed Reddit user put it, ""useless fucking squares. Thanks Disney.""
Thanks, indeed! It's a cheap way to learn a valuable lesson.
1001 stickers and 768 of them are useless fucking squares. Thanks Disney. from r/assholedesign
