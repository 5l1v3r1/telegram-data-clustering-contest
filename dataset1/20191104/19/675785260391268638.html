      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T19:23:22+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 19:23</time> by <a rel="author">Amber Hicks, Kathryn Quinn, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>A mum has told how her six-year-old son died in her arms after suffering an electric shock at nursery.</p>
      <p>Elisa C could only watch in horror as youngster Antonio was electrocuted when he reportedly grabbed hold of a cable that was coming out of a broken socket.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old mum and a staff member from the nursery in Frankfurt, Germany, tried desperately to keep Antonio alive by giving him mouth-to-mouth, but tragically nothing could be done to save him.</p>
      <p>Recalling the horrific ordeal, Elisa said: "When I went to pick Antonio up, I was in the changing rooms and Antonio was running around, and suddenly he must have got hold of a cable that was coming out of a socket. The socket was hanging out of the wall."</p>
      <p>The child was catapulted towards his mum.</p>
      <p>Elisa, originally from Italy but living in Germany, continued: "It was a shock, the nursery school boss and I tried to resuscitate him, we gave him mouth to mouth and performed chest compressions. But it was too late, Antonio died in my arms.</p>

      <p>"Building works had been carried out and the nursery school had been closed. It then opened again, although it clearly was not finished.</p>
      <p>"Walls had been painted and new flooring laid, and the nursery school had to be closed."</p>
      <p>But Jan Pasternak, from the Integration and Education Department in the City of Frankfurt, said: "We are not aware of any building works being carried out at the nursery school and certainly not aware of cables coming out of the walls.</p>
      <p>"This would not be possible when the nursery school is open as normal for business."</p>
      <p>The Public Prosecutor in Frankfurt is investigating charges of involuntary manslaughter against unknown persons at this time.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Nadja Niesen: "The focus of the investigation is on whether someone acted against their duty of care."</p>
      <p>The mum is now trying to raise enough money to fly Antonio's body to Italy for burial and the parents association has set up a PayPal for donations.</p>
      <p>The nursery school remains closed while investigations are ongoing.</p>
