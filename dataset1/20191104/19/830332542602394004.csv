Roger L. Wand age 87 of Monroe, passed away peacefully on Sunday, November 3, 2019 at the Monroe Clinic Hospice Home.
Roger was born on June 13, 1932 in Gratiot, the son of Joseph and Mary J. (Gille) Wand. He graduated from Gratiot High School in 1950 and served in the U.S. Army from 1953 until his honorable discharge in 1955. Roger married Gloria A. Johnson on October 5, 1963 in Gratiot.

He was a member of St. Victor Catholic Church and the Monroe Moose Lodge #754. Roger loved being outside working in his yard, but one of his main passions was hunting.
