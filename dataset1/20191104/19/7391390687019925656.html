      <p>When you put in effort and time to style your hair, you want it to last as long as possible. That's where the right hairspray can come in handy. However, when you have been blessed with fine hair, not every hairspray will work for your thinner strands. That's why the <a href="https://www.haircareconsumers.com/best-hairspray-for-fine-hair/">best hairsprays for fine hair</a> walk the line between the two extremes, offering a medium hold minus the stiff, crunchy appearance that old school hairsprays in the past received a bad rep for. These days, hairspray options offer long-lasting control to keep styles in place. They also pull double duty as volumizers, adding fullness and shine to fine hair, as well.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind: Some heavier hairsprays can weigh down fine hair or give it an oily or sticky texture. On the flip side, if your thinner hair has a tendency to fall flat quickly, a hairspray that offers too-light of a hold won't work well, either. While you can scan the ingredients list to get a sense of which hairsprays will work for you (certain <a href="https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/styling-products/guide/hairspray-made-of">polymers are water-soluble</a> and feel lighter on your hair), I'd recommend combing the reviews. (I've got you covered here.) Reviewers with fine hair are quick to call out a hairspray that's not up to the task.</p>
      <p>For more details on the three <a href="http://ahairguide.com/2017/01/10/best-hairspray-fine-hair/">best hairsprays for fine hair</a> you can buy, keep scrolling.</p>
      <h3>1. The Overall Best: Kenra Volume Hair Spray</h3>

      </p>
      <p>Although each can only holds 1.5 ounces, this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AOA7EBI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B01AOA7EBI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=bustle-18364179-20&amp;linkId=2edb341d4617341f983863ea13cf8182">Kenra volume hair spray</a> is worth its weight in gold when you need long-lasting hold for fine hair. It lasts for up to 120 hours (that's five whole days!). Plus, if you're going somewhere windy, this hairspray is also wind-resistant up to 25 miles per hour. Manufacturers also say that this formula is humidity-resistant for up to 20 hours after application, making it perfect for any weather you encounter. Best of all, it dries quickly and adds both volume and hold without any stiff or crunchy feeling. With the backing of 3,500 Amazon fans, this is a fan-favorite choice for fine hair.</p>
      <p><b>What fans say:</b> “I have fine thin hair and this is the best hair spray I've ever used. With it, my hair doesn't look rigid, but stays put and when blown returns to the original look. The old sprays would keep my style for about an hour and then I'd suddenly have flat hair back in my eyes again. Now it stays put for hours and keeps its body but doesn't look like it's sprayed. It's more expensive than I've used before but worth every penny.”</p>
