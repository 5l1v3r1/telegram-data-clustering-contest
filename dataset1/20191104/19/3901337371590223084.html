      <p>Ernst Middendorp has said he will be looking for a different “dimension” when Kaizer Chiefs host rivals Orlando Pirates in another Soweto Derby – just seven days after dumping them out of the Telkom Knockout at the weekend. </p>
      <p>The German-born mentor is hoping to have defender Reeve Frosler and midfielder Kearyn Baccus back in contention and available for selection having sat out their victory in the cup tie at the Moses Mabhida Stadium.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“There are a number of players that we are looking at and targeting to have back for selection again next weekend, Reeve Frosler and Kearyn Baccus – that gives us a little bit of a different dimension. But it is all in the planning so we can execute it adequality,” Middendorp told reporters after the match. </p>
      <p>Baccus, who joined Chiefs at the start of the campaign and has become an instant hit with the fans, was also ruled out of the 2-0 win over reigning Absa Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns and his return would be a welcomed boost. </p>
      <p>Frosler had initially started the game against Downs, but was subbed off after he suffered a knock and was subsequently ruled out of the Soweto Derby. </p>
      <p>Chiefs are away to Chippa United on Wednesday and it’s likely Middendorp will not risk the duo with an eye on having them available for the second successive clash with Pirates in seven days – this time at the FNB Stadium. </p>
