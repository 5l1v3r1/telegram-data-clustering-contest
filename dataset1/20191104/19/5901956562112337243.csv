Ne boste verjeli, kaj se je na grobu dogajalo slovenski družini
Ne razume svaka.

Dan spomina na mrtve nikakor ne sodi med najveselejše. Obiskovanje grobov pokojnih sorodnikov, znancev in prijateljev za večino ne pomeni najprijetnejšega dela praznikov, če pa zraven prištejemo, da ta opravila pogosto potekajo v družbi družinskih članov, pa utegne biti to recept za glavobol.Nekaj takega se je zgodilo Slovenki, ki jo je pripetljaj ob letošnjem 1. novembru tako moril, da ga je razkrila na enem izmed slovenskih spletnih forumov. Opisala je, kako je bilo pri moževi družini na kosilu, in scene, ki so sledile. Za te je poskrbela partnerica moževega brata. Najprej sta zamujala na kosilo, ko pa sta po uri in pol le prišla, sta bila vsa zagrenjena. Po kosilu so odšli proti pokopališču, pa je bratova partnerica srečala prijatelje in se zapletla v klepet z njimi. Drugi so se je naveličali čakati, zato so odšli naprej proti grobu, nje pa ni bilo od nikoder. Iskali so jo po celotnem pokopališču, na koncu pa so se domov vrnili brez nje. Kasneje je sporočila, da je šla s kolegi na pijačo in naj jo partner pride iskat v mesto.»Ne razumem moških, ki si dobijo take babure, res ne!« se je nad obnašanjem svakove partnerice jezila Slovenka. Ena izmed komentatork pa je napisala, da je njen svak očitno zelo nesamozavesten moški, nekdo drug pa je vprašal, ali se boji biti samski in zato vztraja s takšno žensko.

You will not believe what happened to the Slovenian family on the grave
Not everyone understands.

Remembrance Day is by no means one of the funniest. Visiting the graves of deceased relatives, acquaintances and friends does not, for the most part, mean the most enjoyable part of the holidays. this year, on November 1, he was so mortified that she revealed it on one of the Slovenian online forums. She described how it was with her husband's family for lunch and the scenes that followed. These were taken care of by her husband's partner's partner. At first they were late for lunch, but when they were only an hour and a half away, they were all warmed up. After lunch, they went to the cemetery, but their brother's partner met friends and had a chat with them. Others got tired of waiting, so they went forward toward the grave, and she was out of nowhere. They searched for her throughout the cemetery, eventually returning home without her. She later reported that she had gone out with her colleagues for a drink and that her partner should come looking for her in the city. ""I do not understand the men who get such baboons, really not!"" However, one commenter wrote that her skin was obviously a very self-conscious man, and someone else asked if she was afraid to be single and therefore insisted on such a woman.
