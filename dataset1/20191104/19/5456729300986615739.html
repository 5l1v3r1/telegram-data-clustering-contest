      <p>Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State has sworn-in 21 newly elected local government chairmen of the state, to be fair, just and work closely with the government in discharging their duties to the people.</p>
      <p>Mr Bagudu, who made the call at the swearing in ceremony in Birnin kebbi, on Monday, advised them not to discriminate against the opposition or people who did not vote them.</p>
      <p>“You should seek the support of those that elected you, and even those that did not elect you.</p>
      <p>“You cannot achieve anything without the support of all, as the journey is difficult and the task is herculean.</p>
      <p>“In spite of the hitches and misunderstanding, 95 per cent of the local government areas have no serious issues; and we hope that there will still be amicable resolution between, and among your supporters and party members,” he said.</p>
      <p>The governor also enjoined them to create opportunities for the generation of internal revenue in order to actualise the implementation of the national minimum wage in their areas.</p>
      <p>“You should also prioritise security in your areas which is paramount and necessary for the development of our state,” he added.</p>
      <p>The governor commended the Kebbi Independent Electoral Commission (KESIEC), security agencies and election observers; as well as the media, for the peaceful conduct of the election.</p>
      <p>Responding on behalf of the chairmen, Shehu Marshall, Chairman of Jega Local Government Area, assured the governor that they would follow in his footsteps.</p>
      <p>“We will not fail you and the people of Kebbi State; as we will renew our efforts in order to achieve what is expected of us and even more,” Marshall assured.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Acting Chief Judge, Justice Sulaiman Ambursa, administered the oath on the chairmen in the presence of the governor.</p>
