      <p>The report was prepared by <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201910011076934560-britain-nick-carter-russia-cyber-threats/">the intelligence and security committee</a> and submitted to the cabinet on October 17, according to the Guardian. It was expected to be released early this week.</p>
      <p>But the government has reportedly indicated that the 50-page text would not go public before the parliament is dissolved on Tuesday, meaning its publication has been postponed until after the December 12 general election.</p>
