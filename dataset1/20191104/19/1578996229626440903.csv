04 Nov 2019, 19:25 by Alyssa Bailey
Kendall Jenner's 24th birthday celebrations started Halloween night with a big costume party complete with a photo booth and A-list guest list. But on her actual birthday yesterday, Jenner did something special with a smaller group of friends and family: She went driving on a race track. Big sister Kim Kardashian shared footage on her Twitter.
""For @kendalljenner birthday yesterday went to the race track!"" Kardashian wrote, sharing a photo and video in two tweets.






Jenner shared her own gallery of images on Instagram, writing, ""yesterday we all took our cars to the track and i learned how to drift :)))) SWIPE cuz this shit makes me happy.""



Jenner also re-posted her friend (and preferred wedding date) Fai Khadra's Instagram Story of her blowing out the candles on her baby-photo birthday cake that day. Her younger sister Kylie Jenner is right beside her:

Jenner got public Instagram birthday tributes from her two of her four sisters yesterday. Older sister Khloé Kardashian wrote, ""It’s your birthday boo!! I pray everyone is singing Happy birthday @kendalljenner!! Kendall you are one of the most loyal rare gentle souls I’ve ever known! Since the day that you were born, you have made all of my days brighter! I am so incredibly honored that I was chosen to be your sister but it’s an even bigger honor that we have chosen to be one another’s best friends. I am so lucky to have someone as selfless and loving as you by my side. I love you, I respect you, I value everything that you are. I pray today, that you are showered with love. That every wish you’ve ever had comes true! I love you so much. As lame as this sounds I feel like I love my siblings more and more every day. Happy birthday Kenny!! We celebrate you always sister 💋""



And Kim Kardashian wrote, ""My baby Kenny @kendalljenner Happy Birthday. You are the sweetest doll in the world. I wish you a lifetime of love and happiness! I love you so much and can’t wait to celebrate you today.""



Jenner's mother Kris Jenner had the most adoring post though, as mothers often do: ""Happy birthday to my beautiful angel girl @kendalljenner!!! You light up every room you walk into and everyone you meet and you light up my life every single day. You are so beautiful inside and out and I’m so proud of you Kenny!! You are the most amazing daughter, sister, friend, and I love you more than you can ever imagine. Have the best day, birthday girl!! You are my heart, ❤️ Mommy #HappyBirthdayKendall 🎂""
