      <p><b>WAREHAM, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - A Massachusetts man who officials say pulled a false fire alarm and fought emergency personnel has been charged with assault and battery.</p>
      <p>Theodore Lopes Jr. appeared in Wareham District Court Monday to face charges stemming from his Saturday arrest.</p>
      <p>Bail was set at $2,500 for the 35-year-old West Wareham man. He's due back in court Nov. 27.</p>
      <p>Fire officials say Lopes maliciously pulled the fire alarm at an apartment complex. He then tried to enter a parked van with small children in it as emergency responders were trying to evaluate him.</p>
      <p>Officials say Lopes was able to get into the driver's seat before several firefighters and two paramedics wrestled him to the ground.</p>
      <p>Lopes told police he'd pulled the fire alarm and refused officials' orders in order to get away.</p>
