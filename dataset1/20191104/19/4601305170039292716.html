      <h1>Vincent Price and Boris Karloff both used some weird ingredients in their homemade guacamole recipes</h1>

      <p>Boris Karloff and Vincent Price are perhaps the two most well-known horror movie actors in history. But that's not all they had in common—they were, apparently, both fans of homemade guacamole.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/newbeverly/status/995045920235507718">Karloff's recipe</a> was originally published in a newspaper (I couldn't track the original source, but the earliest date the image appears online is from <a href="https://classicmoviemonsters.blogspot.com/2013/02/karloffs-guacamole.html">November 2013</a>). I personally prefer a squeeze of lime, rather than lemon juice, in my guacamole, but otherwise this is pretty straight-forward—except for that little touch of sherry. I've never tried that myself, but I bet it's worth a shot.</p>
      <p>(The newspaper article also refers to this as a "sauce," which is…not how I tend to think of my guac?)</p>
      <blockquote>• 2 avocados<br/>• 1 med. tomato, chopped fine<br/>• 1 small onion, minced<br/>• 1 tbsp. chopped canned green chiles<br/>• 1 tbsp. lemon juice<br/>• 1 tsp sherry<br/>• Dash cayenne, optional<br/>• Salt, pepper<br/><br/>Peel and mash avocados. Add onion, tomato and chiles, then stir in lemon juice, sherry and seasonings to taste, blending well. Serve as a dip for tortilla pieces or corn chips or as a canape spread. Makes 10 to 12 appetizer servings.Peel and mash avocados. Add onion, tomato and chiles, then stir in lemon juice, sherry and seasonings to taste, blending well.

      <p>It was much easier to trace the source for <a href="https://twitter.com/Jenn_Benn/status/924706087617617920/photo/4">Vincent Price's recipe</a>, which was published in a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/10/30/452660436/back-from-the-dead-horror-icon-vincent-price-s-cookbook-revived">cookbook</a> that he and his wife put out in 1965. He prefers his guac with coriander as well as…Worcestershire sauce and mayonnaise?</p>
      <blockquote>• avocados<br/>• onion<br/>• Worcestershire sauce (optional)<br/>• ground coriander<br/>• salt<br/>• garlic<br/>• tomato<br/>• mayonnaise<br/>• lemon<br/>• cayenne pepper (optional)<br/><br/>1. Peel and seed: 2 large avocados. Save the seeds. Mash avocados with a fork.<br/><br/>2. Add: 3 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 small onion, chopped fine, 1 small green chili, chopped fine, 1/8 teaspoon of ground coriander, salt to taste, 1/2 clove garlic, minced, 3 tablespoons mayonnaise, 1 tomato, peeled, seeded, and chopped, 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce (optional), and a dash of cayenne pepper (optional).<br/>3. Leave the avocado seeds in the mixture until ready to serve, and they will prevent discoloration. If you like a very smooth guacamole, remove the seeds and put mixture into blender container and blend on high speed for about 8 seconds before you are ready to serve it.</blockquote>
      <p>I can imagine a world where this is <i>fine</i>, in that overly-smooth-store-bought kind of way. I just personally prefer not to live in that world. <a href="https://www.myrecipes.com/extracrispy/guacamole-throwdown-vincent-price-boris-karloff">Kat Kinsman at Extra Crispy</a> tried to re-create both recipes, and said of Price's mayo-slop: "If I'd been served this blindfolded, I'd have assumed that someone was shoveling Big Mac Secret Sauce onto my tongue, and that's just horrifying when you've been promised guacamole."</p>
