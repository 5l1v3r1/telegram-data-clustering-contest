      <p>The likes of iQOO Neo with Snapdragon 855, Galaxy A90 5G and Meizu 16T closely follow. However, the Huawei Mate X with Kirin 980 ranks lower than many flagships. It is worth mentioning that this is also the first performance ranking of a smartphone with the new Kirin 990 5G SoC. According to the ranking, the performance of Kirin 990 5G is between Snapdragon 855+ and Snapdragon 855. In the quarterly report, the performance of the Kirin 990 has increased slightly. However, the current test data of the Mate 30 5G series is still relatively small. This means that the data is most likely unstable and the score may increase as more users handle the phone. What do you think about this ranking?</p>
