What you need to know

NBA 2K Playgrounds is a two-on-two arcade-style basketball game licensed by the NBA.
A version for Android is currently being beta-tested in select regions.
It will be a free-to-play title with a reliance on unlocking player packs and in-app purchases.

NBA 2K Playgrounds is a two-on-two arcade-style basketball game that first landed on consoles back in 2017. Now, it would seem 2K is keen on bringing the franchise to mobile as a free-to-play title, with beta testing currently underway in select regions.



2K Playgrounds features exaggerated character models and simplified gameplay that should translate well to mobile. I mean, this is a tried and tested format that we've seen before from NBA Jam. It's nice to see more sports arcade games hitting the Google Play Store, but I am discouraged by the free-to-play mechanics that 2K is building this game around.
Unlike NBA Jam, which gives you a full roster of NBA talent to choose from, NBA 2K Playgrounds has you unlocking and upgrading your favorite players using a random card pack system. That basically means you're going to need to grind away for hours or spend real money to buy card packs outright for a chance at unlocking your favorite NBA superstars.
The Google Play listing shows that the game is currently being beta-tested in select regions such as the Philippines. There's no word when the game will be ready for an official release.







It's Back This new Android Auto app fixes a problem Google created for newer phones Android Auto for phone screens has finally been released for users who lost access to Android Auto after the Android 10 update.








A decent mid-ranger The Nokia 6.2 arrives in the U.S. with Android One for $249 The Nokia 6.2 with triple rear cameras and stock Android is now available in the U.S. for $249.








New patch time Have you downloaded the November 2019 security patch? Google is now rolling out the November 2019 security patch to Pixel devices. Have you gotten your hands on it yet?








Now you have no excuses These are the best games included at launch with Google Play Pass At launch, the Google Play Pass is already packed with some of the best indie games released for Android in the past 10 years.
