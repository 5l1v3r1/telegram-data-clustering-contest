President Donald Trump must declare the 8-year tax bill
04 Nov 2019, 19:00 by Ahmed Abba

The United States Court of Appeals has rejected President Donald Trump's request to declare an 8-year tax bill proposed by a court, a move that is likely to force him to declare his assets.

Three court judges in Manhattan have rejected Trump's appeal, citing a lower court ruling that the president was unfit to file a tax return.
The judges said they based their testimony on the evidence before them and the US's position that no one was above the law.
The ruling, a new development over the years, has allowed the president to disclose a copy of the tax bill, as he promised during a public campaign, but he remained silent.
