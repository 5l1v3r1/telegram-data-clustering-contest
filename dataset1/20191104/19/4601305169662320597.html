      <h1>The mysterious correlation between avocado and Bitcoin prices</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T19:14:54+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 19:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/thomdunn" target="_blank">Thom Dunn</a></address>
      <p>For a while, I blamed myself. I had that noticed my paltry Bitcoin investment was doing well, so I threw some extra cash in, just to say what it would do. That was just this past July. Days later, the value tanked. By September, I was down nearly 25 percent. Things have started to settle, but it's seemed so unpredictable that I've been hesitant to celebrate.</p>
      <p>Now I know the truth. It wasn't my fault. It was the avocados—those same god damn avocados that ruined everything for millennials like me. But at least I got to enjoy them for cheaper while I stuffed my face to escape the pain of my crashing investment.</p>

      <p>This isn't the first time someone has noticed the correlation, either. Back in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/avocadocoin/">April</a>, the price of both jumped 35 percent. The avocados made sense—at the time, Trump had threatened to completely close the US-Mexico border, which would have seriously diminished our access to those delicious <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/avocado-history-word-testicle-2018-6">Aztesticles</a>. Of course, we can always grow more avocados, whereas there will only ever be a finite <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4082979-much-bitcoin-lost-forever">21 million theoretical Bitcoins</a> in the world.</p>
      <p>Clearly, there's a deeper meaning here. Correlation is not <i>necessarily</i> causation, it's true. But it's hard to deny the synchronicity, so weighted as it is with meaning. Perhaps the answer lies in the last untried home investment for millennials: <i>Bitcoin Toast.</i></p>
      <p>Think about it.</p>
