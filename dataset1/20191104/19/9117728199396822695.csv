Bottas ""gaining good momentum"" to challenge Hamilton for 2020 title
04 Nov 2019, 19:01 by Adam Newton

Valtteri Bottas says that he can give Lewis Hamilton a run for his money next season as he looks to build on the momentum he has gained in the last few races. Bottas has picked up more points than any other driver in the last three rounds, having taken wins in both Japan and the United States.

Bottas started the year in great form, picking up two wins in the first four races, but hasn't been able to sustain that level of performace throughout the season, leading to Hamilton securing his sixth F1 title with second place in Austin.
Bottas said: “First of all huge congratulations to Lewis – six championships is an impressive achievement. He had a strong season and he deserves the title, he was better overall.

“Lewis is a tough opponent, he has very few weaknesses, makes almost no mistakes and drives very consistently. But I’ve been gaining some good momentum, so I’m looking forward to another close fight with him next year.”
