      <h1>Tyson Fury to replace Dillian Whyte as Deontay Wilder's 2020 mandatory challenger</h1>
      <h2>Whyte is currently under investigation by UK Anti-Doping due to an adverse finding in a drug sample</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T19:47:02+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 19:47</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> is set to replace <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dillian-whyte">Dillian Whyte</a> as the mandatory challenger to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder's</a> WBC heavyweight title.</p>
      <p>Whyte beat Oscar Rivas back in July to become WBC 'interim' champion and earn the opportunity to contest Wilder for his belt next year.</p>
      <p>But president of the WBC, Mauricio Sulaiman, confirmed this week that Whyte's mandatory status has been suspended.</p>
      <p>UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) are currently investigating an adverse finding in a drug sample provided by Whyte, which was revealed shortly after his unanimous points decision over Rivas.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old has not been banned from boxing, but his bout with Wilder will not be sanctioned until he is cleared of any wrongdoing by UKAD.</p>

      <p>The WBC has now installed Fury as mandatory challenger instead, with Whyte's shot at the belt put back to 2021.</p>
      <p>Sulaiman told <a href="https://youtu.be/fQ9Qc5kSpHk">Boxing Social</a> : "Dillian Whyte is in a process from an adverse finding from UKAD. It is highly confidential and highly legal.</p>
      <p>"We have met with Dillian Whyte, his representatives, we are doing an ongoing investigation, so the fight of Fury against Wilder in February [2020] will be the mandatory of that year.</p>
      <p>"We have set the next mandatory for February 2021. If Dillian Whyte is cleared of everything and of the process, he's confirmed as 'interim' champion and mandatory challenger.</p>

      <p>"He [would get] that secured February 2021 championship fight against the champion, whoever it isâ€¦</p>
      <p>"Dillian is not available at this moment. He's not suspended, but there's an enquiry, something that is being investigated.</p>
      <p>"His right that he earned as mandatory and 'interim' champion right now is suspended until everything is cleared."</p>
      <p>It was likely that Fury would have fought Wilder before the mandatory challenge of Whyte anyway, with the Gypsy King already revealing plans for their February bout.</p>
      <p>For Whyte it is another setback in hiis quest for a world title shot, despite him having lost just once in 27 fights (to Anthony Joshua) and being ranked at no.7 in the overall list of global heavyweights.</p>
      <p>He said back in July after revelations of the 'adverse finding' emerged: "I am so disappointed with the rubbish that has been said about me over the last few days.</p>
      <p>"I have lawyers dealing with it and I have been told that I can't talk about it for good legal reasons.</p>
      <p>"I was cleared to fight and I won that fight fair and square."</p>
