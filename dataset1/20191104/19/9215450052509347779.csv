新股中國抗體製藥抽追揸沽攻略 雲南白藥做股東 未上市先哄動｜聶振邦｜聶Sir
04 Nov 2019, 19:38 by 聶sir
【新股中國抗體製藥IPO】生物科技新股成為近期港股市場一大焦點，繼研發癌症、肝炎和衰老疾病新型療法公司亞盛醫藥－B (6855) 上市，以及於11月1日中午截止認購專注抗腫瘤全產業鏈的東曜藥業—B (1875) 後，都是內地企業；而於10月31日才開始招股的，則是香港生物科技第一股中國抗體製藥 (3681)。此股可用未上市先哄動來形容，除了成功引入千億市值的雲南白藥 (深交所代號000538) 作為基石投資者，認購金額達5,000萬美元 (折合約3.9億港元) 外，其創辦人梁瑞安更是香港土生土長的生物醫藥界標誌性人物。
中國抗體製藥創辦人經驗豐富
梁瑞安在學術上不但擁有博士資格，在分子免疫學及單克隆抗體開發領域上亦擁有豐富經驗，且是全球首名引入、發展及實現功能性人源化概念的科學家。他在CD22靶點方面擁有超過25年研究經驗，是首位成功發展人源化CD22單克隆抗體的科學家，對中國抗體製藥未來拓展以CD22單克隆抗體為基礎的創新免疫性疾病藥物及療法起著關鍵作用。中國抗體製藥定位為大中華地區少數具備全面能力的生物製藥公司之一，已建立具有產業鏈佈局的平台，標準化及系統地監控研發、臨床試驗及製造過程。


中國抗體製藥是香港生物科技第一股。

龐大需求千億市場空間
截至今年10月22日，中國抗體製藥是全球少數成功開發針對CD22的治療型裸單克隆抗體的生物製藥公司之一，並為當中唯一一家來自大中華地區的企業。而現時主打研發藥物SM03，是中國抗體製藥在開發免疫性疾病革新療法方面取得卓越成就的證明，屬於First-in-target (同類靶點首創) 藥物，具有全球利。SM03是B細胞限制性抗原CD22特有的一種特異單克隆抗體，專為治療類風濕關節炎 (RA)、系統性紅斑狼瘡 (SLE) 及乾燥綜合症 (SS) 等其他免疫性疾病而開發。迄今SM03是全球首款及唯一一款用於治療類風濕關節炎的臨床階段抗CD22單克隆抗體藥物，既已在SM03取得知識產權保護，亦能夠通過研發工作制定QC專項標準，包含市場上未有提供的CD22專有靶點細胞系列，大大提高了以提高潛在競爭對手的准入門檻。
根據中國抗體製藥招股書上弗若斯特沙利文的資料，2018年中國有590萬人被診斷患有類風濕關節炎，預期到2023年患者人數將達到610萬人，連同其他免疫疾病市場，保守估計達千億人民幣以上，龐大的病患人群及千億市場空間，勢必造就SM03可快速搶佔市場分額。


中國抗體製藥可用未上市先哄動來形容，除了成功引入千億市值的雲南白藥 (深交所代號000538) 作為基石投資者。

中國抗體製藥定價可望偏低有利進場
中國抗體製藥今次招股規模約1.82億股，於2.00億股之下反映規模不算大，扣除兩名基石投資者預期獲發介乎約4,901萬至6,192萬股後，招股規模街貨量約1.33億至1.20億股。
中國抗體製藥招股價則為7.60至9.60元，考慮到截至10月31日多達15隻股份在招股，並不排除於10月31日至11月5日招股期間，仍有新競爭對手出現進行招股，認為管理層於上市價定位也較審慎，認購者可望在中間價或以下獲發股份，製造有利的進場條件。初步目標價為上市價高30%至40%；買入價下跌30%可考慮離場。另須留意鑑於近期恆指表現波幅，存在打亂有心人部署的可能，遇上股價下挫時不進行維穩，所以投資者應嚴守止蝕為佳。
