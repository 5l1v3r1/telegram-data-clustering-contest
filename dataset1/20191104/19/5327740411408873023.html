      <h1>Surrey Eagles game benefits foundation in name of slain hockey coach</h1>
      <h2>Cloverdale Minor Hockey theme night for BCHL team this Sunday, Nov. 10</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T19:05:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 19:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/tom-zillich/" target="_blank">Tom Zillich</a></address>
      <p>The Surrey Eagles’ home game this Sunday afternoon will be played in support of the Paul Bennett Foundation.</p>
      <p>Players on the BCHL team will wear special Cloverdale Minor Hockey Association-themed jerseys during the 4 p.m. game against Langley Rivermen, and the jerseys will be auctioned off after the game.</p>
      <p>All proceeds will go to support the foundation created in honour of Bennett, a Cloverdale resident who was shot and killed outside his 67A Avenue home on June 23, 2018, in what police consider a case of mistaken identity. His killer is still on the loose.</p>
      <p>Bennett, a married father of two, was an operating-room nurse department manager at Peace Arch Hospital. In his spare time, he coached and played hockey.</p>
