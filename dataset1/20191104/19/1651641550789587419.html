      <p>As <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/photoshop-for-the-ipad-coming-soon-reportedly-rudimentary-and-missing-features/">expected</a>, Adobe today announced the availability of new <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/adobe-is-bringing-full-photoshop-cc-to-apple-ipad/">Photoshop app for Apple iPad</a>. This version 1.0 build of Photoshop for iPad supports top workflows, compositing, masking and retouching. In the coming months, Adobe will add more capabilities and workflows. As you can expect from a Photoshop app, you can open and edit your PSDs on iPad. You can also see and edit your layered documents and create with Photoshop features using mobile and touch. You can learn more about Photoshop for iPad <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/ipad.html?_branch_match_id=648873927827962875">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Adobe also announced that Illustrator will be coming to the iPad with following features at launch.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Seamless connection across your devices</b>: Everything you create in Illustrator can be saved to the Creative Cloud, which means you will be able to create on your desktop and iPad.</li>
        <li><b>Power and precision</b>: Work with Illustrator files with no loss of the detail and precision you expect from Adobe. For many designs you create today, you’ll be able to start on your iPad and finish on your iPad.</li>
        <li><b>Intuitive experience: </b>We’re rethinking the interface to help you save time and make Illustrator easier and more natural to use.</li>
        <li><b>Leverage the tablet interface:</b> Benefit from things like the camera and Apple pencil to take your designs to new places. For instance, you can take a picture of a hand-drawn sketch and Illustrator on iPad will help you transform it into vector shapes.</li>
      </ul>
