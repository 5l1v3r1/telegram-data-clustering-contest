04 Nov 2019, 19:10 by 熱話
近月「反修例」示威持續，不少被指是「愛國愛港」的店舖都成為「被裝修」的目標，美心集團首當其衝，除了旗下自家品牌的店舖遭殃，連特許經營的Starbucks也不能倖免，Starbucks行政總裁Kevin Johnson日前接受CNBC電視台訪問時，回應香港分店成為被破壞的目標﹐他表示，Starbucks在全球81個地區都有業務，經常都會遇到地緣政治問題，他最優先、最關注的是員工安全。另一邊廂，近來十分「惹火」的「美心大小姐」伍淑清又燒著一個新火頭。

在「反修例」風波之中，不時都會見到「美心大小姐」伍淑清的身影，9月初全港多間中學罷課，包括伍淑清曾任校監的中華基金中學，她聲言要開除參與罷課的師生，引起公眾嘩然；9月10日，伍淑清聯同何超瓊代表香港各界婦女聯合協進會出席聯合國人權理事會常規會議，指示威者為「暴徒」及破壞香港，成為美心集團店舖「被裝修」及被杯葛的導火線；後來她接受中央電視台《新聞聯播》訪問，直指罷課學生生的腦袋受人控制，以及發表撐警言論，事件火上加油。
中國官媒《環球時報》今天刊出伍淑清的最新專訪，她表示社會忽視國民教育，年輕人已完全被社交媒體洗腦，社會已經失去整整兩代年輕人，她會放棄這些年輕人，不會再浪費時間去跟他們講甚麼，旋即又在網上引起熱議，儘管美心集團早前已發表聲明，澄清伍淑清並沒有在公司擔任任何職位，亦無參與任何管理，不過並未能為事件降溫，這次「大小姐」的言論又再度引起爭議，真的是一波未平一波又起。

Refers to a new generation of brainwashing by social media. Miss Maxim: Give up these young people
04 Nov 2019, 19:10 by hot words
In recent months, the ""anti-revision"" demonstrations have continued. Many of the shops alleged to be ""patriotic and loving Hong Kong"" have become the targets of ""renovation"". The Maxim Group is the first to bear the brunt of the stores of its own brands, even the franchised Starbucks. Not to be spared, Starbucks Chief Executive Kevin Johnson responded to CNBC’s visit to Hong Kong’s store as a target of destruction. He said that Starbucks has operations in 81 regions around the world and often encounters geopolitical issues. The concern is employee safety. On the other side, Wu Shuqing, who is very ""hot"" recently, burned a new fire.

In the ""anti-revision"" turmoil, from time to time, I will see ""Mr. Maxim's Miss"" Wu Shuqing. In early September, many secondary schools in Hong Kong went on strike, including Wu Shuqing, the former China Supervisory School of the Superintendent. She said she would dismiss her participation. The teachers and students who stole the class caused public outrage; on September 10, Wu Shuqing and He Chaoqiong attended the regular meeting of the UN Human Rights Council on behalf of the Women's Association of Hong Kong Women's Association, instructing the promoters to be ""thugs"" and destroying Hong Kong, becoming the Maxim's shop. ""Renovated"" and the boy's fuse; later, she was interviewed by CCTV's ""News Network"", pointing to the control of the student's head, and the announcement of the police, and the incident was on fire.
Chinese official media ""Global Times"" published the latest interview with Wu Shuqing today. She said that society ignores national education. Young people have been completely brainwashed by social media. The society has lost two generations of young people. She will give up these young people and will not It was a waste of time to talk to them, and it immediately caused heated discussion on the Internet, although Maxim’s earlier issued a statement clarifying that Wu Shuqing did not hold any position in the company and did not participate in any management, but failed to cool the incident. This time, the ""Missy"" speech has once again caused controversy. It is really a wave of unrest.
