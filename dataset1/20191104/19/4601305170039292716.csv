Vincent Price and Boris Karloff both used some weird ingredients in their homemade guacamole recipes
04 Nov 2019, 19:05 by Thom Dunn
Boris Karloff and Vincent Price are perhaps the two most well-known horror movie actors in history. But that's not all they had in common—they were, apparently, both fans of homemade guacamole.
Karloff's recipe was originally published in a newspaper (I couldn't track the original source, but the earliest date the image appears online is from November 2013). I personally prefer a squeeze of lime, rather than lemon juice, in my guacamole, but otherwise this is pretty straight-forward—except for that little touch of sherry. I've never tried that myself, but I bet it's worth a shot.
(The newspaper article also refers to this as a ""sauce,"" which is…not how I tend to think of my guac?)
• 2 avocados• 1 med. tomato, chopped fine• 1 small onion, minced• 1 tbsp. chopped canned green chiles• 1 tbsp. lemon juice• 1 tsp sherry• Dash cayenne, optional• Salt, pepperPeel and mash avocados. Add onion, tomato and chiles, then stir in lemon juice, sherry and seasonings to taste, blending well. Serve as a dip for tortilla pieces or corn chips or as a canape spread. Makes 10 to 12 appetizer servings.Peel and mash avocados. Add onion, tomato and chiles, then stir in lemon juice, sherry and seasonings to taste, blending well.

It was much easier to trace the source for Vincent Price's recipe, which was published in a cookbook that he and his wife put out in 1965. He prefers his guac with coriander as well as…Worcestershire sauce and mayonnaise?
• avocados• onion• Worcestershire sauce (optional)• ground coriander• salt• garlic• tomato• mayonnaise• lemon• cayenne pepper (optional)1. Peel and seed: 2 large avocados. Save the seeds. Mash avocados with a fork.2. Add: 3 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 small onion, chopped fine, 1 small green chili, chopped fine, 1/8 teaspoon of ground coriander, salt to taste, 1/2 clove garlic, minced, 3 tablespoons mayonnaise, 1 tomato, peeled, seeded, and chopped, 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce (optional), and a dash of cayenne pepper (optional).3. Leave the avocado seeds in the mixture until ready to serve, and they will prevent discoloration. If you like a very smooth guacamole, remove the seeds and put mixture into blender container and blend on high speed for about 8 seconds before you are ready to serve it.
I can imagine a world where this is fine, in that overly-smooth-store-bought kind of way. I just personally prefer not to live in that world. Kat Kinsman at Extra Crispy tried to re-create both recipes, and said of Price's mayo-slop: ""If I'd been served this blindfolded, I'd have assumed that someone was shoveling Big Mac Secret Sauce onto my tongue, and that's just horrifying when you've been promised guacamole.""
