Prince Charles caught up in multimillion-dollar fake art scandal
04 Nov 2019, 19:02 by Zachary Halaschak
Prince Charles has reportedly become caught up in a $136 million art scandal that ended with the fraudulent paintings being removed from a property linked to the prince.
The paintings — thought to have been done by artists like Monet, Picasso, and Dali — were being displayed at the Dumfries House, where the Prince’s Foundation is based, according to the Daily Mail. The combined works were valued at around $136 million, with one supposed Monet worth almost $65 million.
The works were on loan to the house from bankrupt billionaire James Stunt, who used to be married to Formula 1 heiress Petra Ecclestone.
This week American art forger Tony Tetro said that he painted the pictures that Stunt loaned to the foundation.
“I don’t want any part of this. It has got to be stopped now rather than later. I'm told these pictures went to Dumfries House. There is no question about it: James knew they were mine,” Tetro said.
A spokesman for the Prince’s Foundation confirmed that three paintings were removed from public display at the Dumfries House.
“It is extremely regrettable that the authenticity of these particular paintings, which are no longer on display, now appears to be in doubt,” he said.
