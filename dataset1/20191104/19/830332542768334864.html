      <p>MILWAUKEE - The Milwaukee Brewers are making some roster moves. </p>
      <p>Pitcher Chase Anderson has been traded to Toronto in exchange for infielder Chad Spanberger.</p>
      <p>The crew has exercised the 2020 club option for catcher Manny Pina and declined Eric Thames' club option.</p>
      <p>Thames will now become a free agent.</p>
      <p>Good news for Milwaukee, as the team has reinstated pitcher Corey Knebel and Bobby Wahl from the 60-day injury list.</p>
      <p>Knebel missed all of the 2019 season after having Tommy John surgery.</p>
