      <h2>Four White House officials summoned by House Democrat impeachment investigators will not testify behind closed doors Monday, defying subpoenas to appear.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T19:42:55+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 19:42</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/edwin.mora.1675, Edwin Mora</a></address>
      <p>John Eisenberg, the National Security Council’s lawyer; his deputy, Michael Ellis; Robert Blair, a senior adviser to Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney; and Brian McCormack, the associate director for natural resources at the Office of Management and Budget, are all refusing to participate in their scheduled deposition Monday.</p>
      <p>House Democrats pursuing the partisan impeachment inquiry reportedly <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/news/white-house-lawyer-defies-impeachment-subpoena/">subpoenaed</a> all four to testify in private.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cBTwa6BIrrsytIaR2o1OKFVSNyAdL_mr/view">letter</a> sent to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone on Sunday, the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Office of Legal Counsel concluded that high-level presidential advisers like Eisenberg have “absolute immunity” from congressional subpoenas for testimony, CBS News <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/trump-impeachment-democrats-to-release-transcripts-live-updates-2019-11-04/">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Assistant Attorney General Steven Engel argued that White House attorney Eisenberg is under no obligation to comply with the subpoena issued by House Democrats conducting the impeachment probe.</p>
      <p>“You have asked whether the Committee may compel Mr. Eisenberg to testify,” Engel wrote in the November 3 letter.” We conclude that he is absolutely immune from compelled congressional testimony in his capacity as a senior adviser to the President.”</p>
      <p>Cipollone then informed William Burck, Eisenberg’s lawyer, that President Donald Trump “directs” the White House attorney “not to appear at the Committees deposition” Monday.</p>
      <p>CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/03/politics/officials-testify-impeachment-house-inquiry/index.html">noted</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>As more witnesses in the impeachment probe continue to refuse to give testimony, House investigators are signaling they are prepared to begin the next phase of their inquiry — even if their subpoenas are ignored across the board. A number of House Democrats told CNN that it’s time for that next step, saying they’ve already built enough evidence to advance the proceedings to the public stage.</blockquote>
      <p>House Democrats pursuing the impeachment inquiry are supposed to be trying to determine if Trump abused his power by allegedly pressuring Ukraine to investigate <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/18/report-obama-administration-rebuffed-warnings-about-corruption-linked-to-hunter-bidens-ukraine-work/">corruption</a> allegations against White House hopeful Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in exchange for aid.</p>
      <p>There are <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/30/house-impeachment-resolution-authorizes-fishing-expedition-probes-that-go-far-beyond-ukraine/">signs</a>, however, that the partisan probe may go far beyond Ukraine. Trump and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/03/politics/officials-testify-impeachment-house-inquiry/index.html">Ukraine</a> have <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/15/ukraine-foreign-minister-on-trump-zelensky-call-no-direct-order-to-investigate-bidens-no-link-to-military-aid/">denied</a> the allegation at the center of the impeachment probe — that the president leveraged aid to pressure the Eastern European country to investigate the Bidens.</p>
