New podcast: Dolly Parton's America
04 Nov 2019, 19:13 by Rusty Blazenhoff
It's hard to find someone who doesn't love Dolly Parton. Now, a recently-launched podcast goes deep into the beloved country legend's life and times to examine why she appeals to the masses. Dolly Parton's America follows her journey through her early scrappy days surviving on mustard-and-ketchup ""soup,"" to being discovered, to creating Dollywood and that's just in the first three episodes (there will be a total of nine). Good stuff!
It's hosted by Jad Abumrad, creator of Radiolab and More Perfect, who interviews Dolly herself.
Everything's coming up Dolly: This podcast isn't the only thing happening in the Dollyverse. Over on Netflix, a new series called Dolly Parton's Heartstrings begins airing November 22. Plus, she's got a new Christmas ornament.
