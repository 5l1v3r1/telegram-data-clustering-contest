      <p>ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria’s supreme court on Monday placed in custody a former culture minister over corruption allegations under former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, state television reported.</p>
      <p>Khalid Toumi became the 12th ex-minister to be detained since Bouteflika resigned in April under pressure from protesters demanding the removal of the ruling elite and the prosecution of people suspected of involvement in corruption.</p>
      <p>Toumi, who served as culture minister for 12 years, is accused of squandering public funds and awarding illegal privileges, state TV said.</p>
      <p>Her lawyer was not available for comment.</p>
      <p>Two former prime ministers have also been in detention over alleged corruption since the protests erupted on Feb. 22.</p>
      <p>Protesters now demand the cancellation of a Dec.12 presidential election, believing it will not be fair as some of Bouteflika’s allies including interim president Abdelkader Bensalah and Prime Minister Noureddine Bedui are still in power.</p>
      <p>The army is now the main player in Algeria’s politics and its chief of staff Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaed Salah has repeatedly vowed fairness and transparency for the vote.</p>
      <p>The election authority on Saturday said five candidates, including two former prime ministers, would run in the election.</p>
