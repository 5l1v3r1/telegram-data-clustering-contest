補華為禁令漏洞 傳美促限制台積電對中輸出晶片
04 Nov 2019, 19:55 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, 中央通訊社
（中央社台北4日綜合外電報導）英國金融時報（Financial Times）今天報導，美國正催促台灣政府限制台灣最大晶片製造商台積電替華為生產半導體，以及更嚴格管制對中國的科技輸出。
金融時報引述台、美政府官員指出，華府過去一年屢次要求蔡英文總統的政府，限制台積電出售晶片給華為。全球最大晶片代工製造商台積電今天對此表示，沒有收到美國或台灣政府不可以出貨給華為的要求，台積電遵循法規要求。
一名美國官員上月告訴台灣駐華府外交官，台積電替華為製造的晶片，被直接用在中國瞄準台灣的飛彈。這樣的聲明意在「暗喻」供貨給中國的風險。
在傳出美方提出這項要求之際，華府正試圖填補對華為銷售禁令的漏洞，藉此確保美國國防工業的貨源，同時抑制中國崛起成科技強權。美國現在關切的晶片，美企已不再獲准銷往中國。
中國已在加強推動民用工業與軍隊間的技術轉移，升高美國對於供應鏈的憂慮。
美方官員表示：「美國官員經常與台方人士對話，討論台灣科技供應鏈的安全與最終用途。...在這起特定案例中，我們的夥伴面臨中國直接軍事威脅，卻也是產製中國支撐軍事野心所需特定技術的少數地方之一。」
儘管華府認定台灣不太可能於明年1月總統大選前限制台積電，美國政府仍表示，台灣下一步應就與中國的晶片貿易祭出更多出口管制。這名美國官員說：「我們期待台灣在不久的將來會更仔細斟酌此事。」
根據金融時報，華府把華為列入黑名單，限制部分美企銷售商品給華為之後，台積電獲得助益。依據瑞士信貸銀行（Credit Suisse）亞洲半導體研究主管艾布蘭（Randy Abrams）估算，中國市場佔台積電第3季營收20%左右，其中華為佔比近乎一半。
報導也提到，目前業界專家對於華府能否強迫台灣採取作為，仍抱持懷疑態度。川普政府大力遊說他國禁止華為參與5G網路的行動，僅取得部分成功。（譯者：楊昭彥/核稿：林治平）1081104

Filling up Huawei as a banned loophole
04 Nov 2019, 19:55 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
The Financial Times reported today that the US is urging the Taiwan government to restrict Taiwan's largest chip maker TSMC to produce semiconductors for Huawei and to tighten its control over China's technology exports.
The Financial Times quoted Taiwanese and US government officials as saying that Washington has repeatedly asked President Tsai Ing-wen’s government to restrict TSMC’s sale of wafers to Huawei in the past year. TSMC, the world's largest chip foundry manufacturer, said today that it did not receive a request from the US or Taiwan government not to ship to Huawei. TSMC complied with regulatory requirements.
A US official told the Taiwanese diplomat last month that TSMC’s wafers for Huawei were used directly in China to target Taiwan’s missiles. Such a statement is intended to be a ""metaphor"" to the risk of supplying China.
On the occasion of the US request, Washington is trying to fill the loopholes in the Huawei sales ban, thereby ensuring the supply of the US defense industry and suppressing China's rise to become a technology power. The US is now concerned about the chip, the US companies are no longer allowed to sell to China.
China has been stepping up efforts to promote technology transfer between the civilian industry and the military, raising US concerns about the supply chain.
US officials said: ""US officials often talk to Taiwanese people to discuss the security and end use of Taiwan's technology supply chain.... In this particular case, our partners face China's direct military threat, but also support China's production. One of the few places where military ambitions require specific technology.""
Although Washington has determined that Taiwan is unlikely to restrict TSMC before the presidential election in January next year, the US government still said that Taiwan should lay more export controls on wafer trade with China. The US official said: ""We expect Taiwan to consider this matter more carefully in the near future.""
According to the Financial Times, after Washington has blacklisted Huawei and restricted some US companies from selling goods to Huawei, TSMC has benefited. According to Randy Abrams, head of Asian semiconductor research at Credit Suisse, the Chinese market accounts for about 20% of TSMC's third-quarter revenue, with Huawei accounting for nearly half.
The report also mentioned that industry experts are still skeptical about whether Washington can force Taiwan to take action. The Trump administration vigorously lobbied other countries to ban Huawei's participation in the 5G network, and only achieved partial success.
