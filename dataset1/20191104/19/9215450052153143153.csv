港式快餐店的品牌故事 維他奶、大家樂、大快活原來是三兄弟？
04 Nov 2019, 19:08 by 熱話
香港一向有不少經典品牌，不得不提的就有快餐店大家樂、大快活及維他奶，不說不知，原來他們都是三兄弟，來自香港的名門望族羅氏家族，不妨看看他們創立品牌的故事！撰文：新假期｜圖片： 圖片：RTHK-香港故事、大家樂、大快活
羅氏三兄弟創飲食傳奇 巿值超過港幣500億
羅氏家族在香港是名門望族，父親羅進興共有9個兒子，兄弟排行中，排第7的羅桂祥創辦了維他奶，排第8的羅騰祥創辦了大家樂，而排行第9的羅芳祥創辦了大快活。 這3間上市公司在港總資產超過500億港元，堪稱是飲食王國的傳奇。
看中黃豆營養價值 七哥羅桂祥創辦維他奶
七哥羅桂祥是家族中最早大學畢業的人，在上海公幹時候，偶然得知中國的大豆產量很大，而他想到大豆含有豐富營養，可以製作平價而有營養的飲品，為當時受日本侵華的港人提供日常所需，因此盟生了創立維他奶的想法。 他在1940年創立香港荳品有限公司（即維他奶前身） ，其產品在香港深受年輕人喜愛，當年更舉辦維他奶先生選舉，到訪不同學校派豆奶試飲，售價相當便宜，當年只需2毫子。直至1950年代，已達到每年賣1,200萬瓶的紀錄，可見維他奶的受歡迎程度。


七哥羅桂祥創立香港荳品有限公司（即維他奶前身） ，時至今日，其產品在香港依然深受年輕人喜愛。細路羅騰祥、羅芳祥則分別開大家樂及大快活。

八哥羅騰祥創辦大家樂 九哥羅芳祥創辦大快活
八哥羅騰祥和九哥羅芳祥原本同於香港荳品有限公司工作，而八哥羅騰祥決意開創港式快餐店先河，創立大家樂，為香港第一間快餐店。當時主要售賣漢堡包、雞髀等，亦首度引入自助餐飲模式，讓客人自助點餐和取餐，方便追求快捷效率的白領，令這個自助風氣開始流行。除了自助餐飲模式，大家樂當時也是香港首間做電視廣告的飲食公司，可見其創新大膽是其成功因素之一。


大家樂是當年首間引入自助餐飲模式的快餐店，方便追求快捷效率的白領。



大家樂第一間分店立於銅鑼灣糖街，主要賣漢堡包、雞髀、薯條。

當年的廣告更由張國榮跳舞演出，唱出當時的大家樂的口號「為你做足100分」。



大家樂的成功誘來九哥羅芳祥的仿效，在1972年羅芳祥開設連鎖式快餐店「大快活」，模仿對方的行銷手法，同樣採用自助餐飲方式，更曾進軍內地市場，可惜終告失敗，有數年的虧損，直至由第二代接手時，全面改變餐廳形象、品牌方向和食物質素，將品牌全面年輕化，讓大快活起死回生，成為香港快餐店的龍頭之一。羅氏家族在香港飲食市場佔有一個重要席位，可見他們的努力在於不斷改革創新，才能引領品牌跨越半個世紀。

在1997年，大快活更找來當時炙手可熱的謝霆鋒演出廣告。

The 8th Luo Tengxiang founded everyone, and the 9th Luo Fangxiang founded a big one. happy. The three listed companies have total assets of more than 50 billion Hong Kong dollars, which is a legend of the food kingdom.
Seeing the nutritional value of soybeans, Qi Gu Luo Guixiang founded Vitasoy
Luo Guixiang, the first brother of the family, graduated from Shanghai. When he was in Shanghai, he accidentally learned that China's soybean production was very large. He thought that soybeans are rich in nutrients and can make cheap and nutritious drinks for the Japanese invasion of China at that time. Hong Kong people provide daily needs, so the Alliance has the idea of creating Vitasoy. He founded Hong Kong Soybean Co., Ltd. (the predecessor of Vitasoy) in 1940. His products are very popular among young people in Hong Kong. In the same year, he held the election of Mr. Vitasoy, and went to different schools to send soy milk to try the drinks. The price was quite cheap. Only 2 milliseconds in the year. Until the 1950s, it had reached a record of selling 12 million bottles a year, showing the popularity of Vitasoy.

The first branch of the family is located in Sugar Street, Causeway Bay. It mainly sells hamburgers, chicken chop and French fries.

The advertisements of the year were also performed by Leslie Cheung. They sang the slogan of everyone at the time, ""Do 100 points for you.""



The success of everyone's music led to the imitation of Jiu Ge Luo Fangxiang.

The brand was comprehensively rejuvenated, and it was brought back to life and became one of the leading restaurants in Hong Kong.
