      <h1>Ojukwu’s widow slams Gov Obiano for boycotting husband’s memorial lecture</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T19:29:54+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 19:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/ssouth-east/361006-ojukwus-widow-slams-gov-obiano-for-boycotting-husbands-memorial-lecture.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>Bianca Ojukwu, wife of the late ex-Biafra war lord, Chukwuemeka Ojukwu, has expressed reservation over absence of Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra at the second memorial lecture of her husband.</p>
      <p>She spoke during the annual lecture at the Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University (COOU), Igbariam, Anambra State on Monday.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Mr Obiano was represented at the event by his deputy, Nkem Okeke.</p>
      <p>Mrs Ojukwu, who spoke shortly after the memorial lecture by Kingsley Muoghalu, a former Deputy Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), said Mr Obiano was one of the greatest beneficiaries of Ojukwu’s legacy.</p>
      <p>”Tell Obiano that there is no evil spirit in the venue of Ojukwu memorial lecture.</p>
      <p>“This is the second time the event is holding and Obiano doesn’t want to attend by himself,” Mrs Ojukwu said.</p>
      <p>She called on the governor not to erode the legacy of her late husband especially regarding All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA).</p>
      <p>She thanked former Governor Peter Obi for renaming the state University after Mr Ojukwu who was truly a hero in life and death.</p>
      <p>Mr Okeke said Mr Obiano was absent at the event due to other official engagements.</p>
      <p>“It is unfortunate that Obiano has not attended the memorial lecture since it started last year, but that is not to say that he will not attend.</p>
      <p>“The governor still has time in office and could still attend in future,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Muoghalu. whose lecture was titled: Ndigbo in the contemporary Nigerian politics, problems, prospects and way forward,” said the Igbo people must be given equal treatment like other tribes.</p>
      <p>Mr Muoghalu regretted that since the Nigeria/Biafra civil war, the effect had held the nation backward due to inability of the leaders to address the matters arising.</p>
      <p>“I suggest that key actors during the war like retired Gen. Yakubu Gowon should speak to heal the wounds to ensure lasting peace,” he said.</p>
      <p>Former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, who chaired the event called for restructuring of the country and introduction of state police.</p>
      <p>He said restructuring and de-centralisation of the police were key to addressing the mirage of problems plaguing the nation.</p>
