And following the biggest names in the category like Apple and Samsung comes the chinese giant Huawei with a new model of smartband.

And we have for you the new Huawei Band 4 on sale from Ebay and for a good measure we will throw in one deal for Bluedio Hi TWS earphones too.

All this can be yours in pink/orange/black from Ebay only for 29.90€.



Then we have for you the Bluedio Hi TWS wireless earphones featuring modern Bluetooth 5.0 connection, new Black technology with 13mm loudspeakers and moving coil for Hi-Fi quality audio, advanced coding, in-ear detection thanks to the built-in sensor chip, touch controls, integrated microphone, 55 mAh battery capacity for each of the earphones with 5-6 hours of working time, 600 mAh extra charging box and much more. Earphones are very light and in the box you will also find extra three pairs of replaceable ear tips. And the price ? Nothing major, just $12.30.
