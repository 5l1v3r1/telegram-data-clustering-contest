04 Nov 2019, 19:00 by Lewis Mckeever



Kelvin Gastelum is going to be making some big changes in 2020.
The former UFC interim middleweight title challenger received a huge wake up call in Saturday’s UFC 244 co-main event at Madison Square Garden, where Gastelum dropped a lackluster split decision to middleweight debutante Darren Till.

Gastelum issued a post-fight statement on social media, telling his fans to expect big changes to his training regimen in the new year.



“Sorry to everyone let down by my performance,” Gastelum posted in the early hours of Sunday morning. “Tonight I just couldn’t put it together! Love all of you anyway and I promise you that I will be back better. Only way to go is up! God bless you all.
“This is disappointing to say the least,” he said in the video (h/t MMA Fighting). “But I’m very positive I’m gonna come back next year and make some real changes, changes that will hopefully impact my performances from now on because this was... yeah. Thank you all for your support and I love all you guys, I leave my heart and soul out there for you guys. Thank you.”
Prior to UFC 244, Gastelum, the No. 4-ranked middleweight in the world, fought Israel Adesanya to a decision in a thrilling, Fight of the Night classic at UFC 236, and The Ultimate Fighter 17 winner is now 2-3 in his last five outings, with wins over Michael Bisping and Ronaldo Souza but losses to Till, Adesanya, and Chris Weidman.
