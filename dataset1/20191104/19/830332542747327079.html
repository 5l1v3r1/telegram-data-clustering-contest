      <p>MADISON, Wis. - An exposed 9-volt battery started a fire in a junk drawer Friday after it came in contact with a metal object, fire officials said.</p>
      <p>Firefighters responded to a call in the 4200 block of Jerome Street after the residents noticed smoke was coming from a kitchen drawer, according to a news release. When the homeowners opened the drawer, flames flared up. Officials said the homeowners took the drawer outside and dowsed it with snow to extinguish the fire.</p>
      <p>The damage was minimal thanks to the homeowners catching the fire so early, according to the release.</p>
      <p>Fire officials said the drawer contained a number of electrical items, including batteries that weren't held in any kind of packaging. According to the release, one of the homeowners put two chargers in the drawer roughly a half hour before the fire. Officials said the movement likely caused the 9-volt battery to come in contact with a metal object, resulting in a short that was hot enough to ignite other objects in the drawer.</p>
      <p>The Madison Fire Department warns people to keep batteries in their original packaging to avoid them coming in contact with objects that could pose a fire risk.</p>
