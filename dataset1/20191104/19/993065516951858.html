      <p>Viscountess Emma Weymouth said she cried all day after being eliminated from Strictly Come Dancing.</p>
      <p>The chef and her professional partner Aljaz Skorjanec were given the boot after losing out in the dance-off to BBC Breakfast’s Mike Bushell and his partner Katya Jones in Sunday’s results show.</p>
      <p>Appearing on spin-off It Takes Two, Weymouth said being on the BBC programme had been a “wonderful” experience.</p>

      <p>“I cried all day yesterday,” she said. Because doing Strictly has been so wonderful. I am so lucky to have been a part of it.</p>
      <p>“I’m just overwhelmed by how amazing it is to be part of the team. Everyone is so wonderful at Strictly.”</p>
      <p>Tearfully, she told host Rylan Clark-Neal that she and Skorjanec had “put our hearts” into the competition.</p>
      <p>Some fans of the show had suggested the judges were tough on Weymouth at the weekend, but she admitted her samba to Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber’s I Don’t Care had been a tricky dance.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know what to expect,” she said of the scoring, as she revealed her ribs were still sore from the challenging routine.</p>
      <p>Strictly Come Dancing continues on BBC One.</p>
