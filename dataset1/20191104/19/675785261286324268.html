      <p>A headstone that read 'RIP Barry Churckle 1944-2018' appeared at gay club Heaven on Saturday, with fans using it as a backdrop in selfies and posting them on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>

      <p>"I think it's totally disrespectful not only to me but to his wife, kids and grandchildren and all our families. They will be devastated by this.</p>
      <p>"I genuinely don't know what to say, what world do we now live in?"</p>

      <p>Paul recently told the Mirror that Barry regularly contacts him through dreams.</p>
      <p>He said: "He's been in so many of my dreams since he passed, and I believe in the afterlife â€“ it's comforting he's contacting me that way."</p>
      <p>Barry originally didn't tell his brother that he was suffering from cancer.</p>

      <p>Paul explained: "For a few years he had pain down one leg, but he said the doctors had told him it was nothing more than sciatica.</p>
      <p>"I went to pick him up to go and film a sketch, and his wife Ann was helping him out of the door.</p>
      <p>"He had a walking stick and looked 95 years old."</p>
      <p>When he couldn't get out of bed, Barry told him that it was bone cancer.</p>
