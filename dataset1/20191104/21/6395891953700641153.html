      <p><b>FARMINGTON, MaineÂ (AP)</b> - The condition of a building supervisor credited with getting people to safety before a deadly explosion in Maine has been upgraded from serious to fair.</p>
      <p>Larry Lord was seriously hurt weeks ago in a propane explosion at LEAP Inc. in Farmington. The Sun Journal reports his condition was upgraded Monday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.</p>
      <p>The explosion killed Farmington fire Capt. Michael Bell and injured six other firefighters seriously or critically. The firefighters have since been released from the hospital.</p>
      <p>Lord helped get almost a dozen people get out of the building and find safety before he called the fire department to report the smell of propane. The building exploded just minutes later.</p>
      <p>The cause of the leak and explosion at Leap Inc. are still under investigation.</p>
