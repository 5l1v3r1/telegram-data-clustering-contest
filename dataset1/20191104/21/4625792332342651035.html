      <h1>Woman found guilty after mailing white powder to Susan Collins following Kavanaugh vote</h1>

      <p>A jury in Maine found a woman <a href="https://wgme.com/news/local/maine-woman-found-guilty-of-sending-threatening-letter-to-susan-collins-home"><u>guilty</u></a> of sending threatening letters to Republican Maine Sen. Susan Collins after she voted to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh.</p>
      <p>Suzanne Muscara, 37, was found guilty of <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/woman-pleads-not-guilty-to-mailing-threat-to-susan-collins-over-kavanaugh-confirmation"><u>sending a threatening letter</u></a> to Collins’s home that was filled with white powder and a note that said, “AnthRAX!!! HA HA HA!!!”</p>
      <p>Muscara’s letter was intercepted by FBI agents who had been <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/authorities-respond-to-suspicious-letter-sent-to-susan-collins-home-in-maine"><u>screening Collins’s mail</u></a> after a letter sent the week prior had also contained a threatening substance.</p>
      <p>Muscara claimed she didn’t think anyone would read the letter and thought it was a harmless joke.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t want anything to happen,” she said when questioned by the FBI. “I just thought it was funny. I thought cops were, like, sifting through her mail. I didn’t expect anyone significant would read it.”</p>
      <p>Beyond the threatening note, Muscara had drawn a stick person with its tongue out and the letter ‘X’ for eyes. The letter was addressed to the senator’s current home with a prior home listed as the return address.</p>
      <p>She also denied that she knew who Collins was or that she had <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/susan-collins-sad-she-lost-supporters-over-kavanaugh-vote">made one of the deciding votes to confirm Kavanaugh</a> after his controversial nomination process.</p>
      <p>Muscara was identified as the culprit after her fingerprint was matched to the one on file after a 2013 arrest. The sender from the original letter is still unknown.</p>
      <p>Muscara has yet to be sentenced, but she faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.</p>
