      <p><b>NEW YORKÂ (AP)</b> - Uber picked up the pace of its revenue growth in the third quarter, but the ride-hailing heavyweight is still losing vast sums of money.</p>
      <p>The San Francisco company said Monday it racked up revenue of $3.81 billion in the third quarter, 30% more than the same time last year.</p>
      <p>But it lost $1.16 billion in the quarter, extending its streak of losses. The loss included $401 million in stock-based compensation related to its initial public offering.</p>
      <p>The loss amounted to 68 cents a share and was wider than the $986 million shortfall in the same period last year.</p>
      <p>The per share loss in the latest quarter, however, was smaller than what Wall Street had expected. Analysts were forecasting a loss of 82 cents a share, according to FactSet.</p>
      <p>Its revenue also topped expectations for $3.63 billion in the quarter.</p>
      <p>Uber convinced more people to use its array of products. The number of monthly active consumers across all its platforms grew to 103 million, up 26% from the same time last year.</p>
      <p>Last month, executives at Lyft said they expect the rival ride-hailing company to become profitable in the fourth quarter of 2021. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said Monday the company expects to be profitable for the full year 2021.</p>
      <p>Both Uber and Lyft are also facing potentially higher costs for paying drivers. In September, California passed a law requiring ride-hailing drivers to be classified as employees, which could entitle them to minimum wage, benefits and workers compensation. In response, Uber and Lyft proposed a ballot initiative aiming to exempt their companies from the new law.</p>
      <p>Some analysts are concerned that a deluge of Uber stock will flood the market later this week when a lockup period expires, allowing major shareholders, including company executives and investors, to sell their shares.</p>
      <p>Uber's stock price, closed Monday at $31.08, has lost nearly a third of its value since its initial public offering in May.</p>
      <p>The stock was down about 4% in after-hours trading following the earnings report.</p>
