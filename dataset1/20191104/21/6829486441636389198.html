      <h1>Tool Are Definitely About To Announce An Australian Tour</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T21:00:01+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>Yesterday, Frontier Touring dropped a video hinting at a surprise 2020 tour from a major American act. And uh, not to ruin the surprise or anything, but it’s definitely Tool.</p>
      <p>It’s not exactly what the video says that gives it away, but rather how it says it. See, the thing’s extremely simple: a series of Australian cities flash up over a black background, the words slowly distorting. In most cases, it’d barely appear like a clue at all.</p>
      <p>But then there’s the question of font. There’s no mistaking the lettering style of those Aussie place names: it’s the same one that appears on the front cover of <a href="https://junkee.com/tool-review/220172">the new Tool record, <i>Fear Inoculum</i></a>. I mean like — exactly the same.</p>

      <p>Maynard Keenan and his band of prog-rock influenced metalheads are no strangers to these shores, having toured the country a number of times during their heyday. Hell, Keenan is such a fan of Australia that he’s even brought Puscifier out here, playing <a href="https://www.moshcam.com/articles/48251/puscifer">a particularly bizarre live show stylised after a Mexican luchador bout.</a></p>
      <p>There’s no indication of when this Tool tour will be formally announced quite yet, but given that fans around the country have already blown this one wide open, expect Frontier Touring to drop the full details on the thing within a week or two.</p>
