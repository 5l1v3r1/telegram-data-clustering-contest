      <p>The recall comes after notification by the Food and Drug Administration and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency of potential listeria, the FDA said in a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/mann-packing-co-inc-voluntarily-recalls-vegetable-products-sold-united-states-and-canada-due">news release</a>. The FDA said there have been no reports of any illnesses associated with the vegetable products.</p>
      <p>The recalled vegetable products are labeled "Best If Enjoyed By" Oct. 11, 2019, to Nov. 16, 2019, the FDA said in its <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/mann-packing-co-inc-voluntarily-recalls-vegetable-products-sold-united-states-and-canada-due">release</a>.</p>
      <p>Products include vegetables sold by Mann under the brand names Del Monte, HEB, Hungryroot, Kroger Organic, Mann's, Marketside, O Organics, Signature Farms, Sysco and Trader Joe's, according to Mann Packing's <a href="https://mannpackingproductlist11-2019.us/">website</a>.</p>
      <p>The full list of U.S. products can be found <a href="https://mannpackingproductlist11-2019.us/">here</a>, the list of Canadian products can be found <a href="https://mannpackingproductlist11-2019.ca/">here</a>.</p>
      <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/index.html">website</a>, listeria is caused by Listeria monocytogenes bacterium and is usually contracted from contaminated food.  An estimated 1,600 people get listeriosis each year, and about 260 people die, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/index.html">CDC</a> said. The infection is most likely to sicken pregnant women and their newborns, adults aged 65 or older, and people with weakened immune systems, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/index.html">CDC</a> said.</p>
