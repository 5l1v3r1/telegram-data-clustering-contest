      <h1>The Witcher showrunner already has seven seasons mapped out</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T21:00:27+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/anchalk/" target="_blank">Andy Chalk</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/netflix-witcher-series/">The Witcher</a> series on Netflix is still more than a month away, so obviously we can't say yet whether it will be any good—or, maybe more accurately, whether it will be a hit with people looking to fill the low-fantasy-shaped holes in their lives. The good news is that if it is, there's lots more to come, as showrunner Lauren Hissrich told SFX magazine (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/witcher-netflix-season-7-lauren-schmidt-hissrich-interview/?utm_content=buffere1890&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer_sfxtw">GamesRadar</a>) that she's already mapped out stories for seven seasons.</p>
      <p>"We don’t have a second season yet—God willing we will—but right now it’s just about, ‘How do you set up stories that really capture audiences for years at a time?’" Hissrich said. "The worst thing we could do is put all of our energies just into season one, and not be thinking about where these characters can grow to.” </p>
      <p>She also gently warned viewers not to get too attached to anyone, because "not all" of them will survive the first season: "I can't promise you that they're very much alive," she said.</p>
      <p>It could be that I'm reading too much into it, but both of these points seem intended to draw a line between The Witcher and Game of Thrones—fans of which would presumably be a natural fit for Henry's Big Adventures—while implicitly promising a more satisfying conclusion for viewers. </p>
      <p>Game of Thrones famously stomped on every rake in town on its way out the door, but it was also in the very weird position of being at least a couple of novels ahead of the books it was based on. That should be less of a problem for The Witcher, which has six novels, two short story collections, and the games (and possibly more, but that's what pops quickly out of Google) to work with.</p>
      <p>First things first, though: Season one needs to be good. It begins on December 20, and will look something like this:</p>
