      <h1>Premier League to discuss 'radical' VAR changes - including appeals for managers</h1>
      <h2>VAR has again been in the headlines this week after a series of high-profile decisions, that appeared to be incorrect</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T21:20:06+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 21:20</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Premier League managers could be allowed to appeal a refereeing decision during a match amid a number of potential VAR changes.</p>
      <p>A series of high-profile incidents have led to huge criticism of VAR after just a third of the season.</p>
      <p>Everton's draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> could well prove to be the watershed moment with a number of decisions not given despite lengthy delays.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> were also incorrectly denied a goal for Roberto Firmino by VAR in their win at Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>Premier League clubs will meet next week with a "robust" discussion promised on the current failings of VAR, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/04/premier-league-debate-radical-changes-var-including-giving-managers/">reports the Telegraph.</a></p>
      <p>And among the possible 'radical' changes could be the introduction of a set number of appeals for managers, as in other sports.</p>

      <p>It is believed the Premier League will strongly argue against the proposal but the increased scrutiny on VAR will continue.</p>
      <p>There have been calls for the technology to be scrapped but there is not expected to be a vote on the suspension, instead a change in the guidelines.</p>
      <p>No top-flight official has so far checked pitchside monitors after advice to use them "sparingly" in pre-season.</p>
      <p>That could well change upon the next meeting of Premier League clubs, where bosses will be asked what other adaptations they would like to see.</p>
