      <p>A star of The Chase left fans shocked tonight - by issuing a brutal assessment of his choice of clothing.</p>
      <p>Paul Sinha, also known as the Sinnerman, is one of five Chasers rolled out by the ITV1 daytime favourite.</p>
      <p>The Chase, presented by Bradley Walsh, sees Sinha - or his co-stars Mark Labbett, aka the Beast, Shaun 'Dark Destroyer' Wallace, Anne 'The Governess' Hegerty or Jenny Ryan, aka the Vixen - go up against a team of four contestants.</p>
      <p>Tonight, Paul clashed with somebody on the show looking to land a life-changing sum - and he left social media users all commenting on his brutal words.</p>

      <p>Paul, 49, was up against Tim, who presenter Bradley welcomed onto the show.</p>
      <p>Tim, 58, from Cheshire, was being spoken to by former Coronation Street star Brad when Paul interjected: "I am just a little bit distracted, because with a quizzers brain, I am just ranking the ten worst shirts I have seen in my life and you are in at number seven."</p>

      <p>Tim said: "Can I just say, my shirt at number seven, I thought that was an insult, I should be at number one."</p>
      <p>The Sinnerman hit back, though, saying: "Obviously, you haven't seen as many bad shirts as I have over the years."</p>
      <p>But Bradley Walsh wasn't having it, and rushed to Tim's defence, saying: "Some of them belonging to me, no doubt."</p>
