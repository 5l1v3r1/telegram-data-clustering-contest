NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) - Emergency crews are responding to a small plane crash in a Massachusetts cemetery.
The New Bedford firefighters union said on its Instagram account Monday afternoon that crews were on the scene of a crash at Rural Cemetery near the Rhode Island state line.
It's not clear what caused the plane to crash and if anyone was injured. No further information was posted.
A Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said the agency would provide more information when it receives it.
The cemetery, which dates to the 1800s, is about 5 miles south of the New Bedford Regional Airport, which serves southern Massachusetts.
