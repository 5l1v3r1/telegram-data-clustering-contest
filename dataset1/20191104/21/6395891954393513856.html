      <h1>Indians let All-Star pitcher Salazar &amp; 3 others go free</h1>

      <p><b>CLEVELANDÂ (AP)</b> - The Indians have given up on former All-Star Danny Salazar, whose career has been sidetracked by injuries.</p>
      <p>Salazar was reinstated from the 60-day disabled list Monday and refused an outright assignment to Triple-A Columbus, electing to become a free agent.</p>
      <p>Relievers Tyler Olson, A.J. Cole and starter Cody Anderson also were reinstated and went free after refusing outright assignments.</p>
      <p>Salazar made the AL All-Star team in 2016 before shoulder problems set him back. The right-hander did not pitch at all in 2018 following surgery, but worked his way up and pitched four innings against Houston on Aug. 1.</p>
      <p>However, he later revealed he had hurt his groin before the appearance and later asked the team for more time away</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old went 38-33 in 104 starts for Cleveland.</p>
      <p>Olson struggled this season after being a solid lefty for manager Terry Francona. He went 1-1 with a 4.40 ERA in 39 games.</p>
      <p>Cole made the Indians' roster in training camp. He finished 3-1 with a 3.81 ERA and one save in 25 games.</p>
