04 Nov 2019, 21:30 by Jordan Crucchiola
You’ve eaten. You’ve prayed. You’ve loved. Now you can see City of Girls as a movie. The novel by author Elizabeth Gilbert has been optioned by producer Sue Kroll, and Emmy winner Michelle Ashford will adapt the script. The plot is a classic woman-becomes-herself setup, but make it old-timey in New York. “Set in 1940’s NYC, in the sparkling world of dazzling artistes, glamorous showgirls, and oversized theater personalities, City of Girls is an exploration of a young woman’s journey to discovering herself.” In addition to self-discovery there will be “love, sex,” and also “friendship.” Sounds like the essentials are covered!
