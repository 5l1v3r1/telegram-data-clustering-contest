'Nauseating PC-crazed tripe': Piers Morgan blasts John Legend for changing 'sexy' lyrics of Baby It’s Cold Outside
04 Nov 2019, 21:28 by John Gage
Piers Morgan called John Legend hypocritical after the songwriter announced plans to release a Christmas album that has a version of the song Baby It's Cold Outside with politically correct lyrics.
The 54-year-old Morgan wrote a column Monday for the Daily Mail defending the original lyrics, saying, ""There's nothing sleazy about it, or nasty, or even remotely 'problematic' to quote the ghastly buzzword of modern day political correctness.""
""It's fun, sexy, playful, and both the man and woman are completely in control of their own actions during the mutually enjoyable and totally consensual experience,"" the former CNN host said.
Legends version of the song, which he performs with Kelly Clarkson, censors lyrics such as, ""Say, what's in this drink?” and “No cabs to be had out there,” with ""If I have one more drink?"" and ""It's your body, and your choice.""
Morgan called the new lyrics ""a load of nauseating PC-crazed tripe."" He also pointed out that Legend is friends with Snoop Dogg, Eminem, and Pharrell Williams, all of whom have all written worse lyrics.
""Legend's targeted 'Baby It's Cold Outside' because it's an easy win for him — something guaranteed to get him lots of publicity and make women go 'awwwww, isn't he lovely?'"" he said. ""Yet when it comes to the often disturbingly hateful women-shaming lyrics of so many of his contemporaries, gutless Legend remains silent.""
Legend, 40, and his wife, Chrissy Teigen, are on the cover of the December edition of Vanity Fair, where some of the lyrics from his new album were published. The songwriter announced in the issue that he and Teigen are supporting Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren for president and were confused why other people were not backing a woman president.
