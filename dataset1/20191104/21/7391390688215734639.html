      <p>If you thought you'd have your fill of candy post-Halloween, just wait. More chocolate is coming, but maybe not in the form you thought. The new <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/71064-forever-21s-target-demographic-is-literally-everyone-and-it-seems-to-be-working-for-them">Forever 21 x Hershey collection</a> is coming but unlike all the discount Halloween candy you may have bought, this won't give you cavities.</p>
      <p>The affordable clothing brand has teamed up with iconic candy company Hersey to create a collection of pieces inspired by the well-known food company's most popular treats. From Reese's to York Peppermint Patties, there's a little bit of sweetness whether you're a chocolate lover or can't get enough of that sour apple flavor of a green Jolly Rancher.</p>
      <p>The collection features a variety of pieces including pullover hoodies, Fair Isle-inspired Hersey print pajamas, and onesies. However, the sweet-themed products don't end with clothing. There's also Kisses-shaped pillows and a hooded Reese's throw blanket that's also up for grabs.</p>
      <p>If you do decide that you need just a bit more candy in your life between Halloween and the official start of the holiday season, prices range from just $12.99-$39.99. Sizes for the clothing begin at an XS and extend to an XL. The best part, though? All of the <a href="https://www.forever21.com/us/shop/catalog/category/f21/promo-hershey-collection">Forever 21 x Hershey's collection</a> is available now on the Forever 21 website.</p>

      <p>Sure, that stack of left-over Halloween candy may still be staring at you. Yes, it's not even Thanksgiving yet. But what better way to get in the holiday spirit than a pair of Santa hat and Hersey Kiss covered pajamas? According to Forever 21 x Hersey, there's not one.</p>
