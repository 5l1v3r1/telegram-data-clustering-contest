Ousmane Dembele was mysteriously absent at the weekend but he has been called up by Ernesto Valverde for the Champions League clash with Slavia Prague on Tuesday. The coach wanted to dispel doubts about the forward and he may start at Camp Nou.
Beyond the strange case of Dembele, Arthur Melo has been left out of the squad this time around, along with Junior Firpo, Wague and Jean-Clair Todibo. However Samuel Umtiti has been given his medical clearance and is in the squad.
Sergi Roberto and Jordi Alba are in despite recent problems, while Luis Suarez is missing because of a calf problem.
The squad list is: Ter Stegen, Semedo, Piqué, Rakitic, Busquets, Messi, Dembélé, Neto, Lenglet, Griezmann, Alba, Aleñá, Sergi Roberto, De Jong, Vidal, Umtiti, Carles Pérez, Ansu Fati.
