      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Varun-Dhawan">Varun Dhawan</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sara-Ali-Khan">Sara Ali Khan</a> will be sharing screen space for the first time in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/David-Dhawan">David Dhawan</a>'s 'Coolie No. 1' and it seems like the audience have already started liking the new onscreen pair. The duo often gets snapped in the characters on the sets of the film. Pictures and videos of the same are all over the internet.</p>
      <p>On Monday night, Varun and Sara were clicked as they stepped for a meeting in the city. For the occasion, Varun was in an all-black look while Sara looked pretty in a white salwar suit. They were all smiles as <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/paparazzi">paparazzi</a> captured them on cameras.</p>
