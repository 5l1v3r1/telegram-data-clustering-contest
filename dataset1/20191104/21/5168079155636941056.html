      <p><b>Muscat:</b> In line with the efforts to promote integrated logistics services, an agreement for the development of a truck rest area with a total investment of OMR2.5 million over an area of 50,000 square metres was signed on Monday at Sohar Port and Freezone.<br/><br/>Initiated by the Ministry of Transport and spearheaded by Asyad, the truck rest area will assist in promoting road safety after the significant increase in the number of trucks at the port.<br/><br/>The area will offer an added value to the logistics infrastructure of the port and freezone to all its tenants from various road transport companies, through the provision of a dedicated area for truck drivers to take breaks during long journeys.<br/><br/>Apart from streamlining logistics at the port, it will also aid in saving transit time between destinations and reducing road congestion by preventing drivers from parking at the sides of the road and in residential areas.</p>
      <p>The importance of this project is also demonstrated by its role of unifying operators and tenants of both the port and freezone.<br/><br/>Sohar Port and Freezone celebrated its 15th anniversary in a glittering ceremony at the Kempinski Hotel Muscat, on Monday. The event was conducted under the auspices of Dr Ahmed Mohammed Al Futaisi, Minister of Transport, alongside the presence of distinguished excellencies, ministers, dignitaries, partners and members of the port management.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“15 years since the inception of Sohar port and freezone, we are proud to have established a world-class port on the coasts of Oman to serve the region and the world. The port has become a pivotal part of the logistics sector in the Sultanate and a major import and export hub for both Oman and the regional countries,” Al Futaisi said.<br/><br/>“The port itself is a success story, with regard to several aspects. This especially includes its achievement of attracting large vessels and international investors, accommodating a variety of industries and handling a diverse range and size of general cargos, containers and other goods,” he added.<br/><br/>“The port has created a remarkable footprint and made its presence recognised, both in the region and globally. We are also proud to be ranked as one of the fastest-growing port and free zones in the world, with investments exceeding OMR10 billion,” Dr Mohammed Nasser Al Zaabi, Chairman of the Board of Sohar Port and Freezone said.<br/><br/>“With our strategic geographical location, providing us access to global markets with an outreach of over 2 billion people, Sohar Port has played a vital role in line with the national Logistics Strategy 2040.<br/><br/>The strategy aims to place the transport sector as the second-highest source of national income alongside putting the Sultanate among the top ten countries for logistics performance by the year 2040,” he added.<br/><br/><b>Vital statistics</b><br/><br/>Employees of the freezone paid tribute to the past and future of the port by narrating their personal memories. Additionally, a video highlighting the notable achievements of the company over the course of 15 years, comprising of invaluable insights from significant spokespeople, was revealed. The event concluded with the presentation of the first copy of the 15th Anniversary Sohar Port and Freezone book to the chief guest.<br/><br/>In addition to celebrating the people and achievements, the book also highlighted key statistics about its contribution to Oman over the last 15 years. The throughput grew year on year reaching 61 million tonnes and the port now handles over 3,400 vessels per year.<br/><br/>Nearly 62 per cent of Oman’s total imports entered through the port and freezone in 2017, alongside 42 per cent of the country’s exported volumes. In the same year, it also contributed to 4.8 per cent of Oman’s total gross domestic product (GDP).<br/><br/>The Port and Freezone is also a trailblazer for job creation and has created 10,836 direct job opportunities, with the combined value for both direct and indirect employment amounting to 1.1 per cent of the total number of workers in Oman, which has generated a combined added value of 1.3 billion in 2018.<br/><br/>“Sohar Port and Freezone has always aimed to expand and reach out to important markets and reinforce relationships with investors from across the globe.
