      <p>HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, Fla. â€” A grandmother in Hillsborough County, Florida, is facing several charges after she caused a crash that killed her 10-month-old granddaughter, according to Florida Highway Patrol.</p>
      <p>According to an accident report, Helen Mention, 50, was drunk when she crashed into a guardrail on Friday, Oct. 25 at 9 a.m. Her blood alcohol level was .225, FHP says. That's nearly three times the legal limit of 0.08.</p>
      <p>Troopers say Mention was driving with 10-month-old Harlem Mention on her lap. She was turning from Mango Road onto westbound I-4 when she crashed into a guardrail.</p>
      <p>Harlem was taken to Tampa General with critical injuries. She died a few days later on Oct. 28, according to FHP.</p>
      <p>Mention was arrested Monday and charged with DUI manslaughter, aggravated manslaughter of a child, careless driving and a violation of Florida's child restraint law.</p>
