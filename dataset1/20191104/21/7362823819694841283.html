      <p>In a new episode of <a href="https://nation.foxnews.com/quiz-show/clips/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=article::add=QuizShow_Article_FNC_Platform">Fox Nation's "Quiz Show,"</a> Democratic strategist and radio personality Richard Fowler joined host Tom Shillue to test his knowledge on off the wall TV and film-themed trivia.</p>
      <p>The topic: "Things that are fragrant, and triangles," explained Shillue.</p>

      <p>Shillue quizzed Fowler on famous films including "Scooby-Doo," and "Monster Island," managing to sneak some music references as well.</p>
      <p>Fowler performed considerably well, but he scored incorrectly on many of the tv-related questions.</p>

      <p>"There is a light at the end of the tunnel," said Shillue, "and I want you to get this last one. Gloria Gaynor said it, 'I Will Survive," and you will survive, no matter what happens," Shillue joked.</p>
      <p>Fowler was just the latest in a long line of Fox News personalities who have taken the quiz. All the episodes are available on-demand on the Fox Nation app.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/g/matt-gaetz">Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., </a>also joined Shillue in what he called a "VIP" episode where he tested his knowledge of romantic pairings - some of which never happened.</p>

      <p>Gaetz performed surprisingly well and credited his days as a college student for preparing him for the difficult questions.</p>
      <p>In another episode, Shillue tried to stump actress<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kristy-swanson-says-liberals-calling-trump-racist-have-attacked-the-color-of-his-skin"> Kristy Swanson</a> as he tested her knowledge about popular romantic comedies throughout the years.</p>

      <p>The Hollywood actress was asked about details from many of the most famous rom-coms --  and even stumped Shillue at one point during the game.</p>
