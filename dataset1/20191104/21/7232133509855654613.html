      <h1>Bitcoin May Soon Make a Big Movement That Favors Bulls</h1>

      <p>After facing some downwards pressure yesterday, Bitcoin (BTC) has been able to incur some upwards momentum that has allowed it to climb back to $9,300, which marks a slight climb from its daily lows of $9,150.</p>
      <p>Analysts are now noting that Bitcoin is currently caught within a wide descending channel over a long-time frame, but a bullish formation that it is currently caught within on a lower-time frame may mean that a visit to the upper boundary of this channel is imminent.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Climbs Slightly as Analysts Anticipate Imminent Big Movement</h3>
      <p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/05/key-indicator-signals-that-year-end-could-be-a-positive-time-for-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> trading up roughly 1% at its <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">current price</a> of $9,300, which is the highest point that it has been trading at over the past 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin’s short-term bullishness came about after the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/large-bitcoin-player-manipulated-price-sharply-higher-study-says-11572863400">crypto</a> briefly visited $9,150 yesterday, which appears to be a near-term level of support that could bolster the cryptocurrency’s price action in the near-term.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that the past few weeks have marked a consolidation period for the cryptocurrency, which has been ranging between $9,000 and $9,500 ever since it incurred its meteoric rally to $9,500.</p>
      <p>Big Chonis, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, explained in a recent tweet that a technical formation may signal that a big price movement is imminent.</p>
      <blockquote>“Current ‘Heikin Ashi’ with a very tight ‘doji’ body after a small green candle, ‘reversal signal? BIG move setup, after sideways down all week just like the volume,” he explained while pointing to the chart seen below.</blockquote>

      <h3>BTC Caught in Wide Descending Channel</h3>
      <p>It is also important to note that <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/23/bitcoin-crashes-to-7400-as-crypto-markets-falter/">Bitcoin</a> is currently caught within a wide descending channel, which could mean that it is gearing up for a big movement to either the upper or lower boundary of the channel that it is currently trading within.</p>
      <p>Jonny Moe, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, spoke about this channel in a recent tweet, pointing to a chart that shows its upper-boundary around $9,900, and also showing that <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-outshines-gold-for-first-time-since-june">BTC</a> is caught in a bull flag that could help propel it higher in the near-term.</p>
      <blockquote>“Tweaked a little as we’ve gone along, but still watching, waiting. $BTC,” he said while pointing to the below chart.</blockquote>

      <p>The range that <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/03/13/bitcoin-short-positions-rise-as-btc-faces-growing-resistance-at-critical-4000-level/">Bitcoin</a> is currently trading within should be closely watched by trader and analysts alike, as its response to the upper-boundary at $9,900 could provide significant insight into where the crypto is heading next.</p>
