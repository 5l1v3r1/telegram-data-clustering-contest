      <p>Sometimes an actor takes a role because it’s too good of an idea to pass up, while in other cases the change of pace is what determines someone like actor Alexander Skarsgård taking a role in a film like <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/Godzilla-Kong-67757.html">director Adam Wingard’s <i>Godzilla vs. Kong</i></a>. That very scenario is what lead to the actor taking part in the latest Monster-Verse entry, set to debut early next year.</p>
      <p>Alexander Skarsgård admitted as much during a recent interview, as he explained his choice thusly:</p>
      <blockquote>I’d done a row of darker, very intense subject matters and darker roles, like <i>The Kill Team</i>, <i>The Aftermath</i>, <i>The Little Drummer Girl</i>, a limited series that I did about the conflict in the Middle East, <i>Hold the Dark</i>, which was a Netflix movie that was also very, very dark, and <i>Big Little Lies</i>, which was about abuse. So, there was a row of extraordinarily interesting projects and subject matters, but I was also ready to play a character with a bit more levity and have a bit more fun in something that was not as dark and intense.</blockquote>
      <p>Bleaker roles have been a bit of a specialty for Alexander Skarsgård, and that pattern certainly isn’t going to let up any time soon. Skarsgård proved this to be true when he recently accepted <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2479525/true-bloods-alexander-skarsgard-will-go-supernatural-again-for-stephen-kings-the-stand-tv-show">the role of Randall Flagg</a>, the legendary villain at the heart of CBS All Access’ limited series adaptation of Stephen King’s <i>The Stand</i>. But even with his villainous credentials continuing to present themselves in his work, Alexander Skarsgård has still given himself some <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471245/what-happened-when-alexander-skarsgard-shaved-half-his-head-for-a-movie-role">more room to let loose</a> in pre-<i>Godzilla vs. Kong</i> roles.</p>
      <p>This summer’s romantic comedy <i>Long Shot</i> saw the former <i>True Blood</i> actor playing a very fictional equivalent of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which is most certainly different from the roles that he mentioned to <a href="https://collider.com/alexander-skarsgard-the-kill-team-the-stand-godzilla-vs-kong-interview/">Collider</a> above. So just how did <i>Godzilla vs. Kong</i> manage to land Alexander Skarsgård? That too was explained in this interview, as the actor laid out the path to this credit as follows:</p>
      <blockquote>I’d met Adam Wingard, the director of <i>Godzilla vs. Kong</i>, before, and I really liked him. And the guys at Legendary – Alex Garcia, Jay Ashenfelter and Mary Parent – are just awesome people and really good collaborators, if you’re gonna do a big action movie. It was a fun character to play. He’s a good guy and a likable guy, which I was quite ready to play after row of dark characters, but he’s also not boring.</blockquote>
      <p>This change of pace sounds like a good fit for Alexander Skarsgård, but it sounds even better for <i>Godzilla vs. Kong</i>, as his inclusion may be refreshing enough to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478269/was-godzilla-king-of-the-monsters-a-victim-of-monster-movie-fatigue">boost the box office chances</a> of the next film in Warner Bros’ Monster-Verse. We’ll see soon enough as <i>Godzilla vs. Kong</i> marches into theaters forcefully <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480313/new-movie-releases-2020-movie-release-date-schedule">on March 13, 2020</a>; provided <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2474860/could-godzilla-vs-kong-end-up-delayed">it sticks with its original release date</a> on the 2020 release schedule.</p>
      <p>But if you want to see more Alexander Skarsgård without that long of a wait, his latest film, <i>The Kill Team</i> is in theaters and on VOD now.</p>
