      <p>Sprint, the fourth largest wireless carrier by subscribers, has been aggressive in its 5G push, offering the faster mobile technology in nine cities and bundling it with media content like Hulu and Amazom.com Inc's Prime.</p>
      <p>The company, which has been struggling to close its US$26 billion-merger with T-Mobile due to legal hurdles, said total net operating revenue fell to US$7.8 billion from US$8.43 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of US$8.17 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Net loss attributable to the company was US$274 million, or 7 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a net income of US$196 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Analysts were expecting a loss of 2 cents per share.</p>
      <p>Shares of the company were up nearly 2per cent at US$6.40 in trading before the bell.</p>
