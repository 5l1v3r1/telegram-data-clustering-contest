      <p>If you've just marathoned your way through the <i><a href="https://www.popbuzz.com/tv-film/the-end-of-the-fucking-world/season-3-not-happening/">The End of the F***ing World</a>'</i>s eight-episode second season, you'll be disappointed to learn James and Alyssa's unconventional love story has likely reached its end. Series creator Charlie Covell told the <i>Radio Times </i>in a recent interview that she's satisfied with where the show leaves things, and likely won't <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2019-10-28/the-end-of-the-fing-world-season-3/">bring it back for Season 3</a>.</p>
      <p>"I think, for me, that's it now. Yeah, that's done," Covell said when asked if the show would continue. "I think to try and eke more out would be wrong, I like where we've left it."</p>
      <p>That the show even had a second season was significant in and of itself. Though the first season was near-universally lauded, many viewers felt its ambiguous cliffhanger ending — in which James (Alex Lawther) was seemingly shot after being cornered by the police — was the perfect place to end things. "<i><a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a847356/end-of-the-fucking-world-season-two-shouldnt-happen-netflix-channel-4/">The End of the F***ing World</a></i> is too good to deserve Season 2," read one Digital Spy headline.</p>
      <p>The show is also based on Charles Forsman's mini-comics series of the same name, and Season 1 concluded in the same (albeit slightly different) place as its source material. That means Season 2 is an entirely new storyline written by Covell, who apparently thinks she's taken it as far as it can go.</p>

      <p>That being said, it's possible an idea will spark and she'll change her mind down the line, like<a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/08/08/fleabag-season-2-phoebe-waller-bridge-reason/"> Phoebe Waller-Bridge did with <i>Fleabag</i></a><i>.</i> If so, it will still be quite some time until <i>The End of the F***ing World</i> comes back, or until a third season announcement is made one way or the other. The show premiered in October 2017 and wasn't <a href="https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/the-end-of-the-fing-world-netflix-renew-second-season-channel-4-1202911456/">renewed for a second season</a> until almost a year later, in August 2018. It then took another 15 months until it was released. So a potential Season 3 could be as long as two years away, if not more.</p>
      <p>For now, it sounds like Covell's mind is made up. "Put it this way, if for some reason we hadn't been allowed to do season two, I would have been really gutted. Which I think shows that it was the right thing to do – for me, anyway," she continued to Radio Times. "I think I like where we end it [in season two], and yeah, it feels right for the story."</p>
      <p>Though, as she added, "you never know."</p>
