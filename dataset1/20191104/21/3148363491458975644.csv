Mark Cuban Calls for Government-Mandated Fact-Checks of News Opinion
Mark Cuban has an idea of how to lower the level of partisanship in the country today: Have the government make a law mandating fact-checks on news opinion.

The billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks and star of ABC’s hit show Shark Tank, tweeted about the sweeping and likely unconstitutional changes he would like to see  on Sunday night.



When asked who would do the fact-checking, Cuban said other journalists should do it:



What Cuban is describing here is weaponizing the mainstream media establishment against conservative media. One would imagine it would take the hypothetical “journalist monitors” about eight minutes before they ruled that Fox News’ entire prime time lineup was in flagrant violation of the “opinion mandate.” Thus leading to the entirely predictable scenario where the peer review journalists rule that the only way Fox can stay in business is if they re-hire Shepard Smith, and let him anchor all prime time hours.
The fun the left would have with this new rule would then result in companion legislation stretching to blogs and websites, where other conservative or right-leaning publications would suffer a similar fate.
Still, despite the absurdity of Cuban’s proposal, it’s probably only a matter of time before a major 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful picks up the idea and runs with it.
