Отрывок из одной из лучших концертных программ Гэбриэля от 2017. Настоящее искусство, где продуманы нюансы и есть место вдохновению.Looking down on empty streets, all she can seeAre the dreams all made solidAre the dreams all made realAll of the buildings, all of those carsWere once just a dreamIn somebody's headShe pictures the broken glass, she pictures the steamShe pictures a soulWith no leak at the seamLets take the boat outWait until darknessLet's take the boat outWait until darkness comesNowhere in the corridors of pale green and greyNowhere in the suburbsIn the cold light of dayThere in the midst of it so alive and aloneWords support like boneDreaming of mercy st.Wear your inside outDreaming of mercyIn your daddy('s arms againDreaming of mercy st.'Swear they moved that signDreaming of mercyIn your daddy's armsPulling out the papers from the drawers that slide smoothTugging at the darkness, word upon wordConfessing all the secret things in the warm velvet boxTo the priest–he's the doctorHe can handle the shocksDreaming of the tenderness–the tremble in the hipsOf kissing Mary's lipsDreaming of mercy st.Wear your insides outDreaming of mercyIn your daddy's arms againDreaming of mercy st.'Swear they moved that signLooking for mercyIn your daddy's armsMercy, mercy, looking for mercyMercy, mercy, looking for mercyAnne, with her father is out in the boatRiding the waterRiding the waves on the sea
