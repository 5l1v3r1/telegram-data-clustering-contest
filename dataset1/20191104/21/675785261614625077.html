      <h2>Liverpool have put in some below-par performances in recent weeks - and Arsenal legend Charlie Nicholas believes Mohamed Salah should pay the price</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T21:30:41+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has been urged to drop Mohamed Salah by Sky Sports pundit Charlie Nicholas.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> star branded the Egyptian's performance against Aston Villa on Sunday "really average" as the Reds needed two late goals to snatch a 2-1 win.</p>
      <p>Klopp's side take on Genk in the Champions League on Tuesday night before turning their attentions to a huge clash with title rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> next weekend.</p>
      <p>And Nicholas reckons Klopp should consider removing Salah from the starting line-up as he also expressed concerns over the performances of Roberto Firmino after some "reality checks" already this season.</p>

      <p>"I watched the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> game at the weekend. It was a cracking game and end-to-end with drama too," Nicholas told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"Liverpool are not at their best. People might suggest that once they get going, they will be ruthless, but they are getting away with it currently.</p>
      <p>"The Napoli and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> matches were reality checks, but they could have been two or three down by the time they rescued things at Aston Villa.</p>

      <p>"Liverpool have a huge amount of games coming up. Mohamed Salah was really average at the weekend, as was Roberto Firmino, so Jurgen Klopp may leave a couple out and change it up.</p>
      <p>"The full-backs will stay the same and you have to leave Sadio Mane in, but Fabinho could also come back in.</p>
      <p>"It is normally Firmino who he rests, but I would leave him in with Mane and leave Salah out. He may not like it but it needs to happen.</p>
      <p>"Divock Origi and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will come in and I think it will be a fairly comfortable night nevertheless for Liverpool."</p>
