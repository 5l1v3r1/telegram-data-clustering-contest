What you need to know

Marriott has launched a new 100K bonus limited time offer
The Marriott Bonvoy Business™ American Express® Card and Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Credit Card are eligible
The bonus is worth about $800 according to The Points Guy

Update: This offer is set to end on Wednesday, November 6. Be sure to get your application in before so you don't miss out on this great reward.
When Marriott acquired SPG hotels and brought their rewards program under the Bonvoy program, it had offered new cardholders of its Marriott Bonvoy Business™ American Express® Card and Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Credit Card a limited time 100K points bonus. For anyone who missed that offer and has held out in hopes of its return, Marriott is back. For a limited time, again, you can earn $100,000 in Marriott Bonvoy points with either card if you spend $5000 in the first the 3 months of card ownership. The Points Guy values Marriott Bonvoy points at around $0.80, so this offer equates to about $800 in hotel stays, a solid offer for anyone looking to visit one of Marriott's hotels anytime soon.
For anyone looking to earn this bonus and want a personal card, the Marriott Bonvoy Boundless™ Credit Card is eligible for this offer. This card is great for those who tend to stay at Marriott's 7,000 hotels around the world on personal trips, as the card offers 6X Bonvoy points for each booking. Cardholders also enjoy a Free Night Award every year and Automatic Silver Elite Status to get extra perks during your stay.

If you are looking for a business card, the Marriott Bonvoy Business™ American Express® Card is eligible for this 100K offer. Its annual fee of $125 is quickly justified after that welcome bonus and its stellar rewards and benefits. It goes further with rewards than its consumer-focused counterpart, also offering points on restaurant, gas station, and phone service purchases. Those who spend over $60,000 on the card every year can also earn an additional Free Night Award from Marriott.
