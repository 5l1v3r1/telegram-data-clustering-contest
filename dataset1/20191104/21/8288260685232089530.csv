The Chase presenter Bradley Walsh was left with a red-face this weekend - after a ""rude"" question surfaced.
Bradley, a former Coronation Street star himself, welcomed current Corrie badboy Mikey North onto the ITV1 show.
The celebrity instalment of the popular ITV1 daytime favourite aired on Saturday evening (November 2).

Mikey appeared on the programme with The Saturdays singer Una Healy, This Morning presenter Alison Hammond and boxer Carl Froch.
The question read: ""In what form of gambling might you be tempted to hold your plums?""
Bradley couldn’t even finish reading it out before creasing over with laughter, along with the audience and contestants.
 
The answers available to Mikey were ‘slot machine’, ‘backgammon’ and ‘spread betting’ - the latter Bradley had another giggle over.
Mikey went for ‘slot machine’, joking: ""When your plums come up in front of you Bradley, you've got to hold them.""
The cobbles villain had only just arrived at the board with Anne ‘The Governess’ Hegerty eagerly waiting when Bradders had a fit of the giggles.

The Chase airs weekdays at 5pm on ITV.
