      <h1>Philippe Coutinho sends three word message to Liverpool striker</h1>
      <h2>Philippe Coutinho responded to a post from Roberto Firmino after Liverpool's win at Crystal Palace</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:47:36+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/paul-clarke/" target="_blank">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Former Liverpool star Philippe Coutinho has taken to Instagram to issue a kind message to ex-team-mate Roberto Firmino.</p>
      <p>The duo played alongside each other at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">the Reds</a> from 2015 to 2018 before Coutinho left for Barcelona.</p>
      <p>Whilst Coutinho has now joined Bayern Munich on loan, Firmino has instead taken his game to another level at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Firmino might not be hailed as regularly at a national level with Brazil but when it comes to his contribution for the Reds, Liverpool fans adore the forward.</p>
      <p>And that sentiment is shared by Brazil star Coutinho, who sent a message to Firmino after <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool's</a> 2-1 <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/liverpool-verdict-jurgen-klopps-reds-17306740">win over Crystal Palace at the weekend</a> .</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp's men looked likely to drop key points in the Premier League title race when Wilfried Zaha equalised in the 82nd minute, only for Firmino to bag the winner three minutes later.</p>

      <p>Firmino subsequently took to Instagram after the match and posted a picture of him celebrating the goal at Selhurst Park with his Liverpool team-mates.</p>
      <p>Coutinho responded to that post on Instagram by saying: "Craque joga muito."</p>
      <p>That is something which roughly translates as 'ace plays a lot'.</p>
      <p>It's safe to say that Liverpool fans will agree with Coutinho's assessment of his Brazil team-mate Firmino.</p>
