      <h1>Nana Ato Arthur advocates Yes vote at Tarkwa-Nsuaem</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:40:01+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author">Erica Apeatua Addo, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Tarkwa (W/R), Nov 25, GNA - Residents of Tarkwa-Nsuaem constituency have been urged to vote "Yes‚Äù in the December referendum to strengthen grassroot democracy.</p>
      <p>The Head of Local Government Service, Dr Nana Ato Arthur made the call when he paid a working visit to the Tarkwa-Nsueam Munincipality.</p>
      <p>He said the Yes vote would pave the way for Metropolitan, Municipal, District Chief Executives (MMDCEs), Unit committee and assembly members to be elected on partisan basis.</p>
      <p>According to him "this will reduce the friction between Members of Parliament (MPs) and MMDCEs that were in existence for years, promote downward accountability and give MMDCEs security of tenure.</p>
      <p>"Assembly elections have always been partisan, for instance when we are electing presiding members or confirming appointed MMDECs that is where you will see multi-partisanship in our assemblies" he explained.</p>
      <p>The Head of Local Government Service, therefore, called on all eligible voters to vote on December 17 in support of the national referendum to amend Article 55 (3) of the 1992 constitutions, stressing that, it would help develop the country faster.</p>
      <p>Mr Glibert Kenndy Asmah, Municipal Chief Executive (MCE) announced that officers from the Information Services Department, Electoral Commission and the National Commission for Civic Education have received capacity building and resourced enough to sensitise the citizenry on the upcoming District Level elections and the referendum.</p>
      <p>He encouraged Ghanaians to turnout in their numbers and vote Yes for massive change.</p>
