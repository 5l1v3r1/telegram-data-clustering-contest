        <li>England forward pledges to reach Tokyo 2020 despite injuries</li>
        <li>‘I may get some sight back but this won’t be a quick process’</li>
      </ul>
      <p>British hockey player Sam Ward has pledged to do all he can to make the Olympics despite losing the sight in his left eye in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>The GB and England forward, 28, was hit in the face by a ball during the Olympic qualifying victory over Malaysia on 3 November. He underwent surgery 10 days later to reconstruct his cheek.</p>
      <p>“Over the last week, I have received advice from three separate eye consultants,” Ward said. “They have all told me that I have suffered damage to the retina of my left eye and that this damage is partly irreversible.</p>
      <p>“I may get some sight back, but this won’t be a quick process, and whether it will be sufficient for me to get back to playing international hockey only time will tell. It is a tough pill to swallow but, as people know, I am not one to give up easily and I will do everything can to make myself available for selection for Tokyo.”</p>

      <p>It is expected to take several months before the extent of the damage to Ward’s sight is fully understood.</p>
      <p>Great Britain and England Hockey’s performance director, Ed Barney, added: “Sam has suffered a very serious injury. At present, our focus is on supporting Sam to the best possible extent and ensuring that he has access to the best medical provision and wider support.”</p>
