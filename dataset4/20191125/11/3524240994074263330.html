      <h1>With $54.4bn net worth, Bloomberg to earn $1 annually if elected US president —Aide</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:47:38+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:47</time> by <a rel="author">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>An aide to American presidential hopeful, Michael Bloomberg, has said the billionaire business mogul would settle for one dollar per annum as salary if elected.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg confirmed he is joining the crowded field of Democrats, seeking to take on his fellow New York billionaire, incumbent President Donald Trump, just three months before the first primary.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, the 9th richest person in the United States and the 14th richest in the world, has a net worth of $54.4bn.</p>
      <p>The aide, Howard Wolfson, who serves as the politician’s chief adviser, also promised that the former New York mayor would not seek donations from any source to finance his campaigns if given the party ticket.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s news agency, the <i>Bloomberg News</i>, on Sunday outlined several editorial changes it will make as it adjusts to covering its owner as he runs for president.</p>
      <p>“There is no point in trying to claim that covering this presidential campaign will be easy,” said John Micklethwait, editor-in-chief of Bloomberg’s namesake news agency, in a staff email. He cited the company’s policy of not writing about itself or direct competitors.</p>
      <p>Micklethwait outlined a few editorial changes the agency will make but stressed they would make campaign coverage decisions on a case-by-base basis, rather than following an “exhaustive rulebook.”</p>

      <p>“The place where Mike has had the most contact with Editorial is Bloomberg Opinion: our editorials have reflected his views,” Micklethwait wrote. As a result, the company will end its policy of unsigned editorials.</p>
      <p>They will also suspend the editorial Board, in part because several Board members will take leaves of absence to join Bloomberg’s campaign.</p>
      <p>Micklethwait said he intends for the company to cover the campaign’s news “in much the same way as we have done before,” with the exception that articles will explicitly state that Bloomberg News’ owner is a candidate.</p>
      <p>In the email, Micklethwait added that they will not investigate Bloomberg’s family or foundations — the same would go for his Democratic rivals — but would publish or summarize investigative pieces on all Democratic candidates.</p>
      <p>“Bloomberg News has handled these conflicts before,” Micklethwait wrote, pointing to Bloomberg’s mayoral campaign when the media agency adopted similar coverage policies.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg is poised to run as a centrist, and analysts suspect that he could take away some of the support enjoyed by fellow moderate Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>Some believe that his “self-made man” image and support for fighting global warming makes him the best challenger for Trump.</p>
