      <h1>Charles Schwab to Buy TD Ameritrade for $26 Billion as Free Trading Takes Over</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:17:53+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:17</time> by <a rel="author">Tara Siegel Bernard and Matt Phillips</a></address>
      <p>Charles Schwab, which helped pioneer discount investing in the 1970s, said Monday that it would acquire rival TD Ameritrade for $26 billion, a deal that underscores the dramatic changes in how people manage their money.</p>
      <p>The takeover brings together two of the largest online brokerage firms, which together hold roughly $5 trillion in assets, in an industry where intense competition is driving costs down for average investors.</p>
      <p>“This would create a true behemoth in the retail brokerage space,” Chris Allen, an analyst at Compass Point Research &amp; Trading, said in a research note.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://pressroom.aboutschwab.com/press-release/corporate-and-financial-news/charles-schwab-corporation-acquire-td-ameritrade">deal</a> came just a month after Schwab kicked off a rush to eliminate fees on trades of stock and exchange-traded funds. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/your-money/charles-schwab-free-trades.html?module=inline">Schwab’s announcement</a> forced other rivals, including TD Ameritrade and E-Trade, to follow suit.</p>
      <p>The brokerage industry has for years been coping with a price war in the fight for retail investors’ dollars, who are increasingly leaning away from picking and owning individual stocks and more toward low-cost index funds and services that incorporate investment advice.</p>
      <p>“The move to zero commissions in the industry has put several firms in a really tough spot,” said Alois Pirker, research director at Aite Group, a research firm that tracks the financial services industry.</p>
      <p>For Schwab, eliminating commissions cost perhaps $100 million a quarter, or roughly 4 percent of overall revenue, the firm said. But for other players — like TD Ameritrade and E-Trade, who also cut trading commissions — the loss of that revenue created a much larger dent, leaving them vulnerable. <br/><br/>Schwab, Mr. Pirker said, had been diversifying its businesses away from just trading revenue over the past decade. “A couple of years ago, they started calling itself a full-service firm — delivering financial planning and advice in general,” he said. “And the diversification of revenue has gone hand in hand with it.”</p>
      <p>Average investors — even those who do not have direct accounts with Schwab or Ameritrade — could be affected by the deal.</p>
      <p>The companies are among the largest providers that help support independent registered investment advisers: They hold customer assets, execute and clear trades and handle much of the administrative work that goes along with it.</p>
      <p>Schwab is already the largest so-called custodian, with $1.8 trillion in assets managed by registered investment advisers; it controls roughly half of the market according to Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods. Ameritrade now ranks as the third largest player, with up to 20 percent of the market. Fidelity is in second place.</p>
      <p>“We think this deal may face somewhat significant antitrust hurdles,” Kyle K. Voigt, an analyst at K.B.W. said in a research note, “depending on how the competitive market is viewed by relevant authorities.”</p>
      <p>Schwab, based in San Francisco, has more than 19,000 employees and manages an estimated $3.85 trillion in assets. Charles R. Schwab, who founded the discount broker in 1971, is the company’s chairman. TD Ameritrade, with about $1.2 trillion in assets and headquarters in Omaha, has more than 9,000 employees.</p>
