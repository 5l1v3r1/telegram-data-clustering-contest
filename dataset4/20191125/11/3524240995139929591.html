      <h1>Kane hopes ‘winner’ Mourinho can end Spurs trophy drought</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:49:49+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:49</time> by <a rel="author">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>Harry Kane hopes ‘proven winner’ Jose Mourinho can deliver the trophies that Tottenham craves after taking over as manager from Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese, back in the game after 11 months out, led his new club to a 3-2 win at West Ham on Saturday — their first Premier League away win since January.</p>
      <p>Kane was a staunch supporter of Pochettino, crediting him with making him into one of the top strikers in the world, and visited the Argentine at his home after his dismissal.</p>
      <p>“It’s a week I’ve never really had in my career before,” said the England captain.</p>
      <p>“It was a big shock on Tuesday night for everyone, the players included, and then it was a quick turnaround.</p>
      <p>“All of a sudden we’ve got a new manager, one of the best managers there’s been in the game, so automatically you have to turn your head towards that and focus on the game.”</p>
      <p>Pochettino, who took Spurs to the Champions League final in June, ended his five-and-a-half-year stint with no silverware.</p>
      <p>Kane has expressed his desire to win trophies at Spurs and is hoping that Mourinho, a former boss of Chelsea and Manchester United, can help him achieve his goals.</p>
      <p>“The gaffer’s won at every club he’s gone to — there’s no hiding away from that,” Kane said.</p>
      <p>“He wants to win. He’s a proven winner. I’ve made it clear that I’m at the stage of my career where I want to win trophies.</p>
      <p>“I’ve made it clear I want to win them here and it’s a big year for us.”</p>
      <p>Kane said Mourinho’s reputation for winning silverware gave the players confidence.</p>
      <p>“It’s almost a fresh slate for everyone now to show the manager what they can do and hopefully the players can thrive on that,” he said.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Eric Dier said the players were lucky to be able to work under Mourinho, whom he called the “perfect” replacement for Pochettino.</p>
      <p>“His record is unbelievable and he transmits that confidence. The way he speaks, you believe it, you feel it from him,” Dier said.</p>
