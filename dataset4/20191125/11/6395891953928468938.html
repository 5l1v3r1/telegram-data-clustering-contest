      <p><b>BOSTON</b> - A man who police said fled Boston for the Dominical Republic nearly 24 years ago has been arrested and brought back to New England to face a murder charge, the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office announced Sunday. </p>
      <p>Police say William Sanchez, now 46, was at a party in Dorchester in the early morning hours of October 8, 1995 when he was escorted out by a bouncer. According to police, Sanchez came back to the party and shot the bouncer twice. </p>
      <p>Jorge Medina was rushed to the hospital with gunshots to his pelvis and back. He died there just after 4 a.m. that same morning. </p>
      <p>Police say Sanchez was known as Wilman Soto at the time and left his home in Hyde Park for New York City, before returning to his native Dominican Republic. </p>
      <p>According to DA Rachel Rollins' office, it took an extradition treaty with the Dominical Republic in 2015 to allow them to track down Sanchez and bring him back to Boston to face charges. </p>
      <p>Sanchez is set to be arraigned in Suffolk Superior court Monday morning. </p>
