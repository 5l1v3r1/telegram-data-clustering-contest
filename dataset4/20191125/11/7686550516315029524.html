      </figure>
      <p>With panoramic views over the Bristol channel, the homes along Higher Lane are some of the most desirable in Gower - and have a price tag to match.</p>
      <p>The properties along the well-heeled street are separated from tourist hotspots, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/langland">Langland</a> and Rotherslade, by a stretch of ancient field, next to which runs the Wales Coastal Path, linking the two beaches with Limeslade to the west of <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/mumbles">Mumbles</a> .</p>
      <p>While the rest of this headland that juts out to form the end of Swansea Bay and the start of the string of beaches and inlets that make up the southern-facing Gower peninsula is covered with housing, the fields are some of the only green space left.</p>
      <p>Yet some existing residents feel the idyll is under threat.</p>
      <p>There are plans to build 31 homes on the field and take a bite out of the remaining countryside, and it might not be the last.</p>
      <p>Developer, Edenstone Homes, and Coastal Housing Group are behind the proposed development on the 1.3 hectare site, which also includes plans for road infrastructure and landscaping.</p>
      <p>But it isn’t just the partial loss of the stunning views which has upset residents, who have formed an action group to campaign against the plans.</p>
      <p>The proposed location so close to the coastline is one bone of contention, with fears the development would detract from the bucolic nature of the area, potentially impacting on its tourist appeal.</p>
      <p>The accompanying infrastructure, such as roads and access, as well as the potential demand it will make on local schools, are another issue.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Then there are concerns about drainage, and possibly most significantly of all, that the development is claimed to be contrary to <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/gower">Gower</a> ’s Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty status.</p>
      <p>Residents who have formed the opposition action group claimed <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea">Swansea</a> Council had received more than a thousand objections from people supporting their concerns, from all over the UK and even overseas.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the group said: “We were surprised that objections to Swansea Council have come from as far afield as Canada.</p>
      <p>“This part of Gower has been designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and should be preserved for all.</p>
      <p>“If the development goes ahead it will be a blight on the views enjoyed by so many as well as destroying an important ecosystem, that includes badgers, bats and wildflowers.</p>
      <p>“The wellbeing of all of us depends on beautiful spaces, there are other sites in the area that could be developed instead”</p>
      <p>Businesswoman Jill Burgess, one of the objectors, added: “At a time when Swansea Council has declared a climate emergency, it seems nonsensical to develop a site which would involve so many extra car journeys because of its distance from local facilities.</p>
      <p>“It’s just not feasible for older people and families with young children to walk in all weathers and return home up very steep hills.</p>
      <p>“No-one is saying that we shouldn’t provide more houses in the local area, people just feel very strongly about protecting the Gower AONB so that their children and grandchildren will be able to enjoy the walks and amenities that the area provides, for many generations to come.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Such are the concerns, Mumbles Community Council commissioned an independent report on the scheme from planning and development consultants, Lichfields.</p>
      <p>The report highlighted the need for screening which would preserve the privacy of home owners, but which would need to be hedgerows and trees in order not to impact on the nature of the cliff path.</p>
      <p>It also raised concerns about drainage, citing a Swansea Council drainage engineer as saying erosion already occurring at the discharge point and within the channel between the discharge point and the cliff edge would be further exacerbated by the scheme.</p>
      <p>Another issue it highlighted was the opinion that the proposals would not conserve or enhance the natural beauty of the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.</p>
      <p>“The current landscape and visual appraisal provides a ‘light touch’ assessment of the potential effects of the proposals,” the report concludes.</p>
      <p>“This seems inappropriate for such a sensitive environment in the AONB”.</p>

      <p>Carrie Townsend Jones, chairman of Mumbles Community Council, said: “We have sent the report to the developers asking them to address the concerns that have been raised in it, and we are sending it to planning officers asking that they ensure that the concerns are adequately addressed before any planning decision is made.</p>
      <p>“There are concerns regarding access. It is already a very dangerous stretch of road, which is only single lane in parts. We would want to ensure that the development is screened so that the view from the cliff path would be hedgerows and trees rather than housing."</p>
      <p>There is also the point that some of those opposed to the plans may themselves be living in homes on land that was once green fields. When is it right and acceptable to build on one field, but not the one next to it, or the one next to that.</p>
      <p>“We cannot say we are totally against it, or totally for it," added Ms Jones.</p>
      <p>"We recognise that it is right next to existing housing in Beaufort Avenue which in itself was built on fields, but we don’t want to set a precedent; that in the future someone can say we have built on that bit, so we might as well build some more.</p>
      <p>“There is an urgent need for social and affordable housing in this part of Swansea, and there is very limited availability of land in Mumbles to put anything.</p>
      <p>“However, we have to recognise that the cliff path is part of the charm of Mumbles and if people are to enjoy the cliff path, they need to feel they are in the country.”</p>
      <p>Protesters believe the development is putting profit before the need to protect heritage and open spaces. Instead of travelling along the cliff top, they claimed walkers on the coastal path would instead find themselves walking through a housing estate.</p>

      <p>Oystermouth ward councillor Myles Langstone said: “The plans for development on the greenfield site at Higher Lane have been hugely controversial amongst local residents, who do not want to see the natural environment and AONB ruined.</p>
      <p>“The application in front of us appears to be deeply flawed and I have written to the planning department challenging it.</p>
      <p>“I know that a significant number of residents have done the same and I fully expect that it will be appropriately scrutinised.”</p>
      <p>In addition to the community’s council’s report, Swansea Council officers are in the process of writing their own review of the proposals, which will be presented to planning committee members who will ultimately make a decision on the project.</p>
      <p>Edenstone Homes Ltd &amp; Coastal Housing Group have been contacted and asked to comment on their proposal.</p>
