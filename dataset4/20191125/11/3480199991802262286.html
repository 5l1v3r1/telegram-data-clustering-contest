      <p>Students and universities around the UK are experiencing disruption as workers begin an eight-day strike in rows over pay, conditions and pensions.</p>
      <p>Up to 43,000 members of the University and College Union (UCU) at 60 UK institutions are taking part in walk-outs in an action the union has said will affect about a million students in the run-up to the Christmas break.</p>
      <p>Those going on strike include lecturers, student support services staff, admissions tutors, librarians, technicians and administrators.</p>
      <p>UCU general secretary Jo Grady told the PA news agency that further industrial action could follow in the new year if agreements are not reached in the disputes.</p>
      <p>University leaders have said they will try to lessen the impact of the action and insist they want to work with the union to reach an agreement.</p>
      <p>Picket lines are being mounted at campuses across the country, protests held and other forms of industrial action launched, including not covering for absent colleagues and refusing to reschedule lectures lost to strike action.</p>
      <p>Labour’s shadow education secretary Angela Rayner is due to speak at a rally in Manchester.</p>
      <p>UCU said there had been “strong shows of support” for strikes at the universities involved, which it argued “sent a clear message that staff would not settle for pay cuts, increased pension costs or deteriorating conditions”.</p>
      <p>The union said it is consulting with its branches at other universities about ballots to join further action, adding that 3,500 workers have joined UCU in the three weeks since this round of strikes was announced.</p>
      <p>University employers said they anticipate the impact will be “mixed” in the universities where the action has been called, and that there were early reports of “some low and some medium levels of disruption to teaching”.</p>
      <p>Ms Grady told PA: “We have told members they need to be prepared to take eight days of action and they are prepared to take eight days of action.</p>
      <p>“It is sad for university staff to be back here, they don’t take strike action lightly – they don’t get paid and they don’t get to do the jobs they love.”</p>
      <p>Ms Grady added: “If we don’t get a long-term sustainable settlement, then we will be in a position where we will be considering more action.”</p>
      <p>UCU has said staff have reached “breaking point” over issues including workloads, real-terms cuts in pay, a 15% gender pay gap and changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), which the union says will leave members paying in more and receiving less in retirement.</p>
      <p>The union has estimated that the pension changes could leave lecturers around £240,000 worse off in retirement over their career, and up to £730,000 for professors.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for USS employers said: “It’s important to remember that members voting ‘yes’ to strike action over pensions account for less than 10% of the scheme’s eligible membership.</p>
      <p>“Universities are doing everything they can to ensure that students do not lose out. Online learning materials, libraries and student support services will remain available throughout this period to support students’ independent study.</p>
      <p>“Today we are reiterating our call to the union to focus its efforts on continuing talks to reach a joint and fair solution.”</p>
      <p>On the pay dispute, Helen Fairfoul, chief executive of UCEA, said: “We all regret any disruption, especially to students, that is caused by UCU’s strike action that started today.</p>
      <p>“The action UCU has called over its pay dispute is running at around a third of the UK universities that are party to the national pay negotiations, so 90 of these universities are seeing no action at all.</p>
      <p>“We anticipate the impact will be mixed across the 57 universities where action has been called, as they vary greatly in both the size of the institution and the UCU branch.</p>
      <p>“Early reports from universities are of some low and some medium levels of disruption to teaching. It does of course take time for universities to find out how many scheduled classes have not taken place on a given day so some simply cannot tell us yet.</p>
      <p>“Others actually do not have any teaching scheduled. Each university is of course focused on managing this period of disruption as best they can for their students.”</p>

      <p>The strikes will take place on five days this week, and again for three days from December 2.</p>
      <p>Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: “Fair pay, secure contracts, reasonable workloads and decent, affordable pensions should come as standard for all those working in education, including in our universities.</p>
      <p>“Thousands are on strike today because that simply isn’t the case in the increasingly marketised system that the Tories have created. Labour will end the failed free market experiment in education and instead put staff and students first.”</p>
