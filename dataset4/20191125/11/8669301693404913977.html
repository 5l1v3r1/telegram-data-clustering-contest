      <h1>Former captain George Bailey to become part of Australia’s selection panel: Report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:11:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:11</time> by <a rel="author">Scroll Staff</a></address>
      <p>Former limited-overs captain George Bailey is set to be Australia’s new selector after he was picked to be a part of the national selection panel along side coach Justin Langer and chairman Trevor Hohns, according to a report in <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/bailey-to-be-unveiled-as-new-australian-selector-20191125-p53dya.html"><i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i></a> and <i><a href="https://www.theage.com.au/sport/cricket/bailey-to-be-unveiled-as-new-australian-selector-20191125-p53dya.html">The Age</a></i>.</p>
      <p>Bailey, 37, is still an active cricketer and plies his trade in the Big Bash League for Hobart Hurricanes and in the Sheffield Shield for Tasmania.</p>
      <p>Bailey will not be the first active cricketer to be a national selector. In the past Don Bradman and Michael Clarke have taken charge of the post while still being the captain of the national team.</p>
      <p>Bailey, who has represented Australia in five Tests, 90 One-Day Internationals and 30 Twenty20 Internationals, is yet to call it quits from the game.</p>
      <p>Asked about the necessity of a new selector, Cricket Australia head of national teams Ben Oliver said he was really pleased with the people who put their hat in the ring for that role.</p>
      <p>“There will be some people who are really disappointed no doubt but they should all take great encouragement and they all have a lot to offer,” Oliver said.</p>
      <p>Although it is believed that CA is showing keen interest in Bailey because of his vast knowledge of the white-ball formats as a player, especially with next year’s Twenty20 World Cup at home round the corner, Oliver said the new selector would also be involved in selecting squads for Test matches.</p>
      <p>“The panel, and all three, will be responsible for all Australian men’s teams,” Oliver said.</p>
      <p>He added, “What we’ve tried to achieve in this recruitment process is adding in some complementary skills to support Trevor and Justin and one of those is a consideration around short-format cricket.”</p>
