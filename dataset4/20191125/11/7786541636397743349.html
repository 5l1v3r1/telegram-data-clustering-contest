      <p><b>KYIV, UkraineÂ (AP)</b> - Unidentified vandals have painted swastikas on a monument to a prominent Yiddish author in the Ukrainian capital.</p>
      <p>Moshe Reuven Azman, the chief rabbi of Ukraine, posted pictures Monday of the monument to Sholem Aleichem outside Kyiv's synagogue with big red swastikas spray-painted on it.</p>
      <p>Police have opened a probe.</p>
      <p>In a tweet, Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko denounced the anti-Semitic act as "disgusting, appalling and in need of prompt investigation."</p>
      <p>Israeli Ambassador Joel Lion tweeted that "Ukraine has to wake up," urging authorities to track down the culprits, bring them to justice and also "educate against hatred."</p>
      <p>Ukraine has seen numerous cases of vandalism at Jewish cemeteries and Holocaust memorials across the country. Hateful graffiti has also been painted on synagogues and Jewish institutions across the country.</p>
