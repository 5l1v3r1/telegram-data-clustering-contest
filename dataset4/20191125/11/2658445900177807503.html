      <p>The Forum of Political Parties Chairmen has blamed the failures observed in the Kogi and Bayelsa States governorship elections on security agencies, which they blamed for the free run of activities of thugs during the exercises.</p>
      <p>The forum, which had about 62 political parties in attendance, also absolved the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of any blame for the failures that attended the elections in the two states, but commended the Commission.</p>
      <p>According to the communiqué issued by the forum and red out to the media by its National Chairman, Chief Kenneth Udeze, the elections in both states were largely marred by activities of political thugs, who were sponsored by the two main political parties participating in the elections; the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP).</p>

      <p>The forum also condemned the involvement of men of the Nigerian Army in the conduct of elections in the country, alleging that Nigerian Army personnel who were on election duties, just like policemen, aided thugs in disenfranchising the electorate in both states</p>
      <p>It, however, called for the investigation of the Inspector-General of Police, Mr Mohammed Adamu, to explain how more than 35,000 personnel were overran by few political thugs in both states.</p>
      <p>It also called for the conclusion of the amendment of the Electoral Act to breach the intractable electoral failures in the country.</p>
