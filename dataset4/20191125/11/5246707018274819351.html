      <p>We know plenty of people who aren't shy of spending silly amounts of money on Nintendo products, but this takes things to a whole other level.</p>
      <p>Popular Japanese YouTuber, Hikakin, shared a new video over the weekend to his 7.82 million subscribers. In the video, he takes a trip to the <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/nintendos_tokyo_store_is_set_to_open_this_friday_and_its_looking_amazing">lovely-looking new Nintendo store in Tokyo</a>, casually grabbing one of every single item available. <i>Wowzers</i>.</p>
      <p>This includes stacks of Nintendo Switch games, more plushies than we can count, one of every console variant available, and so much more. Seriously, the video's worth a watch just to see the rows and rows of shopping bags that he has after throwing everything at the poor assistant working on the till.</p>
      <p>Feel free to check out the madness below (if you don't have much time, things start getting particularly exciting at around the 16-minute mark). In total, he spent 2,176,758 yen, which equates to roughly $20,000.</p>
