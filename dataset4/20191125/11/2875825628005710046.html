      <p>Dublin's footballers were honoured at Celtic Park on Saturday following their five-in-a-row success.</p>
      <p>A number of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/dublin-gaa">Dublin stars</a> were welcomed onto the famous pitch at half-time during the Hoops' 4-0 win over Livingston.</p>
      <p>Jack McCaffrey, Brian Fenton, Niall Scully and Paddy Andrews were among the players to attend the match in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>They presented <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> with a signed Dublin jersey to help with their Christmas charity appeal.</p>

      <p>Celtic are now top of the table on goal difference.</p>
