      <h1>Bitcoin price drops as China promises crackdown on the cryptocurrency</h1>

      <p>The price of bitcoin has spiralled downwards over the last 24 hours leaving some concerned over the performance of the digital currency.</p>
      <p>It has fallen 10% to beneath the ‘psychological’ $7,000 level. At the time of writing, it was currently sitting at $6,816 (£5,292) which is a sharp decline from the $10,000 it hit earlier in the month.</p>
      <p>Part of the reason for the fall is reported to be tough talk from the Chinese about cracking down on bitcoin.</p>
      <p>‘Once [bitcoin or cryptocurrency trading] is discovered, it will be disposed of immediately, and it will be prevented from happening early,’ reads a recent statement from the <a href="http://shanghai.pbc.gov.cn/fzhshanghai/113571/3926566/index.html">People’s Bank of China</a>, translated through Google.</p>
      <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping said last month that the world’s second-biggest economy should accelerate the development of its own blockchain technology.</p>

      <h3>What is bitcoin and why is it used?</h3>
      <p>Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that is used internationally and is stored completely online as a computer file.</p>
      <p>It works without a central bank and is usually exchanged from person-to-person when it is sold or exchanged, without anyone working in-between to overlook the transaction.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin was first released in 2009 and its value has fluctuated over the last ten years, reaching its peak in December 2017.</p>
      <p>The cryptocurrency can be used to buy products and services, in in 2018 a company in Northern Ireland started to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/02/23/can-now-buy-house-britain-using-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-7336728/">accept Bitcoin as a way of payment</a> to buy a house.</p>
      <p>People can track their ownership of Bitcoin by using a cryptocurrency wallet, which is a digital way to exchange payments.</p>

      <p>It is easy to track Bitcoin as details are stored in a ledger called blockchain, which is publicly accessible and it includes all confirmed transactions.</p>
      <p>The value of Bitcoin fluctuates all the time in a similar way to more conventional currencies.</p>
