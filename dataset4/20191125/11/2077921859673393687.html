      <h1>Apple Renews Servant for Season 2 Ahead of Nov. 28 Premiere</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:12:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:12</time> by <a rel="author">Rachita Vasandani  </a></address>
      <p>Apple has picked up M. Night Shyalaman’s original thriller series <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/11/trailer-apple-servant-m-night-shyamalan.html">Servant</a></i> for a second season ahead of its premiere next week, announced the director on <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Jimmy+Fallon">Jimmy Fallon</a>’s <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/The+Tonight+Show">The Tonight Show</a></i> over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Billed to be about “a Philadelphia couple in the midst of mourning an unspeakable tragedy, which creates a rift in their marriage and opens the door for a mysterious force to enter their home,” the show features <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/11/servant-new-trailer-jericho.html">realistic baby dolls</a> and weirdo babysitters, among other unsettling things—someone please explain why there’s a real baby crying somewhere in the trailer, because that one died a while ago … or so we’re told.</p>
      <p>The first three episodes of the psychological thriller will be released on Nov. 28, with new episodes coming to Apple TV+ weekly, every Friday. The series joins several other Apple originals that have already received second season orders, including “<a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/10/dickinson-review-apple.html">rapturously anachronistic coming-of-age ecstasy trip</a>” <i>Dickinson</i>, <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/11/for-all-mankind-cast-interview.html">For All Mankind</a></i>, <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/11/see-cast-interview-apple-tv.html">See</a></i> and <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/08/first-teaser-for-apple-tvs-the-morning-show-reveal.html">The Morning Show</a></i>, which received a two-season order at pickup.</p>
