      <h2>The $20 Zero 2 doesn't have thumbsticks, but might work in a pinch.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/kris-holt" target="_blank">Kris Holt</a></address>
      <p>It feels like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/11/8bitdo-nes-wireless-mouse-n30/">8BitDo</a> can barely let a month slip by without offering a new Nintendo Switch controller. This time around, it's putting its keychain-sized Zero 2 up for pre-order.</p>
      <p>The adorably tiny controller looks a bit like a smaller version of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/27/8bitdos-latest-switch-controller-ditches-thumbsticks-for-dual-d/">Lite for Switch peripheral</a> 8BitDo revealed a couple of months ago. Zero 2 doesn't include thumbsticks or triggers (though it does have L and R buttons), so you won't really be able to play <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/20/fortnite-season-battle-pass-extended-holiday-event/"><i>Fortnite</i></a> with it.</p>
      <p>The controller will probably work well with 2D games, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/26/super-mario-maker-2-review-switch/"><i>Super Mario Maker 2</i></a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/06/nintendo-no-schedule-for-nes-snes-games/">NES</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/04/snes-nintendo-switch-super-mario-kart-super-mario-world/">SNES libraries</a> available to Switch Online subscribers. If you happen to pick up a couple of these and have a few friends with you, you might even be able to use your Zero 2s and Joy-Cons wherever you are for impromptu four-player <i><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/17/mario-kart-8-tournament/">Mario Kart 8</a> </i>races.</p>
      <p>Zero 2 should be good for up to eight hours of playtime on a single charge, though it doesn't include motion controls or vibration -- it'd be kinda hard to squeeze all the necessary hardware for those into such a small body. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/25/8bitdo-sn30-pro-plus-controller-impressions/">many of 8BitDo's other peripherals</a>, Zero 2 also works with Android, PC and macOS.</p>
      <p>The controller has actually been a long time coming. 8BitDo unveiled a different version with motion controls <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/15/8bitdo-zero2-controller-tiny-switch-hands-on/">at E3 2018</a> and had planned to release it last year. Nonetheless, pre-orders for Zero 2 are now open at Amazon and the controller will ship December 31st. It's available in pink, yellow and turquoise and costs <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081HML6MP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkId=3a77ab594721ae8f6cbb12b6f1bb8f2f&amp;language=en_US">$19.99</a>.</p>
