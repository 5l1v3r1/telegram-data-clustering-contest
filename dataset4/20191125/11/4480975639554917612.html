      <h3>Key Quotes</h3>
      <p>“Risks remain “tilted to the downside”. In particular concerns persist that the ongoing global slowdown could percolate to weaker domestic demand via slower hiring, threatening household spending, the mainstay of US growth. The current level of elevated US corporate debt and a potential widening in credit spreads via worsening credit quality were also mentioned.”</p>
