      <h2>Fans of the show were NOT happy with the trial</h2>

      <p>Fans took to social media in their droves to complain about last night’s bush tucker trial on I’m A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here.</p>
      <p>The task saw James Haskell and Roman Kemp lay on a bed in a Love Island-themed challenge.</p>
      <p>The stars had to battle a 90-second timer to unscrew stars placed in boxes, on either side of the bed, filled with spiders, crabs and cockroaches.</p>

      <p>Fans of the show were outraged after they failed to secure any stars for the trial.</p>
      <p>On unscrewing his first star, Roman Kemp was then attacked by a crab in one of the boxes.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter, viewers claimed it was a “fix” so that the contestants wouldn’t win any meals for camp.</p>

      <p>“That final live trial segment was near impossible. Just unfair on the camp mates,” wrote one viewer.</p>
      <p>“That trial was absolute bullshit. James and Roman weren’t giving enough time at all. The crab was clearly an obstruction and wasn’t fair on them at all,” wrote another.</p>
      <p>Taking to the social media site to defend the trial, Ant and Dec said the “stand-ins did it” when they tested out the task.</p>

      <p>“The stand ins did it when we tested it,” wrote the duo, retweeting a comment from one fan who said:</p>
      <p>“There was no way anyone on this earth could have completed James &amp; Roman’s trial in 90secs.”</p>
      <p>I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here continues on Virgin Media One tonight at 9pm</p>
