        <b>Great Britain hockey player Sam Ward says he will do "everything" to reach the 2020 Olympics after losing the sight in his left eye following a ball to the head.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ward, 28, has been told damage to the retina is partly irreversible after he was struck in the face during the Olympic qualifying play-off win against Malaysia on November 3.</p>
      <p>He scored twice in the match to help book Great Britain's place at next year's Games in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Ward underwent surgery on November 13 to reconstruct his cheek after suffering facial fractures but it will be a number of months before the extent of the injury will be fully known, Great Britain Hockey said.</p>

      <p>"I may get some sight back, but this won't be a quick process, and whether it will be sufficient for me to get back to playing international hockey only time will tell," Ward said, contrary to reports he had already decided to retire.</p>
      <p>"It is a tough pill to swallow but, as people know, I am not one to give up easily and I will do everything can to make myself available for selection for Tokyo."</p>
