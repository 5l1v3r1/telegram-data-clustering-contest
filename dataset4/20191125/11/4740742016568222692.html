      <h1>Watch the heartwarming moment former Bristol City, Bristol Rovers and Nottingham Forest defender's son gives team talk following suspected heart attack</h1>
      <h2>He was hospitalised on Thursday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:48:40+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:48</time> by <a rel="author">David Byrom</a></address>
      <p>There were plenty of well-wishers for Christian Edwards last week following the former defender's suspected heart attack.</p>
      <p>Edwards has close links to <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Bristol Rovers,</a> having played 99 league games for the Gas between 2003 and 2006, but he also previously represented <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> on loan from Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>It meant fans from both <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Rovers</a> and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">the Robins</a> came together last week to send their love to the 43-year-old, who was hospitalised following a suspected heart attack.</p>

      <p>Edwards manages Cardiff Met University <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rovers-city-cardiff-christian-edwards-3569777">and was taking a training session when he suffered the attack.</a></p>
      <p>He has been linked with the university side since joining their teaching staff in 2010 and has helped lead the side to win promotion through four different levels of the Welsh football system to their current spot in the Premier Division.</p>
      <p>They became the first British men's university side to compete in Europe this season <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/former-bristol-rovers-star-aiming-3020497">when they reached the preliminary round of the Europa League.</a></p>
      <p>Despite Edwards' hospitalisation, the side were in action on Saturday, taking on Cefn Druids.</p>
      <p>After their 2-1 win helped leapfrog their opponents into sixth place, they were given a very special team talk from Edwards' son Isaac.</p>

      <p>Giving an impassioned shout that his father would be proud of, Isaac shouted "It's not good enough" before banging on the tactics board to loud roars from the players sat in front of him in the dressing room.</p>
      <p>It was a touching moment at the end of what has no doubt been a difficult week for the university side.</p>
      <p>A statement released by the club said Edwards was 'okay' but under observation in hospital.</p>
      <p>Following Bristol Rovers' victory over Shrewsbury Town on Saturday, Gas manager Graham Coughlan immediately sent the club's best wishes to Edwards in his post-match interview.</p>
      <p>He said: "I just wanted to, from my point of view and the players, the fans and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Bristol Rovers Football Club,</a> we want to send our best wishes on to Christian Edwards who had an incident on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>"We would just like to pass our best wishes on to him and his family, I’m sure the fans will echo that as well.</p>
      <p>"He’s somewhat of a legend at Bristol Rovers as well and our thoughts and prayers are with him this evening."</p>
