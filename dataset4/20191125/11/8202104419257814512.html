      <h3>Crickets for protein is ridiculous</h3>
      <p>Re: Going further beyond meat (SP, Nov. 4)</p>
      <p>The article was about the protein benefits in our nuts, grains, seeds, lentils, peas, and beans.</p>
      <p>What upset me though, was the protein benefits of dried, crushed crickets listed.</p>
      <p>Further in the article, it stated that cricket powder was being added to some of our food in supermarkets today.</p>
      <p>With the wealth of protein choices we produce right here in Saskatchewan, as well as livestock, I am shocked the producers choose to ground crickets as a protein additive.</p>
      <p>We will have to read our food labels more closely in future.</p>
      <p>Will the labels say “protein powder,” or “dried cricket powder?” What kind of protein powder is listed?</p>
      <p>Sorry, I do not want to eat crickets in any form.</p>

        <b>Western provinces require equality</b>
      </p>
      <p>I agree substantially with <a href="https://business.financialpost.com/diane-francis/diane-francis-alberta-needs-a-new-deal-fast-or-separation-is-inevitable">an article written by Diane Francis</a> which appeared in the Nov. 5 StarPhoenix.</p>
      <p>The provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan are getting a raw deal within confederation.</p>
      <p>But Francis failed to mention an important part of the story. Alberta, Saskatchewan, and most of what is now Manitoba were part of a territory controlled from Ottawa. The governor of that territory pressed the federal government to allow the territory to enter Canada as one province.</p>
      <p>Fearing that large of a province might one day prevent Ontario and Quebec from largely controlling the entire country, the territory was instead split into three provinces. Everything on the national level since confirms that attitude.</p>
      <p>I would prefer that Saskatchewan remain in confederation as it is now, but unless Central Canada’s attitude toward the Prairie Provinces changes, the movement toward a separate nation — either within Canada or as an entirely separate country — will justifiably continue. Simply electing a new party in Canada will change nothing. It was, after all, the Conservative Party under Stephen Harper which gave us the equalization formula we have today.</p>

        <b>Hypocrisy</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/questions-remain-following-autopsy-of-infant-girl-found-in-saskatoon-recycling-bin">discovery of an infant’s body in a Saskatoon dumpster</a> is making national news.</p>
      <p>I find the horror and concern hypocritical; aren’t countless babies (only slightly younger) disposed of every day?</p>

        <b>The patience of Saskatchewan’s farmers</b>
      </p>
      <p>Will you allow a Vancouverite to congratulate Saskatchewan farmers on their patience? The Meng Wanzhou case, which has led to China’s retaliations against Canadian farmers and to Canadians being imprisoned there, seems quite static. She was arrested a year ago.</p>
      <p>The latest news I have seen is that the earliest date for settlement of the case is next October, 2020. Nobody asks why this case wasn’t settled months ago, or why it is creeping along so slowly. What heroic patience. I take my hat off to all of you.</p>
