      <h1>KUWK: Khloe Kardashian Posts Ambiguous Message Reading ‘Disappointed But Not Surprised’ – Talking About Tristan Thompson?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:36:55+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:36</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Mitchell</a></address>
      <p>Khloe Kardashian took to social media for her favorite past time, which is seemingly sharing ambiguous quotes that fans then have to decipher and theorize what or who they might be about! This time around, it sounds like she’s talking about her ex, Tristan Thompson!</p>
      <p>The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star’s baby daddy has been actively trying his best to win her back, be it with flirty comments on her posts or by throwing her surprises and showering Khloe with expensive and thoughtful gifts.</p>
      <p>But in a series of new posts, Khloe seemingly dropped some hints that she’s not too happy with the basketball player.</p>
      <p>One such quote actually says that ‘’Disappointed, but not surprised’ has been my biggest mood this year.’</p>
      <p>Considering the betrayal she went through with Tristan after he kissed Kylie Jenner’s former BFF, Jordyn Woods, it would make total sense that she was referring to the two of them, him in particular.</p>
      <p>And this is the second such quote seemingly targeting Tristan that she posted in the last few days.</p>
      <p>She previously also wrote: ‘My mother once told me: ‘Every time that you forgive him, he’ll love you a little more, but you’ll stop loving him, so the day that he loves you the most you won’t feel anything for him anymore.’</p>
      <p>Tristan and Jordyn crossing the line at his house party was the second time the basketball player cheated on Khloe.</p>
      <p>When he was unfaithful just days before she welcomed their baby girl, True, Khloe decided to give him a second chance but, obviously, he took it for granted.</p>
      <p>Now, it’s become apparent that he wants Khloe back once more but it doesn’t seem like the reality TV star has any intention of trying again with him.</p>
