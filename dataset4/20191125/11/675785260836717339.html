      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:05:40+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:05</time> by <a rel="author">Lily Waddell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lily-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>I'm A Celeb viewers were roaring with laughter as a blended cockroach drink was named after Caroline Flack.</p>
      <p>During Sunday's installment, Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly brought ITV's steamiest show Love Island to the jungle with a few nasty surprises.</p>
      <p>Known for their hilarious jokes, it's no wonder the presenters' pun on Caroline Flack's name sent fans into a fit of giggles.</p>
      <p>They had dubbed the cockroach smoothie Caroline Yack in tribute to the Love Island host which tickled the sense of humour of viewers.</p>
      <p>"CAROLINE YACK IM SCREAMING <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACelebrity?src=hashtag_click">#ImACelebrity</a><a href="https://twitter.com/carolineflack1">@carolineflack1</a> ." One fan wrote, leading the troops.</p>

      <p>Ant and Dec were on top form as the Love Island hosts in the I'm A Celeb jungle.</p>
      <p>They also named a drink Iain Hurling after voiceover star Iain Stirling which got fans giggling.</p>
      <p>Others added: "Caroline Yack. Cocktail in honour of Caroline Flack. Comprised of blended cockroaches. Appropriate."</p>
      <p>"Caroline Yack.. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> ."</p>
      <p>"Caroline yack" and "Ian Hurling" How I love the names they come up with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> ."</p>
      <p>"Caroline yack cannot make this up <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/imacelebrity?src=hashtag_click">#imacelebrity</a> ."</p>

      <p>Despite the trial, Jacqueline Jossa was equally excited on I'm A Celeb when she walked onto the Love Island-style set.</p>
      <p>The soap star was the most excited to see the Love Island set - complete with hot tub, fire pit and kitchen - practically dancing on as the show's theme music blared out.</p>
      <p>As she skipped in behind Roman Kemp, Jac shouted out. She said: "WAHOO!"</p>
      <p>"Oh my god," she gasped as she took in the surroundings.</p>
      <p>"I've always wanted to do Love Island!"</p>
