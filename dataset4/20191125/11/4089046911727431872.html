      <p><b>(CNN) -</b> A small plane ended up hanging upside down from power lines in rural Minnesota Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The single-propeller piper cub got stuck about 25 miles southwest of Minneapolis. After the power lines were de-energized, the 65-year-old pilot was safely rescued.</p>
      <p>"This incident could have been much worse,” said Luke Hennen, sheriff of Scott County. “We are grateful the pilot was able to walk away without any injuries."</p>
