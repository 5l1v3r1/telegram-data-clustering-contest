        <b>On November 24, Deputy President William Ruto took to the altar to deliver the much-awaited sermon at Priesthood fellowship Church at Kahawa West, a rare moment when skills gained during his Christian Union days in college came handy.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a video obtained by <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/">Kenyans.co.ke</a>, Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung’wa was tasked with the role of introducing the DP to the altar as the church Bishop J.J. Gitahi looked on.</p>
      <p>The DP was in no way to goof on the altar taking to the podium with his Bible held in his hands ready to do God’s work.</p>

      <p>“We are going to have our reading from Mathew 6:33. Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness and everything else shall be added to you as well,” read the DP.</p>
      <p>“Even when we bear big titles like Honorables, His. Excellencies and others, we all fall under the word of God. It clearly communicates to us that despite our positions we need to seek God’s kingdom and his righteousness too,” added the DP.</p>
      <p>The deputy president was not to end there but rather picked another verse in continuity with the sermon.</p>
      <p>“In Deuteronomy 8:11-20, the Bible tells us to be careful that we do not forget the Lord our God, failing to observe his commands, his laws, and his decrees that He has given unto us."</p>
      <p>“Otherwise, when we eat and are satisfied when we build fine houses and settle down, and when our herds and flocks grow large and our silver and gold increase, we should not forget our God.” </p>

      <p>The DP further reiterated on the need to trust in God alone rather than trusting in self-power and earthly riches.</p>
      <p>He ended the sermon leaving behind a rejuvenated congregation, Kikuyu MP coming in to end the session with a closing prayer.</p>
      <p>This was DP Ruto's fourth visit to a church on the same day, where he facilitated funds collection for various church projects.</p>
      <p>The DP’s day started at AIPCA Maguguni church in Thika East where the service was led by the church’s archbishop Julius Njoroge</p>
      <p>He later headed to the PCEA Maguguni Church before attending a service at Alter Israel Holy Spirit Church and finally heading to Priesthood Fellowship Church.</p>
