      <p>The son of an Alabama deputy sheriff is suspected of fatally shooting a neighboring county’s sheriff during a confrontation at a gas station on Saturday night, a report said.</p>
      <p>William Chase Johnson, 18, whose dad is a deputy sheriff in Montgomery County, was arrested on suspicion of murdering Lowndes County Sheriff John Williams at a QV gas station in Hayneville, according to NBC News.</p>

      <p>Details surrounding the fatal shooting were still murky as of early Monday. The state’s governor, Kay Ivey, had confirmed the news of Williams’ death via Twitter Saturday night.</p>
      <p>“I’m saddened to hear about Sheriff Big John Williams, who was tragically killed this evening in the line of duty,” Ivey wrote.</p>
      <p>“He will be remembered as a consummate professional and pillar of his community.”</p>
      <p>Johnson was captured hours after the shooting when he returned to the scene early Sunday morning with a handgun, according to Sgt. Steve Jarrett, commander of state troopers’ Montgomery post.</p>

      <p>The Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office told local NBC affiliates that Johnson was the son of one of its deputies, the report said.</p>
      <p>“Details as to how he fled the scene and then reappeared at the scene, all that’s going to be investigated,” Jarrett said, according to WSFA-TV.</p>
      <p>Williams was first elected sheriff in 2010. He joined the department in 1987 and was appointed chief deputy in 1990.</p>
