      <h1>Monday Matricide: Bangkok boy accused of chopping up mom and refrigerating pieces</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:00:50+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bangkok" target="_blank">Coconuts Bangkok</a></address>
      <p>Police in southwest Bangkok made a grisly discovery this afternoon inside a family’s fridge: a woman’s head, torso, legs and arms. </p>
      <p>Next to the fridge, police in the Bang Khun Thian district also found a second-year university lying in a pool of blood, critically injured by an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. The student – who is now the lead suspect in sawing up what turned out to be his mother – was rushed to the nearby Nakornthon Hospital, <a href="http://policenews.co.th/%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%A8%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%AA%E0%B9%8C/detail/54a4z253">according to the police</a>.</p>
      <p>Initial investigations found the dismembered woman, 42-year-old Yuri Taowan, had been living with her son, 20-year-old Sira Somdech, in the home where her remains were found. She was last heard from at about 8pm on Sunday when she spoke by phone with a friend. </p>
      <p>She had become unreachable by Monday morning, and the friend went to pay her a visit. The unidentified friend reportedly ran into the suspect, who said his mother was not home. However, the friend became suspicious and decided to look around because her car remained in the driveaway.</p>
      <p>The woman got the shock of a lifetime when she opened up the fridge – police said she noticed it was ajar – and discovered parts of the dead woman sitting in the freezer compartment. Panicked, the friend screamed and turned to ask the suspect about the body parts. That’s when he reportedly put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, another friend of the victim told police that the mother and son often fought but were never known to be violent. The police were told the suspect, whose name or age were not made public, suffers from depression and had just visited the hospital last week. </p>
      <p>Later this afternoon, police discovered a chopping cleaver and hammer they beleive were the murder weapons. Investigators were also removing a toilet they believed might contain more body parts.</p>
      <p>National police chief Chakthip Chaijinda said late Monday afternoon the police would quickly get to the bottom of what happened.</p>
