      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:54:04+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/phil-savage/" target="_blank">Phil Savage</a></address>
      <p>If you're looking for a cheap entry-level <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-laptop/">gaming laptop</a> that still features decent performance at 1080p, Newegg is offering the MSI GF63 Thin <a href="https://www.newegg.com/black-msi-gf-series-gf63-thin-9rcx-659-gaming-entertainment/p/N82E16834155306">for $599</a>, with a $100 rebate card bringing the final price to just $499. While its GTX 1050 Ti is a few years old now, it's a great <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-pc-gaming-deals-2019/">Black Friday PC gaming deal</a> for a respectable gaming laptop. If you're on a student budget, or just looking to buy a younger family member a cheaper laptop for gaming, this is a great deal.</p>
      <p>Aside from the GTX 1050 Ti, the laptop also offers a Core i5-9300H, 8GB memory and a 15.6" 1920x1080 IPS screen. As a nice extra, it's 1TB hard-drive is also paired with a 128GB NVMe SSD that should keep Windows and a handful of essential applications feeling fast and responsive.</p>
      <p>We last looked at the GTX 1050 Ti a couple of years ago, and found that, while it's an entry-level card, it's perfectly capable of running recent games at medium settings at 1080p. While it's going to struggle to run big-budget graphical powerhouses like Red Dead Redemption 2, it should be perfect for optimised titles like Fortnite, Overwatch, and other <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-laptop-games/">laptop-friendly PC games</a>.</p>
      <p>If you're looking for something a little beefier at a similarly budget price, there's also a Black Friday deal on an ASUS laptop with a GTX 1650 <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/this-gaming-laptop-from-asus-with-a-gtx-1650-is-now-just-dollar580/">for just $580</a>.</p>
