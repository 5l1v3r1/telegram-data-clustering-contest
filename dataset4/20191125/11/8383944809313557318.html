While admittedly zoos can be difficult to visit for animal lovers, this particular zoo was opened in 1993 by its namesake, one of the country's most significant ambassadors for wildlife conservation and thus placed heavy emphasis on giving the animals it harbors such as giraffes, zebras, lions, penguins and Turkey's first red panda and sloth, as natural a habitat as possible. While Faruk Yalçın was a successful businessman for most of his life, he had also written 21 books on plant and animal care before his death just over a decade ago. This 80,000 square meter area, which makes for hours of entertainment strolling its paths past different domiciles for animals purports to have over 3,600 animals of 286 species and over 600 different types of botanical plants as well as a café and gift shop.<br/><br/><b>Flamingoköy in Çatalca </b><br/><br/>Flamingoköy is a nature park and rustic breakfast restaurant in Çatalca, which is an opportune get away from the European side of Istanbul. While on weekdays, they serve a breakfast spread, on weekends there is an open buffet, with either offering a wonderful opportunity to witness flamingoes as they wade in pools that are lined with tables. In addition to flamingos, there are also a variety of birds such as ducks, geese, peacocks and swans and the opportunity to rent a water bike.<br/><br/><b>Natürköy in Sapanca Lake </b><br/><br/>A popular destination year-round for city dwellers, Sapanca Lake has a lot to offer for a day trip getaway.

The banks of the lake span nearly 2.5 kilometers, and the surrounding area has been reforested, making it a bird haven, with over 154 different types spotted. The park also provides sanctuary for a wide variety of wildlife, spanning from foxes, jackals, weasels, rabbits and squirrels.
