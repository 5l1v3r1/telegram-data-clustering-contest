      <p><b>LEVI, FINLAND – </b>Henrik Kristoffersen has finally triumphed again in a men’s World Cup slalom after 22 months, winning the first race since the retirement of his longtime nemesis Marcel Hirscher.</p>
      <p>Competing in foggy conditions and snowfall, Kristoffersen edged first-run leader Clement Noel on Sunday to win the first slalom of the season.</p>
      <p>It was the Norwegian’s 16th career victory in the discipline, but the first since winning in Kitzbuehel in January 2018.</p>
      <p>“After the first run I thought: ‘Seven-tenths on Noel, that’s a bit too much,'” said Kristoffersen, who trailed the Frenchman by 0.68 seconds after the opening leg but beat his French rival by 0.09 thanks to a near-flawless second run.</p>
      <p>“My skiing in slalom is much better than last year, we have worked a lot,” he said. “It was not a perfect run but it’s going in the right direction.”</p>
      <p>Kristoffersen and Hirscher dominated the slalom circuit for years, with the Austrian mostly coming out on top.</p>
      <p>No other skier than Hirscher (six times) or Kristoffersen (once) has won the season title in the discipline in the past seven seasons.</p>
      <p>“In 2015, 16, 17, we were very fast, Marcel and me. Then we were a bit over the limit, I think,” Kristoffersen said. “I had to take back a bit: a bit less speed and a bit more focus on technique. Taking one step back to go three steps forward.”</p>
      <p>With Hirscher, the record eight-time overall champion from Austria, now retired, the competition for a new slalom champion is wide open.</p>
      <p>Noel confirmed his status as one the leading racers in the discipline by posting the fastest time in the opening run, building a lead of 0.39 seconds over Britain’s Dave Ryding.</p>
      <p>In the second run, however, Noel had a costly mistake going into the steep part of the Levi Black course while Ryding, chasing his first win, slid off the course midway down the hill and failed to finish.</p>
      <p>“It was a good race. It was really difficult in the second run,” Noel said. “It’s a good way to start the season. I am playing with the big boys and I am happy about that.”</p>
      <p>Noel had his breakthrough in the final two months of last season. Without a World Cup podium finish to his name, Noel finished runner-up in Adelboden in January before winning races in Wengen, Kitzbuehel and Soldeu.</p>
      <p>It earned him second place, shared with Switzerland’s Daniel Yule, behind Hirscher in the slalom season standings.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Yule improved from seventh after the opening run to third, 0.18 behind Kristoffersen.</p>
      <p>Noel’s French teammate Alexis Pinturault finished 2.48 off the lead in the opening run and failed to qualify for the second.</p>
      <p>Pinturault won the season-opening giant slalom last month and is widely regarded a main candidate for the overall title.</p>
      <p>The men’s World Cup continues next week in Lake Louise, Alberta, with a downhill on Saturday and a super-G the following day, the first speed events of the season.</p>
