      <p>Local weather guru <b>Louth Weather</b> has posted the forecast for the week ahead this morning and it looks like another classic mixed bag of showers, then dry conditions, but a lot cooler.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MONDAY - Last night's rain has already cleared the south of the county and this clearance will continue north. So everywhere should dry up by late morning. The rest of the day will be cloudy and misty, though overall dry. A few showers will occur, most likely this evening. Light to moderate SE winds. Mild at 12°C.</b>
        <br/>

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>WEDNESDAY - A few showers about but mostly dry. Overall cloudy though the sun may break through at times. Moderate northerly winds. Max 10°C.</b>
