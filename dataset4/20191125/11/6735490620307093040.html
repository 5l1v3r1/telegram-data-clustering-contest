      <h1>Keri Russell Talks ‘Star Wars’ And Expiration Dates In Hollywood</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:16:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:16</time> by <a rel="author">Becca Longmire</a></address>
      <p>Keri Russell talks about “Star Wars”, being a shy person and how long she thinks she’ll end up working in Hollywood in a new interview with<i><a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a29825639/keri-russell-star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-interview-2019/"> Town &amp; Country.</a></i></p>
      <p>Russell, who is set to star as Zorri Bliss in the upcoming “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker”, says of her character having to wear a mask in the much-talked-about flick: “…It was very attractive, the idea of not being the lead. The mask – I felt safe in it. And tough.”</p>
      <p>The actress adds of balancing work and family life: “I see a lot of other people who have great ambition, but I feel as if my life is so full, with little kids. I’m not hungry for a certain type kind of success.”</p>

      <p>Russell may be a star, but she says she’s still shy when you put a camera in front of her.</p>
      <p>“Being photographed is a skill, and I’m not good at it. I’m a shy person, so it’s embarrassing. And I’m 43 now, so I’m able to say it’s embarrassing to me. It’s weird. I always look bad!”</p>

      <p>She says of whether she feels she has an expiration date in Hollywood: “I do think about it. And I feel that [the time dwindling for roles] should sort of be now. But at the same time, I just got an incredible offer to do something. A really, really rich story. Maybe it doesn’t stop.”</p>
      <p>The new issue of <i>Town &amp; Country</i> hits newsstands November 27.</p>
