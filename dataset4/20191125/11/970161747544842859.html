      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mohamed-salah/">Mohamed Salah</a> was ‘desperate’ to start for Liverpool against <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/crystal-palace-fc/">Crystal Palace</a> but ‘accepted’ <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s decision to place him on the bench, according to Andy Robertson.</p>
      <p>Salah has scored nine goals in 17 appearances for the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> leaders this season despite struggling with an ankle injury.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old did not link up with his Egyptian team-mates during the recent international break and Klopp opted to start Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain ahead of him at Selhurst Park on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Despite Salah’s absence, Liverpool maintained their eight-point gap at the top of the Premier League with a thrilling 2-1 win over Roy Hodgson’s Palace.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the win, Robertson revealed he was playing through pain during the match and lifted the lid on how Salah reacted to being benched.</p>

      <p>‘It is still painful but, you know, it is something that I gave time for it to improve,’ the superstar full-back said.</p>
      <p>‘Keeping it moving will help it. Hopefully in time it will be better. I was desperate to play and the gaffer asked me if I was OK. I believed I was and luckily I got through the game.</p>
      <p>‘Me and Mo were in the same position. Mo was desperate to play as well and the manager made the decision [to rest Salah] and Mo was fine and accepted it.</p>
      <p>‘You don’t want to miss any games but if it means him missing one game rather than six, that is a big difference. Sometimes you need to be a bit clever.</p>

      <p>‘I have come through, Mo was not needed although he was stripped when Bobby scored and sat back down.</p>
      <p>‘Hopefully that will give him more time to settle and hopefully he will be fine for midweek.’</p>
      <p>Liverpool appeared to be set to drop two points against Palace after Wilfried Zaha cancelled out Sadio Mane’s opening goal on 82 minutes.</p>

      <p>But Roberto Firmino scored Liverpool’s second just three minutes later to ensure the visitors returned to Anfield with another victory.</p>

      <p>On in-form attacker Mane, Robertson added to the <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/374569-andy-robertson-fitness-clean-sheets-sadio-mane">Liverpool website</a>: ‘He has been fantastic.</p>
      <p>‘Even when I came he was amazing but maybe did not have as much composure as he does now in front of goal.</p>
      <p>‘Now every time he’s in front of goal you don’t think he’ll miss. The one he had at the start of the second half, we were surprised he didn’t score and that is the type of player he is.</p>
      <p>‘You expect him to score and that is a good thing and he’s popped up with another crucial goal.</p>
      <p>‘It’s been a fantastic year for him and let’s hope he can keep going for a full season instead of a calendar year – that would help.</p>
      <p>‘The others are pitching in as well but it’s been a fantastic year for him and he’s taken his game to another level.’</p>
