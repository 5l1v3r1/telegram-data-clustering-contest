        <i>Mushrooms and mash are an unexpected hit of a food match. You heard it here first</i>
      </p>
      <p>After another early-morning deluge followed by sunshine, Testaccio, Rome, is warm and soupy. On my way to the market, I see a cluster of tiny, white toadstools at the base of a tree: mischievous white hats in a sea of stewed leaves. Much better are the mushrooms at the market, especially those from <i>Il Velletrano</i>. The family that runs fruit and vegetable stall no.32 comes from a town south-east of Rome called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velletri">Velletri</a>, hence the father, Giancarlo’s, nickname, Il Velletrano. Velletri is the city with the highest precipitation in Lazio, and is one of the rainiest cities in Italy; rain that comes down at a rate that seems impossible, then, like a needle being yanked from a record, stops as suddenly as it started. Velletri’s proximity to the sea and the cupping protection of the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Alban+Hills/@41.6323482,12.7688791,2369a,35y,0h,77.89t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x1325846303def02b:0x654a8755e036237a!8m2!3d41.729985!4d12.6995231">Alban</a> hills means it is also a city with a mild climate. All these factors make the surrounding countryside good for mushrooming – if you know where to go on a quiet hunt, which Giancarlo does.</p>
      <p>This mild November has been good for <i>galletti</i>, also known by their proper name <i>Cantharellus cibarius</i>, or chanterelles. Orange-yellow with soft gills, they look like a wind-inverted umbrella or fluted funnel, the name “chanterelle” comes from the Greek <i>kantharos</i>, meaning “tankard” or “cup.” Galletti are often preserved under olive oil in Italy and then used to top and enhance other dishes, which is where the notion that they are <i>il prezzemolo dei funghi</i> (the parsley of mushrooms) comes from. Galletti are also, like me, a natural partner for pasta. One of my favourites dishes this year was eaten at Taverna Mari in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grottaferrata">Grottaferrata</a>: a silky, slender fresh egg <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/feb/16/four-winter-pasta-recipes-bancone-brown-shrimp-tagliolini-lamb-ragu-pappardelle-silk-handkerchiefs-tagliatelle-chestnuts-chervil">tagliolini</a> with galletti (which cook into almost velvet softness) with a sauce of sweet <a href="https://www.specialtyproduce.com/produce/Datterini_Tomatoes_12885.php">datterini</a> tomatoes flecked with chilli. I had a moment of mourning when I ate the last forkful.</p>
      <p>It has been quite a good year for the queen of local mushrooms, the russet-capped <i>ovolo</i>; and a pretty good one for the king, or “little pig”, the porcino. I have read many descriptions of porcini; the best, though, is that of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/dec/04/guardianobituaries.food">Alan Davidson</a>, in his Oxford Companion to Food, who compares the bulbous stem to a champagne cork and the colour of the cap to a glazed bun. At €30 a kilo, they are closer to champagne than sticky buns – although, having endured a few bumps and bruises, Giancarlo gives them to me for €28, so that’s €14 for 500g: expensive but not extortionate, and a real treat.</p>
      <p>Porcini are like a good steak, or any good ingredient, really: they are best cooked and served simply. While smaller, fresh porcini can be served raw (sliced paper-thin and dressed with olive oil and maybe some crystal shards of parmesan), it is heat that brings out the rich flavour and curious, almost custardy texture of the cap. I like them sliced and grilled (in a ridge or hot cast-iron pan) or <i>trifolati</i>, which means <i>cuocere a fuoco vivace con olio, aglio e prezzemolo</i> (cooked over a lively flame with oil, garlic and parsley).</p>
      <p>A paintbrush, sharp knife and damp cloth are the best way to clean porcini: one per person is enough, two per person a treat. If you can’t get porcini, field mushrooms are a good alternative. You want to keep as much of them as possible, so brush, scrape or pare away any grit or earth from the stalk, then use a damp cloth to wipe the stalk and cap.</p>
      <p>It was the chef <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/22/anna-tobias-recipe-poached-chicken-spring-veg-aioli">Anna Tobias</a> who paired her porcini with buttery mashed potato, a concept that nagged at me until I made it at home. The contrast of the soft, almost custardy-but firm porcini flesh glistening with butter beside a cloud of potato is untroubled pleasure, and another favourite thing this year. Again, I had a moment of sadness when I ate the last mouthful.</p>
      <h3>Porcini and mashed potato</h3>
      <p>Prep<b> 15 min<br/></b>Cook <b>30 min<br/></b>Serves<b> 2</b></p>
      <p><b>2 or 3 porcini or 250g field mushrooms<br/>1 kg potatoes</b>, peeled and halved<br/><b>Butter<br/>Whole milk<br/>Salt and pepper<br/>4 tbsp olive oil<br/>1-2 garlic cloves</b>, peeled and gently crushed (split but still whole)<br/><b>1 heaped tsp chopped parsley</b></p>
      <p>Clean the mushrooms using a cloth or little knife to brush, scrape or pare away any grit or earth from the stalk, then use a damp cloth to wipe the stalk and cap. Cut the mushrooms into 2mm slices, cutting the cap and stem separately, if you prefer.</p>
      <p>Put the potatoes on to boil. Once tender, drain and mash with plenty of butter, whole milk, salt and pepper, and keep warm.</p>
      <p>In a large frying pan, warm the oil, a little butter and the garlic, until the garlic is fragrant. Add the mushroom, raise the flame and cook, stirring, for a few minutes until they absorb the fat, then reduce the flame and cook for eight to 10 minutes, or until they are cooked through: the time needed will depend on the mushrooms.</p>
      <p>In the last 30 seconds, add salt, pepper and parsley, raise the heat and stir.</p>
      <p>Serve the porcini immediately beside a spoonful of mash, with any pan juices poured over the top and a swirl of olive oil, if you wish.</p>
