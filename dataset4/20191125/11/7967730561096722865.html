      <p>The atmospheric concentration of key greenhouse gases hit new highs in 2018, reaching levels not seen in at least 3 million years when sea-levels were as much as 20 metres higher than now.</p>
      <p>The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a United Nations agency, said on Monday that globally averaged concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) reached 407.8 parts per million (ppm) last year, up from 405.5 in 2017.</p>

      <p>CO2 contributes about 80 per cent of the warming effect on the climate - known as radiative forcing - among the long-lived greenhouse gases. The 2.3 ppm increase of the gas in 2018 was close to the level of the previous year, and just above the average over the last decade of 2.26 ppm, the WMO said.</p>
      <p>“There is no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decline, in greenhouse gases concentration in the atmosphere despite all the commitments under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change," said Petteri Taalas, WMO's Secretary-General.</p>

      <p>“We need to translate the commitments into action and increase the level of ambition for the sake of the future welfare of mankind,” he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Global levels of CO2 crossed the symbolic and significant 400 parts per million benchmark in 2015. In the southern hemisphere, that level was breached in 2016, <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-govfq7.html">as the <i>Herald</i> and <i>The</i> <i>Age</i> reported at the time</a>.</p>
      <p>The WMO said the continuing long-term trend meant future generations would be "confronted with increasingly severe impacts of climate change, including rising temperatures, more extreme weather, water stress, sea level rise and disruption to marine and land ecosystems".</p>
      <p>Emissions from the two other most important greenhouse gases - methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) - accelerated in 2018.</p>
      <p>Methane, which contributes about 17 per cent of radiative forcing, is about 60 per cent sourced from human activities like cattle breeding, rice agriculture, fossil fuel exploitation, landfills and biomass burning, WMO said.</p>
      <p>Last year, methane concentrations rose 10 parts per billion (ppb) to 1869, up from an increase of 7.1 ppb per year over the past decade.</p>
      <p>For nitrous oxide, the increase last year was 1.2 ppb to an atmospheric concentration of 331.1 ppb.</p>
      <p>The rise of the gas - partly driven by nitrogen fertiliser use and rising manure levels as livestock numbers swell - compared with an increase of 0.95 per year over the past decade.</p>
      <p>Since 1750, taken as the start of the industrial revolution that triggered a jump in greenhouse gases, CO2 levels have risen 47 per cent, methane by 159 per cent and nitrous oxides by 23 per cent.</p>

      <p>Almost half, or 43 per cent, of the total radiative forcing caused by the increased levels of those gases in the atmosphere has occured since 1990, the WMO said.</p>
      <p>That's despite dozens of international meetings and two major agreements - the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris accord - signed by the world's nations pledging to bring emissions of the gases under control.</p>
      <p>“It is worth recalling that the last time the earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago," Mr Taalas said. "Back then, the temperature was 2-3°C warmer, sea level was 10-20 metres higher than now."</p>
      <p>About a quarter of the total emissions is absorbed by the oceans - altering its chemistry- and another quarter by the biosphere, the WMO said.</p>
      <p>The latest data was released days before the next <a href="https://wmo.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=daf3c1527c528609c379f3c08&amp;id=b29ea66529&amp;e=695295acb0">UN Climate Change Conference,</a> which will be held from December 2-15 in Madrid, Spain.</p>
