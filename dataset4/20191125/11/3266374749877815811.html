      <h1>Manchester United Player Ratings vs Sheffield United: Four players get 4; 8/10 de Gea, Rashford the difference makers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:42:19+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/author/varun-madhav/" target="_blank">Keshav Awasty</a></address>
      <h3>Marcus Rashford was denied a late winner as Oliver McBurnie struck a 90th minute equaliser to ensure a 3-3 draw for Sheffield United against Manchester United.</h3>
      <p>Manchester United had David de Gea to thank as a stunning double save kept the game at 0-0. But, de Gea could do nothing when John Fleck scored from a rebound following another save to deny John Lundstram. After going up, Sheffield United asserted their dominance further, but could not add to their advantage going into half-time.</p>
      <p>Early into the second half, though, Lys Mousset doubled the hosts’ lead with a fantastic long-range strike. But, a seven-minute spell saw Manchester United turn the tide, as Brandon Williams, Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford scored a goal each to make it 3-2.</p>
      <p>However, just when it looked like Manchester United had done enough to complete the comeback, Oliver McBurnie scored from point-blank range to get the game back on level terms. And, that is how the match ended, with the two sides playing out a 3-3 draw. The Hard Tackle now runs the rule over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men.</p>
      <h4>David de Gea: 8/10</h4>

      <p>Seldom does a goalkeeper secure this high a rating when he has conceded three goals. But, David de Gea was the chief reason why Manchester United were even in the game till its latter stages. A stunning double save early on denied John Lundstram and David McGoldrick before Lundstram was thwarted again minutes later.</p>
      <p>But, de Gea could not have done anything to prevent John Fleck from scoring the rebound. Blameless for the other two goals as well. Otherwise, de Gea was in sublime form against Sheffield United, distributing the ball well too. Is he back to his best at long last? Manchester United fans and Solskjaer will definitely hope so.</p>
      <h4>Victor Lindelof: 4/10</h4>
      <p>Not called into action as much as Harry Maguire and Phil Jones. But, when he was tested, Lindelof appeared to be rather hesitant, especially against the imposing figure of David McGoldrick. On the ball, the Swede was assured, but he needs to become more composed while defending,</p>
      <h4>Harry Maguire: 4/10</h4>
      <p>Hardly as bad Lindelof and Jones, but Maguire had his fair share of problems too, particularly when Lys Mousset took the game to him. Additionally, the fact that Manchester United were so disorganised at the back is down to Maguire, who is supposed to be their leader at the back. Has gone off the boil a bit, lately.</p>
      <h4>Phil Jones: 3/10</h4>

      <p>Making his first Premier League start of the season, Jones started in decent fashion and was combative in his approach. But, he was constantly dragged out of position and was beaten too easily by Mousset in the lead-up to the opening goal. Remained nervy for the remainder of the half before being rightly taken off at the break. Might just be his last league start for a while.</p>
      <h4>Aaron Wan-Bissaka: 5.5/10</h4>
      <p>Wan-Bissaka was not tested nearly as much as Brandon Williams on the left flank and was solid on the odd occasion that he was. The disappointing bit about his performance was the sheer inefficacy of his pursuits in the final third. Over the course of the season that has been the norm, but as a wing-back, he needed to do more going forward.</p>
      <h4>Andreas Pereira: 4/10</h4>
      <p>A dreadful performance by Pereira, who just is not justifying Solskjaer’s constant faith in him. Embodied the hollowness in the Manchester United midfield, regularly losing the ball in dangerous areas, including for the second Sheffield United. Barely created anything of note and it is perplexing how he starts week in week out in the Premier League.</p>
      <h4>Fred: 4/10</h4>
      <p>Much like Pereira, Fred was a passenger and struggled to get into the game. Supposed to be the designated holding midfielder for Manchester United, Fred was overrun with ease by Lundstram and Fleck. This is the kind of inconsistency that is proving to be detrimental to his chances of becoming a regular for United.</p>
      <h4>Brandon Williams: 7/10</h4>

      <p>For much of the first half, Williams was backed up against a wall on the defensive front, although there were some impressive moments too. Much improved post the interval before sparking hopes of a comeback with a fantastic right-footed strike. Growing with every passing game and has a bigger role to play ahead.</p>
      <h4>Daniel James: 6.5/10</h4>
      <p>James was not quite at his best on Sunday, but he still was one of Manchester United’s best players on the day. As always, the Welsh winger was an industrious presence on the pitch and was not afraid to take defenders on.</p>
      <p>But, his end product was missing for much of the game, although there was another indication of his growing understanding with Rashford, as he provided a superb assist to the Englishman.</p>
      <h4>Anthony Martial: 5/10</h4>
      <p>Sub-par. Starting as more of a false nine, Martial attempted to drag his marker out of position, only to see Sheffield United defending in solid fashion. Kept at bay for much of his time on the pitch and his only shot on target was a rather speculative effort. But, there is only so much one can do when they are deprived of quality service.</p>
      <h4>Marcus Rashford: 8/10</h4>

      <p>Rashford was rather underwhelming in the first half, when he just could not find a way past the opposition defenders. Burst into life in the final half-an-hour or so and showed a lot of purpose during the crazy seven-minute spell. A precise delivery ensured an assist for Mason Greenwood before Rashford scored his side’s third. Has now scored in six successive games.</p>
      <h3>SUBSTITUTES</h3>
      <h4>Jesse Lingard: 7/10</h4>
      <p>A half-time substitution, Lingard slowly grew into the game and looked to make things happen. By full-time, he had created more chances than any player on the pitch (four), despite playing just 45 minutes. Might just be his best performance of the season.</p>
      <h4>Mason Greenwood: 8/10</h4>
      <p>Another Premier League appearance as a substitute. This time, he ended up breaking his duck in the Premier League with a fine close range finish. A goal that should boost his growing confidence further.</p>
      <h4>Axel Tuanzebe: N/A</h4>
      <p>On for the final few minutes, the primary purpose of his introduction was defeated when Oliver McBurnie netted the equaliser.</p>
