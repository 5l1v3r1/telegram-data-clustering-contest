      <p>Britain has agreed to take back 42 containers of plastic waste illegally exported to Malaysia, officials said Monday, as several Asian nations push back against becoming the world’s trash dump.</p>
      <p>Southeast Asia has been flooded with plastic from more developed nations such as the US and Australia since last year when China — which boasted a massive recycling industry — ordered a halt to imports.</p>
      <p>Many recycling businesses from China moved to Malaysia after the ban took effect, leaving officials struggling to return a large number of shipping containers full of waste brought in from abroad.</p>
      <p>After a visit by UK environment officials, Britain agreed to take back containers sent to a major port in northern Penang state since last year without the necessary import papers.</p>
      <p>Malaysian Environment Minister Yeo Bee Yin praised the “highly commendable” move by London.</p>
      <p>“This cooperation signifies a recognition that plastic pollution is a global issue which requires commitment from various countries to address the problem,” she said in a statement.</p>
      <p>British High Commissioner Charles Hay said the return of the containers showed the UK’s “commitment to fighting the illegal plastic waste trade”.</p>
      <p>Officials hope to take back all the containers by the end of the year, a Malaysian High Commission spokesman said.</p>
      <p>Several Southeast Asian countries have sent back unwanted waste in recent months. Indonesia has returned hundreds of containers to their countries of origin, while the Philippines returned a huge shipment of garbage to Canada.</p>
