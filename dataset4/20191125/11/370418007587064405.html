      <p>Last night, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/green-day/">Green Day</a> were welcomed onstage at the American Music Awards by pop megastar Billie Eilish, ahead of the band’s two-song performance at the ceremony.</p>
      <p>Billed as a celebration of the 25th anniversary of their breakthrough third record Dookie, the punk rock titans were at the awards show to perform recent single Father Of All…, as well as legendary 1994 hit Basket Case. And they were introduced by huge Green Day fan Billie, who praised the band for the impact they had on both her and her brother, Finneas.</p>
      <p>“So 25 years ago, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/billie-joe-armstrong/">Billie Joe Armstrong</a>, Mike Dirnt and Tré Cool recorded their iconic album Dookie,” she said. “Growing up, there was no band more important to me or my brother. So celebrating Dookie and their new single Father Of All…, please welcome Green Day!”</p>

      <p>Of course, this isn’t the first time Green Day and Billie Eilish’s paths have crossed. In fact, in a <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/billie-joe-armstrong-on-the-success-of-dookie-i-remember-being-pretty-freaked-out/">recent interview</a> for Rolling Stone, the pair chatted at length about Dookie, and how the frontman was maybe too young to enjoy the band’s success at the time.</p>
      <p>“Gosh. I was only 22,” Billie Joe told Billie Eilish. “I had a kid at the same time, and I was married. So it was a crazy year. I remember being pretty freaked out. I was playing a kind of music that had never been on that kind of scale before. But what I really wanted to do was keep working, and keep writing songs. I never wanted to feel like I was taking advantage of the situation. I didn’t really stop and smell the roses. Later on, I was kind of like, ‘Did I enjoy myself enough? Was that fun?’ Because the feeling of when you first get popular as a musician, that never happens twice. After that, you have to keep creating new stuff to keep things interesting in your life.”</p>
      <p>Billie Eilish then asked BJA if he even enjoyed the time period, to which he responded: “Not all the time. I was sort of lost at sea. There’s extreme highs, and you’re playing to a new audience really excited to hear you. But I think what was really important to me was being real. I think I worried about that too much, the part where you’re thinking, ‘I need to stay rooted at all costs.’ Sometimes I would get very hardheaded about that. And the record after that, Insomniac, was a really dark record. I was pretty numb to everything.”</p>
