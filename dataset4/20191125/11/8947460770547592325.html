      <p>The 2019 LA Auto Show kicked off last week and as always, we were on site capturing the latest and greatest news from the BMW and MINI brands. Our coverage can be <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/tag/2019-la-auto-show/">found here</a>, and of course on our <a href="http://www.instagram.com/bmwblog">Instagram</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/bmwblog">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/bmwblog?sub_confirmation=1">Youtube</a> channels. One of the pieces of content we captured on our Youtube channel was an interview and a design walkthrough with Domagoj Dukec, the recently appointed head of BMW design. Dukec has been featured before on BMWBLOG so it’s always great to hear him speak about the latest BMW design trends. The two models featured in this video are the BMW M2 CS and the M8 Gran Coupe, the latest M cars to join the sports family.</p>
      <p>These are also some of the last non-polarizing designs from M, with the rumored <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/22/m-boss-confirms-2021-bmw-m3-m4-will-differentiate-very-much-from-base-models/">2021 BMW M3 and M4</a> going into a different direction. It’s also fair to say that the BMW M2 CS is currently the darling of the BMW community, one of the most highly awaited cars of 2020. Despite its high price tag – 95,000 euros in Germany – the BMW M2 CS is likely to be a hit. And the design has something to do with that as well.</p>
      <h3>BMW M2 CS Design</h3>

      <p>Based on the BMW M2 Competition, the M2 CS adds a few visual touches that brings its level of sportiness to another level. At the front,  it gains a carbon fiber splitter for additional downforce, as well as a carbon fiber vented hood. The new hood not only lowers the weight of the car, but it also brings functional cooling into play.</p>
      <p>From the side, one could immediately spot the carbon fiber side mirror caps, as well as a new set of wheels painted in gold. You can see behind them the optional carbon ceramic brake system which also features yellow calipers. Moving to the back of the M2 CS, you could easily see that this is a special model. The carbon fiber trunk lip and the carbon fiber diffuser remind us of the sports DNA of this car. Last but not least important visual upgrade of the BMW M2 CS is the carbon fiber roof with a honeycomb design.</p>
      <p>Overall, the BMW M2 CS’ design is balanced, aggressive and eye-pleasing, so it certainly scores in the looks department.</p>
      <h3>BMW M8 Gran Coupe Design</h3>

      <p>Equally eye-catching is the BMW M8 Gran Coupe, in the First Edition variant. Only 400 of the First Edition models will be made and a numbered plaque will show their owners just how rare they are. The BMW kidney grille, side air breather trim, door mirror and window-surround trim, exterior badging and door sill plates are finished in Gold Bronze, mirroring the M8 Gran Coupe Concept vehicle. Exclusive 20-inch Forged M Star-Spoke wheels finished in Gold Bronze help set the BMW M8 Gran Coupe First Edition cars apart.</p>
      <p>As Dukec points out, the BMW M8 Gran Coupe First Edition retains the yellow daylights of the concept car which turn white while driving so the car can be road legal. The BMW Head of Design also says that future M cars could also get a similar headlights treatment.</p>
      <p>Without any further ado, let’s take a look at the video below and don’t forget to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/bmwblog?sub_confirmation=1">subscribe to our Youtube channel</a>:</p>
