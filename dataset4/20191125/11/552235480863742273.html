      <h1>The alarming Hearts stat that proves relegation is a real danger this season</h1>
      <h2>The 3-0 weekend battering at Kilmarnock means goal difference is the only thing keeping the Jambos off the bottom</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:14:18+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:14</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Pilcher, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-pilcher/</a></address>
      <p>Hearts’ “strongest squad for years” has accumulated the same number of points over the same number of games as the one that was relegated in 2013/14.</p>
      <p>It’s a sobering stat as the club’s search for a new manager enter it’s fifth week, off the back of a dreadful display against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a> at the weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/austin-macphee-rant-full-hearts-20937097">Austin MaPhee's impassioned defence</a> of his club, players and himself on Friday was better than anything his back four managed in the opening 16 minutes at Rugby Park as they found themselves 3-0 down and in danger of a real hammering.</p>
      <p>As tends to happen, there was no further scoring after Killie took their foot off the gas. As much as the previous 5-2 win over St Mirren did MacPhee’s chances of making his interim position permanent no harm, Saturday certainly did. He insists otherwise, and is due to meet with Ann Budge this week in that regard.</p>
      <p>The bigger picture isn’t a pretty one. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> are only not bottom of the table on goal difference, level on points with St Johnstone, Hamilton and St Mirren.</p>
      <p>11 from 13 games is objectively relegation form, and Hearts should know it.</p>

      <p>Club ambassador Gary Locke can tell them if they don’t. He was at the helm six years ago when the Tynecastle side last dropped out of the top division, but had an avalanche of mitigating circumstances by comparison.</p>
      <p>The club was in administration after years of financial mismanagement under the stewardship of Vladimir Romanov and were hit with a 15 point deduction at the start of the 2013-14 campaign, with a transfer embargo still in place.</p>
      <p>An extremely inexperienced squad was forced to rely heavily on older heads such as Ryan Stevenson, Jamie Hammill and Jamie MacDonald in what seemed an impossible task of avoiding the drop after 31 consecutive seasons in the top flight.</p>
      <p>That being the case, Hearts' start to the season was decent. A narrow defeat at St Johnstone was followed by an always welcome derby win over Hibs at Tynecastle, a draw at Partick Thistle and then a late win over Aberdeen.</p>
      <p>Of course inexperience and lack of options began to take their toll and the Jambos took just one point from their next eight games before beating Aberdeen once more, this time 3-1 at Pittodrie.</p>
      <p>11 points in the circumstances was encouraging. 11 points form the game number of games this season, especially with one less win that the class of 2013/14, is not.</p>
      <p>A comparison of the teams that started their respective 13th league fixtures illustrates how little excuse there is for the current crop, even taking injuries in to account.</p>

      <p>A teenage Callum Paterson led the line for Hearts away to the Dons in November 2013 with a 17-year-old Jordan McGhee at right back. None of Kevin McHattie, Dylan McGowan, Danny Wilson, Scott Robinson, Jason Holt or Jamie Walker (now a key player) were over 21.</p>
      <p>Compare that to the side that was blown away in Ayrshire at the weekend. It included four full internationals in the form of Michael Smith, Christophe Berra, Glenn Whelan and Steven Naismith, all in their 30s. Aside from 17-year-old Aaron Hickey, goalkeeper Joel Pereira was the only payer under the age of 24.</p>
      <p>Smith said afterwards that the mentality of the team wasn’t right and that he and his teammates must realise Hearts are “in a scrap” at the bottom of the league.</p>
      <p>There should be more than enough quality in the Tynecastle dressing room to ensure they get out of it. The issue is that they even find themselves in one in the first place.</p>
