      <p><a href="https://lailasnews.com/forbes-worlds-highest-paid-women-in-music-2019-taylor-swift-tops-the-list-see-full-list/">Taylor Swift</a> has just broken an age-long record at the American Music Awards after beating the late Michael Jackson to be decorated as the most-awarded artist in the history of the award.</p>
      <p>She is now the most decorated artist in AMA history on a night where she celebrated victory over her former record label who appeared to attempt to block her performing her classic hits.</p>

      <p>The megastar now has 29 awards to her name, overtaking MJ’s 24-award haul before the night was even half way through.</p>
      <p>She claimed not only Artist of the Year and Artist of the Decade, but Favourite Pop/Rock Album for Lover and Favourite Female Artist as well.</p>
      <p>When it came to Favorite Album – Pop/Rock, Swift’s Lover beat out Billie Eilish’s When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? and Ariana Grande’s Thank U, Next, and the singer could hardly believe it.</p>
      <blockquote>“This is amazing,” she said while holding her trophy, stunned. “That was a really tough category… I didn’t think I was gonna win this one.”</blockquote>

      <p>While she didn’t mention her record-breaking accomplishment, she did thank her new record label, which many took as a subtle dig at her former label, Big Machine, following their high-profile feud, <i>Yahoo News </i>reports.</p>
      <blockquote>“I really love my record label, Universal Republic. Thank you for being so generous and letting me make whatever music I want to make,” Swift said, excitedly.</blockquote>
