        <b>Being sold in China as Mi CC9 Pro, the Mi Note 10 currently shares the top spot in DxOMark's chart for smartphone photography with Huawei Mate 30 Pro, beating Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, Samsung Galaxy Note10+ and Google Pixel 4</b>

      <p>Xiaomi will launch the Mi Note 10, its first 108MP camera smartphone, in India soon. Xiaomi's India head Manu Kumar Jain posted a couple of tweets on Monday indicating that the Chinese tech giant is planning to bring a phone with 108MP camera to India.</p>
      <p>In the first of his two tweets on Monday, Jain posted '108' written in camera emojis accompanied by "IT'S COMING #108MP". The second tweet had "#108MP" surrounded by index finger pointing emojis.</p>
      <p>As of now, the only Xiaomi phone with a 108MP camera is the Mi Note 10, the rebranded version of Mi CC9 Pro for global markets, which means it is the device Jain is referring to in his tweets. The posts do not mention the timeframe of launch, though.</p>
