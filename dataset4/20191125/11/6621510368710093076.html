      <p><b>ISLAMABAD:</b> Federal Minister for Railways Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad on Monday said that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI) would successfully come out from ongoing foreign funding case in the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).</p>
      <p>Addressing a press conference, Rasheed said that the Mainline 1 (ML1) project was a key project in the belt of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and would soon be completed.</p>
      <p>“The credit of completing this project goes to Prime Minister Imran Khan,” he said.</p>
      <p>Hailing the Chinese railway infrastructure as one of the best in the world, the minister said that talks were also underway to initiate the Mainline 2 (ML2) project.</p>
      <p>Rasheed said that the incumbent federal government would complete its tenure and he was not foreseeing any elections in the near future.</p>
      <p>He also demanded scrutiny into foreign funding sources of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan People’s Party (PPP).</p>
      <p>He also claimed that a plea bargain was also underway in cases that involved PPP Co-chairman Asif Zardari. “Soon a lot of money will be deposited in the national exchequer from National Accountability Burau (NAB) authorities,” Rasheed said.</p>
      <p>Sheikh Rasheed also demanded to investigate Nawaz Sharif’s personal physician Dr Adnan and head of medical board treating PML-N supremo, Dr Waqar, for “fooling masses”.</p>
      <p>“It is our success that Moulana returned empty-handed after bringing his supporters to Islamabad, demanding the resignation of the prime minister,” he said.</p>
      <p>Also rubbishing aside any difference of PML-Q leader Pervaiz Elahi with the incumbent government, the APML chief said that Elahi was part of the system and contacted Fazl on the request of Imran Khan.</p>
