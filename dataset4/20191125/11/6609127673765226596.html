        <b>COPS are investigating after a perv was seen masturbating in front of two teenage women on a Glasgow city centre street.</b>
      </p>
      <p>At around 7.45pm last Monday night, the two women, aged 17 and 18, saw the creep carrying out an "indecent act" on Clyde Street, near it's junction with Dunlop Street.</p>

        <figcaption>The man was seen masturbating on the street</figcaption>

      <p>The man is described as white, aged 30 to 40, between 5ft7in and 5ft9in, and of medium build.</p>
      <p>He was wearing a grey hooded top and a khaki jacket with jeans.</p>
      <p>Cops say it is vital the man is traced and are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.</p>
      <p>Detective Constable Vhairi Mills said: “This is a very busy area and I am sure that there are people who witnesses this incident.</p>
      <p>"He must be traced and I would urge anyone who saw this man in the Clyde Street area of who has information that will assist this ongoing investigation to please contact City Centre Police Office through 101 quoting reference number 3471 of 18th November.</p>
      <p>"Alternatively Crimestoppers can be contacted on 0800 555 111, where anonymity can be maintained."</p>
      <p>We told how cops were called out after a <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4985635/male-stripper-penis-bute-pub-dancer-sausage-party/">male stripper's manhood popped out</a> - at a raunchy event an Isle of Bute pub had dubbed its “Sausage Party”.</p>
      <p>A shocked punter landed the boozer in trouble by making a formal complaint about the fleeting flash of todger.</p>
      <p>But bosses at the Scottish Honky Tonk in Ardbeg on the Firth of Clyde island blamed the incident on a costume cock-up.</p>
      <p>And a serial flasher has been caught <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4981260/edinburgh-mcdonalds-flasher-ryan-dolan/">exposing himself to Edinburgh McDonald's staff</a> - just a year after performing "helicopter-like moves" with his genitals in the same restaurant.</p>
      <p>Shameless Ryan Dolan, 30, flashed his tackle at shocked workers and members of the public as he stood outside the capital's South St Andrew Street branch.</p>
      <p>Dolan banged on the window to get everyone's attention before dropping his trousers for a full 18 seconds at around 5am on July 27 this year.</p>
      <p>Staff said he then ran away.</p>
