      <p>Newcastle United manager Steve Bruce has shelved plans to release his autobiography in order to concentrate on his role as Magpies boss.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Bruce</a> had planned to release his autobiography Steve Bruce: Theatre of Dreams - playing, managing and everything in between in October, but the release date has been pushed back so he can concentrate on his role at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/st-james-park">St James' Park.</a></p>
      <p>The book is still available to pre-order on several bookselling sites including Amazon, WHSmith and Waterstones but its publication has been postponed indefinitely.</p>

      <p>“I’ve put it on hold,” Bruce said.</p>
      <p>“I just don’t have time any more. I’ve done a few little things for it, but that’s on the back-burner now.</p>
      <p>"It was obviously very difficult to find any time when I was coming up and down the motorway to see my mam and dad and it wouldn’t be right to do it now. What happens at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-afc">Newcastle</a> might be worth a chapter or two anyway!”</p>
