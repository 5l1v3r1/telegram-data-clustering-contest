      <p>The current Leicester City manager won eight out of eight trophies before jumping at the chance to join the Foxes in late February of this year.</p>
      <p>Allardyce believes similar success can be achieved by any boss going to either half of the Old Firm as he expects Steven Gerrard to soon do the same at Rangers.</p>
      <p>He told talkSPORT: "We can all go to Celtic and win trophies.</p>
      <p>"It will be Rangers soon the way they are going under Steven Gerrard .</p>
      <p>"Fans expect you to win trophies and if you don't do that then you'd get the sack."</p>
