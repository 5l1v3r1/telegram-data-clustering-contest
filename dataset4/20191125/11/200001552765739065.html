      <h1>Player asked why Chelsea transfer collapsed after father claimed ‘signing was done’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:33:59+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/naveen-ullal/" target="_blank">Naveen Ullal</a></address>
      <p>Joaquín came up through the ranks of Real Betis’ academy before making his way into their first team in 2000.</p>
      <p>He left them for Valencia in 2006 and after having spent nine years away from the Seville side, he returned to Betis in 2015.</p>
      <p>Last October, the winger’s father Aurelio Sánchez revealed his son came close to joining Chelsea in 2006 after the Blues had agreed a fee and also personal terms with the player.</p>
      <p><i>“The signing for Chelsea was done. Betis would receive €36m plus another €3m for a friendly, €6m per season for Joaquin, who would sign five years. I would take €3m and Jorge Mendes €3m for the operation,”</i> Sánchez told <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/signing-chelsea-done-players-father-e36m-transfer-went-wrong/">El Español</a> in 2018.</p>
      <p>The player was in Madrid at the time and his father advised him to take a flight to Seville to sign the contract, but he decided against doing so because he was happy at Betis.</p>
      <p><a href="http://as.com/">AS</a> asked Joaquín about the comments made by his father regarding a ‘dizzying’ offer from Chelsea for his transfer in 2006.</p>

      <p>Responding to that, he said: <i>“My love for Betis deprived me of many things, perhaps. I don’t even remember Chelsea.”</i></p>
      <p>Joaquín continues to be important at Betis, scoring at the weekend in their victory over Valencia.</p>
