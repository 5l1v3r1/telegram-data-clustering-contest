      <p>Cape Town - <b>Karmichael Hunt</b> is set to play his second campaign in sky blue after the <b>Waratahs</b> confirmed they had re-signed him for the 2020 season.</p>
      <p>Hunt - who joined the Waratahs at the start of the 2019 Super Rugby season - was an integral part of the side’s backline and attack, before his season was cruelly cut short through injury.</p>
      <p>Named the Back of the Year for 2019, Hunt also finished at the pointy end of Matt Burke Cup voting after a stellar campaign.</p>
      <p>He missed the National Rugby Championship (NRC) to focus on rehabilitating the knee injury that ended his Super Rugby season, and will start the 2020 pre-season fit and firing.</p>
      <p>Waratahs head coach Rob Penney said Hunt had been a strong performer last season and would be an important signing for 2020.</p>
      <p>“Everyone I’ve spoken to can’t speak highly enough of Karmichael, his attitude, professionalism and experience will be extremely valuable this season,” Penney said.</p>
      <p>“He’s a supremely talented athlete and from all reports, sets the example for our younger guys in the way he goes about his business, looks after his body and prepares for games.</p>
      <p>“We’ve all seen what Karmichael’s capable of across what’s been an illustrious career, he brought that to the Waratahs in 2019 and will again play a vital role in the midfield next season.</p>
      <p>“He’s a player I’m really looking forward to working with and I’m pleased he’s remaining a Waratah for another season.”</p>
      <p>Hunt was thankful to remain a Waratah after making his club debut in 2019.</p>
      <p>“I’m grateful for the opportunity the Waratahs gave me to play Super Rugby (in 2019) and the care and support provided by my team-mates and everyone within the organisation,” he said.</p>
      <p>“My family and I are happy in New South Wales and the environment at the Waratahs is a huge part of that, it’s a place that’s been great for me both professionally and personally.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got a good young squad of guys that I’m looking forward to playing alongside, sharing some of my experiences with and contributing to their development (in 2020).</p>
      <p>“Next season is a new challenge for all of us, it’s exciting and I can’t wait to get started.”</p>
