      <h1>Trial underway for driver charged in Saanich crash that left girl with brain damage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:06:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:06</time> by <a rel="author">Louise Dickson</a></address>
      <p>Julia Fellman was driving along Ash Road on the morning of Dec. 20, 2017, when the driver of a black Mercedes SUV passed her at a speed she estimated was more than 80 km an hour.</p>
      <p>The vice-principal of Hillcrest Elementary was so surprised, she looked down at her own speedometer to check her speed.</p>
      <p>“I was going 50,” Fellman testified Monday on the first day of Tenessa Nikirk’s trial in Victoria provincial court. Nikirk is charged with dangerous driving causing bodily harm. “And the SUV appeared to be going faster and faster as it accelerated away from me.”</p>
      <p>Nikirk was behind the wheel of the black Mercedes that struck 11-year-old Leila Bui at the intersection of Ash Road and Torquay Drive. Leila received catastrophic injuries including brain damage, a fractured neck and a lacerated spleen.</p>
      <p>Fellman testified that she watched the black SUV disappear over the crest of the hill.</p>
      <p>“When I got to the top of the hill, I saw the black SUV had stopped. There were about four vehicles stopped at the crosswalk and on the opposite side I saw the top of the head of what looked like a small person or a child beside the second car,” Fellman said.</p>
      <p>The car doors opened and drivers got out and went toward the child lying in the road, Fellman recalled. She realized there was a line of cars behind her and turned onto Torquay. She drove to school, calling police as soon as she got there.</p>
      <p>Fellman has a dash cam on both the front and back of her car and court was able to watch video of a black SUV overtaking her.</p>
      <p>The Crown’s theory is that Nikirk showed a pattern of dangerous driving on that cold, icy morning, said prosecutor Jess Patterson.</p>
      <p>Admissions of fact, read into the court record, show that between 8 and 8:20 a.m., Nikirk sent 11 text messages and received 13 texts from a 604 number. Leila was hit between 8:15 and 8:16 a.m.</p>
      <p>Patterson expects the evidence will show Nikirk overtook Fellman’s car and another car on Ash Road. Nikirk passed the cars on a solid yellow line, which is legal.</p>
      <p>“But given the conditions and the fact the evidence will show she exceeded the speed limit to some degree, that’s not legal,” Patterson said.</p>
      <p>The evidence will show that Leila was thrown quite a distance.</p>
      <p>Expert witnesses and collision analysts are expected to testify about the speed the black Mercedes was going.</p>
      <p>Defence lawyer Tom Morino asked Judge Mayland McKimm to consider going to the scene.</p>
      <p>“In 32 years, I’ve never asked the court to do that, but it is important that the court see the site for themselves,” Morino said.</p>
      <p>Leila’s parents, Kairry and Tuan Bui, were sitting in the back row of the courtroom Monday.</p>
