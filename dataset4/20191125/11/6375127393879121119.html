      <h3>THE Department of Health (DOH) yesterday confirmed another polio case in the country.</h3>
      <p>The DOH said a 9-year-old girl from Basilan  is the latest victim of polio, bringing the total polio cases to eight.</p>
      <p>Samples sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases – Japan came out positive for poliovirus.  </p>
      <p>The girl from Basilan did not receive any vaccines for polio.  </p>
      <p>The Health Department is currently coordinating with the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao – Ministry of Health to maximize immunization coverage and intensify polio vaccination efforts in Basilan.  </p>
      <p>Health Secretary Francisco Duque III assured sufficient stocks of oral polio vaccine. He said preparations for outbreak response immunization are underway.</p>
      <p>The DoH reminded the public of the next round of “Sabayang Patak Kontra Polio” from November 25 to December 7 in the National Capital Region and the whole of Mindanao.<br/>All children under five years of age, regardless of immunization status, will receive a dose of the oral polio vaccine during the campaign.</p>
      <p>“I urge all parents and caregivers of children under five years old to take part in the ‘Sabayang Patak Kontra Polio’ campaign and have their children vaccinated by our health workers,” Duque said.</p>
      <p>Health workers and vaccination teams are set to go house-to-house to ensure that all children aged five and below are vaccinated.</p>
      <p>Health centers, government hospitals, vaccination posts in barangays, malls, terminals, and fast food chains,  will also be providing vaccination.</p>
      <p>“We are thankful for the participation and continued support of our local government units and communities in the campaign. I am confident that we will be successful in halting the outbreak if we continue to work together and make sure that no child is left unvaccinated,” the Health Secretary said.</p>
