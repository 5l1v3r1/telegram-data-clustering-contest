      <p>EE will end its free Nintendo Switch giveaway just days before Black Friday begins.</p>
      <p>The network provider launched the eye-catching Black Friday deal at the beginning of November as part of an early Black Friday sale but the deal itself will not last to the day itself on 29 November.</p>
