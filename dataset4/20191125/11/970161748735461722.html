      <p>We love a nifty hack, especially when it can be done at a bargain.</p>
      <p>A trick on how to remove rust has resurfaced in the Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ExtremeCouponingAndBargainsUK/">Extreme Couponing and Bargains UK</a>, and people are loving the throwback hack.</p>
      <p>Laura Siârn Outhart from Malton, North Yorkshire, shared a post with details on how a 29p pack of paracetamol was the secret to not having to buy a new iron, when hers became rusty.</p>
      <p>She rubbed the paracetamol on the dirty surface of the iron, and like magic, the rust disappeared.</p>
      <p>Laura included before and after photos of the transformation, and captioned the post: ‘A 29p pack of Paracetamols saved me buying a new iron. I am a nightmare for ironing things I shouldn’t and recently ruined my iron.</p>
      <p>‘I read somewhere that a Paracetamol rubbed onto the iron will make it almost like new again.’</p>

      <p>This particular hack has been around for years, but it’s a beloved favourite that keeps coming back time and time again (because it works).</p>
      <p>If you’re considering doing it yourself, here’s how to do it:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Plug the rusty iron in and put it on maximum heat.</li>
        <li>Once it’s hot, grab a paracetamol tablet with tweezers (not your hands, as you could burn your fingers) and rub it onto the rusty area.</li>
        <li>Depending on the level of the stain, you might need to repeat the process with a second tablet.</li>
        <li>Once you’re done, whipe it clean with a cloth (while the iron is still hot, but once again, be careful with the fingers).</li>
        <li>Turn the iron off and marvel at the good as new surface.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Laura’s iron stain was quite stubborn, meaning she had to use two tablets.</p>
      <p>‘This took two paracetamols and it worked better when the iron was hot and not just warm,’ she added.</p>
      <p>‘I was amazed how well it worked and how much money it saved me.</p>
      <p>‘To anyone asking, I didn’t wet the tablet before hand and if you use tweezers and are very careful then you won’t get burnt.</p>
      <p>‘I am not saying do this, but it worked for me and saved me buying a new iron. I tried other alternatives but this one worked in seconds and the other ways either didn’t work or it took too long and I would give up.’</p>
      <p>The post has since gone viral, racking up close to 6,000 likes and 1,700 comments.</p>

      <p>Some of the people in the Facebook group also tried the trick for themselves and thanked Laura for sharing it.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve just seen this post and tried it and it works nice shiny iron again thank you,’ wrote one person.</p>
      <p>‘Thanks! This is a great life hack that I’ll be using in the near future,’ said someone else.</p>
      <p>One person said Laura’s hack had come just in time, as she had been planning to buy a new iron the day before seeing the post.</p>
      <p>‘So glad you posted this I was off out to buy a new one tomorrow but will try this first,’ they wrote.</p>
