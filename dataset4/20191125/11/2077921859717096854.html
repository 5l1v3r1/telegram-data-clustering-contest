      <h1>New Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker Clip Shows Rey, Poe and Finn on the Run</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:17:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:17</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Singh  </a></address>
      <p><i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> is due in theaters in less than a month, and to up the already sky-high anticipation, Disney/Lucasfilm has released a clip of Rey, Poe, Finn and friends reunited and on the run.</p>
      <p>The gang of Resistance fighters are jetting across a desert landscape when they’re spotted by a group of stormtroopers, who subsequently pursue them. Rey finds herself in a flight-and-fight situation where she shoots red lasers at the stormtroopers while trying not to singe Chewbacca’s fur off. The Empire seems to be eating their dust until a new trick stuns C-3PO and the rest. The clip ends before we get to see the result of this chase, so we’ll just have to wait until Dec. 20—or whenever you manage to get tickets—to see if and how they escape the Empire’s grasp.</p>
      <p>Watch the clip below and check out the film’s latest trailer <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/10/new-the-rise-of-skywalker-trailer-is-electric-with.html">here</a>.</p>
