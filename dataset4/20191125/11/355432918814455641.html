      <p>Former New York City Mayor <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/michael-bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a></b> made his 2020 intentions official on Sunday, kicking off his White House bid as the ever-changing Democratic primary took yet another major turn. </p>
      <p>Bloomberg’s announcement came in the form of a two-minute video, pitching himself as an experienced hand in government, business and philanthropy and the necessary antidote to <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a></b>, who he argued poses an “existential threat” to the country. </p>
      <p><i>"We cannot afford four more years of President Trump’s reckless and unethical actions," </i>Bloomberg said in a statement. <i>"He represents an existential threat to our country and our values. If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage" </i>(<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/471827-bloomberg-drops-first-tv-ad-announcing-presidential-run">The Hill</a>). </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-2020-presidency.html">The New York Times</a>: Michael Bloomberg joins 2020 Democratic field for president.</p>
      <p><a href="https://apnews.com/d95e83223e034dfda663c917ca6f8509">The Associated Press</a>: Bloomberg entry into presidential race raises ethics issues.</p>
      <p>More than anything, Bloomberg brings a financial might to the race that has perhaps never been seen on the national level. With his net worth sitting at $53 billion, putting him among the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/richest-people-in-world-forbes/13/">10 richest individuals</a> in the world, Bloomberg’s spending gives him an advantage that he is trying to use from the outset. Prior to his launch, Bloomberg’s team reserved north of $30 million in ads across most of the country starting Monday, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/22/michael-bloomberg-ad-buy-2020-election-072893">one of the largest</a> buys of all time (if not the largest). </p>
      <p>In addition, Bloomberg has launched a $100 million ad campaign to criticize Trump and a $15 million voter registration drive across a group of key battleground states. As <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mike-bloomberg-enters-democratic-campaign-for-president/2019/11/24/4519cd70-0e23-11ea-bd9d-c628fd48b3a0_story.html">The Washington Post</a> notes, the spending plans amount to double the total amount raised by Sen. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a></b> (I-Vt.) through the end of the third fundraising quarter.  </p>
      <p>Bloomberg also announced that, like his mayoral contests, he will forgo receiving campaign contributions and, as the previously revealed spending indicated, will self-fund his bid. </p>
      <p>However, with his entrance come attacks from the progressive wing of the Democratic Party that has seethed at what it perceives as greedy billionaires who try to buy elections. Shortly after his announcement, Sanders and Sen.<b> <a href="https://thehill.com/people/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a></b> (D-Mass.) teed off on his candidacy, with the Vermont senator predicting that Bloomberg won’t “get very far” in 2020 (<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/in-michael-bloomberg-elizabeth-warren-has-finally-found-a-2020-dem-to-attack">The Daily Beast</a>). </p>
      <p><i>"We do not believe that billionaires have the right to buy elections, and that is why we are going to overturn Citizens United. That is why multi-billionaires like Mr. Bloomberg are not going to get very far in this election. That is why we are going to end voter suppression in America,"</i> Sanders said at a town hall in New Hampshire (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/24/politics/2020-democrats-reaction-michael-bloomberg-bernie-sanders/index.html">CNN</a>). </p>
      <p>Adding another layer to Bloomberg’s bid is what becomes of Bloomberg News and its campaign coverage of its owner and the Democratic field. In an email to staff, the outlet’s editor-in-chief, <b>John Micklethwait,</b> laid out its plan, revealing that while it will report on the campaign like others in the Democratic field, it will not do any investigative work into Bloomberg or his primary competitors (<a href="https://twitter.com/oliverdarcy/status/1198638671374761985">CNN</a>).</p>

        <u>LEADING THE DAY</u>
      </p>
      <p><b>IMPEACHMENT WATCH: </b>For two months, the House impeachment inquiry has taken its toll on Capitol Hill. Looking ahead, it’s also going to do so on the campaign trail as it threatens to overshadow the early primary contests and force up to six candidates away from voters in those states as they deal with a possible Senate trial.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/the-memo/471757-the-memo-impeachment-overshadows-2020-race-for-democrats">Niall Stanage writes in his latest memo</a> about the impact of the impeachment proceedings on the 2020 race and points out a problem that has grown since the inquiry launched in late September: The oxygen for 2020 candidates is limited. </p>
      <p>While the top contenders have kept their footing through impeachment, mid- and bottom-tier candidates have found it increasingly difficult to break through, with the exception of South Bend, Ind., Mayor <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/peter-pete-buttigieg">Pete Buttigieg</a></b>, who has found himself atop recent polls in Iowa and New Hampshire. The ratings for the debates are one example of this phenomenon as the first debate in June pulled in over 18 million viewers. However, the fifth debate, which took place last week in Atlanta, attracted only 6.6 million viewers. </p>
      <p>For those senators, the problem becomes compounded, as they could miss about a month of valuable face-to-face time with voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Making matters worse, those candidates are unlikely to receive help from their Senate Democratic colleagues, according to <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/471749-impeachment-trial-throws-curveball-into-2020-race">The Hill’s Jordain Carney</a>. </p>
      <p>With a trial expected to start as early as January, that would put the Senate proceeding in the immediate run-up to the batch of early contests. </p>

      <p><b>&gt; Intel Committee heads: </b>Rep. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/devin-nunes">Devin Nunes</a></b> (R-Calif.), the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee denied on Sunday that he met with ex-Ukrainian prosecutor general <b>Viktor Shokin</b> in Vienna last year, but declined to elaborate or offer any further details.  </p>
      <p>Nunes made the denial during an interview on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” pushing back on an allegation made by the attorney for <b>Lev Parnas</b>, an associate of <a href="https://thehill.com/people/rudy-giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a>, that Nunes met with Shokin as part of a push for information about former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> and his son Hunter Biden. </p>
      <p><i>“I really want to answer all of these questions, and I promise you I absolutely will come back on the show … but I think you can understand that I can’t compete by trying to debate this out with the public media when 90 percent of the media are totally corrupt,” </i>Nunes told host <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/maria-bartiromo">Maria Bartiromo</a> </b>(<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/nunes-denies-allegation-he-met-with-top-ukrainian-prosecutor-about-bidens/2019/11/24/34644688-0edf-11ea-bf62-eadd5d11f559_story.html">The Washington Post</a>). </p>

      <p>On the other side of the aisle, House Intelligence Committee Chairman <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/adam-schiff">Adam Schiff</a> </b>(D-Calif.) told CNN’s “State of the Union” that the panel will move forward with it’s forthcoming impeachment report despite the lack of testimony from multiple key potential witnesses.</p>
      <p>The revelation from Schiff is another sign that House Democrats are rolling right along with their inquiry and not waiting on their testimony, arguing that the evidence against Trump is “already overwhelming.”  </p>
      <p><i>“Yes, we’d love to have these witnesses come in,”</i> Schiff said. <i>“But we’re not willing to simply allow them to wait us out — to stall this proceeding — when the facts are already overwhelming” </i>(<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/schiff-says-democrats-will-press-forward-despite-lack-of-testimony-from-key-impeachment-witnesses/2019/11/24/913ed910-0ec4-11ea-bf62-eadd5d11f559_story.html">The Washington Post</a>). </p>

        <u>IN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES</u>
      </p>
      <p><b>MORE CONGRESS: </b>Congress is barreling toward a chaotic end-of-the-year scramble. Lawmakers have only have 15 working days to wrap up key legislative items, headlined by the ongoing push to fund the government as the impeachment effort continues to headline the work on Capitol Hill. </p>
      <p>The House and Senate are technically scheduled to leave by Dec. 13, but members are already planning to be in town into late December as they try to wrap up their work prior to leaving town for the Christmas break.  </p>
      <p>Top appropriators took a big step toward a resolution on Friday as they agreed on top-line spending figures for the fiscal 2020 bills. The agreement marks a breakthrough in negotiations to fund the government and comes after days of behind-the-scenes haggling between Senate Republicans and House Democrats in search of a deal.  </p>
      <p>In order to prevent a government shutdown, lawmakers will need to pass either the fiscal 2020 bills or another stopgap spending measure by Dec. 20 (<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/471791-house-senate-reach-deal-on-fiscal-2020-spending-figures">The Hill</a>). </p>
      <p><b>&gt; Stefanik rising: </b>Long touted as a future star for the party, Rep. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/elise-stefanik">Elise Stefanik</a></b> (R-N.Y.) has taken the role of a chief defender for the president as the GOP continues to grapple with the House impeachment inquiry, launching her into the national spotlight in recent weeks. </p>
      <p>While her profile continues to be on helium watch, House Democrats are hoping that her proximity to Trump helps their side politically and makes her a possible target on the House map in 2020 (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/471755-rising-gop-star-thrust-into-spotlight-with-trump-defense">The Hill</a>).  </p>

      <p><b>WHITE HOUSE &amp; ADMINISTRATION: </b>Defense Secretary <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/mark-esper">Mark Esper</a></b> asked for the resignation of Navy Secretary <b>Richard Spencer</b> over his handling of a war crimes case involving <b>Eddie Gallagher</b>, a Navy SEAL who was also acquitted of murder in the same trial.</p>
      <p>Esper said in a statement Sunday that he was "deeply troubled" by reports that Spencer had reached out to White House officials promising that an accused Navy SEAL would be allowed to retire as a SEAL despite his conviction for posing with the corpse of a slain enemy combatant. </p>
      <p><i>"Unfortunately, as a result I have determined that Secretary Spencer no longer has my confidence to continue in his position,"</i> Esper said. <i>"I wish Richard well.”</i>  </p>
      <p>Spencer subsequently submitted his resignation later on Sunday, saying in a lengthy letter that he and the president disagreed on the nature of the rule of law.   </p>
      <p><i>"I cannot in good conscience obey an order that I believe violates the sacred oath I took in the presence of my family, my flag, and my faith,"</i> Spencer said. He did not specify which order from Trump he was referring to (<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/471854-defense-secretary-asks-for-navy-chiefs-resignation-over-seal-war-crimes-case">The Hill</a>).</p>

      <p>On Sunday evening, Trump weighed in on Spencer’s ouster, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1198746358091530241">tweeting</a> that he was terminated for not addressing “large cost overruns from past administration’s contracting procedures.”</p>
      <p><i>“I was not pleased with the way that Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher’s trial was handled by the Navy. He was treated very badly but, despite this, was completely exonerated on all major charges. I then restored Eddie’s rank. Likewise, large cost overruns from past administration’s contracting procedures were not addressed to my satisfaction,” </i>Trump said. <i>“Therefore, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer’s services have been terminated by Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. I thank Richard for his service &amp; commitment.” </i></p>
      <p>Trump added that U.S. Ambassador to Norway <b>Ken Braithwaite</b> will be nominated to replace Spencer.  </p>
