      <p>The Maharashtra Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Monday said it has closed probe into alleged irregularities in nine irrigation projects in Maharashtra, adding none of these cases was linked to deputy CM <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ajit-pawar">Ajit Pawar.</a></p>
      <p>The ACB's clarification came after opposition Congress claimed <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ajit-pawar">Ajit Pawar </a>was "exonerated" in lieu of his support to the BJP in forming a government two days ago.</p>
      <p>"None of the cases pertaining to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ajit-pawar">Ajit Pawar </a>in the 2013 irrigation scam investigation have been closed," a senior ACB official told PTI.</p>
