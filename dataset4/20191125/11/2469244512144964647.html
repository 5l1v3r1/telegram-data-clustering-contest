      <p>Police say an 88-year-old woman remains in a stable condition after she was hit by an ambulance in Exeter.</p>
      <p>Several police cars and paramedics were called to Cowley Bridge Road on Friday afternoon after an ambulance, which was responding to an emergency call, struck the elderly woman on the zebra crossing by the Esso petrol station.</p>
      <p>The road was initially closed in both directions causing long tailbacks between  <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/all-about/exeter">Exeter</a>  and the Crediton road.</p>
      <p>Police remained at the scene on the petrol station forecourt after the road reopened.</p>
