      <p>Rebellion announced today its acquisition of the iconic The Bitmap Brothers brand and portfolio. The Bitmap Brothers were responsible for what many regard as some of the stand-out games of the late 80s and early 90s, including titles such as Xenon, Z: Steel Soldiers, Speedball and Chaos Engine.</p>
      <p>As the press release reads, Rebellion plans to bring classic The Bitmap Brothers games to new platforms. Furthermore, it plans to create new titles based on its beloved licenses.</p>
      <p>Rebellion CEO and Co-founder Jason Kingsley OBE said:</p>
      <blockquote>“We’re delighted with the addition of The Bitmap Brothers to the ever-growing Rebellion portfolio. The Bitmap Brothers are renowned for making great games and for bringing gaming into the mainstream with inimitable style. We’ve known Mike Montgomery for many years, and we’re honoured by the faith and trust that he has shown in us by passing on the torch. We’ll strive to be vigilant custodians of one of gaming’s great names.”</blockquote>
