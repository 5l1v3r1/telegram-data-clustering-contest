      <p>Maurice Robinson has admitted plotting to assist illegal immigration and acquiring criminal property.</p>
      <p>Robinson, 25, appeared Monday at London's Central Criminal Court by video link from prison. He did not enter pleas to 39 counts of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people.</p>
      <p>Two other men have been arrested in connection with the case.</p>
