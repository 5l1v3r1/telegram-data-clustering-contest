        <b>Could they make their Worthy Farm debut next year?</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/twenty-one-pilots">Twenty One Pilots</a> have announced a Dublin arena show which is set to take place the day before <a href="https://www.nme.com/festivals/glastonbury">Glastonbury</a> 2020’s full music programme kicks off.</p>
      <p>The line-up for next year’s Worthy Farm festival has yet to be confirmed, although <a href="https://www.nme.com/festivals/glastonbury/paul-mccartney-confirms-glastonbury-slot-cryptic-twitter-post-2568890">Sir Paul McCartney has been confirmed as a headliner</a> and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/diana-ross-confirmed-legends-slot-glastonbury-2020-2555785">Diana Ross will fill the Sunday “legends slot”.</a></p>
      <p>Speculation over the two remaining headline spots and the remainder of the line-up remains rife, though, and the announcement today (November 25) of Twenty One Pilots’ Dublin show at the RDS Arena on June 25 will have fans of the band hoping that the Ohio duo will then make the short hop across the Irish Sea to join the <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/festivals-blog/glastonbury-2020-festival-dates-line-rumours-registering-tickets-beating-rush-2523006">Glastonbury 2020</a> line-up the following day.</p>
