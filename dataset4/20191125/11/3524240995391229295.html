      <h1>Soldiers rescue man, wife held by jihadists</h1>

      <p>Philippine soldiers on Monday rescued a British man and his wife from Islamic State-linked jihadists nearly two months after the couple were kidnapped from their beach resort in the nation’s south, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Troops recovered the pair after a firefight with gunmen from the Abu Sayyaf group on the restive southern island of Jolo, which is a stronghold of the kidnap-for-ransom gang that has been behind some of the worst attacks in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>“There was a brief exchange of fire, but they later abandoned the couple after being overwhelmed by pursuing government forces,” Lieutenant General Cirilito Sobejana told <i>AFP</i>.</p>
      <p>Regional army spokesman Arvin Encinas said no ransom was paid.</p>
      <p>British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab confirmed the rescue of the couple, saying “both Alan and Wilma Hyrons are safe and well, and being looked after by the Philippine authorities.”</p>
      <p>“We worked closely with the Government of the Philippines on Alan and Wilma’s case over the last two months,” he added in a statement.</p>
      <p>Armed men abducted the couple on October 4 at their beach resort on the southern island of Mindanao, which makes up the southern third of the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Muslim separatists have led a decades-long insurgency in the south of the Catholic-majority Philippines, which has led to the death of tens of thousands of people.</p>
      <p>While the government has negotiated peace with the largest group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, hardline factions allied with the Islamic State group are not part of the accord.</p>
      <p>IS claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing on a Sunday mass in January at a Catholic cathedral on Jolo which killed 21 in the country’s worst attack in years.</p>
      <p>Authorities blamed the bombing on Abu Sayyaf, which in part funds its violence with ransom payments.</p>
      <p>Dutch birdwatcher Ewold Horn, who was kidnapped in 2012 in the southern Philippines, was killed in May during a firefight between his Abu Sayyaf captors and the military.</p>
