      <h1>Packers vs. 49ers final score: San Francisco crushes Green Bay on Sunday night</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:53:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:53</time> by <a rel="author">James Crabtree-Hannigan</a></address>
      <p>The 49ers passed another test Sunday night with a 37-8beatdown of the Packers that helped them maintain a narrow lead atop the NFC West.</p>
      <p>Green Bay was just the latest team stymied by San Francisco's defense, which held quarterback Aaron Rodgers’ offense to 198 total yards and one score.</p>
      <p>On the fifth play of the game, San Francisco defensive end Fred Warner got to Rodgers in the pocket and forced a fumble, which Nick Bosa fell on at the Green Bay 2. Running back Tevin Coleman scored on the next play for an early 7-0 lead.</p>
      <p>Later, with the Packers unable to move the ball, San Francisco pulled away with 13 points in the final three minutes of the first half. A 41-yard catch-and-run touchdown from wide receiver Deebo Samuel was the highlight, one of two long TD passes from quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo on the night.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Garoppolo finished 14 for 20 for 253 yards through the air, with two scores and no interceptions. Rodgers had a respectable 20-for-33 completion mark but earned a paltry 104 yards on those completions.</p>
      <p>Green Bay got on the board late in the third quarter, only for San Francisco to answer emphatically. Niners tight end George Kittle broke wide open over the middle for a 61-yard score, which accounting for almost half of his 129 receiving yards.</p>
      <p>The second half was mercifully brief; each team had three possessions after halftime.</p>
      <p>The Packers' schedule eases up considerably going forward, with games against the Giants and Redskins over the next two weeks. The 49ers' slate offers no respite, though, with trips to Baltimore and New Orleans on the horizon.</p>

      <h4>Final: 49ers 37, Packers 8</h4>
      <p><b>11:01 p.m.:</b> Rodgers has called it a night. The final five minutes or so will be quarterbacked by Tim Boyle.</p>
      <p><b>10:59 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN, 49ers.</b> San Francisco got a turnover on downs, and took 6:31 off the clock going 69 yards. Raheem Mostert, on the eighth run play of the drive, scores from 15 yards out. <b>49ers 37, Packers 8.</b></p>

      <h4>End third quarter: 49ers 30, Packers 8</h4>
      <p><b>10:32 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN, 49ers.</b> Well, that's a good way to answer a touchdown. Garoppolo hits an extremely open George Kittle over the middle for a 61-yard score. <b>49ers 30, Packers 8.</b></p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p><b>10:26 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN, Packers.</b> Green Bay gets on the board, but it takes more than 8 minutes. A couple of 49ers penalties late extended the drive, and Davonte Adams eventually scores from a couple of yards out. He catches the 2-point conversion, too. <b>49ers 23, Packers 8.</b></p>

      <p><b>10:08 p.m.:</b> San Francisco starts the second half with the ball.</p>
      <h4>Halftime: 49ers 23, Packers 0</h4>
      <p><b>9:53 p.m.: FIELD GOAL, 49ers.</b> A 48-yard field goal from Chase McLaughlin sends us to halftime. An utterly dominant performance from San Francisco. <b>49ers 23, Packers 0.</b></p>
      <p><b>9:52 p.m.:</b> San Francisco sacks Rodgers for the third time, and now the 49ers have enough time to try to add onto the lead.</p>
      <p><b>9:45 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN, 49ers.</b> The Packers punt it away at the 2-minute warning, and Deebo Samuel makes them pay with a 42-yard catch-and-run three plays later. San Francisco blows it wide open, but Green Bay has about a minute left to try to answer. <b>49ers 20, Packers 0.</b></p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p><b>9:38 p.m.: FIELD GOAL, 49ers.</b> San Francisco stalls again in the red zone but widens the lead. At this point, 13 points seems like a tough ask for the Packers. <b>49ers 13, Packers 0.</b></p>
      <p><b>9:34 p.m.:</b> Bulaga won't return, which is very bad news as Green Bay tries to deal with San Francisco's vaunted pass rush.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>9:31 p.m.:</b> Unsurprisingly, the Packers can't take advantage of the second chance granted by the penalty. Though had Matt LaFleur challenged a long incompletion to Jimmy Graham, it may have been overturned to a catch.</p>
      <p><b>9:24 p.m.:</b> San Francisco's defense is absolutely smothering the Packers, but a personal foul penalty on a third-and-35(!) stop will extend Green Bay's drive.</p>
      <h4>End first quarter: 49ers 10, Packers 0</h4>
      <p><b>8:56 p.m.:</b> Would be a significant loss for the Packers offensive line.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>8:54 p.m.: FIELD GOAL, 49ers.</b> Green Bay is losing the field position battle early, and it's hurting. San Francisco takes over at its own 49 and gets to the 11 before settling for a field goal. <b>49ers 10, Packers 0.</b></p>
      <p><b>8:41 p.m.:</b> The teams trade punts.</p>
      <p><b>8:31 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN, 49ers.</b> Wasting no time, Tevin Coleman scores from 2 yards out and takes advantage of the (very) short field. <b>49ers 7, Packers 0.</b></p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1198775705284182016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>

      </figure>
      <p><b>8:28 p.m.:</b> STRIP SACK, 49ers. San Francisco brings an extra rusher on third-and-10, and Fred Warner gets to Aaron Rodgers. The ball comes out, and Joey Bosa falls on it at the 2-yard line. The 49ers are on the doorstep early.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1198775400068837377?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>8:23 p.m.:</b> The Packers open with the ball on the 25 following a touchdback.</p>
      <p><b>8:08 p.m.:</b> Your inactives. Notable, though not super surprising, that 49ers TE George Kittle is not among them.</p>
