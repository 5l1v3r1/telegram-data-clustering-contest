      <p>The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has been stopped from prosecuting a former Comptroller General of Customs (CGC), Abudullahi Inde Dikko for alleged financial infraction while in office by a Federal High Court in Abuja.</p>
      <p>In a judgment on Monday, Justice Nnamdi Dimgba, upheld Dikko’s argument that he can no longer be prosecuted by any agency of the Federal Government after an agreement he entered with the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and the Director-General of the Department of State Services (DSS) to refund $8million to the government.</p>
      <p>According to Justice Dimgba, since it was proved that such an agreement exist, and Dikko has kept his side of the bargain by paying 1,576,000,000 and more to the Federal Government, through the EFCC funds recovery account in Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), it was wrong for the EFCC or any other agency of government to seek to prosecute him (Dikko) on the same alleged crime.</p>
