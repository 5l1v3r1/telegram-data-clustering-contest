      <h1>UK weather forecast: Met Office extends rain warning as 2 inches set to fall in day</h1>
      <h2>The remnants of Tropical Storm Sebastien are set to slam into the UK and the Met Office severe weather warnings say torrential rain could put more homes at risk of flooding</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:00:55+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> has extended its severe weather warnings as the UK braces for torrential rain and fresh fears of flooding from the remnants of Tropical Storm Sebastien.</p>
      <p>Up to 2in of rain could fall in some places in less than 24 hours and there are fears that the system will bring 50mph winds and huge waves.</p>
      <p>Two yellow warnings for rain have been issued - one which covers South West England and South Wales, and the other which affects North East England and Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>Many places in those regions have already been hit by disastrous flooding this autumn.</p>
      <p>As heavy rain batters the country for 48 hours, people living in the warning areas should be prepared for the possibility of severe flooding of homes and roads, travel disruption and power cuts.</p>

      <p>Severe <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> will first strike South West England and South Wales as a large area of heavy rain moves north-eastwards across the UK.</p>
      <p>The warning for those areas will be in place for 33 hours - between 6am on Tuesday and 3pm on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Met Office said 10-20mm of rain will fall "quite widely" while up to 40mm is possible over high ground and in spots where showers are particularly frequent.</p>
      <p>It said: "A broad area of heavy rain is expected to move north-eastwards across this region during Tuesday.</p>

      <p>"Heavy showers then follow, these probably heaviest and most numerous on and near coastal areas, especially in Wales and South West England.</p>
      <p>"Conditions also quite windy at times, especially in coastal areas where gales are likely.</p>
      <p>"Given already saturated ground following recent rainfall this brings the chance of further flooding and travel disruption."</p>
      <p>The yellow rain warning for the North East and Yorkshire will be in place for 24 hours from 6am on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Met Office said many places will see 20-33mm of rain, but 50mm is possible over higher parts of the Pennines and North Yorkshire Moors.</p>
      <p>It added: "Rain is expected to become more persistent during Wednesday and turn heavy at times.</p>
      <p>"The location of the heaviest and most persistent rainfall is still somewhat uncertain and the warning may be updated in the coming days."</p>
      <p>As of Monday morning, the Environment Agency had issued four flood warnings for places where flooding was expected and immediate action was required.</p>
      <p>Those four areas are: Groundwater flooding in Barrow upon Humber; Low Barlings and the Short Ferry Area; low lying properties in the Upper Hull catchment; and Roam Drain and River Hull at Hempholme.</p>
      <p>Almost 50 flood alerts - meaning "be prepared" - were issued across England.</p>
