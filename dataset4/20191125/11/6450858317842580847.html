      <h1>Best Battery Case for Apple iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max</h1>
      <h2>The iPhone 11 family has great battery life already, but you might require extra charge and you definitely need protection.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Jary</a></address>
      <p>Apple is getting better at increasing battery life in its iPhones, with the iPhone 11 Pro’s battery lasting an amazing 4 hours longer than the old iPhone XS.</p>
      <p>The iPhone 11 lasts an hour more than the iPhone XR, which previously held the iPhone battery-life record.</p>
      <p>The iPhone 11 Pro can playback video for 18 hours or blast music out for up to 65 hours - if that’s all you do, of course; most of us use our phones for many tasks, and all eat up power.</p>
      <p>But, at the same time, we dream up new ways of using up that battery life as quickly as we can – streaming movies and TV shows, playing games, taking ultra-wide photos, and so on.</p>
      <p>And sometimes we all forget to charge our phones overnight, and wake up with the dread fear of a fading battery through the day.</p>
      <p>So even if the new Apple iPhones should last longer, they won’t always get you through a busy day of phone use – and certainly not a long-haul flight where you watch your own entertainment channels.</p>
      <p>You can carry a spare battery pack around with you (check out our recommended best power banks), but that can be cumbersome and entail loose cables, etc.</p>
      <p>Or you can buy a battery case for your iPhone 11, 11 Pro or 11 Pro Max, which will give you up to another full charge of juice for when you really need it.</p>
      <p>A battery case also offers you something else every iPhone needs: protection.</p>
      <h3>What to look for in a battery case</h3>
      <p><b>Capacity</b>: In our experience of phone battery cases, 4,800mAh should be fine. Many claim larger power capacities but rarely deliver more than a full recharge (100%) – and that’s all you really need, until you can plug the iPhone in again and power back up.</p>
      <p><b>Protection</b>: The other point of a battery case is to protect your precious iPhone, so look for a decent bumper around the case to save it from drops and a front bevelled edge that will protect the screen from scratches.</p>
      <p><b>Size</b>: There’s no getting away from it – including an extra battery in a case is going to make that skinny, lightweight iPhone into something a bit fatter and heavier. As the iPhone 11 has improved daily power, we think you can keep the battery case for those times when you will need it most: long-haul travel, time away from a power socket, or, most likely, those emergencies when you’ve forgotten to charge the night before. Or you might be something of a power user and drain that 11’s battery faster than most.</p>
      <p>You’ll still need a case for protection, so take a look at what we think are the best cases for iPhone 11.</p>
      <p><b>Fit</b>: The case should also fit the phone snuggly, but not so inflexible that it’s a pain to put on or pull off. The best ones are a one-piece design where you pull back the soft top and slide the phone in, where it connects with the case’s Lightning connector.</p>
      <p>Make sure you buy for the right model as the iPhone 11, 11 Pro and Pro Max are all different sizes. We have marked compatibility on the individual reviews below.</p>
      <p>We have recommended plenty of our favourite iPhone 11 cases, but here is our list of tested battery cases for the iPhone 11 family.</p>
      <h3>Testing methodology</h3>
      <p>We test for real-world battery capacity. Simply, we wait till the iPhone is down to 20% charge, and then activate the battery case.</p>
      <p>When the iPhone is up to 100%, we turn off the battery case, and leave some in there until you need to use it again. Then we add the two charge percentages together to see how much charge you’ll get from each case.</p>
      <p>The Apple case works in a different way, so we just slipped a run-down iPhone into the case to see how much extra it was charged to afterwards.</p>
      <p>It’s not super scientific but this is how you’ll use the case in real life.</p>
      <h3>What’s available now?</h3>
      <p>Aside from the expensive Apple Smart Battery Case, you can find an army of Chinese iPhone 11/Pro/Max battery cases online for a fraction of that cost, and we have been testing the best of them.</p>
      <p>On first glance, the two with the best online reviews (which we then tested, below) are virtually identical (even the data printed there is the same), but there are some key differences.</p>
      <p>While we suspect that what’s out there right now is the same battery case just rebadged, some manufacturers have added some useful features.</p>
      <p>Neither is officially blessed by Apple with its MFi (made for iPhone) certification, but they still work.</p>

        <h4>Apple iPhone Smart Battery Case</h4>

        <ul>
          <li><b>RRP: </b>£129</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Compatible with: iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max</b>
        </p>
        <p>Apple didn’t release its Apple Smart Battery Case for iPhone 11 at the time of the phone’s launch – probably because it wanted to shout about the new mobile’s longer battery life. Announcing a battery case for it would have looked like admitting poor battery life.</p>
        <p>Of course, it’s nothing of the sort. People will use up their phone’s battery however long it can keep going. Many of us need a battery case.</p>
        <p>The Apple Smart Battery Case looks just like the other Smart Battery Cases (for iPhone 7, XS and XR) with a hump on the back and a cut-out for the cameras. There are separate versions for the 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max.</p>
        <p>It is also just as expensive, at a mighty £129 / $129.</p>
        <p>What we like about the Apple case - and it’s almost worth the eye-watering price-tag – is that it keep your phone charged automatically, rather than you having to push a button to start charging.</p>
        <p>It will keep the iPhone at 100% for as long as it can. When it’s finally used up all its charge, the case lets go, and you then have as long as the phone gives you from fully loaded.</p>
        <p>Apple claims only 50% extra battery life. We haven’t tested this yet, but will update this review when we have. We suspect it will do better than 50%.</p>
        <p>Another benefit of going with Apple, is that you can see both the phone and the case’s remaining battery charge by swiping right on the phone to its Notification Centre.</p>
        <p>It’s Qi-wireless, so you can use a wireless charger just as you would with the iPhone itself.</p>
        <p>The case features a dedicated button that launches the Camera app (whether the iPhone is locked or not). A press of the button takes a photo, and a longer press captures video.</p>
        <p>If you use this battery case daily - so your phone is always at 100% - the phone’s internal battery will eventually weaken and its runtime will shorten; so it's best to let both batteries run down every now and again.</p>
        <p>It’s available in either Black or White - with a special Pink Sand colour for the 11 Pro and Pro Max. This is a greater choice (at a cost) than other battery cases we’ve found for the iPhone 11.</p>

          <h4>Newdery Battery Case for iPhone 11 Pro</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3778562/newdery-battery-case-for-iphone-11-pro_thumb800.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <ul>
            <li><b>RRP: </b>£30.99</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <b>Compatible with: iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max</b>
          </p>
          <p>The Newdery battery case looks just like the BasicStock case below, but boasts wireless charging – which we find indispensable. The Pro model we tested is also 12g lighter at 130g.</p>
          <p>The prominent wireless-charging symbol on the back is rather unnecessary – although the wireless function itself is very useful, of course.</p>
          <p>You press the case’s back button for three seconds to start charging the phone. LEDs show you how much charge is left in the case.</p>
          <p>Newdery claims that the battery capacity offers 120% claimed recharge potential. The iPhone 11 and 11 Pro Max cases have a 5,000mAh battery, the 11 Pro's battery is 4,800mAh. We tested the 11 Pro battery case.</p>
          <p>In testing we got just over 100% charge, which is probably all you need before you get to your next charging point - just remember to charge the battery case after using it!</p>
          <p>The case is reassuringly hard, and the top silicone is flexible so easy to fit in and out.</p>
          <p>At the time of writing, this case wasn't available in the US.</p>

            <h4>BasicStock Battery Case for iPhone 11 Pro</h4>
            <figure>
              <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3778562/basicstock-battery-case-for-iphone-11_thumb800.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <ul>
              <li><b>RRP: </b>£27.99</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <b>Compatible with: iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max</b>
            </p>
            <p>It’s basic all right, available in Black only, and packs a standard 4,800mAh battery in its back.</p>
            <p>On that back there’s an on/off switch and four LED battery charge indicators to show you how much juice is left in the case.</p>
            <p>As with the almost identical Newdery cases, the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro Max cases have a 5,000mAh battery, while the 11 Pro's battery is 4,800mAh. We tested the 11 Pro battery case.</p>
            <p>The manufacturer claims you’ll get 120% charge, but that’s theoretical. In practice, we got just under 100% out of it.</p>
            <p>Again, this should be enough to get you through the day until the next charge.</p>
            <p>You can charge the iPhone and case at the same time, using a standard Lightning cable (not included, but we’re sure you have a few lying around).</p>
            <p>As with the Newdery case, the BasicStock case is hard-backed with a flexible silicone top. The Lightning connector fits well.</p>
            <p>At 142g the 11 Pro model is a little heavier than the Newdery case (130g).</p>
            <p>Make sure you buy the right case for your model of iPhone 11.</p>
            <p>At the time of writing, this case wasn't available in the US.</p>
