      <h1>Uhuru Forces ODM to Postpone Party's Crucial Event</h1>

        <b>Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party was, on Monday, November 25, forced to postpone its event for coinciding with that of President Uhuru Kenyatta.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The party had scheduled to launch its new headquarters building located in Lavington, Nairobi, but had to push the event to Thursday, November 28.</p>
      <p>The Raila-led party, in a statement, explained that it had to push the launch date further because the initial one coincided with the day Uhuru was set to receive the much-touted Building Bridges Initiative (BBI).</p>
      <p>The event doubled as the inauguration of the party's digital membership registration.</p>

      <p>"Due to the state event on the BBI scheduled for tomorrow at State House Nairobi, our scheduled event to inaugurate the new party headquarters and the launch digital membership registration has been pushed to Thursday 28/11.</p>
      <p>"Invited guests are reminded to carry their cards to the event," read the statement in part.</p>
      <p>The BBI committee chaired by Garissa Senator <b>Yusuf Haji</b> announced on Friday, November 22, that it was <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46692-uhuru-receive-bbi-report-tuesday">ready to hand over various recommendations</a> it had been tasked with formulating after the handshake between former Prime Minister Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta.</p>
      <p>The committee was officially gazetted on May 31, 2018, where it was supposed to table a report after one year of service.</p>
      <p>In anticipation of the document, Uhuru urged Kenyans to carefully read through the proposals in the document before deciding whether or not to support it. </p>
      <p>“It is only an ignorant person who will say there are no issues in this country that require to be addressed. Let us address them as adults, as civilized human beings, let us appreciate that we may have divergent views but our objective is to make our motherland better," warned Kenyatta.</p>
      <p>After receiving the document on Tuesday, the head of state is expected to present it to the public on Wednesday, November 27, in an event that will be attended by 4,700 delegates at the Bomas of Kenya.</p>
