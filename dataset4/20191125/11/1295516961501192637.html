      <p>Marvel Studios Director of Visual Development Andy Park shared concept art of Natasha Romanoff from <a href="https://screenrant.com/avengers-endgame-deleted-scene-black-widow-death-bad/"><i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a> and in doing so, also revealed she'll get two new costumes in the upcoming <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/black-widow-movie/">Black Widow</a></i> solo film.</p>
      <p>Park has designed all seven incarnations of Black Widow's costume since 2012's <i>The Avengers</i>. In his Instagram post, he said, "I can’t wait for you all to see her 8th &amp; 9th look in her solo film soon!"</p>

      <p>Photos from <a href="https://www.cbr.com/black-widow-white-costume-revealed/">the D23 Expo</a> in August revealed a new white costume, but Park didn't reveal if this is among the two new designs he created for the film, which will launch a whole <a href="https://www.cbr.com/black-widow-movie-new-mcu-franchise/">new franchise in the MCU</a>. The white suit evokes memories of Black Widow's costume from the comics, complete with all the belts, straps and accessories you'd expect a Black Widow costume to have.</p>
