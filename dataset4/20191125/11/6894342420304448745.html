      <p>The most recent tablet we’ve seen from Chinese tech giant Huawei was back in September this year with the MediaPad M5 Lite. While the recent tablet offerings from the company were leaning towards the mid-range level, this time around the company has officially unveiled their latest tablet, the Huawei MatePad Pro – a high-end tablet that could rival Apple’s iPad Pro and Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S6 in terms of hardware.</p>

The Huawei MatePad Pro sports a 10.8-inch display with a 16:9 aspect ratio, 2560×1600 QHD resolution, and features a punch-hole on its top right corner. Its display offers thin 4.9mm bezels with a screen to body ratio of 90%, the largest screen estate offered by a tablet by far. The tablet scales at 460 grams and measures 159 x 245 x 7.2mm.</p>
      <p>Under the hood, the MatePad is equipped the powerful Huawei Kirin 990 SoC, while supporting up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB storage.

      <p>The MediaPad Pro also includes the M-Pencil, a stylus that could magnetically attach itself on the tablet, as well as wireless charge from it. According to Huawei, the stylus is able to work for 10 minutes after a 30-second charge.</p>
      <p>For the camera setup, the tablet’s rear camera features a 13MP sensor with f/1.8 aperture, while its front punch-hole selfie camera is an 8MP sensor. Software-wise, the Huawei MatePad Pro comes with Android 10 with EMUI 10 out of the box, but lacks Google Mobile Service.</p>
