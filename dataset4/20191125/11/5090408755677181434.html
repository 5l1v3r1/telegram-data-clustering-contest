          <b>Shares in Tiffany &amp; Co and LVMH jumped on Monday after the pair agreed a $16.2 billion merger, the largest luxury deal in history.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The US jewelry retailer accepted an offer of $135 in cash per share from the French luxury-goods giant, after rejecting a lower offer earlier this month, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tiffany-m-a-lvmh/tiffany-asks-lvmh-to-raise-its-145-billion-offer-sources-idUSKBN1XG2O3">Reuters reported</a>.</b>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Shares in <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tif-stock">Tiffany &amp; Co</a> jumped 6% in pre-market trading in New York, and <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/lvmhy-stock">LVMH</a> stock climbed 2% in Paris, after the pair <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lvmh-finalizes-deal-to-buy-tiffany-for-162-billion-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">agreed a $16.2 billion merger</a>, the largest luxury deal in history.</p>
      <p>LVMH’s offer of $135 in cash per share represents a 7.5% premium to Tiffany’s closing price on Friday.</p>
      <p>The French luxury-goods giant raised its offer after the US jewelry retailer rejected a bid of $120 earlier this month, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tiffany-m-a-lvmh/tiffany-asks-lvmh-to-raise-its-145-billion-offer-sources-idUSKBN1XG2O3">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
      <p>LVMH owns more than 75 brands including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, and Moët &amp; Chandon. It expects the addition of Tiffany to bolster its US presence and strengthen its jewelry division, which houses Tag Heuer, Bulgari, and other big names.</p>
      <p>While LVMH is the world leader in luxury brands, it hasn’t been as prominent in the jewelry market. Acquiring Tiffany more than doubles the scale of its jewelry business, especially within the US and Asian markets, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-25/louis-vuitton-owner-to-buy-tiffany-for-16-billion-in-u-s-push?srnd=premium">Bloomberg</a>.</p>
