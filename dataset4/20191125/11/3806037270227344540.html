      <h1>Colin Kaepernick Has Had No NFL Offers Since Workout</h1>
      <h2>Kap is still looking for a roster spot.</h2>

      <p>Following his <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/colin-kaepernick-private-nfl-workout-football">private workout</a>, which was held on November 16 down in Georgia, Atlanta, it’s been reported that no teams from the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nfl">NFL</a> have made an offer to former San Francisco 49ers quarterback and social activist <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/colin-kaepernick">Colin Kaepernick</a>.</p>
      <p>As of now, Kaepernick is still looking for a roster spot. According to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28149508/sources-nfl-teams-called-colin-kaepernick-qb-nov-16-workout"><i>ESPN</i></a>, Kaepernick’s team sent out footage of his workout to the 25 franchises that weren’t present for his session at Charles R. Drew High School in Riverdale, Georgia. The teams haven’t called to invite him in for either a visit or a private workout, nor extended any offers.</p>
      <p>During the event, only seven of the confirmed 11 teams came out to take a look at the free agent in action. The workout was initially set to take place at 3 p.m. ET at the Falcon’s training facility. However Kap and his team decided to change the time and locale to Charles Drew High School in Riverdale, Georgia — which is more than 50 miles away from the Falcon’s training facility in Flowery Branch — at the last minute after the league denied them several requests. As things currently stand, the quarterback is considering the possibility of holding a second workout, but this time, he would do it so all 32 teams would easily be able to attend.</p>
      <p>Following his 40-minute workout in Atlanta, Kaepernick said he wanted NFL owners to stop running from him, and holding a private workout just minutes away from them is one way to make that happen. “So we’re waiting for the 32 owners, the 32 teams, Roger Goodell, all of them to stop running, stop running from the truth, stop running from the people,” Kaepernick said on November 16. “Around here, we’re ready to play, we’re ready to go anywhere, my agent Jeff Nalley is ready to talk to any team. I’ll interview with any team at any time.” He continued, “I’ve been ready for three years. I’ve been denied for three years. We all know why I came out here. [I] showed it today in front of everybody. We have nothing to hide.” Keep it locked here for more details when they surface.</p>
