      <p>COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark’s biggest lender Danske Bank said on Monday it would improve governance of its IT systems following an inspection of the systems by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA).</p>
      <p>“We are taking the FSA’s report into consideration and will undertake the necessary measures to ensure compliance with its orders,” Danske Bank said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The FSA said in an inspection report published on Monday it had found “significant weaknesses in its governance of IT security and risks.”</p>
      <p>The FSA also ordered Danske Bank to increase its so-called pillar II capital requirements by a minimum of 2 billion Danish crowns ($295 million) which it said Danske had already done in the third quarter of this year.</p>
