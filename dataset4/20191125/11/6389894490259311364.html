      <p>Wagamama owner The Restaurant Group suffered a share price drop this morning after the Asian fusion chain reported slowing sales growth in the second quarter. </p>
      <p>Like-for-like sales growth was 6.3 per cent in the UK, less than half the 12.9 per cent growth reported in the first quarter of the year. </p>

      <p>Sales growth in the US remained strong at 12.5 per cent in the 22 weeks to 29 September. </p>
      <p>Shares in The Restaurant Group, which also owns Frankie &amp; Benny’s and Chiquito, fell as much as eight per cent to 134.3p before lifting slightly to 136.9p.</p>
      <p>However, in a note to investors JP Morgan analysts said: “Like-for-likes remain impressive against a difficult market backdrop.”</p>
      <p>Turnover increased 11 per cent to £93.5m as the company opened six new Wagamama restaurants and one delivery kitchen during the quarter. </p>
      <p>The casual dining chain, which The Restaurant Group bought for £559m last year, also warned that it will continue to face headwinds in 2020. </p>
      <p>Chief executive Emma Woods said: “Great businesses are built from dedicated people, a commitment to always be on the side of their customers and a galvanising sense of purpose. </p>
      <p>“Wagamama has always followed this model, and I am thrilled to say has delivered another quarter of strong outperformance versus the market with a number of record restaurant sales weeks. </p>
      <p>“We look forward to 2020, and whilst we don’t expect to be immune to the various headwinds facing our industry, we will stay true to our positive culture and growth mindset.”</p>
