      <h1>Shah Rukh Khan’s latest airport look is all things cool and classy</h1>

      <p>Shah Rukh Khan was last seen in Aanand L Rai’s Zero.  After that, the actor took a long break from the movies. Now, it looks like the superstar is gearing back into action. Reports suggest that the actor will play a special part in Brahmastra and earlier today was snapped at the airport soon after Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt were clicked leaving for Chandigarh. </p>
      <p>Now is this a mere coincidence or has the megastar left to shoot for Brahmastra is something only time will tell, but we can’t wait to watch him on the big screen again. King Khan looked fabulous as he stepped out of his swanky ride and headed into the airport wearing a pair of jeans, a spotless white T-shirt and a cool checkered hoodie. Check out the pictures below. </p>
