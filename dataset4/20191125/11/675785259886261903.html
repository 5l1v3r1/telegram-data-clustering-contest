      <p>More than 70 students have suffocated due to a gas leak near their school.</p>
      <p>The incident took place in Hussein Mersal Technical Secondary School in the Egyptian city of Aswan.</p>
      <p>The leak came from a nearby factory, <a href="https://twitter.com/almidankw/status/1198916239097241600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.dataminr.com%2Fapp%2Fdashboard.html">Al-midan News</a> reports.</p>
      <p>It is not clear how old the students are and what their condition is.</p>
      <p>The Aswan Ambulance Facility, headed by Dr.  Mohamed Al-Dakhbili, received a notification of the accident involving more than 70 students and teacher due to the fumes resulting from nearby Kima factory.</p>
      <p>Ambulances attended the scene to take the affected people to hospital for treatment.</p>
      <p>Authorities are continuing their efforts to eliminate the source of the emission.</p>
      <p>Most people with asphyxia were discharged from hospital after recovery and treatment, according to <a href="https://shamra.sy/news/article/b339faa114876fc5ef05d78f664c45ae">Shamra</a>.</p>
      <p>The governor of Aswan, Major General Ahmed Ibrahim, went to the old Kima Factory and ordered the chairman to stop operations emitting harmful fumes.</p>
      <p>He also contacted the Minister of Environment, Dr. Yasmine Fouad, to take the necessary measures with the factory management.</p>
      <p>At least seven people were killed and 16 injured following a gas leak in a Nile Delta village on November 13.</p>
      <p>A local resident said the smell of gas was everywhere and a hospital in the area was packed.</p>
