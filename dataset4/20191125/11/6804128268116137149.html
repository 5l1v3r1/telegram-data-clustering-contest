      <h1>Spurs receive triple injury boost ahead of Jose Mourinho's first home game against Olympiacos</h1>
      <h2>Spurs face Olympiacos on Tuesday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:25:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:25</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham could welcome back Jan Vertonghen and Tanguy Ndombele into their squad for the visit of Olympiacos.</p>
      <p>The pair both missed Saturday's 3-2 win over West Ham in Jose Mourinho's first game in charge, but were back in full training on Monday ahead of the Champions League group game.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/jan-vertonghen">Vertonghen</a> 's hamstring injury has kept him out for the past four weeks but his return to fitness will come as a huge boost to Mourinho ahead of a busy period of games.</p>
      <p>Summer signing Ndombele limped off injured with a groin issue at half-time against Sheffield United in the team's last game before the international break, and was also absent for the London derby.</p>
      <p>Harry Kane was spotted at Hotspur Way, despite initial concerns over a heavy knock sustained during the win over the Hammers, and should be fit to start.</p>
      <p>Mourinho could without Ben Davies, however, with the Welshman not in training despite starting against West Ham.</p>

      <p>Erik Lamela also missed the session, as did teenage striker Troy Parrott who is expected to feature for Tottenham's under-19 side in the Uefa Youth League.</p>
      <p>Speaking after his first win since replacing Mauricio Pochettino, Mourinho admitted it was a relief to be back in the dugout.</p>
      <p>"It was very very important. 11 months without music in the away dressing room, without a smile or happiness," he said.</p>
      <p>"They did it. I am very happy for them and with them. If someone only saw the result they'd have thought it was very difficult for us.</p>
      <p>"But it was probably closer to a 4-0 than 3-1. I think my players paid the price of a very difficult week. International break, change of manager, new guy, different training sessions.</p>
      <p>"The most difficult moments in the 11 months were when I didn't have a pre-season and was looking at other clubs and managers doing it.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes I was at football games and I was thinking what am I doing here, in the box or the studio. Today I was were I belong, my natural habitat."</p>
