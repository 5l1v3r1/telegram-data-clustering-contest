      <h2>2021 Tesla Cybertruck looks..very different</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:48:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/anton-andres.html" target="_blank">Anton Andres</a></address>
      <p>Pickup trucks are fairly conventional things from a styling point of view. They're typically upright with a lot of edges. You could say then that pick-ups, like vans, are the very definition of function over form. Words such as swoopy or radical aren't exactly the first words that roll off the tongue when describing the looks of these, well, workhorses.</p>
      <p>But then there's Tesla. They just entered the pick-up game, and it doesn't exactly look like a pick-up at all.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>They call it the Cybertruck and it looks like it came from a sci-fi flick. This, according to Tesla, is their vision of a pick-up truck. It certainly looks radical with its sharp angles, and the roof line is definitely something we haven't seen on a pick-up.</p>
      <p>You certainly won't mistake it for anything out on the road today. Elon Musk even said that they took inspiration from the first-generation Lotus Esprit. Do a quick image search on it and you might understand what's he's actually on about.</p>
      <p>But the internet had other ideas as to what it looks like. Let's just say the memes were launched the moment the pick-up was unveiled. From what we've been seeing so far, commenters have been saying that it looks like a car from a Playstation game...and we're talking about the original one.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>And the memes just kept coming. The makers of Halo asked Elon Musk if they can even add it to the game, and others have said that it wouldn't look out of place in Minecraft. Some have even likened it to Lara Croft's...er...bust. PS1 Lara Croft, that is.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Other comments? Well, reactions included “it looks like a car a four-year old would design”, to others saying that the car hasn't been fully rendered yet. Perhaps we should've waited for the pickup to load first?</p>
      <figure>

      <p>Of course, it didn't help that the supposedly bullet-resistant windows cracked when they threw a metal ball at it. At least they did redeem themselves somewhat when the truck was unscathed when the smacked a baseball bat on its stainless steel body. Musk claims that the Cybertruck can withstand bullets from a 9mm handgun.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>So what does Musk have to say about all the memes? Turns out, he's not really bothered by them, and gladly reports that there are now about 200,000 orders for the Cybertruck. We may have been poking fun at the Tesla pick-up, but it seems like Musk will be laughing all the way to the bank.</p>
      <p>Memes aside, the Cybertruck does have impressive performance, at least according to manufacturer claims. It's good for a 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) time of 6.5 seconds, which is rapid for a pick-up. Not only that, they claim that it can do over 400 kilometers on a single full charge. Opt for the triple-motor package and that 0 to 60 mph time drops to a mere 2.9 seconds and can go up to 800 kilometers on one full charge. That version can also tow up to 6,350 kilograms, practically twice as much as your standard diesel-fed mid-sized pick-up.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Other noteworthy features? It has adaptive air suspension, has a whopping 406 mm worth of ground clearance, and you can even order it with a tent, a bed (the sleeping on kind, not the one used for loading), and even a stove (presumably electric too).</p>
      <p>The Cybertruck will start rolling out of production lines by 2021 but the automaker is taking in orders as early as now. Will it look exactly like the one shown in Los Angeles? We don't know yet but if it will, it could most certainly be the literal definition of a meme on wheels.</p>
