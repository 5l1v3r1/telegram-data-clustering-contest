      <h1>Unai Emery facing the sack proves Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is getting a free pass at Man Utd</h1>
      <h2>Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United have pretty much had identical seasons, but while Mauricio Pochettino was sacked and Unai Emery is clinging on, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer appears safe</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:25:22+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:25</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal are having a poor season.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are as close to the relegation zone as they are the Champions League places and Unai Emery is under intense pressure to turn things around.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> are also having a poor season.</p>
      <p>Spurs had only picked up 14 points from their opening 12 matches prior to Mauricio Pochettino being sacked, just months after leading the north London club to a first Champions League final.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> and Tottenham aren't the only Big Six team stuttering this campaign.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> are floundering down in ninth - sandwiched between Arsenal and Tottenham - having picked up 17 points from their opening 13 matches.</p>
      <p>They're just seven points above the relegation zone and a staggering 20 points behind league leaders <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool.</a></p>

      <p>To put this into further perspective, if you combined Manchester United and Arsenal's points totals they would still be two behind <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> this season.</p>
      <p>But while Pochettino is out of work and Emery is walking a tight-rope at Arsenal, Solskjaer isn't in the same danger as his rivals.</p>
      <p>So why is this the case?</p>
      <p>Solskjaer was a fan favourite during his time at Manchester United and is, understandably, remembered fondly at Old Trafford on account of his 1999 heroics.</p>
      <p>Supporters also appreciate that the Norwegian has walked in on a work-in-progress and like any manager needs time to get things right.</p>
      <p>But just like Arsenal, United lack any real direction on the pitch, and it isn't clear when things will start clicking.</p>
      <p>It's not comparable to Liverpool of a few seasons ago where they only looked a couple of players short in certain positions - notably in goal and at centre-back.</p>

      <p>Manchester United look short in a number of areas, and Ed Woodward and co. are facing overseeing yet another expensive squad overhaul since Sir Alex Ferguson stood down in 2013.</p>
      <p>Alarmingly, Solskjaer doesn't appear to feel the pressure he's under in the same way as Emery, whose Arsenal side are a point better off as thing stand.</p>
      <p>After Sunday's draw with Sheffield United, the United boss praised England's biggest club for not going four goals behind to the newly-promoted club.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes football is beyond tactics. The energy compared to ours in the first half and then we get that goal and we start to belief," said the Norwegian.</p>
      <p>"The difference in the team this year compared to last is huge. They never give in. Last year we would have gone four or five down instead of coming back. We would not have been able to come back.</p>
      <p>"When you are 2-0 down you have to go for it, play with less fear and just go for it. The average ages of the goals is less than 20, it's something we are proud of. It's a great experience for our young players because it's not easy to comeback at a place like this."</p>
      <p>Emery on the other hand, following Saturday's draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton,</a> admitted Arsenal are struggling, and made it clear he knows he'll be sacked if he doesn't fix things soon.</p>

      <p>"The club are supporting me every day and also I have a responsibility," said Emery.</p>
      <p>"I know I can do better, I can take more performances with the players and I'm going to try to do that. Now my job is to analyse, to try to move on with confidence with the players.</p>
      <p>"It's difficult but we need to move on in the next days. After analysing that match we are going to play at home again on Thursday, prepare as well as possible.</p>
      <p>"We know, and I know, that we need to connect with our supporters."</p>
      <p>Pochettino was linked with the Manchester United manager's job prior to Solskjaer being named boss, and this speculation should have been ramped up when he left Spurs.</p>
      <p>But it hasn't. Solskjaer seems as safe as he always has, with the Manchester United board seemingly going off the idea of hiring the Argentine.</p>
      <p>There's no suggesting Pochettino would do a better job at United, given the apparent turmoil at the Old Trafford club, but the Red Devils have not improved since Jose Mourinho was sacked.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>And interestingly, fans aren't responding to the mediocrity with the same anger as Arsenal. They're not on the Norwegian's back in the way they were with David Moyes.</p>
      <p>But when you consider that Solskjaer recently reached 34 games in management at Old Trafford, winning 57 points - the exact same amount as Moyes after 34 matches - it becomes clear that exceptions are being made for the Norwegian.</p>
      <p>Prior to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> shooting up the league under Frank Lampard, former United boss Mourinho spoke out about the Blues fans clapping the efforts of the club legend's team following a defeat by Liverpool.</p>
      <p>He said on Sky Sports: "I hope they don't get used to it, that's a very important thing.</p>
      <p>"When you start accepting defeats just because your team played well or the players gave their best and gave a performance for people to be proud of in terms of attitude and commitment - I think when you get used to it is when big clubs stop being big clubs."</p>

      <p>While Manchester United fans are no doubt unhappy with what they're seeing from their team and their standing in the league, there certainly does appear to be a sentimentality protecting Solskjaer from serious repercussions.</p>
      <p>And unless this is addressed soon - and fans continue to accept Solskjaer's mediocrity - it's going to be even harder to return to the top.</p>
