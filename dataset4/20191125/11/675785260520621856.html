      <h2>The troubled bank plans to shut 82 branches in 2020 as it moves its focus to digital banking. "We know customers want something different and better from their bank"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:19:49+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:19</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>Just a few days after its latest system breakdown saw people paid hours late, TSB has said it will shut 82 branches next year.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Debbie Crosbie said: "Our new strategy positions TSB to succeed in a challenging external environment at a time when we know customers want something different and better from their bank.</p>
      <p>“With a trusted brand, modern platform, and national presence, TSB is well placed to deliver – but we need to make changes to enable us to compete."</p>
      <p>TSB said it will invest £120million in digital solutions, products and services over the next three years, but close 82 branches.</p>
      <p>“The plan we’re sharing today involves some difficult decisions, but it sets TSB up to succeed in the future," Crisbie said.</p>
      <p>"Taken together, these changes will help us to serve more customers, better, for the long-term.”</p>
