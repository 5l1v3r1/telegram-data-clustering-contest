      <h3>Phisgoc apologizes; venues ready; cauldron lighted for Subic Cluster.</h3>
      <p>A day after the men’s football coaches breathed fire over poor accommodations, transportation and foods, their female counterparts gathered at the head table and shared their sad experiences yesterday ahead of the elaborate opening of the 30th Southeast Asian Games.</p>
      <p>Talking to the media hours before official football action kicked off in two separate venues yesterday, coaches from the six competing nations including the Philippines voiced out their complaints with the opening of the sporting showpiece  just around the corner.</p>
      <p>Even a member of the Philippine squad in Hali Long revealed on Facebook that their hotel was not ready to accommodate the players and officials, even posting  photos showing members cramped in a hotel room function room.</p>
      <p>“Sad that we’re the host team and this is how we’re being treated. I can’t imagine how other countries must feel,” said Long.</p>
      <p>In other developments:</p>
      <p>—House Speaker and Philipine Southeast Asian Games Organizing Committee (Phisgoc) chair Alan Peter Cayetano has appealed for understanding and promised continuous improvements in the country’s hosting.</p>
      <p>—Phisgoc yesterday formally opened the SEAG competitions for Subic Cluster with the lighting of the cauldron.</p>
      <p>—The Philippine Sports Commission announced that facilities owned and operated by the government agency have been refurbished completely and are ready for use by athletes a few days before the meet begins.</p>
      <p>—The Samahang Basketball ng Pilipinas announced that the quartet of CJ Perez, Chris Newsome, Mo Tautuaa and Jason Perkins will comprise the Gilas Pilipinas 3x3 squad with former PBA star Ronnie Magsanoc as coach.</p>
      <p>—Like the athletes and officials, members of the international media covering the 10-nation, 12-day sportsfest also found out that getting accredited was no cakewalk.</p>
      <p>—Gilas Pilipinas coach Tim Cone said that Ginebra center Greg Slaughter could still make it to the National team, assuming he heals from his thumb injury in time for their opening game against Singapore on Dec. 4.</p>
      <p>‘WALANG NUTRIENTS’</p>
      <p>In a press conference, national women’s football mentor Let Dimzon joined coaches from Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and Myanmar in calling the attention of those in charge, saying the food and water they received are poor in quality.</p>
      <p>“I’m not sure kung paano ang arrangement ng Phisgoc, buti the quality and quantity of food is not enough,” said Dimzon. “Sa variety din, like this morning, hindi enough ‘yung rice and kikiam and egg. Walang nutrients”.</p>
      <p>“Supposedly, this is an international competitions, it should be international course. Pero I think  baka ‘yung budget na binibigay ng Phisgoc is not enough to cover ‘yung ganoong klase ng food,” she added.</p>
      <p>An ABS CBN online report quoted Dimzon as saying that “the experience was embarrassing, as they were not treated like this when they traveled abroad for their own tournaments.”</p>
      <p>Dimzon  was not the only one complaining.</p>
      <p>“Today, my breakfast, most of the players eat only break and some egg. We have a big tournament, I hope they will improve the food,” he said.</p>
      <p>Oh yes, the traffic. It didn’t escape the eyes of Vietnam’s Mai Duc Chung.</p>
      <p>“I hope that we have police escorts and don’t have to wait for the bus to arrive. I request to bring more food and escort. We wait for more than one hour for training,” he lamented.</p>
      <p>Sight of workers filling the gaps at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex ended over the weekend as PSC chair Butch Ramirez announced the completion of the renovation at the Rizal coliseum, the Ninoy Aquino stadium, The Rizal football field, the RMSC lawn  tennis courts and the Philsports facilities in Pasig City.</p>
      <p>“We were on target,” Ramirez said. “We gave the people an assurance that we will finish the competition areas on top and our various teams in the PSC did their jobs well. They delivered.”</p>
      <p>PHISGOC APOLOGIZES</p>
      <p>Over at the Phisgoc offices, Cayetano and his aides were asking for understanding.</p>
      <p>“We sincerely apologize  to what happened. We are apologizing for the inconveniences or if I may call it inefficiencies or mis-coordinations,” Cayetano told the media at the World Trade Center in Pasay City.</p>
      <p>Philippine Olympic Committee president Bambol Tolentino was seen nodding his head in approval.</p>
      <p>Cayetano and Tolentino, accompanied by Phisgoc officials, said they resolved the issues when they visited on Sunday all foreign delegates at the Century Park Hotel and provided them with all their needs.</p>
      <p>As of press time yesterday, Phisgoc has yet to say if it has heard the complaints of the women’s football coaches.</p>
      <p>JOURNALISTS IRKED</p>
      <p>A number of foreign journalists were also seen seething with anger. Count Indonesian journalist Sigid Kurniawan as one of them.</p>
      <p>“It’s terrible, I didn’t know what to do, from yesterday,” Kurniawan told ABS-CBN, adding he has yet to get his media ID after arriving on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“I hope the Phisgoc is professional,” he added.</p>
      <p>According to Cone, Slaughter is still “not feeling 100 percent with that thumb”.</p>
      <p>Cone added, however, that the big man could still make it if Slaughter could show he’s 100 percent ready by the time Gilas plays the Singaporeans to kick off their bid for an 18th victory in men’s basketball.</p>
      <p>“If he can show us he’s 100 percent ready, then we will think about making a change at the managers’ meeting and including him at that point.”</p>
      <p>“But he has to prove he’s healthy and that thumb has full range of motion. Right now, he’s still 60, 70 percent ready,” he added.</p>
      <p>Over at the Subic Bay Freeport, Subic May Metropolitan Authority chairman and administrator Wilma Eisma lighted the cauldron using the SEA Games torch as SBMA employees, workers and Phisgoc members watched in glee.
