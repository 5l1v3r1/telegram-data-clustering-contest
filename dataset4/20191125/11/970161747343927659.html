      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/aladdin/">Aladdin</a> and Charlies Angels actress Naomi Scott owned the red carpet alongside the likes of Olivia Colman and Hayley Atwell at the 65th Evening Standard Theatre Awards.</p>
      <p>Held at The London Coliseum on Sunday evening, the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/disney/">Disney</a> star was every inch Jasmine as she sported a bedazzling burgundy crop and matching skirt.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old, fresh from the promotional trail of her latest flick in which she’s taking the helm as a tough-as-rocks crime fighter alongside Kristen Stewart and Ella Ballinska (who was also at the event), was a ceremonial goddess last night.</p>
      <p>Matching her dress to her makeup, she added a fierce smattering of red eyeshadow to amp up the drama.</p>
      <p>It’s theatre after all, darling.</p>

      <p>Her appearance on the red carpet comes after she recently spoke about her ethnicity and how she found it hard making a break in the industry.</p>

      <p>The star, who is of British and Indian descent, said to Teen Vogue: ‘There’s a thing of someone [being] like… “she’s not white, she’s not Black, she’s not Latina, what is she?”</p>

      <p>‘There were definitely a few leads that I went for where I think, ultimately, I was maybe the other choice, the “exotic” choice, or the “other.”‘</p>
      <p>Still, she shook off the recent controversy <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/charlies-angels-box-office-bomb-taking-just-3-1m-first-two-days-release-11169987/">that is the box office takings of Charlie’s Angels</a> to get her glad rags on alongside husband, footballer Jordan Spence.</p>
      <p>She was joined by Avengers star Hayley Atwell, who worked a sheer, tulle gown for photographers, as well as model Jourdan Dunn, who brought the razzamatazz in a sequinned Green dress.</p>

      <p>Not to be left out of a stylish celebration, Anna Wintour fronted up to the bash alongside daughter Bee Shaffer, who braved the cold in a white, cut-out gown.</p>
      <p>Vogue editor Anna wasn’t about to let the chilly London air give her influenza, as she wore a floor-length coat over her silver gown.</p>

      <p>Fresh from her debut as Queen Elizabeth in The Crown’s second series, Fleabag’s Olivia was on hand in a swish black ensemble.</p>
      <p>Looking poised for the camera, Olivia wore a black, lace gown with white flowers embroidered down the middle and along the décolletage. You could say the outfit was fit for a queen? You could…</p>

      <p>Olivia, who took to the stage to present Lynn Nottage and her production Sweat the award for best play, in partnership with Chanel, looked ecstatic as she posed with winners backstage.</p>
      <p>This sure is one stylish red carpet if we do say so ourselves.</p>
