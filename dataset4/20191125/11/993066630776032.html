      <p>Opera star Andrea Bocelli’s foundation has made a large donation to the Royal College Of Music.</p>
      <p>Around £750,000 will help up-and-coming singers overcome financial barriers to training at the famous music conservatoire, whose alumni includes Andrew Lloyd Webber, Vaughan Williams and Ray Davies.</p>
      <p>The money has been donated from the Italian tenor’s foundation, together with the organisation Community Jameel.</p>
      <p>The classical singer, 61, said: “The Andrea Bocelli Foundation believes that music education can become an integral part of the lives of children and youth.”</p>

      <p>Music is “a powerful tool to promote the discovery and full expression of the self,” he said.</p>
      <p>The London college, established by royal charter in 1882, wants to “widen access to excellent music education”.</p>
      <p>It aims to offer financial support to 75% of students by 2020.</p>
      <p>After Bocelli visited the college, its director Professor Colin Lawson said: “This new scholarship will give young singers each year the remarkable opportunity to study at the RCM without financial burden.”</p>
      <p>Philanthropic partnerships are “vital” in helping “to make musical education available to all”, he said.</p>
      <p>The Andrea Bocelli Foundation-Community Jameel Scholarship will support students every year from 2020/21.</p>
