      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:28:56+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:28</time> by <a rel="author">Stephanie Balloo, https://www.facebook.com/MissBalloo/</a></address>
      <p>This is the moment a vicious brawl erupted inside <i>another</i> city cinema just hours on from a terrifying machete riot at Star City.</p>
      <p>Violent scenes have now emerged from Five Ways Cineworld - and they were filmed a mere five hours after armed youths <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/six-teens-banned-every-uk-17310252">stormed the Vue Cinema in Nechells</a> on Saturday night (November 23).</p>
      <p>The worrying disorder, <b>which was caught on camera and shared to Snapchat and can be viewed above</b> , broke out at the Broad Street cinema around 10.45pm.</p>
      <p>In alarming new footage, enraged youths can be seen hurling punches at one another in the foyer.</p>

      <p>Around eight of the males are filmed fist fighting on the cinema's signature red carpet before two clear groups seem to separate.</p>
      <p>Some pull away from the fight - fists still raised- but begin backing up towards the door onto Broad Street.</p>
      <p>Keeping their eyes on the other group, the men make a backwards run for the exit.Â </p>
      <p>They appear to be chased out of the cinema by the others, with violence then spilling into the street.</p>
      <p>A large crowd of cinema-goers can be seen watching on and staying out of the disorder.</p>
      <p>Police swooped to the scene and broke up the disorder, but no weapons were seen and no one was believed to be injured.</p>
      <p>It came just hours after a major disorder involving machetes as <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/he-dealt-with-police-respond-17308479">Blue Story was screened at Vue Cinema in Star City.</a></p>
      <p>Seven officers were injured as police battled to control the Nechells riots from around 5.30pm.</p>
      <p>The violence sparked fears over the gang film, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/exclusive-vue-bans-blue-story-17307755">which has since been axed from all Vu</a> e cinemas, as it was believed to have been showing in Cineworld at the time.</p>
      <p>The video caption reads: "This is what man's on after Blue Story?!?!? Mad film."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/blue-story-star-city-rapman-17310122">BBC Films swooped to defend the film,</a> which they were involved in, saying it is centred around "love not violence".</p>
      <p>Writer and director Andrew Onwubolu, known as Rapman, described the incident as "truly unfortunate" and said he hoped it was not an "indictment" of the film.</p>
      <p>West Midlands Police say the latest Cineworld fight was an 'isolated incident' which spilled from the street into the foyer.</p>
      <p>It is not believed be connected to the film, however police said they couldn't rule it out.</p>
      <p>"Police were alerted at 10.45pm on Saturday night (23 Nov) to a disorder at Cineworld cinema, Broad Street, involving a group of about eight youths.</p>
      <p>"They were moved on by staff and quickly dispersed.</p>
      <p>"No weapons were seen and there are no reports of any injuries.</p>
      <p>"It's believed this was an isolated incident and that the disorder started in the street and spilled into the foyer."</p>
