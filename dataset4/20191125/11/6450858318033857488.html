      <h2>Doctor Who is back next year for season 12 - here's everything we know so far, including the latest news and rumours about the cast, plot, and release date</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:44:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:44</time> by <a rel="author">Dominic Preston</a></address>
      <p>Doctor Who returned last year for its long-awaited eleventh season (since its modern reboot, that is), heralding the arrival of a new Doctor, a new showrunner, and an even bigger first: a female star.</p>
      <p>With the season now finished, the next thing to look forward to is season 12 - here's everything we know so far.</p>
      <h3>When is Doctor Who back?</h3>
      <p>With season 11 and the New Year's Special done, everyone's already talking about season 12. Jodie Whittaker is staying on as the Doctor for at least another year, after a phenomenal debut, along with the rest of the fam.</p>
      <p>You'll have to wait until 2020 to watch more of the Doctor though. We don't know when it will air, but the BBC has confirmed the season will start in 'early 2020' so there shouldn't be too much longer to wait.</p>
      <p>You can at least still catch up on older episodes. That's helped by the BBC's decision to add every single episode of the show since 2005 - including all the specials - to the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3678386-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fentertainment%2Fdoctor-who-3678386%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fprogrammes%2Fb006q2x0">iPlayer streaming service</a>, announcing that they'll stay online until at least the season 11 finale. That means you get every episode from every Doctor from Christopher Eccleston to Peter Capaldi, without paying a penny.</p>
      <h3>Is there a season 12 trailer?</h3>
      <p>Yup! It took months, but in November 2019 the Beeb finally dropped our first look at the next season of the show, and it's a doozy:</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>How can you watch Doctor Who in the US?</h3>
      <p>Obviously Doctor Who is a British show, but in recent years BBC America has been better about airing the show as close as it can to the British air date, to minimise piracy. That was the same for season 11 - BBC America aired each episode in a regular Sunday evening slot at 8/7c.</p>
      <p>That means there's a few-hour delay. If that's still too much of a gap, and you want to watch episodes as they air live in the UK, you can <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/internet/best-vpn-for-bbc-iplayer-2018-3673782/">use a VPN</a> to stream episodes on <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/digital-home/watch-bbc-iplayer-abroad-3512135/">iPlayer</a> as if you were in the UK. Bear in mind that this is a breach of the iPlayer terms of use, since you won't be paying the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/digital-home/do-i-need-tv-licence-how-save-money-on-your-tv-licence-catchup-iplayer-2016-3423808/">licence fee</a>, but it will let you watch new episodes the moment us Brits get to.</p>
      <p>That's also what you'll have to do if you want to take advantage of the BBC's to decision to add every episode of the show's modern era so far to iPlayer - so <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/internet/best-vpn-for-bbc-iplayer-2018-3673782/">grab a VPN</a> if you know you've missed a few and want to catch up.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, you can stream every episode of the modern show so far on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rose/dp/B003LQ3YXU?ascsubtag=06-3678386-11-0000000">Amazon Prime Video</a> - though that will change soon. Warner Bros. has acquired exclusive US streaming rights to the series for <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/entertainment/hbo-max-3699426/">HBO Max</a>, so going forward that's where you'll need to go to watch any and all Doctor Who from 2005 onwards. That will include season 12 and other new episodes, but only after they're broadcast on BBC America first.</p>
      <h3>What to expect from season 12</h3>
      <p>Understandably we don't know a lot about season 12 yet, but we do know that one episode will feature the return of everyone's favourite space rhinos, the Judoon.</p>

      <p>We know that the episode in question will guest star Neil Stuke, and showrunner Chris Chibnall also released a short statement hinting at exactly what to expect from it:</p>
      <p>"No! Sho! Blo! The Judoon are storming back into Doctor Who in full force, and the streets of Gloucester aren’t safe. If anyone has anything to hide, confess now. The Judoon are taking no prisoners, and will stop at nothing to fulfill their mission! The whole team on Doctor Who are delighted and scared in equal measure to welcome them back: One of many treats we’ve got in store for viewers next series."</p>
      <p>It hasn't been announced officially, but <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3678386-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fentertainment%2Fdoctor-who-3678386%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fio9.gizmodo.com%2Fnew-doctor-who-set-pictures-confirm-the-return-of-some-1839208432">set photos reveal</a> that another iconic enemy is back this year: the Daleks. It's not clear if the photo is from season 12 or an upcoming Christmas special, with conflicting reports, but either way they will be exterminating. The Cybermen also pop up in the trailer above, so that's another big bad coming back.</p>
      <p>We also know some of the talent behind the camera, which includes three new writers and four new directors, along with the return of the writers behind some of season 11's best episodes: Demons of the Punjab, It Takes You Away, and Kerblam! Check out the full list on the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3678386-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fentertainment%2Fdoctor-who-3678386%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fblogs%2Fdoctorwho%2Fentries%2Ff4d504e6-b228-4931-8d85-b1f9f30a0d2d">BBC site</a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile both Stephen Fry and Lenny Henry are confirmed to be appearing as guest stars, and in the <i>same episode</i>. They'll both appear in the series premiere, which apparently "might be the biggest episode the show’s done," <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3678386-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fentertainment%2Fdoctor-who-3678386%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.denofgeek.com%2Fuk%2Ftv%2Fdoctor-who%2F68682%2Fdoctor-who-series-12-cast-tease-biggest-episode-the-show-s-done">according to Chibnall</a>.</p>
