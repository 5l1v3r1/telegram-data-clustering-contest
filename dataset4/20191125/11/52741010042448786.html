      <p>A lengthy discussion is set to take place at Kitchener city hall, as council takes a glance at their operating budget for next year.</p>
      <p>Plans won't likely be finalized until a budget meeting set for January 20th, 2020. Â But as it stands, there is a proposed property tax increase of 2.2 per cent for 2020.</p>
      <p>That would work out to being $24 extra for the average homeowner for the year, while increases to water utilities and gas would put the total increase to $81 on average for homeowners.</p>
