      <p>A <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/belfast">Belfast</a> man who was left on life support after being hit by a car seven years ago has spoken of his incredible weight loss journey following the near-death experience.</p>
      <p>Ben Rashbrook was left in a coma for four weeks after suffering serious injuries including bleeding on the brain after he was knocked off his bicycle in Dunmurry back in 2012.</p>
      <p>He had a shattered right arm, broken ribs, collapsed and punctured lungs, a torn liver and lost the use of one of his kidneys, <a href="https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/sport/other-sport/west-belfast-man-left-life-17302968">Belfast Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>At one stage Ben says the doctors told his wife Joanne that they were considering switching off his life support as there was nothing more they could do for him.</p>

      <p>"I ended up in a coma for a month after the incident, and I was in hospital for three months," Ben said.</p>
      <p>"I don't remember anything about getting run over. I ended up in hospital with bleeds on the brain, a shattered right arm, shattered ribs, collapsed and punctured lungs, and a torn liver.</p>
      <p>"I lost the use of both kidneys at the time but they were able to get one working again. I was on dialysis for six weeks but that kidney is now deteriorating and I am in stage three chronic kidney disease.</p>
      <p>"I had been in a coma for two weeks when they told my wife that were going to start turning off the life support machines.</p>
      <p>"She pleaded with them to give me three weeks, because it usually took me that long to shake off a cold.</p>
      <p>"Thankfully, in the third week I started to respond.</p>

      <p>"I came out of the coma, then they induced me into another one and brought me out again, to aid the recovery process.</p>
      <p>"Eventually I got taken off life support."</p>
      <p>Ben signed himself out of hospital after three months and started regular physiotherapy sessions to help get his strength up again.</p>
      <p>He also attended regular reviews at Thompson House for the brain injury he sustained.</p>
      <p>"I still go to Thompson House once a year for a review," Ben added. "It is just part of my long-term rehabilitation."</p>
      <p>Ben's remarkable weight loss journey started three years after his accident.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old's weight ballooned from 11st to 17st from 2012 to 2015, prompting his kidney specialist to issue a health warning.</p>
      <p>"It was November 2015 when my specialist said my weight was putting a lot of pressure on my kidney," Ben said.</p>
      <p>"My specialist said my kidney was struggling and I had to do something about it. So that's when I decided to get in shape."</p>
      <p>And that's when Ben's journey started.</p>
      <p>He teamed up with personal trainer TJ McAteer who he initially trained with five days a week.</p>
      <p>"I trained with TJ five days a week, mainly doing weights and building up my strength. I did some cardio as well," Ben said.</p>
      <p>"I also trained the other two days on my own, chipping away at the weight and getting fitter. I also cleaned up my diet, eating whole foods.</p>
      <p>"I eat things like turkey burgers, beef burgers, mince, rice and vegetables.</p>
      <p>"I got down to 11st with TJ, and now I have built myself up to about 12-and-a-half stone.</p>
      <p>"It's my way of life now."</p>
      <p>Ben admits he is fortunate to be alive, but is determined to live his life to the fullest after almost dying seven years ago.</p>
      <p>He has also recently opened his own supplement store R Supplements Ltd on the Glen Road in West Belfast.</p>
      <p>"It gives me a purpose in life during the day, and then I have my training as well. And my family," the dad-of-three added.</p>
      <p>"I am just so grateful for still being here, so I want to make the best of my life. I am very fortunate to be alive. I don't take my life for granted anymore, that's for sure.</p>
      <p>"After what happened to me, it changes your mindset completely. I feel okay now. I am coping the best I can.</p>
      <p>"I can't complain too much. I am still alive."</p>

      <p>Personal trainer TJ McAteer of TJ Fit, who works in the physiotherapy department at the Ulster Hospital, said: "Ben's journey is remarkable when you consider what he and his family have been through.</p>
      <p>"Losing six stone is an incredible achievement, especially for Ben who has come through so much over the past seven years.</p>
      <p>"He has kept at the training and is a credit to himself and his family."</p>
