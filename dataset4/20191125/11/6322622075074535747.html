      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 25): 7-Eleven Malaysia Holdings Bhd's net profit grew a marginal 1.32% to RM16.98 million in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2019, from RM16.76 million in the same period last year, as it recorded higher revenue and marketing income, which were partially offset by higher staff cost.</p>
      <p>The convenience store operator noted that the higher staff cost was due to higher store counts and the impact of minimum wage, which has weighed on the company's earnings growth.</p>
      <p>Quarterly revenue rose 4.51% to RM594.16 million from RM568.52 million a year ago, according to a filing with Bursa Malaysia today. Earnings per share stayed the same, at 1.48 sen.</p>

      <p>7-Eleven attributed the higher earnings during the period to the increase in revenue, favourable sales mix, higher marketing income and improved logistics expenses recovery.</p>
      <p>On prospects, 7-Eleven said its board of directors expect trading conditions for the next quarter to be stable.</p>
      <p>"We will continue to focus on our customers' needs, pursuing our core strategy pillars of Operational Excellence, Cost Management and Commercial Innovation, at the same time refreshing the 7-Eleven brand in the mind of customers through refreshed stores, innovations in our pricing, promotions, and developing exciting products," said the company.</p>
