        <figcaption>What is Storm Sebastien?</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Flood-ravaged areas in the UK are bracing for more heavy rain over the next five days as Storm Sebastien gets set to hit.</p>
      <p>The storm, which formed in the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/weather">tropical Atlantic</a> last week, is moving northeastwards and looks set to affect the UK by midweek, Sky reports.</p>
      <p>Sky News weather presenter Isobel Lang said: "More rain is forecast this week with the focus across southern and northeastern parts of the UK for the heaviest totals at this stage.</p>
      <p>"The remnants of tropical storm Sebastien will raise concerns too.</p>
      <p>"This storm formed in the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/weather">tropical Atlantic</a> last Tuesday and had since meandered around looking rather uneventful.</p>
      <p>"However, it is now moving northeastwards at more of a pace and its remnants look set to affect us in some way by midweek.</p>
      <p>"The remnants of this tropical storm are likely to bring outbreaks of heavy rain and coastal gales, coinciding with some high spring tides across much of the UK through Tuesday and Wednesday and the Met Office has weather warnings in force in anticipation."</p>
      <p>Five flood warnings have already been put in place by the Met Office across England and Wales along with 60 less severe flood alerts.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/weather">Met Office weather forecaster</a> Alex Burkill said: "Across the next five days we have got warnings for each day.</p>
      <p>"On Wednesday it's covering that area of Yorkshire and Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, that area which saw the severe flooding.</p>
      <p>"At the moment, the rainfall is not expected to be particularly heavy for the time of year, but we are expecting it to be significant. There are likely to be some impacts."</p>

      <p>The North East isn't affected by any warnings but it is expected to see some very wet weather over the coming days.</p>
      <p>Here's what to expect:</p>
      <h3>Monday</h3>
      <p>"A largely dull day with cloud covering high ground.</p>
      <p>"Outbreaks of rain are also expected, largely confined to high ground at first, though spreading to most parts through the afternoon and becoming more persistent for a time. Maximum temperature 9 °C."</p>
      <h3>Monday evening</h3>
      <p>"Cloudy and misty, with outbreaks of rain continuing for most through the night, though perhaps turning lighter and more patchy after midnight.</p>
      <p>"Extensive low cloud continuing to cover high ground. Minimum temperature 6 °C."</p>
      <h3>Tuesday</h3>
      <p>"A dull start with extensive cloud, improving for a time mid morning, before further rain and extensive low cloud moves up from the south through the afternoon, clearing north overnight. Maximum temperature 10 °C."</p>
      <h3>Outlook for Wednesday to Friday</h3>
      <p>"Wet at times and breezy on the coast, Wednesday. Turning drier and fresher through Thursday with brisk northerly winds. Frosty start inland on Friday, then bright with isolated coastal showers."</p>
