      <h1>Ryan Reynolds now owns a stake in budget carrier Mint Mobile</h1>
      <h2>Who knew 'Deadpool' and low-cost wireless would have something in common?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:10:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>No, you're not hallucinating. Actor Ryan Reynolds has <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/25/1951947/0/en/Ryan-Reynolds-Purchases-Ownership-Stake-in-Mint-Mobile.html">bought</a> an ownership stake in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/26/best-mvnos/">Mint Mobile</a>, the low-cost carrier that theoretically saves you money by letting you purchase service in advance. It sounds like a complete mismatch when celebrities have a habit of backing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/25/nasa-calls-out-goop-healing-stickers/">junk science</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014/06/30/bando-to-release-its-own-celebrity-endorsed-headphones-with-dj-kha/">designer headphones</a>, but to Reynolds it makes sense -- it's better to promote a "more practical approach to the most essential technology" than luxury products you don't really need.</p>
      <p>And this isn't strictly a publicity move, either. Reynolds will help with communications and marketing, but he'll also be involved in "strategic decision-making" at Mint. You're not likely to see Deadpool hawking service, unfortunately, but his actor will have a very real say in the future of a wireless carrier.</p>
      <p>To some extent, this reflects the shifting cellular landscape in the US. While the top four carriers (AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Engadget parent Verizon) still tend to dominate, there's been a rush of virtual providers like Mint, Ting and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/17/googles-fi-unlimited-plan/">Google Fi</a> that have experimented with different business models. Reynolds' involvement gives their unconventional forumlas a dash of extra credibility, even if they're not about to topple the establishment.</p>
