      <p><a href="http://concisenews.global/entertainment/">R. Kelly</a>‘s live-in girlfriend/alleged sex slave, Joycelyn Savage has made new claims on abortion, and assault against the embattled American singer, <a href="http://concisenews.global/">Concise News</a> learnt.</p>
      <p>According to the Chicago Sun-Times, which says it has read Joycelyn’s latest Patreon posts since Saturday, R. Kelly allegedly once impregnated her and forced her to have an abortion procedure in his own home, this according to Joycelyn, supposedly.</p>
      <p>Per CST, Joycelyn wrote that by late 2016, she became aware that she was pregnant, saying “I realized I was pregnant by this monster, Eventually, I ended up getting an abortion I was forced to get the surgery done at his house.”</p>
      <p>On another alleged occasion, Joycelyn reportedly writes on Patreon that she called R. Kelly “babe” instead of “Daddy” or “Master,” and as a result she was allegedly attacked by him.</p>
      <p>“He grabbed me and choked me until I blacked out,” she wrote</p>
      <p>Joycelyn reportedly went on to describe being peed on by R. Kelly “numerous times” and also allegedly being used as a “punching bag.”</p>
      <p>She also reportedly describes being constantly monitored by R. Kelly’s handlers, including during media interviews as well around the house, including while she showered.</p>
      <p>Joycelyn reportedly says she was once starved for days to rehearse for an on-camera statement</p>
      <p>She described other women R. Kelly would allegedly bring home that stayed there “just like me, and they were definitely younger than me”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, R. Kelly’s attorney, Steven Greenberg, cast doubt on her allegations and suggested she was only out for money by coming forward.</p>
      <p>Recall that the <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/07/12/why-police-re-arrested-american-singer-r-kelly/">American singer was arrested in July</a><a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/07/12/why-police-re-arrested-american-singer-r-kelly/"> </a>over alleged child pornography and federal sex trafficking.</p>
