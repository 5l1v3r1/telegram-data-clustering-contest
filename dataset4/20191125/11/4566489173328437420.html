      <h1>Rare protest in Kyrgyzstan after report claims massive graft</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:50:11+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:50</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Hundreds of protesters held a rare demonstration in Kyrgyzstan on Monday sparked by a whistleblower's claims of massive official corruption.</p>
      <p>The whistleblower who spoke to journalists was a Chinese Uighur businessman involved in the bribery that he exposed. He fled the country saying he feared for his life, but was murdered in Turkey this month.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators held a march and a rally outside the main government building in Bishkek in response to a dramatic report claiming corrupt officials took huge pay-offs in return for turning a blind eye to smuggling millions of dollars out of the impoverished country.</p>
      <p>The rally with many young people participating appeared to be an expression of grassroots outrage at the large-scale graft, as it was not called by any prominent politician. Local media reported up to 1,000 participants.</p>
      <p>One protester, 57-year-old Kenzhebek, called the revelations the "final straw" for Kyrgyzstan, the second poorest of the former Soviet republics.</p>
      <p>"Today, unfortunately, we see the authorities following the same corrupt path as previous presidents," Kenzhebek told AFP.</p>
      <p>The report authored by the US-based Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's Kyrgyz service and the independent Kyrgyz news website Kloop.kg came out Thursday.</p>
      <p>It cites the whistleblower as saying a powerful China-born tradesman of Uighur descent paid huge bribes to the customs service to enable the smuggling scheme.</p>
      <p>- Whistleblower gunned down -</p>
      <p>The revelations have piled further pressure on the ex-Soviet country's fragile government led by President Sooronbai Jeenbekov, who has declared his aim to "struggle against corruption".</p>
      <p>The report implicated a former customs official, Rayimbek Matraimov, nicknamed "Rayim Million" by his critics, rumoured to have bankrolled numerous political campaigns despite being a poorly paid civil servant.</p>
      <p>Protesters in Bishkek held up placards showing Matraimov's face with the slogan: "Put Rayim in prison." Others waved football-style yellow cards.</p>
      <p>Matraimov is officially the target of a police investigation into illegal enrichment but has not been charged and has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>The key whistleblower behind the explosive claims, Aierken Saimaiti, a former resident of Kyrgystan was gunned down in Istanbul on November 10, before the report came out. Turkish police have detained four suspects.</p>
      <p>He had told journalists he feared for his life and had fled Kyrgyzstan after helping underground traders funnel around $700 million out of the country, having paid kickbacks to officials.</p>
      <p>Opposition-led protests in Kyrgyzstan brought down successive presidents in 2005 and 2010 but few reforms have followed.</p>
      <p>The mountainous country of some 6 million people looks to China for much-needed investment but also hosts a Russian military airbase.</p>
