      <p>Gov. Ben Ayade of Cross River has approved the dissolution of the state anti-deforestation task-force with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>This is contained in a statement by Mr. Christian Ita, Special Adviser to the governor on Media and Publicity and made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Calabar.</p>
      <p>Ayade said that the approval of the interim task-force was to continue the enforcement of the anti-deforestation policy of the government.</p>

      <p>“The new interim task-force has Dr. Odey Oyama as chairman with the 18 Heads of Local Government Administration (HOLGA) as members.</p>
      <p>“It should be noted that any HOLGA that allows illegally logged woods to pass through his or her local government area, faces termination from the local government service,” he said.</p>
      <p>NAN reports that the former interim anti-deforestation task-force, the team which served for over four months, was headed by Mrs. Florence Inyang as Chairman with other members.</p>
