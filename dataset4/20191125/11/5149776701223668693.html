      <p>Restaurant manager David Cheung is very proud of the Christmas fayre at <a href="https://www.cosmo-restaurants.co.uk/restaurants/nottingham">Cosmo</a>, saying: "Around Christmas we put out a selection of roast meats and vegetables with all the trimmings so if you're after a traditional turkey dinner, you can have one.</p>
      <p>"And that's not at the expense of our other dishes either - it's an extra!"</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cosmo-restaurants.co.uk/restaurants/nottingham">Cosmo</a> has 17 restaurants across the country from Edinburgh and Glasgow to Bristol, Dublin and Belfast with a branch soon to open in Paris.</p>

      <p>David added: "We are very popular with groups and with families because we have such a wide choice of dishes. Families like to come to us because it's a chance for children to taste lots of new foods while groups like the fact we can easily accommodate lots of people together."</p>
      <p>Prices for Christmas start at £10.99 for lunch and £17.99 for dinner - where else will you get all that choice for such great value?</p>
      <p>David said: "Come to <a href="https://www.cosmo-restaurants.co.uk/restaurants/nottingham">Cosmo</a> this Christmas for more fun, more festivities and more choice."</p>
