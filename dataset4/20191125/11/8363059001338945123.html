      <h1>eBay Kicks Off Black Friday Week With Up to 51% Off a Bunch of Stuff</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:00:30+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>And that bunch of stuff includes toys, TVs, laptops, and more from brands like Lego, Samsung, and Lenovo.</p>
      <p>Not everything is over half off in eBay's Black Friday sale, but depending on what catches your eye, you can save up to £50 on electric toothbrushes and a Google Home Hub, and over £75 on a new laptop, but I'm sure there'll be more deals on the way, so don't blow your load just yet - some of these discounts aren't all that fantastic.</p>
      <p>That being said, the more generous same items look pretty tempting, like the Lego Harry Potter Knight Bus for just £20, with 39 per cent knocked off the RRP. Take a gander at the deals below to see if anything floats your boat.</p>
