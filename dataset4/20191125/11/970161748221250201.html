      <p>A Spanish luxury <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fashion/">fashion</a> brand has recently come under fire for releasing an outfit that according to critics resembled concentration camp uniforms.</p>
      <p>Loewe, who launched the product as part of its new William De Morgan capsule collection on 14 November, has now decided to pull the look from the range.</p>
      <p>The outfit, which featured vertical stripes in black and white, was likened to threads worn by victims of the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/holocaust/">Holocaust</a> by fashion industry watchdog, Diet Prada, on its Instagram page.</p>
      <p>‘Unable to see anything but concentration camp uniforms in this $1,840 ensemble from @loewe’s William de Morgan capsule, a collection meant to “capture a freedom of imagination”,’ Diet Prada captioned the post.</p>
      <p>‘But with the particular stripe proportions and layout, uniform-style garments, and prominent chest patches, there’s not actually much left to the imagination when the resulting look is so uncannily disturbing.’</p>

      <p>The watchdog also went on to say that Loewe has ‘week-old’ complaints on a post from British Vogue, where the outfit is featured.</p>

      <p>Prior to being removed from the brand’s website, the item was described as ‘Stripe Workwear Jacket White/Black’, according to the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/fashion-brand-loewe-called-out-for-outfit-resembling-concentration-camp-uniform/?utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow">New York Post</a>.</p>
      <p>Loewe has now issued a statement via its Instagram Stories, with a public apology to ‘anyone who might feel we were insensitive’.</p>
      <p>‘It was brought to our attention that one of our looks featured in a magazine and part of our Arts and Crafts ceramicist William De Morgan could be misconstrued as referring to one of the most odious moments in the history of mankind,’ the statement read.</p>
      <p>‘It was absolutely never our intention and we apologise to anyone who might feel we were insensitive to sacred memories.</p>
      <p>‘The products featured have been removed from our commercial offering.’</p>
