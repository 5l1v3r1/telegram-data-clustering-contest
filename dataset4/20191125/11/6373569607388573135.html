      <p>Plymouth Argyle are looking to appoint a full-time under-18s head coach for their academy.</p>
      <p>It comes after <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">the Pilgrims</a> hired Chris Beard as their head of academy recruitment earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Another recent change has seen the departure of academy director Kevin Hodges, the club’s record appearance holder and former manager.</p>
      <p>Applications to be the under-18s head coach must be received by academy manager Phil Stokes by 12 noon on Thursday, December 5.</p>
      <p>A salary of £28,000-£31,000, depending on qualifications and experience, is on offer.</p>
      <p>Argyle’s advertisement reads: “Our proactive football academy is looking to recruit a full-time under-18s head coach.</p>
      <p>“You will work collaboratively with the director of football, first team manager and academy manager and provide updates on the players’ progress.</p>
      <p>“The club are developing a new strategy and playing philosophy that will be disseminated through the club from academy tot he first team.</p>
      <p>“This is an exciting opportunity for a forward-thinking coach to join our category three academy.</p>
      <p>“This is a key role in the development of the academy and the primary focus will be to develop and educate the under-18s players on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>“It is critical that the successful applicant understands the FA/EFL and Premier League rules as well as developing players across the FA’s four corner model – technical, tactical, physical and psychological/social – establishing an individual learning plan for each player in line with the club’s review process as part of a multi-disciplinary team.</p>
      <p>“Plymouth Argyle Football Club has strong values and any successful applicant must demonstrate those values through their behaviours and will ensure their team and the players also understand and adhere to those values.</p>
      <p>“Applicants must have a strong work ethic, ability to work flexibly and independently, and have a working knowledge of a professional football academy.</p>
      <p>“Candidates must hold the UEFA A License, Advanced Youth Award and have attended the FA safeguarding workshop.</p>
      <p>“We are also looking for experience within a professional football club and in a busy and fast paced environment, together with experience of player development and an ability to lead a team.”</p>
