      <p>Today, MediaTek is making a <a href="https://i.mediatek.com/mediatek-5g">big announcement</a> along with Intel. Both companies are building a partnership that will bring 5G connectivity for laptops with Intel CPUs. MediaTek is developing a 5G modem solution that will bring the next-gen connectivity to many Dell and HP laptops. This is another great step being given by the Taiwanese chipmaker, which is also set to reveal its first 5G chipset tomorrow.</p>

      <p>Don’t hold your breath for the first 5G-enabled laptops. After all, the first laptops sporting MediaTek’s 5G solution are will only arrive in 2021. That schedule coincides with other major players who are expecting to see 5G reaching a broader reach by 2021. This expansion will happen mainly because of smartphones in the budget and mid-range segment sporting 5G chipsets. However, the presence of 5G in the PC segment surely will help.</p>
