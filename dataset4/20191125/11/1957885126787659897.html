      <p>Now that we've entered the week of big sales itself, the Nintendo Switch Black Friday deals are starting to pour out. And to kick things off, you can now get a Nintendo Switch with a free Labo kit of your choice for £279.</p>
      <p>This seems to be a universal Black Friday offer as many UK retailers are running it from today. As many others are bundling games in but at a much higher cost, it's up there with one of the best <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-25-nintendo-switch-black-friday-deals-2019">Nintendo Switch Black Friday</a> deals thus far.</p>

      <p>Nintendo's crazy cardboard contraptions were given a confused sideways glance by most when they were first announced. It's classic Nintendo, though! And after some time folding together a piano or fishing rod we came away enamoured by the invention in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-04-nintendo-labo-review-an-ingenious-and-generous-cardboard-triumph">Nintendo Labo review</a>.</p>
