      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/mauricio-pochettino"><b>Pochettino</b></a> was surprisingly sacked by Spurs on Tuesday evening before the club announced Jose Mourinho as his replacement the following morning.</p>
      <p>There have been rumours that Pochettino could take over at bitter rivals Arsenal, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/former-player-keen-on-talks-as-arsenal-set-deadline-for-emery"><b>if the club decide to sack Unai Emery</b></a>, who has come under intense pressure in recent weeks – which only magnified after the 2-2 home draw with struggling Southampton on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Redknapp wrote in the <i>Daily Mail</i>: “If I was a decision-maker at Arsenal, I’d go for Mauricio Pochettino in a heartbeat.</p>
      <p>“I’m not sure I believe Poch would let his time with Tottenham stop him from taking over.</p>
      <p>“Maybe the reason Spurs decided to go for Jose Mourinho so suddenly was they felt they could not hang around, because their north London rivals might be searching for a new boss soon.</p>
      <p>“Unai Emery is under big, big pressure. I have some sympathy for him but he looks a beaten man.”</p>
