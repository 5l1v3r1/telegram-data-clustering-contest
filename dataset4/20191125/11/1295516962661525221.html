      <h1>The Mandalorian's Baby Yoda Has Ignited a Boom of Bootleg Merchandise</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:11:31+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:11</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew Housman</a></address>
      <p>One could almost hear the collective cooing from viewers the moment Baby Yoda appeared at the end of the first episode of <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-the-mandalorian/">The Mandalorian</a>. </i>The alien's glowing eyes, pointy ears and his precious little three-fingered hands have won the hearts of <i>Star Wars </i>fans from across the galaxy.</p>
      <p>The downright adorableness of Baby Yoda signals the inevitable merchandise push that accompanies every other cute <i>Star Wars </i>alien, from the Ewoks to the Porgs. However, Disney has refrained from selling any products related to Baby Yoda thus far to avoid spoiling <i>The Mandalorian</i>, and the increasing demand for a green button nose to boop for Christmas has, in turn, resulted in a bootleg market fueled by creative <i>Star Wars </i>fans making their own Baby Yoda items to sell.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.etsy.com/search?q=baby+yoda&amp;ref=pagination&amp;page=1">Etsy</a> contains pages and pages of available merchandise, ranging from prints to stuffed toys to hats and baby clothing. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/754997491/pdf-pattern-amigurumi-baby-yoda?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=baby+yoda&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-16&amp;organic_search_click=1&amp;bes=1">Crochet dolls</a>, an enduring staple of the Etsy market, are present as well, complete with those signature doe eyes and those delightful monk-like toddler clothes. Shoppers can also purchase more holiday-themed items such as <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/740810132/o-come-all-ye-forceful-force-faithful?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=baby+yoda&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-6&amp;organic_search_click=1&amp;frs=1&amp;col=1">ugly Christmas sweaters </a>and <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/741098708/baby-yoda-aka-the-child-in-pod-crib?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=baby+yoda&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-45&amp;organic_search_click=1">tree ornaments</a>, for it would be a lost opportunity to let this season go by without seeing what Baby Yoda would look like in a Santa Claus hat.</p>

      <p>Of course, no Baby Yoda merchandise collection would be complete without his signature floating cradle and his trusty bounty hunting partner. Etsy sellers have had a range of artistic interpretations of the relationship at the heart of <i>The Mandalorian</i>, whether it be <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/740100566/bounty-bros-the-mandalorian-yoda-super?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=baby+yoda&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-4&amp;organic_search_click=1&amp;bes=1&amp;col=1">whimsical hijinks</a> inspired by goofy comic strips or more straight-laced <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/739150146/star-wars-the-mandalorian-foundlings?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=baby+yoda&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-13&amp;organic_search_click=1&amp;frs=1&amp;bes=1">iconography</a>. It's clear that, despite the lack of Baby Yoda by Disney, the tiny tot is a formidable force of retail in the cottage industry.</p>

      <p>It's not just the people on Etsy that have gotten in on the hype. eBay also has an extensive selection of toys and apparel, including <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/3DM-Baby-Yoda-Figure-On-Base-from-Mandalorian-Printed/264539609342?hash=item3d97ca18fe:g:ZAgAAOSwWy5d1T4R">3D-printed figures</a>.

      <p>Artists on custom print t-shirt shops are also onboard. <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/shop/p/42528194.FB110.unisex-tee-w?grid_pos=2&amp;rbs=08768b53-aab3-434e-b8ee-9fcc949c1154&amp;ref=shop_grid&amp;searchTerm=baby%20yoda&amp;SSAID=314743&amp;utm_source=shareasale&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_campaign=banner&amp;sscid=b1k3_lhzc4">Redbubble</a> features a fit that positions a giant image with sparkling eyes front and center. Likewise, <a href="https://www.teepublic.com/t-shirt/6783344-hunting-frogs?ref_id=&amp;ref_type=&amp;sscid=b1k3_lhzip">Teepublic</a> has a shirt that references the baby's Force powers, along with his hunger for frog creatures.</p>
      <p>This spate of bootleg products is indicative of an intriguing aspect of geek culture and online fandoms. <i>Star Wars </i>has become such a popular property that fans are ahead of the curve on celebrating the franchise's latest developments. The films have always been the target of tongue-in-cheek jokes and cynical jabs about the series' relentless branding. Even before the modern age of hyper self-awareness, Mel Books' Yoda parody in <i>Spaceballs</i>, Yogurt, was selling branded lunchboxes and cereals and emphatically shouting about merchandising. Now, the cycle has come full circle, with the arrival of Baby Yoda signaling the next boom.</p>

      <p>The sellers over at Etsy, eBay and custom print e-shops, however, have revealed a deeper side of the <i>Star Wars </i>fan's relationship with the franchise. While it's true that years of <i>Star Wars </i>branding has conditioned people to associate toys and other gear with the story's characters, the line between merchandising and property has become blurred. Disney did not officially ignite the wave of Baby Yoda holiday gifts, even if the infant's cuteness was destined for licensing. No, the first big push was started by the fans, who were understandably clamoring to express their love for the little, green ball of preciousness.</p>
      <p>The Internet has allowed this type of expression to proliferate in all forms of genre and home goods. There are unsurprisingly loads of unlicensed merchandise for other geek properties like <a href="https://www.etsy.com/search?q=marvel%20merchandise">Marvel</a> and <a href="https://www.etsy.com/search?q=harry%20potter%20merchandise">Harry Potter</a>, as well. Even material that is less associated with tentpole franchises can be found on sites selling homemade items. <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/diversionsgifts/works/41475331-the-irishman-montage?carousel_pos=7&amp;p=t-shirt&amp;ref=portfolio_product_carousel&amp;ref_id=42528194&amp;style=mens&amp;rbs=08768b53-aab3-434e-b8ee-9fcc949c1154">Redbubble</a> already has shirts for the Martin' Scorcese's <i>The Irishman</i>, despite the film's lack of a wide release. The whole phenomenon is indicative of the boundless creativity of fans.</p>
      <p>That said, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/baby-yoda-apparel-accessories-toys-and-plush-are-coming.html">CNBC</a> reported that Baby Yoda merchandise will <a href="https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-the-mandalorian-baby-yoda-merchandise/">soon be available</a>, but Disney is still waiting it out and keeping its branding of <i>The Mandalorian</i> on the down-low. For now, the fans themselves have taken the first steps in ensuring that shoppers have access to a diverse slate of Baby Yoda gear, adhering to the wise words of the sage himself in accomplishing what they set out to finish. For Baby Yoda fans on Etsy and other sites where DIY sellers have control over their products, there was no try.</p>
