        <b>A joint promotion between Raspberry Pi’s Code Club programme and Aardman Animations challenged primary school students across the globe to show off their coding skills with an animation based on the Shaun the Sheep films.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The contest was open for seven weeks and any registered Code Club was eligible to enter. It closed with 683 entries from 35 countries, and from that pool, a selection of winners has been chosen.</p>

      <p>Code Club explains the competition’s brief: “create a Scratch animation of Shaun and his new alien friend Lu-La using our starter project, then remix it to add your own story and code.”</p>
      <p>A judging panel made up of representatives from Raspberry Pi and Aardman Animations chose the contest’s winners. Initially planning to highlight just 10 entries, the judges decided the overall standard of competition was so high they needed to expand the selection to 12.</p>
      <p>Winners came from clubs from across the globe, in the UK, France, Iraq, Israel, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia. “All demonstrated amazing creativity and coding skills,” Code Club said.</p>
      <p>AliceCode Code Club in Israel submitted over 40 entries, and the judges were so impressed at their quality that three winners were chosen from the club. The judges said these projects “told a very clear story” and “made excellent use of backdrops and sound effects.”</p>
      <p>Of the remaining winners, four hailed from Code Clubs in the UK. These included the Mount School York club, the Warwick Junior School club, the Worcester Park Library club and the Steiner Academy Exeter club. The projects were praised for their interactivity and story elements.</p>
