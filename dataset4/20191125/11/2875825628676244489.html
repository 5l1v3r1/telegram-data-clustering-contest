      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kylie-jenner">Kylie Jenner</a> is never one to do things by halves.</p>
      <p>And her extravagant Thanksgiving dinner party, that she threw on Sunday, proved the make-up mogul is the hostess with the mostest.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old ensured she whipped up a grand feast for the American holiday and transformed her dining area in her stunning Hidden Hills home to fit in with the harvest theme.</p>
      <p>Showcasing she is every inch the domestic goddess, Kylie pulled out all the stops as she prepared a wide selection of dishes for her friends and family to enjoy - which she documented herself cooking on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>

      <p>Kylie invited her followers into her kitchen as she showed off bowls of gooey macaroni-cheese, piles of orange yams layered between charred marshmallows, a golden turkey, mounds of mashed potatoes and various greens.</p>
      <p>Allowing her guests to dish up whatever took their fancy, she placed the food out in ornate bain-marie's where everyone scooped out the yummy delights.</p>
      <p>The businesswoman selected tasteful tablewear for the bash by decorating the dining table with gold-leaf rimmed wine glasses, metallic cutlery and crisp white roses were placed in vases down the centre table that seated sixteen guests.</p>
      <p>Each spot at the large dining table had a burnt orange ceramic pumpkin placed in-front of the diner as well as cute coloured chicks made out of paper mache eggs.</p>

      <p>Kylie's sister Kendall posted a few snaps from the party onto her Instagram account but older siblings Kim Kardashian-West, Kourtney Kardashian and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/khloe-kardashian">Khloe Kardashian</a> did not share any photos from the event.</p>
