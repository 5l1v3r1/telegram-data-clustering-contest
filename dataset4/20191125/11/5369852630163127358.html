      <p>IRELAND INTERNATIONAL <b>LEANNE Kiernan</b> found the back of the net for West Ham yesterday, but couldn’t prevent them from falling to a 3-2 defeat. </p>
      <p>The Cavan native side-footed home past her Ireland team-mate <b>Grace Maloney</b> on 65 minutes after a scramble in the box — doubling the Hammer’s advantage as Katharina Baunach had opened the scoring against Reading. </p>
      <p>However, a player down due to Rachel Rowe’s red card in first-half injury-time, West Ham conceded three times in the final 15 minutes at Rush Green Stadium. </p>
      <p>Goalkeeper<b> Courtney Brosnan</b> was on the bench for London club. </p>
      <p><b>Katie McCabe</b> helped Arsenal earn a 1-0 victory over Liverpool, but there were worries about the Ireland captain after she was substituted at half-time. </p>
      <p>24-year-old McCabe started at full-back before being withdrawn with an ankle problem. Manager Joe Montemurro confirmed that the change was precautionary, however.</p>
      <blockquote>She was feeling her ankle,” the Gunners head coach explained. </blockquote>
      <p>“She just over stretched the inside part of her ankle and she couldn’t get any power so we decided it wasn’t worth risking so we took her off.”</p>

      <p>Dutch striker Vivianne Miedema bagged the only goal of the game on 28 minutes. <b>Niamh Fahey</b> played 90 minutes at the heart of Liverpool’s defence, while <b>Louise Quinn</b> was an unused substitute for Arsenal.  </p>
      <p><b>Harriet Scott</b> was on the wrong end of a 6-0 drubbing as Chelsea made light work of Birmingham City to retain their one-point lead at the top of the table.  </p>
