      <h1>Simon Jordan slams Man Utd's decision to pursue with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</h1>
      <h2>The Norwegian boss was appointed permanent manager of the Red Devils in March following a brilliant run of form while he was temporary boss but United have struggled recently</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:37:25+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:37</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Former Crystal Palace chairman Simon Jordan believes Manchester United are making a mistake by continuing to stick by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in spite of their patchy form under the Norwegian.</p>
      <p>United showed their two faces in the 3-3 draw with Sheffield United on Sunday, doing brilliantly to come down from 2-0 down to make it 3-2 before their fragilities were exposed when they conceded a last minute equaliser.</p>
      <p>They currently sit in ninth position in the Premier League, nine points off the top four, and speaking to <a href="https://twitter.com/talkSPORT/status/1198685032082227205?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1198685032082227205&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2Fe160pd%3Fresponsive%3Dtrue%26is_nightmode%3Dfalse">talkSPORT</a> Simon said United should get rid of Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>"I look at them and think this is a very poor imitation of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> ," Jordan said.</p>

      <p>"I can't help but look at them and go 'you've got all this opportunity, all this influence, all this resource, all this prestige.</p>
      <p>"How can you allow yourself to decline to the point where the best solution you can come up with is a former player that was a substitute, who has gone on and managed Molde and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Cardiff</a> and that is your blueprint for the biggest club in the world?"</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino has been linked with a switch to Old Trafford following his sacking from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> , but it appears as though the powers that be are willing to stick with Solskjaer for the time being.</p>
      <p>His future may be decided by United's next four games, as after a Europa League game against Astana they face Aston Villa, Tottenham and bitter rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> in the Premier League.</p>

      <p>Solskjaer did not appear concerned after Sheffield United's late equaliser, saying: "Sometimes football is beyond tactics. The energy compared to ours in the first half and then we get that goal and we start to belief.</p>
      <p>"The difference in the team this year compared to last is huge. They never give in. Last year we would have gone four or five down instead of coming back. We would not have been able to come back."</p>
