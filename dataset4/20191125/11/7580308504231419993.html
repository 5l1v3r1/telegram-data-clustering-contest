      <h1>“No Time To Die” Will Be Daniel Craig’s Final James Bond Film</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:15:33+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author">Violet Johnson</a></address>
      <p>Daniel Craig is officially 00-Done with being <a href="https://guardian.ng/tag/james-bond/">James Bond</a>.</p>
      <p>In a chat with Stephen Colbert on Friday’s episode of “The Late Show”, <a href="https://youtu.be/Dq8nR7EiIXU">the actor confirmed</a> that the upcoming “<a href="https://guardian.ng/life/next-james-bond-film-to-be-titled-no-time-to-die/">No Time To Die</a>” is his last outing as the fictional British spy James Bond.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>Are you done with Bond?” Colbert asked.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“Yes,” replied Craig.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <i>“You’re done with Bond?” repeated Colbert.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“It’s done,” said Craig.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Craig debuted as Bond in 2006′s “Casino Royale” and also portrayed the character in 2008’s “Quantum of Solace,” 2012’s “Skyfall” and 2015’s “Spectre.”</p>
      <p>The longest-serving Bond had, however, initially been hesitant to reprise his role in the 25th installment of the franchise, which is slated for an April 2020 release.</p>
      <p>Craig told German website Express earlier this week that “someone else needs to have a go,” reported Esquire magazine.</p>
      <p>Although Idris Elba has repeatedly shut down rumors that he will become the <a href="https://guardian.ng/life/meet-lashanna-lynch-the-to-be-007-in-the-upcoming-james-bond-film/">first Black Bond</a>, <a href="https://guardian.ng/life/peaky-blinders-star-cillian-murphy-may-be-the-next-james-bond/">it is still unclear who will replace Craig in the role.</a></p>
      <p>Elsewhere on “The Late Show,” Craig (who was promoting his new movie “Knives Out”) taught Colbert how to speak with a Welsh accent.</p>
