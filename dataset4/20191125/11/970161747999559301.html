      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> remain confident of signing Red Bull Salzburg striker Erling Haaland despite having to deal with the youngster’s agent, Mino Raiola.</p>
      <p>Haaland is one of the most in-demand players in Europe after a blistering start to the new season, scoring 26 goals in 18 appearances in all competitions – including five hat-tricks.</p>
      <p>The likes of City and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> are believed to have spoken to Haaland’s camp, though his father, Alf-Inge, was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/erling-haalands-father-visits-carrington-amid-manchester-united-transfer-speculation-11176147/">recently spotted at United’s Carrington training ground</a>.</p>

      <p>Haaland already has a good relationship with compatriot Solskjaer, having worked under the United manager at Molde, while his father’s playing days at City will have no bearing on his decision.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://theathletic.com/1398545/2019/11/25/ornstein-on-monday-raiola-complicates-united-pursuit-of-haaland-adidas-gives-mourinho-special-treatment-rogue-firms-exploit-premier-league-clubs-bruce-shelves-new-book/">The Athletic</a>, a number of figures at United are now ‘convinced’ that Haaland will end up at United, despite having enlisted Raiola as his agent.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The Red Devils’ hierarchy have a somewhat uneasy relationship with Raiola, who brokered deals for Paul Pogba, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and others to move to Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Sir Alex Ferguson had been reluctant to deal with him, though that stance softened after he stepped down, while he is currently at loggerheads with United over the future of Pogba – who only has 18 months left on his contract and does not want to renew.</p>
      <p>While the relationship between United and Raiola is often cited as being tense, <i>The Athletic</i> say the two parties ‘remain on good terms’.</p>

      <p>There are a long list of suitors for Haaland and United will have to face off fierce competition, and it has been suggested they could sign the 19-year-old in January and then <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/manchester-united-willing-loan-erling-haaland-back-rb-salzburg-complete-transfer-11166265/">loan him back</a> to Salzburg for the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>As well as obliterating the Austrian league, Haaland has shown his Champions League credentials with seven goals in the tournament already – including a strike against Liverpool at Anfield.</p>
