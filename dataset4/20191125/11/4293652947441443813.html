      <p><i>Sportsnet’s</i> Iain MacIntyre reported last week that Roussel, 30, has been practising with the Canucks and could make his season debut before the end of their six-game road trip, which wraps up against the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Roussel had 31 points in 65 games with the Canucks last season, his first in Vancouver after signing a four-year, $12-million deal during the 2018 off-season.</p>
      <p>He tore the ACL in his right knee after a collision with the New York Rangers’ Brendan Lemieux during a game last March.</p>
      <p>Roussel previously played six seasons with the Dallas Stars, and has amassed 172 points across 478 NHL games.</p>
