        <b>Intel may be working on their own video game controller. A recently released patent shows that the Intel controller appears to be designed after PlayStation’s DualShock 4.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Picked up by familiar face <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/spelcomputers-games/intel-game-controller-cloud-gaming/">LetsGoDigital</a>, the patent was officially filed by Intel Corporation back in May, 2018. The document was published on November 19th, 2019.</p>
      <p>The Intel controller is definitely an intriguing design. Its body appears elongated from the DualShock but features many of the features from Sony’s GamePad.</p>
      <p>Bottom-placed analogue sticks are present, traditional button placements are there, and so is PlayStation’s <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/these-playstation-4-controller-prototypes-may-have-been-forged-in-the-depths-of-hell/">iconic DualShock 4 touchbar</a>.</p>
      <p>What is different are the bumper and triggers. Opting for a diagonal placement – which should follow the fingers’ natural placement – the buttons also appear shallower.</p>

      <p>With Intel leaning heavily into the recently announced Tencent Cloud Streaming, Intel’s GamePad could be used for the variety of cloud gaming services that the tech company has a hand in.</p>
      <p>From Tencent’s streaming service to Google Stadia, Intel’s technology is all over the upcoming slew of streaming services.</p>
