      <h1>Obese teenagers show signs of brain damage, MRI scans show </h1>

      <p>Obese teenagers show signs of brain damage, research has found. </p>
      <p>Scans comparing their brains those with adolescents of healthy weight found inflammation in the white matter, which may make it harder for them to control their eating habits. . </p>
      <p>MRI scans of the brains showed changes in the areas related to control of emotions, and feelings of reward. </p>
      <p>Such changes could encourage excess eating, scientists said,</p>
      <p>The findings presented at the Radiological Society of North America meeting in Chicago are based on MRI scans of 12 to 16 year-olds.</p>
      <p>Co-author Dr Pamela Bertolazzi, a biomedical scientist at Sao Paulo University in Brazil, said: "Brain changes found in obese adolescents related to important regions responsible for control of appetite, emotions and cognitive functions."</p>
      <p>The scans were used to examine the condition of white matter in the 120 participants - 59 of whom were obese and 61 healthy.</p>
      <p>Researchers assessed a measure called fractional anisotropy, which correlates with the condition of the brain’s white matter - with less of it indicating damage to the white matter. </p>
      <p>The results showed such changes in the obese individuals, in the regions in the corpus callosum - a bundle of nerve fibres that connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain.</p>
      <p>A decrease was also found in the middle orbitofrontal gyrus, an area related to emotional control and the reward circuit.</p>
      <p>And there was a relationship between the pattern of damage and inflammatory markers like leptin, a hormone made by fat cells that helps regulate energy levels and fat stores.</p>
      <p>In some obese people, the brain does not respond to leptin, causing them to keep eating despite adequate or excessive fat stores.</p>
      <p>This condition, known as leptin resistance, makes the fat cells produce even more leptin.</p>
      <p>Worsening condition of the white matter was also associated with levels of insulin, a hormone produced in the pancreas that helps regulate blood sugar levels. </p>
      <p>Obese people often suffer from insulin resistance, a state in which the body is resistant to the effects of the hormone.</p>
      <p>Dr Bertolazzi said: "Our maps showed a positive correlation between brain changes and hormones such as leptin and insulin.</p>
      <p>"Furthermore, we found a positive association with inflammatory markers, which leads us to believe in a process of neuro-inflammation besides insulin and leptin resistance."</p>
      <p>She called for more studies to establish if this inflammation in young obese people is a consequence of the structural changes in the brain.</p>
      <p>The researcher added: "In the future, we would like to repeat brain MRI in these adolescents after multi-professional treatment for weight loss to assess if the brain changes are reversible or not."</p>
      <p>Last month a study of 2,700 nine to 11 year olds in the US found those with weight problems were likely to do worse in problem-solving and memory tests.</p>
      <p>They had a thinner cortex - the brain region important for reasoning. Similar structural brain changes are seen in middle-aged people as they get older.</p>
      <p>The Cambridge University team said fatty diet may cause damaging inflammation at a time when a child's brain is still developing.</p>
      <p>But another theory is they had different brains before they became obese, which made fatty and sugary foods more rewarding and reduced their willpower, while also affecting their thinking abilities.</p>
      <p>In the UK, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/10/obesity-among-10-year-olds-hits-record-high/">one in five children are obese or overweight by the time they leave primary school</a>.</p>
