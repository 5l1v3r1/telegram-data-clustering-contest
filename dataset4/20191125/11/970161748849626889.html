      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> will become <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>’s ‘poodle’ if the Tories the election, the Lib Dems have said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chuka-umunna/">Chuka Umunna</a> will give a speech today attacking the prime minister, saying he will become increasingly reliant on the US president if he takes the UK out of the EU.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats have set themselves as the party of Remain, vowing to cancel <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> if they win a majority government on 12 December.</p>
      <p>Mr Umunna, the party’s spokesman on foreign affairs, is expected to say in a speech today that Mr Johnson will pay a ‘high price’ for a close relationship with America if he does manage to ‘get Brexit done’.</p>
      <p>Under their manifesto promises, the Lib Dems will outspend the Tories by £340 million in 2024-25.</p>
      <p>The party has committed to spending extra money on defence and aid if they win, claiming that the defence budget will be almost £1 billion more in 2024-25 under them than the Tories.</p>

      <p>They will spend 2% of GDP on defence, the party have pledged, and will also maintain the current commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on International Aid.</p>

      <p>The party will do that thanks to the economic boost which they say will result from staying in the EU.</p>
      <p>In his speech in Watford, Mr Umunna is expected to say: ‘Not only will we cease to be that important bridge between the EU and the US but by withdrawing from the European Union, inevitably Johnson will become more reliant on Trump in the short term if he is re-elected.</p>
      <p>‘Johnson is desperate to secure a US trade deal to make up for the damage done to our global standing if Brexit happens.</p>
      <p>‘From my own contacts with the US Government, it is clear a high price will be demanded and close alignment with US rules and regulation demanded – we risk becoming a vassal state of the US if Boris Johnson gets a majority.</p>
      <p>‘Leave the EU and the UK under Johnson will become President Trump’s poodle. That is what is at stake at this election.’</p>

      <p>Mr Umunna is expected to say Mr Johnson is ‘following the Trump playbook’ and has become part of ‘this global network of populist, right wing, authoritarian nationalists’.</p>
      <p>He will add: ‘Giving Johnson a majority is to give carte blanche to this type of politics in the UK – something which should worry us all.’</p>
      <p>Based on costings of each of the main parties’ manifestos, it has emerged that<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/every-1-tories-promise-spend-labour-say-will-spend-32-11213754/"> Labour will spend £32 for every £1</a> the Tories would spend if they win the election.</p>

      <p>Jeremy Corbyn’s party has pledged a huge swathe of funding for public services which would cost billions of pounds each year, while the Conservative Party’s entire spending plans add up to just under £3 billion extra by 2024.</p>
      <p>But the Labour leader told Metro.co.uk that Mr Johnson’s manifesto was the ‘same old same old’ from the Tories and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/jeremy-corbyn-says-people-will-continue-die-streets-tory-manifesto-11210008/">will not stop people ‘dying on the streets’</a> because of austerity.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn tore into the party’s record on poverty, saying: ‘We are not a poor country, that should simply not happen.’</p>
