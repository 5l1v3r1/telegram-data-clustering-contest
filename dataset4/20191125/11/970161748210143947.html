      <p>Schools, childcare and student fees are key issues that the major parties have placed at the heart of their manifestos.</p>
      <p>Here’s where they stand on education policy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Conservatives</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Conservatives have pledged to spend £14 billion on schools, which it claims will equate to £5,000 for each secondary school pupils and at least £4,000 for each primary school pupil.</p>
      <p>The party has also promised a £30,000 starting salary for teachers as well as an expansion of free schools.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson also said the party would invest £3 billion in a new national skills fund as well as £2 billion for a ‘college estates upgrade’.</p>

        <b>Labour</b>
      </p>
      <p>Although the party made headlines after a motion was passed at its annual conference in September to ban private schools, under the party’s current proposals, it doesn’t look like a ban will be coming into force any time soon.</p>
      <p>However, the party has pledged to close tax loopholes currently enjoyed by private schools and charge VAT on school fees.</p>
      <p>Ofsted and Sats tests at Key Stage 1 and 2 will also be abolished.</p>

      <p>In a reversal of Tory policy, the party has said it will return the power of running schools to councils and head teachers rather than academy bosses.</p>
      <p>Labour is also promising 150,000 more early years staff and to cap class sizes at 30.</p>
      <p>The party is also reaching out to younger voters by promising to abolish tuition fees and bring back maintenance grants.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Liberal Democrats</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats are promising 35 hours a week free childcare for working parents from the day their child turns nine months as well as 20,000 extra teachers.</p>
      <p>The party is also promising to scrap mandatory SATs and replace existing government ‘league tables’ of schools with a ‘broader set of indicators’.</p>

      <p>The Greens have said they will increase funding for schools by at least £4 billion a year and vowed to cut class sizes to under 40 in the long term.</p>
      <p>The Party says it will also end centrally-imposed testing and Ofsted inspections.</p>
      <p>In line with Labour, it has also vowed to levy VAT and tax on private schools.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Brexit Party</b>

      <p>In a bid to attract younger voters, the party’s ‘Contract with the people’, also says it will abolish student loan interest, as well as ending the target to get 50% of young people into higher education.</p>
