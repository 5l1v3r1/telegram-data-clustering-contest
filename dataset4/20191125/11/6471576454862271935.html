      <p>This weekend, the machine officially took the start in the race, trying to battle-prove both the powertrain and architecture of the upcoming production Bronco. The car is also a tribute to the 50th anniversary of Bronco claiming the only overall 4x4 win to date at the Baja 1000 in 1969.</p>
      <p><i>‚ÄúBronco‚Äôs win at Baja in 1969 was epic, something that even after 50 years has not been repeated,‚Äù </i>said in a statement Hau Thai-Tang, Ford chief product development and purchasing officer.</p>
      <p><i>‚ÄúRugged endurance racing is such a big part of Bronco heritage. The Baja 1000 gives us not only the perfect setting to honor Rod Hall‚Äôs win, it also provides an authentic testbed to demonstrate our upcoming Bronco‚Äôs desert racing capability and durability.‚Äù<br/><br/></i>Reports suggest that the race car has somewhat failed to impress in the first part of the event.</p>
      <p>Despite the Bronco R already in the open, there are some things that we still don‚Äôt officially know about it, like for example how big of an engine and how powerful hides under the hood.</p>
      <p>The revealing of the Bronco R at the beginning of the month confirmed <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/uaw-document-virtually-confirms-2021-ford-bronco-two-door-four-door-models-138787.html">information leaked</a> by a UAW document that the revived nameplate will be offered not only in four-door configuration, but also two-door.</p>
      <p>That‚Äôs a major nod the original off-roader of the 1960s, which was presented by Ford as a two-door compact <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/s.html#ge-sport-utility-vehicle"><u>SUV</u></a>.</p>
      <p>The Blue Oval is scheduled to revive the <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/search.php?t=cars&amp;s=ford+bronco">Bronco</a> years after it was discontinued in 1996 next year, greatly expanding the offering in the SUV segment and at the same time bringing back one of the most notorious names in its portfolio. üèÅ</p>

        <summary>PRESS RELEASE</summary>
        <p>23 NOVEMBER 2019</p>
        <p>As its new Bronco R race prototype takes to the course at the famed SCORE Baja 1000, Ford has been named Official Truck and SUV of SCORE-International Off-Road Racing.</p>
        <p>The collaboration between Ford and SCORE officially begins with the running of the SCORE Baja 1000, and extends through the end of the 2022 SCORE World Desert Challenge Series season. It comes as the Bronco R race prototype ‚Äì revealed earlier this month in Nevada ‚Äì lines up to take on the grueling desert course. Driven by an all-star team that includes defending Baja 1000 Trophy Truck champion Cameron Steele, Bronco R aims to prove out the upcoming production Bronco‚Äôs powertrain and architecture.</p>
        <p>‚ÄúWorking with SCORE makes great sense based on our truck, SUV and off-road heritage, and especially with some of our future Ford trucks and SUVs including the reveal of the new Bronco next spring,‚Äù said Mark Rushbrook, global director, Ford Performance motorsports. ‚ÄúVehicles like our F-150 Raptor and all-new Bronco are built to live and play in the sand of Baja.‚Äù</p>
        <p>The relationship makes Ford lead sponsor of 13 races in the SCORE World Desert Challenge Series, which includes the 2019-22 SCORE Baja 1000 races, as well as the 2020-22 SCORE Baja 400, SCORE Baja 500 and San Felipe 250 events.</p>
        <p>As part of the agreement, Ford will have a presence at other SCORE-related events such as the Lucas Oil Off-Road Expo held annually in Pomona, California.</p>
        <p>The Bronco R race prototype ‚Äì developed by Ford Performance in collaboration with Geiser Performance of Phoenix ‚Äì was built in part to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Bronco claiming the only overall 4x4 win to date at the Baja 1000 in 1969.</p>
