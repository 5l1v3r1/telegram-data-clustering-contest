      <p>David Alaba will miss Bayern Munich's Champions League trip to Red Star Belgrade as his partner is expecting the birth of their child.</p>
      <p>The Austria defender is not part of the travelling party for Tuesday's Group B fixture, in a match where already qualified Bayern will clinch top spot with a victory.</p>
      <p>Alaba has been filling in at centre-back for Bayern in recent matches due to long-term injuries to Lucas Hernandez and Niklas Sule, while Jerome Boateng missed wins over Borussia Dortmund and Fortuna Dusseldorf through suspension.</p>
      <p>Michael Cuisance is also missing from Hansi Flick's Bayern squad, with the French midfielder unavailable due to illness.</p>
