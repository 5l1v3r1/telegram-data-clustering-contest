      <h1>Club want Stoke City to reduce demands as they look to ‘finish’ transfer deal</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.fanatik.com.tr/trabzonspor-badou-ndiaye-icin-gozunu-karartti-2103501">Fanatik</a> have reported on the latest developments with regards to Trabzonspor’s pursuit of Stoke City midfielder Badou Ndiaye.</p>
      <p>The Senegal international, who previously played in Turkey for Osmanlispor and Galatasaray, is said to be keen on a return to the Turkish Super Lig and Fanatik claim both sides are still at the negotiation table.</p>
      <p>It’s reported Stoke are looking to get €1m from a loan deal for the 29 year old and Ndiaye wants a €1.5m salary for the six months.</p>
      <p>However, Trabzonspor are looking to reduce both Stoke’s loan fee and Ndiaye’s wage demands, and both parties will hold further meetings in the near future. There have been recent reports the Trabzon club could be priced out of a deal for the player.</p>
      <p>The Turkish club are now looking to ‘finish’ this transfer by paying €1.5m in total (loan fee and wages) but it’s reported Stoke City are in no rush to part ways with him.</p>
      <p>Ndiaye has made 10 appearances in the Championship this season and is under contract with the club until June 2022.</p>
