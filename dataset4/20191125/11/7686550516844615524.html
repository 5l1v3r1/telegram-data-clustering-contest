      <p>After an unsettled start to the week, polar air will surge into Wales by Thursday sending temperatures plummeting.</p>
      <p>Those heading out to Christmas markets and Black Friday shopping will be in for quite a shock with temperatures in the single digits late this week.</p>
      <p>But before the arrival of cold air, an unsettled weather pattern will grip much of the country.</p>
      <p>The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for rain across south Wales on Tuesday and Wednesday, as heavy showers threaten to drench commuters and snarl traffic.</p>

      <p>Downpours may also lead to flooding where up to 40mm of rain fall through Wednesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>But a shift in the weather pattern is forecast for the latter half of the week, which will leave Wales feeling much more like mid-winter than late autumn.</p>
      <p>Met Office spokesman Oli Claydon said: "In terms of a broad outlook, certainly for the main part of this working week, it will remain unsettled and relatively mild.</p>
      <p>"But there are indications that at the end of the week we'll see colder conditions moving into the whole of the UK."</p>

      <p>A large area of high pressure is forecast to slowly sink southward, allowing notably cooler air to move into northern Wales on Thursday, especially overnight, he said.</p>
      <p>That high pressure will shift farther south from Friday into Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Where temperatures readings were in the mid teens early in the week, the mercury is likely to drop several degrees by Friday.</p>
      <p>"In north Wales, we're looking at 10 or 11 degrees possibly [in the early part of the week]," Claydon said.</p>
      <p>"That starts to move into the single digits by Friday, and the nights will be even colder."</p>

      <p>Rural northern areas of the country will drop to freezing from Friday into Saturday.</p>
      <p>In Aberystwyth, which will hover around 13 degrees early this week, highs will sink to seven or eight degrees by Saturday and Sunday.</p>
      <p>Overnight, lows are expected to be a chilly three degrees.</p>
      <p>Father south, including in Cardiff, temperatures in the lower teens on Monday will drop to a high of just six degrees by Sunday.</p>
      <p>The polar air will send commuters and early rising Black Friday shoppers reaching for scarves and gloves late this week.</p>
      <p>Those who have held out on using the heating so far this season may well give in by the weekend.</p>

      <h3>Will the cold air stick around?</h3>
      <p>Forecasters say it's too soon to tell whether the cold air will stick around into next month, but it will certainly hang on to close out the week.</p>
      <p>After Sunday, there's much less certainty about the forecast.</p>
      <p>As the calendar flips to December, signs suggest temperatures will remain rather cold, especially in the north of the UK, according to the Met Office.</p>
      <p>Their long-range prediction suggests rather cold air will remain entrenched in the north, with widespread frost and ice likely.</p>
      <p>"The beginning of December looks to remain cold for many, as the potential for wintry showers in the north continues and may spread to higher ground in the south," it said.</p>
