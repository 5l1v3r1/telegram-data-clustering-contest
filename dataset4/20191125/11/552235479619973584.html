      <p>A lorry driver accused over the deaths of 39 migrants has pleaded guilty to plotting to assist illegal immigration.</p>
      <p>Maurice Robinson, 25, who was <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/mum-who-drowned-ivf-twin-20954420">allegedly</a> part of a global smuggling ring, is charged with the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/mum-who-drowned-ivf-twin-20954420">manslaughter</a> of a group of men, women and children found dead in a refrigerated trailer.</p>

      <p>Robinson, who is known as Mo, appeared at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/mum-who-drowned-ivf-twin-20954420">Old Bailey</a> via video link from Belmarsh prison for a plea hearing.</p>
      <p>Wearing a light blue sweater and tan trousers, he spoke to confirm his identity and British nationality.</p>
      <p>During the hearing before Mr Justice Edis, he admitted conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration between May 1 2018 and October 24 2019.</p>
      <p>The charge states that he plotted with others to do "an act or series of acts which facilitated the commission of a breach of immigration law by various persons".</p>
      <p>He also admitted acquiring criminal property - namely cash - on the same dates.</p>
      <p>The defendant, of Laurel Drive in Craigavon in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/mum-who-drowned-ivf-twin-20954420">Northern Ireland</a> , was not asked to enter pleas to other charges, including 39 counts of manslaughter.</p>
      <p>He is charged with conspiracy to commit human trafficking offences between May 1 2018 and October 24 2019.</p>
      <p>The details of that charge state that he "arranged or facilitated the travel of other persons into the UK with a view to their being exploited".</p>
      <p>He is also charged with transferring criminal property.</p>
      <p>The defendant was remanded into custody until a further hearing on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/mum-who-drowned-ivf-twin-20954420">December 13</a> .</p>
