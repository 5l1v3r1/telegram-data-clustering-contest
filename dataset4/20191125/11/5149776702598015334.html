      <h1>Notts chippy The Jolly Fryer is bringing back foot-long pigs in blankets</h1>
      <h2>This year's new addition makes it a Sunday dinner and a chippy dinner all in one</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:14:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:14</time> by <a rel="author">Lynette Pinchess</a></address>
      <p>Chip lovers' Christmas favourite, foot-long battered pigs in blankets, will be returning to Notts chippy The Jolly Fryers on Sunday (December 1).</p>
      <p>The giant bangers are wrapped in five rashers of bacon, dipped in batter and deep-fried at the chippy in Lowmoor Road, Kirkby-in-Ashfield.</p>
      <p>Customers will be able to get their festive fix throughout December - this year with the added option of being served in a giant Yorkshire pudding with chips and gravy.</p>
      <p>Owner Theo Tsiolas said: "It's a massive festive treat and people go wild for them. We sold 2,000 last year.</p>

      <p>"I think the Yorkshire puddings will be huge. It's Sunday dinner combined with a chippy dinner - it's a match made in heaven."</p>
      <p>And if this all sounds very familiar it is because NottinghamshireLive reported on exactly the same battered extravaganza at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/epic-foot-long-battered-pigs-3541386">Bestwood Fisheries.</a></p>
      <p>But there's no rivalry... except a smidgen of sibling rivalry as the two owners are brothers.</p>
      <p>Antonio Tsiolas, who runs the Bestwood chippy, came up with the idea and shared it with Theo last year.</p>

      <p>He said: "There's only friendly sibling rivalry. We speak about 30 times a day!"</p>
      <p>The pigs in blankets went on sale at the chip shop in Arnold Road yesterday and proved as popular as ever.</p>
      <p>"We sold 200 foot-long ones and 100 of the regular ones. The Yorkshire puddings proved really popular," said Antonio.</p>
