      <p>Five new bull bison have joined the herd at the Old Man on His Back Ranch, putting the Nature Conservancy of Canada (NCC) one step closer to their goal of doubling the size of the original herd.</p>
      <p>“We have a general goal of about 100 adult breeding individuals,” said Mike Burak, a conservation manager for NCC in Saskatchewan. “We’re still waiting to kind of iron that out a bit more to make sure the property itself can handle that.”</p>
      <p>Based on soil types and climate, the NCC can estimate the general amount of grass an area can produce and then factor in how much grass a bison eats in a day to determine the capacity of the land.</p>
      <p>Burak said 40 to 60 per cent of the land should also be left ungrazed to provide natural habitat and natural grazing for the other wildlife that lives and moves through the area.</p>
      <p>The five new additions are part of a revamping of the NCC’s management plan, which aims to mimic a more natural environment.</p>
      <p>“With growing the herd, the easiest thing to do to bump your numbers up would be just to hold back some of our own calves, but the problem with that is we run into problems with related individuals breeding,” said Burak.</p>
      <p>Breeding within the herd can result in more sickly, less hearty or healthy bison that are more susceptible to things like disease. A generally weaker animal, they also don’t do as well over the winter.</p>
      <p>The five new bulls, two from Saskatchewan and three from central Alberta, were born in 2017 and were added to dilute that effect and help maintain the health of the herd.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/old-man-on-his-back-ranch-celebrates-20-years-of-conservation">In 2003, 50 two-year old plains bison were transported from Elk Island National Park in central Alberta to Old Man on His Back.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Genetically-pure, the bison were introduced as the native grazer to the area with the goal of maintaining and enhancing biodiversity.</p>
      <p>Two hours south of Swift Current, the ranch stretches across 13,095 acres of historic grasslands, part of the Milk River Basin, and is the only watershed that drains into the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
      <p>It has also became home some of the darkest night skies in North America.</p>
      <p>The ranch has grown some since then. It is now home to a total of about 80 bison — 58 cows, 12 bulls including the five new ones and nine to 10 yearlings.</p>
      <p>“Part of growing the herd is beefing up the numbers of younger individuals because eventually we are going to see those numbers start to drop off naturally just from the natural life cycle,” said Burak.</p>
      <p>A natural herd has a specific balance of young, adult and older bison, he added.</p>
      <p>Out in nature there would usually be a “fair number” of younger bison (yearlings and calves), but they can be more easily picked off by predators, said Burak. The same goes for the older bison. As a result, the highest number of bison in a herd tend to be adult bison.</p>
      <p>The ratio at Old Man on His Back is currently leaning toward the older crowd (10 years old plus), according to Burak – something they hope to rectify as the herd continues to grow.</p>
      <p>The NCC is in the process of naming the five new bulls. In a poll that wrapped up last week, members of the public were asked to vote on which theme should be used to choose names.</p>
      <p>Outlaw Country Singers won with 38 per cent of the vote, followed by Looney Tunes Characters, Action Movie Stars and New Kids on the Block, in that order.</p>
      <p>Burak said the NCC might go ahead and choose the names themselves based on the poll or take to Twitter again to narrow down which outlaw country singers the public prefers. There’s no timeline for a final decision yet, he said.</p>
      <p>“I would definitely encourage people to come out and have a look at the bison herd,” said Burak. “Especially now with these five new individuals. They’re very interesting to sit and watch.”</p>
