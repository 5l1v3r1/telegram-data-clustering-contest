      <p><b>BUCHAREST -</b> Incumbent Klaus Iohannis won re-election as Romanian president on Sunday, confirming the pro-European trajectory of the eastern EU member state.<br/><br/>Thirty years after the fall of communism, the center-right former physics professor won slightly more than 63 percent of the vote with 95 percent of ballots counted.<br/><br/>His opponent, Social Democrats (PSD) leader and former prime minister Viorica Dancila, received the remaining 37 percent, the worst-ever result for her party, which has dominated post-communist Romania.<br/><br/>"I promise to be a president for all Romanians... A modern, European, normal Romania won today," a jubilant Iohannis said.<br/><br/>The 60-year-old from the German minority, who already staged a surprise win over the PSD in 2014, has campaigned to help build functioning institutions without corruption.<br/><br/>The election was fought against a backdrop of deep resentment over controversial judicial reforms seen to benefit PSD politicians, which led to massive street protests and irked Brussels.<br/><br/>The PSD-led government collapsed in October in a no-confidence vote, capping months of political uncertainty under the left-wing party.<br/><br/>Stan Mihai, a 76-year-old pensioner who voted in the capital Bucharest, told AFP that Sunday's vote was "a choice for the well-being of Romania".<br/><br/>"We're waiting for a revolution, for things to get better. But we are waiting for this, and nothing comes our way," he said.<br/><br/>A total of 18.2 million Romanians were eligible to vote, including a record 650,000 voters abroad.<br/><br/>Part of a four million-strong diaspora who have emigrated in search of better paying jobs, they tend to favor liberal candidates. -AFP</p>
