      <p>A beggar in Blackpool was described as taking no notice of warnings given to him about his behaviour by police.</p>
      <p>Andrew Darlington, unemployed, 38, of Shannon Street, Blackpool, pleaded guilty to five offences of begging.</p>
      <p>He was given an 18 months conditional discharge and ordered to pay £85 costs plus £21 victims’ surcharge.</p>
      <p>Presiding magistrate, Nora Sopworth, told him: “This is wholly unacceptable behaviour.”</p>
      <p>Prosecutor, Pam Smith, said police saw Darlington begging on Blackpool Promenade five times between September 16 and 25.</p>
      <p>On the first occasion, an officer saw him sitting on the ground asking people for money.</p>
      <p>When spoken to by the officer, Darlington apologised and walked away but the same officer saw him begging again later that day.</p>
      <p>When told he was going to be reported for begging Darlington told the officer “Don’t do that.”</p>
      <p>After that he was seen begging on three more occasions and police took a photograph of him committing the offence.The prosecutor said: “He is described as a regular beggar in</p>
      <p>Blackpool who takes no notice of warnings by the police.”</p>
      <p>Patrick Nelligan, defending, said his client, who had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, had had problems receiving Universal Credit benefit at the time and was short of money.</p>
      <p>Mr Nelligan added: “He took the option of asking people for money rather than stealing. He says he will not be doing it again.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Steven Griffin, 37, criminal damage</b>
      </p>
      <p>A man threw a brick through the front window of his ex partner’s home.</p>
      <p>Steven Griffin was drunk at the time and believed he had been assaulted by the woman during a doorstep altercation.</p>
      <p>However, that was not the case, magistrates heard and Griffin, 37, of Dinmore Avenue,Blackpool was unharmed.</p>
      <p>The hotel night porter admitted criminal damage and magistrates requested a pre-sentence report from probation.</p>
      <p>His lawyer Steven Townley told the court: “He was intoxicated at the time. There was no-one in the front room when he threw the brick.</p>
      <p>“In his drunken stupor he thought he had been stabbed but that was not the case.”</p>

      </p>

      <p>Officers went to warn him about his behaviour and saw he appeared to be under the influence of alcohol and drugs.</p>
      <p>He struggled when arrested and at the police station two small bags of cocaine were found in his possession.</p>
      <p>Robert Castle, defending, said his client had little recollection of what had taken place.</p>
      <p>Morton apologised for what he had done and said he only had himself to blame.</p>
