        <b>Kendall Jenner jokes about starting a family on her Instagram while she uploaded some adorable snaps with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s kids. Well did her followers get the joke?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kendall Jenner is a fabulous, fun and quite a busy aunt and this recent picture is our proof. Just a while ago, Jenner uploaded some adorable snaps with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s kids – Saint West and Psalm West. In the pictures, she is seen having a fun time as an aunt while she babysits Kim and Kayne’s kids. However, as the picture has sent out hearts into aflutter, Jenner's caption and one of the pictures of her close friend/ rumoured beau Fai Khadra grabbed our attention as she then joked about starting a family. Why so?</p>
      <p>Well, while sharing the picture on her handle, she asked her fans and followers if she and Fai should start a family. She captioned the pictures as, “Everyone in favour of Fai and I starting a family say “I.” The moment she uploaded the pictures, her friends Gigi Hadid, Hailey Baldwin Bieber and her mother Kris Jenner, her half-sister Kim Kardashian and her real sister Kylie Jenner all want her to start a family as they commented ‘I’ on the comment section.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Kendall is an aunt to Kourtney Kardashian’s kids Mason, Penelope and Reign. Kim Kardashian’s 4 kids - North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm while Khloe Kardashian’s daughter True. Rob’s little girl Dream, and Kylie’s baby Stormi.</p>

      <p>Being an aunt of so many kids seems adorable, right? But we wonder how much she has to go through also. Kendall is the only KarJenner sibling who is yet to have kids, but knowing her relationship with Fai, we’re sure she’ll have a perfect family.<br/><br/>Image source: Instagram/ kendalljenner</p>
