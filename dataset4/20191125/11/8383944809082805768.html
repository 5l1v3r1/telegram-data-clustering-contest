      <p>Turkish security forces have seized weapons and ammunition belonging to the PKK terror group and its Syrian offshoot the People's Protection Units (YPG), and have discovered a new tunnel network used by the terrorists in the east and north of Syria.<br/><br/>As part of ongoing anti-terror operations to find the PKK/KCK terror group's shelters, gendarmerie forces seized two Kalashnikov infantry rifles and some ammunition in eastern Van province's Sözveren district, said the Governor's Office in a statement Monday.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the military discovered another tunnel network in the northern Syrian town of Ras Al-Ayn, which was recently liberated from the YPG/PKK terrorist group as a part of the Turkish-led Operation Peace Spring.<br/><br/>"During search and sweep operations by our heroic soldiers in Ras al-Ayn, a new tunnel network belonging to the PKK/YPG terrorist group was discovered," the Turkish Defense Ministry said in a statement on Twitter.<br/><br/>The ministry also shared photos of the newly-discovered tunnel.<br/><br/>YPG/PKK terrorists dug the tunnels to flee the approaching Turkish troops and to infiltrate and ambush them.<br/><br/>Similar tunnels were discovered in Afrin, northern Syria by the Turkish army after its villages were cleared of terrorists by the Turkish-led Operation Olive Branch and Operation Peace Spring.<br/><br/>Since 2016, Turkey has carried out three successful operations in northern Syria against YPG/PKK terrorists and Daesh: Operation Euphrates Shield (2016-17), Operation Olive Branch (2018), and Operation Peace Spring (2019).<br/><br/>Operation Peace Spring was launched on Oct. 9 to eliminate the YPG/PKK from northern Syria east of the Euphrates River in order to secure Turkey's borders, aid in the safe return of Syrian refugees, and ensure Syria's territorial integrity.<br/><br/>Ankara and Washington reached a deal on Oct. 17 to pause the operation for 120 hours to allow the withdrawal of YPG/PKK terrorists from a planned northern Syria safe zone.<br/><br/>On Oct. 22, Turkey also reached an agreement with Russia to allow the YPG/PKK terror group to withdraw from the safe zone.<br/><br/>Turkey wants to repatriate some two million Syrian refugees it is currently hosting to the zone after clearing it of terrorists.<br/><br/>In its more than 30-year terror campaign against Turkey, the PKK – listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union – has been responsible for the deaths of over 40,000 people, including women, children, and infants.</p>
