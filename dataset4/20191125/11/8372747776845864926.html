      <p>Officers say the kittens are safe and recovering at the Arizona Humane Society.</p>
      <p>It's unclear at this time if anyone will face charges in connection with the incident.</p>
      <p>And, Phoenix police weren't the only heroes making news. Earlier Sunday morning, Phoenix firefighters and Chandler police were able to save a dog stuck in a canal in Chandler.</p>
