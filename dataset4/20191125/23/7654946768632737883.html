      <p>The Rangers are aiming for Mika Zibanejad to return for Wednesday’s matchup with the Hurricanes.</p>
      <p>It was announced Monday morning Zibanejad would miss his 13th consecutive game. He is still nursing an upper-body injury from a hit he took from the Bruins’ Patrice Bergeron on Oct. 27. He was a full participant in morning skate, but coach David Quinn said the training staff is aiming for their next game.</p>
      <p>“We’ll see, this was one step in the right direction to be out there for the whole skate and skate afterwards,” Zibanejad said. “I think you guys are getting tired of this, but we’ll take it day by day.”</p>
      <p>Zibanejad, who has nine goals and four assists through nine games this season, wouldn’t disclose details about his injury. But he said he wouldn’t blame his prolonged absence on a setback. He said he’s tried to keep a positive outlook but “it’s been difficult at times.”</p>
      <p>“Obviously I’ve been feeling better,” Zibanejad said. “Toward the end I’ve been feeling really good, just still a little process of how we’re going about things. Can’t thank the trainers enough for even their patience, it’s not easy. Their job is to keep us healthy and try to help us out with that. I know as much as they love their work, they probably want to see all the guys on the ice and all healthy.”</p>

      <p>Quinn said center Boo Nieves would be inserted in the lineup Monday night after being called up from AHL Hartford on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He will replace Greg McKegg, who left Saturday’s game with a lower-body injury.</p>
      <p>Nieves, who skated in 43 games with the Rangers last season, said he woke up after a long road trip with the Wolf Pack and accidentally missed the call to tell him he had been brought up. He instead read a text informing him he was headed to New York.</p>
      <p>“It was a really nice text to wake up to,” Nieves said.</p>
      <p>Since the Rangers drafted Nieves with the 59th-overall pick in 2012, he has 19 points (five goals, 14 assists) in 72 NHL games.</p>
      <p>“Boo brings a speed element to the game, for sure,” Quinn said. “Just a consistency with that and his physical play. When he does that, he’s a good player at this level.”</p>
