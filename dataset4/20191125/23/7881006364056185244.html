      <p><b>CHENNAI: </b>The state government’s persistent opposition to the Dam Safety Bill on the grounds that it would affect Tamil Nadu’s ownership over its dams located in other states, like the Mullaiperiyar dam in Kerala, has appeared to convince the Centre, which has agreed to hold the Dam Safety Bill in abeyance.</p>
      <p>Also, the Tamil Nadu government will continue to have full control on operation and maintenance of Mullaiperiyar dam and the Dam Safety Bill 2019 will not alter the existing arrangements. The Bill, approved by the Lok Sabha in the monsoon session, is pending in the Rajya Sabha and it provides for proper surveillance, inspection, operation and maintenance of all specified dams in the country to ensure their safe functioning. It provides for constitution of a National Committee on Dam Safety which will evolve dam safety policies and recommend necessary regulations as may be required for the purpose.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>On June 15, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting him to hold the Bill in abeyance till a consensus is reached between Tamil Nadu and other states. In his letter, he had reiterated that former Chief Minister of J. Jayalalithaa, during her term, had also conveyed the state’s objections to certain aspects of the Bill’s draft and those objections have not been considered.</p>
      <p>On June 26, the Tamil Nadu government followed up the letter by passing a resolution in the state legislative Assembly to vehemently oppose the Bill. Following this, the Union government has now assured TN that the Bill will not be taken up for discussion in the Parliament during this session and will be held in abeyance.</p>
      <p>On Monday Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat told a delegation of ministers and AIADMK MPs, led by fisheries minister D. Jayakumar, that the Bill would not alter the existing arrangement of dam ownership, its operation and maintenance, and the water rights of Tamil Nadu.     </p>
      <p>The Centre has been sensitive in modifying the provisions contained in the 2010 Bill because of the state’s genuine concern, and in the present Bill the State Dam Safety Organisation of Kerala will have no jurisdiction over the Mullaiperiyar dam or other reservoirs of Tamil Nadu, he said.</p>
      <p>This modification was evolved during a discussion with States in the 37th meeting of national committee on dam safety (NCDS) held in February 2017 at Roorkee to allay the concerns raised by Tamil Nadu representatives and this modification was found satisfactory by all parties concerned.</p>
      <p>Jayakumar and electricity minister P. Thangamani who called on Shekhawat and later Union home minister Amit Shah, reiterated Tamil Nadu’s opposition to the passing of the Bill. Shekhawat further said the newly provisioned role played by the national authority as State Dam Safety Organisation (SDSO) will facilitate TN government in taking care of long pending works, eventually meeting the requirement of raising reservoir level as envisaged by empowered committee. The minister told the delegation that he had on November 21 informed the Lok Sabha that Mullaiperiyar dam was safe as per Supreme Court’’s empowered committee.</p>
      <p>He had also requested Kerala to cooperate in providing electricity, an access road and other amenities to the Tamil Nadu government for day-to-day maintenance of the dam.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters later, Jayakumar said Tamil Nadu had requested  Shekhawat to exempt it from the provisions of Dam Safety Bill as there were five dams in the state having inter-state control and rights. The MPs, led by AIADMK’s A. Navaneethakrishnan also sought for increasing the level of water in Mullaiperiyar up to 152 feet instead of 136 feet.</p>
