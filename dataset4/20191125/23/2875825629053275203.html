      <h2>Caitlyn Jenner surprised Geordie duo Ant and Dec on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! by responding with a classic Newcastle saying that had the camp in tears</h2>

      <p>Caitlyn Jenner has certainly used her time in the Australian jungle to learn some new skills.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star has looked to embrace much of what's on offer with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> and that has included mimicking the accent of the show's presenters, Ant and Dec.</p>
      <p>The US reality star has already tried to get her mouth around saying "Yorkshire" but seemed to have better luck taking on a Geordie saying.</p>
      <p>The campmates were gathered for the arrival of Ant and Dec so that they could find out who will be doing the next Bushtucker Trial.</p>

      <p>As the Geordie presenting duo went around the campmates, letting them know whether they are up for the next trial, they were taken aback by Caitlyn's response.</p>
      <p>The Kardashians star responded to her name being called by saying back: "Howay, pet!"</p>
      <p>This brought much laughter to the group and viewers at home were loving her cheeky comeback, with some saying that she should be crowned Queen of the Jungle for that alone.</p>
      <p>One viewer tweeted: "Caitlyn Jenner saying 'haway pet' is absolute TV gold #ImACeleb"</p>
      <p>Another commented: "Lmao Caitlyn saying pet, she’s learning geordie"</p>
      <p>A third wrote: "Caitlyn Jenner saying ‘howay pet’ in the Geordie accent she did was adorable"</p>
      <p>While a fourth proclaimed: "caitlyn saying howay pet what a QUEEN"</p>

      <p>This followed Caitlyn sneaking some corn on the cob back into the camp for former Arsenal and England legend, Ian Wright.</p>
      <p>Ian, Corrie star Andy Whyment and former EastEnders actor Cliff Parisi, had all missed out on a roast dinner after the group hadn't managed to get enough stars in the previous day's Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>Ian has been on the verge of cracking in recent times as he finds the jungle life a little harder than her expected.</p>
      <p>Missing out on the feast had hit him hard but Caitlyn brought him a little cheer and fans of the ITV show are increasingly enjoying the reality star's involvement.</p>
