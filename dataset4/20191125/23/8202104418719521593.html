      <p>Fines <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/enough-is-enough-province-boosts-fines-for-distracted-drivers-in-saskatchewan">are set to rise in February with a first offence starting at $580</a>, plus four demerits, and repeat offences resulting in vehicle impoundments. The <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/mom-of-sask-teen-killed-in-distracted-driving-crash-becomes-new-operation-lifesavers-stop-track-tragedies-spokesperson/wcm/1fa860d4-ceba-4a22-8b37-9d16d33740a8">current fine is $280 and four</a> demerits.</p>
      <p>“Enough is enough,” Minister Responsible for SGI Joe Hargrave said in a statement this month when the new fines were announced.</p>
      <p>“Despite increased enforcement by police and significant awareness efforts by SGI, <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/you-dont-get-to-do-things-over-mom-who-lost-teen-daughter-in-suspected-distracted-driving-crash-calls-on-others-to-pay-attention-to-road">22 people lost their lives on Saskatchewan roads in 2018</a> due to distracted driving or inattention. <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/saskatchewan/sgi-reports-jump-in-road-fatalities-in-2018-distracted-driving-continues-to-be-a-problem/wcm/968df5a1-a11b-42d0-8cef-59a0f8c4bedc">That is 22 deaths</a> too many.”</p>
      <p>In 2018, distraction or inattention were factors in more than 6,000 collisions and 774 injuries, according to SGI. <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/saskatchewan/more-than-3000-charges-laid-during-road-safety-week">Between May and July this year</a>, more than 1,000 distracted driving tickets were issued across the province.</p>
      <p>Under The Traffic Safety Act, <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/1400-school-zone-speeding-tickets-nearly-800-distracted-driving-tickets-issued-in-sask-last-month-sgi">distracted driving tickets are issued to drivers convicted</a> of holding, viewing, using or manipulating a cell phone while driving a motor vehicle on a highway, or while driving a vehicle on a highway without due care and attention.</p>
      <p>“Distracted driving kills and injures people; it is a serious safety concern, and our government is sending a direct message to drivers,” Hargrave said.</p>
      <p>Other results in SGI’s traffic safety report include 324 impaired driving offences (283 of which led to Criminal Code charges), 6,583 speeding or aggressive driving offences, and 387 tickets for improper seatbelt or child restraint use.</p>
