      <h2>Amelia Ronaldson has fallen ill following a year of living in the mould infested Cornwall Council provided flat without a proper hot water source she lives in in Camborne</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:05:17+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:05</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, Chris Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>A single mum has become severely depressed and anxious following a year-and-a-half of living in a mould infested flat with no hot water or heating.</p>
      <p>Amelia Ronaldson has had to send her three-year-old boy to live with his dad due to the condition in the Cornwall Council provided flat she lives in in Camborne.</p>
      <p>When the 22-year-old moved into the property in May last year she was informed by a housing officer that there was some damp and repairs that needed doing.</p>
      <p>Things quickly began to unravel.</p>
      <p>“Once in I realised I had no hot water and the heating wasn’t working, so I messaged him on several occasions asking for a number to call and he said he’d put the request in again," Amelia said.</p>
      <p>“I had several flat inspections with the same officer who kept saying he’d put the requests in for repairs and I made him aware that I still, after six months, had no hot water or heating and the damp was getting worse despite using dehumidifiers and black mould remover.</p>

      <p>“Months went past again whilst I was still messaging the number I’d been given by my housing officer to contact him about things that needed doing."</p>
      <p>Amelia decided to go to the council's offices accompanied with her mum to try and get the issues resolved.</p>
      <p>“I was informed that my new housing officer was signed off long term sick and my old housing officer had passed away," she said.</p>

      <p>"I showed the move on officer and someone else who I’d never met before the pictures of my flat and told them the conditions, i.e. no hot water and heating, and that by this point some of my electrics had started leaking water.”</p>
      <p>While looking for the source of the leak Amelia discovered that the portable appliance test for all of her electrics went out last year, she claimed</p>
      <p>Although she is able to wash in the warmth of her electric shower, baths and washing up require her to boil water.</p>

      <p>Amelia said that a move-on officer came round to the property and was shocked by its state, assuring her he would arrange a meeting with the landlord, new housing officer and repairs team.</p>
      <p>Five months on and, despite a flat inspection and numerous assurances, nothing has changed.</p>
      <p>Amelia added: “I had a flat inspection two weeks ago on Monday where I showed the move-on officer and new housing officer the conditions, they took pictures and said it’s disgusting.</p>

      <p>“They said they’d put an urgent repairs notice through to get me hot water and heating but that was two weeks ago on Monday and still nothing.</p>
      <p>“I’ve also got a doctor’s letter stating that my asthma diagnosis was only after I moved into the flat and he believes it’s the conditions I’m living in is the reason I’m having so many asthma attacks and having to call paramedics or go to Barncoose Hospital most weeks.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got a three-year-old little boy who has had to go and live with his dad, making my mental health worse, resulting in me being signed off sick due to severe anxiety and chronic depression, along with a personality disorder.”</p>
      <p>Cornwall Council has been contacted for commment.</p>
