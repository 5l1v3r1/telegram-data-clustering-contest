      <h1>Apple Watch is even saving the lives of doctors now by alerting them to heart conditions</h1>

      <p>At this point, there’s no shortage of Apple Watch users who credit this impressive piece of wearable tech with saving their life by alerting them to a potential heart condition. The watch can, of course, do a whole lot more, from alerting you to emails, playing music, and other mundane tasks, but each time one of these users steps forward to credit the device with catching a serious heart condition early, it offers a reminder of how meaningful a product the watch is — and that it’s not just another expensive gadget to shoehorn into your life.</p>
      <p>In one of the latest cases, the user in question was someone you’d assume wouldn’t need a helpful nudge. He’s Dr. Ray Emerson, a 79-year-old Texas veterinarian who said he recently got a notification from the watch, which caused him to look down and notice that “[it] said you are in atrial fibrillation [AFib for short].”</p>
      <p>That’s a potentially serious condition in which the heart’s upper chambers aren’t in sync with the lower chambers. Emerson told <a href="https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/smartwatch-detects-heart-problem-before-central-texas-man-notices-symptoms"><i>CBS Austin</i></a> that the watch “told me I wasn’t feeling as good as I thought I was.” He made a bee-line for his doctor, who confirmed the news. “Ray,” he recounted, “your watch is right. You are in atrial fibrillation.”</p>
      <p>Emerson then underwent surgery. According to Dr. Jason Zagrodsky of Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute at St. David’s Medical Center, at least a couple of times a week someone comes in purely on the basis of their Apple Watch alerting them to a problem. Most people, he told the Austin station, don’t know there’s something wrong with them up to that point.</p>
      <p>Emerson would have remained in that latter category, but for a lucky bit of happenstance: He laments that he’d been “too cheap” to buy the watch for himself, but luckily someone gave it to him as a gift. A person might have a handful of AFib episodes during the course of the day, but Zagrodsky said the watch’s value is that it doesn’t need be perfect: “It only needs to detect one of those to make the diagnosis.”</p>
