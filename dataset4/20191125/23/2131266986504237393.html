      <p>An Australian Senator has been awarded NZ$126,711 after suing a former member of the senate for calling her a misandrist, another word for a man-hater.</p>
      <p>Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, told the press the victory was for women who had been 'made to stay silent'.</p>
      <p>Hanson-Young, fo the Green Party, filed the defamation lawsuit against David Leyonhjelm in 2018 after he reportedly yelled at her to 'stop shagging men' during a discussion about relaxing importation restrictions on pepper spray for women.</p>

      </p>
      <p>She alleged Leyonhjelm defamed her by refusing to issue an apology and continued to give interviews claiming the Greens senator believed all men are rapists.</p>
      <p>Leyonhjelm told local media in 2018, he did not agree with Senator Hanson-Young's sentiments about all men being rapists, he believed he had the right to voice his opinion.</p>
      <p>However, on Monday federal court judge, justice Richard White ruled against Leyonhjelm. </p>
      <p>Hanson-Young gave a tearful statement to the media on Monday.</p>
      <p>"I'm glad it's over, this is a really important decision, what the judge has found is that Mr Leyonhjelm was motivated by malice.</p>
      <p>That he wanted to publicly shame me," she said in a statement.</p>
      <p>She told The Project Australia, she wants to make sure every woman and girl knows, you have a right to be treated with respect.</p>
      <p>Hanson-Young said the damages would be donated to two women's charities,  Plan International Working Women's Centre and the South Australian Working Women’s Centre. </p>
      <p>The pair are set to return to court on December 17.</p>
