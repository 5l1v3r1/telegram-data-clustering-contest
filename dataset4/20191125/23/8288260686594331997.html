      <p>Dominic Raab has been called a "coward" by the friends and family of Harry Dunn, who were hoping to confront him at a hustings in his constituency.</p>
      <p>Tim Dunn, Harry's father, was unable to enter the event held in the Esher and Walton constituency due to overcrowding, which led to him and other supporters heckling the Foreign Secretary outside.</p>
      <p>A crowd booed and branded Mr Raab a "coward" as he left East Molesey Methodist Church in an official car on Monday evening, after the event where he and other candidates aimed to appeal to local constituents.</p>
      <p>Mr Dunn, whose son died almost three months ago, and Harry's mother Charlotte Charles have previously been critical of the Tory candidate.</p>
      <p>Harry was killed when his motorbike was involved in a head-on crash with a car outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on August 27.</p>

      <p>Anne Sacoolas, the motorist allegedly responsible for the crash, claimed diplomatic immunity and was allowed to return to the US, sparking an international controversy.</p>
      <p>Harry's family hoped to put pressure on the Foreign Secretary at the hustings in Surrey, but they and other supporters were kept outside of the packed venue, which saw many attendees without a seat.</p>
      <p>A member of staff at the church said the decision was related to fire safety.</p>
      <p>Following questions on the NHS, Brexit and foreign policy, a local resident stood up to address Mr Raab during his closing statement.</p>
      <p>Rebecca Little, who lives in Cobham, told the PA news agency that she has been following the events on social media.</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old said she chose to ask Mr Raab about the case on behalf of Harry's family, claiming that they were prevented from entering the event by his security.</p>
      <p>"I was shut down by the shouting when I stood up but I could see other people in the audience saying, 'Come on, let them in'," she said.</p>
      <p>"There were several security detail preventing the family from coming in but they have a right to enter the hustings.</p>
      <p>"When Raab's heavies are preventing them coming in, I believe the people in there had a right to know."</p>
