      <h2>Over seven lakh people are deciding the fate of 18 candidates in the three constituencies.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:55:40+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>Polling remained by and large peaceful with 75.34 per cent average voting till 5 pm in Kharagpur Sadar, Karimpur and Kaliaganj Assembly seats that went to bypolls on Monday.</p>
      <p>Over seven lakh people are deciding the fate of 18 candidates in the three constituencies.</p>
      <p>In Kharagpur Sadar, 67.62 per cent of 2.25 lakh voters cast their votes till 5 pm, an official said. Kaliaganj with 2.69 lakh electorate, and Karimpur with 2.4 lakh electorate recorded 77.17 and 81.23 per cent votes, respectively, the official added.</p>
      <p>Two of the three Assembly constituencies — Kharagpur Sadar and Karimpur — fell vacant after the Lok Sabha elections in May this year as the sitting MLAs were elected as MPs.</p>
      <p>Bypolls were necessitated in Kaliaganj in North Dinajpur district following the death of sitting Congress MLA Parmathanath Roy.</p>
      <p>The bypolls will be a litmus test for the TMC and the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a>, ahead of the 2021 state elections. The results will be declared on November 28.</p>
