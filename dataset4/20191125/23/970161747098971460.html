      <p>Rachel Riley, who sparked criticism last week after wearing a t-shirt showing an edited picture of Jeremy Corbyn, put any backlash to one side as she stepped out with husband Pasha Kovalev tonight.</p>
      <p>The pregnant Countdown star attended the White Christmas press night in London, along with the likes of Nicola Roberts and some of ITV’s Loose Women.</p>
      <p>Rachel caused a social media storm last week over her choice of attire in a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/rachel-riley-hit-calls-sacked-jeremy-corbyn-t-shirt-backlash-continues-11197449/">political Twitter post</a>.</p>
      <p>Writing on the night of ITV’s political debate between Jeremy Corbyn and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a>, Rachel said: ‘I didn’t feel comfortable knowing my workplace was to be full of racists tonight.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t endorse Boris, but I do endorse #NeverCorbyn. Please see my pinned thread if you still don’t understand why.’</p>
      <p>In an accompanying photo of herself, she wore a t-shirt showing an image of Corbyn holding a placard reading ‘Jeremy Corbyn is a racist endeavor’.</p>

      <p>Rachel and Pasha, who met on Strictly Come Dancing in 2013, are expecting their first child in December.</p>
      <p>They revealed Rachel was pregnant in May 2019 and married two months later in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>The White Christmas event was to celebrate a special performance of the festive production, based on the 1954 film of the same name.</p>

      <p>It’s currently showing at the Dominion Theatre in the West End, and is booking until the 4 January.</p>
      <p>Girls Aloud star Nicola Roberts was also at the event.</p>
      <p>It comes after she, along with former band mates Kimberley Walsh and Cheryl Cole, were last week forced to deny they had a Whatsapp group against I’m a Celeb’s Nadine Coyle.</p>

      <p>The trio said in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/cheryl-denies-voting-for-voting-girls-aloud-bandmate-nadine-coyle-to-do-im-a-celebrity-trials-11205070/">a statement</a>: ‘We don’t have a group chat about I’m A Celebrity.</p>
      <p>‘This just isn’t true. We only wish Nadine the best in the jungle and hope she does well on the show.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, representing Loose Women were Coleen Nolan, Andrea McLean, Gloria Hunniford and Linda Robson.</p>
      <p>It seems party season is officially upon us.</p>
