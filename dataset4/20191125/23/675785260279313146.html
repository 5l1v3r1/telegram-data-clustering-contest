      <p>A trailer for the new series revealed that the Time Lord, played by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jodie-whittaker">Jodie Whittaker</a> , is chased on a motorbike by Sir Lenny Henry who appears to be a gun-toting baddie.</p>
      <p>And along the way it looks like the Cybermen are making a comeback.</p>
      <p>Boss Chris Chibnall said: “It’s the biggest episode we’ve ever done.”</p>

      <p>The BBC's newly released trailer hints at the Time Lord's dark past as well as some returning big bads.</p>
      <p>While much of the trailer focuses on the fun tone, bizarre locations and mysterious monsters fans have come to expect from this incarnation, something much bigger and much badder is hinted at.</p>
      <p>"Something's coming for me," the Doctor announces, "I can feel it."</p>
      <p>"Let it come!" declares Tosin Cole's Ryan Sinclair as the camera cuts to an old foe - a Cyberman.</p>
      <p>"Cos we're your mates," says Mandip Gill's Yasmin Khan.</p>

      <p>There are also some famous faces about, including actor and comedian Stephen Fry.</p>
      <p>We also get a peak at the returning giant rhino aliens, the Judoon, as well as the hissing spider-like creatures, the Racnoss.</p>
      <p>The trailer closes by telling us we can expect it in early 2020 - a relief for fans considering the show'll be skipping out on the usual Christmas special this year.</p>

      <p>The highly-anticipated 12th series is due to start on New Year’s Day, with one of the biggest episodes in the show’s history.</p>
      <p>Whittaker and her time-travelling pals Bradley Walsh as Graham O’Brien, Tosin Cole as his step grandson Ryan Sinclair and Mandip Gill as Yasmin Khan, will all return for the new 10-part run.</p>
      <p>The second half of the story is then expected to air on January 4, as the series shifts back to its traditional Saturday evening teatime slot.</p>
