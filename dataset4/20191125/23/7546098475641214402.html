      <h1>3 ASX 200 events you missed on Monday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:05:57+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/kennethhallau/" target="_blank">Kenneth Hall</a></address>
      <p>It was another huge start to the trading week as the <b>S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/latest-asx-200-chart-price-news/">(INDEXASX: XJO)</a> surged higher on Monday.</p>
      <p>The Aussie benchmark index added 21.60 (0.32%) to close at 6.731.40 points.</p>
      <p>Here’s what you might have missed in a great start to the week for ASX investors.</p>
      <h3>1. Afterpay leads ASX 200 winners on Monday</h3>
      <p>The <b>Afterpay Touch Group Ltd </b>(ASX: APT) share price was a top performer on the ASX 200 on Monday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/25/afterpay-share-price-storms-higher-on-austrac-audit-update/">Afterpay shares rocketed 7.05% higher to $32.64,</a> after a favourable update on its AUSTRAC audit.</p>
      <p>The company’s final report from its external auditor has now been provided to AUSTRAC. There was one key item in the report that sent the Afterpay share price higher yesterday.</p>
      <p>The auditor found that “the actual money laundering and terrorism financing risks inherently faced by Afterpay’s business are low.” This was enough of a positive sentiment to boost investors’ hopes (and the Afterpay share price) higher.</p>
      <h3>2. Nufarm share price tanks on earnings downgrade</h3>
      <p>The <b>Nufarm Limited </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Nufarm+Limited/?ticker=ASX-NUF">(ASX: NUF)</a> share price crashed out on Monday to lead the ASX 200 losers.</p>
      <p>Nufarm’s share price crashed 17.53% lower and closed at $5.08 per share.</p>
      <p>The big factor was <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/25/why-the-nufarm-share-price-has-plummeted-18-today/">Nufarm’s earnings downgrade,</a> which forecast significantly lower earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).</p>
      <p>The Aussie agriculture group reported difficult trading conditions for FY20 which saw first quarter EBITDA fall $20 million compared to last year.</p>
      <h3>3. Westpac can’t escape the money laundering music</h3>
      <p>The headaches continued for <b>Westpac Banking Corp </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Westpac+Banking+Corp/?ticker=ASX-WBC">(ASX: WBC)</a> on the ASX 200 on Monday.</p>
      <p>ASIC became the latest regulator involved in the scandal as it investigates the bank over potential legal breaches.</p>
      <p>This follows Treasurer Frydenberg’s confirmation that APRA would be looking into the bank following its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing failures.</p>
      <p>The Westpac share price closed down 1.33% at $24.44 per share in another bad day for shareholders.</p>
