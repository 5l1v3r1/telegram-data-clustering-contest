      <h1>U.K. Chief Rabbi Suggests Voters Should Avoid Corbyn’s Labour</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:29:35+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/" target="_blank">Alex Morales</a></address>
      <p>(Bloomberg) -- Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis attacked Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party, suggesting voters should avoid casting a ballot for the main opposition in the U.K.’s Dec. 12 general election because of antisemitism “sanctioned from the top.”</p>
      <p>Mirvis wrote in the Times newspaper that British Jews are increasingly concerned about the prospect of a Labour government. He criticized the party for hounding out lawmakers and other party staffers for challenging antisemitism, and said it’s a “mendacious fiction” that the party has investigated every single case of anti-Jewish racism.</p>
      <p>“A new poison -- sanctioned from the top -- has taken root in the Labour Party,” Mirvis wrote. “It can no longer claim to be the party of equality and anti-racism.”</p>
      <p>Labour issued a statement saying Corbyn is a “lifelong campaigner against antisemitism and has made absolutely clear it has no place in our party and society.”</p>
      <p>Under Corbyn, the party has been hit by a series of antisemitism scandals, and the leader himself has come under scrutiny for his history of sharing speaking platforms with supporters of Hamas and Hezbollah. The problem has sparked a formal probe by the U.K.’s Equality and Human Rights Commission to determine if Labour has unlawfully discriminated against Jews, which is yet to report.</p>
      <p>While Mirvis didn’t explicitly tell British citizens not to vote for Labour, he said: “I simply pose the question: What will the result of this election say about the moral compass of our country? When December 12 arrives, I ask every person to vote with their conscience. Be in no doubt, the very soul of our nation is at stake.”</p>
