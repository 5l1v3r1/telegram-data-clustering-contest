      <h1>CBC/Netflix show ‘Anne with an E’ cancelled after three seasons</h1>
      <h2>This likely has to do with the CBC severing ties with Netflix in October</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:46:13+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/brad-bennett" target="_blank">Brad Bennett</a></address>
      <p>The CBC and Netflix co-production<i> Anne with an E </i>has been cancelled after three seasons.</p>
      <p>The show, <a href="https://www.academy.ca/2019/broadcast-gala-winners/">which won seven awards at the Canadian Screen Awards</a> earlier this year, has run its course after the conclusion of its third season.</p>
      <p>The news comes from the Instagram account of the show’s Canadian creator Moira Walley-Beckett, but it was foreshadowed in early October when the CBC cut ties with Netflix.</p>
      <p>Walley-Beckett made a name for herself writing and producing <i>Breaking Bad </i>before she began adapting Lucy Maud Montgomery’s classic Canadian series Anne of Green Gable for modern audiences.</p>

      <p>The Netflix/CBC show took a gritter look at life on Prince Edward Island in the late 19th century while also offering stunning scenes that showcased Canada in a high-quality way. Personally, I was a huge fan of the show and will be joining many other Canadians on Twitter with #Renew Anne with an E and #Renew AWAE.</p>
      <p>You can watch all three seasons of the show on the CBC Gem app right now, or wait until they hit Netflix on January 3rd.</p>
      <p>This is one of a few shows that Netflix was co-producing with the Candian broadcaster, it’s also one of the most popular in Canada since it won so many Screen Awards. Since it’s being cancelled it doesn’t leave a lot of hope for the remaining shows, like <i>Northern Rescue </i>and <i>Alias Grace. </i></p>
      <p>In regards to CBC backing out if its deal with Netflix, the broadcaster’s CEO Cathrine Tait told the <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9jb250ZW50Y2FuYWRhLm5ldC9mZWVkLz9wb3N0X3R5cGU9cG9kY2FzdA%3D%3D&amp;episode=aHR0cHM6Ly9jb250ZW50Y2FuYWRhLm5ldC8_cG9zdF90eXBlPXBvZGNhc3QmcD01MjQ4&amp;hl=en-CA"><i>Content Canada </i>podcast</a> that she saw the deal with the streaming service as more of a way to bolster Netflix instead of creating more opportunities and growing the Canadian media industry.</p>
      <p>As noted by the <i><a href="https://business.financialpost.com/telecom/media/cbc-will-no-longer-work-with-netflix-to-produce-shows-says-catherine-tait">Financial Post</a>, </i>this is a large change of view from when Tait told media that the cost-saving partnership was the future of the CBC.</p>
