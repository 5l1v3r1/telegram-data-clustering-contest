        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lewis-hamilton/">Lewis Hamilton</a> and Raheem Sterling lead this list year’s BBC Sports Personality of the Year nominees following a tremendous year of achievements.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Formula One racer Lewis was among the six shortlisted names announced on Monday after a stellar year, which saw him win his sixth world title, placing him just one title behind the legendary Michael Schumacher.</p>
      <p>It could be the second time Lewis wins the coveted award after scooping the honour for the first time back in 2014.</p>
      <p>Raheem, 24, has been nominated for his work with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a>, who claimed a treble this year winning the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fa-cup/">FA Cup</a> and the Carabao Cup. In personal news, the footballer secretly became a father for the third time with his girlfriend, Paige Milian, sharing the happy news of their 11-month-old son Thai-Cruz’s arrival last week.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere on the nominations list, athletics star Katarina Johnson Thompson was recognised after winning gold in the heptathlon at the World Championships in Doha where she set the British record.</p>

      <p>Popstar Ed Sheeran earlier announced cricketer Ben Stokes as a shortlisted name while rapper Stormzy did the honours of revealing Dina Asher Smith as another nominee. Welsh rugby player Alun Wyn Jones is also up for the prestigious award.</p>
      <p>It comes hours after Lewis, 34, spoke about the positive impact he wanted to have on the younger generation, following in the footsteps of his hero Ayrton Senna.</p>

      <p>‘I am trying to have a positive impact,’ Lewis told reporters in Monaco according to PA Media.</p>
      <p>‘I looked at Ayrton Senna. He was a star in the sky and I want to somehow get up there.</p>
      <p>‘It is important to find people like that and that is what I am trying to be.</p>
      <p>‘If you look at young kids they are pure spirits. We are not born to hate or have negativity in our hearts.</p>
      <p>‘That is something we learn over time. It is passed to us by our parents, and whatever issues they have going on, and through people you interact with.</p>

      <p>‘It is always really important to stay true to your core values, and I am really fortunate that I have this amazing platform, that I never thought I would have. I am trying to be the best person I can.’</p>
