      <p><b>Hyderabad: </b>In yet another case of drunk driving in the IT corridor area of Cyberabad, a businessman under the influence of alcohol drove his BMW in the wrong direction and rammed the car into a bike killing a techie and injuring his friend on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>The injured pillion rider was admitted to a private hospital and her condition is stated to be critical, said Madhapur police who booked a case against the businessman and took him into custody.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Abhishek Anand, 28, an employee of Pega Systems at Madhapur was a resident of Anand Nagar Colony in Kondapur. He hailed from Nirzahant village in Bhagalpur district of Bihar. Abhishek, an engineering graduate, has been working in the city for the last four years. About four months ago, he joined Pega Systems. He was living along with his parents and a brother.</p>
      <p>On Sunday night, Abhishek along with his friend, Lisa Dhar Choudhury, went for dinner to Madhapur and was returning to Kondapur on a bike (TS 07 EZ 5891). At around 11.30 pm, when the duo reached Khanamet Crossroads and were travelling towards the Kondapur side, a BMW (AP 10 AX 6267) driven by Kondaveeti Ashwin, 35, which was moving in the wrong direction, rammed into the bike.</p>
      <p>The accused Ashwin runs Sri Sai Interiors, a business, and owns the BMW.</p>
      <p>“The duo on the bike fell on the median and the car dragged them for some distance. Abhishek died on the spot with multiple injuries while the pillion rider, Lisa, suffered severe injuries. She is admitted to a private hospital for treatment and is currently in the Intensive Care Unit," said Madhapur inspector, S. Venkat Reddy.</p>
      <p>He went to Novotel hotel and consumed alcohol there. He was driving in a drunk condition and moved his vehicle onto the wrong side of the road and ended up killing the techie, said the inspector. “When tested with the breath analyser, the blood alcohol content of the accused was recorded as 185 mg. However, his blood samples have been collected and sent for forensic analysis. He was taken into custody and a case has been registered based on a complaint from Abhinav Anand, the brother of the deceased,” said inspector Reddy.</p>
      <p>Abhishek's body was shifted to Osmania General Hospital mortuary and handed over to his family after the post-mortem examination on Monday.</p>
      <p>It may be recalled that on November 11, P. Abhilash, 28, a techie working with Cognizant drove his car in a drunk condition and hit two persons who were standing on the Biodiversity flyover under Raidurgam in the IT corridor area of Cyberabad. The duo was thrown on the ground and death was instant for them.</p>
