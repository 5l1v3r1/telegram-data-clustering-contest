      <p><b>BMW</b> is believed to be the first car company in Australia to <b>buy back</b> a batch of used cars affected by a recall of <b>potentially deadly Takata airbags</b>.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bmw/">BMW</a> and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) issued a warning pleading with owners of 12,663 BMWs to <b><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/806389/bmw-takata-fatality/">stop driving their cars immediately</a></b> following a fatality and a serious injury crash suspected of being linked to a new type of Takata airbag not previously recalled.</p>
      <p>Other fatalities and serious injuries had also been reported overseas on <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bmw/3series/">BMW 3 Series</a> models made from <b>November 1997 to June 2000</b>. In Australia the case involving the fatality is still before the coroner.</p>
      <p>When the warning was issued, BMW and the ACCC said remedies included providing a loan vehicle, a rental car, paying for taxis or <b>buying back affected models</b>.</p>
      <p>BMW Australia would not disclose exactly how many cars have been bought back since the recall was published two-and-a-half weeks ago.</p>
      <p>However the boss of BMW Australia, Vikram Pawah, confirmed the buybacks have started.</p>

      <p>“Yes we have, we have already bought a few,” he said when asked by <i>CarAdvice</i> how many vehicles have been bought back so far. “I can’t give you number right now … we are working with each and every individual right now.”</p>
      <p>He added: “The numbers are still coming in… we’re in the process of connecting customers and providing them with a solution to get them mobile at the moment”.</p>
      <p>The BMW boss insisted dealers are were not getting overwhelmed with long queues of concerned customers scrambling for a loan car, and that the process has so far been orderly.</p>
      <p>When asked if the bought back BMWs will be crushed – or eventually fixed and resold – the BMW Australia boss said: “We will make those decisions as we go along, nothing to share at this point.”</p>
      <p>BMW and the ACCC took the drastic action to have owners <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/806389/bmw-takata-fatality/">stop driving affected cars immediately</a> because this type of Takata airbag – in 12,663 vehicles – had not previously been caught up in the recall affecting 3.8 million airbags in Australia and more than 100 million worldwide.</p>
      <p>BMW models in this age range were recently involved in two separate crashes, one a fatality and one a serious injury. These two incidents brought the total number of fatalities related to Takata airbags in Australia to two and the number of serious injuries to two.</p>
      <p>However, authorities believe there may have been more deaths or serious injuries related to faulty Takata airbags – which can spray shrapnel when deployed in a crash – that may have been unreported.</p>

      <p>One example yet to be formally linked to the Takata recall is a crash in Canberra in 2014, uncovered by <i><a href="https://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/exclusive--accc--bmw-investigate-takata-injury-claim-117648">The Sydney Morning Herald</a> l</i>ast year.</p>
      <p>The male passenger of a 2005-model <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bmw/">BMW</a> suffered severe lacerations to his face after the airbag was deployed in a crash.</p>
      <p>The owner of the BMW received a recall notice months later, but before the Takata safety campaign received global recognition.</p>
      <p>BMW owners who are unsure of whether they are affected by this recall can check their vehicle’s identifying numbers (VIN) by checking <b><a href="http://www.recall.bmw.com.au/">www.recall.bmw.com.au</a></b>.</p>
