      <h2>Manchester City stars dominated the Premier League Team of the Decade, with inclusions from Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:15:53+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:15</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher both named their Premier League Team of the Decade.</p>
      <p>This season will see the Premier League go into 2020, bringing an end to another fascinating decade for the top-flight.</p>
      <p>There have been titles for both Manchester clubs, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and of course <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City, who stunned the football world in 2015.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the turn of the decade, Sky Sports pundits Neville and Carragher both selected their respective teams.</p>
      <p>While there were positions they disagreed on, the pair did both select the same goalkeeper and defence.</p>

      <p>Both Carragher and Neville selected David de Gea as their goalkeeper.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> pair Pablo Zabaleta and Vincent Komapny were selected in defence, alongside Chelsea skipper Cesar Azpilicueta and Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk.</p>
      <p>On the Dutchman, Carragher said: "When he finishes at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , I think he will be No.1. I always said John Terry but I think he will be even better."</p>

      <p>Both of the Sky pundits selected City legends David Silva and Yaya Toure in midfield, with Carragher going for N'Golo Kante and Neville selecting Eden Hazard in a deeper role.</p>
      <p>In attack, both went with Sergio Aguero with Neville partnering him with Harry Kane and Luis Suarez.</p>
      <p>Carragher instead had Hazard in attack, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> star Gareth Bale.</p>

      <p>The Liverpool legend wasn't particularly impressed with his fellow pundit's selection, adding: "He has got three players who want to be in the same position.</p>
      <p>"This is why England never won anything when he was a player or coach. Don't try and just get the best players in!"</p>
