      <p>SAN FRANCISCO -- Tesla's CEO Elon Musk says at least 200,000 people want the new Cybertruck after unveiling it on Thursday at the company's design studio in Southern California.</p>
      <p>Tesla's new futuristic-looking pickup truck was inspired by James Bond's car and fighter jets and does not look like any other heavy pickup in the market.</p>

      <p>During the unveiling, Tesla demonstrated the truck's durability by throwing metal balls at the truck.</p>
      <p>To Musk's surprise, the balls left cracks on the window but did not penetrate through to the interior.</p>
