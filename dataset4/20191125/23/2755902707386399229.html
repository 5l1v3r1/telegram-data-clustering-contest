        <b>Elon Musk ridiculed over Cybertruck, explains why windows cracked</b>
      </p>
      <p>Elon Musk, the multi-billionaire business extraordinaire known for his uninhibited traits and savvy in technology and interest in Space travel is no stranger to being in the news. The Pretoria born businessman, who holds citizenship in three countries, South Africa, Canada and United States of America, was in the news over the weekend after he launched his latest invention, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Cybertruck">the cyber truck</a>.</p>

      <p>As per any other reveal, people are always in awe of the various features of the new product. Things did not go down well for Elon, who was presenting the cyber truck himself after he tried to test out the anti smash feature on the window of the beastly truck as the window cracked, which was not supposed to happen.</p>
      <p>After The botched Presentation, Musk took to Twitter to set the record straight.</p>
      <aside>Yup. Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn’t bounce off. Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door. Next time …</aside>
      <p>Despite the “minor” glitch as Elon tried to rub off the failed display, the internet seemed not to take kindly to the appearance of the truck with some suggesting that Elon was high when he designed /approved the truck design. Some even suggested it would cast well and win the role of Shrek the ogre.</p>
