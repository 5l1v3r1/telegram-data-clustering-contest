      <p>Elon Musk may be one of the richest people in America, but he’s slightly less rich than he was before he unveiled Tesla’s new Cybertruck on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-everything-that-happened-when-elon-musk-unveiled-the-cybertruck-2019-11">demonstration turned debacle</a>, Musk had Tesla’s lead designer, Franz von Holzhausen, test the strength of the vehicle’s “ultra-hard” stainless steel body and “armored glass” with first a sledgehammer and then a metal ball. When the truck’s window shattered on impact, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-everything-that-happened-when-elon-musk-unveiled-the-cybertruck-2019-11">Musk said “oh my f—ing god.”</a></p>
      <p>Investors had a similar reaction, and shares of the automaker sunk 6%, sending Musk’s net worth down $768 million in a single day, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hayleycuccinello/2019/11/22/elon-musk-net-worth-cybertruck/#13d2c3b373aa">Forbes’ Hayley Cuccinello</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Despite a massive net worth currently hovering <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/#5c85af2b7999">around $23.6 billion</a>, Musk has never taken a paycheck from Tesla, refusing his $56,000 minimum salary every year. In January, Tesla announced it would <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/01/23/tesla-elon-musk-targets-valuation-compensation/">pay Musk nothing</a> for the next 10 years – no salary, bonuses, or stock – until the company reaches a $100 billion market cap. If and when that happens, <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/01/23/tesla-elon-musk-worth-world-richest/">Musk could potentially</a> overtake Amazon CEO <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-net-worth-2017-10">Jeff Bezos</a> as the richest person in the world.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-dangers-of-overwork-2018-8">notorious workaholic</a>, Musk doesn’t spend his money on lavish vacations or expensive hobbies. Instead, the entrepreneur spends most of his free time at the office or in factories, retreating to one of several Los Angeles mansions he owns at the end of the day.</p>

I really believe that one should lead from the front lines, and that’s why I’m here.”</h3>
