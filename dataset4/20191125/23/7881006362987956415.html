      <p><b>Mumbai: </b>Even before the Supreme Court gives its decision on the political crisis in the state, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis took charge of his office in Mantralaya on Monday. On the very first day, he sanctioned Rs 5,380 crore from the state contingency fund to provide relief to farmers affected by unseasonal rains.</p>
      <p>While Mr Fadnavis was sworn in chief minister on Saturday morning, he officially took charge of his office on Monday.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The decision to sanction Rs 5,380 crore for rain-affected farmers came in the wake of a meeting between Mr Fadnavis and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Sunday evening.
