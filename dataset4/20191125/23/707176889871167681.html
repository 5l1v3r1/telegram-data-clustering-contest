      <h1>Corbyn not dealing with anti-Semitism, says chief rabbi</h1>
      <h2>Labour leader accused of allowing ‘a new poison’ to run through party</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:00:26+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author">George Parker</a></address>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn’s fitness for high office was on Monday night called into question by the chief rabbi, in a scathing attack in which he accused the Labour leader of allowing “a new poison” to run through his party.</p>
      <p>Ephraim Mirvis said the “very soul of our nation is at stake” in next month’s election, in one of the most hard-hitting interventions by a religious leader in British politics in recent times.</p>
      <p>The chief rabbi said his decision to speak out was “amongst the most painful moments” of his career, but warned that “a new poison” had <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/33fa5410-a32a-11e9-974c-ad1c6ab5efd1">taken hold in Labour</a> “sanctioned from the very top”.</p>
      <p>In an <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ephraim-mirvis-what-will-become-of-jews-in-britain-if-labour-forms-the-next-government-ghpsdbljk">article for The Times</a>, he says that the Labour leader’s claim to have dealt with all allegations of anti-Semitism was “a mendacious fiction” and the way that the party has handled the claims is “incompatible with the British values of which we are so proud”.</p>
      <p>He said that Labour could no longer claim to be the party of diversity, equality and antiracism. Its record on anti-Semitism in opposition, he says, left him asking: “What should we expect of them in government?”</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn has repeatedly insisted that he is getting to grips with anti-Semitism in his party and that he will not tolerate it, but a number of Labour MPs, including Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman, have quit the party in despair at the way the leadership had responded to the problem.</p>
      <p>Rabbi Mirvis said that British Jews were understandably anxious as they prepared to vote: “How complicit in prejudice would a leader of Her Majesty’s opposition have to be to be considered unfit for office?” he asked.</p>
      <p>“Would associations with those who have incited hatred against Jews be enough? Would describing as ‘friends’ those who endorse the murder of Jews be enough? It seems not.</p>

      <p>“It is not my place to tell any person how they should vote. I regret being in this situation at all. I simply pose the question: What will the result of this election say about the moral compass of our country? When December 12 arrives, I ask every person to vote with their conscience. Be in no doubt, the very soul of our nation is at stake.”</p>
      <p>A Labour spokeswoman said: “Jeremy Corbyn is a life-long campaigner against anti-Semitism and has made absolutely clear it has no place in our party and society and that no one who engages in it does so in his name.</p>
      <p>“A Labour government will guarantee the security of the Jewish community, defend and support the Jewish way of life, and combat rising anti-Semitism in our country and across Europe. Our race and faith manifesto, launched today, sets out our policies to achieve this.”</p>
      <p>Rabbi Julia Neuberger, echoed Rabbi Mirvis’s views of Mr Corbyn and anti-Semitism. “The Labour party under his leadership, [is] coloured by not dealing with it,” she told the BBC Today programme on Tuesday. “If they come to power then this comfortable place to live may feel less comfortable. What I think is critical is that people will feel increasingly uncomfortable and will look for ways of either moving or having a place somewhere else or whatever they can possibly do to mitigate what feels oppressive, uncomfortable, dangerous.”</p>
      <p>Labour peer Alf Dubs told the same programme that Labour should have moved faster to deal with allegations of anti-Semitism against some of its members.</p>
      <p>“I think he is fit to be prime minister, I do not believe he’s anti-Semitic, I believe things have happened under his leadership which should have been stopped way back,” said the 86-year-old pro-refugee campaigner.</p>
      <p>Lord Dubs said the party had moved on from its “murky” past and was progressing in a positive way. “Some of that is a long time ago and he has apologised since.</p>
      <p>“I certainly listen to what the Jewish community has to say and I’m sure Jeremy Corbyn does as well,” he said.</p>
      <p>Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, tweeted on Tuesday that Rabbi Mirvis’s “unprecedented statement at this time ought to alert us to the deep sense of insecurity and fear felt by many British Jews”.</p>
      <p>“Everyone in our country is entitled to feel safe and secure,” he added. “Voicing words that commit to a stand against anti-Semitism requires a corresponding effort in visible action.”</p>
      <p>Archbishop Welby called on parties to “make it an absolute priority to offer positive reassurance and avoid anything that increases the perception of fear”.</p>
