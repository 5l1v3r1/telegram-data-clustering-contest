        <b>Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) might have been left for dead in Hollyoaks several weeks back, but her nightmares are far from over just yet — quite literally — as she continues to dream about the night in which she was shot. However, her dreams could be the least of her worries, as she receives an unwelcome visitor in the coming episodes, as someone enters her hospital room.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mercedes’ actions over the past year have resulted in the entire village turning on her for one reason or another. After Grace (Tamara Wall) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/30/hollyoaks-spoilers-james-nightingale-grace-black-filled-hate-mercedes-mcqueen-shot-10971092/">played her confession aloud</a> during Harry’s (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/parry-glasspool/">Parry Glasspool</a>) wake several weeks ago, The Dog’s landlady became reviled by all.</p>
      <p>As a result, one scorned resident took it upon themselves to seek revenge. As Mercedes <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/hollyoaks-spoilers-new-pictures-reveal-the-moment-before-mercedes-mcqueen-is-shot-11037881/">danced the night way in The Loft</a> on the night in question, an unknown assailant picked up the gun and shot her, leaving her for dead on the dance-floor.</p>

      <p>It was touch and go for a while, but Mercy continues to fight, and viewers have seen her experience a series of flashbacks regarding the night she was shot. In the coming episodes, these flashbacks continue, but as she sleeps, someone sneaks into her hospital room.</p>

      <p>With Mercedes’ recovery no doubt posing a risk to the shooter’s identity, has the perpetrator returned to finish the job?</p>
      <p>Mercedes’ heart rate increases as the unknown visitor watches her sleep, so it’s safe to assume that she’s aware of the uninvited guest.</p>
      <p>Is she in imminent danger?</p>
      <p>Or will someone come to her rescue before it’s too late?</p>
