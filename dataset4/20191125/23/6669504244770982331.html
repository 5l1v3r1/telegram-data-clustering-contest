      <p>VANCOUVER - Canfor says stagnant lumber markets are behind its decision to curtail all its sawmill operations over Christmas.</p>
      <p>The company says in a statement that it is curtailing operations from Dec. 23 to Jan. 3 for all its mills except the WynnWood sawmill in central Kootenay, which will be closed for five days.</p>
      <p>The forestry giant has 12 sawmills around the province.</p>
      <p>Canfor did not say how many workers are affected by the decision.</p>
      <p>The company could not be reached for comment.</p>
      <p>It says in a statement that the cuts are due to the high costs of fibre and continued weak lumber markets, making operation in the province "uneconomic."</p>
      <p>Dozens of mills around the province have either closed or scaled back operations this year over weak markets and lack of timber due to forest fires and a pine beetle infestation.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 25, 2019.</p>
