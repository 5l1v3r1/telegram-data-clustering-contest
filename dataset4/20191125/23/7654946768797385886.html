      <h1>The secret behind M. Night Shyamalan’s new horror series ‘Servant’</h1>

      <p>M. Night Shyamalan says his reputation as the master of the plot twist has been misunderstood for 20 years — dating back to his Oscar-nominated movie “The Sixth Sense,” in which Bruce Willis’ character was revealed to be dead the entire time.</p>
      <p>“For me, [the twist] is not actually something that’s of interest,” Shyamalan, 49, says in talking about his new Apple+ series, “Servant.” “Mystery or suspense inherently has a moment of awareness. If I told romantic comedies, there would be an emotional moment.</p>
      <p>“So by nature of the genre that I’m interested in, it will most likely have a moment where you realize something,” he says. “That comes more with the genre than with me.”</p>
      <p>His latest buzzy project is “Servant.” The half-hour horror/suspense series — already renewed for a second season ahead of Thursday’s premiere — follows Dorothy (Lauren Ambrose, “Six Feet Under”) and Sean Turner (Toby Kebbell, “Black Mirror”), a young couple reeling after the death of their baby. Dorothy is in such denial that when Sean uses an outlandish form of therapy — getting a doll and pretending it’s their still-living baby — she doesn’t seem to notice it isn’t real. To keep up the charade, the couple even hires a nanny, Leanne (Nell Tiger Free, “Game of Thrones”) to look after the doll and pretend it’s a human child … and things get strange and creepy really fast.</p>
      <p>“Servant” is set in the couple’s Philadelphia brownstone (Shyamalan’s home turf) and is essentially a four-actor performance between this small cast of characters (including Dorothy’s brother, Julian, played by “Harry Potter’s” Rupert Grint).</p>
      <p>“I’ve been thinking about doing a play for a long time, and maybe one day I’ll have the guts to, but this is like a play,” says Shyamalan. “We can be in one location and it’s these four actors, mainly. My dream is to do six seasons if we’re lucky enough. It’s similar to my one-location movies like ‘The Visit.’ ‘The Sixth Sense’ wasn’t one location, but it had a kind of formality in a brownstone like this. ‘The Village’ is a village but it’s one location, and ‘Split’ was that basement as a primary place.”</p>

      <p>Shymalan says he’s most interested in this repeated theme of one location. “Containment evokes a sense of incomplete with the audience — and incompleteness is a very powerful tool,” he says.</p>
      <p>Shymalan’s reputation has undergone a rocky ride following “The Sixth Sense.” His follow-up films such as “Lady in the Water” (2006) and “The Happening” (2008) opened to mixed reviews, though he’s had something of a comeback with recent films “Split” and “The Visit.” Shyamalan says he’s unruffled by the ups and downs in public opinion.</p>
      <p>“In general, as you don’t know somebody, you have generalizations,” he says. “You go, ‘Oh, he’s a partier,’ or whatever it is. Then as you get to know the person, it gets more three-dimensionalized. That relationship [with the audience] has been growing over the years, and ‘Servant’ will add another part to that.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a really interesting journey. I’m learning as well,” he says. “If ‘Unbreakable’ was my first movie that everybody saw, that would have boxed me in in the same way [as ‘The Sixth Sense’]. So whichever one was first would have been, ‘Hey, that’s you.’</p>
      <p>“And you change that definition as you go.”</p>
