      <h2>Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish was at his best as Aston Villa put Newcastle to the sword at Villa Park to climb up the table</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:01:24+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:01</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Jack Grealish was tipped for an England call up after inspiring Villa to victory against taunted ex-boss Steve Bruce.</p>
      <p>Grealish helped Villa punished Bruce with a ruthless first half goal burst to climb away from the relegation zone, with Conor Hourihane and Anwar El Ghazi netting.</p>
      <p>Bruce, who had a cabbage hurled at him during his last game in the Villa dug out in October last year, before being sacked, endured the home crowd singing: “Brucey, Brucey, what's the score?”</p>
      <p>Villa boss Smith said: “It was a big win in terms of the table. You don't want a gap opening up. It puts us near the teams above us.</p>

      <p>“Grealish was also a constant threat and got into positions. He is in a good spot. If he keeps improving he can go all the way. People speculate about England and all he can do is keep performing.</p>
      <p>“Villa Park will be big for us this season. From fifth down it is competitive. Put three results together and you can be in the top ten, or lose three and be bottom five.</p>
      <p>“It was a good performance in the first half. We controlled the ball and were relentless."</p>
      <p>Grealish said: "We have a lot of pressure on our shoulders, out of the three teams that came up we spent the most. We always knew we had a bit of pressure on us but I am sure with the players we have we can do that (stay up).”</p>

      <p>Bruce said: “It doesn't hurt more being back here. That is gone. The disappointment was we were nowhere near, passive with and without the ball.”</p>
      <p>Mis-firing Newcasle now face <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> on Saturday with Bruce conceding their £85m front line is struggling.</p>
      <p>He added: “We have to persevere with them . When they don't score the same questions will come. They have to stick at it. Strikers are about goals and they are all lacking in that department.</p>
      <p>“We needed to do a bit more, gave it away too cheaply on the counter attack. We are a third of the way through and there is plenty to play for.</p>
      <p>Ireland international Hourihane curled in a free kick from a tight angle in the 32 minute. El Ghazi then smashed home from two yards at the back post after Hourihane's brilliant cross in behind the defence.</p>
