      <p>When Americans gather with their families to gobble Thanksgiving turkey, they’ll be doing it in the middle of an impeachment inquiry for the first time in decades.</p>
      <p>American politics are getting more divisive than ever and political disagreement is bound to cause tension among some families. More than half of Americans say talking about politics with people they disagree with is generally stressful and frustrating, according to a<a href="https://www.people-press.org/2018/11/05/more-now-say-its-stressful-to-discuss-politics-with-people-they-disagree-with/"> 2018 national survey by Pew Research Center</a>.</p>
      <p>With scandals coming out of the White House almost weekly and the 2020 presidential elections less than a year away, how do you keep the perfect political storm from turning your holiday dinner into a disaster?</p>
      <p>While it’s perfectly OK for a family to decide to ban politics from the holiday dinner table, there is a way to have important conversations effectively, said Vaile Wright, a clinical psychologist and the director of research at the American Psychological Association.</p>
      <p>“This might be the only time (families) are together, and I think that these are conversations that we as citizens need to be having in order to move our country forward,” she said.</p>
      <p>Here are some tips to make sure politics doesn’t turn the holiday into an event you’re not-so-thankful for:</p>
      <h3>Don’t make it an issue if you don’t have to</h3>
      <p>Politics may not come up at all: Just 29% of Americans who are attending a Thanksgiving dinner said politics is somewhat likely to be talked about, according to <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/most-americans-arent-planning-to-talk-politics-this-thanksgiving_n_5a15ab8de4b025f8e9330546">a 2017 HuffPost/YouGov survey</a>.</p>
      <p>If you want to keep politics out of the holidays and are pretty sure your family and/or friends aren’t going to bring it up, then it’s best not to be the one to broach the subject.</p>
      <p>“Not bringing it up is better,” said etiquette expert Lizzie Post, co-president of the Emily Post Institute and great-great-granddaughter of the institute’s eponymous founder. “What you don’t want to do if you’re being open about it is to say, ‘Oh gosh, I can’t stand politics.’”</p>
      <h3>Don’t be afraid to redirect the conversation</h3>
      <p>But if politics does come up and you’d rather not deal with it, Post recommends clearly setting your boundaries.</p>
      <p>“There’s nothing wrong with saying in a really polite and friendly way that ‘I hope you’ll understand, but I’ve actually decided to take a break from politics this holiday,’” Post said.</p>
      <p>If you’re not comfortable speaking up, Post said there are other ways to politely dodge the subject. It can be tougher when you’re in a one-on-one conversation, but Post suggested glossing over the questions by asking about something like a recent vacation.</p>
      <p>“Keep redirecting that conversation,” she said. “You can always appreciate someone else’s interest in a topic without engaging in it.”</p>
      <p>But if the rest of the group is enjoying a heated political conversation, Post said it might be better to excuse yourself than to force everyone to change the subject.</p>
      <p>“It’s OK for you to just leave the conversation and say, ‘I’m going to go grab another drink’ or ‘I’m going to go see if someone needs my help in the kitchen,’” Post said.</p>
      <h3>What if I’m the one who wants to talk politics?</h3>
      <p>If you’re dying to debate the merits of each 2020 presidential candidate with that cousin you rarely see, take a minute to reflect on why you’re bringing the subject up before you start the conversation.</p>
      <p>“If you know that you have a very mixed audience or that you are the type of person who tends to enjoy when things get a little more heated or intense or debated out I think you really want to ask yourself: ‘Is this the crowd? Is this the place?’” she said.</p>
      <p>Post said if you can bring it up in a respectful way and listen to other people’s opinions then you might try to invite someone into the conversation rather than force it on them.</p>
      <p>Ask open-ended questions and enter the conversation with a goal of gaining a better understanding rather than trying to change someone’s mind, said Wright.</p>
      <p>“I really think that opens up opportunities to really have productive discussions,” she said.</p>
      <h3>What do I do if things get heated?</h3>
      <p>If someone keeps going after you and bringing up an uncomfortable subject, Post said to keep reiterating your personal boundaries in the calmest way possible.</p>
      <p>“It’s usually pretty personal territory, which is why it’s very easy for it to become fraught,” she said. “I think it’s hard for people to maintain a sense of calm in those moments.”</p>
      <p>Wright recommends trying to stick to ‘I’ statements like ‘I feel like you aren’t hearing me,’ to prevent the person you’re talking to from getting defensive. She said often times stress manifests itself physically, and if you can feel yourself getting a headache, stomachache or your body is tensing up, it’s probably time to take a break.</p>
      <p>Even if you communicate as effectively as possible, Wright said your family member might still disagree with you and you have to determine when the conversation is no longer productive.</p>
      <p>“Rely on your good coping skills: taking a walk, going to listen to music, having a cup of coffee, whatever it is that helps you kind of right yourself,” she said.</p>
      <h3>What if someone says something problematic?</h3>
      <p>There’s a difference between a heated political commentary and opinions that are actually rooted in bias. If someone says something that crosses the line, try to express how the offensive comment made you feel without attacking the person, Wright said.</p>
      <p>“When we make choices not to stand up, then we’re contributing to the problem,” said Wright. “Nobody has to put up with being called names or being subjected to racist or sexist or homophobic language ... nobody has to just sit there and take it, even if it’s your family.”</p>
      <p>Post says one of the best things you can do is to redirect the conversation in the moment and address it later in private.</p>
      <p>“You should always feel confident about letting someone know that you’re uncomfortable,” she said.</p>
