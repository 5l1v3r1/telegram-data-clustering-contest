      <p>Faye Brookes and Gareth Gates shocked fans when they split earlier this year, but the soap starlet appears to be moving on.</p>
      <p>She made her first red carpet appearance with her personal trainer Joe Davis in London tonight.</p>
      <p>The ex <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> actress, 32, looked very cosy as she cuddled up to the blonde hunk at the White Christmas musical's press night in the capital.</p>
      <p>Joe, who Faye was first linked to several months ago, wrapped an arm around her as they posed for photos together.</p>
      <p>Faye looked chic in a green dress that she'd hidden under a black coat with a fur collar.</p>

      <p>She braved the cold with bare legs and a pair of black stilettos, which she matched with her clutch bag.</p>
      <p>Joe looked dapper in a crisp white shirt, teaming it with a grey jumper, dark blue jeans and a warm black coat.</p>
      <p>Back in August it was reported that the duo had "grown close" following Faye's split from fiancé Gareth.</p>

      <p>Faye denied that there was anything romantic between them, saying she'd started working out more to distract her mind from the split.</p>
      <p>She tweeted: "It’s been a really weird week…</p>
      <p>"I've been throwing myself into the gym pretty much everyday, anyone who knows me knows how much I love training and keeping fit!"</p>

      <p>She went on: "It’s great for your physical and mental health. I’m a member of several gyms in Manchester including the fab Barry’s Bootcamp.</p>
      <p>"So (yesterday) there was a pap outside the gym when I got there, taking pictures of me &amp; getting very excited with his camera because I walked in with one of the trainers from the gym – who is a friend."</p>
      <p>Gareth was said to be "heartbroken" by the reports.</p>
