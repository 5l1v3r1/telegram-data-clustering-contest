      <h1>Chris Weidman to continue fighting despite having had 23 surgeries: ‘I feel like I’m capable of some big things’</h1>

      <p>Despite calls for retirement following back-to-back knockout losses to Ronaldo ‘Jacare’ Souza and Dominick Reyes, Chris Weidman is adamant he will continue fighting.</p>
      <p>Speaking to ESPN’s Ariel Helwani in a recent interview, the former UFC middleweight champion spoke about his recurring injuries and revealed that, despite having had 23 surgeries over the course of his professional career, ‘All-American’ will not be hanging up the gloves anytime soon.</p>

      <p>“Definitely continuing to fight, that’s not in question at all... I’ve been through hell, I’ve had 23 surgeries, but I feel good right now, I know that sounds crazy... I feel like I’m still capable of some big things.” Weidman said, per TSN’s Aaron Bronsteter.</p>
      <p>Although Weidman confirmed he will be returning to the UFC, the 35-year-old isn’t sure at which weight class. Weidman made his light heavyweight debut last month at UFC on ESPN 6 but was knocked out in the first round by Reyes.</p>

      <p>“I’m not sure if I’m going to go back to down to 185 or stay at 205,” Weidman said.</p>
      <p>Weidman is 1-5 in his last six fights and is currently unranked. Expect the UFC veteran to return to the Octagon in the new year.</p>
