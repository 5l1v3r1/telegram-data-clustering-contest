      <p>Well, if you have been using Windows 10 operating system for a while, then you might be well aware of the ‘Fast User Switching’ feature. It’s indeed a great feature that allows Windows 10 users to quickly switch from one account to another. Another thing is that it keeps the previous user signed in and their application running.</p>
      <p>So, if you have a shared PC, then it could be a convenient feature. However, it also has a few drawbacks like until an unless the second person logs out, you can’t turn off your computer. Any other PC user can access your account along with the software that you are using.</p>
      <p>Not only that, but the signed-in accounts consumes system resources in the background. So, if you are having a laptop, then this ‘Fast user switching’ feature could slow down your computer. Microsoft’s Windows 10 doesn’t provide users any built-in feature to disable the fast user switching feature. However, you can always disable it from the Registry and Local Group Policy editor.</p>
