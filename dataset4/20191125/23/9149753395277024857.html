      <h1>Samsung's ginormous 4TB 860 EVO SSD is down to $498 ($82 off)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:31:13+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-pc-gaming-deals-2019/">Black Friday</a> is Monday, apparently, and just when you think SSDs can't get cheaper... they do. While this 4TB version of the Samsung 860 Evo isn't cheap by any definition, it is a pretty good value at $497.99. That's a discount of $82 from the previous price, at $0.12 per GB. For comparison, 1TB drives are around $100 these days, placing them at $0.10 per GB.</p>
      <p>This is one of the fastest SATA drives available, capable of up to 550 MB/s reads and 520 MB/s writes. Of course, that can't hold a candle to the 3,500 MB/s read speeds that you can get from NVME drives, but it's still more than enough for Windows, games, and anything else you might need to run on your PC.</p>
      <p>This sale makes the 860 Evo one of the cheapest 4TB SATA drives available, as competing products usually go for <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?N=100011693%20600545605%20601303724%20601333076">more than $500</a>. If you need a whole lot of storage for your PC and don't want to string together a bunch of smaller drives, this isn't a bad option.</p>
