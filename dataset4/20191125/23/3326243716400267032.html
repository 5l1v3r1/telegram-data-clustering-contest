      <p>One of the more interesting projects coming to <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/apple-tv-6/">Apple TV+</a> is called <b><i>Servant</i></b> and now we know we’re getting more than just one season.</p>
      <p><i>Servant</i> is from M. Night Shyamalan (<b><i>The Sixth Sense</i></b>), and it tells a very creepy story about a family trying to make their way through a traumatic event, but who, ultimately, allow a not-so-savory presence into their home while trying to do that. It stars Toby Kebbell (<b><i>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</i></b>) and Lauren Ambrose (<b><i>Six Feet Under</i></b>) as Sean and Dorothy, respectively, and welcomes newcomer Nell Tiger Free for good measure.</p>
      <p>Rupert Grint (from the <i>Harry Potter </i>films) is also present.</p>
      <p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/servant-season-2/"><i>SlashFilm</i></a>, Apple has renewed <i>Servant</i> for a second season. And if you thought maybe you had somehow missed the series debuting on Apple’s fledgling video streaming service, fear not, because you didn’t. <i>Servant</i> is set to debut on Thursday, November 28.</p>
      <p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/06/servant-apple-tv-plus-official-trailer/">official trailer</a> for the upcoming series, just in case you need a refresher:</p>

      <p>It’s hard to say whether or not <i>Servant</i> needs a second season, considering the first hasn’t even been released yet. But apparently the creative folks behind the show believe it’s warranted. And of course, this isn’t new behavior by Apple by any means. The company has <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/10/16/appletv-plus-second-seasons/">already renewed</a> its other primary series, including <b><i>For All Mankind</i></b> and <b><i>The Morning Show</i></b> for second seasons.</p>
      <p>Are you looking forward to watching <i>Servant</i>?</p>
