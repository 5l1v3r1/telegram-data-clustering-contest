      <h1>Chinese woman gets prison, deportation for Mar-a-Lago trespass</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:31:50+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:31</time> by <a rel="author">Kenneth Garger</a></address>
      <p>A federal judge on Monday sentenced the Chinese businesswoman <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/09/woman-accused-of-sneaking-into-mar-a-lago-obsessed-with-trump-family-report/">caught trespassing at President Donald Trump’s</a> Mar-a-Lago resort to eight months in prison.</p>
      <p>Under Judge Roy Altman’s ruling, Yujing Zhang, 33, will only serve about one more week behind bars due to credit received for time served since her March 30 arrest.</p>
      <p>Upon completing the sentence, Altman ordered Zhang be turned over to immigration officials for deportation.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old Shanghai consultant was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/11/chinese-national-yujing-zhang-found-guilty-of-trespassing-at-mar-a-lago/">convicted in September</a> for sneaking into the Palm Beach resort and lying to Secret Service Agents who confronted her.</p>
      <p>When Zhang was arrested, she was carrying four cell phones, a computer and an external hard drive, leading to speculation she could be a spy.</p>
      <p>She was never charged with espionage, though, and text messages presented at trial suggest she is obsessed with Trump.</p>
      <p>The president was at a golf course when Zhang arrived at Mar-a-Lago.</p>
      <p>Leading up to Monday’s ruling, prosecutors had requested Zhang gets 18 months prison time.</p>
      <p>In addition to the lighter sentence, Zhang was also given two years of supervised release.</p>
