        <b>Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) pulled out all the stops in EastEnders to prevent Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite) from revealing that her unborn baby is Keanu Taylor’s (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/danny-walters/">Danny Walters</a>) and not Phil’s (Steve McFadden), and with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/eastenders-spoilers-shocking-scenes-mel-owen-dies-surviving-car-explosion-11127193/">Mel out of the picture</a>, you’d think that her nightmares are finally at an end. Unfortunately for her, this simply isn’t the case, as — determined to get revenge on behalf of her mate — <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lisa-fowler/">Lisa Fowler</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lucy-benjamin/">Lucy Benjamin</a>) drops the huge bombshell during Mel’s wake.</b>
      </p>
      <p>While it’s safe to assume <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/eastenders-sharon-mitchell-leaves-mel-owen-die-car-crash-11091148/">Sharon didn’t want Mel to die</a>, the one positive she can take from the situation is that her secret is safe. Well, at least that’s what she thinks, because viewers know that Mel informed Lisa of the truth before she met her maker. And while Lisa’s initial accusations haven’t convinced most, this could all change.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>In the coming episodes, Mel’s funeral arrives, and it’s certainly an emotional event for Walford’s finest. Of course, it’s Lisa that finds it the hardest, as she’s forced to bid farewell to the one person who’s been by her side whenever she needed her the most.</p>

      <p>As the wake gets underway, everyone shares their memories of Mel, but Lisa’s disgruntled when Sharon and Phil arrive. If that wasn’t bad enough, some residents take it upon themselves to praise Sharon — and Lisa’s fuming as a result.</p>
      <p>Determined to do something about it, she attempts to confront the Mitchell matriarch — but Louise (Tilly Keeper) keeps her in check.</p>

      <p>However, in spite of Louise’s comments, Lisa struggles to remain calm, and thus — during her speech in memory of her fallen friend — she <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/eastenders-spoilers-lisa-fowler-accuses-sharon-mitchell-of-murdering-mel-owen-dead-11126736/">proceeds to call Sharon a murderer</a>, before revealing the mother of all secrets.</p>
      <p>Yes, she reveals that Phil is not the father of Sharon’s baby.</p>

      <p>This isn’t the first time that Lisa’s dropped this bombshell, as viewers will remember <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/eastenders-spoilers-phil-mitchell-discovers-truth-sharon-baby-mel-owen-dead-11126982/">she told Phil after Mel’s death</a>. However, Phil didn’t believe her — and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/eastenders-spoilers-lisa-fowlers-exit-storyline-confirmed-as-phil-mitchell-threatens-to-kill-her-11177476/">threatened her if she didn’t proceed to keep her mouth shut</a>.</p>
      <p>How will Phil react? Will he believe Lisa’s words?</p>
      <p>If so, will he discover that Keanu is the dad?</p>
      <p>Or will Sharon be able to convince him otherwise?</p>
      <p>Either way, will he seek revenge on Lisa for revealing all in front of everyone?</p>
