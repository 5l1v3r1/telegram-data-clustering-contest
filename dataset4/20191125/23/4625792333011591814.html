      <h1>Supreme Court temporarily blocks House committee subpoena for Trump tax records</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:51:27+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:51</time> by <a rel="author">Carlin Becker</a></address>
      <p>The Supreme Court granted President Trump's request that a temporary hold be placed on the House Oversight Committee's access to his financial records.</p>
      <p>The top United States court <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-blocks-house-committee-from-immediately-reviewing-trumps-financial-records/2019/11/25/b73a26ac-0d79-11ea-97ac-a7ccc8dd1ebc_story.html">announced</a> on Monday an emergency stay until the justices decide whether to take up the president's appeals case, blocking House Democrats from enforcing a subpoena for his tax records that had been upheld by a lower court last month.</p>
      <p>Trump's attorneys agreed to an expedited review of a lower court ruling granting access, but the Supreme Court's move comes as a win for the president in his efforts to conceal the records from the public. There were no noted dissents in the Monday decision, and the justices set up a briefing schedule to hear arguments from both sides on whether they should hear Trump's appeal this term.</p>
      <p>While the court <a href="https://www.axios.com/supreme-court-trump-tax-returns-stay-066deaaa-bc71-42a7-954a-ed7ee5c9c356.html">did not</a> explain its reasoning, the move signals that it will likely take up the case. A ruling, however, would not be expected until mid-January, meaning the tax returns may not play a role in the House's impeachment proceedings if lawmakers plan to vote before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>The subpoena was issued in April, months before the impeachment process began. The president <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/trump-asks-supreme-court-to-shield-his-tax-returns-from-prosecutors-setting-up-historic-separation-of-power-showdown/2019/11/14/d7b176a0-04dd-11ea-8292-c46ee8cb3dce_story.html">requested</a> that the Supreme Court take up his appeal earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/25/politics/supreme-court-trump-financial-information/index.html?utm_source=twCNNp&amp;utm_content=2019-11-25T23%3A35%3A55&amp;utm_term=image&amp;utm_medium=social">must</a> now file his formal appeal of the lower court ruling on or before Dec. 5.</p>
