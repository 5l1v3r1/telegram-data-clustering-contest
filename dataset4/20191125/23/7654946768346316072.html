      <h1>‘Serial’ subject Adnan Syed won’t get a new trial, Supreme Court rules</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:40:43+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:40</time> by <a rel="author">Tamar Lapin</a></address>
      <p>Adnan Syed, the convicted killer whose story was chronicled <a href="https://nypost.com/2014/12/01/is-serial-about-to-overturn-a-15-year-old-murder-conviction/">in the hit podcast “Serial,”</a> won’t be getting a new trial, the US Supreme Court ruled on Monday.</p>
      <p>The justices chose to leave in place <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/03/08/serial-subject-adnan-syeds-conviction-reinstated-by-maryland-court/">a ruling by Maryland’s highest court</a> in March, that denied Syed’s bid for a new trial based on information uncovered in the 2014 audio series.</p>
      <p>Millions of people tuned in to hear the story of Syed, who is serving a life sentence after being found guilty in 2000 of strangling his 17-year-old high school ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee, and burying her body in a Baltimore park.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said Syed killed her after she broke up with him.</p>
      <p>His current lawyer had argued that his trial attorney, the late Cristina Gutierrez, failed to pursue a classmate’s claims that she saw Syed at the Woodlawn Public Library at 2:15 p.m. on Jan. 13, 1999 — right when investigators say Lee was being strangled to death.</p>
      <p>Two Maryland courts <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/03/29/convicted-killer-profiled-in-serial-podcast-granted-new-trial/">found that Syed deserved a new trial</a>.</p>
      <p>But the Maryland Court of Appeals denied Syed a new trial, saying there was little chance the outcome would have been different even if Gutierrez had done the work she should have.</p>
      <p>Syed’s attorney said he and his client were “deeply disappointed” by the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the ruling.</p>
      <p>“But by no means is this the end of Adnan Syed,” said C. Justin Brown. “There are other legal options and we are exploring each and every one of them.”</p>
      <p>Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said the evidence against Syed “was overwhelming.”</p>
      <p>“We remain confident in the verdict that was delivered by the jury and are pleased that justice for Hae Min Lee has been done,” he said in a statement.</p>
