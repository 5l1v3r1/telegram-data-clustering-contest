      <h1>Kirk Herbstreit Reveals His Top 5 Teams Of Week 13</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:54:40+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>College football’s Week 13 is in the books. This past week’s slate of games didn’t feature many highly-anticipated contests, but it still brought about several shocking results and upsets.</p>
      <p>As he does each week, ESPN’s Kirk Herbstreit has revealed his top 5 (or in this case, six) teams of the previous weekend. To no surprise, the Arizona State Sun Devils claim the top spot on the list after upsetting No. 6 Oregon in dramatic fashion.</p>
      <p>ASU quarterback Jayden Daniels had a monster game, throwing for 408 yards and three touchdowns. The Sun Devils jumped out to a 24-7 lead late in the fourth quarter before the Ducks attempted a ferocious comeback – but it was all too late. ASU held on to beat Oregon 31-28, knocking the Ducks out of the College Football Playoff race.</p>
      <p>Here’s the rest of Herbstreit’s top 5 teams of Week 13:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Arizona State</li>
        <li>FIU</li>
        <li>Charlotte</li>
        <li>Cal</li>
        <li>Minnesota and Baylor</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The FIU Panthers shocked Miami on Saturday night, coming away with a 30-24 victory. Not only was it a huge win for the Panthers, but it’s sparked questions surrounding Manny Diaz’s future with the Hurricanes.</p>
      <p>Charlotte football knocked off Marshall 24-13, becoming bowl eligible for the first time in school history in the process.</p>

      <p>Cal comes in at No. 4 on Herbstreit’s top 5 list after the Golden Bears ended their losing streak to Stanford with a 24-20 win on Saturday.</p>
      <p>At No. 5, Herbstreit gives the nod to two teams – Minnesota and Baylor. Both teams bounced back from losses last week. The Golden Gophers beat Northwestern 38-22 while Baylor took care of business against Texas, 24-10.</p>
