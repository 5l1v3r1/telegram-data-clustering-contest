      <p>Cam'ron girlfriend Tawasa Harris reportedly passed away and it took her beau a while before reacting to publicly to the tragic news. The Dipset headman posted a heartfelt tribute to Harris on IG. Cam'ron's message read:Â </p>
      <p>"First off I want to thank my family, friends and fans for their condolences, I really appreciate it. This is not my sons mother (my sons mother is fine) this is someone I went out with years ago, and we got back together a year and a half ago. And I had the best time of my life during that period. She was the person I spent 3-4nights a week with, the person I spoke to on the phone with 7-8times a day, the person I fell asleep on the phone with, the person I spent all summer with, the person that I was planning thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years and our birthdays with, the person who put me on to hi-end fashion, my biggest supporter, the person that wouldnâ€™t let u talk about me while she was around, I could go on and on..but..this was really the love of my life!! I had so many close people die, I thought I was numb to death, but this past week has taught me im not. I chose to keep this relationship private because of the same way the media is acting now. Speculating, reporting with out facts etc. but Tee Iâ€™m truly going to miss you. You are my best friend.. and the the true definition of HOMIE, LOVER, FRIEND. My condolences go to her entire family. Especially her 3 kids, Mom, brother, and Logan. She loved all of you guys unconditionally. Time for me to get out and get back to it. I know thatâ€™s what she would want.. #BestFriends ðŸ’”"</p>
