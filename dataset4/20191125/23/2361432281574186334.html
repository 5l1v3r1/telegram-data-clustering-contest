      <h2>Network will celebrate Scott’s love of life and perseverance through his fight with cancer as part of ESPN’s “V Week for Cancer Research”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:06:03+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/debbie-emery/" target="_blank">Debbie Emery</a></address>
      <p>Monday, December 4 is going to be “as cool as the other side of the pillow.”</p>
      <p>ESPN has officially designated it “Stuart Scott Day,” in honor of the beloved “SportsCenter” anchor who lost his hard-fought battle with cancer in January 2015 at age 49.</p>
      <p>Throughout Dec. 4, ESPN will celebrate with frequent content of Scott’s love of life and perseverance through his fight with cancer, the network announced Monday. The coverage is part of the ESPN’s 13th annual “V Week for Cancer Research,” which runs Sunday, Dec. 3 through Dec. 14.</p>

      <p>Throughout the week, ESPN will drive awareness and funds for the V Foundation for Cancer Research across all platforms and proceeds will go directly to cancer research and related programs. Last year, “V Week” helped raise a record $8.3 million, bringing the 12-year total of contributions to more than $30.5 million.</p>
      <p>“‘V Week’ leverages ESPN platforms and partners to drive awareness of the continued fight against cancer and generates donations to the V Foundation,” Kevin Martinez, vice president, ESPN Corporate Citizenship, said in a statement. “This year, we celebrate our dear friend and colleague, and the 2014 Jimmy V Perseverance Award winner Stuart Scott, by honoring his courageous spirit to ‘Fight Like Hell.’</p>
      <p>“We’re honored to once again celebrate ‘V Week’ and inspire fans to help support the V Foundation to one day eradicate cancer,” Martinez added.</p>

      <p>Scott, who joined ESPN in 1993 for the launch of ESPN2, was diagnosed with cancer in November 2007 and dealt with recurring bouts of the disease. He eventually succumbed on Jan. 4, 2015 at age 49, but not before leaving the world with an iconic ESPYs speech that would become part of his legacy.</p>
      <p>“When you die, it does not mean that you lose to cancer. You beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and in the manner in which you live,” he said when accepting the Jimmy V Perseverance Award in July 2014.</p>
      <p>“So live. Live. Fight like hell and when you get too tired to fight then lay down and rest and let somebody else fight for you.”</p>
      <p>Scott was survived by his two daughters, Taelor and Sydni, and continues to be honored through the Stuart Scott Memorial Cancer Research Fund, the Stuart Scott Foundation and the Stuart Scott ENSPIRE Award.</p>

      <p>See the rest of 2019 “V Week” programming below:</p>
      <p>The 2019 “V Week” will feature several new initiatives to raise funds for the V Foundation, including:</p>
      <p>• Stuart Scott Day: In honor of famed ESPN television personality and 2014 Jimmy V Perseverance Award recipient Stuart Scott, who passed away from cancer in 2015, ESPN is dedicating Monday, Dec. 4, as “Stuart Scott Day.” On that day, ESPN will showcase content, which depicts Scott’s love of life and perseverance through his fight with cancer and his consistent message to “never give up.” A special, limited edition Stuart Scott t-shirt will go on sale starting Dec. 4 and all net proceeds of sales will benefit the V Foundation for Cancer Research.</p>
      <p>• UFC “Fight Like Hell” Night: On Saturday, Dec. 7, UFC is dedicating its fight to the Stuart Scott Memorial Cancer Research Fund, which supports groundbreaking minority cancer research. Scott had a strong connection to mixed martial arts and even trained during his treatments. “Fight Like Hell” Night will feature Stuart Scott-related content all throughout fight night and the UFC will be donating $XX to the Stuart Scott Memorial Cancer Research Fund in support of Stuart Scott.</p>
      <p>• “Ring the Bell to Knock Out Cancer” Night: Also during V Week, Top Rank will raise awareness and funds for the V Foundation by dedicating Saturday, Dec. 14, as “Ring the Bell to Knock Out Cancer” night. Within boxing, “ringing of the bell” symbolizes the end of the fight, and for patients with cancer and their healthcare team, the “ringing of the bell” is a significant moment as well, signaling the end of active treatment and the beginning of a life free of cancer. The “ringing of the bell” will be a symbolic moment during the Top Rank fight, making fans aware of ESPN’s dedication to eradicating cancer. The fight will air on ESPN, Saturday, Dec. 14, at 9 p.m. ET.</p>
      <p>• “Don’t Give Up on Me” Anthem: Multi-platinum selling pop artist Andy Grammer is invested in the mission to find cures for cancer, having lost his mother to breast cancer. The lyrics of his song “Don’t Give Up on Me” fit perfectly with the themes of fighting adversity, supporting a loved one, having belief in dark times and ultimately not giving up. Grammer’s song “Don’t Give Up on Me” will air during V Week campaigns, which aligns with the V Foundation theme of fighting adversity and motto of “Don’t Give Up . . . Don’t Ever Give Up!”</p>

"Time is very precious to me. I don't know how much I have left and I have some things I would like to say." The N. C. State basketball coach was battling terminal bone cancer and died less than two months later.<cite>ESPN</cite></figcaption>

Sam quoted Arthur Ashe, telling the audience: "Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can.” The University of Missouri alum went on to tell the audience: "Those were the words to live by, whether you're black or white, young or old, straight or gay ...

Up until then, few knew the extent of Scott’s cancer battle as he never let the struggle show on-air, but the sports broadcaster took the entire room with him on a beautiful, tear-jerking journey. “You beat cancer by how you live, why you live and in the manner in which you live. So live. Live. Fight like hell and when you get too tired to fight then lay down and rest and let somebody else fight for you."

Too sick to attend the ESPYs herself, the brave little girl said via video: “Sorry I couldn’t be here, everybody. Thank you for supporting me while I beat out cancer,” before her dad sent the message “don’t give up.” Two years later, Leah is cancer-free and the face of the Still Strong Foundation.<cite>Photo by Joe Faraoni/ESPN Images</cite></figcaption>

Maybe it was simply that we knew no matter what, he was a winner regardless,” Affleck said. "He broke my heart 100 times, if not more. And he broke it again when he retired.”<cite>Photo by Joe Faraoni/ESPN Images</cite></figcaption>
