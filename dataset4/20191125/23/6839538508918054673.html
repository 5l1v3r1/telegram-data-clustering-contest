      <p>The spring market is showing no signs of slowing down as December approaches, with the Sydney recording another “boomtime” auction result.</p>
      <p>Sydney notched up a weekend clearance rate of 80 per cent, higher than the previous weekend’s 78 per cent and well ahead of the 44 per cent over the same weekend last year.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s result was the second at or above 80 per cent over the past three weekends, Dr Wilson noted.</p>
      <p>“Sydney remains clearly the strongest home auction market of all the capital cities with robust buyer depth continuing to produce remarkable results for sellers generally,” Dr Wilson from My Housing Market said.</p>

      <p>Next weekend is the last in the spring selling season and also the busiest auction Saturday of the year.</p>
      <p>Agents says the low cost of finance is prompting heightened levels of buyer interest.</p>
      <p>The low rate mortgage market­ “is hot right now with great deals and rate cuts being announced every week,” financial comparison site InfoChoice.com.au chief executive Vadim Taube noted.</p>
      <p>“If your bank is not offering you a great discounted rate, you can find alternatives that can reduce your repayments by hundreds of dollars per month really easily at the moment­,” Taube said.</p>
      <p>The lowest variable home loan comparison rate is 2.7 per cent per annum with 110 variable home loan products for owner-occupiers now charging advertised rates less than 3.3 per cent per annum.</p>
      <p>With housing supply for sale remaining low and buyer demand rising, the fear of missing out had again become a factor in the market as buyers sense some urgency to buy before prices rise further, CoreLogic auction analyst Kevin Brogan said.</p>
      <p>It will be telling to see whether clearance rates can hold up under the further increased level of supply, he said.</p>
      <p>“Over the next few weeks we will see the depth of buyer demand tested,” Brogan said.</p>
      <p>CoreLogic calculated 934 auctions were held in Sydney over the past week. One year ago 1035 auctions were held and the clearance rate came in at 44 per cent.</p>
      <p>The cheapest weekend sale was $310,000 in Auburn. The two-bedroom Dartbrook Rd unit was on the market for the first time since 1987 when it had sold at $48,000, according to CoreLogic.</p>

      <p>Sydney’s top sale was in Mosman when Raine &amp; Horne agents secured $4.7 million for a four-bedroom Bradleys Head Rd apartment, which had previously sold at $3.01 million in 2011.</p>
      <p>Hopes for an Australian auction record failed to eventuate when a Point Piper trophy mansion was pulled from its scheduled Saturday auction. The home on Wingadal Place had initially come with overly ambitious $60 million­ price hopes. Its last reported guide was revised to $50 million to $55 million.</p>
      <p>It has been the Sydney bolt­hole of the London-based expat environmental lawyer and lecturer Sarah Cooke, who is married to hedge funder Dominic­ Redfern.</p>
      <p>Cooke paid $7.95 million for the property in 2006 and then commissioned Jonathan Temple and James Stockwell to design the three-level home that has five bedrooms, six bathrooms, and a lift.</p>
      <p>The national auction record has stood since 2009 at $23 million in Bellevue Hill.</p>
      <h3>FAST AND FURIOUS BIDDING</h3>
      <p>Auctioneer James Keenan secured $1.78 million when a Glebe downsizer bought a three-bedroom Stanmore offering. Keenan described the bidding as “fast and furious”.</p>
      <p>“The price paid was $80,000 over the reserve,” he said. “It was the perfect property to sell as it attracted every type of buying group — upsizers, downsizers and investors.</p>
      <p>“It was on a single level so older people liked it. It’s got parking, plus it’s north-facing and near the green.”</p>
      <p>“It had it all,” Ray White selling agent Ercan Ersan noted.</p>

      <p>The auction stopped traffic on Temple St, with a crowd of more than 100 watching on to see 14 registered bidders fight it out.</p>
      <p>The auction kicked off at $1.588 million, just above its $1.575 million last sale price, four years ago.</p>
      <h3>ARCHITECT’S DREAM STILL ON MARKET</h3>
      <p>A mid-century modern Northwood home failed to sell at weekend auction, despite a raft of architectural devotees loving the home.</p>
      <p>The four-bedroom early-1960s Pendray Close home was designed by architect William Workman, with its de rigueur open-plan living and dining area.</p>
      <p>“Large windows and polished timber floors feature throughout this warm and inviting property,” listing agent Bernadette Hayes at Harbourline Real Estate said.</p>
      <p>It now has a $1.95 million asking price, with the vendor off to Melbourne.</p>
      <p>It last sold in 2015 at $1,587,000 through Hayes.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It is a double-brick family home on 556 sqm of land among the tree tops opposite Lane Cove Golf Club.</p>
      <p>The Modernist Australia website described the home as “effortlessly stunning and sophisticated”.</p>
      <p>The house had more than 3200 realestate.com.au views, well above the suburb’s typical 2500 views.</p>
      <p>Northwood has just the two home listings, and a $2.75 million median based on 12 sales in the past year.</p>
      <h3>SLOW MOVING IN MOSMAN</h3>
      <p>Channel 9 director Patrick Allaway and wife Elizabeth pulled their Mosman bolthole from weekend auction but it is still up for sale.</p>

      <p>The property’s LJ Hooker Avnu agents Michael Coombs and Eliza Patrick maintain a $3 million guidance for the three-bedroom home, but buyers haven’t rushed to the opportunity.</p>
      <p>The Avalon Beach-based couple paid $3.1 million in 2017 and renovated the 1920s semi.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/69B656BFA2979CCAC6DA614C3A60AE65/1574726727119_2be5898224baaec3ce95c40d8607532a.jpeg?imwidth=668&amp;impolicy=pn_v3"/>
        <figcaption>Camera IconCredit: Supplied</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The listing had 3800 realestate.com.au views in its initial month on market, three times the usual amount.</p>
      <h3>AUCTION PRE-SALE</h3>
      <p>The Wedge House, one of Whale Beach’s most architecturally identifiable properties, was snapped up 24 hours ahead of its scheduled weekend auction.</p>
      <p>The price guide had been $2.95 million, with LJ Hooker agent David Edwards securing $3.15 million.</p>

      <p>Edwards said the resale price indicated that the market was up close to 10 per cent over the past six months, “particularly in the $2.5 million to $4 million price range”.</p>
      <p>The buyers were a northern beaches couple who plan to make it their primary home.</p>

      <p>The 2000-built home was sold by TV audience researcher David Castran, whose work meant he was spending more time in Melbourne. He paid $2.92 million five months ago.</p>
      <p>Architect Peter Stutchbury and colleague Marika Jarv designed the house for Deon and Kim Huber, co-founders of not-for-profit organisation Living Ocean.</p>

      <p>The eco-friendly three-bedroom home, with two wedges that extend in opposite directions, sits in Pape Landscape gardens.</p>
      <h3>GENERATIONAL CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP</h3>
      <p>A three-bedroom Cronulla home, offered for the first time since its construction, fetched $2.53 million at a weekend auction.</p>
      <p>Jon Brookes at Brookes Partners Real Estate had 15 registered bidders when Cooley Auctions offered the unrenovated single-storey 1960s home.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/69B656BFA2979CCAC6DA614C3A60AE65/1574726727119_5f6056f142226b1653b6fd4ddb6e90ed.jpeg?imwidth=668&amp;impolicy=pn_v3"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Cronulla has 20 houses for sale, realestate.com.au data shows, with many signalling a generational shift after long ownership.</p>
      <p>There’s a deceased estate auction next weekend on Wilshire Ave, offered for the first time in four decades.</p>

      <p>CoreLogic put the typical ownership period for sales at 14 years. Brookes said the Links Ave brick homebuyer was likely to rebuild on its 626 sqm block.</p>
      <p>Another 1960s home sold for first time last year for $1,565,000 on Kingsway has been relisted in what will be a signal of any price growth, although CoreLogic says there has been none.</p>
      <p>Cronulla’s median price over the past year for houses sits at about $1.9 million.</p>
