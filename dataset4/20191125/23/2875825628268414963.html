      <p>I'm A Celebrity campmates Ian Wright and Caitlyn Jenner look set to be punished on the ITV jungle series, after being caught with contrband.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn sneaked some chicken and corn on the cob into the camp through her trouser pocket for a hungry Ian.</p>
      <p>All the contestants minus Myles Stephenson, Kate Garraway, Andy Whyment and Nadine Coyle took part in a live trial hosted by Ant and Dec on Sunday.</p>
      <p>They had the option to win a roast dinner for all 12 campmates, but unfortunately Roman Kemp and James Haskell failed to secure Andy Whyment, Ian and Cliff Parisi a meal after failing the final challenge.</p>
      <p>But that didn't stop Caitlyn from doing what was right in the latest episode, deciding that if Ian couldn't be taken to the roast, the roast would be taken to Ian.</p>

      <p>Now, Ant McPartlin has hinted the rule break has been "noted".</p>
      <p>He and co-host Dec Donnelly then hinted a punishment was due for Caitlyn and Ian over the "contraband".</p>
      <p>Ant initially said: "Contraband in camp...noted," before revealing the result of the Bushtucker Trial vote.</p>

      <p>Then on spin-off show Extra Camp, host Emily Atack asked whether they would get away with the rule break.</p>
      <p>Ant then said: "We've noted it, it's been noted."</p>
      <p>On if Ian had gotten away with it, he added: "He thought he had..."</p>

      <p>So it seems bosses are onto the pair, and the campmates could pay the price for the treat.</p>
      <p>Not only that but it seems Andy and Cliff, who didn't get leftovers, may find out.</p>
      <p>Ian denied anything happened when appearing in the Bush Telegraph after devouring the corn and chicken.</p>
      <p>He was shown on camera munching on the food, while Caitlyn was clearly seen handing it over.</p>
