      <p>Born 10 weeks early and weighing just 480g, twin Eloise Fleming was given just a 5 per cent chance of survival. Here’s her amazing story.</p>
      <p>She might have been tiny but Eloise’s huge heart surprised everyone as she conquered every challenge thrown at her.</p>
      <p>Today, 15-month-old Eloise continues to astonish her parents with her progress.</p>
      <p>“She’s our little miracle baby. She’s fought through so much,” said proud mother Nicole Fleming.</p>
      <p>Eloise and twin sister Isla, who tipped the scales at 1560g, entered the world 10 weeks premature.</p>
      <p>They had a rare condition called twin-to-twin transfusion – meaning they were in two separate sacs but shared the same placenta in the womb.</p>

      <p>Doctors told Nicole and husband Shannon the condition made chances of both girls surviving after birth slim.</p>
      <p>Because of her extra weight, doctors were slightly more confident of Isla’s chances.</p>
      <p>“We made a lot of our decisions based on getting Isla out safely and hoping that Eloise would just hold on a little bit longer,” Ms Fleming said.</p>
      <p>But a rare perforated bowel after a heart surgery resulted in Isla’s tragic death at just four weeks old.</p>
      <p>The Forest Range couple and their other children – Amelia, 10, Eamon, 8, and Ciara, 7 – spent months in the Women’s and Children’s Hospital during the twins’ journey.</p>
      <p>In appreciation, the Flemings have donated more than $60,000 to the WCH’s neonatal unit.</p>
      <p>The WCH Foundation’s Christmas campaign launched on November 21.</p>
