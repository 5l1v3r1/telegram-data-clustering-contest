      <h1>Michael Bloomberg goes after Trump in first day on campaign trail</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:06:20+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:06</time> by <a rel="author">Bob Fredericks and Carl Campanile</a></address>
      <p>Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/michael-bloombergs-campaign-faces-challenges-from-both-the-left-and-right/">spent his first full day on the presidential campaign trail</a> with a full-throated attack on President Donald Trump, warning that America might not survive a second term by the commander-in-chief.</p>
      <p>“If President Trump wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage that he can do,” the former three term Gotham mayor told voters during an event in Roanoke, Virginia.</p>
      <p>“The stakes could not be higher. We must win this election. And we must begin rebuilding America – by investing here at home, and restoring our nation’s credibility and moral leadership abroad.”</p>
      <p>Bloomberg said he was making his first appearance in Virginia because Democrats flipped the state Legislature in the state, where Hilary Clinton won by 5.3 points in 2016.</p>
      <p>“You may ask, why am I kicking my campaign off right here in Norfolk? It is because southeastern Virginia proves that – with the right candidate – we can turn areas from red to blue,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We need to do that all across this country. We cannot afford four more years of President Trump’s reckless and unethical actions. He is an existential threat to our country, to our values, and our national security,” continued Bloomberg, 77, whom Trump has <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/08/trump-dismisses-michael-bloombergs-possible-2020-bid-little-michael-will-fail/">mocked as “Little Michael.”</a></p>
      <p>“Every day it seems to bring another example of just how unfit he is to serve as our president and commander-in-chief, and this week was no exception,” he added, referring to Trump’s order <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/def-sec-esper-fires-navy-sec-spencer-over-handling-of-seals-review/">canning Navy Secretary Richard Spencer</a>.</p>
      <p>“Yesterday, many of you read, the President forced out the Secretary of the Navy – a Marine veteran – for upholding the military’s commitment to the rule of law. Secretary Spencer wrote, and I quote: ‘I cannot in good conscience obey an order that I believe violates the sacred oath I took to support and defend the Constitution of the United States,’ ” he said in the city that houses the US’s largest naval base, calling it “an extraordinary rebuke.”</p>
      <p>The billionaire businessman, who founded his eponymous media company, also touted his experience in the corporate world and government.</p>
      <p>“I believe my unique set of experiences in business, government, and philanthropy will enable me to both win and to lead. As a candidate, I’ll rally a broad and diverse coalition to win. And as president, I will have the skills to fix what is broken in our great nation. And there is a lot broken,” he said.</p>
      <p>He also railed against income inequality, gun violence and Trump’s immigration and climate change politics — while hailing his days as a Boy Scout.</p>
      <p>As a child and a Boy Scout, I was taught to believe in the promise and potential of America, and I’ve never been more worried about its future than I am today,” he said.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg was expected to self fund his campaign, and has surrounded himself with trusted veterans of his earlier campaigns and business career.</p>
      <p>Marc Lavorgna, his national press secretary, was a mayoral press secretary while Kevin Sheekey, a top adviser for Bloomberg at Bloomberg LP and when he was mayor, is campaign manager.</p>
      <p>Veteran political operative Howard Wolfson, a former deputy mayor, is top political adviser, and Stu Loeser, communications manager when Bloomberg was mayor, is doing work for the campaign.</p>
      <p>Another vet, Bradley Tusk, Bloomberg’s campaign manager in his third bid for the mayoralty, serves as an outside adviser, and Bill Knapp is doing Bloomberg’s ads, the same role he played during his mayoral races.</p>
      <p>And the Massachusetts native touted his experience as a uniter as opposed to Trump’s reputation as a divider.</p>
      <p>“America is at its best when we work together to find meaningful and lasting solutions to our big challenges. We need a president who understands that truth – and who can do it, rather than just make promises,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It has worked well in business – and in running the country’s largest, most progressive city, and it can work in Washington, as well.”</p>
      <p>Bloomberg has <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/bloomberg-apologizes-for-stop-and-frisk-police-policy/">tried to blunt</a> two of the most potent issues — his enthusiastic support for the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk program and his history of crude, sexist remarks.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, he resigned his post as the UN special envoy for climate action.</p>
      <p>UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Monday that Bloomberg sent a letter to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Nov. 11 saying he was stepping down from the UN post.</p>
