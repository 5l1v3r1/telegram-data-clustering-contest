      <p>We're learning more about the year-long investigation that led federal agents to raid a multimillion-dollar home northwest of Tucson last week.</p>
      <p>Raul Garcia Cordova, 47, was arrested after Homeland Security Investigations agents executed a search warrant at his home near the intersection of Moore Road and Como Drive Thursday. Investigators say their search turned up marijuana, vape pens, equipment to make vape pens, drug ledgers and plenty of cash.</p>
      <p>KGUN 9 was there when agents hauled away multiple vehicles including SUVs, pickup trucks, a sports car, a trailer and a motorboat.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The complaint against homeowner Raul Garcia Cordova says he bankrolled an operation that used UPS to ship vape pens that dispense THC, the psycho-active ingredient in marijuana. He's now facing 13 charges, including drug manufacturing, money laundering and weapons violations.</p>

      <p>New court documents filed Thursday reveal he's not the only one implicated in the investigation.</p>
      <p>The documents say agents and detectives began their investigation last November.</p>
      <p>They say in June they bought 100 THC vape pens, then in September seized multiple THC vape pens from a Vape shop that had purchased the pens from the organization.</p>
      <p>Detectives describe 32-year-old Fernando Navarro-Figueroa as being in charge of the stash house where some of the illegal items were stored, and in charge of multiple members of the drug trafficking organization.</p>

      <p>Court clerks say the investigation resulted in 11 defendants altogether. Their indictments haven't yet been filed in court.</p>
      <p>Cardova is jailed unless he can post a bond of $250,000 cash. Navarro will need to post $75,000 in cash to bond out.</p>
