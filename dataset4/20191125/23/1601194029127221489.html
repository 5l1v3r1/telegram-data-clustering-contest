      <p>We have an incredibly stacked roundup for you today. It's <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">Survivor Series</a> weekend, what else did you expect?</p>
      <p>There are tons of newsworthy rumors to discuss coming out of WWE's latest PPV offering. Despite the positive reviews about the show, Vince McMahon is reportedly unhappy with one of the biggest matches on the card.</p>
      <p>There was another interesting piece of speculation about the same match that came to light.</p>
      <p>There was also a backstage note about a tantalizing plan that <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> has in store for CM Punk.</p>
      <p>The man of the moment, Keith Lee, predictably also features in the rumour lineup for today.</p>
      <p>There was a lot of buzz surrounding the ongoing controversy between Mauro Ranallo and Corey Graves that has also been covered.</p>
      <p>That's not all, Bray Wyatt, Matt Riddle and Finn Balor make it to today's edition as well. We have a lot to cover, so let's check out the biggest rumors doing the rounds.</p>

      <h4>#1. Vince McMahon unhappy with the Survivor Series main event</h4>

      <p>Survivor Series was a solid show. However, the main event, quite frankly, was a major disappointment.</p>
      <p>The 18-minute headliner between <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/becky-lynch">Becky Lynch,</a> Shayna Baszler and Bayley felt pale in comparison to all the other matches on the night.</p>
      <p>It has now been revealed via WrestleVotes that even <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/vince-mcmahon">Vince McMahon</a> wasn't a big fan of the closing match.</p>
      <blockquote>Heard even Vince himself didnâ€™t like the main event last night. Major disappointment.</blockquote>

      <p>We can't argue with the WWE boss here as the Triple Threat main event failed to keep the fans invested. The All-State Arena was dead all throughout the match and that hurt the overall impact of the contest.</p>
      <p>The heavily-rumoured return of Ronda Rousey also didn't happen, which may have diverted some of the attention from the lacklustre affair.</p>
      <p>Shayna Baszler managed to have her moment under the sun by beating the RAW and SmackDown Women's Champions before Becky Lynch attacked the Queen of Spades to end the show on top. There were a lot of booking decisions that could have been made here, but WWE instead went for the least interesting one of the lot.</p>
