      <p>Colin Kaepernick was hoping to drum up some interest from teams around the league after his workout almost two weeks ago, but so far, nobody has contacted his representatives to possibly sign him to a team.</p>
      <p>To get their attention once again, the free agent quarterback dropped an insane hype video of his workout at a local high school.</p>

      <p>Kaepernick has been out of the league since starting the National Anthem protests back in 2016. He ended up suing the league and its owners, accusing them of colluding to keep him without a job. That was settled earlier this year with an undisclosed figure.</p>
