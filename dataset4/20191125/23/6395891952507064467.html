      <p><b>CLEVELANDÂ (AP)</b> - Cavaliers forward Kevin Love is out for the second straight game because of a sore back.</p>
      <p>Love, who leads the team in scoring and rebounding, isn't playing Monday against Brooklyn. He was sidelined Saturday when Cleveland snapped a six-game losing streak by beating Portland.</p>
      <p>Love had been listed as questionable and the team announced he wasn't playing after he went through pregame warmups.</p>
      <p>Cavaliers coach John Beilein says the team is being cautious with the 31-year-old Love, who was also out on Nov. 18 against New York with the back issue. Love played the following two games, but aggravated the injury Friday in Dallas.</p>
      <p>Love averages 17.9 points and 11.8 rebounds in 14 games. The five-time All-Star is in his 12th season. Larry Nance Jr. started at power forward for the second straight game.</p>
