      <h1>People living under cyclone risk have tripled since 1971: Professor Kerry Emanuel</h1>
      <h2>He was speaking at the conference titled ‘Prediction skill of extreme precipitation events and tropical cyclones: present status and future prospects’.</h2>

      <p>Experts discussed the rising risk of cyclones to humans at the inaugural session of an international conference and the annual climate change workshop at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) on Monday.</p>
      <p>“The global meteorologist community needs to unite to develop long-term forecast of risk assessment and work closely with policymakers on planning strategies to tackle cyclones and their aftermath,” said Professor Kerry Emanuel, co-director, Lorenz Center at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
      <p>He was speaking at the conference titled ‘Prediction skill of extreme precipitation events and tropical cyclones: present status and future prospects’.</p>
      <p>“The global meteorologist community is not doing enough for the long-term risk assessment and it has to take into consideration the effects of climate change. We cannot leave it all upon the statisticians, insurance companies and risk modellers,” Emanuel said.</p>
      <p>Explaining the rising threat of cyclones, he said, “There is increased migration of population towards the coasts. Since 1971, the global population living with the risk of cyclones has tripled. We need to focus on floods and other effects that cyclones could cause rather than remaining limited to tracking and predicting the intensity of an approaching cyclone.”</p>
      <p>According to Professor Graeme Stephen of NASA, further studies to understand the rising precipitation trend globally will require detailed study of clouds, convection, precipitation and their link with aerosols. “Precipitation all over the globe will increase but regional changes will not be the same and it is still not well understood,” said Stephen.</p>
      <p>For the first time, India’s climate inputs will be considered in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which will be released in 2020. The Centre for Climate Change Research at IITM, which has contributed to this report, is also in the process of preparing an assessment report with special focus on India.</p>
      <p>Delegates and climate scientists from more than 10 countries will participate in the conference that ends on November 28.</p>
