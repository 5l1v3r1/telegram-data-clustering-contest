      <p>Since his recent debut in the middleweight division, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/darren-till">Darren Till</a> has been full of confidence and in a recent interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/jmnlk9klF2w">BT Sport</a>, 'The Gorilla' declared himself as the top draw in the UFC Middleweight Division.</p>
      <h3>Darren Till labels himself the top draw in the UFC Middleweight Division</h3>
      <p>At the recently concluded UFC 244 pay-per-view, Darren Till made his debut at the UFC Middleweight Division and in his first fight at 185, the Liverpool based fighter defeated Kelvin Gastelum via unanimous decision.</p>
      <p>While recently speaking to BT Sport, Till stated that people usually tend to forget the fighter he was prior to his loss to Tyron Woodley and Jorge Masvidal, as he recalled his win against Stephen Thompson, whom he labeled as the 'best striker in UFC' and also briefly spoke about his victory over Donald 'Cowboy' Cerrone. (H/T: <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/ufc-darren-till-money-man-middleweight">MMA Junkie</a>)</p>
      <blockquote>“The people forget the fighter I was before I got knocked out. Forget the Woodley fight. People forget the fighter I was, what I done to the best striker in the UFC, Stephen Thompson, where I calm and calculatedly beat him, nearly knocked him out. Look at the performance he’s just had, or before that (Donald Cerrone), or before that all the European stars I was just taking out, or before that when I was in Brazil just taking names, or even before that. So now they’re all just calling me out. I’m the money man in the division.”</blockquote>
      <h3>What's next for Darren Till?</h3>
      <p>As of now, it looks like Darren Till is set to step into the Octagon against former UFC Middleweight Champion Robert Whittaker.</p>
