      <p>A proposal to ban camping in Vernon's Polson Park — while allowing a camp at City Hall — along with shortening the amount of time homeless people are allowed to camp, will not move forward.</p>
      <p>The two motions put forward by Councillor Scott Anderson were defeated with Anderson the only councillor voting in favour of the proposals during today's Nov. 25 meeting.</p>
      <p>One of the motions put forward by Anderson <a href="https://infotel.ca/newsitem/vernon-councillor-calls-for-homeless-to-be-allowed-to-camp-outside-city-hall/it67573">proposed to ban camping in Polson Park</a> and instead open up the grounds at City Hall for camping.</p>
      <p>Current City bylaws allow camping in certain parks from dusk to 9 a.m. and Coun. Anderson's other motion proposed to change this to 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.</p>
      <p>“Let's bring the issue... right back to City Hall,” Anderson told today's meeting. “(And) give Polson Park back to the taxpayers.”</p>
      <p>Anderson said his motion was meant to bring the homelessness issue to the forefront and show the community that City Hall was listening.</p>
      <p>However, while Councillor Kari Gares said she appreciated where Anderson was coming from, she could not support the motion.</p>
      <p>Councillor Brian Quiring was more outspoken.</p>
      <p>“It's going to be terrible for the downtown,” Quiring said. “No one's going to camp here.”</p>
      <p>Quiring said the ban would simply move the issue to another area of the city.</p>
      <p>Anderson said that was “exactly the point.” He said said Polson Park was the first place tourists saw when they entered the city.</p>
      <p>“Polson Park used to be the gem of Vernon,” Gares said. “We've lost that over the years.”</p>
      <p>While Anderson said people were too scared to use the park, Councillor Dalvir Nahal said she was “more afraid of the goose poop” in the park.</p>
      <p>Quiring said he would be in favour of a total camping ban in the park but did not propose a Notice of Motion putting the idea forward.</p>
      <p>He also spoke against changing the time from 9 a.m. to 7 a.m. pointing out, services at the Upper Room Mission and the Salvation Army begin at 9 a.m.</p>
      <p>“Where are these people suppose to go for a couple of hours?” Quiring said. “I'm not seeing it as a good idea.”</p>
      <p>Ultimately, both motions were quashed with Anderson the only vote in favour. Councillor's Akbal Mund and Kelly Fehr were absent from the meeting.</p>
