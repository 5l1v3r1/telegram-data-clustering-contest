      <h1>Looks Like Adam And Symon Have Ditched The ‘Gogglebox’ Couch For The ‘I’m A Celeb’ Jungle</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:20:18+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:20</time> by <a rel="author">By Josephine Rozenberg-Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Following in the footsteps of their fellow Goggleboxians <b>Angie Kent</b> and <b>Yvie Jones</b>, it certainly seems that <b>Adam Densten</b> and <b>Symon Lovett </b>might be donning the unflattering khaki shorts for a stint in the I’m A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here jungle.</p>
      <p>Yesterday came <a href="https://www.pedestrian.tv/entertainment/gogglebox-adam-symon-quit/">the sad news that the fan-favourite fancy sock-wearing duo wouldn’t be returning</a> for the next season of Gogglebox. But now rumours are swirling that the pair will be heading to South Africa as part of Ten’s jungle-based reality show, which premieres in January 2020. In fact, just yesterday arvo on Nova’s <a href="https://twitter.com/katetimmarty">Kate, Tim and Marty Show</a>, co-host <b>Tim Blackwell</b> stoked the gossip fires with this little nugget of information:</p>
      <blockquote>I heard something on Twitter, because I tweeted them last night to say “BOOO!” and I then got in my feed: “Enjoy the jungle.” ‘Cos as IF Channel Ten would get rid of two spunks like that.</blockquote>
      <p>I mean, he could be onto something — we’ve seen this happen before when Angie and Yvie went into the Jungle after resigning from their Gogglebox couch duties, with Angie of course even going on to be the Bachelorette this season.</p>

      <p>It seems Channel Ten likes to keep their talent on their books, which is why we also have thoughts, feelings and theories about Masked Singer MVP <b>Lindsay Lohan</b> plonking on the Akubra for an I’m A Celeb stint next season too. You can read that spicy hot take <a href="https://www.pedestrian.tv/film-tv/im-a-celebrity-clue-lindsay-lohan/"><b>HERE</b></a>.</p>
      <p>While it’s all well and good for us to sit here and speculate, we won’t actually find out who is set for Jungle exile until they are thrown out of a helicopter next year. Can’t bloody wait.</p>
