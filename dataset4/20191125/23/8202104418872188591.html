      <h3>RCMP have declared the fatal shooting of a 26-year-old man on the Lac La Ronge Indian Band a homicide.</h3>
      <p>An investigation <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/crime/one-dead-one-seriously-hurt-after-reports-of-shooting-in-air-ronge">continues into the circumstances leading to the death of Jeremy Bird</a>, RCMP said Monday in a news release. On Nov. 21 around 3:30 a.m., gunshots were fired into a camper occupied by five men, which was parked next to a home on Mikisiw Drive.</p>
      <p>Paramedics transferred two shooting victims to hospital, where Bird was pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>A second man was treated for what RCMP called “serious but non-life-threatening injuries.”</p>

      <p>An autopsy was conducted last week, RCMP said.</p>
      <p>The incident is not believed to be random. RCMP said investigators have been working alongside a forensics team from the Prince Albert city police, as well as members of the RCMP major crimes unit for northern Saskatchewan and a police canine unit out of North Battleford.</p>
      <p>Lac La Ronge Indian Band is located about 380 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon.</p>
      <p>RCMP investigators are seeking assistance from anyone who was in the area of Jonas Roberts Memorial Community Centre or Mikisiw Drive on the Lac La Ronge Indian Band between the night of Nov. 20 and the early morning of Nov. 21.</p>
