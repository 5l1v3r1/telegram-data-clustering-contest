      <p>Can Andy Ruiz Jr. prove he isn't the next James "Buster" Douglas?</p>
      <p>Ruiz (33-1, 22 KOs) gets the chance to show the boxing world <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/boxing/news/andy-ruiz-jr-upsets-anthony-joshua-twitter-reacts/1r23e7dev3qou1n2pbbjmouo6o">his monumental upset wasn't a fluke</a> in a rematch against Anthony Joshua for theIBF, WBA (super) and WBO heavyweight belts Ruiz claimed in their first fight. The sequelis set for Saturday, Dec. 7 from theDiriyah Arena in Diriyah, Saudi Arabia, <a href="http://bit.ly/2OseDeo">live and exclusively on DAZN</a>.</p>
      <p>Ruiz entered their first fight June 1as <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/boxing/news/andy-ruiz-underdog-betting-upset-win-anthony-joshua/18cytwid0qfzt17pep87s2zrte">a 9-1 underdog</a>. Except for those closest to him, no one gave Ruiz a prayer against Joshua, who had been regarded as the best heavyweight in the world. Then everything changed for the 30-year-old career challenger.</p>
      <p>Joshua (22-1, 21 KOs) appeared to have things well in control in the third round when he sent Ruiz to the canvas with a thudding left hook. Instead of wilting like those before him, Ruiz smiled, dusted himself off, and dropped Joshua with a left hand of his own. Near the end of the round, Ruiz sent Joshua to mat one time with a straight right hand.</p>

      <p>Then in <a href="https://www.dazn.com/en-US/news/boxing/anthony-joshua-vs-andy-ruiz-jr-results-highlights/ps7zbggv7clk1gpmk5rw3zbgn">the fateful seventh round</a>, Ruiz delivered the final blows and made history, knocking Joshua down two more times. After the final knockdown, referee Michael Griffin asked Joshua if he could continue. Joshua said he could but couldn't convince Griffin that he was serious and waved the bout off, and Ruiz became the first heavyweight champion of Mexican descent.</p>
      <p>When the dust settled, Joshua <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/boxing/news/anthony-joshua-rematch-andy-ruiz-jr/m5jf2hlvfr651jttxm2ojt2lg">didn't waste much time</a> to invoke the rematch clause in the contract. It was just a matter of securing a location for the biggest fight of 2019. Suitors from all over the world looked to host with Cardiff, Wales in Joshua's native England being the front runner. But at the last second, the kingdom of <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/boxing/news/anthony-joshua-andy-ruiz-jr-rematch-saudi-arabia-december/13rwfwp6cdr6y1gngey2hv1u47">Saudi Arabia swooped in and secured the bout</a>.</p>
