        <b>In spite of their relationship having ended in disaster, Callum ‘Halfway’ Highway (Tony Clay) has demonstrated that he still cares greatly for Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) in EastEnders. Similarly, Whitney has proven that she still loves Callum — and it appeared as if the pair may have embarked on a friendship had it not been for the evil Leo King’s (Tom Wells) interference.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, viewers will remember that, after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/29/eastenders-spoilers-whitney-dean-in-huge-danger-as-paedophile-tony-kings-son-leo-targets-her-10740335/">Leo set his sights on Whitney</a>, it didn’t take him long to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/18/eastenders-spoilers-callum-highway-in-danger-as-leo-king-targets-him-after-date-with-whitney-dean-ends-in-disaster-10941783/">realise that Callum was going to be something of a problem</a>. With Whitney still holding the young man in a high regard, it was nearly impossible for Leo to get close to her, and thus he set about getting Callum out of the picture.</p>
      <p>After acquiring an old video that didn’t paint Callum in a positive light, Leo <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/24/eastenders-spoilers-whitney-dean-devastated-as-evil-leo-king-reveals-callum-highways-secret-10976504/">showed the clip to Whitney</a>, who proceeded to publicly call him out. As a result, the young man’s heroic reputation was damaged, and thus Leo was able to swoop in and carry on with his plan.</p>

      <p>However, Leo ended up on the wrong side of the law several weeks back when Jack (Scott Maslen) was forced to arrest him, and in the coming episodes, the copper does some digging.</p>

      <p>Yes, Jack speaks to Callum about Leo — and the conversation clearly leaves him a little perturbed, as he wastes little time in seeking out Whitney in an attempt to warn her off the creepy paralegal.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Leo gets to her first, and explains everything.</p>
      <p>Will Jack and Callum be able to make Whitney see sense?</p>
      <p>While we’re not sure what exactly Callum said to Jack in order to raise his suspicions, the young man is clearly still hellbent on protecting Whitney, so perhaps him and Jack will be able to put an end to Leo’s manipulation?</p>
