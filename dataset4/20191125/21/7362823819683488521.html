      <h1>Chinese woman who trespassed at Mar-a-Lago facing prison time</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:12:12+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:12</time> by <a rel="author">Bradford Betz</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china">Chinese businesswoman</a> is facing prison time for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/chinese-woman-trial-mar-a-lago-witness-behavior">trespassing</a> at President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort and lying to federal agents.</p>
      <p>Yujing Zhang, a 33-year-old Shanghai consultant, was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/chinese-intruder-found-guilty-of-breaching-security-at-trumps-mar-a-lago-club">convicted in September</a> of trespassing at the Florida resort in March and lying to Secret Service agents who confronted her.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors have suggested Judge Roy Altman give Zhang 18 months in prison.</p>

      <p>Zhang had fraudulently gained entry onto the restricted Florida resort by telling a receptionist at the club and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/chinese-woman-trial-mar-a-lago-witness-behavior">Secret Service agents</a> that she was a member, taking photos ahead of a United Nations Chinese Friendship Association event – despite being repeatedly told that no such event was scheduled.</p>
      <p>When Zhang was arrested, she was carrying four cellphones, a computer and an external hard drive. Authorities later found nine flash drives, five cellphone SIM cards, a signal detector that could spot hidden cameras, and around $8,000 in cash in her Palm Beach hotel room.</p>

      <p>Her bizarre behavior and backstory led to suspicions that she was a spy for Beijing, but she was never charged with espionage or related crimes. Zhang’s text messages presented at trial suggested she was obsessed with the president.</p>

      <p>Zhang had <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/chinese-woman-to-represent-herself-in-mar-a-lago-case">acted as her own attorney</a> during her September trial and has not filed any documents regarding sentencing. She has no prior criminal record.</p>
