      <h1>Play on the Go With the Best Nintendo Switch Lite Cases</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:06:25+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/jminor/" target="_blank">Jordan Minor</a></address>
      <p>While the whole hook of the <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-nintendo-switch-1685280/">Nintendo Switch</a> is that you can either play it as a home console or powerful handheld, some players only treated it as a home console. They constantly leave it docked and enjoy the latest Nintendo games exclusively on a television. So players like that never needed to <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/10-best-cases-for-your-new-nintendo-switch-1767391/">get a Switch case</a>.</p>
      <p>However, the new and very cool <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/geek-pick-nintendo-switch-lite-feels-fake-in-a-good-way-1804898/">Nintendo Switch Lite</a> is only a powerful handheld. It’s only made for playing on the go. And while that means the design is a bit more durable compared to the original Switch, it also means that Nintendo Switch Lite owners definitely do need to get a case.</p>
      <p>Here are some of our picks for the best Nintendo Switch Lite cases.</p>

      <p>If you’re willing to wait a few extra weeks, you can get Nintendo’s own official Nintendo Switch Lite case. The Nintendo Switch Lite Flip Cover and Screen Protector ($40) is a thin case that doesn’t add much bulk to the slimmer device. It also includes a protective sheet for the all-important LCD screen.</p>

      <p>The durable, premium, community-designed bags from Waterfield are still my personal favorites for Nintendo Switch cases. The Slip Case for Nintendo Switch Lite ($60) brings that quality to the smaller handheld. This water-resistant pouch features a leather grip, plush interior, and magnetic closure. It fits the Switch Lite along with a handful of accessories. And it easily slots inside other Waterfield bags.</p>

      <p>The PowerA Stealth Case for Nintendo Switch Lite ($15) is a straightforward little case for the little machine. It has a screen protector, cleaning cloth, game card storage, and even a built-in kickstand for pseudo-tabletop mode. The Pokemon graffiti option is a nice touch.</p>

      <p>Just because the Switch Lite is small doesn’t need your case needs to be. The PDP Commuter Case ($30) can fit the full-size Switch or the Switch Lite and still have room for all sorts of accessories like controllers, the dock, the power adapter, and whatever other gear you need.</p>

      <p>Like we said part of the appeal of the Switch Lite is that it can take a tougher beating compared to the regular Switch. And if you want your Switch Lite pretty protected the Hori Slim Tough Pouch ($17) is an unobtrusive yet sturdy case.</p>
