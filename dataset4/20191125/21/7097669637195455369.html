      <h1>Kidnappers demand ransom for Frenchman: Mexico</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:31:20+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.afp.com/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Zinacantepec (Mexico) (AFP) - A French citizen and a Mexican actor kidnapped in a national park in central Mexico have been released, officials said Monday.</p>
      <p>The two men, identified as Frederic Michel and Alejandro Sandi, were traveling in all-terrain vehicles in the park around the Nevado de Toluca volcano on Sunday when they were ambushed and abducted, witnesses said.</p>
      <p>"Both the French and Mexican nationals have been released," a Mexican government official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case.</p>
      <p>Another source with Mexico's anti-kidnapping unit confirmed the release, also speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>The news came shortly after Mexican Security Minister Alfonso Durazo said the kidnappers had demanded a ransom.</p>
      <p>"There have been communications, and a ransom payment was, in effect, requested," Durazo told journalists.</p>
      <p>"We hope to have good news very soon."</p>
      <p>Police and National Guard troops had launched a search in the area around the snow-capped volcano in the park located about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of Mexico City that is popular with hikers and campers.</p>
      <p>Sandi is an actor who played a secondary role in the TV series "Lord of the Skies," a drama about drug traffickers broadcast by US-based Latin American network Telemundo.</p>
      <p>Two Mexican actresses traveling in the group said gunmen intercepted them and took their car by force, but let them go free.</p>
      <p>"We were on our way to visit the Nevado de Toluca when armed men blocked the road and took our car," actress and singer Esmeralda Ugalde said in a video posted on Twitter, speaking alongside fellow actress Vanessa Arias.</p>
      <p>Mexico has seen a significant increase in kidnappings this year: 1,700 from January to October, a rate of more than five per day -- a 38 percent increase on the same period last year.</p>
      <p>Leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December 2018, is struggling to rein in violent crime widely blamed on Mexico's drug cartels and other criminal gangs.</p>
      <p>This year appears on track to break Mexico's murder record, with 28,741 so far.</p>
