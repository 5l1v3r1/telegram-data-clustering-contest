      <p>HOLLYWOOD, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Los Angeles police shot a person armed with a machete during a confrontation Monday morning in Hollywood, leaving the suspect hospitalized and an officer injured, the LAPD said.<br/><br/>Video from the scene shows the officer chasing the suspect who was running down the street with a long machete. The officer can be heard shouting commands at the suspect, who then turns around and runs toward the officer with the weapon in his hand.<br/><br/>Several shots were fired by the officer as he backed away from the still-approaching suspect, causing the officer to run into the street and subsequently fall down. Just as the suspect reaches the officer on the ground, two additional officers arrive and one shoots the suspect.<br/><br/>Aerial video from AIR7 HD showed firefighter-paramedics placing an injured person on a gurney and into an ambulance about 11:45 a.m. near the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Highland Avenue.<br/><br/>A Los Angeles Fire Department spokesperson said the wounded suspect was transported to a medical center in unknown condition. A police officer who suffered injuries that were not life-threatening was being treated at the scene.</p>
