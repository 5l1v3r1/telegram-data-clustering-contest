      <h1>The Philadelphia Eagles Have Released A Veteran WR</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:28:06+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Wide receiver Jordan Matthews played much of the game for the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. On Monday, the team cut him.</p>
      <p>Matthews signed with Philly for a third stint earlier this month. He played in two games, making four receptions for 33 yards.</p>
      <p>The Eagles have had problems at the receiver position for much of the season, but Matthewsâ€™ release could signify that the Alshon Jeffery is close to returning. Jeffery has missed three games due to injury.</p>
      <p>Also, rookie J.J. Arcega-Whiteside may be poised to take on a larger role as well.</p>

      <p>The Eagles drafted Matthews out of Vanderbilt in 2014, and he played his first three seasons with the team. He played with the Buffalo Bills in 2017.</p>
      <p>Matthews also had a brief stint with the Eagles in 2018.</p>
