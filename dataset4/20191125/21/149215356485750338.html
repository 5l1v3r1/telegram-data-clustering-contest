        <b>Daniel Craig says he's done playing 007</b>
      </p>
      <p>Most 007 fans have already predicted that next year's<i> No Time to Die</i> will be Daniel Craig's final mission as James Bond, which is a fairly safe bet when an actor literally says he'd rather "slash my wrists" than make another one. But just in case any doubt remained, Craig himself has now flatly denied he'll play 007 again: "It's done," he said. And while that sounds fairly definitive, one of his fellow Bond actors might be quick to tell Craig that <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086006/">he should never say never again.</a> [<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/daniel-craig-confirms-hes-done-161404305.html"><i>Yahoo Entertainment</i></a><a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/film/daniel-craig-interview-my-advice-to-the-next-james-bond-dont-be-shit"><i>, TimeOut</i></a>]</p>

        <b>A <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> script ended up on eBay</b>
      </p>
      <p>There are few secrets Disney is guarding more closely than the plot of next month's <i>Rise of Skywalker</i>, which is poised to close out the third <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy. But if not for one eagle-eyed Disney employee, all of <i>Rise of Skywalker</i>'s secrets would have been made available to the highest bidder on the real-world equivalent of the Mos Eisley Cantina: eBay. Director J.J. Abrams revealed that a <i>Rise of Skywalker</i> script popped up on eBay after an unnamed actor left it lying under their bed, where it was swiped by a cleaning person and put up for auction. And while that might sound careless, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U3Oti2L8S4"><i>Star Wars</i> <i>does</i> have a history with important plans being smuggled out in the trash</a>.

        <b>Kanye West's opera started two hours late</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stop us if you've heard this one before, but Kanye West's latest grandiose project didn't exactly go off without a hitch. His new opera, <i>Nebuchadnezzer</i>, which premiered at the Hollywood Bowl on Sunday night, started more than two hours late. When the show finally began, it lasted for under an hour, with the title character delivering most of his dialogue as guttural screams — which, to be fair, probably echoed the audience's feelings by then.

        <b>Justin Bieber has pink hair now</b>
      </p>
      <p>Justin Bieber shot to fame as a Canadian adolescent with dulcet tones and a shaggy mop of hair. More than 10 years and one abandoned monkey later, it's safe to say Bieber has changed a bit— but perhaps no more radically than his brand-new hair, which has been dyed a bright neon pink. It remains to be seen if Beliebers end up cottoning to the new look, but drawing hair inspiration from actual cotton candy is surely a good first step.

        <b>Kim Kardashian has an M&amp;Ms hack that will 'change your life'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kim Kardashian has a very important message for you: You've been eating M&amp;Ms wrong. Kardashian recently took to social media to share her life-hack for enjoying M&amp;Ms — Heating them up in the microwave for 30 seconds, which means they'll be "melted on the inside and crunch on the outside." The same technique is favored by any toddler who has discovered the joy of squeezing M&amp;Ms in their fist (and despised by any parent who has been stuck cleaning up afterward).
