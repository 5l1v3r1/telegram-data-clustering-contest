      <h1>I'm A Celebrity's Ant and Dec take aim at fans over 'impossible' trial backlash</h1>
      <h2>I'm A Celebrity viewers hit out at the live trial on Sunday night, claiming the last challenge was 'impossible'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:29:38+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:29</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Tutton</a></address>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity campmates took part in the live trial on Sunday night, hoping to win a roast dinner for everyone.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Ian Wright, Cliff Parisi and Andy Whyment, they would not get their dinners because James Haskell and Roman Kemp failed the final challenge.</p>
      <p>Viewers fiercely defended the boys though, complaining that the last task was "impossible" to complete.</p>
      <p>They were also furious that Ian would not get his roast given how much he did in the live trial hosted by Ant and Dec.</p>
      <p>Ant and Dec have since denied the challenge wasn't possible, revealing stand-ins managed to complete it in time.</p>

      <p>But they didn't stop there, and the hosts decided to have one more dig at viewers complaining about the show.</p>
      <p>On Monday night, the pair introduced the next part of the task that would see Myles Stephenson, Nadine Coyle, Kate Garraway and Andy battle to win care packages.</p>
      <p>As Ant and Dec revealed what was coming up, they then began to mock the complaints from fans since the earlier trial.</p>

      <p>They mentioned the apparently "barely possible" task that was "difficult" to complete, before looking for the right word to describe it.</p>
      <p>The Mission Impossible movie theme tune began playing in the background, with then joking they still couldn't think of the term to define the task "unlikely" to be completed.</p>
      <p>It's then that Dec said: "It's impossible."</p>

      <p>Dec even blamed James' "sausage fingers" for not completing the trial, while not all of the fans watching at home saw the funny side.</p>
      <p>Responding to Ant and Dec's jibes, viewers continued to blast the trial and called for justice for the campmates.</p>
      <p>One fan said: "So pleased <a href="https://twitter.com/antanddec">@antanddec</a> can see the funny side of the live bushtucker trail, that was virtually impossible to complete. Laughing at someone’s else expense. Don’t rise to it <a href="https://twitter.com/IanWright0">@IanWright0</a> it’s what <a href="https://twitter.com/ITV">@ITV</a> want."</p>
      <p>Another tweeted: "Dec just saying 'I give up. It's impossible' has to be a reference to that unfair, impossible trial last night!"</p>
