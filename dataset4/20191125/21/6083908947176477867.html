      <h1>Harris Vows to 'Snatch' Patents From Drug Companies If They Don't Obey Her Orders</h1>

      <p>During a campaign stop in Iowa last week, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris promised the heavy hand of government when it comes to setting drug prices, vowing to “snatch” patents from private drug companies if they failed to do her will.</p>
      <p>“My plan, as a candidate for president, on these drug prices is as follows: We are going to set drug prices based on fair market,” she said Friday. “So, essentially what we’re going to do … is set drug prices so that American consumers are charged a price for drugs that’s the average price that’s being charged around the globe.”</p>
      <p>Harris pointed to the price difference for insulin as an example and argued that if companies don’t want to comply, she will go one step further.</p>
      <p>“A lot of drugs, prescription medication, was born out of the federal funding for the research and development of that drug. Your taxpayer dollars,” she said. “So, for any drug where they fail to play by our rules, and if that drug came about from federal funding for what’s called ‘R&amp;D,’ research and development, I will snatch their patent so that we will take over.”</p>

      <p>While Harris told the crowd her plan is legal, others, such as Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) and Trump Campaign Rapid Response Director Andrew Clark, informed her it is not.</p>
      <p>“Nope. Patents are unequivocally protected in the US Constitution,” Crenshaw wrote on Twitter. “Even if they weren’t, it doesn’t take a genius to understand that stealing people’s property after they make it means THEY WON’T MAKE IT ANYMORE. Fewer drugs, fewer cures. Bad policy.”</p>

      <p>Clark said her defense of this idea is “terrifying.”</p>
      <p>“A) No, actually, you cannot do that. B) Also, the government does not (and should not!) manufacture drugs. C) This is terrifying.”</p>
