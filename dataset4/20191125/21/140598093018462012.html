      <h1>Bill Cosby insists he will show no 'remorse' before parole board and calls his conviction a 'set-up'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:02:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/rozina-sabur/" target="_blank">Rozina Sabur</a></address>
      <p>Bill Cosby has insisted his<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/04/26/bill-cosby-found-guilty-sexual-assault-jury-philadelphia/"> sex assault conviction</a> was a "set-up" in his first interview from prison and insisted he will not show any "remorse" when he is eligible for parole.</p>
      <p>The disgraced comedian was last year jailed for between three and 10 years and branded a "sexually violent predator" for assaulting a woman at his mansion in Philadelphia 14 years ago.</p>
      <p>Legal experts say sex offenders typically must show remorse to be considered for parole, but in a defiant interview the 82-year-old Cosby maintained his innocence.</p>
      <p>“I have eight years and nine months left. When I come up for parole, they’re not going to hear me say that I have remorse," <a href="https://blackpressusa.com/nnpa-newswire-exclusive-bill-cosby-speaks-from-prison/">he told BlackPressUSA.com</a>.</p>
      <p>"I was there. I don’t care what group of people come along and talk about this when they weren’t there. They don’t know.”</p>
      <p>Cosby, once beloved as "America's Dad" for his role as Dr Cliff Huxtable in the 1980s sitcom "The Cosby Show," is currently appealing his conviction.</p>
      <p>In a lengthy interview published on Sunday, the former star dismissed his lengthy trial as a "political thing" and claimed it included biased jurors.</p>
      <p>“It’s all a set-up. That whole jury thing. They were impostors,” he said.</p>
      <p>He went on to describe his daily life in the Pennsylvania state prison he is housed in, referring to his cell as his “penthouse” and revealing he gives motivational talks to fellow inmates on Saturdays through a prison reform programme.</p>
      <p>“I’m looking at a state [Pennsylvania] that has a huge number of prisons, and the one I’m in, thankfully, has the largest population of African Americans,” Cosby said.</p>
      <p>“These are guys who are also from Philadelphia, where I grew up. Many of them are from the neighborhood," he said, adding: “I’m reaching them because they want to be reached. They’re in prison.”</p>
