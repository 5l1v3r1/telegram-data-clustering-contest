      <h2>It’s not just dogs and cats at the Aldergrove shelter</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/matthew-claxton/" target="_blank">Matthew Claxton</a></address>
      <p>The Patti Dale Animal Shelter in Aldergrove is home to more than 100 cats and dogs, kittens and puppies – and one more unusual resident right now.</p>
      <p>Flappy is a Muscovy duck who is up for adoption.</p>
      <p>Originally identified as a female, Flappy was renamed after white plumage appeared at his throat, a sign he’s most likely male. A young duck, he has not been claimed by an owner, but was found wandering as a stray animal.</p>
      <p>While the Langley Animal Protection Society mostly deals with domestic pets, the fact that Langley includes a large number of farms means the animal protection officers also have to pick up stray farm animals from time to time.</p>
      <p>LAPS members have cared for multiple pigs – most recently an 800-pound porker named Theodore, who was eventually adopted out to a farm sanctuary in Duncan last year – but also ordinary livestock such as horses, cattle, and sheep, and even the odd emu over the years.</p>

      <p>Most of the larger animals are reclaimed by their owners, or LAPS simply helps them round up the strays.</p>
      <p>LAPS is now looking for a farm-type location for Flappy to live out his days.</p>
