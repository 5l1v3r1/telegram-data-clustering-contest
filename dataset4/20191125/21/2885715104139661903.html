      <p>A Delhi court Monday granted bail to a 24-year-old Uzbekistan national who was arrested at IGI Airport for allegedly trying to smuggle 13 parrots to Tashkent.</p>
      <p>Anvarjon Rakhmat Jonov was arrested on October 15 by the customs department after they spotted the birds during scanning.</p>
      <p>The court was told one of the parrots flew away. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Purshotam Pathak observed that the accused has been in judicial custody since October 16 and his interrogation was not required.</p>
      <p>The CMM granted bail to Jonov on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh, subject to the condition that he join the probe and not tamper with evidence or influence witnesses.</p>
      <p>Jonovâ€™s counsel Karan Tarkar, who moved the bail plea, said he received the parrots from an Ukrainian man under the pretext of a gift.</p>
