      <h1>Man in China ordered to pay $13,000 to get his $1.4 million game avatar back</h1>
      <h2>All this after his friend tried extorting $55,000 out of him -- a real video-game soap opera</h2>

      <h4>WTF?! A man in China spent more than $1.4 million, developing his character in the Chinese MMORPG Justice Online. As if that in itself was not bizarre enough, the man’s friend sold the avatar to someone else for $552, and the original owner had to pay another $13,000 to get it back.</h4>
      <p>The story reads like some strange sitcom episode from an alternate reality. The South China Morning Post <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3038799/man-sues-netease-after-his-friend-sells-us14-million-game-character-us500">reports</a> the unnamed player “loaned” the character to his friend. The supposed “friend” (now former presumably) then tried to sell it back to him for 388,000 yuan ($55,138).</p>
      <p>When the original owner did not want to fork up the dough to get his avatar back, the buddy turned around and sold it on the game’s marketplace, hosted by <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/74044-pubg-corp-singles-out-netease-copyright-infringement.html">NetEase</a>, for 3,888 yuan ($552). He attributed the low price as a typo caused by a long session of gaming, but before he had time to retract the offer, someone has already snagged it.</p>
      <aside>"After the settlement, the local court in Sichuan posted on social media that the case was a great example of the protection of digital assets, and it warned gamers not to spend too much in video games."</aside>
      <p>Having heard of the sale, the original owner sued both his friend and NetEase. A Chinese judge mediated the bizarre case.</p>
      <p>In the final settlement, NetEase reversed the transaction and gave the owner back control of his character. However, the man had to pay the buyer 90,000 yuan ($12,789) in damages — more than 23 times what he purchased the character for on the marketplace. Of course, that is about a 77-percent discount off what his supposed friend tried to extort out of him.</p>
      <p>The lesson here is: if you have a digital asset that you care about, don’t lend it out, even to a friend. More importantly, don’t spend a million dollars on your game characters, people. You’re the reason <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/79999-proposed-senate-legislation-could-ban-pay-win-microtransactions.html">microtransactions</a> are out of control in the industry.</p>
