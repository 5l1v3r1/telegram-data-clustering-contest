      <h1>‘Woke’ American Music Awards Sets Record Low Viewership in Key Demo</h1>
      <h2>Audience getting tired of relentless progressive preaching.</h2>

        <b>Despite being rammed with ‘woke’ themes like gender politics and climate change, the American Music Awards hit a record low in viewership for the key demographic of 18-49 year-olds.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Reality TV star Big Freedia, who identifies as “gender-nonconforming,” gave a speech before his performance in front of a rainbow church set telling the audience, “Welcome to our Sunday Service,” which was an obvious dig at Kanye West’s Christian-themed gospel-filled church services.</p>
      <p>Camila Cabello also performed her song Living Proof alongside a group of male dancers wearing lace dresses.</p>
      <p>Taylor Swift, who has been hounded into adopting progressive themes in recent years, performed her track The Man, which laments sexism with the lyrics, “Cause if I was a man, then I’d be the man.”</p>
      <p>Billie Eilish also performed while wearing a black shirt emblazoned with the words, “No Music On a Dead Planet,” a reference to global warming.</p>
      <p>However, the promise of another heavy dose of progressive preaching wasn’t anticipated by the audience judging by viewership figures.</p>
      <p>“The 2019 AMAs posted a 1.7 rating/7 share among adults 18-49, down a bit from last year’s 1.8 rating — the awards show’s previous record low,” reports <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/amas-2019-ratings-record-low-american-music-awards-taylor-swift/">The Wrap</a>.</p>
      <p>This continues a trend over the last few years of awards shows consistently hitting record low viewership figures the more they embrace social justice themes.</p>
      <p>Get woke, go broke.</p>
