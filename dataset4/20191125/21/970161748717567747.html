      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> honored a hero dog injured in a raid that killed an infamous Isis leader with an invitation to the White House.</p>
      <p>The president surprised reporters at the White House rose garden on Monday by trotting out Conan, a Delta Force dog wounded during the operation that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/syria/">Syria</a> last month.</p>
      <p>Trump said: ‘We actually just gave Conan a medal and a plaque. I actually think Conan knew exactly what was going on. But a dog that is very, very special.’</p>
      <p>The president went on to call Conan a ‘tough cookie,’ a ‘hero’ and ‘the ultimate fighter, the ultimate everything.’</p>
      <p>Conan became a nameless celebrity shortly after the raid when Trump told the press: ‘Our K-9, as they call – I call it a dog, a beautiful dog, a talented dog – was injured and brought back.’ At that time, Conan’s name was still classified.</p>

      <p>Trump later declassified a picture of Conan, a Belgian Malinois, in a tweet, which was retweeted more than 130,000, becoming one of the president’s most popular tweets. Trump did not name Conan in the tweet, but later revealed his name.</p>

      <p>The president seemed jovial at Monday’s unscheduled appearance and even suggested Conan would turn on reporters who asked questions.</p>
      <p>‘It’s trained that if you open your mouths, you will be attacked. You want to be very, very careful,’ he said.</p>
      <p>Trump had previously said Conan was injured while chasing Baghdadi down a dead-end tunnel after it was feared the Isis leader was wearing a suicide vest, which he detonated, killing himself and three children.</p>
      <p>Conan was reportedly injured from an electrocution. He is now recovering.</p>

      <p>Trump was also set to sign a bipartisan bill, Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act, on Monday, which will officially make animal cruelty a felony charge.</p>
      <p>The bill was passed in the Senate on November 5 as an expansion on the 2010 Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act, which made the creating and distribution of ‘animal crushing’ videos illegal, which often fetishize women in high heels stepping on small animals and crushing them, according to Care Animal Rights.</p>
