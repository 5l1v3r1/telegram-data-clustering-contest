      <h1>Tekashi 6ix9ine’s Houston Assault Case Dismissed</h1>
      <h2>Prosecutors say that bringing 6ix9ine to Texas would present a “security risk” due to his federal cooperation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:35:05+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://pitchfork.com/staff/matthew-strauss/" target="_blank">Matthew Strauss, Braudie Blais-Billie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/6ix9ine/">Tekashi 6ix9ine</a> has had <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/6ix9ine-arrested-for-allegedly-choking-16-year-old/">a misdemeanor assault</a> case against him dropped, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/25/tekashi-6ix9ine-houston-mall-assault-case-dismissed/">TMZ</a> reports and Pitchfork can confirm via Harris County, Texas records. In his motion for dismissal, the Harris County Assistant District Attorney writes that “moving” 6ix9ine “is now a security risk,” due to <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/tekashi-6ix9ine-pleads-guilty-to-9-federal-crime-charges/">the rapper’s guilty plea</a> in <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/tekashi-6ix9ine-arrested-on-federal-crime-charges-report/">a federal racketeering case</a>, as well as his cooperation with the federal government and recent <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/tekashi-6ix9ine-testifies-at-trial-against-alleged-kidnapper-and-former-fellow-gang-members/">testimony against alleged gang members</a>.</p>
      <p>The misdemeanor assault case stems from a January 2018 incident in which 6ix9ine <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/6ix9ine-arrested-for-allegedly-choking-16-year-old/">allegedly choked a teenage boy</a> at the Galleria Mall in Houston, Texas. According to a police report, Hernandez and his security allegedly demanded that the teenager erase video footage of the incident from his phone. In October 2018, the teenager <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2018/10/19/tekashi69-alleged-mall-attack-victim-does-not-want-prosecuted-court-houston/">wrote a letter to the District Attorney’s office</a>, asking for the charges against 6ix9ine to be dropped.</p>
