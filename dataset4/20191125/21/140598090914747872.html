      <p>Police officers have been placed on “restricted duty” during a probe into handling of counterfeit goods, it has been revealed. </p>
      <p>A total of twenty-two officers from Greater Manchester Police have been placed on restricted duties following a "serious allegation". </p>
      <p>An inquiry is being carried out by the force's Professional Standards Branch.</p>
      <p>The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said that they were alerted after the matter was reported on 15 November of this year. </p>
      <p>Greater Manchester Police (GMP) would not provide any further details about the nature of the allegation but said that the officers would remain on restricted duties while the investigation is being carried out. </p>
      <p>Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts said: "The public rightly expects the highest standards from our officers and as such it is appropriate that we conduct a thorough and robust investigation into the serious concerns raised."</p>
      <p>An IOPC spokesperson said: "We received a referral from GMP in relation to an allegation involving the handling of counterfeit goods by officers.</p>
      <p>"We have assessed the information we have so far and have decided that this should be locally investigated."</p>
      <p>The probe is believed to centre on the Cheetham Hill are, according to the Manchester Evening News. </p>
      <p>The district is currently receiving high profile policing due to a gun war between two crime gangs.</p>
      <p>Since September, there have been six incidents involving the two groups including five  shootings a fight that included machetes. </p>
      <p>Four people have been arrested in connection with that inquiry - three on suspicion of robbery and one in connection with a shooting in Spender Avenue.</p>
      <p>Last week Greater Manchester Mayor, Andy Burnham visited Cheetham Hill and said that those causing fear in the community "will not win".</p>
      <p>Supt Rebecca Boyce told Manchester Evening News: "There has been concern amongst local business owners. We do not have any specific information to say they are at risk.</p>
      <p>"This is between crime groups, there is no information of a wider threat to the community."</p>
