      <p>The Toronto Blue Jays announced the trade of right-handed reliever Justin Shafer to the Cincinnati Reds on Monday.</p>
      <p>Shafer, 27, made 34 appearances for the team in 2019, going 2-1 with an earned run average of 3.86 and a WHIP of 1.664 over 39.2 innings pitched.</p>
      <p>A native of Lake Wales, FL, Shafer was taken by the Jays in the eighth round of the 2014 draft out of Florida. He made his MLB debut in 2018.</p>
      <p>Shafer had been designated for assignment last weekÂ  and Tim Mayza was outrighted to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons in order to make room on the 40-man roster for shortstop Santiago Espinal and right-handed pitcher Thomas Hatch.</p>
