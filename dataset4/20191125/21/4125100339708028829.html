      <p>The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) chapter of National Association of Resident Doctors (NARDs), on Monday, observed that there is an increasing number of persons with mental health issues in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Dr Roland Aigbovo, the Chairman of the Abuja chapter, made this observation at a news conference to herald the association’s 2019 Annual Health Week and General Meeting/Scientific Conference in Abuja.</p>
      <p>News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the theme of the 2019 Annual Health Week is: “Neglect of Mental Health: A Threat to the Society”.</p>
      <p>Aigbovo said there was the need to address mental health issues in the country.</p>
      <p>He explained that the mental health situation was further worsened by non-availability of medicines, absence of mental health services at the primary healthcare level and other services.</p>
      <p>He listed other services to include: counselling, housing and support groups, which he said were also lacking.</p>

      <p>He said that the mental health issue required immediate action, noting that with the recent suicidal episodes in the country, it behoved on the citizenry to have a rethink on their general attitude to the menace.</p>
      <p>Aigbovo said that the sub-themes for the conference included current management of clinical depression, physicians’ burnout and its implication on healthcare delivery.</p>
      <p>He said “we also want to draw the attention of both government and the public to another important but hugely ignored aspect of healthcare services, which is physicians’ burnout.</p>
      <p>“Our duties as physicians put us at risk of varying health challenges ranging from hypertension, anxiety, psychosis, drug and substance abuse and ultimately suicide.</p>

      <p>“We are made to attend to varying number of patients on a daily basis and work for over 24 hours straight in many instances.”</p>
      <p>He noted that this had direct consequence on the quality of services rendered and made members prone to avoidable mistakes.</p>
      <p>He said burnout could directly be linked to undesirable consequences like higher medical errors, malpractice risk, and higher physician and staff turnover.</p>
      <p>The chairman added that increased mental disorders was another undesirable consequence.</p>
