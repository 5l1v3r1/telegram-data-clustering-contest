      <h2>WARNING: DISTRESSING CONTENT Crew members desperately hurled life rings into the water after terrified migrants and refugees, said to be from Libya, became in trouble off the coast of Lampedusa, an Italian island south of Sicily</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:18:56+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:18</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>A young girl was miraculously pulled from choppy waters after her boat full of refugees capsized, killing seven people.</p>
      <p>The youngster was one of many children, including babies, retrieved by heroic scuba divers off the coast of Italy on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The group of around 150 people were attempting to migrate to Europe from Libya, it's understood.</p>
      <p>The bodycam footage shows several struggling in the water.</p>
      <p>"Here give me your baby," one brave person is heard saying amid the huge rescue operation.</p>
      <p>But sadly, seven migrants, five of them women, died and others are missing.</p>
      <p>It is believed the boat sank in the choppy and stormy conditions.</p>

      <p>And the rough <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> has also hampered the search for those missing.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, 73 migrants onboard a struggling boat were rescued off the coast of Spain. They too were believed to have left Libya on Africa's north coast.</p>
      <p>Some of the migrants were reportedly in shock and had "second to third-degree burns, gunshot wounds".</p>
      <p>And more than 120 people were taken onboard the Ocean Viking, a rescue vessel operated by SOS Méditerranée and Doctors Without Borders, earlier last week.</p>

      <p>Back in the UK, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/desperate-migrants-struggling-breathe-rescued-20952199">desperate migrants struggling to breathe were rescued from the back of a lorry</a> on the M25 on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Police said 10 migrants were found in the back after it had pulled over on the motorway in Essex.</p>
      <p>Witnesses saw one man coughing while lying on the ground next to the lorry and another  staggering from the container.</p>
      <p>Essex Police said 10 migrants, all males, were held on immigration offences and the Polish driver arrested.</p>
      <p>It is the latest example of traffickers ruthlessly cashing in on the dreams of migrants desperate to reach the UK.</p>
