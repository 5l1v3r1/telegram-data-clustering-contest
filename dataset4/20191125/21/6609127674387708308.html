      <p>The victim, 58, needed life-saving surgery after the horror attack in central Aberdeen.</p>
      <p>During sentencing at the city’s sheriff court, Low asked: “Am I allowed to write a letter of apology to that man, or can I go and say sorry to him at least?”</p>
      <p>Law chief Andrew Miller suggested she send a note for the procurator fiscal to pass on.</p>
      <p>Low, of the city’s Ferryhill, shouted “Thanks for being nice” as she left court.</p>
      <p>She had admitted assault to severe injury, permanent impairment and danger of life.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The man had part of his skull removed and fluid drained from his brain after December’s shove.</p>
      <p>Low claimed he had made a “proposition”.</p>
      <p>She told the court: “He said I was a prostitute.”</p>
