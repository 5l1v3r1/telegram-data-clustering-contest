      <p>A man has been charged in connection with the shooting death of another man in southwest Oklahoma City then fleeing to Texas.</p>
      <p>Raul Santiago Herrejon, 24, was charged with first-degree murder, after authorities said he shot Reynaldo Rivas, 29, in the left side of his head at 3340 SW 24 at around 1:15 p.m. on Oct. 16.</p>
      <p>When officers arrived at the scene, they found Rivas covered in blood on the floor of a bedroom, according to a probable cause affidavit. Officers said they discovered what appeared to be a meth pipe next to Rivas on the floor.</p>
      <p>Rivas was taken to OU Medical Center in critical condition and later died from his injuries.</p>
      <p>Around 8:20 p.m. the same day, Oklahoma City investigators were contacted by authorities in Carson County, Texas. The Texas authorities had stopped a white Ford Explorer driven by Herrejon. He was arrested for not having a state driver’s license, according to the affidavit.</p>
      <p>During a search of his vehicle, authorities said they found two handguns and a wallet that belonged to a man named Julian Machado, who lived at the Oklahoma City residence where the shooting occurred earlier that day.</p>
      <p>Authorities said Herrejon admitted to being at the residence, getting into an altercation with Rivas and shooting him.</p>
      <p>Herrejon told authorities he fled the residence with two guns, got into a truck belonging to the homeowner, drove to his mother’s place of work, parked the truck then got into his mother’s white Ford Explorer to flee Oklahoma City, according to the probable cause affidavit.</p>
      <p>A day later, Machado, whose wallet was allegedly stolen, told investigators that he and Herrejon were together with victim Reynaldo at the residence the day before. According to the affidavit, Machado said he was sweeping the floor outside his bedroom when he heard a gunshot wound inside his bedroom.</p>
      <p>Through the doorway, he saw Rivas fall from the bed to the floor, the affidavit says.</p>
      <p>Machado told authorities he ran and hid behind his mother’s bed, but Herrejon entered the room, pointed a revolver at him and asked for his keys.</p>
      <p>Machado said he handed Herrejon the keys to his truck. He told investigators he had been hiding for fear of his life.</p>
      <p>As of Monday afternoon, Herrejon was being held in the Oklahoma County jail. He is also charged with felony robbery with a firearm.</p>
