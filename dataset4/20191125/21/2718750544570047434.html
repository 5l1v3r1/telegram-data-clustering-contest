      <h1>Lin-Manuel Miranda’s <i>His Dark Materials </i>Mustache Was His Idea</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:49:45+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:49</time> by <a rel="author">Benjamin Lindsay</a></address>
      <p>Lin-Manuel Miranda knows he looks rather dashing on <a href="https://www.vulture.com/tv/his-dark-materials/"><i>His Dark Materials</i></a>. Making his big debut on tonight’s fourth episode as the novels’ Texan aeronaut Lee Scoresby, Miranda is given a mile-high hero’s entrance, gets caught up in a bar fight, and rekindles his friendship with an old armored bear — all in a day’s work!</p>
      <p>After an advance screening of the episode in Manhattan last week, Miranda emphasized that he wanted his look to capture all that yeehaw energy, starting with the ’stache. </p>
      <p>“I pitched the mustache because I like the idea of sort of a Clark Gable-y way in,” Miranda said, humorously adding, “It’s sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantinflas">Cantinflas </a>on my face. It’s trying for the Clark Gable and failing. And then as soon as I saw the costume and what [designer Caroline McCall] was going for, that was 90 percent of Lee, the badassery he wears.”</p>
      <p>The rest of his character-building came from a variety of places. First stop was <i>Once Upon a Time in the North</i>, author <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/philip-pullman">Philip Pullman</a>’s prequel novella about the friendship between Lee and Iorick the bear. While Miranda’s long been a die-hard fan of the fantasy trilogy, reading the prequel was instructive in that it “shows us a scrappier, younger Lee, which is the Lee that we brought to this series,” he said. Then, doing his best to avoid a Sam Elliott imitation from the 2007 feature film <i>The Golden Compass</i> (“I’d be doomed”), he drew on his own personal inspirations.</p>
      <p>“I thought about my grandfather a lot, actually,” Miranda explained. “My grandfather was a big Westerns guy and he always had a dime-store Western in his pocket. My last great memory with him was watching the <i>Deadwood </i>series, which we sort of both really keyed in on, but he saw every episode of <i>Gunsmoke</i>, he saw every John Wayne movie. So I was just channeling the best of Gary Cooper and trying to grab all the best things.”</p>
      <p>Better yet, his debut episode features a Western must-have: “I love that my first scene, which was my second day at work, was walking into the bar, saying the wrong name, and getting into a fight. That is <i>that </i>scene from every Western.”</p>
      <p>Comparing the character to Han Solo of <i>Star Wars</i>, Miranda added that it’s ultimately Lyra, as played by <i>Logan </i>breakout Dafne Keen, who begins to give his pickpocketing cowboy’s life meaning.</p>
      <p>“Han Solo is just this badass loner scoundrel until he finds something bigger than himself and believes in it, and I think the same is true of Lee Scoresby. Lee Scoresby is fuckin’ picking pockets until he meets Lyra. There’s this instant kinship.” </p>
      <p>Instant kinship was also had off-camera. Miranda said that he and the 14-year-old Keen — who’s half-Spanish, born to two actors, and herself a lover of <i>Hamilton </i>— were bonding over musical theater in no time.</p>
      <p>“It was a lot of Dafne and I speaking in fluent Spanish to each other so the crew couldn’t understand us, and it was a lot of show tunes,” Miranda said. “It was [an] instant connection and inside jokes.” Unsurprisingly, a similar rapport was built on the <i>Logan </i>set with Keen and Hugh Jackman. “She’s like, ‘On my last movie, I just sang with Hugh Jackman all the time!’ I was like, ‘Great, we can do that! I know show tunes!’ So a lot of show tunes and, like, Spanish. But we connected very quickly. She’s just so precocious and great.”</p>
