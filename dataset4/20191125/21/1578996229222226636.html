      <p>Riley Keough and Camila Morrone are taking center stage. The two are set to co-star in <i>Daisy Jones &amp; the Six</i>, based on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daisy-Jones-Taylor-Jenkins-Reid/dp/1524798622">the book by Taylor Jenkins Reid</a>. The musical limited series will follow the title rockstar (Keogh) as she achieves stardom in 1970s L.A. Reese Witherspoon will executive produce.</p>
      <p>Here's what you need to know about the upcoming project.</p>
      <h3>What's it about?</h3>
      <p><i>Daisy and the Six </i>is based on the 2019 novel of the same name, which was previously a pick for <a href="https://hello-sunshine.com/post/reeses-book-club-all-picks">Witherspoon's Book Club</a>. Written by Taylor Jenkins Reid, who will also produce the series, the book follows the rise and fall of a renowned rock band in the 1970s. Keough will play lead singer Jones, who is described as someone "born into privilege but ignored by her selfish parents. She is a spirited and enigmatic singer/songwriter who comes of age and rises to rock superstardom against the backdrop of the L.A. music scene in the 1970s," <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/riley-keough-amazon-daisy-jones-and-the-six-niki-caro-1203408192/">per </a><i><a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/riley-keough-amazon-daisy-jones-and-the-six-niki-caro-1203408192/">Variety</a></i>. Original music from the series will also be available through Amazon Music, according to <i><a href="https://www.thewrap.com/riley-keough-cast-as-lead-in-amazons-daisy-jones-and-the-six-niki-caro-to-direct/">The Wrap</a>.</i></p>
      <p>"I’m so honored to be your Daisy," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5Bj9atliIO/">Keough wrote on Instagram</a> when her casting was announced.</p>
      <h3>Who is involved?</h3>
      <p>Keough will lead the series as Jones, and has plenty of experience to draw on for the role.

Keough also has a unique family tie; she's the eldest grandchild of Elvis and Priscilla Presley.</p>
