      <p>J.J. Abrams has revealed that the script for the upcoming <i><a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/star-wars">Star Wars</a> </i>film was leaked online after a cast member left a copy of it “under their bed.”</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The <i>Star Wars </i>director explained on <i>Good Morning America</i> that the script for the upcoming film was posted on E-bay after it was discovered by a cleaner at one of the actor’s  houses.</p>
      <p>Whilst Abrams wouldn’t reveal who the actor was, he did note that a <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/disney">Disney</a> employee spotted the script online and “got it back before it sold.”</p>
      <p>Abrams said: “One of our actors, I won’t say which one — I want to, but I won’t — left it under their bed and it was found by someone who was cleaning their place,” Abrams told <i>Good Morning America.</i>  He added: “And it was given to someone else, who then went to sell it on eBay.”</p>
      <p>The director also explained that the film, which is due to arrive in cinemas next month, was still being worked on as late as last week and was only completed last Sunday (November 23). You can watch the interview here:</p>
