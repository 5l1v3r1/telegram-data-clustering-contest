      <h3>Bitcoin could spend months trading at $5,500</h3>
      <p>Commodities trader and technician Peter Brandt recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-may-hit-55k-in-2020-to-wear-out-bulls-peter-brandt">revealed</a> his belief that BTC could spend months trading at $5,500 before it recovers. The veteran trader became best known as being one of the first analysts who accurately predicted the end of the bull run in December 2017. </p>
      <p>“My target of $5,500 is not far below today's low. But I think the surprise might be in the duration and nature of the market,” he wrote. Brandt continued: </p>
      <blockquote>“I am thinking about a low in July 2020. That will wear out bulls quicker than a price correction.”</blockquote>
      <p>Well-known statistician and analyst Willy Woo, together with crypto trader Tone Vays, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-hit-4-500-but-miners-have-mostly-capitulated-analysts">echoed</a> similar sentiments when they said that the threat still remains that Bitcoin will hit $4,500. </p>
      <p>Regular Cointelegraph contributor Filb Filb added his opinion to the mix of negative sentiments, saying that for him now was a time to be risk-off:</p>
      <blockquote>“I’m totally back in cash now. There doesn’t seem to be obvious sign of reversal. Going to sit on the sidelines until there is more indication.”</blockquote>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), meanwhile, saw a painful drop in sync with BTC during recent days. The number-one altcoin bounced of its daily low at $134, before moving up to its current trading price of $147 per coin. Ether is showing a mild gain of around 0.7% on the day.</p>
