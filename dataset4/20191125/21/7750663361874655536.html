      <p>Saturday's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/west-ham-united-vs-spurs_game_92634.html">3-2 reverse against Tottenham Hotspur</a> was the Hammers' fifth defeat in their last seven league games and a result that drops them to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">16th in the table</a>, just three points above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> reports that while the club's hierarchy want to support the 66-year-old, who they backed extensively in the transfer market, they are concerned that he is not grasping the severity of the situation that they currently find themselves in.</p>
      <p>As such, the club have called him in for serious talks, outlining their absolute desire to avoid a relegation battle in the second half of the season.</p>
      <p>It is believed that their upcoming three games against Chelsea, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Arsenal could be decisive in determining the Chilean's fate.</p>
