      <p>Derby County Under-23s' impressive run was ended by a 4-1 defeat to Leicester City on Monday night.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Rams</a> had gone unbeaten in Premier League Two Division One since their opening day loss to Chelsea.</p>
      <p>That run of nine league games without defeat has seen them climb to second in the table.</p>
      <p>They had also been making good progress in the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/senior-derby-county-quartet-feature-3535901">cup competitions</a> - but came up against a Leicester side also in good form.</p>

      <p>All the goals came in a dramatic first half at Holmes Park as the fourth-placed Foxes made it six wins out of six in all competitions.</p>
      <p>The hosts took charge as they raced into a three-goal lead inside the opening half-hour.</p>
      <p>George Hirst set City on their way early on, putting them ahead in the ninth minute.</p>
      <p>Josh Eppiah doubled their advantage in the 26th minute, before Admiral Muskwe added a third soon afterwards.</p>
      <p>Jahmal Hector-Ingram pulled one back for <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby</a> in the 37th minute - but Leicester soon restored their three-goal cushion.</p>
      <p>It was captain George Thomas who made it 4-1 four minutes before the break - and that proved to be the end of the scoring.</p>
      <p><b>LEICESTER CITY:</b> Johansson, Clark (Daley-Campbell, 79), Johnson, Ughelumba, L Thomas, G Thomas, Dewsbury-Hall, Eppiah, Muskwe (Reghba, 71), Wright (Lesshabela, 62), Hirst. Other subs: Davies (gk), Tee.</p>
