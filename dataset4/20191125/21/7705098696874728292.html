      <h1>Crisis on Infinite Earths Episode 3 Pics Gather the Heroes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:41:36+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:41</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Abbate</a></address>
      <p>The Waverider is about to get a lot more crowded than usual. Via <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/25/the-flash-crisis-on-infinite-earths-crossover-photos/?utm_term=2CCC99D8-0FB7-11EA-A323-7ACE4744363C&amp;utm_campaign=entertainmentweekly_ew&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_content=link">Entertainment Weekly</a>, The CW has just released more than 20 new photos from the third installment of <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths"><b>Crisis on Infinite Earths</b></a>. It looks like the <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/arrowverse"><b>Arrowverse</b></a>’s many heroes (and one villain) will spend a good deal of the episode onboard the <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/legends-of-tomorrow"><b>Legends of Tomorrow</b></a>’s primary mode of transportation.</p>
      <p>Hour 3 of <b>Crisis</b> will air as an episode of <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-flash"><b>The Flash</b></a> on Tuesday, December 10. This chapter will formally bring Cress Williams’ <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/black-lightning"><b>Black Lighting</b></a> into the <b>Arrowverse</b>. Williams’ character is prominently featured in a lot of these new images. According to the episode’s synopsis, Pariah (Tom Cavanagh) is the one who drafts him into the fight against the Anti-Monitor.</p>

      <p>In one shot, Black Lightning is shaking hands with John Wesley Shipp’s Barry Allen/The Flash from Earth-90. Shipp briefly reprised his starring role from the 1990 <b>Flash</b> TV series during the <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/elseworlds"><b>Elseworlds</b></a> crossover last year. This Flash probably won’t be excited to see the Monitor after he ravaged his dimension using the Book of Destiny. But apparently, what he learned from his ordeal could be crucial to saving the multiverse.</p>
      <p>Additionally, The CW has treated fans to new stills featuring Grant Gustin’s Flash, Green Arrow, Batwoman, and Supergirl. Carlos Valdes also makes an appearance as Cisco Ramon, confirming that he’ll once again become Vibe after giving up his powers in <b>The Flash</b>’s season 5 finale. However, even more noteworthy is the appearance of Jon Cryer as Lex Luthor. Whatever his intentions are, Ruby Rose’s Batwoman clearly isn’t having any of it.</p>
