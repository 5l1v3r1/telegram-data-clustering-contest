      <p>In an interview on <i>Channel 1</i> (Egypt), retired Egyptian General Fouad Fayoud suggested that Muslim Brotherhood founder Hassan Al-Banna had been a Jew because he had lived in a neighborhood inhabited by Moroccan Jews and had been known as “the watchmaker,” a profession that General Fayoud said had been practiced exclusively by Jews at the time, reports the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI).</p>
      <p>In addition, General Fayoud claimed that the Mossad has had agents trying to wreak havoc in Egypt and that Israel aims to tear apart Arab countries such as Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq by causing sectarian conflict.</p>
