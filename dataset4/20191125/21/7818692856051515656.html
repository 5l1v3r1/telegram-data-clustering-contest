      <h1>More changes at ABC30 Actions News. This time, it’s at the weather desk</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:39:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:39</time> by <a rel="author">Joshua Tehee and</a></address>
      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://abc30.com/">ABC30 Action News</a> will have noticed more on-air changes over the past few weeks.</p>
      <p>It appears that meteorologist Reuben Contreras has left the station and Madeline Evans has joined the team to do weekday morning and midday weather.</p>
      <p>While the station said that it does not comment on personnel matters, Contreras is not listed as <a href="https://abc30.com/about/newsteam/">a member of the news team</a>, according to the ABC30.com website. Contreras’ ABC30 Twitter and Facebook pages have also been removed from the social media sites.</p>
      <p>Evans announced her new gig on social media earlier this month with a picture post of herself <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4vcSNQBP3J/">standing in front of the ABC30 news desk</a>. In the caption she wrote: “You can’t always wait for the perfect time. Sometimes, you have to dare to do it because life is too short to wonder what could have been. Today I started a new freelance gig at @abc30_actionnews as the weekday morning/midday meteorologist!”</p>
      <p>Evans isn’t new to the Fresno TV market. She has done fill-in work as a meteorologist on KSEE24 and CBS47, and also has been seen as a host on <a href="https://www.yourcentralvalley.com/central-valley-today/">Central Valley Today</a>.</p>
      <p>Contreras<a href="https://tvcontract.com/clients/1410"> had been with ABC30 since 2004</a> working in a variety of positions, including associate producer of Action News AM Live, for which he won a regional Emmy in 2012.</p>
      <p>This is the latest change at ABC30. The station already has seen the departures of four newscasters this year – <a href="https://www.fresnobee.com/entertainment/tv/article236420838.html">Tony Cabrera</a>, <a href="https://www.fresnobee.com/entertainment/ent-columns-blogs/fresno-beehive/article234411877.html">Brianna Ruffalo</a>, <a href="https://www.fresnobee.com/entertainment/ent-columns-blogs/fresno-beehive/article234266502.html">Chris Alvarez</a> and Gene Haagenson.</p>
      <p>Cabrera and Ruffalo took jobs with the ABC affiliate in Los Angeles; Alvarez works for ABC7 in the Bay Area.</p>
      <p>Haagenson retired after almost 30 years to “<a href="https://www.fresnobee.com/entertainment/ent-columns-blogs/fresno-beehive/article232181647.html">spend more time with the grandkids</a>.”</p>
