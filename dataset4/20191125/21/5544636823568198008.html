      <p>Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has faulted the death penalty being proposed for offenders of hate speech in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Concise News understands that the Protection from Internet Falsehoods and Manipulations Bill, also known as anti-social media bill has passed its second reading in the Senate.</p>
      <p>The bill proposes a death penalty for hate speech offenders but Akeredolu has faulted the move describing it as using a sledgehammer to kill an ant.</p>
      <p>He spoke on Monday in Ilorin, Kwara State at the opening ceremony of the sixth biennial international conference of the University of Ilorin Centre for Peace and Strategic Studies department.</p>
      <p>“How can somebody steal N10,000 and be sentenced to death, when another person who stole or embezzled N1m is allowed to go scot-free,” he asked.</p>
      <p>“When I was the president of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), I vehemently opposed capital punishment for condemned criminals. I will be a turncoat as governor to now support the death penalty for hate-speech offenders.”</p>
      <p>According to him, “As the governor of Ondo state, I will not commit to death those condemned criminals; instead, I will look into how to commute their sentences to life imprisonment. Or I will transfer them to other administrations.”</p>
      <p>The Ondo State leader lamented that there is no strong opposition in Nigeria, saying “every other person who was in opposition in 2015 has now crossed over to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). I am amused if I see them decamping in droves to the APC.”</p>
      <p>He further noted that injustice has caused conflicts in Nigeria, adding that many Nigerians depend on handouts from politicians to survive.</p>
      <p>The governor said: “Any discussion on justice which leaves out the deplorable conditions of the people is self-serving; it is patently unjust to have the mass of the people depend on handouts from the political class having lost the capacity to contribute to the development of the polity.</p>
      <p>“Until and unless the identifiable geo-political zones are encouraged to realize their potentials with a view to participating actively in the economic activities for growth and prosperity, there will be no end to crises.”</p>
