      <h1>Federal Court approves $900M deal to settle military sexual-assault cases</h1>

      <p>OTTAWA -- The Federal Court has approved a $900-million agreement that will settle multiple class-action lawsuits by survivors of sexual harassment and assault in the military.</p>
      <p>The federal government agreed in July to pay $800 million for members of the Canadian Armed Forces and $100 million for another class of employees of the Department of National Defence to settle six overlapping cases filed in recent years.</p>
      <p>The lawsuits made claims about sexual harassment, gender discrimination and sexual assault.</p>
      <p>The Liberals began by fighting the lawsuits in late 2017, but reversed course weeks later in early 2018 to begin settlement talks.</p>
      <p>The judgment released Monday afternoon says most, but not all, of the members of the classes in the lawsuits wanted the deal approved by the court.</p>
      <p>Judge Simon Fothergill, in his ruling, agreed the settlement should be approved, but wrote that such a deal is "inevitably a compromise" that is "unlikely to give all parties precisely what they want."</p>
      <p>In July when the settlement was announced, lawsuit members were told they would be eligible for between $5,000 and $55,000.</p>
      <p>A further $100,000 each could go to people subjected to exceptional harm, such as those who suffered post-traumatic stress disorder from the way they were treated and were denied benefits for the related disability.</p>
      <p>The settlement also calls for an external review of existing anti-harassment programs and revisions to how the government deals with disability benefits for survivors of sexual assault or harassment.</p>
