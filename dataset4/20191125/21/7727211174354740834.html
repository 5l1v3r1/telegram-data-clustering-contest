      <h1>Dismissing the ridiculous fears over Liverpool's recent clean sheet record</h1>
      <h2>LFC Stories: No clean sheet for Alisson Becker this season, but no need to panic</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:57:20+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:57</time> by <a rel="author">Sam McGuire</a></address>
      <p>There is a misconception that clean sheets are the sign of a solid defence. In fact, in many ways, they’re something of a false currency. Man-of-the-match goalkeeping performances, poor showings in front of goal by opposition players, and general bad luck when in the penalty area can all result in a clean sheet.</p>
      <p>In isolation, these factors are taken into account. But on the whole, the argument is that the more clean sheets a team has, the better they are defensively. To an extent, this is true. But like with all statistics, context is very much necessary.</p>
      <p>The narrative so far this term is that Liverpool haven’t been as good defensively as they were last term. The Reds have managed a shut out in just two of the 13 matches they’ve played in the Premier League so far and they’ve conceded 11 times. For comparison, at this stage last year, Jurgen Klopp’s side had eight clean sheets to their name and they’d been breached on just the five occasions.</p>
      <p>On paper, it’s quite the drop-off and would normally be cause for concern. The Premier League leaders have conceded five more goals and kept six fewer clean sheets. But in reality, Liverpool still have one of the meanest defences in the English top-flight.</p>
      <p>It’s only when looking at expected goals against that you get the full picture. During their record-breaking 2018/19 season, the Reds had an expected goals against (xGA) total of 29.15 - over seven more than what they actually conceded (22). When breaking this down to a per 90-minute basis, Liverpool conceded 0.57 goals, with an xGA average of 0.76.</p>
      <p>Michael Edwards and the recruitment team on Merseyside spent big money on Alisson Becker for this very reason. With the Reds rarely conceding chances, the former Roma shot-stopper was there to ensure any slight breach of their backline wasn’t costly. He did just that and then some; that’s why, per 90, Liverpool outperformed their xGA metric by 0.19.</p>
      <p>This year, however, it’s been a little different. With the Brazil No.1 out injured, Adrian kept goal for the Reds. He did an admirable job but he isn’t in the same league as his team-mate. Very few are.</p>
      <p>In three of the seven matches he started, Liverpool significantly underperformed their xGA metric. After a year of Alisson, it’s difficult to not feel as though he wouldn’t have saved some of the goals conceded by Adrian.</p>
      <p>And this is evident in the stats, too.</p>
      <p>As previously mentioned, the Reds have conceded 11 goals. Their xGA total is 10.35. On a per 90 basis, this is 0.84 goals against with a 0.79 xGA average.</p>
      <p>In terms of the underlying numbers, there’s a minimal difference. But then when looking at actual goals conceded, the difference is 0.27 which, over the course of a season, is a 10-goal swing.</p>
      <p>The value of a world-class goalkeeper is further backed up when looking at post-shot xGA. This stat takes into account where the shot was taken from and where the effort lands on target. The purpose of it is to show which players add to their chances with precise finishing, but it can be used to show which keepers are effectively making saves they have no right to be making.</p>
      <p>For context, during the 2018/19 campaign, the post-shot xGA average was 0.72; a reminder that Liverpool conceded just 0.57 per 90. With Adrian between the sticks, Liverpool’s post-shot xGA average was 0.55, yet the former West Ham man conceded 0.85 per 90.</p>
      <p>To summarise, Klopp’s team faced higher value efforts last season, but also conceded fewer goals. The latter is the talking point, but the former contradicts the argument that Liverpool’s defence isn’t as good this term.</p>
      <p>It isn’t as simple as saying Alisson transforms the defence, but his ability in goal makes the great defence appear to be an exceptional one. Without him, the perception is the team isn’t as reliable when in fact the team, defensively, is essentially performing at a similar level.</p>
      <p>It’s been a similar story throughout Klopp’s time on Merseyside. During his first season in charge, Liverpool conceded 50 goals in total despite keeping 11 clean sheets. However, their xGA tally was 37.88 and their post-shot total was 35.6. The soft goals conceded by the keepers meant the entire defence was harshly, and perhaps wrongly, judged.</p>
      <p>In Klopp’s second season, the numbers improved slightly. The Reds conceded 42 goals from an xGA total of 37.65 and a post-shot total of 35.2, while managing 12 clean sheets. This was a huge improvement on actual goals against, while the underlying stats remained eerily consistent despite the sweeping changes made to the playing personnel, showing that the system used by the charismatic German was working.</p>
      <p>Historically, a goal difference of plus 30 is enough for a top-four finish. With the Reds conceded below 40, they had the firepower to ensure they finished in Champions League places. The only position putting that under threat was underperforming goalkeepers.</p>
      <p>The 2017/18 campaign followed a similar pattern. Liverpool underperformed once more, conceding 38 goals with an xGA total of 35.75, and a post-shot total of 34.</p>
      <p>The improvement in actual goals conceded coincides with Virgil van Dijk’s arrival and the decision to reinstate Loris Karius as the team’s No.1. It’s often forgotten - maybe even overlooked because of what happened in the Champions League final - but the former Mainz shot-stopper had a positive impact on the team. His proactive approach played a part in Liverpool posting, at that point, their best defensive numbers of the Klopp era. He wasn’t world-class, but he could be considered par, which was better than Simon Mignolet's numbers.</p>
      <p>The two Liverpool keepers kept 17 clean sheets between them, just four fewer than Alisson managed, yet conceded 16 more goals. Liverpool need 15 clean sheets from their remaining 25 games to match what Karius and Mignolet achieved. If they fail to do that, in the eyes of those who put a lot weight behind clean sheets, that team had a more reliable defence than the current one.</p>
      <p>Is that team, the one with Alberto Moreno at left-back and no Fabinho in midfield, really more resilient than the current machine assembled by Klopp? Not a chance.</p>
      <p>That, if nothing else, proves just how overrated clean sheets are.</p>
