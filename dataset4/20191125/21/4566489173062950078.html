      <p>Affectionately known as "The Godfather of Shock Rock," he opened his show with "Feed My Frankenstein," and he continued with "No More Mr. Nice Guy" and the infectious "Bed of Nails."</p>
      <p>He took his fans on a trip down memory lane to the late '80s with the spitfire "He's Back (The Man Behind the Mask)." The highlight performance was his vivacious version of "Poison," which is this journalist's all-time favorite Alice Cooper tune, and he nailed it as always. Equally incredible was Nita Strauss's killer guitar solo, which left many fans in total awe of her talent.</p>

      <p>It was followed by "Roses on White Lace," the uptempo "My Stars" and "Black Widow Jam," which was simply electrifying. After the eerie and downtempo "I Love the Dead," he closed with "Escape" and "Teenage Frankenstein."</p>
      <p>For his encore, the iconic rocker belted out "Under My Wheels" and his signature tune "School's Out," where he left his fans and listeners wanting to hear more.</p>
