      <h2>Walt Harris launched a plea for information about the disappearance of Aniah Blanchard last month, but authorities now believe remains found in Alabama belong to the missing teenager</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:42:17+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:42</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Authorities in Alabama say they have "good reason" to believe human remains found in the area belong to the missing step daughter of UFC heavyweight fighter Walt Harris.</p>
      <p>Harris launched a plea for information on social media after Aniah Blanchard, 19, disappeared last month and her car was found around 50 miles away with damage to the right front fender and scrapes on the passenger side door.</p>
      <p>Lee County District Attorney Brandon Hughes said that they believe remains found on a county road in nearby Macon County belong to the missing teenager.</p>
      <p>"I can confirm that human remains have been found in Macon County on County Road 2, and we have good reason to believe they are that of Aniah Blanchard,'' Hughes said, via <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2019/11/report-aniah-blanchards-body-may-have-been-found.html">AL.com</a> .</p>

      <p>A statement from Auburn police read: “During the course of the ongoing investigation into the disappearance of Aniah Blanchard, investigators obtained information regarding the possible location of a body.</p>
      <p>“On November 25, 2019, at approximately 10:45 a.m., Auburn Police, along with members of the Task Force, Lee County DA’s Office, U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force, ALEA and Montgomery County Sheriff Office, responded to a wooded area in the 38,000 block of County Road 2 in Shorter, Alabama.</p>

      <p>“After a brief search by Investigators they located what appeared to be human remains several feet into the woodline. A complete investigation is underway by ALEA and Auburn Police to determine the identity and how the victim came to be at that location. The examination will explore if the remains are those of Aniah Blanchard who went missing on October 24, 2019.</p>
      <p>“The case remains under investigation by the Auburn Police Division.”</p>

      <p>Auburn police detective Josh Mixon said it appeared she had suffered a life-threatening injury based on blood found inside the car, abandoned at an apartment complex in Montgomery, Alabama.</p>
      <p>Police have arrested two men, Ibraheem Yazeed, 29, and Antwain Shamar, 35, in connection with her disappearance with both charged with 1st-degree kidnapping.</p>

      <p>Mixon testified that convenience store footage showed a man, later identified as Yazeed, look over at Blanchard whilst buying a drink, with a man at the store telling investigators he saw him force Blanchard into her car and drive away.</p>
      <p>Fisher appeared in court for the first time today accused of providing "material assistance to Yazeed by providing transportation to Yazeed, and disposing of evidence," according to court records made public on Monday.</p>

      <p>Prosecutors have also charged a third man, David Johnson Jr, with hindering prosecution after making a third arrest.</p>
      <p>After her disappearance, Harris, a professional fighter since 2011 with a record of 13 wins and seven losses, shared pictures of his step daughter with the caption: "Please help find my baby Aniah Blanchard she is missing!"</p>
      <p>He was scheduled to compete as the headliner at UFC Washington against Alistair Overeem on December 7 but pulled out due to Blanchard's disappearance.</p>
