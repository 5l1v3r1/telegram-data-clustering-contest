      <p>Two goals in four first half minutes - the first of which from Conor Hourihane who Bruce brought to the club almost two years ago - did for the hapless Magpies.</p>
      <p>Returning captain Jack Grealish sparkled for Dean Smith’s men, winning both free-kicks for Villa’s goals, the second which the influential Hourihane put on a plate for Anwar El Ghazi.</p>
      <p>The hosts were the better side throughout against limited opposition to end a run of three straight top flight defeats and put daylight between themselves and the drop zone.</p>
      <p>Bruce, who politely declined the Holte End’s request for a wave with five minutes to go, endured some difficult times at Villa Park before he was axed and this was yet another.</p>
      <p>The tough end to Bruce’s Villa Park regime came 13 months ago. He was the victim of the high-profile cabbage-gate, where the vegetable was launched his way during his final game in charge, a home draw with bottom club Preston.</p>
      <p>Bruce, appointed at boyhood club Newcastle in the summer after a short stint with Sheffield Wednesday, admitted the manner of his Villa departure was one of the most unsavoury periods of his career in football.</p>
      <p>His B6 replacement Smith, working under the club’s new owners the NSWE group, achieved what Bruce just failed in guiding the club back to the top flight.</p>
      <p>But there was polite applause from fans for the former boss, who responded with thumbs up and handshakes, supporters acknowledging the work Bruce carried out in difficult personal and ownership circumstances at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>Smith was able to call on Grealish and Tom Heaton for the televised clash.</p>
      <p>Skipper Grealish had been missing with a troublesome calf injury that had sidelined him since the defeat at Manchester City exactly a month ago.</p>
      <p>Goalkeeper Heaton took his place back between the sticks, but there was no return for defender Bjorn Engels, still missing with a hip injury.</p>
      <p>Grealish and Hourihane were in for Marvelous Nakamba and Trezeguet.</p>
      <p>Contrary to Villa’s recent form, the Magpies arrived in Birmingham on the back of just one defeat in five, winning three of those top flight contests.</p>
      <p>The hosts monopolised the ball in the early stages, albeit with little pressure on the visitors’ goal. Newcastle, through the pace of attackers Allan Saint-Maximin and Miguel Almiron, looked a handful on the break.</p>
      <p>Villa Park took a sharp intake of breath when Grealish went down in pain from a late DeAndre Yedlin tackle, but the skipper rose to his feet.</p>
      <p>And a smart Grealish dummy should have led to the opener 13 minutes in. Matt Targett’s low ball from the left looked perfect but El Ghazi was a stud’s length away with his lunge. Had he committed more the Dutchman would’ve netted.</p>
      <p>Bruce’s visitors saw precious little of the ball. They were exemplified in a nutshell as big striker Joelinton cleared a Villa corner before Saint-Maximin charged the length of the pitch to tee up Almiron, whose touch was hopeless.</p>
      <p>Douglas Luiz was pulling the strings and was extremely unlucky to be denied by a stunning Martin Dubravka save to keep out his 22-yard strike.</p>
      <p>But Villa weren’t to be denied for long as Grealish’s influence grew. The captain won a free-kick from Federico Fernandez’s push in the back just after half hour.</p>
      <p>Hourihane did the rest, the Irishman bending a fine left-footed effort around the ball and in at the near post from Grealish’s set.</p>
      <p>Villa were purring and tore Newcastle to shreds down the left. Four minutes later Grealish clicked through the gears and was hacked down by Fernandez.</p>
      <p>Hourihane’s delivery was on the money for El Ghazi to lift into the roof of the net. The attacker walked away sheepishly, half-expecting a VAR intervention, but none rightly came and the hosts were 2-0 up.</p>
      <p>Villa were toying were the hapless visitors at times, but Heaton was alive to keep out Fernandez’s header, before El Ghazi’s low strike was correctly ruled offside.</p>
      <p>Heaton was at his best to deny Saint-Maximin’s effort from distance just after the break.</p>
      <p>The Tyneside visitors showed signs of spirit after the break but Villa should have extended their lead. Ezri Konsa directed his free header from a Grealish corner at Dubravka.</p>
      <p>There was no way through for Newcastle, who had Isaac Hayden shoot weakly at Heaton before Villa stopper Konsa sliced inches wide of his own top corner.</p>
      <p>Substitute Andy Carroll’s fierce right-footed volley was straight at Heaton with 20 minutes to go but Villa had the visitors at arm’s length.</p>
      <p>Villa should have put Newcastle to the sword as Grealish shot off target before John McGinn shot at Dubravka and Wesley was somehow denied from six yards, but it mattered little.</p>
