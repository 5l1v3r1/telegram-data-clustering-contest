      <p>The 32-year-old is currently one of the French side's highest-paid players, reportedly picking up over Â£500,000 a month, and he is under contract at the Stade Velodrome until 2022.</p>

      <p>While they are thought to be in pole position to do a deal, the report also suggests that other Turkish clubs are interested in signing the midfielder.</p>
      <p>Payet has scored 25 goals in 107 appearance for the French side since returning to his native country from West Ham United in January 2017.</p>
