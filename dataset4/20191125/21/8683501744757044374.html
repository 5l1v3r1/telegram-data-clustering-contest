      <p>This year marked the end of an era for Tyler Perry’s filmmaking career, as <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2467649/a-madea-family-funeral-review">the final movie in his <i>Madea</i> film series, <i>A Madea Family Funeral</i></a>, was released back in March. Perry’s time playing the elderly, tough, sass-talking character is over, and now the filmmaker has announced that his first post-Madea movie, <i>A Fall From Grace</i>, will be a Netflix release. Take a look!</p>

      <p>A lot of well-known creative minds have forged alliances with Netflix in recent years, from <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485370/why-the-irishmans-producer-had-no-second-thoughts-about-taking-it-to-netflix">Martin Scorsese</a> and Adam Sandler on the movie side of things, to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2453329/netflix-just-announced-its-first-shows-with-shonda-rhimes-and-we-couldnt-be-more-excited">Shonda Rhimes</a> and Ryan Murphy in the TV realm. Now Tyler Perry can count himself among the bunch, as the thriller <i>A Fall From Grace</i> will premiere on the streaming platform in the middle of next January. This marks the first time a Perry-made movie is being released exclusively <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2485574/former-netflix-users-reveal-why-they-recently-cancelled-service">on Netflix</a>.</p>
      <p>As you can see above, the cast includes Crystal Fox, Phylicia Rashad, Bresha Webb, Cicely Tyson (a frequently collaborator of Tyler Perry’s) and Tyler Perry himself. Per <a href="https://twitter.com/strongblacklead/status/1197907874925531136">Netflix’s Strong Black Lead Twitter account</a>, <i>A Fall From Grace</i> follows a divorced woman who “feels restored by a new romance,” but then “secrets soon start to erode her short-lived joy.” Netflix also provided the following synopsis on its <i>A Fall From Grace</i> title page:</p>
      <blockquote>When a law-abiding woman gets indicted for murdering her husband, her lawyer soon realizes that a larger conspiracy may be at work.</blockquote>
      <p><i>Supergirl</i> actor Mehcad Brooks, who’s <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485071/mortal-kombat-director-teases-big-plans-for-jax">attached to the upcoming <i>Mortal Kombat</i> reboot</a>, was also tagged in the picture from the Strong Black Lead post, indicating he’s a member of the cast. <a href="https://www.blackfilm.com/read/2019/11/netflix-to-release-tyler-perrys-new-film-a-fall-from-grace/">Black Film</a> reports that Adrian Pasdar, Matthew Law, Donovan Christie Jr., Walter Fauntleroy and Angela Marie will also star.</p>
      <p>Whether it’s a traditional theatrical release or exclusive to a streaming service, usually you hear that a movie’s in development years before the final product is delivered. Tyler Perry’s <i>A Fall From Grace</i> is one of the exceptions, as this Netflix announcement was the first word of its existence. While Perry is arguably best known for his comedy work, <i>A Fall From Grace</i> isn’t his first venture into the thriller genre, with the most recent being <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2396361/acrimony-review">the Taraji P. Henson-led <i>Acrimony</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The release of <i>A Madea Family Funeral</i> and the announcement of <i>A Fall From Grace</i> heading to Netflix aren’t the only reasons 2019 was a big year for Tyler Perry. He moved Tyler Perry Studios into a new complex in southwest Atlanta, Georgia that stretches across 330 acres. In addition to delivering <i>A Fall From Grace</i>, this studio complex is also home to six new shows that he’s written and directed/will direct, two of which, <i>The Oval</i> and <i>Sistas</i>, recently premiered on BET.</p>
      <p><i>A Fall From Grace</i> premieres on Netflix January 17. Stay tuned to CinemaBlend for more updates on what Tyler Perry has coming up.
