      <h1>Peru court orders release of opposition leader Keiko Fujimori</h1>

      <p>Peru's Constitutional Court on Monday ordered the release of opposition leader Keiko Fujimori, after more than a year of pre-trial detention.</p>
      <p>Fujimori, 44, has been held since October last year pending her trial in a corruption case linked to Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht.</p>
      <p>"The court has agreed to accept habeas corpus," the president of the court Ernesto Blume said, announcing a ruling that cannot be appealed.</p>
      <p>The legal phrase "habeas corpus" refers to the right of a prisoner to be brought before a court or released.</p>
      <p>Blume made clear that the Constitutional Court ruling had no bearing on the corruption case against her.</p>
      <p>The eldest daughter of disgraced former president Alberto Fujimori, Keiko Fujimori is accused of accepting $1.2 million in illicit party funding from Odebrecht for her 2011 presidential campaign.</p>
      <p>Once Peru's most popular politician, Monday's decision theoretically gives her time to campaign for presidential elections slated for July 2021.</p>
      <p>"Justice has been done, a divine justice. God is great!" said her husband, US citizen Mark Vito, who had begun a hunger strike outside his wife's prison on the outskirts of Lima to press for her release</p>
      <p>Following a previous appeal, the Supreme Court had halved the detention period, earmarking her release for next April.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors have accused a total of 11 people linked to Fujimori's party of running a criminal organization to raise money for her 2011 campaign.</p>
      <p>Odebrecht has admitted paying at least $29 million in bribes to Peruvian officials since 2004.</p>
      <p>Three former presidents are being investigated over Odebrecht while a fourth, Alan Garcia, committed suicide in April after police arrived at his house to arrest him for money laundering.</p>
