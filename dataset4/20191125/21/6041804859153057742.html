      <p>Malayalam actress Parvathy Thiruvothu is known for not mincing words while expressing her opinions on popular cinema and the way the irresponsible portrayal of negative characters can indeed influence the audiences in a negative manner.</p>
      <p>Sitting next to<a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/movienews/vijay-deverakonda-friendship-extended-to-director-nag-ashwin-son/"> Vijay Deverakonda</a>, she spoke boldly about the problem with portraying misogynistic characters like in ‘Arjun Reddy’ and ‘Kabir Reddy’ where the toxic masculinity was glorified to the extent that those scenes were received with applause.</p>
      <p>Then there are these social media platforms like YouTube, where people are involved in a mob-like manner trying to appreciate the toxic mentality of a problematic guy as in ‘Arjun Reddy’. In the past, Parvathi lambasted Malayalam superstars like Mammooty and Mohanlal.</p>
      <p>She clearly described how the portrayal of the negative characters must be like ‘watch it and leave it there’, not taking the negative thing along.</p>
      <p>Vijay Deverakonda had been an active listener when the Malayalam actress was discussing the problem, and seemed to be lost in thought when she was explaining how murky the mob mentality has turned out to be on YouTube.</p>
