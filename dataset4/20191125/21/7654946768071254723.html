      <p>A brute with a machete slashed a man multiple times in the Bronx Monday afternoon, cops said.</p>
      <p>The violent encounter unfolded just after 2:30 p.m. near Southern Boulevard and E. 149th Street, according to police.</p>
      <p>A woman, who told The Post she witnessed the violence, said the attack badly injured the man — and may have severed part of his arm.</p>
      <p>The man, whose name and age were not immediately known, was rushed to Lincoln Hospital with cuts to his neck, right arm and hand, cops said. He was expected to survive, according to cops.</p>
      <p>Surveillance video shows a car roll up on Southern Boulevard, a machete-wielding man gets out and runs into a laundromat.</p>
      <p>Two other men get out and, at one point, one of them throws something into the building, before they flee in car, the video shows.</p>
      <p>Police said the attacker fled in a car and is still on the loose.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear what triggered the attack or how many people were involved, according to officials.</p>
      <p>A resident, who didn’t give his name, said, two kids were arguing and “it got violent.</p>
      <p>“They had beef with each other,” he said.</p>
