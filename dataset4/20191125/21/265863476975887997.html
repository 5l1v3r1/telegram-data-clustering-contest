      <h1>Wendy Williams Disses Taylor Swift After Winning The ‘Artist Of The Decade’ Award At The AMAs – Says ‘Taste Has Cheapened!’</h1>

      <p>This may have been the biggest honor of Taylor Swift’s career but Wendy Williams is here to rain on her parade! The talk show host seemed to throw shade at the singer after she was awarded the Artist of the Decade title at the AMAs!</p>
      <p>Wendy admitted that she does think Taylor’s songs are super catchy and she loves them but she still argued that she doesn’t deserve such a huge award for them.</p>
      <p>She pretty much shocked everyone in her audience when she said it but either way, Wendy Williams is well known for how blunt she is so she did not shy away from dissing the songstress.</p>
      <p>She even went as far as to say that it’s ‘unforgivable’ she has more trophies from the American Music Awards than huge icons such as Madonna, Prince and Michael Jackson.</p>
      <p>‘Taylor Swift made history, which is unbelievable to me. So, good for her, she won six awards. She has a total of 29 awards, which sounds unbelievable, but what sounds unforgivable is that she’s got more awards than Michael Jackson, Prince, and Madonna,’ Wendy told her studio audience earlier today.</p>
      <p>She continued to discuss the matter, questioning Taylor’s huge influence in the music industry in the last ten years or so.</p>
      <p>‘Artist of the Decade? Is she who’s been firing you up for the last 10 years? I think taste has cheapened through the years and a lot of things… Life in general I think has cheapened,’ the host said before giving some examples including ‘poisonous food’ and ‘tattered clothes!’</p>
      <p>But she wanted to make it clear that she has absolutely nothing against Taylor, adding that, in reality, she ‘appreciates’ her.</p>
      <p>Regardless, before moving on to another hot topic, she once again asked herself if she really deserves ‘Artist of the Year!’</p>
