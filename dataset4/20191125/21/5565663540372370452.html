      <p>Zimbabwean doctors who have been on industrial action for more than 80 days have begun leaving the country to look for greener pastures after the government has failed to fix respond to their needs. <br/><br/>In a statement on Monday the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association said, "For every day that passes, more lives are being lost, yet we have a competent crop of reputable and world class Doctors, who are more than willing to go back to work at this very moment, to save lives<br/><br/>"The avoidable exodus of Doctors has already begun and one can only imagine what that will mean for our fellow countrymen who cannot fly to China for treatment."<br/><br/>The association added that the government has not provided any solution to the cahllenges that the doctors are facing but they have instead fired them.<br/><br/>"The Firing of doctors and the subsequent ridiculous and egotistical talks of replacing our members seem to be the bestÂ  Ministry has to offer to date."<br/><br/>Last week the Acting Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Mangaliso Ndlovu told journalists that"Turning to hospital doctors, a total of 480 disciplinary cases have so far been heard. An additional 149 doctors were found guilty and discharged, bringing the cumulative total of the doctors discharged to 435.<br/><br/>"Cabinet was informed of a meeting which was held on 15th November, 2019 between the Minister of Health and Child Care and representatives from the Senior and Junior Doctors Association. While positive strides were made at the meeting, with some doctors showing a willingness to return to work, Cabinet has resolved that those doctors already discharged have to apply for readmission. Government will not rescind its position on the fired doctors."</p>
