      <p>The crash occurred about 5.20am in the inbound lanes just before the intersection with Beams Road, but it has since been cleared.</p>
      <p>Delays for inbound vehicles stretched back past to the Gateway Motorway turn-off at one stage, but while the crash has been cleared, some residual delays remain.</p>
