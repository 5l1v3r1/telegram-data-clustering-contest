      <h1>Huawei announces the MatePad Pro tablet in China</h1>
      <h2>Company claims it is the first tablet with a cut-out front camera like it’s a good thing</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:59:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:59</time> by <a rel="author">Henry Burrell</a></address>
      <p>Huawei has unveiled the MatePad Pro, its new high-end tablet. It has the same Kirin 990 chip you’ll find in the Mate 30 Pro and sports a 10.8in LCD display with an attractive 16:10 aspect ratio.</p>
      <p>It takes a few design chops from Apple’s iPad Pro with curved corners to the screen and a familiar looking keyboard cover and pen accessory.</p>
      <p>There are a few different specs to choose from including 6/8GB RAM and up to 512GB storage, alongside very fast 45W charging as standard. It runs Huawei’s EMUI 10 skin over Android 10 but cannot run Google apps and services following Huawei’s ongoing US trade ban.</p>
      <p>That won’t be a problem in the company’s native China, but puts a question mark over the tablet ever being released in Europe, with no date confirmed. That’s a shame as the MatePad Pro starts at CNY 3,299, which is around £360 – much more affordable than Apple’s equivalent cheapest iPad Pro at £769.</p>

      <p>That said, the usefulness of the MatePad Pro will be hampered for many if it can’t access Google services – and often the price would not convert exactly if released in the west, as it would likely be priced higher.</p>
      <p>The tablet is also one of the first ever to have a cut-out for its front facing camera. We understand why these have become a thing on Android phones, but it seems an unnecessary design choice for a tablet. Surely Huawei could have put the single camera in the bezel and left the screen uninterrupted if it had wanted to?</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3778665-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Ftablets%2Fhuawei-announces-matepad-pro-tablet-3778665%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2F2019%2F11%2F25%2Fhuawei-matebook-pro-small-bezels%2F">Engadget</a>, the tablet’s bezels are even thinner than the iPad Pro’s, hence the camera moving to underneath the display. Huwaei may have outdone Apple on the thinness of its bezels but we feel it’s a step back to have a camera cut-out.</p>
      <p>Pre-orders start for the tablet today with it going on sale on 12 December. You might be able to import one if you have your heart set on it.</p>
