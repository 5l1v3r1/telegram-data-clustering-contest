      <p>Nov. 25 (UPI) -- The aircraft carrier honoring President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kennedy-Assassination/?tps=1">John F. Kennedy</a>, currently known as CVN 79, will be christened on Dec. 7, builder Huntington Ingalls Industries announced on Monday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Caroline_Kennedy_Schlossberg/?tps=1">Caroline Kennedy</a>, former ambassador to Japan and Kennedy's daughter, is the <a href="https://newsroom.huntingtoningalls.com/releases/media-advisorynewport-news-shipbuilding-to-host-christening-and-media-day-events-for-aircraft-carrier-john-f-kennedy-cvn-79">ship's sponsor</a> and will smash a bottle of sparkling wine against the ship's hull in a christening ceremony in Newport News, Va.</p>
      <p>The nuclear-powered ship, the second in the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Gerald_R._Ford/?tps=1">Gerald R. Ford</a>-class of aircraft carriers, is expected to be formally commissioned to enter U.S. Navy service in 2020.</p>
      <p>Over 3,000 shipbuilders and 2,000 suppliers have been involved in the construction of the ship since its keel was laid in 2015. Many of the $13 billion ship's systems, powered by steam on Nimitz-class carriers, are electrically powered -- among other upgrades and changes to vessel operation.</p>
      <p>The ship is <a href="https://www.upi.com/Defense-News/2019/10/30/Aircraft-carrier-John-F-Kennedy-meets-water-as-HII-floods-dry-dock/8651572450193/">designed to save</a> the Navy $4 billion in total ownership cost over its expected 50-year lifespan, with fewer overall components, an extended future drydock interval and ship-wide air conditioning. The 1,106-feet long ship can accommodate 90 combat aircraft at one time.</p>
      <p>When the ship's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/navy-aircraft-carrier-john-f-kennedy-seal-has-mq25-drone-2019-11">official seal</a> was unveiled in early November, it was noted that in addition to honoring Kennedy's Navy service and his vision for space exploration, it features a drawing of the aircraft carrier with aircraft on its deck that some took as a clue to how the vessel could be used.</p>
      <p>An E-2 Hawkeye early warning plane with wings folded, several F/A-18 fighter planes, an F-35C fighter plane and an H-60 helicopter are prominent are included on the carrier's deck -- as is an MQ-25 Stingray unmanned aerial vehicle. The addition of the MQ-25, which is capable of refueling fighter planes in the air, is a clue that the Navy firmly expects to use UAVs in key roles supporting the combat functions of the ship.</p>
      <p>The seal "displays future naval aviation capabilities that the aircraft carrier will likely support throughout its estimated 50-year service life," Cmdr. Jennifer Cragg of Naval Air Force Atlantic confirmed.</p>
      <p>Having the UAV aboard the vessel could allow fighter planes "to reach [combat air patrol] stations 1,000 [nautical miles] from the carrier and conduct long-range attacks to respond promptly to aggression while keeping the carrier far enough away from threat areas to reduce the density of air and missile threats," according to a 2018 report by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.</p>
