Right now, probably the world's most famous dog,'' Trump said as he introduced Conan to the news media at the White House Rose Garden on Monday.<br/><br/>Trump says he gave Conan a medal and a plaque.<br/><br/>Trump has wanted to honor the Belgian Malinois since the late October raid on al-Baghdadi's compound in northwest Syria.<br/><br/>Conan was slightly injured in the operation but has since recovered and returned to active duty.<br/><br/>After the operation, Trump posted an altered image on Twitter of him presenting Conan with a Medal of Honor.
