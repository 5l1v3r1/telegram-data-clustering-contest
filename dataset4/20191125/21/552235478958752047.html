      <h1>Leigh Griffiths receives huge Celtic boost as Neil Lennon makes glowing striker prediction</h1>
      <h2>The 29-year-old has had to contain himself with a watching brief with Lennon's side securing qualification to the last 32 of the Europa League.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:09:48+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:09</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Confident Neil Lennon believes <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leigh-griffiths">Leigh Griffiths'</a> best days in a Celtic jersey are still to come after the striker returned to action against Livingston.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/">Scotland</a> international looked dangerous in the closing stages of the 4-0 win and made his first appearance in three months after battling a raft of injuries.</p>
      <p>Griffiths started the season in fine form after stepping away from the game to deal with personal issues during the second half of last season.</p>
      <p>But the 29-year-old has had to contain himself with a watching brief with Lennon's side securing qualification to the last 32 of the Europa League.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/odsonne-edouard">Odsonne Edouard</a> has ploughed a lone furrow for much of the campaign with Griffiths and Vakoun Bayo on the sidelines.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> boss revealed the pair have spoken about his long-term future with the Premiership champions.</p>
      <p>And the Irishman insists there's no reason to suggest Griffiths can't rediscover his best form after returning to the first team fold.</p>
      <p>He told Celtic TV: "I have spoken to him about this.</p>
      <p>"I didn't come to Celtic until I was 29 and people thought I had been here all my life.</p>
      <p>"If you look after yourself and keep yourself in good condition, you can play for a long time now, the way the modern game is going.</p>
      <p>"He certainly has the appetite for it. There is a hunger there to get back in and he really missed playing.</p>

      <p>"Hopefully he will get fitter and stronger and have a good run of games now. He needs to do extra work, he needs to stay on top of his condition.</p>
      <p>"He is in reasonable condition now and he is working hard and to make sure he stays fit.</p>
      <p>"The fitter you are, the more robust you become and then you are less likely to pick up soft tissue injuries which is one that he had with a thigh strain.</p>
      <p>"It is good to have him back, it adds that little bit of quality to the attack and strength that we already have."</p>
