      <p>Black Friday deals are finally here, and some of the best and most highly anticipated sales will be on Apple products, Notably, the Apple Watch is set to get some impressive discounts that make Black Friday a great time to buy one.</p>
      <p>If you’re in the market for an Apple Watch, there a range of deals and discounts worth considering on older and newer models of the smartwatch.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the biggest deals will be on the older Apple Watch Series 3, which doesn’t have all the same high-tech features as the latest Series 5 model. Retailers that have the Apple Watch Series 4 still in stock will discount it too, so you’re likely to find the biggest price cuts on these two older models.</p>
      <p>The Apple Watch Series 5 may get a few smaller discounts here or there, but because it’s so new, the deals may not be as impressive as the ones on other models.</p>
