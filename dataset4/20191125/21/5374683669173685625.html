      <p>The Conservative Party in Britain, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, will ban local councils from boycotting products from foreign countries, including Israel.</p>
      <p>The pledge is made in the party’s election policy manifesto in the run-up to the Dec. 12 general elections.</p>
      <p>“We will ban public bodies from imposing their own direct or indirect boycotts, disinvestment or sanctions campaigns against foreign countries. These undermine community cohesion,” the document released Sunday says.</p>
      <p>Introducing a law against such boycotts would prevent Labor-majority local councils from imposing boycotts against Israel, according to the Jewish Chronicle.</p>
      <p>In its election policy manifesto published Thursday, the Labour Party said it would stop selling weapons to Israel.</p>
      <p>British voters will choose a new Parliament in the wake of the Brexit controversy. Parliamentarians backed Johnson’s call for a vote in late October.</p>
