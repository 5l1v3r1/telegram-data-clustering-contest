      <h1>Intelligence Panel to Release Impeachment Report Soon After Thanksgiving</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:00:22+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Nicholas Fandos</a></address>
      <p>WASHINGTON — Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee plan to deliver a report soon after Thanksgiving making the case for impeaching President Trump, its chairman said on Monday, moving quickly to escalate what he called “urgent” evidence of wrongdoing by the president.</p>
      <p>Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the Intelligence Committee chairman, wrote in a letter to colleagues that after two months of inquiry and despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/politics/impeachment-witnesses.html?module=inline">consistent stonewalling by Mr. Trump</a>, his panel had uncovered “massive amounts of evidence” pointing to misconduct and “corrupt intent” by the president related to Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Mr. Schiff’s staff is now working to compile that evidence into a written report for public release and transmittal to the House Judiciary Committee shortly after lawmakers return from their holiday break. The judiciary panel is expected to promptly draft and debate articles of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/trump-impeachment?module=inline">impeachment</a> against Mr. Trump based on its findings and potentially other alleged offenses.</p>
      <p>“The president has accepted or enlisted foreign nations to interfere in our upcoming elections, including the next one; this is an urgent matter that cannot wait if we are to protect the nation’s security and the integrity of our elections,” Mr. Schiff wrote.</p>
      <p>The decision to press ahead quickly, however, means that Democrats are making a calculated decision to forgo opportunities to obtain more testimony and records that are relevant to their inquiry, a risk that was underscored hours after they announced their plans. A pair of court rulings on Monday held out the possibility that the House could eventually gain access to additional new evidence that could strengthen their case.</p>
      <p>In one long-anticipated decision, a federal judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/us/politics/mcgahn-testimony-ruling.html?module=inline">ruled that Donald F. McGahn II</a>, the former White House counsel, must testify before impeachment investigators about Mr. Trump’s efforts to obstruct the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III into Russia’s election interference and the Trump campaign.</p>
      <p>While Mr. McGahn is unlikely to appear anytime soon, the ruling was significant because it emphatically rejected the Trump administration’s assertion that top presidential advisers are absolutely immune from congressional subpoenas, calling the principle a “fiction” that “simply does not exist.” The White House has used the same justification to argue that officials like John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, cannot testify in the Ukraine investigation.</p>
      <p>“To those witnesses who hide behind fallacious claims of absolute immunity,” Mr. Schiff said in a statement, “this ruling shows again how meritless their position remains.”</p>
      <p>Hours earlier, a different federal judge in Washington ruled that the Defense Department must turn over to the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit news organization, communications it had with the White House Office of Management and Budget about the suspension of the military aid for Ukraine. Democrats are not party to the suit, but the release of the records in question could benefit their inquiry.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration is all but certain to appeal both rulings, a process that could tie up the testimony and records in courts for many months. Democrats have made clear that they are unwilling to wait for that process to play out, meaning their inquiry may simply never benefit from any information that may come to light.</p>
      <p>“We will not allow the president or others to drag this out for months on end in the courts,” Mr. Schiff wrote on Monday, expressing confidence in the case in hand.</p>
      <p>His committee has already collected dozens of hours of testimony supporting the underlying allegation at the center of the impeachment inquiry: that the president used the powers of his office to pressure Ukraine to discredit his political rivals, by pressing its leader to announce investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and an unsupported theory that Democrats conspired with Ukraine to interfere in the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>“As the evidence conclusively shows, President Trump conditioned official acts — a White House meeting desperately desired by the new Ukrainian president and critical U.S. military assistance — on Ukraine announcing sham, politically motivated investigations that would help President Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign,” Mr. Schiff said, encapsulating what is likely to be the core of the Democrats’ report.</p>
      <p>Mr. Schiff did not put a precise date on the delivery of his report to the Judiciary Committee, but the rough timeline he outlined would put Democrats on track to vote on impeachment articles by the end of the year, barring unexpected complications or a collapse in support within their caucus. If they are successful, a trial to determine whether Mr. Trump will be acquitted or removed from office would follow in the Senate.</p>
      <p>At this point, Democrats expect to get little to no Republican support in the House. The president’s allies have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/us/politics/trump-impeachment-defense.html?module=inline">united firmly behind him</a> to argue either that the facts laid out by senior diplomats and administration officials are incorrect or that they simply do not merit impeachment.</p>
      <p>The Judiciary Committee is expected in the coming days to announce public impeachment hearings to take place next week to hear the evidence on Ukraine and to begin to draft and debate impeachment articles, which are roughly analogous to charges in a courtroom trial. They could also convene sessions with expert witnesses to define impeachable offenses and offer Mr. Trump and his legal team a chance to present a defense or exculpatory evidence.</p>
      <p>Mr. Schiff said that his committee would continue investigative work as it drafts its written report, and he said he could not rule out additional witness depositions or public hearings. The committee already conducted 17 private witness interviews and questioned a dozen of those witnesses in nationally televised hearings over the last two weeks.</p>
      <p>“Even as we draft our report, we are open to the possibility that further evidence will come to light, whether in the form of witnesses who provide testimony or documents that become available,” Mr. Schiff said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Schiff indicated that the Intelligence Committee would “catalog the instances of noncompliance with lawful subpoenas” as a part of its report so the Judiciary Committee could consider drafting an article of impeachment charging the president with obstructing Congress. Mr. Schiff noted in his letter that the Judiciary Committee approved an article along those lines in 1974 as it recommended the impeachment of Richard M. Nixon.</p>
      <p>Republicans are said to be drafting their own dissenting views to accompany the report.</p>
      <p>As Democrats seek to wrap up their work and present a compelling case to the public for impeaching Mr. Trump, additional evidence relevant to their inquiry continues to trickle out.</p>
      <p>In the public records case decided on Monday, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2019cv3265-17">wrote in a 16-page opinion</a> that the Defense Department documents must be handed over between Dec. 12 and Dec. 20, citing the urgency of the House’s impeachment inquiry. That timetable matches the one Democratic leaders are eyeing for considering impeachment articles against Mr. Trump in the Judiciary Committee and on the House floor, but an appeal could delay the release.</p>
      <p>“The requested documents are sought in order to inform the public on a matter of extreme national concern,” she wrote. “Only an informed electorate can develop its opinions and persuasively petition its elected officials to act in ways which further the aims of those opinions.”</p>
      <p>Another public records request, though, is already informing the case. On Friday, American Oversight, a liberal watchdog group, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/23/us/politics/pompeo-trump-ukraine-impeachment.html?module=inline">began releasing documents</a> it obtained from the State Department through another public information lawsuit.</p>
      <p>They included emails that showed that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke at least twice last spring to Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s private lawyer, at a time he was trying to oust a long-serving American ambassador in Kyiv and pressuring Ukraine to conduct the investigations Mr. Trump sought.</p>
