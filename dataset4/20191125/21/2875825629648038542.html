      <p>Anthony Joshua took some time out of his preparations for his rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr to train with a mega fan.</p>
      <p>Joshua is looking to win back his world heavyweight titles when he faces off against Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabia on December 7.</p>
      <p>Before that bout, the Brit took to the ring with fan and fellow boxer Kate Farley for a special sparring session.</p>
      <p>Kate, who suffers from cerebral palsy, has been boxing since 2016 and admitted she would love to take to the ring with AJ.</p>

      <p>Joshua offered Kate a chance to spar him before she replied: "Hell yeah!".</p>
      <p>The pair are then seen grappling and throwing punches on their knees before a clever combination sends Joshua sprawling over.</p>
      <p>His fans won't want to see a repeat next month but Joshua sees the funny side, although Kate offers her apologies.</p>

      <p>Joshua has now touched down in Saudi Arabia ahead of the fight and he is confident of getting revenge on Ruiz Jr.</p>
      <p>He said: "They think he's so great, so when I beat him I want everybody to bow to my feet and tell me how great I am."</p>
      <p>"I couldn't beat Ruiz Jr before and get the credit I deserved.</p>
      <p>"You saw me in the ring [before the fight] - I wasn't fighting King Kong, was I? [I didn't have] that mindset.</p>
      <p>"Apparently I'm fighting the quickest hands and the best fighter in the division. So once I beat him I want everybody to bow to me."</p>
