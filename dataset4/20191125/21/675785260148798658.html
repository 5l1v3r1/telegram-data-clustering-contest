      <h2>Arsenal boss Unai Emery is under increasing pressure in north London following the draw with Southampton, which left his side eighth in the table</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:14:05+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:14</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Gary Neville believes the Arsenal board are split over whether to sack Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>The Gunners boss finds himself under increasing pressure following the 2-2 draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>That result made it six wins without a win and left <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> in eighth, eight points adrift of the top four.</p>
      <p>Emery is now fighting for his future and Neville believes there will be some board members who feel the time has come for him to move on.</p>
      <p>"When he is struggling as bad as he is, there has to be other underlying reasons," Neville said on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football.</p>

      <p>"The board, I believe, are massively split. They have seen what happened with United, who are no further forward since sacking David Moyes.</p>
      <p>"They will have looked at other clubs who have had success since making a change.</p>
      <p>"My view, when you are in that position as a board, is you don't make a decision. You let things play out until a time comes by you are certain about what you are doing."</p>

      <p>Fellow pundit Jamie Carragher insisted Arsenal fans want Emery gone, because they fear they will miss out on possible replacements.</p>
      <p>He added: "Unai Emery has not adapted. He has created confusion with the crowd, his players and himself.</p>
      <p>"Arsenal fans look back and realised they missed out on two of the best managers in the world, because they stuck with Arsene Wenger for too long.</p>
      <p>"That is where the resentment comes from because they don't want to miss out again."</p>
