      <h1>Center Parcs Ireland: Quiet Longford town now booming thanks to new holiday resort</h1>
      <h2>It gave us Maura Higgins – the Queen of Love Island – and now it’s vying for the crown of fastest-growing town in the Midlands</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:58:40+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:58</time> by <a rel="author">Michelle Fleming</a></address>
      <p>Eileen McLoughlin loves to sit out on her front porch at lunchtimes on Mondays and Fridays and watch the Mullingar Road burst into life.</p>
      <p>And for those few hours, to her eyes, the buzz is more Manhattan than Ballymahon.</p>
      <p>Twenty years ago kids could play football on this Co Longford town’s Main Street.</p>
      <p>These days you’re lucky to find a parking space. Welcome to Boomtown.</p>
      <p>Eileen, 77, said: “I sit on my porch on a Friday and the crowds and traffic is unreal, and you know where they’re going with all the bikes on the back.”</p>
      <p>Once a sleepy corner of Longford – the forgotten county that often came last in the tourist league tables – Ballymahon is having one heck of a moment.</p>
      <p>It gave us Maura Higgins – the Queen of Love Island – and now it’s vying for the crown of fastest-growing town in the Midlands.</p>

      <p>On a drizzly Wednesday afternoon, workers in high-vis jackets are busy digging roads so they can lay pipes to pump natural gas from the junction at Athlone Road up to homes and businesses along Main Street.</p>
      <p>It will save locals a fortune. There are roadworks also underway on the R312 Mullingar Road.</p>
      <p>The new €8.5million ESB power station nearby will bring back the workers to put down the power-lines, when the roads and paths will also get a spanking new upgrade.</p>
      <p>Locals have been waiting patiently for the White Bridge over the River Inny in nearby Newcastle Woods to be reinstated since 1963.</p>
      <p>And yesterday those of a certain vintage crossed the gorgeous white latticework iron footbridge for the first time in 56 years.</p>
      <p>Another €1million has been spent by Longford County Council renovating the Royal Canal Greenway.</p>

      <p>Soon cyclists and walkers will bego all the way from Dublin’s <br/>Docklands to Ballymahon.</p>
      <p>It will eventually extend into Roscommon, and hook into Westport’s Greenway, heading out towards Achill. It will be the longest off-road cycle route in Europe – with Ballymahon bang in the middle of it.</p>
      <p>Just five years ago, all of this would have seemed like a pretty wacky dream.</p>
      <p>But that was before the €233million Center Parcs juggernaut came to town.</p>
      <p>The 395-acre Center Parcs Longford Forest has been transformed this week into a glittering Winter Wonderland.</p>
      <p>But the twinkly lights are well hidden from mere mortals behind 24-hour security posts, fences and thick conifer canopies around the periphery of the resort, 4km outside the town.</p>
      <p>Locals who hadn’t been able to find a job since the days Manford Clothing’s suits and overcoats – Longford’s answer to Magee’s of Donegal, which closed in 1989 with the loss of 200 jobs – have swapped hellish commutes for a job that gets <br/>them home in time for tea.</p>
      <p>Most of the 1,000 jobs at Center Parcs went to locals, with others bussed in on a fleet of local coaches from outlying towns such as Longford and Mullingar.</p>

      <p>On Mondays and Fridays – changeover day at the resort – 400 housekeepers are bussed in. And Main Street is choc-a-block.</p>
      <p>Peter Dennehy, a third generation mechanic at Finnegan’s Garage, said: “Center Parcs has been the catalyst for a lot of things that would never, ever have happened – and soon we’ll be the Westport of the Midlands.”</p>
      <p>Everywhere you look, Main Street is hopping.</p>
      <p>There’s a new Fallon &amp; Byrne-style cafe and gift store, Diffley’s DIY is doing a roaring trade in wellies and outdoor gear, while Hailo and Occasions hairdressers have bookings for Communion parties at Center Parcs next year.</p>
      <p>SuperValu is expanding with a new car park being built out the back.</p>
      <p>In a warehouse a little out the road, local Sean Colohan and his French wife Carla Nattchayan are living their dream making beer in their year-old Wide Street Brewing Company.</p>
      <p>It’s a hit with craft buffs in Dublin’s hipster Stoneybatter.</p>
      <p>Savvy investors were keen to back the couple, given their location a few miles from Center Parcs, and they’ve plans to open a visitor centre.</p>

      <p>Cooneys Hotel has never been busier – part in thanks to the 10.30pm last orders at the resort’s bars.</p>
      <p>And it’s not just the estimated 2,500 holiday-makers who are coming and going every Monday and Friday who are doing the splurging.</p>
      <p>There’s also the €27million in wages flooding into the local economy.</p>
      <p>Eileen is getting her perm done in Occasions.</p>
      <p>She said: “My daughter-in-law, her daughter, my grandson and his mother all work there and they love it.” Father-of-five Paddy Diffley, of Diffleys DIY, is rethinking his stock to suit the holiday crowd.</p>
      <p>He said: “I didn’t think there would be such a big move on wellies and the wetsuits for the kids so we’ll be getting in a lot more of that.</p>
      <p>“It’s all a bit late for me though. I’m here since 1973 and it’s almost time to be getting out.”</p>
      <p>But – in Paddy’s favour – it’s never been a better time to sell.</p>
      <p>Property prices in the town – in a county lumbered with ghost estates not so long ago – are surging.</p>
      <p>In 18 months, one estate agent sold the same apartment for €20,000, €40,000 and €60,000.</p>
      <p>John Byrne has happy memories as a small boy helping his late father Charlie at his block plant Readymix on the Edgeworthstown Road.</p>
      <p>But in 1983, the recession forced Charlie to close.</p>
      <p>Then, in September 2015 – five months after Center Parcs announced it was coming to Ballymahon – John bought back his dad’s old site.</p>
      <p>He’d had enough of the 2.5-hour daily commute to Vodafone in <br/>Sandyford. The arrival of Center Parcs’ made up his mind and his dad’s old site had just been put on the market.</p>
      <p>Since then his logistics and distribution company Droplink has grown its workforce with 40 more staff.</p>
      <p>Sadly Charlie, who died in 2001, never got to see his son buy back his old site.</p>
      <p>John said: “My dad struggled so hard building his business from <br/>the ground up and it was tough for him to lose it. He’d be so delighted – over the moon – to see me back here.”</p>
      <p>And according to Peter Dennehy, this is just the start of it.</p>
      <p>He said: “When we were growing up there were kids in every house in the Main Street.</p>
      <p>“Now there are just three kids and two are mine.</p>
      <p>“But that’s all about to flip back again. Soon they’ll all be back.”</p>
