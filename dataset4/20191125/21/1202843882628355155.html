      <p>Doha:  The Public Works Authority Ashghal continues working round the clock to facilitate public access to the stadiums of 24th Arabian Gulf Cup - Qatar 2019, scheduled to kick off on Tuesday, November 26, 2019.</p>
      <p>Ashghal has escalated its performance level to the fullest executing all the tasks required to ensure safety of road users and spectators and to improve smooth traffic flow on road network around the three main venues of the tournament - Khalifa International Stadium, Abdullah bin Khalifa Stadium (Al Duhail) and Al Janoub Stadium.</p>
      <p>A study was carried out on road closures, traffic diversions and alternative road plans to facilitate the movement of individuals and vehicles during the tournament. All the necessary operational and emergency response plans have been completed and four teams are ready and equipped with the necessary machineries. In addition, emergency test scenarios and rapid intervention plan have been carried out.</p>
      <p>Since August 2019, ROM department started to survey, study and test all available road assets around the stadium such as asphalt condition, directional signs, safety barriers, drainage assets, street lighting, pedestrian crossing, tunnels, and traffic signals. All the road projects being implemented around the stadium were inspected, surveyed and refurbished to ensure their readiness 4to use during the event.</p>
      <p>Ashghals Roads Operation and Maintenance (ROM) team is working around the clock to facilitate the traffic management on the roads surrounding Khalifa International Stadium, and the main entrances and exits by installing more than 100 directional signs to guide the public to the parking lots based on their categories.</p>
      <p>In addition, Ashghal is using the dynamic signs to inform road users about the roads status and the event updates.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Ashghal worked in coordination with the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy on a number of maps to be published on social media to guide road-users and spectators to the designated parking lots for each stadium, with the help of directional signs for public coming from different destinations, as Salwa Road, Muaither, South or Al Huwar.</p>
      <p>Through the Roads Management Centre, Ashghal continues to monitor the road network round the clock to ensure that the roads surrounding the stadium are free of obstacles and to ensure smooth traffic flow.</p>
      <p>To ensure the safety of pedestrians, a green fencing has been installed on Al Waab Street, to encourage pedestrians to use the pedestrian tunnel of Sports city metro station and cross the main road safely.</p>
      <p>In addition, a series of routine explorations and tests were carried out at various locations round the clock during the days before the event to monitor the work developments required to ensure the success of the tournament.</p>
      <p>Abdullah bin Khalifa Stadium or (Al Duhail Stadium) during the week before the start of the Arabian Gulf Cup, Ashghal installed more than 60 directional signs on the roads surrounding Duhail Stadium to direct fans from different destinations to the stadium's parking lots.</p>
      <p>Converting Al Tarfa Roundabout project (known as Golf Club Roundabout) into a signal-controlled intersection has improved traffic flow and increased the capacity of the intersection, while providing easy access to Abdullah bin Khalifa Stadium.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the three graded levels signalised Izghawa intersection now provides an ideal route to the stadium for the masses coming from Doha or North. The intersection also provides better access to local roads as well as alleviates traffic congestions at the north side of Doha Golf Club, West Bay, Legtaifiya, Al Khor Expressway and the north-western side of Lusail Development Project, in addition to providing local roads access to the area surrounding the stadium.</p>
      <p>While for Al Janoub Stadium Ashghal has delivered a number of local roads, expressways and various infrastructure projects that serve Al Janoub Stadium facilities, in addition to developing new roads and upgrading existing roads to facilitate access to the stadium and its facilities.</p>
      <p>The Southern Part of the Doha Express Highway project is considered one of the most important roads that directly connect to the stadium though Al Wukair Interchange, as it connects with Doha Expressway, Sabah Al Ahmad Corridor and G Ring Road on one end, and with Al Wukair Road, Mesaieed Road and Al Wakra Main Road on the other end.</p>
      <p>This is in addition to the development of part of Al Wukair Road, which included an increase in the number of lanes from two to four lanes and the installation of traffic signals in the area between Al Wakra Hospital and Al Wukair Roads intersection with Doha Expressway. The works done on the road facilitates the movement of traffic in the area and provides additional exits and entrances to the stadium,</p>
      <p>In order to facilitate the fan commute from Al Wakrah Metro Station to Al Janoub Stadium, Ashghal has implemented 3.5 km long pedestrian and cycling tracks extending from Al Wakra metro station to the stadium, starting from Al Wakrah Street to pass through Najma Street extension and Al Wukair Road. The implementation of these tracks aims to enhance the movement and transportation of visitors and fans during the event.</p>
