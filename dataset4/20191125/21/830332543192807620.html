      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Green Bean casserole made with canned soup and fried onions is an old traditional favorite.</p>
      <p>Try this recipe if you would like to make it homemade. The sauce is SO good.</p>
      <p>The mushroom sauce can be made ahead. Freeze or refrigerate until ready to bake. </p>
      <p>Baked Fried Onions - optional</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>3/4 cup Panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mushroom Sauce</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>4 ounces fresh mushroom, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
        <li>1 cup fat-free chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup skim milk, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Dash white pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dry sherry, optional</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Green Beans</li>
        <li>3 cans (15 ounces each) cut green beans, drained</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Baked Fried Onions optional- Preheat oven to 475 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix chopped onions with a beaten egg. Place Panko bread crumbs in a shallow bowl. Add onions and toss until well coated. Evenly spread onions on baking pan. Bake for 15 - 20 minutes or until golden brown and crisp. Toss them with a spatula every 5 minutes. Remove from oven and coarsely crumble them. Sprinkle with salt. Turn oven down to 350 degrees. </p>
      <h3>Mushroom Sauce </h3>
      <p>In a medium sized heavy saucepan, melt 1/2 tablespoon of butter. Add finely chopped mushrooms. (It works best to chop them in a small food processor.) Cook over medium heat stirring frequently until mushrooms are tender and most of the moisture has been absorbed. Place mushroom in a bowl and set aside. Add 3 tablespoon of butter to the pan. Melt the butter.</p>
      <p>Add flour and stir constantly over medium heat until mixture is bubbly.</p>
      <p>Add chicken broth and continue to stir constantly until mixture boils and thickens.</p>
      <p>Add 1/4 cup milk, cheese, white pepper, sherry, and reserved mushrooms. Add salt and pepper to taste.</p>
      <h3>Beans </h3>
      <p>Place canned beans in a casserole dish. Add desired amount of sauce. This can be made ahead at this point. Add extra milk if sauce is too thick. Cover and refrigerated until ready to bake.</p>
      <p>Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes or until heated through. Top with crumbled breaded onions or canned fried onions if desired. Place in oven and bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
