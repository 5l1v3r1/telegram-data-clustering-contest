      <h1>Cyber Insurance Upsurge Fueled By Breaches, Fines</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:02:59+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>As data breaches and ransomware hacks escalate, cyber protection is becoming one of the fastest-growing insurance industry sectors, a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/751946b2-fb0a-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6">Financial Times</a> special report indicated.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/sayata-smb-cyber-insurance/">cyber insurance</a> sector expected to reach a $7.5 billion valuation by the end of the decade, with small medium-sized businesses (SMBs) a rising customer demographic.</p>
      <p>Following high-profile cyberattacks two years ago at <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/security-and-risk/2017/wannacry-leaves-researchers-with-big-questions/">WannaCry</a> and <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/the-cybersecurity-juggling-act-of-buyer-supplier-connectivity/">NotPetya</a>, many companies became certain protection was necessary because data breaches are often pricey.</p>
      <p>A 2014 breach at Marriott, for example, cost the chain over $100 million before fines were levied under EU rules. The company’s insurance policies have paid out $102 million.</p>
      <p>“NotPetya was a huge trigger for buying outside the U.S. as [companies] saw what business interruption really looks like,” said Sarah Stephens, the cyber, media and technology practice leader at insurance broker Marsh JLT Specialty.</p>
      <p>Insurance companies are eyeing the cyber market as “a rare opportunity for growth.” The global market in annual premiums is forecasted to soar to $15 billion by 2022 from its current $6 billion, according to RBC Capital Markets.</p>
      <p>The U.S. most recently led the industry’s growth, but the trend is expanding to Europe. GDPR rules are anticipated to trigger a surge of penalties.</p>
      <p>SMBs are another big growth sector for the cyber insurance industry.</p>
      <p>“We are seeing more and more take-up, particularly in industries where we see a data breach risk, such as retailers, healthcare, anyone dealing with data analytics and companies that work with big, global firms,” Stephens said.</p>
      <p>Aside from payouts to cover losses after an attack, cyber insurance also has a service element to assist customers with hacked systems. Services offered include forensic investigators, public relations experts and expert negotiators to deal with ransom demands.</p>
      <p>“Cyber modeling is still very much in its infancy,” said Rebecca Bole, head of Industry Engagement at CyberCube, a cyber modeling specialist. “It is a very different peril to weather-related perils, where the science is documented and well understood. Cyber is a man-made peril, which creates a lot of complexity.”</p>
