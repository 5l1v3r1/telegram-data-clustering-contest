      <h3>How to calculate your daily number?</h3>
      <p>One of the most prominent numerological calculations you will benefit from is your daily number. It is a pretty simple equation that you can do for yourself regularly. All you need to do is reduce, and for this calculation, you will need the current date, month and year as well as your birth date, and birth month. First, you will have to reduce all dates into master numbers (Master Number: any number reduced to single digits using addition). Then you will sum up all the master numbers. The final master number that remains is your daily number. For example, if you were born on August 18, and wanted to know the daily number for November 24, 2019, you would calculate as follows:</p>
      <h4>Birth Month: August is the eighth month of the year. 8 reduces to 8. It is already a single digit master number.</h4>
      <h4>Birth Date: The date of birth is 18. 18 reduces to 9 (1+8 = 9)</h4>
      <h4>Current Month: November is the 11th month. 11 is reduced to 1 (1+1 = 2)</h4>
      <h4>Current Date: The date is 24, which reduces to 7 (2+4 = 6)</h4>
      <h4>Current Year: The year is 2019, which reduces to 3 (2+0+1+9 = 12 which then reduces to 1+2 = 3)</h4>
      <h4>Daily number = adding all the master numbers 8+9+2+6+3 = 28 which is then further reduced to 2+8 = 10 which will be then reduced to 1 (1+0 = 1) as the daily number.</h4>
