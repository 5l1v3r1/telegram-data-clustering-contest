      <p>After a rough few months in the wild, Ubisoft is reworking the customization process for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/franchise/ghost-recon/609"><i>Ghost Recon</i></a><i> Breakpoint</i>.</p>
      <p>In the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostRecon/comments/e1jfwz/tom_clancys_ghost_recon_breakpoint_title_update/">studio’s upcoming patch</a>, update 1.0.3.1, players can customize their Ghost at anytime — specifically by changing their gender or face mid-game. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostRecon/comments/e1jfwz/tom_clancys_ghost_recon_breakpoint_title_update/">reddit post detailing its patch</a>, Ubisoft clarified that it wants to players to have more customization options in the game, which includes the freedom to swap more concrete things like a character’s physical characteristics.</p>

      <p>As part of this update, players also have more customization options available to them from the start. The studio now offers players 40 more items to build an outfit with by default. Previously, players needed to find these items in the world or purchase them with the Skell Credits currency. It’s currently unclear if players who’ve already purchased these items will see any kind of kick-back reward from Ubisoft. We’ve reached out to Ubisoft for clarification.</p>
      <p>This update — which also includes a load of bug fixes — will hit live servers on Nov. 26 at 4 p.m. EST.</p>
