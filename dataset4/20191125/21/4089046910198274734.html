      <p>THP announced the seventh annual "I-40 Challenge" on Monday.</p>
      <p>Fifty-five million people are expected to take to the road and skies for travel this Thanksgiving, AAA <a href="https://www.wvlt.tv/content/news/55-million-travelers-will-take-to-the-roads-and-skies-this-Thanksgiving-565430612.html">reported</a>. Most of those people, 49.3 million, will be driving.</p>
      <p>The busiest days for travel will be on Tuesday and Wednesday, the report added. The I-40 challenge will have troopers out along the highway from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Wednesday and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.</p>
      <p>“The loss of life is never easy, especially when that loss could have been avoided,” Colonel Dereck R. Stewart said. “The pain remains for a lifetime. That is why I am making a commitment to increase our<br/>trooper presence not only on the I-40 corridor, but on all major Tennessee roadways. We encourage the public to make safe choices when traveling on our Tennessee roadways. Stay off your phone and<br/>don’t drive distracted, wear your seatbelt, and do not drive impaired.”</p>
      <p>THP offered traffic data from the 2018 Thanksgiving holiday and said that there were 44 crashes on that Wednesday before Thanksgiving and 55 on that Sunday after.</p>
