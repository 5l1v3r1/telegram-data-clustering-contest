      <h1>Michelin star chef sacked from Mayfair hotel after hosting private party for friends when restaurant was closed</h1>

      <p>A Michelin-starred chef has been abruptly sacked from a Mayfair hotel after hosting a party for his friends when the restaurant was shut.</p>
      <p>Alyn Williams worked at the restaurant which bears his name in the Westbury, West London, before shocking the culinary world by announcing his departure yesterday.</p>
      <p>He claims that he was sacked for gross misconduct after inviting friends to the restaurant on a Sunday lunchtime when it was closed.</p>
      <p>Mr Williams said he was let go without notice or compensation after having an appeal rejected for using the restaurant without permission.</p>
      <p>The chef claims that all food and drink had been supplied by him and that there was no damage or loss.</p>
      <p>He said: “I am understandably very upset and disappointed with the dismissal under these circumstances particularly since I have been employed by the hotel for the past eight years.</p>
      <p>"I have had an exemplary employment record and was responsible, through the restaurant, for bringing prestige to the hotel, achieving a Michelin star which we maintained for eight successive years and four AA rosettes for five successive years.”</p>
      <p>Alyn Williams at the Westbury opened in 2011 and won a Michelin star two years later.</p>
      <p>Other restaurateurs and chefs have tweeted their shock at his dismissal.</p>
      <p>Aidan McGee, the head chef at Corrigan's in Mayfair, said: "There lost one of the great chefs in London and England and all round nice guy truly shocking".</p>
      <p>Another Mayfair neighbour, Oisín Rogers, who runs The Guinea Grill steakhouse, added: "Lovely man and decent, I wish him well".</p>
      <p>Some said it was a poor business decision. John Abbey, head chef at The Abbott's Elm in Huntingdon said: "That seems both a huge over reaction and a terrible business decision. Unless there’s more to it.</p>
      <p>"Alyn Williams will succeed wherever he goes. The Westbury have a big job on their hands now."</p>
      <p>The chef has asked the restaurant to rename itself so it no longer gives the impression he works there, and to take his name off the website and from promotional marketing.</p>
      <p>The Westbury has been contacted for comment.</p>
