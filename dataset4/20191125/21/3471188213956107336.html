      <h1>Google Keep is getting an update that includes a Floating Action Button</h1>

      <p>Keep is a forgotten gem of the Google suite of apps. It’s simple to use and highly functional, but as a result of that simplicity – doesn’t seem to see a lot of love from the team behind the scenes. The update that is currently rolling out to users includes a Material themed bottom bar, including the Floating Action Button (FAB).</p>
      <p>This brings Keep into line with other apps in their suite including Calendar, Gmail, Drive, Sheets and Docs that already have the FAB included in the UI. While the update is yet to appear on my devices as it’s a server side update, the screenshots show a couple of nice little changes. The bottom bar remains docked, but the FAB removes the “take a note” text.</p>

      <p>It’s a tiny tweak but it will make a notable difference, further simplifying the look and feel of the app.</p>
