      <p>According to reports, <a href="https://www.sohh.com/french-montana-rushed-to-hospital-after-possible-medical-scare/">Montana was hospitalized</a> last Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <blockquote>A Public Information Officer with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department confirms to PEOPLE that deputies responded to the rapper’s Calabasas home just before 1:30 p.m. for a medical call. After arriving at the scene, French, 35, was transported to a hospital, but the LACSD officer could not disclose what he was treated for or where he was taken. (People)</blockquote>
      <p>French is <a href="https://www.sohh.com/french-montana-rushed-to-hospital-after-possible-medical-scare/">reportedly on the road to recovery</a> following the medical scare.</p>
      <blockquote>Despite the alarming hospitalization, we’re told French is awake and alert. He is currently undergoing treatment and is expected to be released sometime later Thursday. (E! News)</blockquote>
      <p>Some media outlets speculated <a href="https://www.sohh.com/french-montana-rushed-to-hospital-after-possible-medical-scare/">what could have ultimately</a> caused the hospitalization.</p>
      <blockquote>Our sources say French has been traveling a lot over the last couple of weeks — including trips to the Middle East and Europe. We’re told some around him suspect he could have been exposed to contaminated food. (TMZ)</blockquote>
