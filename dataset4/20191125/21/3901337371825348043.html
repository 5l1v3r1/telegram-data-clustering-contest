      <p>Speaking in an interview with <i>El Pais</i> recently, Dybala revealed that his friends had mocked his bad luck for having to compete with arguably the best players in the world, but he insisted he sees it as a learning opportunity rather than a challenge.</p>
      <p>"My friends used to say that I had Messi in the national team, and then Juve went and signed Cristiano, but I said they were wrong," Dybala said.</p>
      <p>"Who doesn't want to play with the best? I can study them every day. We're talking about two phenomenons. Two players who are two steps above anyone else."</p>

      <p>The former Palermo forward also stated that he enjoys a good relationship with both players, despite competing for a position with them. </p>
      <p>"I have good vibes with Cristiano. We talk a lot, sometimes we chat for a long time, about the national team, Juve, but also about things that have nothing to do with football," he added.</p>
      <p>"... And, with Leo, too. The relationship has grown a lot. We share <i>mate</i> (a caffeine-rich drink) afternoons and we have a group where we play trick in the room."</p>
