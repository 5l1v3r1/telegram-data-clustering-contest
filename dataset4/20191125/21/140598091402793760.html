      <h1>Nicola Sturgeon attacked over 'delusional' independence plan after difficult Andrew Neil interview</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:11:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/simon-johnson/" target="_blank">Simon Johnson</a></address>
      <p>Nicola Sturgeon has been called "delusional" after arguing Scotland should leave the UK market where it sends more than 60 per cent of its exports and "quickly" join the EU.</p>
      <p>In a car crash interview with the BBC's Andrew Neil, the First Minister repeatedly refused to accept it was illogical to argue that Brexit would cost tens of thousands of Scottish jobs but leaving the UK would not carry a heavier economic cost.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/10/15/snp-working-blueprint-avoid-separate-scotland-hard-border-england/">Scotland could face a hard border with England</a> if it was in the EU and the rest of the UK outside, but Ms Sturgeon said the full implications will only be known once a post-Brexit trade deal is agreed.</p>
      <p>She argued that it is in Scotland's interests to stay part of an EU single market "that is eight times the size of the UK market" in terms of population, despite Scottish companies trading far more with the latter.</p>
      <p>The First Minister insisted a separate Scotland would be welcomed into the European Union "relatively" quickly while being able to use the currency of a non-EU state, the pound.</p>

      <p>However, she failed to provide any detail on how Scotland would cut its huge deficit to the three per cent required by the EU, while raising the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/05/23/snp-trying-fool-public-separate-scottish-currency-would-pegged/">tens of billions of pounds of currency reserves </a>it would require.</p>
      <p>Ms Sturgeon also struggled to defend her government's health record amid a slew of missed waiting times targets and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/22/glasgow-health-board-placed-special-measures-child-deaths/">the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital scandal.</a></p>
      <p>Mr Neil said: "You’ve called for legislation to protect the NHS from Donald Trump. Maybe the NHS needs legislation to protect it from Nicola Sturgeon?"</p>
      <p>Ms Sturgeon's lacklustre performance prompted a flood of comments on social media, with Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Tory leader, saying she had received "a doing on the hypocrisy of her Brexit vs Indy position and a doing over her domestic record in health."</p>
      <p>Paul Masterton, the Scottish Tory candidate in East Renfrewshire, said: "The reason the First Minister can't give a timetable on what might happen to Scotland after independence is because the SNP doesn't know what will happen. Yet still she insists we must have another referendum next year."</p>
      <p>Pamela Nash, the chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: "These deluded claims from Nicola Sturgeon are an attempt to mislead voters. It would also almost certainly lead to a hard border with England, with massive economic and social consequences."</p>
      <p>Mr Neil pressed Ms Sturgeon on how she could cite research claiming Brexit could cost Scotland 80,000 jobs while "independence would create no trade friction with the UK, no job losses, no loss of living standards, nothing to see here, just move on."</p>
      <p>The First Minister said EU membership had diversified the Republic of Ireland's export base and pointed out "we don’t yet know what the UK’s final relationship with the EU" will be.</p>

      <p>She said: "When we have clarity on that, we have to understand those implications and we have to set out clearly how we deal with those implications in order to keep trade flowing between Scotland and England which<a href="https://chase.telegraph.co.uk/etc/telegraph-author/index.html#">Google Maps </a>is in our interests and in the interests of the rest of the UK."</p>
      <p>Challenged on whether Scotland could join the EU while using the currency of a non-member state, Ms Sturgeon said this was possible.</p>
      <p>The First Minister added: "We would have a discussion with the EU about the journey an independent Scotland was on in terms of currency, and the accession if Scotland was already out of the EU to the point where we rejoined the EU."</p>
