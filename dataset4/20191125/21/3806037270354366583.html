      <p>Towards the beginning of this month, <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/jack-harlow">Jack Harlow</a> shared a <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/jack-harlow-warsaw-music-video-confetti-stream">music video for “WARSAW,”</a> a highlight of his most recent studio project, <i>Confetti</i>. Now, continuing to support the aforementioned album, the Louisville artist is back with another new visual in support of one of <i>Confetti</i>‘s standout selections, “RIVER ROAD” — a song named after a prominent street in Harlow’s hometown.</p>
      <p>“The best thing ever is when you make something hot,” Jack Harlow shared with us during a <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/jack-harlow-conversations-with-interview-video">recent edition</a> of our <i>Conversations With</i> interview series. “It feels so good to make some fly shit. You just be feeling it, and you made it. It’s like God gave you a divine purpose in that moment.”</p>
      <p>“That’s one of the most inspiring things — to do shows or go to shows,” Jack Harlow added “Watch how it’s moving the people, cause you know it’s interesting for me is my music has more of a bounce to it. You gotta dance to a lot of it … Me personally, I like the smoother shit.”</p>
