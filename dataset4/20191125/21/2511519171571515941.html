      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> is no longer the artist with the most <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/american-music-awards">American Music Awards</a> to his name.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a> beat the late singer during Sunday’s ceremony, during which she picked up six new awards.</p>
      <p>This brings her total to 29, surpassing Jackson’s 24 wins.</p>
      <p>Swift notably won the Artist of the Year award on Sunday, as well as Favourite Pop/Rock Album.</p>
      <p>The latter was the one that enabled her to initially tie with Jackson before scoring additional wins.</p>
      <p>Swift performed a medley of her hits before accepting the Artist of the Decade award, which came amid her <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/american-music-awards-taylor-swift-amas-scooter-braun-scott-borchetta-amas-a9216416.html">ongoing conflict with music executive Scooter Braun</a>.</p>
      <p>The singer said the last year had “the most amazing times and some of the hardest things I have gone through in my life,” but that she felt lucky.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, she also collected the Favourite Music Video, Favourite Pop/Rock Female Artist, and Favourite Adult Contemporary Artist awards.</p>
      <p>Swift won her first American Music Award in 2008 and collected more trophies in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2018.</p>
