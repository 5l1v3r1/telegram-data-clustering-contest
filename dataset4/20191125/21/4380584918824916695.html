      <h1>Zunino, Rays reach new 1-year, $4.5M deal</h1>

      <p>ST. PETERSBURG -- With the catcher market starting to take shape, the Rays decided to work on a new deal with catcher Mike Zunino that will keep him in Tampa Bay through the 2020 season.</p>
      <p>After a disappointing season at the plate in 2019, Zunino became a possible candidate to be non-tendered before the Dec. 2 deadline, but instead the Rays showed confidence in the veteran catcher, and they finalized a one-year deal for $4.5 million on Monday.</p>
      <p>The deal includes a 2021 club option worth another $4.5 million, with the potential to grow to $5.25 million with incentives. That gives the Rays the ability to bank on Zunino having a bounce-back season at the plate, while also maintaining control for one more year if the 28-year-old shows consistent improvement with his bat.</p>
      <p>Zunino hit just nine home runs in 90 games with the Rays, and his batting average dipped to .165. The .544 OPS was the second lowest of his career, behind the .530 clip in 2015 as a member of the Mariners.</p>
      <p>Despite the offensive struggles, Zunino was still able to showcase his exit velocity, which is one of the areas that appealed to the Rays last offseason when they acquired the catcher from the Mariners. Zunino finished with an 88.4 average exit velocity, which was lower than the 89.5 clip in 2018 but a solid number nevertheless.</p>
      <p>While most of the attention surrounded Zunino’s production at the plate, bringing back the catcher gives the Rays a veteran player who can still provide elite-level defense. Even in a down year, Zunino’s pop time finished in the 73rd percentile and his framing was good enough to land in the 61st percentile.</p>
      <p>His presence behind the plate is also something that brings value to the Rays. Zunino knows the pitching staff, and they have raved about the leadership he brings.</p>
      <p>With Zunino secured, it’s still likely that the Rays will look at the trade or free-agent market to improve at the position. Tampa Bay has Michael Perez on the roster, but he doesn’t have much Major League experience and could start the season in Triple-A Durham as a quality depth piece at the position.</p>
