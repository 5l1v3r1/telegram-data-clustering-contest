      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:50:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:50</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Arnold</a></address>
      <h3>Mexican clubs seeking Chilean star's signature</h3>
      <p>Three Mexican clubs are looking to sign Chilean forward Ignacio Jeraldino from Aduax Italiano, his agent said.</p>
      <p>A report earlier this fall said America, Pachuca and Cruz Azul all were interested in "Jeraldios," but Sergio Morales told reporters Cruz Azul is not one of the clubs with whom he has had contact. The player also reportedly has generated looks from clubs inSpain and Italy.</p>
      <h3>Gallito may land with Cruz Azul</h3>
      <p>Cruz Azul manager Robert Dante Siboldi has said thatreports the club has interest in reuniting him with Santos Laguna midfielder Jose Juan "Gallito" Vazquez are accurate, with the 31-year-old one of the players <a href="https://www.record.com.mx/futbol-liga-mx-cruz-azul/siboldi-gallito-vazquez-esta-en-la-baraja-de-posibilidades-de-refuerzos">'in the deck'</a> for La Maquina.</p>
      <p>The manager was less definitive about the future of veteran goalkeeper Jesus Corona. The 38-year-old has been a fixture at the Mexico City club but reports came out this week that Cruz Azul may bring in a younger shot-stopper to replace him.</p>
      <h3>Chivas exit Fabian chase</h3>
      <p>Marco Fabian was originally on Chivas' offseason target list, but the Guadalajara side is set to move on, according to <i><a href="https://www.tudn.com/futbol/liga-mx/china-y-tigres-los-rivales-de-chivas-para-fichar-sus-primeros-refuerzos">TUDN</a> .</i></p>
      <p>There isinterest from clubs in China, MLS and other Liga MX clubs in the midfielder, most recently with thePhiladelphia Union.</p>
      <h3>Gudino could make Europe return</h3>
      <p>Chivas goalkeeper Raul Gudino has lost his starting spot at Chivas and may make his return to Europe in the winter, according to <i><a href="https://www.marca.com/claro-mx/futbol/guadalajara/2019/11/18/5dd1956222601d0d098b45a1.html">Marca</a> .</i></p>
      <p>One team in Belgium and another in the Netherlands has shown interest in the 23-year-old who returned to Mexico after stints in Porto's youth system and withAPOEL in Cyprus.</p>
      <h3>U-17 success leads to offers from Europe</h3>
      <p>After a run to the final of the Under-17 World Cup, three Mexican players already have offers from European teams, according to <i><a href="https://www.tudn.com/futbol/tres-jugadores-del-tri-sub-17-tienen-propuestas-de-europa-video">TUDN</a> .</i></p>
      <p>The television network reports Atlas defender Alejandro Gomez is getting interest from European teams, with clubs in France, Italy and England expressing interest in the left-footed player.Eugenio Pizzuto, the Pachuca midfielder who won the bronze ball, and Santos Laguna forward Santiago Munoz also are candidates to move abroad.</p>
      <h3>Victor Guzman set for Chivas move</h3>
      <p>Victor Guzman will join Chivas ahead of the 2020 Clausura, according to <i>MedioTiempo.</i></p>
      <p>The former Chivas youth player will look to make his first-team debut next year after a successful stint with Pachuca. His current teammate Erick Aguirre also will arive, with both players waiting only on the final sign off from new sporting directorRicardo Pelaez.</p>
      <p>Tuzos sporting director Marco Garces told <i><a href="https://www.tudn.mx/liga-mx/futuro-de-victor-guzman-estaria-en-chivas-o-europa">TUDN</a>  </i> that the club would be listening to offers for the 24-year-old.</p>
      <h3>Pulido drawing MLS interest</h3>
      <p>Chivas forward Alan Pulido's season, which has seen the forward secure theLiga MX scoring title, has drawn the attention of a team in MLS, according to <i><a href="https://www.informador.mx/deportes/Pulido-acecha-el-titulo-de-goleo-20191112-0033.html">El Informador</a> .</i></p>
      <p>A team in MLS is looking to woo the 28-year-old with an offer to make him a designated player.</p>
      <h3>Sebastian Jurado set for Tigres move</h3>
      <p>Veracruz will look to sell promising goalkeeper Sebastian Jurado in 2020with Tigres a top suitor, according to <i><a href="https://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/fut-al-horno/veracruz-sebastian-jurado-emigrar-tigres-2020">MedioTiempo</a> .</i></p>
      <p>The 22-year-old could leave in the winter or summer, with the Tiburones Rojos willing to accept a fee in the $6 million range.</p>
      <h3>Veracruz in risk of removal</h3>
      <p>Liga MX club owners will meet December 3, with removing Veracruz from the league one of the topics set to be discussed, according to <a href="https://www.foxsports.com.mx/news/431264-veracruz-directo-a-la-desafiliacion-mira-la-charla-que-tendran-duenos"><i>Fox Deportes.</i></a></p>
      <p>While on the field, the club recently snapped a 41-match winless run that extended a year and two months, things off the field continue to be poor. After players nearly went on strike because of unpaid wages, several are simply leaving the team after getting their back-pay.</p>
      <p>While the owners let Veracruz back in after the club should've been relegated in the summer, they now may have had enough and could play the Clausura with 18 clubs.</p>
      <h3>Rafa Puente Jr. to return to bench</h3>
      <p>Rafa Puente Jr., former manager of Lobos BUAP and Queretaro, is a candidate for a number of coaching jobs.</p>
      <p>He has been contacted by Roberto Nanni, the sporting director ofCerro Porteno, about taking over theParaguayan club next year, according to <i><a href="https://d10.ultimahora.com/el-dt-que-suena-barrio-obrero-n2851142.html">D10</a> .</i> <i><a href="https://www.espn.com.mx/futbol/mexico/nota/_/id/6243523/prensa-rafael-puente-opcion-para-cerro-porteno-en-paraguay">ESPN Mexico</a></i> reportsthe 40-year-old isnew Chivas director Ricardo Pelaez's second option should Diego Alonso not agree to take over the Rebano Sagrado.</p>
      <h3>Antuna has interest in Portugal</h3>
      <p>Mexico national teamwinger Uriel Antuna has interest from Benfica and Sporting in Portugal, according to <i><a href="https://www.marca.com/claro-mx/futbol/mercado-de-fichajes/2019/10/24/5db2001fca4741ab7f8b461d.html">Marca</a> .</i></p>
      <p>The 22-year-old spent last season with the LA Galaxy,on loan from Manchester City, but is agreeing to a new contract with City and wants to return to Europe. Antuna previously was loaned out toGroningen but saw little game time in the Netherlands. He also has heavily been linked with Chivas.</p>
      <h3>Mexican ownership group out on Newcastle after meeting</h3>
      <p>A pair of Mexican businessmen met Newcastle owner Mike Ashley last week in London about purchasing the Premier League club but left unimpressed, according to <i><a href="https://theathletic.com/1307781/2019/10/21/ornstein-on-monday-man-utd-maddison-ashley-mexican-takeover-talks/">The Athletic</a> .</i></p>
      <p>Alejandro Irarragorri, of Grupo Orlegi which owns Santos Laguna and Atlas, reportedly was interested in purchasing the Magpies this summer. He also was in London this month to speak at the annual Leaders conference, but it is unclear if Ashley met withIrarragorri and his partners or a different group.</p>
      <h3>Castellanos' future may be in Mexico</h3>
      <p>New York City's Argentine attacker Valentin Castellanos is on the radar of several Liga MX clubs, according to <i><a href="https://theathletic.com/1283482/2019/10/10/">The Athletic</a> .</i></p>
      <p>After scoring 11 goals for NYCFC in the regular season, "Taty" is setto play in Juarez and Pachuca with the Argentina Under-22 team against Mexico's side also preparing for the Olympics. An inclusion on the roster for Tokyo would further boost his stock, but even without it the21-year-old has captured the attention of club directors in Mexico.</p>
      <h3>Cordova getting looks from abroad </h3>
      <p>America midfielder Sebastian Cordova is drawing attention from a number of European teams including Benfica, according to <i><a href="https://www.abola.pt/Nnh/Noticias/Ver/808941">A Bola</a> .</i></p>
      <p>However, if Benfica is going to make Cordova the first Mexican to play at the club since Raul Jimenez, it is said it will have to fight off interest from Sevilla and Manchester United. Cordova has three goals in 11 league matches this season and impressed in Mexico's non-FIFA friendly win against Trinidad and Tobago earlier this month.</p>
      <h3>Salcedo on Marseille's list</h3>
      <p>Olympique Marseille manager Andre Villas-Boas is looking for defensive help this winter and may have personally contacted Tigres center back Carlos Salcedo, according to <i><a href="https://www.footballclubdemarseille.fr/om-actualites/exclu-fcm-mercato-om-villas-boas-aurait-contacte-un-coequipier-de-gignac-pour-cet-hiver.html">various reports</a> . </i></p>
      <p>With OM's defense hurting, the 26-year-old Mexico international may be an attractive option giving his proven European success with Eintracht Frankfurt and Fiorentina and his versatility in playing center back or either fullback slot. Salcedo's Tigres teammate Andre-Pierre Gignac is an OM legend.</p>
      <h3>Guardado set for MLS move in 2020</h3>
      <p>Mexico midfielder Andres Guardado will move to Major League Soccer in 2020, according to <i><a href="https://www.tudn.com/futbol/andres-guardado-jugara-en-el-mls-a-partir-del-2020">TUDN</a></i> .</p>
      <p>While various MLS teams are interested, according to the report, it's the Chicago Fire who would have the first right of refusal. Talks already are underway with Real Betis.</p>
