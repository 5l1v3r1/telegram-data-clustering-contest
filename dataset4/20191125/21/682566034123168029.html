      <p>Cape Town - West Indian batsman <b>Chris Gayle</b> bid an explosive farewell to South Africa and the <b>Jozi Stars</b> in the ongoing Mzansi Super League (MSL).</p>
      <p>The Jozi Stars, who are the defending champions, have <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Cricket/MzansiSuperLeague/Logs">failed to register a win</a> thus far after six games in this year's competition.</p>
      <p>Gayle, who signed up as a marquee international player for the franchise, finished his MSL campaign with <b>101</b> runs in those six matches.</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old revealed that he initially didn't want to partake in the second edition of the MSL, but ultimately changed his mind following the success and spirit he experienced in the Stars' camp last year.</p>
      <p>Gayle went on to launch a surprising attack on the Stars and their players, stating that they needed to "dig deep" to find the root to their current on-field woes.</p>
      <p>"This is not a champions team and this is not how champions should play to defend a title," Gayle told reporters on Sunday at the Wanderers.</p>
      <p>"Most of the times it's been a lot of uncertainty from guys and I don't know if it's an off the field problem, I don't know what's happening but I think individuals, the franchise itself, needs to look at themselves and dig deep with what is happening.</p>
      <p>"This is not the brand of cricket we've been playing so something is wrong. I don't know what it is but we need to find out what's wrong."</p>
      <p>The Stars fell to their sixth consecutive defeat against the <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Cricket/MzansiSuperLeague/stars-implode-to-hand-spartans-derby-win-20191124">Tshwane Spartans this past weekend</a>, which led to many asking "Who is to blame?</p>
      <p>Gayle, who hasn't been in form despite scoring 54 on Sunday, revealed that if he fails to perform, he almost sees himself as a "burden" and that he never gets any respect.</p>
      <p>"As soon as I don't perform in two or three games - most of the time - Chris Gayle is the burden and I am not talking about this team only," said Gayle, who referred to himself in the third person.</p>
      <p>"I'm not going to get respect and people don't remember what you've done for them... Chris Gayle never get no sort of respect.</p>
      <p>"It's just like once Chris Gayle fails, it's the end of his career, he is no good, he is the worst player and all these other things. I've generally overcome these things and I expect these things and I have lived with these things," he ended.</p>
      <p>Gayle will be replaced by Pakistan all-rounder Shoaib Malik for the remainder of the competition.</p>
      <p>The Stars' next game will see them host the Paarl Rocks on Sunday at the Wanderers (10:00).</p>
