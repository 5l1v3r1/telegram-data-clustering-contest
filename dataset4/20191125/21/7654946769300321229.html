      <p>It’s the typo from hell.</p>
      <p>A local newspaper in British Columbia accidentally published an advertisement for a Christmas fair that invited children to take photos with “Satan” — instead of “Santa.”</p>
      <p>The flub appeared <a href="https://twitter.com/npescod/status/1197605670385639424?">in the Nov. 21 edition of the Comox Valley Record</a> in an ad promoting the town’s holiday parade Dec. 1, and events including a “Gnarly Christmas Fair” and “Pictures with Satan.”</p>
      <p>An image of the ad smoldered across the internet, prompting more laughter than fire and brimstone.</p>
      <p>“Pictures with Satan are my kind of Christmas cheer!” <a href="https://twitter.com/TheJenRollins/status/1197681280227266560">one person tweeted</a>.</p>
      <p>“As someone who’s always been afraid of Santa, this ad captures how I’ve always felt about him,” <a href="https://twitter.com/MegzyCole/status/1198266386461511680">added another Twitter user</a>.”</p>
      <p>One person said it appeared her hometown had gotten “a lot more metal since I moved away.”</p>
      <p>“I’d consider the trip for the picture with Satan,” <a href="https://twitter.com/kathytrithardt/status/1198306211679965184">she tweeted</a>.</p>

      <p>The attention prompted the red-faced publication <a href="https://www.comoxvalleyrecord.com/opinion/editorial-ad-lacked-attention-to-detail/">to issue an apology</a>.</p>
      <p>“If you don’t know by now about the unfortunate typo… you are one of the few,” the paper wrote in an editorial.</p>
      <p>“We often chuckle about the typos we have caught, breathing sighs of relief when the L in ‘public’ or the B in ‘Hornby’ is added by the last set of eyes before going to print. Even those are not always caught,” the editorial read.</p>
      <p>“But when it happens in an ad, it becomes all that much more blatant. They are called ‘display ads’ for a reason. They are meant to stand out on the page. This one did that, for all the wrong reasons.”</p>
      <p>Still, the Satanic slip, at least, meant that “everyone in the Comox Valley and beyond knows when the Courtenay Christmas parade is,” the editorial stated.</p>
      <p>“So there’s that.”</p>
