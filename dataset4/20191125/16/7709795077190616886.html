        <b>Jose Mourinho says there is no chance he would bring Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Tottenham due to having Harry Kane already in his team.</b>
      </p>
      <p>38-year-old Ibrahimovic left the LA Galaxy in Major League Soccer last month and has previously said that he is more than able to play in the Premier League again.</p>
      <p>Mourinho signed the Swede while at Manchester United, and he was part of the team that won the League Cup and Europa League during the Portuguese's spell at Old Trafford.</p>

      <p>"We have the best striker in England," said Mourinho. "One of the top two, three strikers in the world.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't make any sense of a striker of Zlatan's dimensions - a striker in his 30s but that can play at any club in the world - it doesn't make sense to come to a club where we have Harry Kane."</p>

      <h3>Champions League challenge</h3>
      <p>Mourinho is preparing for his home debut as Spurs manager against Olympiakos on Tuesday - and after famously getting to the final last season, the new manager claims he will not be scared of anyone in the tournament.</p>
      <p>Former boss Mauricio Pochettino had said it would be a "miracle" if Tottenham won the Champions League, but Mourinho says that he would not be afraid of any Champions League game with the group of players he now has at his disposal.</p>

      <p>"You are almost landing on the moon and don't do it, the frustration is very high," said Mourinho, who is a two-time Champions League winner.</p>
      <p>"It depends a lot on the people's mentality and how you react to disappointment.</p>
      <p>"I would change the word 'miracle' to 'very difficult'. With these boys I will never be afraid of any Champions League match."</p>
