      <h1>WhatsApp set to invest $250,000 into India's start-up ecosystem</h1>
      <h2>Will provide 500 start-ups approved by DPIIT with $500 each of Facebook ad credits</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:49:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:49</time> by <a rel="author">Neha Alawadhi</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/whatsapp">WhatsApp </a>on Monday said it would invest $250,000 into the start-up ecosystem in India through a partnership with Startup India, taking its total investment in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/start-ups">start-ups </a>in the country to $500,000.</p>
      <p>The Facebook-owned messaging platform will provide 500 <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/start-ups">start-ups </a>approved by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) with $500 each of Facebook ad credits. With the ad credits, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/start-ups">start-ups </a>can create ads that invite customers to click open a chat on <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/whatsapp">WhatsApp </a>so they can deepen connections and increase sales.</p>
      <p>In order to be eligible for this incentive, start-ups should be at an early traction or scalable stage and must be recognised by the DPIIT. Interested start-ups can apply through Startup Indiaâ€™s website and selection would be on a first-come-first-serve basis. Once registered, the first 500 entries will receive free Facebook ad credits worth $500.</p>
      <p>This investment comes on the heels of the Startup India-<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/whatsapp">WhatsApp </a>Grand Challenge held in June, which had entrepreneurs develop India-specific solutions with socio-economic impact. At the time, WhatsApp awarded the five winners of the challenge with a grant worth $50,000 each (about Rs 35 lakhs), or $250,000 in total.</p>
