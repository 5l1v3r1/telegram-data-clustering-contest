      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>M&amp;T Bank posted a surprising miss for the third quarter, with higher expenses tied to its mortgage banking operations and IT investments driving the miss.</li>
        <li>Credit costs are starting to become more noticeable, but M&amp;T's credit quality is still fine.</li>
        <li>Management seems more open to M&amp;A, and there are multiple options that would offer worthwhile EPS accretion and franchise expansion.</li>
        <li>M&amp;T Bank doesn't offer a compelling value proposition, but it is still a quality banking name for more conservative investors.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Investors in <b>M&amp;T Bank</b> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTB">MTB</a>) generally appreciate the bank for its conservative approach, and that’s still a valid argument – particularly at this point in the credit cycle where credit costs are starting to rise. On the other hand, M&amp;T doesn’t have a particularly attractive fee-generating business that can offset spread pressures, and the bank’s low-cost deposit base (an important positive over the full cycle) and asset sensitivity remain more problematic. What’s more, M&amp;T’s recent misses at the opex line undermine one of the few areas banks can try to offset spread compression.</p>
      <p>I wasn’t overly fond of the investment prospects of M&amp;T <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4276639-m-and-t-bank-facing-accelerating-headwinds">last time I wrote about the stock</a>, and the shares subsequently dropped more than 10% before a rally that has taken the price back into the $160’s. While management’s apparent incrementally greater willingness to consider M&amp;A is arguably a positive, nothing much has changed on a fundamental basis. I don’t think M&amp;T’s expense issues will prove long-lasting, but I also don’t see a particularly compelling valuation case here either.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>Would M&amp;T Consider An MOE?</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>With <b>BB&amp;T</b> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBT">BBT</a>) and <b>SunTrust</b> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STI">STI</a>) about to close their merger of equals and <b>First Horizon </b>(<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FHN">FHN</a>) and <b>IBERIABANK</b> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBKC">IBKC</a>) having just announced one of their own, investors have started reconsidering the potential of M&amp;A as a driver for banks that few other ways to generate earnings growth in the face of weakening spreads, limited opex leverage, and surplus capital. M&amp;T Bank management has never been as “anti-M&amp;A” as some bank executives, but recent commentary from management does seem to suggest an incrementally greater willingness to look for a deal.</p>
      <p>What could M&amp;T Bank look at for M&amp;A?</p>
      <p>Well, specific to mergers of equals, there aren’t that many options. As is, only <b>Regions</b> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RF">RF</a>) and <b>Northern Trust</b> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTRS">NTRS</a>) are really equals in terms of asset size. <b>KeyCorp</b> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KEY">KEY</a>) is about 17% larger, so “equalish”, and <b>First Republic</b> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FRC">FRC</a>) and <b>Huntington </b>(<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HBAN">HBAN</a>) are likewise “equalish” on the other side.</p>
      <p>Of that list, Regions makes sense to me, and M&amp;T Bank could likely construct an accretive deal. You always have to balance a number of assumptions in accretion/dilution analysis, but I believe M&amp;T could pay a healthy premium and still reap attractive EPS and book valuation accretion.</p>
      <p>As far as more typical whole bank M&amp;A – which tends to offer less integration risk and is certainly something M&amp;T Bank is familiar with – M&amp;T has plenty of options. Banks like <b>People’s United </b>(<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PBCT">PBCT</a>), <b>First Citizens </b>(<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCNCA">FCNCA</a>), <b>Webster </b>(<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBS">WBS</a>), and even <b>Union Bankshares </b>(<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNB">UNB</a>) could all make sense to varying degrees, but I really don’t get the sense that M&amp;T will do a deal just to do a deal – most likely, M&amp;T will look for a target that offers an attractive deposit franchise and/or a strong lending operation but lacks long-term scale.</p>

        <b>
          <b>Expense Mises Highlight One Of The Challenges For Banks</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>M&amp;T Bank has missed sell-side expectations core operating expenses for more than four straight quarters, with the magnitude of the misses increasing. M&amp;T missed by about 6% in the third quarter (taking $0.29 out of earnings relative to expectations), and M&amp;T’s performance there was one of the weaker ones relative to expectations in its peer group.</p>
      <p>Some of the outsized expenses were tied to the bank’s efforts to grow its mortgage banking business, where M&amp;T did report over 55% yoy and 28% qoq growth in revenue this quarter. A lot of it, though, was tied to the bank’s ongoing investments in IT. While M&amp;T has chosen to be a “fast follower” when it comes to bank IT/digitalization, I expect that the investments made by larger rivals like <b>JPMorgan</b> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM">JPM</a>), <b>Bank of America</b> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC">BAC</a>), and <b>Wells Fargo</b> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WFC">WFC</a>) are starting to force M&amp;T to move more quickly to improve its own systems and customer offerings.</p>
      <p>M&amp;T can afford these investments, though they do take an important counter-cyclical positive off the table in this period of rate pressure. Other banks will find this an increasingly difficult burden to bear, and I think a lot of “second tier” banks (those with around $75 billion to $200 billion in assets) will have the opportunity to selectively acquire regional/community franchises where the banks just can’t afford to make the same IT investments.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>Credit Pressure Starting To Show Up, While Rate Pressure Is Here</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I’ve been waiting for credit costs to start showing up as a bigger factor in bank earnings, and that is starting to happen at M&amp;T. Provisioning expense nearly tripled in the third quarter, and M&amp;T showed one of the biggest jumps in NPAs in its peer group. I want to be clear that I don’t believe M&amp;T has a credit quality problem, but I do think credit costs are going to be more of a factor in bank earnings going forward than in the last couple of years.</p>
      <p>Rate pressure is more of a known risk now, with analysts having dialed down expectations in response to Fed rate cuts. With a sequential decline in net interest margin of 13bp, M&amp;T was on the worse end of the scale this quarter (with <b>Comerica</b> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMA">CMA</a>) and a few others). M&amp;T did see a significant increase as well in its interest-bearing deposit costs (up 36bp yoy and 5bp qoq), though the company’s overall cost of deposits remains quite low.</p>
      <p>M&amp;T has relatively few options to offset rate pressure, as there’s not much you can do to lower costs in what is already one of the lowest-cost deposit franchises. Growing the balance sheet is one option, and M&amp;T is doing okay here, with average loans up 3% yoy and 1% qoq, but I don’t think a major step up is likely. One other option is hedging, and M&amp;T has been stepping up its activity here, adding almost $9B to its swap portfolio in the third quarter (bringing the total to over $30 billion). This isn’t a cost-free solution, but M&amp;T has reduced its asset sensitivity relative to earlier in the year.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>The Outlook</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I’ve tweaked my estimates for M&amp;T a little bit, largely because of the overspend on opex, but not much has changed from a long-term fundamental basis. I’m still expecting minimal growth in core earnings over the next five years, with low single-digit growth on a long-term basis. I believe that M&amp;T’s core earnings outlook should support a high single-digit to low double-digit annualized total return for shareholders, and I’d also note that the shares do seem undervalued relative to the bank’s above-average ROTCE.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>The Bottom Line</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I can see an argument for continuing to hold M&amp;T shares, but I don’t see the price as compelling enough to make this a must-buy for me. I do believe M&amp;T could turn to M&amp;A to create value for shareholders, but I do believe the core operating environment for banks remains challenging and I’d want a bigger discount to fair value before buying for my own portfolio.</p>
