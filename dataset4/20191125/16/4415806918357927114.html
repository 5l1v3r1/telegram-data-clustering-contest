      <p>Things almost went horribly wrong for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker director JJ Abrams before the film even hit the big screen.</p>
      <p>Speaking on <a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/">Good Morning America</a>, the director told of how a top secret script wound up for sale on eBay, with the potential of ruining the plot for fans everywhere.</p>
      <p>He said:"The security is insane. The company were really nervous about anything get out, so there were only a handful of scripts and they were printed on crazy uncopyable[sic] paper.</p>
      <blockquote>Then one of our actors, I'm not going to say who. I want to, but I won't, left it under their bed and it was found by someone who was cleaning their place.</blockquote>
      <p>"It was given to someone else, who then went to sell it on eBay and someone at the company said you know there's a script that looks like a legit script that's for sale on eBay?"</p>
      <p>Thankfully, the force was with Abrams and the Star Wars crew, as they manged to get it back before it was sold to any member of the public.</p>
