      <h1>UAW Director Makes Like Past President, Hits the Bricks</h1>

      <p>Following the <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2019/11/uaw-president-gary-jones-resigns-as-union-moves-to-oust-him/">resignation of scandal-tainted UAW President Gary Jones</a> late last week, UAW Region 5 Director Vance Pearson took the cue and followed him out the door. Pearson, charged with embezzlement and money laundering in an ongoing federal corruption probe, was, like Jones, on a paid leave of absence.</p>
      <p>Both men headed for the exit after the UAW, newly infused with an reformist attitude, moved to oust the officials.</p>
      <p>There was no thanking Pearson for his service.</p>
      <p>“The UAW announced today that after the filing of Article 30 charges against him by the UAW’s International Executive Board, Vance Pearson, has informed the UAW that he was resigning as Director of UAW Region 5, effective immediately, and retiring,” the union said in a Sunday statement. “He is also resigning his UAW membership, effective immediately.  Mr. Pearson had been on leave from his position.”</p>
      <p>Pearson was charged in September, one of many UAW officials collared by the federal investigation. Pearson, along with other top officials (including Jones and former UAW President Dennis Williams) are accused of embezzling union dues to the tune of $1.5 million, spending the loot on lavish getaways and glitzy goods.</p>
      <p>Neither Jones nor Williams have been charged, but media sources claim Jones is the “UAW Official A” listed in court documents.</p>
      <p>After taking the helm as acting president, Rory Gamble issued a directive <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2019/11/operation-clean-up-begins-in-earnest-at-the-uaw/">outlining the steps</a> the union will take to restore its reputation, root out corruption, and prevent a takeover by the federal government. That directive came out earlier this month.</p>
      <p>“We wanted to focus on Mr. Pearson’s defense,” said Peason’s lawyer, Scott Rosenblum, when asked about his client’s resignation by <i><a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2019/11/24/uaw-region-5-director-latest-resign-amid-federal-probe/4290399002/">The Detroit News</a></i>.</p>
      <p>Jones and Pearson both hail from St. Louis, where Jones served as Region 5 director before moving into the president’s office. Pearson served as Jones’ assist director starting in 2016, taking over his boss’ old gig in 2018.</p>
