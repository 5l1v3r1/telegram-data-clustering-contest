      <h1>Adnan Syed’s Case, of ‘Serial’ Fame, Is Declined by Supreme Court</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:07:45+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:07</time> by <a rel="author">Karen Zraick</a></address>
      <p>The Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear the case of Adnan Syed, whose murder conviction nearly 20 years ago formed the basis of the hit podcast “Serial.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Syed had petitioned for a new trial, arguing that his original lawyer failed to pursue an alibi witness. But the justices left in place <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/adnan-syed-case-conviction.html?module=inline">a ruling by Maryland’s highest court</a> that denied his petition. They did not comment on <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/112519zor_8mj9.pdf">the decision</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr. Syed is serving a life sentence for the 1999 killing of Hae Min Lee, a high school classmate he had dated whose body was found in a park in Baltimore County. Both were teenagers when the crime occurred. Mr. Syed has maintained that he is innocent.</p>
