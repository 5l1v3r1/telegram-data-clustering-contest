      <p>Rafael Nadal marked his 200th career week at the top of the ATP rankings Monday, becoming the sixth player to spend that much time at No. 1.</p>
      <p>The Spanish superstar joins Roger Federer (310 weeks), Pete Sampras (286), Novak Djokovic (275), Ivan Lendl (270) and Jimmy Connors (268).</p>
      <p>Nadal, who replaced Djokovic at No. 1 on Nov. 4, finished the season with a 58-7 match record. At 33, he is the oldest player to finish the year at No. 1 in the history of the rankings (since 1973).</p>
      <p>It is the fifth time Nadal has finished the season in the top spot, tied for second most all-time (Connors, Federer and Djokovic) behind Sampras’ six times.</p>
      <p>He won four titles in 2019, including his 18th and 19th Grand Slam singles championships at the French Open and U.S. Open.</p>
