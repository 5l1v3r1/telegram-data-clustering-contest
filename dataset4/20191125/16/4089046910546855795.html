      <p><b>(CBS) —</b> One of daytime TV’s best-known actors is celebrating a milestone Monday.</p>
      <p>Peter Bergman, who plays cosmetics mogul Jack Abbott, is marking 30 years on “The Young and The Restless.”</p>
      <p>Monday the show airs a special episode taking a look back at “Smilin’ Jack’s” three decades as one of daytime’s most enduring characters.</p>
      <p>Peter Bergman has been "Young and Restless" now for thirty years, as the sometimes kniving, always charming power player of Genoa City, Jack Abbott</p>
      <p>Bergman says playing Jack is a joy. "There is a side to playing Jack Abbott that comes very easily to me, yes."</p>
      <p>The Emmy Award winner has found himself entangled in hundreds of storylines - ranging from a stint as a morally challenged Wisconsin state senator to going to war with his corporate arch-nemesis, Victor Newman. that ongoing plot led to one of Bergman’s favorite storylines:</p>
      <p>"So he stole Victor's woman and eventually he was going to make the trade with Victor to get Jabot back - you can have Nikki back - and oops he fell in love with her. That was fun to play."</p>
      <p>He ended up marrying Nicki... Twice. He also married Phyllis twice. In fact, Jack's been married eight times, but he can't seem to find enduring love.</p>
      <p>Bergman says he loves his character and he hopes to keep the drama going for many more years to come.</p>
