      <p>TURKISTAN, Kazakhstan -- A court in Kazakhstan’s southern city of Turkistan has sent the case against journalist Amangeldy Batyrbekov, who was sentenced to 2 years and 10 months on libel charges in September, back for further information.<br/><br/>The Turkistan Regional Court ruled on November 25 that the conclusion of a linguistic commission on Batyrbekov's online posts, which were written in Kazakh, "do not correspond to regulations and therefore additional linguistic studies must be performed on the posts."<br/><br/>A court in the town of Saryaghash, on September 23, found Batyrbekov, who has denied any wrongdoing, guilty of insulting the dignity and honor of a local education official, Bakhtiyar Abdiev, in a Facebook post titled "Idiocy in Keles" and sentenced him the same day.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Batyrbekov was sentenced to 18 months of freedom limitation -- a suspended sentence with parole-like restrictions -- for insulting a deputy prosecutor in the Saryaghash district in a newspaper article.<br/><br/>The Almaty-based Adil Soz (A Just Word) human rights group has called Batyrbekov a prisoner of conscience, while the Committee to Protect Journalists has called for all charges to be dropped.<br/><br/>International human rights organization have called on Kazakhstan to revoke an article in the criminal code that sets out criminal prosecution for libel instead of making it a civil case.</p>
