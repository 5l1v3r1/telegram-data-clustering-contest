      <p>Actress Claire King, who plays villain Kim Tate in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a>, has hinted at Graham Foster's exit.</p>
      <p>Recently Graham got on the wrong side of boss and on-and-off lover Kim when he revealed he was in a relationship with vet <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-rhona-goskirk/">Rhona Goskirk</a>.</p>
      <p>However, it looks like a jealous Kim may have a plan up her sleeve to get rid of them both.</p>

      <p>As reported in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/emmerdale-spoilers-kim-tate-graham-leaving-exit-secret-11202912/">Metro</a>, talking about Kim and Graham's relationship, Claire said: "I personally always thought that Graham was the one in love with Kim - and Kim loved him but wasn't in love with him.</p>
      <p>"They've both had their dalliances in the past and they've allowed that because they had an open relationship.</p>
      <p>"But this seems to be different and I think Kim is very worried that Graham might be falling in love with Rhona.</p>
      <p>"That's a bit taboo, as far as the Kim/Graham relationship is concerned.</p>

      <p>"Kim is now starting to feel threatened and I think she's suddenly realising that she might have deeper feelings for Graham than she thought.</p>
      <p>"In an ideal world, Kim expects Graham to keep running back. He has done that every single time in the past.</p>
      <p>"They usually get over it, move on and it's business as usual."</p>
      <p>Claire then reveals she thinks Kim will try to get Graham and Rhona out of the village.</p>
      <p>"But I don't think Graham wants that this time. He just wants a quieter life. Kim feels threatened by this. She'll no doubt try to get them out of the village so the relationship is out of sight."</p>
