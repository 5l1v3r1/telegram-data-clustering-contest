        <li>Reality star and beauty mogul <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian West</a> revealed in a new interview with New York Magazine that her relationship with rapper <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> is causing her to dress less sexy.</li>
        <li>“My husband has voiced that sometimes too sexy is just overkill and he’s not comfortable with it,” Kardashian West said.</li>
        <li>“I listen to him and understand him,” she added.</li>
        <li>However, Kardashian West also said that her decision to wear less revealing clothing was part of an “awakening” she had herself, in part due to her work with the White House for prison reform.</li>

      <p>Kim Kardashian West revealed in a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/kim-kardashian-west-on-her-decade-of-multi-platform-fame.html">new interview with New York Magazine</a> that her relationship with Kanye West is causing her to dress less sexy.</p>
      <p>“My husband has voiced that sometimes too sexy is just overkill and he’s not comfortable with that,” the reality star <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/kim-kardashian-west-on-her-decade-of-multi-platform-fame.html">said in the interview</a>. “I listen to him and understand him.”</p>
      <p>But Kardashian West was adamant that she was still free to dress how she likes, even though West has notably been critical of some of her more revealing looks.</p>
      <p>“At the end of the day, he always gives me the freedom to be and do what I want,” she said.</p>
      <p>According to the beauty mogul and SKIMS founder, her change in style is also due to an “awakening” she had herself – in addition to her recent work advocating for prison reform with White House politicians.</p>

      <p>“I realized I could not even scroll through Instagram in front of my kids without full nudity coming up on my feed pretty much all the time. And I definitely contributed to that,” Kardashian West said, referencing her iconic 2014 cover for Paper Magazine, which featured her nude and oiled up.</p>
      <p>“I also did think, like, ‘Okay, I’m here in the White House,’ and then the next day I was posting, like, a crazy bikini selfie<i>.</i> And I was thinking, ‘I hope they don’t see this<i>.</i> I have to go back there next week,'” she continued.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time West has influenced his wife’s fashion choices.</p>
      <p>On an October episode of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” it was <a href="https://www.insider.com/kanye-west-kim-kardashian-met-gala-corset-too-sexy-kuwtk-2019-10">revealed that West didn’t approve of his wife’s bespoke, skintight Met Gala dress</a>. “You are my wife, and it affects me when pictures are too sexy,” the rapper <a href="https://www.insider.com/kanye-west-kim-kardashian-met-gala-corset-too-sexy-kuwtk-2019-10">told Kardashian West</a>, after she said his comments about her dress were giving her “bad anxiety.”</p>
      <p>West has also <a href="https://www.insider.com/kanye-west-north-west-makeup-christian-2019-10">banned his daughter North from wearing makeup and crop tops until she’s a teenager</a> – something Kardashian West <a href="https://www.insider.com/kanye-west-north-west-makeup-christian-2019-10">doesn’t exactly agree with</a>.</p>
