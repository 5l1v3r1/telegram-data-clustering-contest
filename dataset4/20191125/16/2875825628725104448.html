      <h1>Jose Mourinho addresses Zlatan Ibrahimovic transfer links to Tottenham</h1>
      <h2>Tottenham have been tipped to make a move for former Manchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic following his release from LA Galaxy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:21:33+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:21</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has dismissed Tottenham's chances of signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic, 38, is a free agent following his exit from LA Galaxy in the last few weeks, has been linked with a move to north London due to his relationship with new boss Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has worked with Ibrahimovic at Inter Milan and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , but will not be bringing him to the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> Hotspur Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese says it does not make sense when he has Harry Kane at his disposal.</p>
      <p>"You are right about the connection, we have more than a connection," Mourinho said when asked whether he would be trying to sign the Swede.</p>

      <p>"I would say also passion and understanding, an amazing player and an amazing guy, but I would say no. No chance.</p>
      <p>"We have the best striker in England, we have one of the top two or three strikers in the world, it doesn't make any sense for a striker of Zlatan's dimension, obviously in his late 30s, but still a striker that can play in any club in the world.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't make sense to come to a club where we have Harry Kane."</p>
      <p>It has been a hectic first week for Mourinho at the Spurs helm following his appointment last week.</p>
      <p>After his unveiling to the media on Thursday, he had his first game 48 hours later at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> - which Spurs won 3-2 - and is now preparing for a Champions League clash with Olympiacos on Tuesday.</p>

        <figcaption>Jose Mourinho has been full of praise for Mauricio Pochettino since taking over</figcaption>

      <p>Given the quick turnaround between Mauricio Pochettino leaving and him getting the job - it was less than 12 hours between the two club statements - Mourinho has not yet contacted Pochettino.</p>
      <p>The pair are good friends and the Portuguese is giving his predecessor some space.</p>
      <p>"I didn't (speak to him) because I know what he is feeling," Mourinho said.</p>
      <p>"I have been there and I know that there is a period where the best thing for us sometimes is to process our feelings, to process what happened with us and then in a couple of weeks, two, three weeks then we are open to the world.</p>
      <p>"We are open again to embrace the different period in our lives, so I want to respect that, to give that feeling to him.</p>
      <p>"But I spoke with his son (Maurizio), who is a player in our youth categories, and I think through his boy he can understand my feelings too.</p>

      <p>"And of course I will call him but I want to let him process.</p>
      <p>"I also told the players in contact with him to make him feel completely free to come here any time he wants.</p>
      <p>"I will contact him when I feel that he has had that space.</p>
      <p>"I needed that little bit of space to process things when I left previous clubs. It does not take just five or six days to be open again.</p>
      <p>"You take a little bit of time to process things and understand and to think and rethink.</p>
      <p>"You speak with people and in a couple of weeks he will be fine and I will call him."</p>
