Into this world comes two babies, both of whom have the gift of sight. This is seen by some as hope for a better future, while others fear it is the portent of a final death knell for mankind.</p>
      <p>Momoa leads a tribe who choose to protect the young ones, while religious elders send an army to kill them. Who will prevail?</p>

      <p>Another star-studded series, with Jennifer Aniston taking that lead as a daytime newsroom anchor whose long-term onscreen partner (Steve Carell) is suddenly fired after a sexual abuse scandal. While recovering from this huge setback, Aniston's own job comes under threat from the younger, hungrier journalist played by Reese Witherspoon.</p>
      <p>Studio bosses see a possible star in the making, but does Aniston have what it takes to fight for her anchor role or even her sanity? All will be revealed on The Morning Show.</p>
      <h3>Snoopy in Space</h3>

      <p>Four schoolchildren work to solve mysteries that are triggered when a ghost that haunts the local bookshop frees fictional characters from novels. Chaos and comedy result, in this fun, family-friendly show that's a much gentler alternative to Netflix's Stranger Things.</p>

      <p>If all this drama seems a bit too much, sit back and follow the journey of a herd of elephants as they wander across the wilderness of Africa. Led by their matriarch, Athena, the animals must travel far from their waterhole to find a new home, facing dangers and joys along the way.</p>
      <p>Narrated by BAFTA winner Chiwetel Ejiofor OBE, the documentary features incredible wildlife footage and is a welcome slice of tranquillity in an otherwise tiring world.</p>

      <p>Oprah Winfrey is a phenomenon. Rising from poverty, she fought her way to become one of the most powerful and influential people in modern media.</p>
      <p>One of her many ventures was the Book Club that featured on her talk show for nearly fifteen years. Now this is being reinvented for Apple TV+, with Winfrey selecting a book for each episode then discussing the themes and inspirations with its author. So, buy the book, watch the show, and expand your horizons.</p>
