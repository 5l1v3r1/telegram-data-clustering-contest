      <p>Cheryl has been driven to tears over malicious rumours against her and her Girls Aloud bandmates.</p>
      <p>Over the weekend, it was reported that <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/cheryl">Cheryl</a> and friends Kimberley Walsh and Nicola Roberts <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/cheryl-nadine-girls-aloud-chat-17304944">had set up a What's App group</a> to plot against their former bandmate <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebrity-nadine-girls-aloud-17284171">Nadine Coyle</a> , while the Irish star is in the jungle on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity.</a></p>
      <p>The rumour was that the trio wanted to see suffer and vote for her to do all the Bushtucker Trials, but the girls were left so incensed by the reports that all three of them made statements to rubbish them, with Cheryl saying "We only want to see Nadine do well, and regardless of any differences we might have had, we will always all have love for each other.</p>
      <p>"We did not enjoy watching her distressed when jumping out of the plane. And we donâ€™t have time for group chats regarding the trials on the show!"</p>
      <p>And appearing on Monday's Loose Women, Kimberley told the panel Cheryl "absolutely cried her eyes out" when the Whatsapp group rumours were talked about.</p>
      <p>In a rather heated discussion, the ex-Strictly Come Dancing contestant said: "How awful though! No but it's completely untrue. It surprised me and Cheryl.</p>
      <p>"She text me saying 'I'm absolutely crying my eyes out'. I don't like the negativity. I'm impressed [with Nadine]. She's doing so great!"</p>
      <p>However, Kimberley did add that while she has "a genuine connection," with Cheryl and Nicola, her friendship with Nadine and other Girls Aloud bandmate Sarah Harding was always just on a work basis, saying "Yeah [I was more friendly with Cheryl and Nicola]. It is true genuine real connection between us three.</p>
      <p>"With Sarah and Nadine, it was more of a work relationship but it's like family you'd feel for them. You don't see them all the time. It surprised me how much i do care... I'm a real girls' girl."</p>
