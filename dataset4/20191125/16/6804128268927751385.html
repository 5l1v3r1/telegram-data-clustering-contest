      <h1>Bruno Fernandes latest: Jose Mourinho decisive as Spurs target 'practically guaranteed' to leave</h1>
      <h2>Sporting midfielder Bruno Fernandes was heavily linked to Spurs and Manchester United - will Jose Mourinho's arrival in north London prove decisive in his future?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:45:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:45</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Doyle</a></address>
      <p>Bruno Fernandes was strongly linked with a move to both Spurs and Manchester United in the summer.</p>
      <p>However, no move came for the midfielder, who has stayed with Sporting amid a reported €70million asking price.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid were also credited with a keen interest in the Portugal international</p>
      <p>But with all three sides initially struggling this term, it appears likely that the trio could reignite their interest in January, in what could again be a long and drawn out saga.</p>
      <p>Here is what we know so far bout the midfielder's future.</p>
      <h3>Tottenham's interest</h3>
      <p>Portuguese publication Record, as reported by <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/tottenham-ready-move-forward-concrete-proposal-signing-player-will-decide-soon/">Sport Witness</a>, claimed that Spurs were ready to 'move forward with a concrete proposal' worth over €70million to sign Fernandes, while according to Jornal de Noticias a bid of €65million had been submitted.</p>
      <p>However, <b>football.london</b> understood early on in the transfer window that Spurs did not see the midfielder as a priority during the summer window.</p>
      <h3>What Fernandes has said</h3>
      <p>Fernandes spoke numerous times about his future and suggested that he would like to move to the Premier League but these comments from the playmaker were the most telling in the summer.</p>
      <p>"The president decides that, not me," he told <a href="https://www.abola.pt/Nnh/Noticias/Ver/798604"><i>A Bola.</i></a><i> </i>"I don't care about the market, I've talked about this many times.</p>
      <p>"The only thing I can do now is that I need to catch the plane so I don't miss it. Will this be the last match for Sporting? I don't know, it's the coach who decides.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"I said I'd like to play in England, but I don't care about it right now. If it could be this season? It could be when the club decides, I'm not in charge."</p>
      <h3>Sporting CP's stance</h3>
      <p>Sporting CP manager Marcel Keizer spoke about the future of Fernandes and explained that any exit would depend on who the club could buy to replace him.</p>
      <p>"It depends, of course, on who can enter later if Bruno leaves. Quality players like that we can't replace."</p>
      <h3>Spurs 'meeting'</h3>
      <p>Reports from the Portugeuse media claimed that Tottenham sent a delegation to Lisbon to make an offer for Fernandes on August 1.</p>
      <p>Public service broadcaster <a href="https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/desporto/tottenham-interessado-em-bruno-fernandes_v1164119">RTP </a>and <a href="https://www.ojogo.pt/futebol/1a-liga/sporting/noticias/interior/emissario-do-tottenham-em-lisboa-para-negociar-bruno-fernandes-11172050.html">O Jogo </a>both claimed that Spurs travelled to the city to try and agree a deal.</p>
      <p>Record - as translated by <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/tottenhams-signing-meeting-finished-5-30pm-answer-now-taken-back-london/">Sport Witness</a> - have suggested that a €70milion bid was rejected by Sporting CP president Frederico Varandas at a meeting between the two sides.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Furthermore, the report claimed Spurs and Sporting CP could hold another meeting within the next week, although according to Sky Sports the north London club were not interested in making any further bids.</p>
      <p>It was a curious situation. For representatives of Tottenham to fly to the Portuguese capital to make an offer below the asking price for a player they did not see as a priority earlier in the window, and to then apparently end up deciding against taking any further action, seemed an odd move.</p>
      <p>Some Spurs fans even suggested that the club was merely trying to <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/transfer-news/spurs-transfers-fernandes-lo-celso-16684931">use Sporting and Fernandes in a bid to spook Real Betis</a> and get a better deal for Giovani Lo Celso.</p>
      <h3>'Agreement reached' with the player</h3>
      <p>According to Portuguese journalist Goncalo Lopes, Tottenham and Fernandes reached an agreement over personal terms although Spurs did not reach an agreement with the player's club.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It was claimed that the latest offer made by Tottenham was €50m plus €10m in add ons, a fee which fell €10m short of Sporting's valuation.</p>
      <h3>Manchester United's involvement</h3>
      <p>However, there were conflicting reports over Manchester United's involvement in the deal.</p>
      <p>Lopes claimed that there has been 'no contact' between the club and the player's agent, but Portuguese outlet <a href="https://www.cmjornal.pt/desporto/futebol/detalhe/exclusivo-cm--jorge-mendes-em-manchester-para-garantir-proposta-por-bruno-fernandes-acompanhe-agora-no-pe-em-riste-na-cmtv">cm jornal</a> claimed that super agent Jorge Mendes, who was tasked with sorting a move for Fernandes, was in Manchester discussing a €70m bid from the Red Devils.</p>
      <h3>Fernandes' reaction</h3>
      <p>Reports in Portugal claimed that Bruno Fernandes was starting to feel 'uneasy' about the situation regarding his future.</p>
      <p>According to Record (via <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/tottenhams-official-offer-triggers-compensation-player-can-no-longer-cope-transfer-situation/">SportsWitness</a>), the player told Sporting that he was not enjoying how the transfer saga was working out.</p>
      <p>Tottenham were said to have made an offer of €60m for the midfielder, therefore triggering a clause in the player's contract that meant his club would have to pay him €5m due to a loyalty clause after they turned down an offer in excess of €35m.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>However, Sporting were said to be reluctant to pay the money, and instead considered offering Fernandes a new contract worth €5m a year.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese club were reportedly holding out for a fee of €70m, with super agent Jorge Mendes involved in the deal.</p>
      <p>The article in Record went on as far to say that the player 'can no longer cope' with the transfer saga, but was not ready to force a move from his club to Spurs.</p>
      <h3>Fernandes opens up on failed move</h3>
      <p>The player admitted after the transfer window closed that he agreed a deal to join Spurs.</p>
      <p>But Tottenham did not have an agreement with Sporting over a fee for the player.</p>
      <p>In an interview with GQ, Fernandes said: "As you all know, Tottenham made a lot of proposals for me. Everything was right with me - or practically should be.</p>
      <p>"I never made any big demands, my manager was always dealing with the finances. It was, and is my goal to play in England, Sporting know that, everyone knows that, and there were conditions for things to be done.</p>
      <p>"But Sporting understood that the value was not enough and I have to respect the decision."</p>
      <h3>Real Madrid move</h3>
      <p>When the summer transfer window closed in England, a move to another European club seemed like the only possible option for Fernandes.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-transfer-target-bruno-19165438">reportedly</a> agreed a £64million deal for the midfielder on deadline day in Spain, but a move failed to materialise.</p>
      <p>That meant that Fernandes would need to stay on Portugal until January at least.</p>

      <h3>Fernandes 'practically guaranteed' to leave</h3>
      <p>Portuguese outlet <a href="https://abola.pt/Clubes/Noticias/Ver/816523/147">A Bola</a> are now reporting that Bruno Fernandes is "practically guaranteed" to leave the club.</p>
      <p>It's likely to come in the summer transfer window, but could come in January, with Spurs and Manchester United said to be the two "strongest interested" clubs.</p>

      <p>They state that the midfielder is set to be offered a pay rise in Lisbon - but the end date of his contract and the release clause will not change.</p>
      <p>His buyout clause is still set at €100million, but apparently Sporting would be willing to accept an offer of around €70m for their midfielder in January.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is said to be a fan of the 25-year-old, and the manager's arrival in north London could prove enough to entice the midfielder to pick Spurs over Manchester United.</p>
