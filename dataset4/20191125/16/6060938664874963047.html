      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:56:24+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:56</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>The first look of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kangana-Ranaut">Kangana Ranaut</a>'s <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/'Thalaivi'">'Thalaivi'</a> has been the talk of the town. It received a lot of appreciation and love from all the quarters while some social media users trolled Kangana's look as late Tamil Nadu chief minister J. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/J.-Jayalalithaa">Jayalalithaa</a>.</p>
      <p>And now, Kangana's sister <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rangoli-Chandel">Rangoli Chandel</a> has come out in support of the actress. Rangoli who is also Kangana's manager, stated that those who got eyes can see the fantastic work done by the prosthetic team.</p>
      <p>She tweeted, "Anyone who has got eyes can see the brilliance of prosthetic work baki samosa gang is there jo din ko raat aur raat ko din kehte hain, they are inconsequential 😁🙏".</p>

      <p>This was a Rangoli Chandel's response to the countless memes and negative jibes that have come Kangana's way, ever since the first look poster was released online on Saturday.</p>
      <p>'Thalaivi' also features <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Arvind-Swami">Arvind Swami</a>, and the film directed by Vijay is slated to open on June 26 next year.</p>
