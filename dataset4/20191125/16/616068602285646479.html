      <p>With temperatures set to fall to lows of -12 C later this week, Kelowna's Shadow Ridge Golf Club gave duffers one last chance to hit the links Monday, before closing for the season.</p>
      <p>With no snow in the valley bottom, the course enjoyed a long season this year.</p>
      <p>General manager James Prestail was impressed by the number of golfers still turning out into November, with 50 to 80 players coming out on nice days lately.</p>
      <p>"Most of them are just doing it so they can write their friends back home, whether they’re in Toronto or Alberta, and just say they’re still getting out on the golf course. So they’re tongue in cheek with their friends, and some are getting out to get that extra bit of exercise before they hibernate for the winter and pack up their golf clubs.</p>
      <p>"We’re getting these extra bonus days here in November, so overall it's been a great season for us. And, from what I’ve heard about the rest of the courses in Kelowna, they’ve had a wicked season, too."</p>
      <p>But, the anticipated cold snap will bring that to an end. </p>
      <p>Tuesday should be the last day this week with a high above freezing in the Okanagan, and temperatures will continue to dip Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
      <p>Friday's forecast high is just -7 C with a low of -12. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement for areas north of the Okanagan.</p>
      <p>Temperatures could drop as low as -25 C in some parts of north and central B.C. starting Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"The cold air will persist through the end of the week with temperatures in the -15 C to -25 C range," reads the statement. "Blustery northerly winds will accompany the arrival of the Arctic air with windchill becoming a factor."</p>
