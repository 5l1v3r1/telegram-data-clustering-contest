      <p>With just over two weeks to go until polling day, Jeremy Corbyn continues to lead his rivals in the number of campaign visits.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader has clocked up 43 different constituencies so far, ranging from Dundee West in Scotland to Filton &amp; Bradley Stoke in south-west England.</p>
      <p>As of November 25, he has visited an equal number of Conservative and Labour seats: 17 each.</p>
      <p>The Conservative seats have all been marginals that are on Labour’s target list – and all bar three would change hands on a swing of below 5%.</p>

      <p>The Labour constituencies visited by Mr Corbyn have been a mixture of Tory targets (such as Ashfield and Crewe &amp; Nantwich) and safe Labour seats where he has staged a high-profile event or campaign launch.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn has also visited six seats being defended by the SNP plus three seats formerly held by independents, including Putney and Dudley North – two constituencies targeted by both Labour and the Tories.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson has made campaign visits to 35 seats – eight fewer than his Labour counterpart.</p>
      <p>But unlike Mr Corbyn, the Prime Minister has been to Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as Scotland and England.</p>
      <p>He has also been to a seat being defended by the Liberal Democrats (Brecon &amp; Radnorshire), something the Labour leader has yet to do.</p>
      <p>Overall Mr Johnson has paid campaign visits to 17 Labour constituencies, including some (Sedgefield, Stockton North, Oldham West &amp; Royton) that would need very big swings to change hands.</p>
      <p>Others are Labour-held marginals, such as Bedford, Wolverhampton South West and Wrexham.</p>
      <p>He has been to 15 Conservative constituencies, including his own seat (and Labour target) Uxbridge &amp; South Ruislip.</p>
      <p>Visits to Newry &amp; Armagh in Northern Ireland (being defended by Sinn Fein) and Broxtowe in the East Midlands (which Anna Soubry is defending for the Independent Group for Change) complete Mr Johnson’s list.</p>
      <p>Jo Swinson has made far fewer visits than her two counterparts.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrat leader has been to 19 seats so far: nine Labour, six Conservative, three SNP and one independent.</p>
      <p>She has yet to make a campaign visit to a constituency being defended by her own party.</p>
      <p>Intriguingly, the Tory seats she has visited include some places which require huge swings for the Lib Dems to win – such as Watford (18.3%), Esher &amp; Walton (20.7%) and North East Somerset (22.7%).</p>
      <p>She has also been to the most marginal seat in the UK: Fife North East, where the SNP is defending a majority of two and which would fall to the Lib Dems on a swing of 0.01%.</p>
