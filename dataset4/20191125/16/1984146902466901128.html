      <h1>Amazing story of the desperately ill kitten whose life was saved by a transfusion of dog’s blood</h1>
      <h2>The canine blood kept little Ellie, who weighed less than 10 ounces, alive</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:34:02+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:34</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Dickinson</a></address>
      <p>A four-week-old kitten who was on the brink of death has been saved by a transfusion of dog's blood.</p>
      <p>The canine blood kept little Ellie — who, at just 10 ounces weighed less than a third of bag of sugar — alive.</p>
      <p>The rare procedure was only performed because there was not enough time to find a suitable cat donor.</p>
      <p>Since then Ellie has beaten the odds and is now fighting fit.</p>
      <p>Emergency vets and vet nurses at  <a href="http://www.vets-now.com/">Vets Now</a>  in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead">Gateshead</a> , along with cat lover Maureen Franklin, founder of the New Beginnings Cat Rehoming charity, played a vital role in Ellie’s recovery.</p>

      <p>“I got a call about Ellie overnight to say she was very poorly,” said Maureen, 68.</p>
      <p>“She was absolutely covered in fleas and when we got her to the vets she had no red cells and her gums were actually white.</p>
      <p>“She needed a transfusion and because it was so urgent, they did that with blood from a dog.”</p>
      <p>Veterinary nurse Helen Spry, of Vets Now in Gateshead, saved the day, not only by administering the vital transfusion, but by allowing her own dog, Bella, to act as the blood donor.</p>
      <p>The lifesaving procedure, known as a xenotransfusion, kept the desperately ill kitten alive in the short term, but she soon took a turn for the worse again.</p>

      <p>The Vets Now pet emergency clinic proved to be the salvation once more for Maureen and her little kitten.</p>
      <p>“Ellie was suffering from severe anaemia,” said emergency vet Sara Jackson, who is the district clinical lead for the Vets Now Gateshead clinic.</p>
      <p>“Blood transfusions between two species are not common. But if we didn't do it, she would have died, so we had nothing to lose.</p>
      <p>“Although the xenotransfusion kept her going for several days, it wasn’t enough and she deteriorated again and we needed to organise a feline blood donor.”</p>
      <p>Cat's blood is a little harder to come by than dog's blood so with time running out, Maureen put out an urgent call to her charity’s 6,000 followers.</p>

      <p>Thankfully, one of them had a healthy cat she thought might fit the bill and checks at Vets Now found she was a suitable donor.</p>
      <p>“The donor cat was an absolutely perfect match, so it was able to go ahead in the nick of time,” said Maureen.</p>
      <p>Following the donation and dedicated after-care, little Ellie soon showed signs of a remarkable recovery.</p>
      <p>“She somehow made it through the night and in the morning she was much brighter and even eating and playing,” continued Sara.</p>
      <p>Kind-hearted supporters of New Beginnings rallied round to meet the cost of the skilled Vets Now treatment and Maureen was thrilled to have the kitten safely back.</p>
      <p>“I had a cat who needed a transfusion years ago so I know the difference it can make,” said Maureen. “But it was still amazing to see how she looked.</p>
      <p>“When she went in she was nearly dead and she was so weak she could barely lift her head up.</p>
      <p>“After she came out she was soon running around the living room and putting on weight. She had actually been called Angel but I think it was only right that we renamed her Ellie after the cat that saved her.”</p>
