      <p>The Child Protection Unit (CPU) has established Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) – an online group created to combat any form of online child sexual exploitation and abuse.</p>
      <p>In a Facebook post on Saturday where he made the announcement, ICU operations director James McCabe said the ICAC will carry out its work in cooperation with the National Police.</p>
      <p>McCabe wrote: “The Commissioner-General of the Cambodian National Police formally approved the establishment of ICAC on the 29th of October 2019. Operations will commence immediately.</p>
      <p>“There is still some procedural work to be done to ensure we are using best practices and gather[ing] the evidence but we are very excited to be a part of this important work.”</p>
      <p>McCabe told The Post on Sunday that the penalty would be relative to the crime committed. An offender guilty of grooming a child with the objective of committing illicit sexual acts will be punished severely.</p>
      <p>Similarly, possession of pornographic materials will receive a different penalty. “So far we’ve already had one arrest of an offender [earlier this year] – a local offender who groomed a 12-year-old, then encouraged the minor to have sex with him,” the CPU operations director said.</p>
      <p>Nine men in Siem Reap were also arrested for distributing child pornographic materials online, he added.</p>
      <p>McCabe commended the government and the Cambodian National Police for having the foresight to respond to such an emerging global issue.</p>
      <p>Chou Bun Eng, the secretary of state and permanent vice-chair of the National Committee for Counter Trafficking (NCCT), told The Post on Sunday that the ministry will primarily focus on surveillance against predators on the internet.</p>
      <p>“It is important to monitor online communication channels which most of our kids use. Children are not the only ones who use these channels; even adults do. Opportunists will take advantage of these channels to prey on children,” Bun Eng said.</p>
      <p>In line with this, Bun Eng strongly encouraged the immediate cooperation of online users such as reporting any suspicious activities on the internet.</p>
