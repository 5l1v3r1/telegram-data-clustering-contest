      <p>Frozen 2 has beaten the box office debut of its predecessor, taking in $350 million worldwide in its opening weekend.</p>
      <p>In fact, it’s the highest opening for an animated film of all time. So, kind of a big deal.</p>
      <p>But is it better than the original?</p>
      <p>We know, we know – a pretty impossible question to answer!</p>
      <p>While the first Frozen film – which was released in 2013 and grossed $1.276 billion – scored a 90% ‘Fresh’ rating on Rotten Tomatoes, Frozen 2 has scored a little lower.</p>
      <p>The follow up, which once again features the voices of Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel and Jonathan Groff, is currently on 75%, as per the film reviews aggregator.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But there’s plenty of evidence on social media that Frozen 2 is just as good as, if not better than, Frozen.</p>
      <p>(And given some of the thought that’s gone into these fan reviews, we think film critics had better start looking over their shoulder. And they’re spoiler-free too!)</p>

      <p>Our favourite takeaways from the above?</p>
      <p>Probably ‘it took what was great about the first one and made it even better’, plus ‘Olaf is MVP [most valuable player] for sure!’ and ‘btw, there’s an end credit scene.’ (Good to know!)</p>

      <p>As positively as Frozen 2’s gone down, however, don’t set your heart on as Frozen 3 just yet. At present, it looks like anyone hoping for a full-on franchise will be sorely disappointed.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Lee, the director, writer and chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios recently told <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a29831651/frozen-3-release-date-trailer-cast-plot/">Digital Spy</a>: ‘For us, this feels like what we set out to accomplish.’</p>
      <p>‘It feels like the end, but the first one felt like the end when we did it,’ she then added. ‘We don’t know. I think, right now, it feels like the end.’</p>
      <p>Well, it’s not an out and out no. We can but hope!</p>
