Allen is based in the company’s Los Angeles headquarters and reports to Courtney Williams, Head of Partnerships, Parrot Analytics.</p>
      <p>Ms. Allen joins Parrot Analytics from Reddit, where she was Strategy Lead and a Senior Partnerships Executive. Prior to Reddit, she was Brand Strategy Director at Buzzfeed. Before that, Ms. Allen was Sales Manager, Brand Partnerships at Tumblr; Sales and Product Marketing at Facebook; and Account Executive and Product Marketing at Google.</p>
      <p>In her new role at Parrot Analytics, Ms. Allen will access and translate the company’s extensive data sets for the advertising, marketing and brand sectors of the media business. She will be working with ad and media buying agencies, global consumer brands and the advertising and marketing divisions of entertainment companies around the world.</p>
      <p>“In the last few years, we have seen the convergence of all forms of media – TV across all platforms, social media and gaming platforms creating content, etc. All of this overlaps and vies for consumers’ attention. At Parrot Analytics, we capture that attention as expressions of demand to help content producers, distributors, buyers and sellers understand the qualities that are driving viewer interest and engagement, as well as the value that can be attributed to that content. Now, we are extending our reach to help companies get ahead of entertainment and business trends. Using Parrot Analytics vast data sets and innovative new metrics, Stephanie will quantify the attention economy for brands, advertisers and marketers looking for the most valuable content properties to associate with, regardless of the medium,” said Courtney Williams, Head of Partnerships, Parrot Analytics.</p>
      <p>“The need for personalized experiences and connections in an ever-shifting, hyper-fragmented market requires ad and marketing blueprinting and supply chain decisions to be more analytical and strategic. Many have turned to branded content and product placement as a means to re-connect with younger consumers. I’m enthusiastic about being able to help ad marketers, brands and agencies get ahead of fast-moving trends and identify the best content and strategy to reach receptive audiences via Parrot Analytics’ unique global demand insights,” said Ms. Allen.</p>
