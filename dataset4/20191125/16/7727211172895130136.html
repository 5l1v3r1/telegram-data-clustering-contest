      <h1>Former Premier League referee ends debate about Liverpool VAR at Crystal Palace</h1>
      <h2>Crystal Palace had a goal disallowed by VAR against Liverpool</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:46:14+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/paul-clarke/" target="_blank">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool and VAR have gone hand in hand this season at times but one former referee has now provided a verdict which counters the narrative of good luck.</p>
      <p>Man City were denied a penalty earlier this month when the ball hit Trent Alexander-Arnold's arm in the penalty box, before <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> went up the other end and scored thanks to a brilliant Fabinho strike.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola was up in arms throughout the match as he perceived that his side had been on the end of some tough VAR calls.</p>
      <p>It's something which has helped start the narrative on social media that Liverpool are enjoying a lot of luck in VAR's first season in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>This notion led to former Arsenal star Paul Merson's bizarre reaction to Crystal Palace's disallowed goal in Liverpool's 2-1 win at Selhurst Park on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The game was still level at 0-0 in the first half when James Tomkins had his effort ruled out due to Jordan Ayew's push on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/dejan-lovren">Dejan Lovren</a> .</p>
      <p>Merson said on Sky Sports: "That's ridiculous, shall we just give Liverpool the league now?"</p>
      <p>But come Monday morning and former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher's regular stint on Sky Sports' Ref Watch, saner heads prevailed.</p>
      <p>"When you see that angle I cannot see anything but a foul," Gallagher told Sky Sports. "It's a foul isn't it. There is physical contact and there are fouls.</p>
      <p>"You can't keep making mistakes. You have to be wise enough to make changes after making mistakes. He is pushed. When VAR sees that angle it's very difficult to not disallow it. It's subjective and VAR thought it was a foul."</p>
