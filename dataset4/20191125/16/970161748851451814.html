        <b>The Walking Dead now won’t be returning for two months, but, obviously, would leave us guessing with a killer cliffhanger about what’s to come.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Now, with the extended release of the new trailer over what to expect when season 10 makes a comeback, there’s hints there may finally be life in a potential romance between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Eugene (Josh McDermitt).</p>
      <p>In a series of quick shots about what happens next to the survivors, the platonic couple are seen leaning in to each other as if they’re about to kiss.</p>
      <p>Can Eugene’s hopes for a romance finally be coming true?</p>
      <p><a href="https://comicbook.com/thewalkingdead/2019/10/21/the-walking-dead-showrunner-eugene-rosita-relationship-romance-season-10/">Speaking to Entertainment Weekly</a> ahead of the show’s mid-season finale, showrunner Angela Kang said: ‘Well, you never know.</p>
      <p>‘I mean, the story goes in directions that the story goes, but we felt like it had kind of organically gotten to that place, and he has been infatuated with her for so long, but like, man, how long can you keep that going if she’s just not interested?</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘And in this episode where everybody is just at the brink of exhaustion and stress and everything, that felt like kind of like the right time to show side effects other than just all this stuff happening with the Whisperers.</p>
      <p>‘There’s always a personal aspect to all of that too.’</p>

      <p>Rosita has previously made it clear in no uncertain terms that her bond with Eugene was just a friendly one, despite him hanging on hope.</p>
      <p>In episode three of this season, she had to lay down the law for good and claim that it was ‘never going to happen’ after it became clear that he wasn’t taking her hints.</p>
      <p>But season 10 has been hard on Rosita, especially following the death of Siddiq (Avi Nash), leaving her to raise daughter Coco by herself.</p>
      <p>Attacked by Dante (Juan Javier Cardenas), a spy for the Whisperers in the latest episode, it was only with Eugene’s help that she was able to escape a walker fight with her life.</p>
      <p>While she is sleeping with Father Gabriel (Seth Gillam), could she be softening towards the idea of Eugene after all?</p>
