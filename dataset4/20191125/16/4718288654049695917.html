      <p>The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) of Maharashtra on Monday gave a clean chit to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar in the Rs 70,000 crore irrigation scam. The investigating agency has also closed the probe into the scam.</p>
      <p>After becoming chief minister in 2014, the Devendra Fadnavis government had given the go-ahead for an ACB inquiry into the irrigation scam involving Ajit Pawar and other top NCP leaders â€” a probe that was ongoing till Monday.</p>
      <p>The Vidarbha scam is related to the alleged graft in approval and execution of various irrigation projects during the Congress-NCP rule. Ajit Pawar was among the ministers who were in charge of the irrigation department at different times between 1999 and 2014.</p>
      <p>The ACB move comes just two days after Ajit Pawar took oath as the deputy of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. In a dramatic turn of events, Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar were sworn-in by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari at 8 am on Saturday at a hush-hush ceremony in Raj Bhavan here, leading to the lifting of the President's rule in the state.</p>
      <p>The BJP was propped up by NCP's Ajit Pawar who revolted against his party headed by his uncle Sharad Pawar.</p>
      <p>The BJP and the Sena, which fought the last month's Assembly polls in an alliance, secured a comfortable majority by winning 105 and 56 seats respectively.</p>
      <p>The Sena, however, broke its three-decade-long ties with the BJP after the latter declined to share the chief minister's post. The NCP and Congress won 54 and 44 seats respectively.</p>
      <p>Earlier, in the morning, the Supreme Court has reserved its order on the Maharashtra floor test for 10.30 am Tuesday after hearing the plea filed by the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress combine against the Maharashtra governor's decision to swear in Devendra Fadnavis as chief minister.</p>
