      <p>Capcom has revealed that <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/devil_may_cry_3_special_edition">Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition</a></b> is headed to a Switch near you, with a digital release planned for Nintendo's hybrid machine. You won't have too long to wait before you can get your hands on it either, as it's set to launch on 20th February 2020.</p>
      <p>If you're unfamiliar with this one, Devil May Cry 3 is actually a prequel set years before the original <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/devil_may_cry"><b>Devil May Cry</b></a> with a younger version of Dante serving as the protagonist. The origin story explores the journey leading up to and culminating in Dante’s face-off against his twin brother, Vergil, who is set on unlocking a gate to the demonic realm. Here's a little more from the press release:</p>
      <blockquote>Dante must use his trademark sword Rebellion and dual pistols Ebony and Ivory to stop Vergil and prevent the world from becoming infested by demons. Along the way, players will gain insight into many aspects of the series from the first encounter with fan-favourite Lady as well as the beginnings of Dante’s shop and origins of the series name.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Devil May Cry 3 continued the series’ trademark for intense, non-stop action with flair, while introducing the new "style" based combat system with six selectable options including Swordmaster and Gunslinger that change up the gameplay. Each style has its own range of features, and players can power up their favorite style for increased special attack abilities, bringing an extra level of strategy to the action. Devil May Cry 3 also introduced the ability to switch between currently equipped weapons on the fly for additional combat freedom.</blockquote>

      <p>This Special Edition release offers the addition of Vergil as a playable character and the 9,999 floors of the 'Bloody Palace' survival mode. It'll launch for $19.99, just like the original Devil May Cry and <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/devil_may_cry_2"><b>Devil May Cry 2</b></a>'s current prices on the Switch eShop.</p>
