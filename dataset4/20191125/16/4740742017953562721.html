      <h1>Kalas, Moore, Hunt: Latest Bristol City injury news ahead of trip to West Brom</h1>
      <h2>Just as the Robins look to be in the clear, another one bites the dust</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:35:15+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:35</time> by <a rel="author">Alfie House</a></address>
      <p>Bristol City’s injury woes have continued for what feels like forever, with every passing international break leading to players returning to Failand with knocks or worse.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/not-bad--just-boring-3571903">goalless draw against Nottingham Forest</a> sprung the latest pair of surprise absentees in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/lee-johnson-explains-tomas-kalas-3571765">Tomas Kalas and Taylor Moore</a>, who were both ruled out with knee injuries.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">City have managed</a> to keep chugging along through their injury issues, returns to the first team for those players who have missed an extended period of time will be a welcome boost, as Championship teams head into the busy winter schedule.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tomas Kalas</b>
      </p>
      <p>Notably absent from the Forest draw with a knee injury as he signed autographs in the Lansdown Stand, Tomas Kalas has missed more than two months due to injury this season already.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, it doesn’t look like another extended time on the sidelines for the Czech Republic international who aggravated a previous issue when he trained immediately after playing against Cardiff.</p>
      <p>Johnson said after Saturday’s game: "Kalas has got a longstanding tendonitis issue - another by-product of international training regimes.</p>
      <p>"I think Kalas has got to be stronger - he played on the Sunday and trained fully on the Monday."</p>
      <p>Kalas is expected to return for City sooner rather than later, but the recurring knee issue does mean he’s a potential absence for the trip to West Brom.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Taylor Moore</b>
      </p>
      <p>The centre-half has forced himself into the first-team fold this season following injuries and departures but was absent himself from Saturday’s game, also with a knee complaint.</p>
      <p>"Taylor Moore has had a scan on his knee - hopefully it’s not too bad. It could just be bone bruising," Johnson added.</p>

      <p>"But he has got to get it assessed. He's getting swelling on the knee and when you get that at 22 I don't want to risk it. He's got a bright future ahead of him and has done well."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Korey Smith</b>
      </p>
      <p>The City No7 edges ever closer to his long-awaited return, after he was named amongst the substitutes in the Robins’ 0-0 draw with Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>Whilst the defensive midfielder didn’t get onto the pitch, being named on the bench was a big step in his recovery after he racked up 160 minutes of game time for the Under-23s in the last couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>Smith is unlikely to start and will still have to work on his fitness, after suffering a broken bone in his foot and suffering ligament damage, but tellingly he didn't play for the U23s in their 1-0 win at Ipswich on Monday, almost guaranteeing he'll be in the squad again at the Hawthorns.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jack Hunt</b>
      </p>
      <p>The full-back’s hamstring injury has sidelined him for over a month, but his return looks imminent.</p>
      <p>Last week Dean Holden admitted he could be contention for the Forest game but he just missed out on the matchday squad.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the goalless draw with Forest, Johnson added that, barring any further issues, the full-back will be in contention for Wednesday night.</p>

        <b>Jay Dasilva</b>
      </p>
      <p>The left-back has been out injured with a fractured tibia since the opening game of the season against Leeds, after he joined the Robins permanently on a four-year-deal this summer.</p>
      <p>He could make his return before 2020 though, the former Chelsea player is back on grass but still in 1-to-1 training away from the group.</p>
      <p>The initial timeline for his return was January, so he is making good progress providing there are no fresh setbacks in training.</p>
