      <p>Schoolkids across the area have been getting creative to come up with innovative names for the region’s gritters.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the talents of kids from primary and secondary schools, six of the vehicles have special new monikers.</p>
      <p>The winning titles were announced last week as Plougher of Scotland, from Ross Wardrop, S3 at Our Lady and St Patrick’s; Gritty Gritty Bang Bang, from Aimee Reid in S3 at Vale of Leven Academy; Darth Salter, from Amy McColl in S5 at Vale of Leven Academy; Gritty McGritterson from Eryn Fabiani in P7 at Balloch Primary School; The Gritonator from Sophie Deeley in P5 at St Stephen’s Primary and Auntie Slip from Alicia Glasgow in P5 at St Stephen’s Primary.</p>

      <p>The winning pupils were invited along to Elm Road Depot, along with Councillor Iain McLaren, Councillor Marie McNair, and council leader Councillor Jonathan McColl this week to see their named gritters in person, and receive a prize for their efforts.</p>
      <p>Infrastructure convener, Councillor Iain McLaren, said: “A big thank you to all the children who entered the competition, especially to our winners. It was extremely difficult to pick just six names as so many of the entries made us laugh.</p>
      <p>“It was great to see the pupils at the depot today who were so excited and enthusiastic about seeing the name they chose on a gritter, as well as getting the chance to see how the gritter themselves work.</p>
      <p>“As is the case every year, a lot of planning and preparation has gone into making sure the council is ready for winter.</p>
      <p>“Grit stocks have been replenished and staff have the equipment ready to deal with the worst of the weather.”</p>
