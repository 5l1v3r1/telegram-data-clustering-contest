      <h1>Mexico Will Reject U.S. Designations of Cartels as Terrorists, Says AMLO</h1>
      <h2>Mexico’s president announced Monday that he will reject any designation of cartels as terrorist organizations by the U.S. government.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:56:20+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:56</time> by <a rel="author">Ildefonso Ortiz and Brandon Darby</a></address>
      <p>During his morning press conference, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) said he would not accept the U.S.’s potential designation of cartels as foreign terrorist organizations–which could enable direct actions in Mexico.</p>
      <p>“We will never accept that, we are not ‘vendepatrias’ (nation sellers),” Lopez Obrador said.</p>
      <p>The president’s statements come after the relatives of nine U.S. women and children who <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/border/2019/11/05/narco-terror-10-u-s-women-children-murdered-by-cartel-gunmen-near-new-mexico-border/">died in a cartel ambush</a> in Sonora revealed they would be meeting with President Donald Trump. The family is expected to ask for some cartels to be labeled as terrorist organizations.</p>
      <p>Last week, Tamaulipas Governor Francisco Cabeza de Vaca used the term “narco-terrorism” to refer to the brazen attacks on citizens of Nuevo Laredo by a faction of Los Zetas Cartel called Cartel Del Noreste. Cabeza de Vaca publicly called out Mexico City for past inaction in confronting Los Zetas.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/border/2019/11/10/rep-chip-roy-designate-certain-mexican-cartels-as-foreign-terrorist-organizations/">Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) filed legislation for the most violent cartels in Mexico to be labeled as a foreign terrorist organizations</a>, a move that would limit cartel members’ abilities to travel and provide tools to better clamp down on financial transactions, Breitbart Texas reported.</p>
      <p>On Monday morning, Lopez Obrador’s foreign relations minister Marcelo Ebrard called designations unnecessary and inconvenient, adding that the U.S. and Mexico have a healthy working relationship in fighting cartels. According to Ebrard, terrorist designations would give the U.S. the legal avenue to take direct action on cartels on Mexican soil.</p>
