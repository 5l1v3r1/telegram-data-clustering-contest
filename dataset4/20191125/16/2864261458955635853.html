      <h1>Competition bureau has plan to lower cell phone bills across Canada</h1>
      <h2>In areas where the big three – Telus, Bell and Rogers – have a monopoly, prices are higher</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.bashawstar.com/author/katya-slepian/" target="_blank">Katya Slepian</a></address>
      <p>The Competition Bureau is asking the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to help small wireless carriers expand across the country.</p>
      <p>In a Monday morning press release, the bureau said that prices for wireless plans are cheaper all-around in places where regional carriers like Freedom Mobile and Videotron offer services.</p>
      <p>In areas where the big three – Telus, Bell and Rogers – have a monopoly, prices are higher.</p>
      <p>“In regions with wireless disruptors, prices can be 35 to 40% lower,” the bureau said.</p>
      <p>The bureau is recommending the CRTC pursue a “mobile virtual network operator” police where the big three would need to sell temporary access to their networks to regional carriers who plan to further expand their own networks.</p>
      <p>“Wireless prices are significantly lower in areas of Canada where strong regional carriers compete with established national players,” said competition commisioner Matthew Boswell.</p>
      <p>“We recommend that the CRTC introduce a policy that allows regional competitors to expand into new markets to ensure that all Canadians can benefit from lower prices, greater choice and more innovation in wireless services.”</p>
