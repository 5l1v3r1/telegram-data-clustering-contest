      <p>ANKARA: Turkey began testing on Monday its Russian missile defense system, local media reported, despite repeated calls from the United States that it could lead to sanctions.<br/>Planes, including F-16 fighter jets, circled the Murted military base in Ankara province to test the newly acquired S-400 system and train Turkish operators, news agency DHA reported.<br/>Turkey’s acquisition of the S-400 in July was met with consternation by its NATO allies.<br/>The US argues there is a risk that sensitive technological information could be leaked if it is used alongside Western equipment such as the new F-35 jet.<br/>Turkey has ordered 100 F-35s and its defense industry was part of the supply chain for the new jet, until it was kicked off the program due to the S-400 purchase.<br/>So far, the US has appeared reluctant to impose threatened sanctions on Turkey over the purchase, with officials saying it could be spared if it does not activate the S-400 system — though this option has been rejected by Turkey.</p>
