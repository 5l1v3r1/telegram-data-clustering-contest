      <p>The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear! <i>Elf</i> is showing from December 6 for one week only. After inadvertently wreaking havoc on the elf community due to his ungainly size, Buddy who was raised as an elf at the North Pole is sent to the U.S. in search of his true identity.</p>
      <p>Christmas just isn’t Christmas without KEVIN! <i>Home Alone</i> storms back onto the big screen from December 13 for a one week run due to phenomenal demand. Last year <i>Home Alone</i> sold-out screens nationwide in Omniplex, so pre-booking is essential for this one!</p>

      <p>When Kevin McCallister gets his Christmas wish for his family to disappear he is forced to defend his home on his own by decking the halls with ingenious traps to hold his two burglaries at bay until his family makes it home for Christmas.</p>
      <p>Their final Christmas Movie this season is <i>Home Alone 2: Lost in New York</i> back from the 20th – 24th of December including our special 3pm Christmas eve screenings nationwide! In this sequel to the highly successful<i> Home Alone</i>, a precocious Chicago boy (our Kevin!) mistakenly boards a plane to New York while the rest of his large family wings to Florida. In Manhattan, he takes up residence at the Plaza Hotel, but his posh holiday is disrupted by the re-appearance of crooks Harry and Marv.</p>
