      <p>Gergely Dud√°s has mastered the art of the hidden image puzzle. The Hungarian artist, who goes by the name <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/84014/theres-fish-hiding-among-these-octopuses-can-you-spot-it">Dudolf</a> on the web, is famous for his <i>Where's Waldo?</i>-style brainteasers that embed camouflaged objects into playful illustrations. His latest scene is one of his most challenging creations yet.</p>
      <p>The picture below shows dozens of brown squirrels crowded into a tight frame. If you study the image closely enough, you'll notice that one of the squirrels is actually a mouse. Like all of the hidden images in Dudolf's puzzles, the mouse is designed to blend in with its surroundings, making it almost impossible to spot at first glance.</p>

      <p>If you've been staring at the image for a minute or two with no luck, here's a tip: Check the ears to find the animal that doesn't belong. And if that clue doesn't prove helpful, scroll to the bottom of <a href="http://thedudolf.blogspot.com/2019/11/mouse-among-squirrels.html?fbclid=IwAR2Y5bMR5rFtKPV0B2TAs6ZcFN4ZFhvjLk_1ITmACdnslD74uQuNcDKu2AA">this webpage</a> for the answer.</p>
      <p>Dudolf has created visual brainteasers for every time of year.
