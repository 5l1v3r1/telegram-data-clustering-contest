      <h1>Honda absolutely nailed it with the all-new 2020 City Turbo</h1>
      <h2>We can't wait for the 2020 Honda City to be launched here</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:08:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/anton-andres.html" target="_blank">Anton Andres</a></address>
      <p>First it was the Almera. Then, it was the Mirage. Now, it's Honda's turn to stir up the B-segment sedan class with the all-new Honda City. With that, 2020 is starting to look like a very exciting year for subcompact sedans, and, like the Nissan, the fifth-generation City (seventh if you count the hatchback models from the 80's) wades into battle with turbo power.</p>

      <p>Under the hood of the 2020 City is a 1.0-liter, three-cylinder engine, much like the Euro-spec Civic. With the aid of a turbocharger, this engine is good for 122 PS and, more importantly, 173 Nm of torque. So while horsepower is similar to the 1.5-liter i-VTEC mill we have at the moment (120 PS), it makes heaps more torque with a 28 Nm gain from the current model. Like most new Hondas these days, it shifts via a continuously variable transmission. This engine meets Euro 5 emissions, making it greener than before. Honda also claims that it can do up to 23.8 kilometers per liter.</p>

      <p>Like before, the City looks significantly different from the hatchback it's based on, the Jazz. It takes some styling cues from its big brother, the Civic, especially at the front end. Clearly seen is the 'Solid Wing Face' look which sees slim headlights and a bold grill. LED daytime running lights are standard in all variants, much like the current model.</p>

      <p>As for the rest of the car, the roofline is sleeker and swoopier than before, just like the Civic of today. This generation also sees the return of the door-mounted side mirrors, much like the second-generation model. The rear meanwhile is a break from tradition. Instead of the usual C-shaped light clusters, the City has a pair of wraparound tail lights with an LED strip for some added zing. Speaking of zing, the trunk lid has a kicked up design, making it look like it has an integrated lip spoiler.</p>

      <p>Honda says this generation of City is lower and wider than before, giving it a more athletic stance. In Thailand, the City is available in four variants: 1.0 Turbo S, 1.0 Turbo V, 1.0 Turbo SV, and 1.0 Turbo RS.</p>

      <p>Inside, the all-new City is leaps and bounds ahead of the current model. While the instrument cluster is still analogue, the rest of the dash is totally different from what we see now. The dash face is more upright than before, so to is the climate control interface. Also noticeable are the air-conditioning vents, which are now vertical instead of horizontal. And that steering wheel wouldn't look out of place in a Civic, either.</p>

      <p>In the Turbo SV and Turbo RS, the seats are trimmed in leather with the RS getting more leather trimmings throughout the cabin. On the technology front, it has Apple CarPlay and Android Auto available, along with remote engine start.</p>

      <p>At this point, you're probably thinking when Honda Cars Philippines will roll out the 2020 City. So far, there is no word just yet, but we're hoping that it will still be assembled in Santa Rosa, Laguna. It's also uncertain if HCPI will still offer the 1.5-liter engine in base variants, or if they will even bring in the 1.0 Turbo in the country. Fingers crossed, and we hope to see sooner than later.</p>
