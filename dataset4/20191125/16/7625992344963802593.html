      <h1>Morris Meat Packing recalls 250 tons of pork that was never inspected</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:03:12+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:03</time> by <a rel="author">Kate Gibson</a></address>
      <p>Morris Meat Packing is recalling more than half a million pounds of pork products because they were never inspected by the government, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service.</p>
      <p>The problem was discovered after the agency heard from an anonymous tipster that the Maywood, Illinois-based company was selling products without the benefit of federal inspection, the FSIS said in a <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2019/recall-116-2019-release">statement</a>.</p>
      <p>The raw, intact pork pieces were produced on Saturdays over the course of a nearly two-year period, from Nov. 25, 2017, to Nov. 9, 2019, according to the federal agency.</p>
      <p>"At this time we have no comment," Frank Masellis, president of Morris Meat Packing, told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that he could not address the issues involved in the recall until given the go-ahead by his attorney.</p>
      <p>The USDA is concerned that some of the recalled pork could already be in the hands of consumers. The agency says people shouldn't eat any of the products and instead throw them away or return the items to the place of purchase.</p>
      <p>The 49 recalled products have the establishment number "EST. 18267" inside the USDA mark of inspection and were shipped to retailers and distributors in Illinois. Consumers may also call Masellis at (708) 865-8566.</p>
      <p>Asked whether Morris Meat faced any fines or sanctions, a USDA spokesperson declined to comment because there is an ongoing investigation.</p>
