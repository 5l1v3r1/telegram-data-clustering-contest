      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/"><b>Chelsea</b></a> travel to Spain to face <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/valencia/"><b>Valencia</b></a> knowing that they need to avoid defeat in order to remain in a top-two position in Group H.</h2>

      <p>However, Valencia welcome the Premier League giants aware that completing the double over the Blues will put them on the brink of qualifying for the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/"><b>Champions League</b></a> last 16.</p>

      <p>When Chelsea faced Valencia on Matchday One, they were still attempting to adjust to life under <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/frank-lampard/"><b>Frank Lampard</b></a>, and the visitors ultimately managed to prevail at Stamford Bridge after the Blues had failed to build on a promising start.</p>
      <p>However, that disappointment acted as the catalyst for Chelsea to begin to put in better performances in all areas of the pitch, providing them with success on both the domestic and European front.</p>
      <p>They are still far away from their goals in each of the Premier League and Champions League, but there is now belief that his side can continue to perform to the highest level going forward, despite the west Londoners working with a relatively young squad.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/result/result-mahrez-nets-winner-as-man-city-overcome-chelsea_380403.html">losing out 2-1 to Manchester City</a> at the weekend came as a blow, a result which ended a run of six successive wins in the Premier League, Lampard will be satisfied with the level of performance ahead of another testing contest on their travels.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Valencia also saw a strong run of form come to an end on Saturday as they suffered a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Real Betis, their first setback in five games.</p>
      <p>The result has left <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/albert-celades/"><b>Albert Celades</b></a>'s team down in 10th position in the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/la-liga/2019-20/">La Liga standings</a>, although there remains a positive feeling at The Mestalla as Los Che continue to impress under his brief leadership.</p>
      <p>Overturning a half-time deficit to thrash Lille by a 4-1 scoreline on Matchday Four was a particular highlight, and it is a comeback which may make all of the difference come the end of the group.</p>
      <p>Avoiding defeat on Wednesday evening would leave Valencia with a superior head-to-head record over Chelsea, something which may make all of the difference in a hotly-contested group.</p>

      <p>Lampard is likely to hand a recall to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mason-mount/"><b>Mason Mount</b></a> after the England international dropped down to the substitutes' bench at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The playmaker could take the place of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mateo-kovacic/"><b>Mateo Kovacic</b></a>, providing that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ngolo-kante/"><b>N'Golo Kante</b></a> suffered no injury issues against Man City.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andreas-christensen/"><b>Andreas Christensen</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/callum-hudson-odoi/"><b>Callum Hudson-Odoi</b></a> are also pushing for starting roles, although Lampard may opt to keep alterations down to a minimum.</p>
      <p>As for Valencia, Celades could hand a start to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kevin-gameiro/"><b>Kevin Gameiro</b></a>, who only featured off the bench against Betis.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/denis-cheryshev/"><b>Denis Cheryshev</b></a> is closing in on a return from injury, but no risks will be taken on the fitness of the Russia international.</p>
      <p><b>Valencia possible starting lineup:</b> Cillessen; Costa, Gabriel Paulista, Mangala, Gaya; Torres, Parejo, Wass, Vallejo; Gameiro, Gomez</p>
      <p><b>Chelsea possible starting lineup:</b> Arrizabalaga; Azpilicueta, Zouma, Tomori, Palmieri; Kante, Jorginho; Willian, Mount, Pulisic; Abraham</p>

      <h3>We say: Valencia 2-1 Chelsea</h3>
      <p>Both clubs have shown their qualities and frailties this season, which makes this contest a difficult one to call. However, Valencia are generally a tough outfit to beat at The Mestalla, and they could edge this game in the closing stages.</p>
