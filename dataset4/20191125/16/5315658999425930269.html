      <h1>Greenpeace protest unproductive and ill-informed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:16:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party" target="_blank">New Zealand National Party</a></address>
      <p>Greenpeace’s unlawful protest on the Skandi Atlantic in Timaru is misguided and misleading, National’s Energy and Resources spokesperson Jonathan Young says.</p>
      <p>“The drilling being undertaken by the vessel is not for oil as Greenpeace is claiming. It is to unlock further natural gas reserves in a field that has been producing safely in New Zealand for over 50 years</p>
      <p>“The Government’s ill-advised oil and gas ban has meant that New Zealand’s dependence on imported coal instead of natural gases has increased, raising emissions in the process.</p>
      <p>“Greenpeace is trying to push natural gas exploration and production out of New Zealand, but these actions will only increase our dependence on imported coal and raise electricity prices.</p>
      <p>“Natural gas keeps the lights on for New Zealand when our renewable generation isn’t able to.</p>
      <p>“Wholesale electricity prices have already increased by an average of 60 per cent this year, mostly on the back of uncertainty of natural gas supply to electricity generators.</p>
      <p>“National supports peaceful and lawful protest, but does not support boarding a vessel and impeding its lawful activities. I thank the police for responding immediately and expect them to uphold the law, while assuring the safety of all on board the Skandi Atlantic.”</p>
