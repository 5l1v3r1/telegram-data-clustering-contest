      <p>PUNE: If there was any doubt over Indian shooters' performance at the world level this year, here is the validation.</p>
      <p>Three Indians have finished as No.1 in the year-end World rankings and will receive the International Shooting Sports Federation's (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ISSF">ISSF</a>) 'The Golden Target' award.</p>
      <p>From this year, ISSF has started the Golden Target award for the top ranked athletes. The awards will be given to top shooters from 12 categories on December 7 in Munich.</p>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Divyansh-Singh-Panwar">Divyansh Singh Panwar</a> and young <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Elavenil-Valarivan">Elavenil Valarivan</a> have topped the men's and women's 10m air rifle categories respectively, while pistol ace <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/saurabh-chaudhary">Saurabh Chaudhary</a> has ended the year as No. 1 in men's 10m air pistol event.</p>
      <p>Out of the 12 Olympic categories (individual), India has maximum No. 1s, followed by China and USA (2 each).</p>
      <p>Elavenil made her senior World Cup debut this year and finished fourth in the Munich World Cup. She clinched gold in the fourth World Cup at Rio de Janeiro and followed it up by topping the podium at the World Cup Finals in China last week.</p>
      <p>"When I started the year as senior, the only thing I was focused on was the transition from junior category. I had certainly not thought about ending the year as World No. 1 in the senior category. This award has raised expectations and I will have to work harder to maintain my position next year," Elavenil, who trains at Gagan Narang's Gun For Glory academy, told TOI.</p>
      <p>Another junior shooter, Divyansh, who too made his senior debut this year, said the success in 2019 will push him to do well in 2020 too.</p>
      <p>"My target this year was to win an Olympic quota. Once I got that in the Beijing World Cup, I grew in confidence," said Divyansh, who trains under former India shooter and coach Suma Shirur.</p>
      <p>Divyansh won two World Cup gold (Beijing and Munich) along with the World Cup Finals gold.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Saurabh Chaudhary clinched topped the podium in New Delhi and Munich WCs, while he won bronze at Rio. He finished sixth at the World Cup finals.</p>
