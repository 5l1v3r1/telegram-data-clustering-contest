      <h1>Palo Alto Networks Is Set for a Big Upside Breakout</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:29:35+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/author/1668375/bruce-kamich/all.html" target="_blank">BRUCE KAMICH</a></address>
      <p>At the top of the <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/your-game-plan-cramers-mad-money-recap-nov-22-15178756"><i>Mad Money</i> program Friday night</a> Jim Cramer looked ahead to this week's earnings announcements. Monday will bring us Palo Alto Networks (<a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/quote/PANW.html">PANW</a>) . Cramer said Palo Alto Networks should be heading higher. </p>
      <p>The company is scheduled to announce first-quarter fiscal 2020 earnings results after the close Monday. Let's check the charts to see if traders are anticipating a move higher.  </p>
      <p>In the daily bar chart of PANW, below, we can see that there is only a slight amount of overhead resistance for prices to overcome. PANW is above the rising 50-day moving average line as well as the rising 200-day line. The 50-day line is crossing above the slower-to-react 200-day line for what is commonly called a golden cross. This math-driven buy signal is typically late but it can be effective at times.   The trading volume has picked up this month as prices have risen and the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has made new highs this month continuing the uptrend of the past 12 months. A rising OBV line tells us that buyers of PANW have been more aggressive.   The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is well above the zero line but could cross to the downside for a take profits sell signal -- it all depends on the price action ahead.    </p>

      <p>  In the weekly bar chart of PANW, below, we can see that prices are poised to break out of what looks like a large ascending or bullish triangle formation. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.   The weekly OBV line has been in a bullish trend the past three years and close to making a new all time high. The MACD oscillator gave a fresh outright buy signal in October when it crossed above the zero line.    </p>

      <p>  In this Point and Figure chart of PANW, below, we can see a potential upside price target of $339 and very little overhead chart resistance.   </p>

      <p>  <b>Bottom-line strategy: </b>The trend is up ahead of the company's fiscal first-quarter earnings numbers set for release after the close Monday. Hold longs through the report as traders and investors have been buying in recent weeks. A trade at $260.88 on the Point and Figure chart above will mark a significant upside breakout.  </p>
