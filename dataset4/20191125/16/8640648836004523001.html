      <p>Pardee Homes is offering the ultimate in elevated living with the sale of two stunning model homes — Frame and Sky X — in the upscale Axis neighborhood on a terraced hillside in Henderson. Both include swimming pools and spectacular views of the Las Vegas Valley.</p>
      <p>“When we acquired the land where Axis is situated, we challenged ourselves and our team at Bassenian Lagoni Architects in Newport Beach, California, to design an ultra-luxury community showcasing ‘next level’ modern architecture,” Pardee Homes Division President Klif Andrews said. ”The results have exceeded all expectations.”</p>
      <p>Interior Design maven Yolanda Landrum of Yolanda Landrum Interior Design of El Segundo, California, put her mark on both the Frame and Sky X model homes at Axis. Landrum’s award-winning work has been a staple for Pardee Homes in Nevada and Southern California for more than two decades.</p>
      <p>“Creating contemporary environments while still allowing for comfort and luxury in grand settings was my main focus in merchandising these amazing Axis model homes,” Landrum said.</p>
      <p>Homebuyers will have the option of purchasing the designer’s hand-selected furnishings.</p>
      <p>Frame at Axis measures approximately 3,467 square feet in an expansive single-story design with dramatic 14-foot walls at the entry that reveal views to the backyard and beyond, framed by 16 feet of horizontal glass panels that can disappear into a wall pocket, creating an indoor-outdoor vista. The entry is centered, allowing for entertaining on one side and family living on the other. A home theater with bar and refreshment area is included with the three bedrooms and 3½ baths. The Frame model is priced at approximately $1,724,750.</p>
      <p>Angles and edges converge in the majestic Axis Sky X, a modern two-story design with three distinct living areas in approximately 3,761 square feet that lives even larger because of innovative indoor-outdoor orientation.</p>
      <p>A sheltered entry with two-story volume is expansive yet grounded with the same stone carried through from the exterior. Sky X wraps around a center courtyard with each living area having direct outdoor access for the ultimate Southern Nevada indoor-outdoor lifestyle. With three bedrooms, 4½ baths, bonus room and pool lounge, the Sky X model home is priced at approximately $1,724,866.</p>
      <p>With the model home sales, there are a few opportunities remaining to select a homesite and build an Axis home. Tours are available by appointment. Call Pardee Homes home advisers Shannon Marler or Paris Bieber at 702-660-6805.</p>
      <p>Axis is at 2239 Sky Pointe Ridge Drive, off Green Valley Parkway, south of Carnegie Street in Henderson.</p>
