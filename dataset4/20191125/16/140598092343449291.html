      <h1>StubHub is just the ticket for Viagogo after $4bn swoop</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:18:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/james-cook/" target="_blank">James Cook</a></address>
      <p>Viagogo, the ticket reseller condemned by MPs for its misleading sales practices, is buying rival site StubHub from its owner eBay for $4bn (£3bn).</p>
      <p>The auction site paid $310m for the ticket business in 2007 and it has become the largest ticket reseller in the US, with revenues of about $1.1bn last year.</p>
      <p>Eric Baker, chief executive of Viagogo, co-founded StubHub while still in business school but left before it was sold.</p>
      <p>“It has long been my wish to unite the two companies,” he said on Monday and claimed that the deal will give customers “more choice and better pricing”.</p>
      <p>The combined companies will sell hundreds of thousands of tickets a day in more than 70 countries.</p>
      <p>The deal is likely to be welcomed by activist investors such as Paul Singer’s Elliott Management, which has called for eBay to sell divisions including the ticket site.</p>
      <p>“StubHub is non-core to the eBay Marketplace but would command significant value as a market-leading, scale business,” wrote Jesse Cohn, a partner at Elliott, in a letter to eBay’s board in January.</p>
      <p>The hedge fund said that it believed StubHub would be worth about $4bn.</p>
      <p>Representatives from Elliott and Starboard Value joined eBay’s board earlier this year and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/03/01/ebay-could-sell-spin-stubhub-strategic-review/">backed a strategic review</a> which examined ways to improve the company’s finances.</p>
      <p>Ticket resale websites have faced frequent scrutiny by UK regulators and politicians.</p>
      <p>In September the Competitions and Markets Authority suspended legal action against Viagogo after finding that the site had made changes to address concerns that it was not following the law.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/07/04/viagogo-face-legal-action-regulator-ticket-resales/">The watchdog had warned the business</a> that it was not consistently giving information about tickets, including exact seat numbers and a warning that resold tickets may not automatically grant customers entry.</p>
      <p>Cris Miller, managing director, said Viagogo has met with a number of regulators to hear their concerns. </p>
      <p>“What we've been doing over the past year has made over 1,000 changes to the website,” he said. “That includes the messaging on our website to provide more transparency [to] pricing to bring all the fees and everything closer to the first place the customers see the price.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this year MPs warned the public not to buy or sell tickets through Viagogo, which is based in Geneva, until it "fully complies with consumer law".</p>
      <p>The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee criticised the business for what it called “misleading sales practices.”</p>
