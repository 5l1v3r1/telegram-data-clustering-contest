        <b>A submarine loaded with 3,000 kilograms of cocaine passed through Cape Verde and Portuguese waters before being intercepted on Sunday in Galicia, Spain, according to the Spanish regional press.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The vessel, which sailed from Latin America, had on board three crew members, two of whom were arrested on Sunday, while a third managed to escape, according to Spanish Civil Guard sources who do not make statements while the operation is underway.</p>
      <p>The Spanish authorities are trying to gain access to the interior of the submarine, which is stranded on a peninsula in the municipality of Cangas de Morrazo in Galicia.</p>
      <p>Officials from the Civil Guard, the National Police and the Tax Agency are participating in the operation, which is still going on.</p>
      <p>Two Ecuadorean citizens and another Spaniard crossed the Atlantic aboard the vessel, arrived in Cape Verde and then sailed north to Portugal, according to The Voice of Galicia.</p>
      <p>Off Lisbon, the submarine was 40 miles from the coast and sailed parallel to it to Spain.</p>
      <p>The paper said assures that "the Portuguese Judiciary Police were aware and went after them without success" on Saturday, in an operation coordinated by the Center for Analysis and Maritime Operations in Narcotics (Maoc-N), an international organisation based in Lisbon.</p>
      <p>The Spanish authorities were trying to float the twenty-metre long submarine late on Sunday, as it had been washed ashore on Saturday night and was submerged.</p>
      <p>According to the Galician press, those responsible for the operation estimate that it will take several hours for the submarine to float again and for the exact amount of drugs, estimated at between 3,000 and 3,500 kilograms, to be verified.</p>
      <p>The investigators are also trying to clarify whether the submarine sailed from South America to Spain with the cargo or whether the drug was introduced into the vehicle at some point on the high seas, a drug transport system common in America but not widely used in Europe.</p>
