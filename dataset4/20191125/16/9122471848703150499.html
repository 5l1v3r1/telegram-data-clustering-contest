      <h1>Tennessee QB Jarrett Guarantano Reveals He Got Death Threats Earlier This Season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:02:27+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>After a 2-5 start that included losses to Georgia State and BYU, Tennessee has ripped off four straight wins to become bowl eligible in Jeremy Pruitt’s second season at the helm. Quarterback Jarrett Guarantano’s play has been a major reason why.</p>
      <p>Guarantano entered the season as the starter, but has been battling with freshman Brian Maurer for playing time since late September. This past Saturday, he started and played incredibly well in his team’s victory over Missouri, throwing for 415 yards with two touchdowns.</p>
      <p>After the game, Gaurantano told reporters that earlier this season, he received death threats. He praised his teammates for being there for him. <a href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/sports/college/university-of-tennessee/football/2019/11/23/tennessee-vols-football-jarrett-guarantano-missouri-death-threats/4289507002/">Via knoxnews.com:</a></p>
      <blockquote>“There were so many guys that were there for me throughout the death threats, the mean messages to the sister,” Guarantano said. “They were all there for me, and it really meant a lot. There were some hectic times for me, and they were there for me every step on the way.”</blockquote>
      <p>This isn’t the first quarterback to reveal he’s gotten death threats this year. Penn State’s Sean Clifford said he got the same treatment <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/penn-state-nittany-lions/james-franklin-sean-clifford-death-threats-reaction">after his team’s loss to Minnesota.</a></p>
      <p>Tennessee’s win ensures the Vols a bowl berth regardless of what happens against rival Vanderbilt this year. That said, they can finish with a winning record if they can take down the Commodores. They can also finish with a 5-3 mark in the SEC.</p>
      <p>Tennessee will play in a bowl game for the first time since 2016.</p>
      <p>The Vols will finish up their season at home against Vanderbilt on Saturday at 4:00 PM ET on the SEC Network.</p>
