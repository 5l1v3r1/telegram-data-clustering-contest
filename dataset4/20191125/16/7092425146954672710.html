          <b>Two Irish restaurants feature on a new list which has determined the 50 Best Burgers in the World.</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.burgerdudes.se/"><b><i>Burgerdudes</i></b></a>, the self-proclaimed world's leading burger website, have spent half a decade searching for the world’s best hamburger, resulting in 400 reviews from over 50 countries.</p>
      <p>The Swedish site celebrated its fifth anniversary last month and decided to mark the occasion by putting together <a href="https://www.burgerdudes.se/the-worlds-50-best-burgers/"><b><i>a comprehensive list ranking the greatest burgers in the world.</i></b></a></p>
      <p>The feature is a handpicked rundown of the best hamburgers those behind the site have eaten. Their top restaurants include everything from street food vendors to finer establishments, but they all share the same respect for the ingredients that are required in order to create an amazing burger.</p>
      <p>20 countries make the top 50, with two Irish restaurants making the cut.</p>

      <p>Coming in at number 44 is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bunsen&amp;oq=Bunsen&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j35i39j0j69i60j69i61l2.1311j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><b><i>Bunsen</i></b></a>, which opened its first restaurant in 2013 and now has locations in Belfast, Cork and Dublin.</p>
      <p>Describing the popular burger joint, Burgerdudes write: "Their cheeseburger with hand-cut fries didn’t disappoint one bit. Our medium cooked burger was served in no time, wrapped in some paper that made sure that everything was nice and gooey.</p>
      <p>"The fluffy bun was perfectly toasted, keeping everything in place, and everything tasted great. We especially liked the patty with its charred outside and juicy centre. And all of the ingredients worked really well together without taking over.</p>
      <p>"Definitely one of the finest specimens in Ireland."</p>

      <p>Also featuring on the list is <a href="https://handsomeburger.com/"><b><i>Handsome Burger</i></b></a>, which was founded by friends Rory McCormack and Cathal O’Connor. The pair started out as a pop-up stall in 2017 before getting their break working out of the kitchens of Woodquay’s craft pup Caribou in Galway.</p>
      <p>Their burgers proved a massive hit with Galwegians and they opened up their own restaurant on Dominick Street before expanding to Dublin with their own vendor at EatYard at the Bernard Shaw.</p>
      <p>Writing about their experience at the restaurant, Burgerdudes say "the amazing meat had a deeply beefy flavour, and the other ingredients – such as super intensive Derg cheddar and delectable bacon – were bold without taking over too much.</p>
      <p>"We also liked the sturdy bun that kept everything in place. This is definitely the best burger we’ve had from the Emerald Isle."</p>

      <p>It's no surprise to see Handsome Burger ranked as Ireland's best burger joint, with <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/food-drink/national-burger-day-free-burger-329833"><b><i>the restaurant named the country's best providers of burgers back in June. </i></b></a></p>
      <p>With over 20,000 votes cast Handsome Burger won the grand prize on National Burger Day after coming in as runner up last year at the inaugural competition.</p>
      <p>Coming in at Number One in Burgerdudes' 50 Best Burgers in the World list is Emily in New York, which remarkably only has one burger on their menu – the “Emmy Burger” - which costs a whooping $26 including fries.</p>
      <p>But according to Burgerdudes, "eating it is as close as you’ll come to burger heaven" with the meal consisting of a slightly toasted pretzel bun from the Tom Cat bakery, 30 day dry-aged beef from the butcher Pat LaFrieda, a 12 month aged Grafton cheddar, caramelized onions, pickles and their bespoke Emmy sauce".</p>
