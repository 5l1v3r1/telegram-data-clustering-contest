      <h3>Save $500 on an Asus gaming laptop with this great Black Friday deal</h3>
      <p>This 1660 Ti-powered laptop comes with an i7 processor</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/best-2019-black-friday-deals">Black Friday</a> is a great time to pick up a gaming laptop, but it's easy to end up with a machine that's slightly below your ideal specifications when you take the cost too low. It's all about a balance, between the best hardware you can get, while not spending too much. </p>
      <p>Asus' 1660 Ti-equipped 17.3-inch gaming laptop has been discounted by $500 over on Best Buy, taking it from around $1,399 to $899. And the specs are pretty competitive, with a ninth generation Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM and a decent 512GB solid state drive to store your games. This is marked under Best Buy's 'Black Friday price now' tag, which explains the hefty saving. Note that it's a 1080p laptop:</p>

      <p>Note that it's a 1080p laptop, in case you were after something that supported higher resolutions. What's missing from the specifications on Best Buy (and the <a href="https://www.asus.com/us/ROG-Republic-Of-Gamers/ROG-Strix-G/wheretobuy/">Asus site listing for this laptop</a>) is the refresh rate on the screen for this particular unit. In the Q&amp;A section of the listing, though, <b>numerous responses point out it's got a 60Hz display</b>. It would be handy if all that information was laid out in the specs. Nonetheless, if those specs sound like they suit your gaming needs, that's a big discount.</p>
