      <p>According to reports, Ray J and his wife Princess Love are reportedly gearing up for divorce, as the two haven’t been able to work out issues they publicly have gone through for the past week. Princess Love said Ray J allegedly left her and their daughter stranded in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>Since then, Princess Love commented on the situation, saying, “A man will have a whole wife, kid, and baby on the way and start an argument..just to go to his other hotel room to party with escorts and strippers. What’s in the dark always comes to light. SMH.”</p>
      <p>Before that, Ray J posted a photo of him and his family at the Soul Train Awards, which prompted Princess to comment on the post by saying, “Left me and Melody stranded in Vegas and blocked me from calling.. now you wanna post family photos 😂 #ByeUgly.”</p>
