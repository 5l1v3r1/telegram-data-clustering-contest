      <h1>Dad of former X-Factor contestant quits Welsh council</h1>
      <h2>Darren Macey served as a Plaid Cymru councillor for Ynyshir and Wattstown but wants to take up a role which means he can't continue as a councillor</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:16:20+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:16</time> by <a rel="author">Anthony Lewis</a></address>
      <p>A by-election will be held for the Ynyshir seat on <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/rhondda-cynon-taf-council">Rhondda Cynon Taf Council</a> after a councillor stepped down due to taking on a new role.</p>
      <p>Councillor Darren Macey of <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/plaid-cymru">Plaid Cymru</a> was elected to represent Ynyshir and Wattstown on the council in 2017.</p>
      <p>But due to taking up a role as historian and principal officer on the RCT Sporting Heroes 1800-2021 project he has been forced to stand down as a councillor.</p>
      <p>Mr Macey is the father of <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/x-factors-lloyd-macey-cant-13961148">former X-Factor contestant Lloyd Macey</a> .</p>

      <p>Darren Macey said: “It is with great regret that I have to step down from my duties as councillor for Ynyshir and Wattstown.</p>
      <p>“As some of you may be aware I’ve been involved in the RCT Sporting Heroes 1800-2021 and have been offered the opportunity of leading the project as its historian and principal officer.</p>
      <p>“I am however informed that taking this post will debar me from continuing as a councillor.</p>
      <p>"The opportunity to support my family, further my career as a historian, and follow in the footsteps of four generations of my family working at the Lewis Merthyr Pit is one I cannot pass up.</p>
      <p>“I hope everyone can understand my decision and I’d like to once again say how honoured I’ve been to represent our community.</p>
      <p>“I will of course continue to play an active role in the St Anne’s Church renovation initiative and in other community projects.</p>
      <p>“Can I again thank you all for your help and support over the last couple of years.”</p>
      <p>Adrian Parry will be standing for Plaid Cymru in the by-election which is scheduled to take place on Thursday, December 5.</p>
      <p>Julie Edwards is the only other candidate and she will be standing for the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour Party.</a></p>
