      <h1>Paul Finebaum Takes A Jab At Jim Harbaugh Before Ohio State-Michigan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:35:40+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Jim Harbaugh <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/espn-reporter-reveals-what-jim-harbaugh-told-her-at-halftime">was mocked at halftime</a> of the Penn State-Michigan game for saying the Wolverines were about to have their “finest hour.” The Wolverines lost that game, but nearly pulled off an impressive comeback in State College. Michigan has been dominant since, too.</p>
      <p>So, perhaps Harbaugh was right. The Wolverines have won five games in a row and enter Saturday’s game vs. Ohio State with serious confidence.</p>
      <p>ESPN analyst Paul Finebaum has long been a critic of Harbaugh, but even he is impressed with the Wolverines’ recent play.</p>
      <p>“It would be a tremendous win. Again, Harbaugh was written off a couple of weeks ago, and I know, because I did,” <a href="https://saturdaytradition.com/big-ten-football/paul-finebaum-weighs-in-on-ohio-state-michigan-impact-on-cfb-playoff-jim-harbaughs-future/">Finebaum said on WJOX Monday</a>. “It would be more important to him than in the College Football Playoff scheme. I think that game would be seen as as good a loss as you could have for Ohio State. So, I think the Penn State game was the critical game for Ohio State.”</p>
      <p>It wasn’t all praise from Finebaum, though.</p>
      <p>He got in a jab, too:</p>
      <p>“Harbaugh beats to his own drummer. If he wins this game, he’s probably good for five years of up and down and mostly mediocre football,” Finebaum added.</p>
      <p>Harbaugh might be good for five more years if he can beat 11-0 Ohio State for the first time on Saturday. He’s 0-4 against the Buckeyes so far.</p>
      <p>Ohio State and Michigan are set to kick off at noon E.T. on FOX.</p>
