      <p>NCP MLAs Anil Patil and Daulat Daroda recount exclusively to India Today what happened between Friday night and Monday morning until they came back to Mumbai after being whisked away to Delhi by Ajit Pawar.</p>
      <p>"Ajit dada called us all at night and told us that all MLAs have to meet at 7 am on Saturday. He was our leader of the party and so it is our responsibility to reach when he ordered. So we reached the bungalow and we were told to get into the vehicle," Anil Patil said.</p>
      <p>"Until the vehicle reached Raj Bhavan we did not know that we were heading there. On reaching, within 15 minutes, the National Anthem played and the swearing-in took place, and the National Anthem was played again," he said</p>
      <p>He added that after the swearing-in, Ajit Pawar told that "we have to make a government that would last five years. It would be difficult to form a three-party government and there would be no certainty that it would last for long. So we have to form the government with two parties."</p>
      <p>"We were ready as we were under the impression that it was blessed by NCP supremo Sharad Pawar. We were then asked to go ahead and were told that other NCP MLAs would follow suit," he added.</p>
      <p>Patil added that the MLAs do not speak directly with Sharad Pawar most of the time and coordinate through Ajit Pawar, so they thought his decision is what the party wanted. He said that Ajit Pawar also said that the party was in the loop.</p>
      <p>"We faced allegations like that of being called a rebel. We were called by our leader and Ajit Pawar was the leader. So when we went to meet him, how can we be called rebels? But when we got to know of the situation we returned to the fold. We have even told Ajit Pawar that for us the decision of Sharad Pawar is what matters," Patil said.</p>
      <p>"When we reached Delhi we did not know anyone. Some BJP leaders met us there. There were too many people at the airport and we rushed and sat in the car and reached the hotel in Gurugram. But we saw many police officers in plain clothes. Even senior-level police officers were there. Earlier, we thought they must be visitors at the hotel but it was only the next day that we realised that they were security personnel," Patil added.</p>
      <p>Patil said that as soon as the MLAs understood the situation, they contacted party leaders and Sharad Pawar assured them that they will be brought back. "So we waited for some party workers to reach us. The local NCP workers advised us how to reach the lift, get out of the hotel and take a particular road. So within 3-4 minutes, we came out of the hotel," he said.</p>
      <p>Daulat Daroda said, "We were not in touch with any other party. We had called up Sharad Pawar and Supriya Sule from there and they assured us that."</p>
      <p>"We have won the election on the symbol of NCP. Sharad Pawar is the boss and he is our leader. The whip issued by Sharad Pawar will be followed, his order is enough for us," he said.</p>
