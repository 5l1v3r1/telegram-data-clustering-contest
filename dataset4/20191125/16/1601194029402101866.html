      <p>It's not too easy to get into the good books of Vince McMahon but a previously underappreciated NXT Superstar has managed to do exactly that. Yes, you guessed it right. <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/vince-mcmahon">Vince McMahon</a> likes <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/keith-lee">Keith Lee</a> a lot and the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">NXT</a> Superstar was rewarded for his efforts with a big push at Survivor Series.</p>
      <p>Lee was one of the final two survivors in the Elimination tag team match at Survivor Series before he was pinned by Roman Reigns.</p>
      <p>A report from WrestlingNews.co has revealed the backstage reaction to Keith Lee's metronomic rise.</p>
      <p>The report states that Lee is one of those talents who doesn't complain and always shows up to get the job done. The 35-year-old was described as one of the hardest working Superstars on the roster and everyone is genuinely happy to see him get the deserved recognition.</p>
      <p>It was also stated that Vince is a fan of Lee and that the Superstar could end up being on either RAW or SmackDown in a few months.</p>
      <p>Another <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> source told <a href="https://wrestlingnews.co/wwe-news/backstage-wwe-survivor-series-news-on-what-people-are-saying-about-keith-lee">WrestlingNews.co</a> that he would like to see Lee win one of the major main roster titles. The source even added that putting Lee in a feud with Brock Lesnar is a good idea as the NXT Superstar comes across as a believable contender to take the Beast Incarnate down.</p>
      <p>Lee could even be paired up with a manager before he goes on a lengthy reign with the title.</p>
      <p>Here's what the sources revealed in the report:</p>
      <blockquote>“He doesn’t complain and he shows up to do the work. We all know how good he is and this was his night to show everyone what he can do. Vince likes him and I think he’ll be on RAW or SmackDown in a few months.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"I would put one of the main belts on him. If they don’t want to beat Bray then put him in there with Brock. I think people can believe Keith can beat Brock. He has what Vince is looking for. I would maybe give him a manager and give him a long run as champion. He works as hard or harder than anyone and never b***hes or complains about anything. I’m so happy for him.”</blockquote>
      <p>The report also stated that the company was happy with NXT's strong showing at Survivor Series and that the Yellow brand is expected to beat AEW this week in the TV rating war.</p>
      <p>As for Keith Lee, the former PWG World Champion has a bright future ahead of him.</p>
