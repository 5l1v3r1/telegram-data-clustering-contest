Angels on Parade’s 2019 LAFC Defender of the Year poll has closed, and the results might be surprising. Running away with Defender of the Year this year was Steven Beitashour, who got 54% percent of the vote, as selected by you, the readers. Despite a few injury issues throughout the season, Beita put in another solid shift as right back for the team, and he has been one of the most consistent players for LAFC since the team debuted. Coming in second with 27% of the vote was Tristan Blackmon. Blackmon really came into his own this season, filling in at right back and center back at times and performing well when he got the chance.

      <p>Angels on Parade’s 2019 LAFC Defender of the Year poll has closed, and the results might be surprising.</p>
      <p>Running away with Defender of the Year this year was Steven Beitashour, who got 54% percent of the vote, as selected by you, the readers.</p>
      <p>Despite a few injury issues throughout the season, Beita put in another solid shift as right back for the team, and he has been one of the most consistent players for LAFC since the team debuted.</p>
      <p>Coming in second with 27% of the vote was Tristan Blackmon. Blackmon really came into his own this season, filling in at right back and center back at times and performing well when he got the chance. Expect to see his name on the list more in the future.</p>
      <p>3rd place was Jordan Harveywith 8% of the vote. Like Beitashour, Harvey is a key veteran presence and performed well at the left back slot in 2019.</p>
      <p>In 4th place was Eddie Segura with 6% of the vote. Segura helped solidify the center of defense for LAFC in what was one of the few weak areas of the team in 2018.</p>
      <p>Rounding out the top 5 with 4% of the vote was Walker Zimmerman. It’s surprising to see Zimmerman this low, as he performed well again this season and made the MLS Best XI. Still, the voters have spoken and Zimmerman had tough competition along the back line this year.</p>
