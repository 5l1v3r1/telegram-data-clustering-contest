      <h1>Martin replaces Roberto as Manuel Pellegrini must make changes for West Ham's trip to Chelsea</h1>
      <h2>The Hammers continued their dreadful run of form at the weekend and it doesn't get any easier this Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>Manuel Pellegrini takes his free-falling West Ham side to the opposite side of the capital on Saturday as they face Chelsea in the Premier League at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>The Hammers stretched their winless run to seven games in the league at the weekend as they were beaten 3-2 by Spurs at London Stadium in Jose Mourinho's first game in charge.</p>
      <p>The visitors raced into a 2-0 lead by half time and 3-0 shortly after when Harry Kane headed home before the hosts late rally made the scoreline more respectable even if the performance wasn't.</p>
      <p>Goals from the returning Michail Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna were not enough to stop the rot Pellegrini's side find themselves in as their plummet down the standings continues - the Hammers are just three points off the Premier League relegation zone.</p>
      <p>Ogbonna's recall to the starting eleven in place of Fabian Balbuena was long overdue as Pellegrini finally dispensed with the out of form Paraguayan and replaced him with Ogbonna, who shouldn't have been axed in the first place.</p>
      <p>There will be plenty of calls for more changes to be made when West Ham face Frank Lampard's side this weekend, who lost to Man City last time out but have been on a very good run over the alst couple of months.</p>
      <p>So what could they be?</p>
      <p>

      </figure>
      <p>There has to be a change in goal for the Hammers after Roberto made yet another mistake at the weekend, arguably two, and they just keep adding up.</p>
      <p>Son Heung-min's goal in the first half was pretty close to the Spaniard and it still beat him, Harry Kane's header went through the stopper as well.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini can't keep persisting with his error-prone stopper, despite what the alternatives are. Whether that is bringing in third-string keeper David Martin, signed on a free from Millwall this summer, or even U23 gloveman Joseph Anang, he can't stick by Roberto anymore with Lukasz Fabianski still around a month away from a return.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Defence</b>
      </p>
      <p>There will be an enforced change to the back four on Saturday as centre back Issa Diop will be suspended having picked up his fifth yellow card of the season against Spurs, meaning he misses one match.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini chose to shift Declan Rice to centre half against Spurs when he took Diop off, rather than bringing on Balbuena so that could be a clue to his thinking for the Blues game.</p>
      <p>The rest of the back four - Ryan Fredericks, Aaron Cresswell and Ogbonna, should remain in tact. Pellegrini needs to decide whether to play Rice or Balbuena alongside Ogbonna.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Midfield</b>
      </p>
      <p>Should Rice be moved into centre half, then another midfielder would have to come and logic dictates that would be Carlos Sanchez as he is a defensive midfielder but prior to his 25 minute appearance on Saturday, had only played 14 Premier League minutes prior to that.</p>
      <p>Mark Noble could play more defensive but that limits him massively, a wildcard would be Pablo Zabaleta in there but that's highly unlikely. Pellegrini isn't likely to call up Conor Coventry from the U23s either.</p>
      <p>If he chooses Balbuena at centre half then this talk is all mute as Rice and Noble should keep their places.</p>
      <p>On the wings, again, there are big calls.</p>

        <figcaption>Tottenham defender Davinson Sanchez vies with Felipe Anderson<cite>(Image: ADRIAN DENNIS/AFP via Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Felipe Anderson is woefully out-of-form, goalless through 14 games this season and really struggling, summed up when he was hooked at half time against Spurs and had groans of exasperation in the crowd as he bottled a 50-50 tackle in the first half.</p>
      <p>Michail Antonio is only just back from injury but made a massive impact against Spurs, scoring and generally being a nuisance, so he has to come in but there is a risk as he's only had 45 minutes of game time since August.</p>
      <p>On the opposite flank as well, Andriy Yarmolenko was anonymous at the weekend and his form has declined quickly after a lively start.</p>
      <p>Who comes in? That's the problem, there's not many options. Nathan Holland can't do much more than what he is already doing for the U23s but isn't getting a look in, Pablo Fornals isn't a winger and Grady Diangana is at West Brom.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Striker</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sebastien Haller should continue to lead the line despite him also being woefully out of form with just one goal since August and not looking like scoring at the moment.</p>
      <p>Albian Ajeti didn't get off the bench on Saturday despite the Hammers chasing the game and, well, that's the options.</p>
