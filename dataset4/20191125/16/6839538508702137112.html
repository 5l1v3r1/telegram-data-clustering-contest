      <p>Police are hoping a $500,000 reward will help solve the seven-year investigation into the murder of a Queensland father.</p>
      <p>John Lazzaro was gunned down execution-style at his home in Rochedale, south of Brisbane, in 2012 in front of his 19 year-old daughter, who was unharmed.</p>
      <p>Police believe at least two people were involved in the crime.</p>
      <p>More than 150 statements have been taken but police are no closer to solving the case, says Detective Inspector Mark White.</p>
      <p>"We are hoping that (the reward) is going to be an incentive for people if they do have information, to reconsider whether they sit on that information or if they contact the police and come forward," he said.</p>
      <p>"I'm convinced someone in the community knows and can assist us, and that is why we are appealing for that person or persons to come forward and help us out."</p>
      <p>The intruders also shot the 56-year-old's Rottweiler-cross, Kilo, in the back but the dog survived.</p>
      <p>Police found empty shell casings and a hand-gun when they searched Mr Lazzaro's Priestdale Road home after his murder.</p>
