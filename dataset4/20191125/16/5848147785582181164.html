      <h1>Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young wins defamation case against David Leyonhjelm</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:28:34+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/claire-campbell/" target="_blank">Claire Campbell</a></address>
      <p>Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young has won a defamation case against former senator David Leyonhjelm after he made comments suggesting she was a misandrist and a hypocrite.</p>
      <p>Senator Hanson-Young previously told the court she felt <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2018/07/05/hanson-young-defamation-leyonhjelm/">bullied and intimidated</a> when the comments were made in the Senate chamber, and again during media interviews in June and July of 2018.</p>
      <p>She also said Mr Leyonhjelm repeatedly, falsely claimed she had said all men were rapists during a debate about self-defence.</p>
      <p>Mr Leyonhjelm said Ms Hanson-Young interjected during the debate and used words to the effect of “all men are rapists”, which prompted him to fire back and make the comments.</p>
      <p>Justice Richard White on Monday ordered Mr Leyonhjelm to pay $120,000 in damages.</p>

      <p>The matter will return to court in December to discuss who will pay the legal costs.</p>
      <p>In November last year, Mr Leyonhjelm lost a bid to have the defamation case against him thrown out.</p>
      <p>He quit the Senate in February.</p>
      <p>During the trial, Senator Hanson-Young’s barrister Sue Chrysanthou told the court Mr Leyonhjelm had concocted her client’s alleged statement.</p>
      <p>Mr Leyonhjelm denied that, but also admitted he could not remember the exact words Senator Hanson-Young had used and that he left it out of his affidavit because he could not be “categorical in his certainty”.</p>
      <p>The former senator conceded his discussions with colleagues after the Senate interaction may have influenced his memory of the words used.</p>
      <p>Senator Hanson-Young told the court she felt she was bullied and “set upon”.</p>
      <p>“I felt I was being punished for standing up for myself,” she said.</p>
