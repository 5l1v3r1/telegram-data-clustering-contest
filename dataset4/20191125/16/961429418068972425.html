        <b>Listen to the HSJ Health Check manifesto special — we bring you a bonus extra podcast examining election proposals from the three main UK parties on health and care, covering funding, staffing and reform.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The political parties’ manifestos are now all published, with lots to say about what they would do for health and social care.</p>
      <p>In this HSJ Health Check the team examines proposals from the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats.</p>
      <p>We discuss proposals across three big themes: funding, workforce and reform.</p>
      <p>Taking part are <i>HSJ </i>editor Alastair McLellan, integration correspondent Sharon Brennan, and bureau chief for efficiency and performance Ben Clover; and <i>HSJ </i>deputy editor Dave West hosts.</p>
