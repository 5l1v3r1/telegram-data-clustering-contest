      <p>When they tried to get her back, the woman tucked the pooch under her jacket and started shouting they were trying to rob her.</p>
      <p>This led to other members of the public holding Chris and Laila back - with the thief escaping on a bus.</p>
      <p>The family are offering a a £500 reward to anyone that can come forward with information.</p>
      <p>Cops have confirmed they received a report of a theft and are investigating.</p>
      <p>Laila took to Facebook to urge others to be on the lookout.</p>
      <p>She said: "Please if you see a doggy like her please shout 'Tinkerbell’ and if she turns round it’s her, so if that happens please phone police and try to keep track of her til police turn up.</p>

      <p>"You cannot mistake her. People we don’t know constantly shout ‘Hi Tinkerbell.</p>
      <p>"I’m trying to tell myself that even if I never see her again hopefully she’ll be sold to a nice family who will treat her well but Chris keeps saying ‘imagine what she’s going through right now!</p>
      <p>"They’re not Guna feed her, she’ll be missing us and Marley and Diesel’.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"I hope she’s found but despite her unique appearance I doubt there’s much hope.</p>
      <p>"I’ll even pay for her safe return. I don’t care what it costs, I just want my baby back."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Police Scotland said: "Police were called at around 7.10pm on Sunday November 24 to reports of a theft of a dog at Princes Street, Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>"Enquiries are ongoing."</p>
