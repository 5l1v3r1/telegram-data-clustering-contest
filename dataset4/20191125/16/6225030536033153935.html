      <p>With <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Pink_Lloyd">Pink Lloyd</a></b> a winner of 19 stakes races after claiming Woodbine's Kennedy Road (G2) over the weekend, trainer Robert Tiller asked Monday, “What do you do for an encore, you know?”</p>
      <p>In a conversation with “<b><a href="https://stevebyk.com/">At the Races</a></b>” radio show host Steve Byk, Tiller said Pink Lloyd, the 7-year-old gelding in line for a second Canadian Horse of the Year nod, could star in more shows next year.</p>
      <p>“He’s going to get a rest now, and we’ll try to get him there for the spring,” Tiller told Byk. “Any race could be his last race. We know that. We accept that. But I don’t think the party’s over yet. I really don’t.”</p>
      <p>Pink Lloyd went 6-for-6 this season, with the only hiccup coming in the Bold Venture (G3) two starts back. He hit the wire fourth but was declared a non-starter for trying to break through the gate, then emerging slowly.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s Kennedy Road trip wasn’t smooth, either. Last of eight into the turn, Pink Lloyd spun out wide to circle most of his rivals. With only a stubborn Extravagant Kid to beat down on the inside, jockey Eurico Rosa Da Silva — retiring at the end of the Woodbine meet — stood and celebrated in the irons once Pink Lloyd wore him down to win.</p>
      <p>“He’s an icon, that’s for sure,” Tiller told Byk. “He’s something else.”</p>
      <p>The son of Old Forester capped his second career perfect season after running without a defeat in 2017 on his way to a a Horse of the Year vote. There are cases to be made for other contenders in 2019, namely Starship Jubilee, the recent E. P. Taylor (G1) heroine appearing Thursday in Churchill Downs’ Cardinal Stakes (G3). She has run at and won at a higher level, but also lost three races along the way.</p>
      <p>Entourage Stable’s Pink Lloyd capped a campaign that stretched from May to November, with three of his victories in graded company.</p>
      <p>“It’s amazing that a horse can stay that good that long and be as good as he was four years ago,” Tiller said. “We’re going to try and get a few more wins out of him next year, then we’re going to accept the fact that all good things come to an end. I’m already ready for that.”</p>
