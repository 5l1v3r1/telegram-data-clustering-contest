      <h1>Supreme Court rejects new trial for 'Serial' podcast inmate</h1>

      <p>The US Supreme Court on Monday turned down a request for a new trial for a man convicted of his ex-girlfriend's 1999 murder -- a case that received worldwide attention thanks to the hit podcast "Serial."</p>
      <p>The highest US court declined, without comment, to take up the case of Adnan Syed, who was convicted in 2000 of the murder of 18-year-old Hae Min Lee.</p>
      <p>The decision effectively leaves in place a ruling by the Maryland Court of Appeals, which reinstated Syed's conviction after a lower court had ordered a new trial.</p>
      <p>Syed, 39, is serving a life sentence for the murder of Lee, whose body was found buried in February 1999 in a shallow grave in the woods of Baltimore, Maryland. She had been strangled.</p>
      <p>Syed has steadfastly declared his innocence and the case earned new attention when it was taken up by "Serial," a weekly podcast that saw a US journalist revisit the case and cast doubt on his guilt.</p>
      <p>Syed's case has also been the subject of a four-part documentary on the HBO channel called "The Case Against Adnan Syed."</p>
      <p>Maryland's Court of Special Appeals ordered a retrial of the case on the grounds that Syed's lawyer had been ineffective and had failed to contact a potential alibi witness who claimed she saw him in a public library at the time of the murder.</p>
      <p>The Maryland Court of Appeals threw out that argument, however, and the case went to the Supreme Court for consideration.</p>
      <p>The "Serial" podcast -- a mix of investigative journalism, first-person narrative and dramatic storytelling -- focused its first season on Syed's story in 12 nail-biting episodes.</p>
      <p>Both Syed and Lee were high school honor students and children from immigrant families -- he Pakistani, she South Korean -- who had concealed their relationship from their conservative parents.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said during the trial that Syed was a "scorned lover" who felt humiliated after Lee broke up with him.</p>
      <p>Syed's attorney, C. Justin Brown, said he was "deeply disappointed" that the Supreme Court declined to take up the case.</p>
      <p>"But by no means is this the end," Brown told The Baltimore Sun newspaper. He said legal options remain but did not say what they were.</p>
