      <h1>Production Rimac C_Two Will Have A Different Name</h1>
      <h2>We also now know when the production Rimac C_Two will be unveiled.</h2>

      <p>It's been over 18 months since the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/rimac/c-two">Rimac C_Two</a> was unveiled, a successor to the radical <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/rimac/concept-one">Rimac Concept One</a> that nearly <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/here-s-how-rimac-made-the-c-two-hypercar-richard-hammond-proof">killed Richard Hammond</a>. Since then, the electric supercar segment has heated up, with new models such as the Pininfarina Battista and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/lotus/evija">Lotus Evija</a> offering mind-blowing performance. Rimac will soon come back fighting, however.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/rimac-concept-two-has-nearly-2-000-hp-on-tap">C_Two shown at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show was a prototype</a>, but according to <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/mate-rimac-ctwo-progress-and-opening-british-rd-centre">Autocar, </a>the production model will debut at next year's Geneva show in March. While it will still be closely related to the C_Two, the production model will have a different name. Rimac hasn't decided what it will be called yet, however. "I can't tell you what it's called yet", said company founder Mate Rimac. "We haven't decided yet."</p>

      <p>As well as a new name, the production Rimac C_Two will feature a less complex single-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission compared to the prototype's two-speed unit thanks to improvements made to the electric motor design.</p>
      <p>According to Rimac, production of the C_Two will begin by the end of the year, with 40-50 examples rolling off the production line each year. The production model will weigh around 4,409 pounds, which is around the same curb weight as a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bugatti/chiron">Bugatti Chiron</a>. That may seem on the heavy side, but 1,543 pounds of the car's total weight is the 120kWh battery.</p>

      <p>Rimac hasn't said if the production model will boast improved performance, but the C_Two is hardly underpowered. Four electric motors produce a combined 1,914 horsepower and 1,696 lb-ft of torque, allowing the electric hyperarc to sprint from 0-62 mph in just 1.85 seconds and 0-186 mph in 11.8 seconds. Despite its impressive performance, the C_Two also delivers a respectable electric driving range of 342 miles based on the WLTP cycle. Rimac also promises the electric hypercar will be "liveable with" thanks to its spacious cabin that's easy to access.</p>
      <p>Rimac has also announced a deal with the London-based HR Owen dealer group to sell the electric hypercar in the UK, as well as plans to open a research and development center in the UK.</p>
