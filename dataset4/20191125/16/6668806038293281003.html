      <p>Recently, Meghna Gulzar attended the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) and spoke about what we can expect from Deepika in her next project. The director said the audience will see a completely new version of the actress not just in terms of prosthetics but the body language, the gestures and the general energy. She also went on to explain as to why she chooses certain scripts. She said, “I want to tell unconventional stories and I wish the story goes as far and wide as possible. I try and get people who are the mainstream faces and voices to help the film travel. I have been fortunate that those people have agreed to come on board and taken the story wider than it could have gone.”<br/><br/>Bankrolled by Fox Star Studios, Chhapaak is all set to hit the screens on January 10, 2020. The film will also star Vikrant Massey in a leading role.</p>
