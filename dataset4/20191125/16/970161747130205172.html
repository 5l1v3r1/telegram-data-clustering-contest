        <b>Adnan Syed has been denied the right to a new trial by the Supreme Court this week, creating another blow in his ongoing murder conviction appeal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Serial season one subject has been serving a life sentence since 2000 for the murder of his high school girlfriend Hae Min Lee in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
      <p>However, the highest court in the US has agreed with the Maryland court of appeals’ earlier decision to reinstate Adnan’s murder conviction.</p>
      <p>Adnan’s lawyers had argued that his trial lawyer Cristina Guttierez’s failure to investigate an alibi witness – his school friend Asia McClain – violated his right to competent legal representation.</p>
      <p>It’s reported that Adnan’s name was one of 100 inmates where the court has agreed with the initial rulings.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court’s decision now sends Adnan’s team back to the drawing board after years of appeals and setbacks.</p>

      <p>Colin Miller, a legal expert from the Undisclosed podcast and a member of Adnan’s team, recently explained <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/14/is-adnan-syeds-chances-of-a-new-trial-over-legal-expert-colin-miller-explains-what-happens-next-10912483/">what would happen next should the trial appeal be rejected</a>.</p>

      <p>Speaking to <b>Metro.co.uk</b>, Colin said: ‘He has a few other options. ‘If you watch the Sky Crime series, there was DNA testing on some of the crime scene evidence. And one of them turned up a DNA profile for an identified female, so there could be additional DNA testing that might point in another direction.</p>
      <p>‘However, there’s another procedure he can use now if the Supreme Court rules against him to get that back in court and Maryland’s to get the court to consider the substance of his cell tower pain claims. So there’s a few different options he has if the Supreme Court decides not to hear his case.’</p>
      <p>Colin added that one of the options would be to get Jay Wilds to recant his star witness statement that he helped Adnan bury Hae’s body in Leakin Park.</p>
      <p>‘If this appeals to the Supreme Court doesn’t go through it’s sort of back to the drawing board to consider all options and one of those options will be trying to reach out to him and get him to recant,’ the lawyer explained.</p>

      <p>‘There are ways you can do that so it doesn’t look like you’re pressuring the witness.’</p>
