      <p>The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Monday was informed that both the wife and the sister of Manivasagam, a Maoist killed in a encounter in Kerala recently, had returned to Tiruchi Central Prison. They had been granted special leave to attend his funeral.</p>
      <p>The slain Maoistâ€™s wife Kala and sister Chandra were lodged at Tiruchi Central Prison.</p>
