      <p>A Jersey resident will write to Sir Antony next week to discuss the vision for the Island to have its own iconic sculpture.</p>
      <p>The invitation follows responses received by the JEP to the suggestion that the Island should have its own Angel of the South, inspired by Sir Antony’s celebrated image that dominates the landscape south of Gateshead, reinforcing Jersey’s position as the southernmost point in the British Isles. The resident had offered £1m to fund the project.</p>
      <p>Monitoring letters and emails sent to the JEP, the potential donor, who wishes to remain anonymous, said that he concluded that they constituted an ‘amber light’ to the proposal. He acknowledged that a significant number had serious reservations about a sculpture on the rocks near Green Island – a site suggested because of its southerly location – but he said that the positive interest made it worth trying to progress the idea taking account also of other potential sites.</p>
      <p>‘There is a wish afloat to explore creating an Angel of the South but there would have to be interest from the artist. We only have a picture of the Angel of the North at the moment but I am minded to approach him to ask whether he would be interested and what he thought of the project’, he said.</p>
      <p>A number of readers wrote letters to the JEP to express views about the proposed sculpture, several suggesting alternative locations including L’Etacq and La Collette.</p>
      <p>Among the positive responses, Jools Holt suggested that the scope of a potential project could be broadened to engage with the wider community. ‘A collaborative project – maybe helped by school children who could create a theme for Sir Antony to work on – would be a great way of inspiring our young people to take part in the creation of important new art. I hope the project gets the thumbs up,’ she said.</p>
      <p>Andy Dingle also welcomed the idea and suggested that a piece of public art by Ray Lonsdale on the North Shields fish quay could provide inspiration.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘The sculpture Fiddlers Green Fishermen’s Memorial is a tribute to fishermen and to those lost at sea and is a remarkable piece of work. We’ve always had a strong relationship with the sea, especially as Islanders, and something of this nature/structure could be very fitting.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Jersey artist Ian Rolls wrote to say that he had previously been approached to propose a potential project at La Collette and had acquired four metal girders from the demolished Portelet Hotel.</p>
      <p>‘My design, which would be ten-metres high and use recycled materials including the girders and offcuts of copper pipe to give a wind-generated pan-pipe sound element to the piece, was an interpretation of Antony Gormley’s Angel of the North, to be called Angel of the South’, Mr Rolls wrote.</p>
      <p>Responding to public feedback, the potential benefactor told the JEP that he was very grateful for the views received and that he would welcome further suggestions, whether of potential sites or of other works which might provide further inspiration for the project.</p>
