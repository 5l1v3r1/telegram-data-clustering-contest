      <h1>Things to do this Christmas 2019: the best family events and festive days out across the UK</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:25:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/lela-london/" target="_blank">Lela London</a></address>
      <p>Few families take the same approach to the holiday season, For some, Christmas is all about the day itself – the gifts, the feast, the mid-afternoon nap in front of It’s A Wonderful Life.</p>
      <p>For others, it starts weeks beforehand with cracking Christmas excursions.</p>
      <p>Long gone are the days when ramshackled ‘Winter Wonderlands’, promising some semblance of festive fun. The nation has upped the ante.</p>
      <p>Rather than hordes of sorry-looking reindeer and crying children, families are now spoilt for choice; they can dine in igloos next to the Thames, see a star-studded pantomime in their local town, and even spend a fully immersive day with Santa in Lapland.</p>
      <p>Not sure where to start? Not to worry. Take comfort – and joy – in our list of the best family events and festive days out across the UK this year. All of which are unashamedly Christmassy.</p>
      <p>('Tis the season to be jaunting, or so they say.)</p>
      <h4>The best things to do this Christmas 2019</h4>
      <h3>Haddon Hall, Derbyshire</h3>
      <p>Stately homes are a fail-safe destination for days out with the family, and Bakewell’s Haddon Hall is among the best. Largely considered the most perfect English house to survive the Middle Ages, its stunning rooms and courtyards are dressed to festive perfection over the Christmas period. Christmas choirs perform twice a day and candlelit tours are offered in the evening, including mulled wine (for adults) and mince pies (for all).</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Christmas markets have become a treasured tradition in towns all over the UK, with those in Bath, London, and Brighton praised for offering families endless festive fun. Then, there’s Birmingham’s  — the largest authentic German Christmas market this side of the Tunnel, with more food, drink and giftable goods than you could shake a schnitzel at. Frankfurt Christmas Market is well worth a day out with the family.</p>

      <p>If your family needs a break from the crush of Oxford Circus Christmas shoppers, this hidden après ski bar is perfect for just that. ‘LAAX Baby!’, a collaboration between Mews of Mayfair and Swiss ski resort LAAX, has done everything it can to bring the slopes to the city; sumptuous ski lodge aesthetics, indulgent Le Gruyere AOP, Schlossberger and Reblochon fondues, and a wide range of alpine cocktails (or mocktails, for the little ones). </p>

Inside, you can cozy up with blankets and hot water bottles, enjoy a bit of Christmas crooning, indulge in a few stone-baked pizzas, and live like chalet owners. Fancy dress box upgrade recommended. </p>

      <p>This is a 24-karat Christmas day out. An experience so well-executed that you couldn’t call it anything less than ‘magical’. After your child receives their personalised invite from Father Christmas, they are welcomed into an immersive Winter Wonderland; a day filled with toy making, cookie decorating, ice skating, ‘snow’ playing and – of course  – meeting Santa. All of which is included in the (uber-premium) price. </p>

      <h3>Stockeld Park, North Yorkshire</h3>
      <p>Stockeld Park is a one-stop shop for festive fun in Wetherby. You can buy your Christmas tree from a selection of the estate’s finest, watch Santa and his reindeer arrive in the park by sleigh, and even visit the man himself in his autism-friendly Grotto. If you have the time, it’s worth sticking around for the park’s Winter Illuminations after dusk. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>East London hasn’t always been known for its igloos, but one restaurant is doing everything it can to change that. Coppa Club’s Thame-side ‘igloos’ are woodland-themed this year – a wonderland of evergreen trees, rustic candles, recycled wool blankets, cruelty-free sheepskin rugs, and breath-taking views over Tower Bridge. Reservations and cancellations are snapped up in a flash but a limited number of walk-ins are welcome every day, and the kid’s menu (three courses &amp; a drink for only £6.95) is sensational.</p>

      <p>Manchester has a lot to offer throughout the festive season. In Cathedral Gardens alone, there are four holiday hotspots; an Ice Tiki Bar (over 18s only), Santa's Grotto, ice skating and – best of all – an Ice Cavern filled with over 100 interactive ice sculptures. In years past we’ve been titillated by all-ice polar bears, yetis, and even a frozen Rovers Return sign, but this year promises an all-ice unicorn and a cold-carved regal carriage (which, yes, you can sit in). Don’t miss out. </p>

      <h3>A celeb-cast Christmas pantomime, Nationwide</h3>
      <p>There are a rather ridiculous number of C-list celebrities popping up in pantomime this year. You can book to see Lesley Joseph in Birmingham, Craig Revel Horwood in Manchester, and the inimitable Su Pollard in Wolverhampton. But, invariably, the best of the best will be the star-studded cast of Paul O’Grady, Julian Clary and Nigel Havers in The London Palladium’s ‘Goldilocks’.</p>

This year’s interactive and family-friendly journeys are all-singing and all-dancing, led by the train’s storytelling Elves and Conductor. You can purchase festive food before setting off for Christmas Town, but you will want to save a little room for chocolate chip cookies and hot chocolate on board. </p>

      <p>The Christmas Light Trail at Kew Gardens has made a name for itself over the last few years, creating a twinkling escape from the hustle and bustle of central London. This year, they’ve kicked things up a notch; a waterfall of lights cascading an 18m-high Treetop Walkway, laser projections, smoking white haze arches, a walkway of glittering pink cherry trees, and a host of independent dinnertime delicacies from street food pioneers KERB.</p>

      <p>Though there is certainly a time and place for reciting every line from Home Alone at your TV, Neighbourhood Cinema do Christmastime cinematics better than anyone. Their 'Ice Palace' palace, hidden deep within a 100-year-old church in Buckinghamshire, lets guests watch some of the very best holiday films (from Miracle on 24th Street to Love Actually) whilst snuggled up under snow-capped trees. Popcorn, mince pies and mulled wine available. And necessary. </p>
