      <p>Robbie Balenger never intended to run across the country when he first laced up his shoes six years ago. Back then, he was simply looking for stress relief from his hectic career in the restaurant business.</p>
      <p>But in May, he crossed a finish line in Central Park, marking the end of a 3,275-mile journey from coast to coast. That’s an average of 45 miles, or more than a marathon and a half, every day, for 75 days in a row.</p>
      <p>And, he did it all on a diet of entirely plant-based meals, he told fellow plant-powered ultramarathoner Rich Roll in a <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/a27656146/robbie-balenger-vegan-cross-country-run/">recent podcast interview</a>.</p>

      <p>Balenger isn’t the first to tackle impressive mileage without eating animal products. Vegan ultra runner <a href="https://www.insider.com/broke-the-record-for-run-on-the-appalachian-trail-2018-7">Scott Jurek</a> has broken multiple records, including the fastest time to complete the 2,189-mile Appalachian trail.</p>
      <p>Balenger said he hoped to continue raising awareness of the benefits of going plant-based, even for <a href="https://www.insider.com/why-processed-foods-are-bad-digested-quickly-ultramarthon-runners-2019-8">elite endurance athletes</a>.</p>
      <p>“My motivation was from an advocacy standpoint to promote a plant-based lifestyle, and to really show what is possible on a plant-based diet,” Balenger told <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/a27656146/robbie-balenger-vegan-cross-country-run/">Runner’s World</a>.</p>

      <h3>Balenger ate an average of 8,000 calories a day, including coconut milk, bananas, peanut butter, and cold pasta</h3>
      <p>Balenger stopped every five miles to refuel on <a href="https://www.insider.com/harvard-nutrition-expert-suggests-a-high-fat-high-carb-breakfast-2019-8">high-fat, high-carb meals</a> and snacks. In all, he said he had to eat a whopping 8,000 calories each day just to sustain his body through the serious strain of daily ultramarathons. For comparison, most people require between 2,000 to 3,000 calories a day to meet their energy needs.</p>
      <p>In the mornings before he began running, Balenger said his breakfast was typically oatmeal loaded with chia seeds, bananas, maple syrup, nuts, and sometimes chocolate, along with a cup of coffee.</p>
      <p>Four times a day, he consumed 1,000-calorie smoothies made of Soylent meal replacement powder, with added coconut milk, chia seeds, bananas, and veggies. He avoided drinking plain water, instead hydrating with electrolyte powder that also added additional calories.</p>
      <p>“When you’re doing something like this, you need to get those calories whenever you can and wherever you can,” he told Roll.</p>

      <p>For meals, Balenger said he stuck to easy-to-digest carbs like cold pasta tossed in olive oil, potatoes, and quesadillas with vegan cheese. Initially, his favorite meal was a vegan banh mi sandwich, but Balenger said bread quickly got soggy and was hard to manage.</p>
      <p>“Bread was not working for me,” he said on the podcast.</p>
      <p>Balenger told Runner’s World he supplemented with energy gels and ended the day with double serving of a vegan camping meal, or pre-made, dehydrated food designed for backpackers, and a <a href="https://www.insider.com/drinking-health-benefits-heart-nutrition-2019-10">cold IPA</a>.</p>
      <p>Balenger also had dessert at the ready. Non-dairy ice cream company NadaMoo sponsored his trek, as did the nonprofit Switch4Good, which encourages people to give up dairy and adopt a plant-based diet.</p>
