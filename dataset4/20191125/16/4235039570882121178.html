      <p><b>Uber</b> shares are down nearly 5% on US OTC trading after the company's shared-travel app was stripped of its <b>London</b> <b>license</b>, BNR reported.</p>
      <p>The company lost its <b>license</b> to operate in the UK capital on Monday as the <b>London</b> Transport Regulator revealed that more than 14,000 uninsured trips had been made.</p>
      <p>Some of these journeys were undertaken by unlicensed drivers, including one person whose licence had been previously revoked by TfL, while another failure allowed "dismissed or suspended drivers to create an <b>Uber</b> account and carry passengers", Inews UK reported.</p>
      <p><b>London</b>'s transport regulators say it has decided not to renew <b>Uber</b>'s <b>license</b> for the British capital because of "a number of breaches that put passengers and their safety at risk". The transport regulator added that the shared travel company did not meet the necessary licensing requirements.</p>
      <p><b>London</b> is Europe's largest market for <b>Uber</b>, and <b>Uber</b> <b>London</b> Ltd. is likely to appeal the decision and continue to act during litigation.</p>
      <p>In September 2017, the <b>London</b> Transport Regulator announced that it would not grant <b>Uber</b> a five-year <b>London</b> work permit, but then a British court granted a 15-month <b>license</b> extension to the company.</p>
      <p><b>Uber</b>Â now has 21 days to appeal the decision, during which time it will be able to continue its activities, as well as during a possible appeal process. The company may attempt to make changes to show magistrates that it is capable and appropriate to perform its business at the time of appeal.</p>
