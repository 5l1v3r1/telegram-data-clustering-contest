      <p>Salcomp will revive the unit, which was closed for nearly 10 years, and the facility will become operational from March 2020.</p>
      <p>This unit will produce chargers and other equipment and will boast of a diversified portfolio. This will entail an investment of Rs 2,000 crore in five years.</p>
      <p>Once fully functional, the new unit is expected to generate employment for close to 10,000 people. Salcomp currently operates two units in the same special economic one in Sriperumbudur, where it employs close to 7,000 people.</p>
      <p>The Minister added that 70 per cent of products from this SEZ facility will be exported including to China. It will lead to a lot of value addition.</p>
