      <p>A man in Europe is on the run after making a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/kim-kardashian-microwave-mms">sweet</a> getaway.</p>
      <p>Austrian police are searching for a suspect who drove off with a truck full of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/snack-foods">chocolate</a> after impersonating the delivery driver who was supposed to transport the candy to Belgium.</p>

      <p>The factory that makes the Milka products had reportedly hired a local company to drive the chocolate from Austria to Belgium. According to the police, the company contracted a Czech driver for the delivery — which is why no suspicion was raised when a Czech driver showed up, <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/austrian-thief-steals-20-tons-of-chocolate/a-51358297">DW</a> reports.</p>
