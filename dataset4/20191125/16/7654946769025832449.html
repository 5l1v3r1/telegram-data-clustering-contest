      <p>Five farm animals were recently stabbed to death and spray-painted with pentagrams in southern England — and locals fear a satanic-style cult may be to blame, according to a new report.</p>
      <p>Two sheep and three cattle were knifed and sprayed with the occult symbol in and around Hampshire’s New Forest National Park within five days, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/sheep-cattle-stabbed-death-sprayed-satanic-symbols-11210327/">Metro UK reported Sunday</a>.</p>
      <p>Another cow was also injured, and someone scrawled the number “666” on the partly 12th-ventury St. Peter’s Church in Bramshaw, the Rev. David Bacon, who presides there, told the outlet.</p>
      <p>“It could just be kids, but I don’t think it is, given the context,” Bacon told Metro. “There’s been witchcraft round here for hundreds of years — the New Forest is well known for witchcraft and black magic happening, and this has obviously gone up a level.”</p>
      <p>Resident Judy Rudd discovered one of the slaughtered sheep while walking her two dogs through the village, about 80 miles southwest of London she told the outlet.</p>
      <p>“It had purple and green aerosol symbols sprayed on it,” Rudd said. “It was a pentagram and a cross. It had been stabbed to death. The wounds were in the side of the body by the rib cage. It was very unpleasant. Some people think it’s sinister.”</p>
      <p>Her husband, Julian, told the outlet it’s “reasonable” to suggest the animals weren’t killed by “lads messing about.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t agree that it’s done to shock — you don’t go around knifing animals simply to shock people,” he told the outlet. “It’s related to something other than simply a desire to injure animals. It’s either witchcraft or whatever. It’s rather worrying.”</p>
      <p>Police are investigating the “unusual” incidents, according to the report.</p>
