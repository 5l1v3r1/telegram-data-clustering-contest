      <h1>Tile Announces New Smart Alerts Feature Ahead of Apple 'AirTags'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:18:08+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:18</time> by <a rel="author">iClarified</a></address>
      <p>Tile has announced a new Smart Alerts feature that will launch in beta ahead of Apple's rumored <a href="https://www.iclarified.com/72241/leaked-internal-build-of-ios-13-reveals-new-details-about-apples-tile-competitor-images">AirTag tracker</a>, reports Engadget.<br/><br/>Smart Alerts will automatically warn users when they've left a tracked item behind if it's been there for at least five minutes. For example, if you left your bag behind at a coffee shop, you'll hopefully be alerted before it's gone. The feature will require a Premium subscription which costs $3/month or $30/year. <br/><br/>You'll be able to define 'safe zones' for items to set whether or not you'll get an alert. This will prevent notifications when you've intentionally left a tracked item behind, for example, at your home.<br/><br/>Smart Alerts will launch in beta next month. Tile offers a wide <a href="https://www.iclarified.com/72780/tile-launches-new-trackers-tile-sticker-tile-slim-tile-pro-tile-mate">range of smart trackers</a> including the <a href="https://amzn.to/2XHBBCW">Tile Mate</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/37AvMLT">Tile Stickers</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ok4IJk">Tile Slim</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2QLfwlv">Tile Pro</a>, and more.<br/><br/>Please <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/iclarified/id388040325">download the iClarified app</a> or follow iClarified on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/iclarified"><b>Twitter</b></a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/iclarified"><b>Facebook</b></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/iclarified"><b>YouTube</b></a>, and <a href="https://www.iclarified.com/rss/rss.xml"><b>RSS</b></a> for updates.<br/><br/>[<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/25/tile-tracker-smart-alerts-anywhere/">via Engadget</a>]</p>
