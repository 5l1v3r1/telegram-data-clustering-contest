      <p>I can’t make an investment case for a company whose losses grow as it scales. That’s why I said no to <b>Uber</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/uber-stock-quote/"><b><u>UBER</u></b></a>) and <b>Lyft</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/lyft-stock-quote/"><b><u>LYFT</u></b></a>). It’s why <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/08/wework-stock-ipo-numbers-dont-work/">I laughed at WeWork</a>. It’s also why I’ve never put money into <b>Tesla</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/tsla-stock-quote/"><b><u>TSLA</u></b></a>).</p>

      <p>Tesla has yet to make a full year of profit, even as revenue has grown six-fold since 2015. The market capitalization, once again ahead of <b>General Motors</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/gm-stock-quote/"><b><u>GM</u></b></a>), has no relation to its industry.</p>
      <p>You can speculate on Tesla. If you called your bookie and took a flyer in May, when it was at $185 per share, you’re golden today at $345. But you would have done just as well going short last November, when it was at $350, then covering the bet in May.</p>
      <p>But is this time different? Is it time to invest in Tesla?</p>
      <h3>The Bull Case</h3>
      <p>The key to the bull case is Tesla’s third-quarter report, with net income of $143 million, or 78 cents per share fully diluted, <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/47313d21-3cac-4f69-9497-d161bce15da4">on revenue of $6.3 billion</a>. Since that report came out Oct. 23, the shares are up by nearly one-third. <i>Consumer Reports</i> has put its <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/tech/tesla-consumer-reports/index.html">“recommended” rating back</a> on Tesla cars.</p>
      <p>Whatever you think of its “unbreakable” windows <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/22/cars/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-truck/index.html">breaking</a> during a demonstration, the launch of Tesla’s “Cybertruck” was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacknerad2/2019/11/24/tesla-rules-5-key-takeaways-from-los-angeles-auto-show-week/#39732a573993">a master class in marketing</a>. CEO Elon Musk, previously punished for tweeting about a takeover that didn’t happen, said <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198788116372344832">200,000</a> orders have already been placed.</p>
      <p>The truck isn’t the company’s only new product. A Model Y, a low-cost SUV, will start rolling off assembly lines <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/26/business/tesla-model-y-elon-musk/index.html">next year</a>, replacing the luxury-priced Model X. SUVs are rapidly taking share from sedans in the U.S. market.</p>
      <p>So, maybe Tesla’s solar roof <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/gvdksayj">can work</a>. Maybe the Model Y can do even better than the Model 3. Maybe the Shanghai factory, now <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/tech/tesla-china-model-3-factory/index.html">delivering cars</a> to the Chinese market, may soon be joined by a factory <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/13/business/tesla-berlin-gigafactory/index.html">in Berlin</a>. Maybe the truck’s window cracked because the door had just been hit by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20981489/tesla-cybertruck-glass-window-fail-elon-musk-explanation">a sledgehammer</a>. Maybe the stock is headed back <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/teslas-cybertruck-could-send-stock-toward-all-time-highs-options-traders-say.html">over its all-time highs</a>.</p>
      <h3>The Bear Case</h3>
      <p>Notice all the maybes in the bullish case?</p>
      <p>So do the bears.</p>
      <p>Credit Suisse expects <b>Ford</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/f-stock-quote/"><b><u>F</u></b></a>) to provide serious competition in electric vehicles next year, and predicts Tesla shares <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/14/tesla-skeptic-model-3-window-of-opportunity-but-ford-ev-coming-soon.html">will fall 40%</a>. That would bring them back to the level of late-May.</p>
      <p>Jim Cramer thinks the Cybertruck is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/11/22/jim-cramer-teslas-cybertruck-looks-like-a-bit-of-a-bust.html">a bust</a>, despite Musk’s explanation that its flat, planar design is the result of using steel that <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/11/24/teslas-cybertruck-looks-weird-because-otherwise-it-would-break-the-machines-to-make-it/">can’t be bent</a>.</p>
      <p>Short-seller Jim Chanos also remains <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jim-chanos-on-tesla-we-are-still-bears-2019-11-21">a Tesla bear</a>, saying there are too many “ifs” in the bullish case.</p>
      <p>Service, repair and re-sale revenue <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/31/tesla-services-and-other-q3-2019.html">grew 68% during that third quarter</a> but U.S. sales were down. How can you buy a stock whose sales are dropping?</p>
      <h3>The Bottom Line on Tesla Stock</h3>
      <p>Tesla has always been a young man’s company and remains so.</p>
      <p>You can make money in Tesla. But you’re entirely dependent on capital gains. You’re always riding momentum.</p>
      <p>Right now, that momentum seems headed higher, but it could turn on a dime. At a market cap of $60 billion, you’re back to paying 2.5 times sales in an industry where even profitable companies draw one-tenth of that valuation.</p>
      <p>As much as speculators love Tesla today, they could hate it that much tomorrow. <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/379678/video-tesla-hate-exposed-explored/">Many people still hate Tesla</a>, seeing it as an exemplar of upper-class values, big brotherism and environmentalist extremism.</p>
      <p>I root for Elon Musk and I root for Tesla, too. But the only way to play it remains to sell it high and buy it low. Right now, it’s high.</p>
