      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:05:11+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:05</time> by <a rel="author">Marjorie Kerr, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/marjorie-kerr/</a></address>
      <p>Over £45 million has been invested in good causes in West Lothian thanks to the National Lottery.</p>
      <p>The figures were released as the Lotto celebrated its 25th anniversary.</p>
      <p>Since the first draw on November 19, 1994, over 1100 good causes in West Lothian have benefited from funding, across the community, arts, sport and heritage sectors.</p>
      <p>A wide variety of local projects have received National Lottery funding over the last quarter century.</p>
      <p>In and around West Lothian these include, the largest ever National Lottery grant in West Lothian of £2.1 million awarded in June 2003 to the Cockburn Conservation Trust for Blackburn House and the first ever National Lottery grant of £218,000 awarded to the Nasmyth Bridge in Almondell Country Park in June 1995.</p>
      <p>Most National Lottery grants, however, are for £10,000 or less and recent awards include, £9625 to Carers Of West Lothian to pilot a variety of support activities for adults with disabilities, including mindfulness sessions, counselling, and drop-in social gatherings; £10,000 to West Lothian Pride Association to hold their annual pride event and £9460 to West Lothian 50+ Network provide activities and build a community for over 50s across West Lothian to prevent social isolation.</p>
      <p>Maureen McGinn, chair of The National Lottery Community Fund Scotland and spokesperson for The National Lottery in Scotland said: “When the National Lottery launched in 1994, no one could have anticipated the phenomenal impact it was set to have on good causes across Scotland and beyond.</p>
      <p>“Over the last 25 years, more than £3 billion of National Lottery players money has been invested in more than 64,000 local people and projects across the country.</p>
      <p>“Without the funding, many of our most loved and iconic landmarks wouldn’t exist and many charities wouldn’t be changing lives to the degree they are now.</p>
      <p>“We would like to say a huge thank you to everyone who has played The National Lottery over the last 25 years. You have truly made extraordinary things happen.”</p>
