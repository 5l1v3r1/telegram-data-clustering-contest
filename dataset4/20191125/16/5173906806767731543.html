        <b>The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), on Monday ratified the celebration of the World Day of Portuguese Language on May 5, making official the proposal presented by Portuguese-speaking countries in 2009.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the proposal approved today, it can be read that "Portuguese is the language of nine UNESCO member states, is the official language in three continental organizations and the General Conference of UNESCO and is spoken by over 265 million people, being one of the most spoken in the northern hemisphere.</p>
      <p>In the argument for the ratification of the proposal, UNESCO writes that "it is necessary to implement comprehensive cooperation among peoples through multilateralism, cultural rapprochement and dialogue between civilizations, in line with the UNESCO Constitution".</p>
      <p>The note concludes, "UNESCO decides to proclaim the 5th of May each year with the World Day of Portuguese Language" and encourages "the member states, especially in the CPLP, and other stakeholders, to participate in the event in a way that each considers appropriate and without financial implications for the regular budget of UNESCO.</p>
