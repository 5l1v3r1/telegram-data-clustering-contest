      <h1>Stormzy backs Labour and says 'change is possible under a Corbyn government'</h1>
      <h2>The Croydon-born Grime star urged people to register to vote before tomorrow's deadline. Stormzy also said 'people led change can be possible under a Jeremy Corbyn Labour government'.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:03:04+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:03</time> by <a rel="author">Elaine McCahill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/elaine-mccahill/</a></address>
      <p>Stormzy has backed Labour and Jeremy Corbyn in the upcoming <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> as he urged people to register to vote before tomorrow's deadline.</p>
      <p>The Grime star asked voters to throw their support behind the party in order to bring about "people-led change" and bring an end to austerity.</p>
      <p>In a letter to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/stormzy-backs-labour-in-election-with-call-to-end-austerity">Guardian,</a> Stormzy along with Akala, Professor Green, Kano, Lowkey, Saskilla, Sharkey Major and Charlie Sloth, all said they would be supporting Labour on December 12.</p>
      <p>The letter reads: “Ending austerity will, for the first time in many of our lifetimes, use the taxes we all already pay into, to reinvest in the housing, youth clubs, community groups and cultural centres being destroyed by the current government.</p>
      <p>“We are under no illusions about Labour’s own imperial history, and we don’t think the British establishment is fundamentally going to change. But we are sick of our taxes being spent on fighting more wars and building more jails.</p>

      <p>“Jeremy Corbyn has been one of the few people who has fought against injustice all his political life, from apartheid South Africa to the bombing of Libya.”</p>
      <p>Tomorrow at 23:59 is the deadline for people to register to vote and a record 2.8million have registered since the election was called.</p>
      <p>The letter adds: “The opportunity for people-led change can be made possible under a Jeremy Corbyn Labour government. End austerity, rebuild our communities and take back the means to change our lives for the better.</p>
      <p>“Surely, in an election that could transform the livelihoods of many, and be the difference between life or death for many more, life is something worth voting for.”</p>
      <p>Stormzy is a known Labour supporter and famously performed the lyric "f**k Boris" during his set at Glastonbury this year.</p>
      <p>His set, which was broadcast live and uncensored on BBC Two, included track Cold, which features the line: "So tell   <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a>  , ‘Suck your mum!’”</p>
      <p>And on Vossi Bop, he raps “F*** the government and f*** Boris" before criticising the failure to get a   <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a>   deal and keep campaign promises.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn tweeted at the time: "Tonight @Stormzy made history by being the first black solo British headliner at Glastonbury.</p>
      <p>"The performance was political, iconic and the ballet was beautifully powerful. It won't just go down in Glastonbury history - it'll go down in our country's cultural history. #Glasto2019."</p>

      <p>Last night Lily Allen, Emeli Sandé, the actor Mark Rylance joined a host of celebrities to help <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> launch <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> ’s £1bn charter for the arts.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn has pledged a “cultural renaissance” that would put the arts at the “heart of government”.</p>
      <p>Labour said their ‘Arts for All’ charter aims to give all of Britain access to culture.</p>
      <p>It includes £1billion for building and upgrading libraries, museums and art galleries and £175 million a year in an arts pupil premium to give every primary school student in the country access the arts.</p>
      <p>Research by the House of Commons Library has shown that libraries, museums and art galleries across England have had their funding slashed by at least £640m since 2010.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn said: "The Government I lead will ensure that every child has the opportunity to access the arts, learn a musical instrument and develop their creativity."</p>
