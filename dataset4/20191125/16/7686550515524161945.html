      <h1>Carmarthen 'will be left behind' without new business improvement scheme</h1>
      <h2>A ballot of hundreds of town centre traders will take place next February</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:23:57+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:23</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Youle</a></address>
      <p>Carmarthen looks set to have its own business improvement scheme after "vital" backing from the county council.</p>
      <p>Councillors approved a series of recommendations which will help pave the way for the new Carmarthen business improvement district (Bid).</p>
      <p>Bid schemes have been credited with boosting the fortunes of towns and cities through events, festivals and other actions.</p>
      <p>John Nash, who leads the Carmarthen Bid steering group, said the council's support was crucial.</p>
      <p>"It's vital, without a doubt," he said.</p>
      <p>The scheme would raise just over £160,000 per year by levying a charge on members and run for an initial period of five years, subject to confirmation via a postal ballot.</p>
      <p>The council backed the proposal at a meeting on November 13, and will nominate a representative to sit on the Bid company board.</p>
      <p>The authority also agreed to collect the Bid levy at no charge for five years, and contribute its share relating to 15 council-owned properties within the Bid zone.</p>
      <p>Council leader Emlyn Dole said. "It is something we would like to support fully."</p>
      <p>Carmarthen Town South Cllr Alun Lenny said the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/carmarthen">town</a> was doing well but that small businesses were suffering from the growth in internet shopping.</p>
      <p>"Local businesses need every help they can get," he said.</p>
      <p>Cllr John Jenkins said Bid schemes were a good way of getting traders and councils together.</p>
      <p>He said the work of Ymlaen Llanelli - the Bid scheme in his local town - had increased footfall significantly.</p>
      <p>"It's a fantastic way of putting a town centre on the map," he said.</p>
      <p>The Carmarthen Bid's priorities are improving business profitability, improving parking for businesses and customers, and improving the profile and look of the town.</p>
      <p>Member businesses would pay an annual levy equivalent to 1.5 per cent of their rateable value if it's over £6,000. For a business with a £50,000 rateable value, it would work out at £750 per year.</p>
      <p>A five-year plan sets out how the money raised would be spent, although the Bid board would also seek external sources of funding.</p>
      <p>One pledge is to fund a town centre ambassador as part of a "croeso cynnes" (warm welcome) initiative, while a loyalty card scheme for shoppers and staff could also be explored.</p>
      <p>Mr Nash said a ballot of more than 300 traders and premises would take place in February, prior to a board of directors being appointed.</p>
      <p>A previous study, he said, showed that 74 per cent of traders were in favour of the Bid scheme.</p>
      <p>"Carmarthen will be left behind if we don't go down the Bid route," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Nash also said the steering group needed four more volunteers.</p>
      <p>"It could be an estate agent, or solicitor - and we would like someone from the transport sector," he said.</p>
