      <p>If your prospects define you, what do <a href="https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Jeremy_Corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a>’s say about him? Faced with a Conservative administration that has overseen an era of austerity, that is deepening divisions over Brexit, led by a man voters do not trust and touting policies that are simultaneously hardline and complacent, the Labour leader’s best-case election scenario is reducing that government to the largest party in a hung parliament.</p>
      <p>Current polls do not even offer that crumb of hope for Mr Corbyn. At present, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1845e4e6-0eaf-11ea-a225-db2f231cfeae">Boris Johnson</a>, the prime minister, is on course for victory. The story of the next two weeks will be whether Labour can close the gap enough to deny him a majority. Elections are live events and Labour may well manage to squeeze the Liberal Democrat vote enough that, aided by tactical voting, a hung parliament becomes viable. But it is being chased out of Scotland, pushed back in Wales and run hard in its traditional heartlands in the north of England. It remains true that potential political pacts mean Mr Corbyn can secure office even if he loses ground. But against this most undeserving government, it is surely telling that no one outside his most fanatical allies imagines an outright Labour victory.</p>
      <p>This election should be there for Labour’s taking. Is there a dispassionate observer who does not think that Tony Blair would have taken the Tories apart? Instead, a self-indulgent and ideologically obsessed clique is holding open the door of Number 10 for Mr Johnson. It is a shocking abandonment of those very voters who most need a change.</p>
      <p>Against a government which does not deserve to win, all you need is an opposition which does not deserve to lose. That Labour fails that test is the fault of Mr Corbyn and his hard-left acolytes.</p>
      <p>Faced with the prospect of a hard Tory Brexit, Mr Corbyn has managed to construct a prospectus that looks even more economically ruinous; a manifesto that effectively tells outside investors the UK is closed for business.</p>
      <p>There are many individual Labour policies that will be popular and much is to be said for its diagnosis of the economy’s ills — be they overmighty employers, monopolistic utilities, rentier capitalism or a lack of investment. Yet rather than choosing a few major reforms — decarbonising the economy, renationalising rail, improving the National Health Service or building homes — Labour has opted not to make any choices.</p>
      <p>All spending ideas are approved, all options for renationalisation will happen in one term. On Sunday, just four days after committing to nearly £83bn a year in new taxes, mostly raised on business and investment, the party came up with another £58bn pledge that had not made the manifesto. This is less a set of strategic choices than a shopaholic out with someone else’s Amex.</p>
      <p>There is no doubt the political centre-ground has moved on spending and services. But Mr Corbyn has gone way beyond what is achievable in a single term because of an ideological focus on re-engineering the entire market economy. Successful business people are overtly depicted as the enemy. Numerous <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/067c164a-0c43-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67">tax rises</a> are planned. Some, like the treatment of capital gains as income, are defensible. Yet the cumulative effect is an all-out attack on wealth creators which will deter foreign investment.</p>
      <p>The ideological approach goes beyond the economy. Why, for example, would a party which wants to improve state schools scrap the standards watchdog Ofsted and abolish academy schools?</p>
      <p>Then there is foreign policy. Electing Mr Corbyn would be handing control of Britain’s defences to people who think the wrong side won the cold war. Patriotic working-class voters do not see Mr Corbyn as the man to stand up for Britain. And this is before we even get to the issues around anti-Semitism.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn’s chance was to assemble a Remain coalition behind a progressive left manifesto, albeit with a rather ambivalent position on the EU. Instead, voters are confronted by a man who seems as big a threat as Brexit.</p>
      <p>It may yet be that his potpourri of policies can win enough support among the young, the environmentally concerned and those who have suffered under austerity to stop Mr Johnson. There is no doubt Mr Corbyn has mobilised an activist base as no other recent leader has managed, while the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2b82b520-0eaf-11ea-a225-db2f231cfeae">Tory safety first campaign</a> could yet be seen as too complacent. But time is running out.</p>
      <p>If Labour loses it will be because the leadership was too ideologically inflexible to compromise with voters. For all those yearning for more investment in public services, a fairer economy, a saner Brexit and those just desperate to be rid of a government which has deepened the divides in the nation, Labour’s approach is a shameful betrayal.</p>
