      <ul>
        <li>Playground Games is working on a role-playing game, possibly Fable IV.</li>
        <li>The studio is hiring a lot of new developers for the project.</li>
        <li>Today, it announced that Brian Merrill and Martin Bunker joined from Ready At Dawn and Rockstar North, respectively.</li>
        <li>The upcoming game will be available through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Xbox+Game+Pass+Ultimate&amp;qid=1563752029&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU72146YYw">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</li>

      <p>For many months, rumors have been floating around that Playground Games — the makers of the Forza Horizon series — are working on <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/fable-4-gameplay-release-date">Fable IV</a>. While we don't know if that's actually the case, we do know that the team is working on a role-playing game and it's hiring a lot of amazing developers to help it create this next-generation experience.</p>
      <p>Today, the studio announced that Brian Merrill was now at Playground Games as the Lead VFX Artist. He previously worked at Ready At Dawn that is known for The Order: 1886. Apart from that, Martin Bunker joined the team as Principal Animation Engineer from Rockstar North. Rockstar is of course known for classics like Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption. You can take a look at the statement below.</p>
