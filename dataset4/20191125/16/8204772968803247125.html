      <h1>Bookmakers on duty at Punchestown but may not take bets on every race</h1>
      <h2>Donnacha O’Brien outlines training plans after announcing retirement from saddle</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:30:50+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/brian-o-connor-7.1837479" target="_blank">Brian O'Connor</a></address>
      <p>Bookmakers have rowed back on the threat of ‘strike’ action at Punchestown’s fixture on Tuesday although they may not bet on every one of the seven races.</p>
      <p>On Sunday the Irish National Professional Bookmakers’ Association (INPBA) said a service couldn’t be guaranteed at upcoming race meetings due to a dispute with the racecourse’s organisation and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Horse+Racing+Ireland">Horse Racing Ireland</a> (HRI).</p>
      <p>That has arisen on the back of widespread bookmaker unhappiness about various race-planning issues as well as charges imposed on layers in relation to poorly attended midweek fixtures in particular.</p>
      <p>On Monday the INPBA chairman <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Ray+Mulvaney">Ray Mulvaney</a> said there had been positive reaction from various industry stakeholders to their weekend statement but that he hadn’t heard from either HRI or the Association of Irish Racecourses (AIR).</p>
      <p>It leaves open the prospect of Tuesday’s fixture having as much focus centred on the betting ring as the track.</p>
      <p>“There will be bookmakers in Punchestown. Whether we work all the races or not remains to be seen, regarding if AIR come back with a mediation process so we can move forward.</p>
      <p>“We want to serve the racetracks but our voice needs to hard,” said Mulvaney.</p>
      <p>The charges issue, which means bookmakers pay five times the admission price to stand in the ring, appears to be particularly contentious.</p>

      <p>The INPBA wants to negotiate that in the light of declining attendances at midweek meetings which in turn has contributed to falling bookmaker turnover.</p>
      <p>“If AIR do come back, our members will want to see what they come back with: so ‘watch this space’ for the want of a better expression,” Mulvaney added.</p>
      <p>Dual champion flat jockey Donnacha O’Brien, who announced his retirement from the saddle on Sunday, expects to have his licence to train by the New Year.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old Classic-winning rider has confirmed he will train out of the Longfield yard near Cashel that <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=David+Wachman">David Wachman</a> operated from until his own retirement.</p>
      <p>“There’s a bit of paperwork to fill out but hopefully I’ll have a licence in the next few weeks or maybe in the New Year might look more likely.</p>
      <p>“I’ve a small team of horses to look forward to and I’m looking forward to getting stuck in,” O’Brien reported.</p>
      <p>His brother Joseph gives the expensive purchase Dlauro a first start over flights at Tuesday’s Punchestown programme.</p>
      <p>Bought for £410,000 after winning a point-to-point, JP McManus’s runner won a bumper at the course in May and could be forward enough to beat a three-pronged attack from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Willie+Mullins">Willie Mullins</a>.</p>
