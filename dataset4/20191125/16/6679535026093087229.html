      <h1>Global trade cheer spurs Sensex</h1>
      <h2>Index closes at a new all-time high; Nifty crosses the 12,000 mark</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:57:08+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:57</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>A strong trend in the global markets due to renewed optimism over U.S.-China trade talks pushed the Indian benchmarks higher. The Sensex closed at a new high on Monday and the broader Nifty a tad lower than its all-time closing high seen in June.</p>
      <p>The 30-share Sensex gained 529.82 points, or 1.31%, to close at a new high of 40,889.23. Earlier in the day, it came close to the psychological mark of 41,000 to touch an intraday high of 40,931.71.</p>
      <p>The bulk of the index gains were contributed by heavyweights like HDFC, Axis Bank, Bharti Airtel, Reliance Industries, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Indusind Bank and State Bank of India, among others.</p>
      <p>The broader Nifty gained 159.35 points, or 1.34%, to close at 12,073.75 — only slightly lower than its all-time high close of 12,088.55 witnessed on June 3.</p>
      <p>Investor sentiments in India were lifted amid an overall strong trend in global markets after it emerged that the U.S. and China were nearing a solution on a key issue related to intellectual property in their overall trade negotiations. China has said it would raise penalties on violations of intellectual property rights.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in Asia, the benchmarks of Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and China all ended the day in the positive territory on Monday.</p>
      <p>“Signs of a cooling in rhetoric between U.S. and China has contributed to a resumption in foreign flows into India,” said S. Hariharan, head, sales trading, Emkay Global Financial Services.</p>

      <p>“Today’s market move is in line with similarly strong sentiment across Asian markets. A pick-up in credit disbursement led by PSU banks over the festive period, coupled with fiscal easing, has contributed to stronger consumer demand across segments,” Mr. Hariharan added.</p>
      <p>Foreign portfolio investors, who bought shares worth nearly ₹12,400 crore in October, are net buyers at more than ₹18,000 crore in the current month till date. The strong sentiment was further reflected in the overall market breadth with 1,400 stocks gaining on the BSE, as against 1,100 declines.</p>
