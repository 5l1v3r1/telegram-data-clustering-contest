      <p>Good news for those who are already starting to live, sleep and breathe <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/">Christmas</a> - you can actually now be all festive <i>while</i> you're slumbering!</p>
      <p>It may not even be December yet but these duvet sets <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/deals/">found on Wowcher</a> should bring a bit of Christmas cheer to the bedrooms of all festive fans.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wowcher.co.uk/deal/bath/12766298/dress-christmas-duvet-cover-set">This fun bedding</a> - available as 'single Boy', 'single Girl' and 'couples' - allows customers to celebrate the season all from the comfort of their own bed.</p>
      <p>The single options cost £12.99 and the couples version is priced at £16.99.</p>

      <p>But elsewhere online they can retail for nearly £50 - so this really is a Christmas present!</p>
      <p>The couples version portrays Father Christmas and Mrs Christmas holding hands as snowflakes fall against a pale grey background.</p>
      <p>The duvet illustrations do, however, lack faces and heads - and that's where napping bed residents come in as they rest on their pillows!</p>
      <p>The reversible furnishing is also 52% polyester and 48% cotton and should be washed at 40 degrees.</p>
