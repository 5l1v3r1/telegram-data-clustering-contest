      <p>Almost half of Ukrainians (43.5%), surveyed by Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation on November 4-19, believe the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament, will finalize its five-year term, while 32,9% say there will be snap elections in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>In particular, sociologists asked Ukrainians whether the newly-elected Verkhovna Rada would be working until November 2024 (full term) or whether early elections would be held in the country.</p>
      <p>Some 43.5% of respondents believe parliament will work full term, 32.9% forecast snap elections, while another 23.6% found it difficult to answer the question, according to the nationwide survey presented at a press conference on November 25.</p>
      <p>When asked whether they are satisfied with the way the parliament is currently operating, only 6.4% of Ukrainians polled said they were completely satisfied, 27.5% – mostly satisfied, 25.8% – mostly unsatisfied, 21.3% – completely unsatisfied, and another 19.1% failed to answer.</p>
      <p>Ukrainians were also asked how they feel about the formation of a single-party majority in the Verkhovna Rada.</p>
      <p>Some 22.3% of respondents completely support mono-majority since, in their opinion, this will ensure quick and effective passing of laws, while 17.4% fully support it because such a majority will be able to realize their election promises.</p>
      <p>At the same time, 22% of respondents do not support it since a single-party majority can make any decisions, including "illegal" ones. Some 18.2% also responded negatively as such a majority can lead to a neglect of democratic procedure. Another 20% found it difficult to answer the question.</p>
      <p>The survey was conducted in 110 settlements across Ukraine with the exception of Crimea and the occupied areas in Donetsk and Luhansk regions on November 4-19. A total of 2,041 respondents were interviewed. The margin of error does not exceed 2.3%.</p>
