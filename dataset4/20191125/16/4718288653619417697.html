      <p>CHENNAI: The AIADMK has amended its bylaws mandating a minimum of five years uninterrupted membership in the party to contest for all posts, including top positions of coordinator and co-coordinator.</p>
      <p>The change was made at the party's general council and executive committee meet held here on Sunday, according to party sources.</p>
      <p>The move is perceived as an attempt to foreclose the possibility of V K Sasikala, aide of late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, or her relatives from trying to assume party posts.</p>
      <p>Sasikala is now serving a prison term in a graft case in a Bengaluru jail and this move is seen as a bid to prevent her from contesting party positions after her release.</p>
      <p>Following the merger of factions led by Chief Minisiter K Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minsiter O Panneerselvam in August 2017, Sasikala was removed as interim general secretary by the general council meet held in September that year.</p>
      <p>Sasikala was appointed to the top post on December 29, 2016 after death of then party supremo J Jayalalithaa.</p>
      <p>Though her nephew TTV Dhinakaran was previously considered a challenge to the AIADMK leadership, his clout is on the wane with several of his topline leaders quitting the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam led by him.</p>
