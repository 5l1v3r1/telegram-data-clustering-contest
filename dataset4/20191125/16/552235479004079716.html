      <p>A lorry driver has died after crashing into a motorway central reservation barrier in Dumfries and Galloway.</p>
      <p>The northbound articulated lorry hit the barrier on the A74(M) south of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lockerbie">Lockerbie</a> , at Junction 20, and left the road just after 5.45am on Monday.</p>
      <p>Both carriageways were closed as emergency services recovered the vehicle, with a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/car-crashes">crash</a> scene investigation taking place.</p>
      <p>The southbound carriageway reopened around midday but the northbound carriageway remained shut.</p>
      <p>Inspector Campbell Moffat said: "We are appealing to anyone who may have been on the A74(M) motorway this morning to get in touch if they saw this crash.</p>

      <p>"We would also be keen to hear from anyone who may have captured any dashcam footage of the crash, or the northbound lorry just prior to the crash.</p>
      <p>"Anyone with any information should call police on the 101 number and quote the reference number 0454 25 November 2019."</p>
      <p>A second incident happened near the same junction at 10.05am, with a van driver in a critical condition in hospital after crashing with a lorry near Eaglesfield.</p>
