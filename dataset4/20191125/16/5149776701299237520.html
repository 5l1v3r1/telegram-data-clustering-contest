      <h1>'Too enigmatic' - Nottingham Forest legend's advice for Joao Carvalho</h1>
      <h2>Nottingham Forest news| Kenny Burns believes the Reds' club record signing will be a better player if he takes a leaf out of a teammate's book</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:05:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:05</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Davies</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham Forest have a space in their midfield after Ryan Yates was sent off on Saturday - but I wouldn't start Joao Carvalho at QPR on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>You could make a case for Tiago Silva to drop in alongside Ben Watson and play Carvalho as a number 10.</p>
      <p>Not for me at the moment. <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/joao-carvalho">Carvalho </a>hasn't shown enough to come into the side..</p>

      <p>Carvalho has tonnes of talent, he should as <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest's</a> record signing, but when he's not playing as well as he can, he needs to take a leaf out of Silva's book.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/match-reports/nottingham-forest-bristol-city-verdict-3572317">Silva isn't naturally combative </a>but he puts himself about for the team. Carvalho needs to do the same.</p>
      <p>I'm not saying fly into tackles, but close your man down for 90 minutes and make a nuisance of yourself.</p>
      <p>That way you're contributing even if you're not on form. Forest can't afford any passengers and Silva has made sure that is never the case with him.</p>
      <p>Going to QPR won't be easy on Wednesday and while Carvalho has had some good moments, like at Swansea or when he came on against Derby, he's not had any consistency to his game after getting injured in pre-season.</p>
      <p>It would be a shame if he was too enigmatic to fulfil his potential at Forest.</p>
