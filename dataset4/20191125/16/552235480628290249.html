      <h1>West Dunbartonshire SNP candidate makes case for re-election</h1>
      <h2>Martin Docherty is already in his third campaign having first taken up office in 2015.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:42:01+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:42</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Clarke, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-clarke/</a></address>
      <p>SNP candidate for West Dunbartonshire Martin Docherty has only been an MP for four years – and this is already his third election campaign.</p>
      <p>The Clydebank native became the first member of the SNP to represent the constituency at Westminster in 2015 as he took a landslide victory against Labour’s Gemma Doyle.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Martin told the Lennox Herald about his aims and priorities should he be re-elected next month</p>
      <p>He said: “My constituents voted overwhelmingly to remain and they voted for Scotland to be an independent sovereign country.</p>
      <p>“In West Dunbartonshire I’d say that the support for independence has solidified and expanded to take in a broader swath of opinion.</p>
      <p>“I’ve noticed a real upsurge in support, and from some of the unexpected people in the community following the Brexit vote.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been working with a whole range of people, including members of other parties and the government, to try and stop the utter madness of Brexit.</p>
      <p>“Without a doubt voting for a member of the Scottish National Party is voting for the right of the Scottish people to choose their destiny.”</p>
      <p>Despite Brexit and Scottish independence stealing many of the headlines it is the continued roll-out of Universal Credit that Martin has stated is one of his biggest priorities.</p>

      </p>
      <p>He continued: “One of the main things that you’re constantly reminded of as a member of parliament is the impact of the issues that Tory policies that are non-devolved have.</p>
      <p>“This includes the draconian impact of Universal Credit on the people of West Dunbartonshire.</p>
      <p>“In the past couple of weeks I have seen the impact of Universal Credit forcing people into foodbanks and into relying on, let’s be blunt, charity.</p>
      <p>“People come and meet myself and my team to talk about the way they’ve been treated by the DWP and how it holds them back. It reduces their social security whilst it shouldn’t.</p>
      <p>“If I was to be re-elected I would champion how social security needs to be fit for purpose, how it needs to be humane and how it needs to assist in the policies of government to eradicate poverty.”</p>
      <p>Also standing in the election on December 12 are Labour’s Jean Anne Mitchell, the Conservatives’ Alix Mathieson, the Liberal Democrat’s Jenni Lang, the Scottish Green’s Peter Connolly and independent Andrew Muir.</p>
      <p>Jenni Lang will stand for the Lib Dems, who finished a distant fourth place in 2017 with just 2.3 percent of the vote, whilst Peter Connolly will become the Greens first ever parliamentary candidate in West Dunbartonshire.</p>
      <p>Also standing is independent candidate Andrew Muir whose wife, Claire, stood in the 2015 election – also as an independent – polling just over 500 votes.</p>
      <p>The SNP’s Martin Docherty-Hughes, Labour’s Jean Anne Mitchell and the Conservatives’ Alix Mathieson are the other candidates who complete the ballot paper.</p>
