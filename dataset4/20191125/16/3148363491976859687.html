      <p>Buttigieg <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pfa-webapp/documents/PFA_Retirement_white_paper_final.pdf">announced</a> individuals earning above $250,000 (Families earning over $500,000) would face higher Social Security taxes if he is elected president.</p>
      <p>The mayor’s plan also suggested more wealthy seniors would also get “modest Social Security benefits” as a result of their additional taxes.</p>
      <p>Those earning less than $250,000 would not be taxed extra.</p>
      <p>Buttigeg made the announcement as his campaign released a lengthy policy plan on how to preserve Social Security in the future.</p>
      <p>“Politicians in Washington have known this crisis was intensifying for years,” the South Bend mayor wrote. “And for years, they have failed to address it. It is time for a new approach.”</p>
      <p>Buttigieg also floated a plan that would provide eligible elderly a benefit of $90 per day for long-term care, provided they meet income-related residents and going through a waiting period. The program would apply seniors who need living assistance but do not need around the clock care.</p>
      <p>The South Bend mayor also proposed creating a Public Option 401(k) that would offer workers lower investment fees and give Americans withdraw funds for financial emergencies.</p>
