      <p>Fans of Coronation Street will remember Curly who lived on the cobbles from 1983 until 2003.</p>
      <p>During his 20 years on the cobbles, Curly married Raquel Wolstenhulme in 1995.</p>
      <p>However, she only married Curly after Des Barnes hurt her, knowing Curly would respect her.</p>
      <p>But she walked out on him less than a year later to take a modelling opportunity in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
      <p>Raquel briefly returned in 2000 to tell Curly that she was getting remarried, but also dropped the news that she was pregnant when she left in 1996 and Curly had a daughter named Alice.</p>
      <p>Curly soon found love with policewoman Emma Taylor in 2000.</p>

      <p>The pair married in 2001 and the same year their son Ben was born.</p>

      <p>Two years later, Emma accepted a transfer to Newcastle and she and Curly decided to move with their son.</p>
      <p>Although Curly hasn't been seen in the TV series since 2003, his character appeared in the 2010 direct-to-DVD movie Coronation Street: A Knight's Tale.</p>
