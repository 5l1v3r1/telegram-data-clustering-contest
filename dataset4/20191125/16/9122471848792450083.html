      <h1>Jason Garrett Responds To Jerry Jones’ Postgame Comments</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:23:57+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Jerry Jones didn’t hold back with his comments about Jason Garrett and the coaching staff following the Cowboys’ loss to the Patriots on Sunday night. Dallas was extremely mistake-prone in its loss to New England at Gillette Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys’ owner basically blamed the coaching staff for the loss.</p>
      <p>“This is very frustrating. It’s frustrating just to be reminded that some of the fundamentals of football and coaching were what beat us out there today,” Jones said.</p>
      <p>Jones took specific aim at the Cowboys’ special teams. Dallas had a punt blocked and made multiple mistakes on kick return.</p>
      <p>“To me, special teams is 100 percent coaching. It’s 100 percent coaching. It’s strategy. It’s having players ready,” Jones said. “Special teams is nothing but coaching. Special teams is effort. Special teams is savvy. Special teams is thinking.”</p>

      <p>Garrett responded to Jones’ comments during his Monday morning radio show appearance in Dallas.</p>
      <p>“All I can say is we all obviously want to win,” Jones said. “Unfortunately, we didn’t get the job done yesterday.”</p>
      <p>Garrett admitted that everyone – coaches included – can be better.</p>

      <p>The Cowboys have been extremely frustrating this season, but they’re still leading the NFC East race at 6-5. Dallas will probably need to more than just win the division for Garrett and his coaching staff to be back in 2020, though.</p>
