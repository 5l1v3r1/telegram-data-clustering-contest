      <h1>Jeremy Corbyn rules out Lib Dem coalition as 'they happily signed up to austerit</h1>

      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has again insisted he will not form a coalition government – despite the polls suggesting he is unlikely to win a majority at the General Election.</p>
      <p>The Prime Ministerial candidate – who also addressed what his cabinet would look like and his regrets while leading <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/labour-party/">Labour </a>– was damning about possible coalition partners the Liberal Democrats but did not criticise the Scottish National Party (SNP).</p>
      <p>He said no deals would be done ‘in advance’ of the December 12 vote, but did not answer whether he would prefer to form a minority or coalition government.</p>
      <p>Speaking exclusively to Metro.co.uk at the launch of his party’s ‘Arts For All’ strategy yesterday, Mr Corbyn also hinted that he could write off student debt and bring in Universal Basic Income, while <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/jeremy-corbyn-says-people-will-continue-die-streets-tory-manifesto-11210008/">criticising the Conservatives for allowing to people to ‘die on our streets’</a>.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘We are not going into coalition. We are fighting this election to win it.</p>

      <p>‘The [2010 – 2015] coalition government brought us austerity with the Liberal Democrats happily signed up to it, so I really wonder what their political principles actually are.’</p>
      <p>Turning to the SNP, Mr Corbyn continued: ‘We are fighting to get Labour MPs elected in Scotland, we are not fighting to form a coalition government, we are not doing deals with anybody in advance of the election.’</p>
      <p>Labour are <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/tory-lead-labour-narrows-manifesto-launch-11214646/">currently polling at around 30%, compared to the Conservatives on 41%</a>, but will be hoping to narrow the gap in the 17 days between now and the election – much like they did in 2017.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn also refused to make any commitments about who would be in his cabinet if he wins in two weeks’ time, but said it would ‘reflect Britain’ on gender and ethnicity.</p>

      <p>Highlighting that he was the first leader to have half or more female shadow cabinet members, he explained: ‘In terms of a gender balance and in terms of ethnic diversity… I want our cabinet to reflect the diversity of our society, and I am determined to achieve that.’</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn’s party has also pledged to set up a Department for Women and Equalities, which Dawn Butler is the current Shadow Secretary of State for.</p>

      <p>But both the Labour leader and his Conservative counterpart Boris Johnson have refused to say who would be in their cabinets if they become PM.</p>
      <p>Asked what he regrets most from his time in his current role, Mr Corbyn suggested that he could have been more vocal on green issues.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I have always felt passionately about the environment and I’m proud that this year we did propose the climate [emergency] in parliament.</p>
      <p>‘I did raise this quite a lot in the leadership campaign in 2015, I think it has now moved centre stage, maybe I should have been much heavier on that to begin with – but I am very proud of what we are saying in the manifesto and looking forward to the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/channel-4-host-uks-first-ever-election-climate-change-debate-11197899/">environment debate on Thursday</a>.’</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said his manifesto – which has been criticised for softening a plan to be carbon neutral by 2030 – struck the ‘right balance’ between dealing with the climate crisis and ‘giving people hope’ by investing in green jobs.</p>
      <p>He said he was most proud to have ‘changed the nature of debate’ around austerity – suggesting that was the reason why he ran for the position, that he was widely expected not to win.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old explained: ‘My whole purpose of running for the leadership of the Labour party in 2015 was to say that austerity was a political choice, not an economic necessity and that we as a society had to invest for the future.’</p>
