      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/victoria-beckham/">Victoria Beckham</a> isn’t usually one to let her guard down when it comes to social media but it seems she has a weakness when it comes to her son, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/romeo-beckham/">Romeo</a>.</p>
      <p>The 45-year-old former Spice Girls member revealed on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ellen-degeneres/">The Ellen Degeneres Show</a> that her 17-year-old son recently ‘used’ her to get more TikTok followers.</p>
      <p>Ellen asked: ‘Is it Romeo that made you dance in the kitchen?’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>To which Posh Spice responded: ‘The TikTok!</p>
      <p>‘He came home the other day and he said “Mum, I’ve just joined TikTok – will you do a dance with me?”‘</p>
      <p>When Victoria asked Romeo what they should dance to, her son – of course – responded, Spice Up Your Life.</p>
      <p>After they were done dancing up a storm in the kitchen, Romeo took his mum’s phone and posted the video on Instagram, clearly showing off his own TikTok username for her 27 million followers to see.</p>
      <p>He then cheekily said: ‘That’ll get my numbers up!’</p>
      <p>Ellen responded: ‘He used you!’ and Victoria agreed.</p>

      <p>The former Spice Girl then said: ‘It was a lot of fun but I’ve got to say Romeo definitely takes after his dad with his moves.’</p>
      <p>Burn!</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Victoria opened up about the thing she’s most proud of in her life – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/victoria-beckham-proud-good-mother-admits-fame-can-great-11085829/">being a mother</a>.</p>
      <p>Chatting to Polish model Malgosia Bela for Vogue Poland, Victoria explained that her ‘two most important roles’ are as a mother and running her own business.</p>
      <p>Victoria, who’s been married to David Beckham since 1999, has four kids with the former footballer – Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper.</p>

      <p>Her children appear to be following in her footsteps, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/15/harper-beckham-poses-victoria-beckhams-new-line-sits-front-row-next-anna-wintour-london-fashion-week-10746747/">Brooklyn and Harper</a> both showing their faces at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/london-fashion-week/">London Fashion Week</a> earlier this year.</p>
