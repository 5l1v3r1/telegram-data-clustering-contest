      <h1>Half-life: Alyx is designed to run on the minimum GPU spec for last-gen VR</h1>

      <p>
        <b>The minimum specs for Half-life: Alyx have been revealed. Valve’s “killer VR app”, a prequel set between the events of Half-life and Half-life 2, is available across Steam VR-compatible headsets and will require just the bare minimum of last-gen mainstream graphics card grunt in order to run.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Half-Life: Alyx will only be available to play in VR, and could single-handedly sell more VR headsets than all other games on the platform put together. If you rank among the fans waiting patiently for over a decade, and are perhaps a little worried for your gaming PC’s aptitude for VR, don’t fret. Valve has published the minimum spec for its upcoming Half-life game and they are none too distressing for even modest rigs built in the past few years.</p>
      <p>Starting with the graphics card, you’ll need an <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/nvidia/geforce-gtx-1060-review-benchmarks">Nvidia GTX 1060 6GB</a> or <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/amd/radeon-rx-580-review-benchmarks">AMD RX 580 8GB</a> minimum in order to boot Half-Life: Alyx with any hope of reasonable frame rates, according to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/">Steam store page</a>. We don’t yet know what performance these mainstream cards will net you in-game. That will depend on the refresh rate your chosen virtual reality headset is capable of. For example, the Valve Index is capable of up to 144Hz across its twin panels – thirsty work for even the <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-graphics-card-2019">best graphics cards</a>.</p>
      <p>The RX 580 and GTX 1060 are some of the most populous cards on the market today according to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam">Steam Hardware Survey</a>.</p>
      <p>AMD’s RX 590 is currently cheaper than ever for Black Friday at <a href="https://www.newegg.com/sapphire-radeon-rx-590-100415p8gl/p/N82E16814202333?Item=N82E16814202333&amp;Description=rx%20590&amp;cm_re=rx_590-_-14-202-333-_-Product">$180</a> (<a href="https://www.overclockers.co.uk/powercolor-radeon-rx-590-red-dragon-8192mb-gddr5-pci-express-graphics-card-black-friday-deal-gx-197-pc.html">£150</a>).</p>
      <p>You will also have to purchase a VR headset if you haven’t already. All of the <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-vr-headset-pc">best VR headsets</a> will support Half-life: Alyx, which supports SteamVR across the board. That includes the Valve Index, HTC Vive Cosmos, Oculus Rift S, and Windows Mixed Reality headsets.</p>

      <p>An Intel Core i5 7500 or AMD Ryzen 5 1600 is recommended for Half-Life: Alyx. That’s a quad-core Intel chip, or a six-core, 12-thread AMD chip.</p>

      <p>Valve is definitely hoping to drive further sales of its flagship VR headset, the Index, with Half-life: Alyx. It’s introduced bonuses for Valve Index owners and anyone who purchases before 2019 – including skins, CS:GO content, and SteamVR environments.</p>
      <p>As if Half-life fans needed any other excuse to play the closest game to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life-3/half-life-3-release-date-story-gameplay-art">Half-Life 3</a> in over a decade…</p>
