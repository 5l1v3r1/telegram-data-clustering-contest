      <h1>Fume over 's***show Christmas light switch on 'so awful even Santa left'</h1>
      <h2>"It was a s***show. Embarrassment in all honesty."</h2>

      <p>People in Crosby are not happy after a 's***show' Christmas switch-on event on Friday night.</p>
      <p>One woman, Mandy Ryan, took to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/crosby">Facebook</a> to post her criticisms, which have since been liked and shared more than 80 times.</p>
      <p>Part of her post read: "I am absolutely embarrassed. Having living in Crosby all my life, I have never seen a turnout like [tonight's].</p>

      <p>"Santa left before the lights were even switched on.</p>
      <p>"I took it upon myself to leave and take my three-year-old daughter to the Thornton switch-on, she was crying by this point because she hadn't seen Santa.</p>
      <p>" <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/thornton">Thornton</a> had a good crowd and a lovely festive spirit. As for Crosby['s switch on]... you should hang your heads in shame."</p>

      <p>Lee Chesworth added: "I took my three-year-old twins and it was awful."</p>
      <p>It remains unknown who actually organised the event - but apparently the usual event had to be cancelled due to a "complaint".</p>
      <p>Local <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> councillors Michael Roche and Diane Roscoe usually organise the switch-on, but say they had to cancel this year's.</p>

      <p>Cllr Roche said: "We arranged everything and then had to cancel all the acts, the market, the stage, lights and generator as someone complained that it was too busy last year."</p>
      <p>Local business-owner Ian Scott suggested creating a fundraising page so Crosby can have a better <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/christmas-events">Christmas event</a> next year.</p>
      <p>He said: "The people who are moaning should put their money where their mouth is and contribute somehow. If we want better we need to help, not just complain.</p>
      <p>"If I set up a [funding] page for next year. I wonder how many of the amazing people of Crosby who love a good moan on here about the turn on would contribute?"</p>

      <p>It's not just people in Crosby who are disappointed.</p>
      <p>Christmas switch-on events in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/ainsdale">Ainsdale</a> and <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/waterloo">Waterloo</a> have been cancelled altogether.</p>
      <p>Ainsdale Civic Society said a lack of funds means the tradition event will not be held, although a large tree is on display in the village.</p>
      <p>In previous years, the festival has featured live music, children’s activities, fairground rides, Christmas shopping stalls, and entertainment from various local groups.</p>
      <p>But after funding cuts took their toll and previous events resulted in financial losses, Ainsdale Civic Society said no event will take place this year.</p>
      <p>Last year's event recouped only £1,000 of its £2,500 running costs while this summer’s gala ran at a £3,000 loss.</p>
      <p>Waterloo's Christmas evening usually runs in connection with Crosby Housing Association, but CHA say it will not take place this year.</p>
      <p>There will still, however, be a lit-up tree in Waterloo.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> understands <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/sefton-council">Sefton Council</a> has no budget for Council-run Christmas activities. The local authority has previously said 'this was removed as part of the budget setting process a number of years ago due to government cuts'.</p>
      <p>Sefton MBC did, however, give some grants to established community groups in all parts of the borough to help with the purchase of their own trees and lights.</p>
      <p>This year money (£800 each) was made available to groups in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/netherton">Netherton</a> , Waterloo, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/seaforth">Seaforth</a> , Crossens, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/birkdale">Birkdale</a> , Lydiate, Ford ward, Thornton, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/hightown">Hightown</a> , <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/bootle">Bootle</a> , Melling, Crosby and Hillside.</p>
      <p>Formby village also received £800 each from the council - to put towards the clean-up after their event, which was funded by donations from local businesses and residents.</p>
      <p>Southport's Christmas switch-on event was funded entirely by Southport Business Improvement District (BID) and received no money from Sefton Council.</p>
      <p>All Crosby councillors have been approached for comment.</p>
