      <p>Uber has lost its licence to operate in London after authorities deemed a "pattern of failures" was placing passengers and their safety at risk.</p>
      <p>Transport for London announced on Monday that it would not be renewing the taxi app firm's licence in the capital at the end of November.</p>
      <p>The service operates in the Welsh capital and now Cardiff council have responded to the decision.</p>
      <p>In a statement issued on Monday, TfL said: “Despite addressing some of these issues, TfL does not have confidence that similar issues will not reoccur in the future, which has led it to conclude that the company is not fit and proper at this time.”</p>

      <p>The ride hailing firm has <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/taxi-firm-uber-launching-cardiff-11206677">operated in Cardiff since April 2016</a> and has a five-year licence due for renewal in 2021.</p>
      <p>Now <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/corrections-clarifications/cardiff-council-10770818">Cardiff Council</a> has responded to the latest decision taken by TfL and said it had no reason to revoke Uber's licence in the Welsh capital.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Cardiff council said: "In <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff">Cardiff</a> , Uber was given an Operator’s Licence in September 2016 for five years. When issuing an Operator’s Licence, the Council has to be satisfied that the applicant is fit and proper to hold the licence.</p>
      <p>"As part of the conditions of this licence, the operator must ensure that they use properly vetted licensed drivers and vehicles.</p>
      <p>"As with all operators, the Council retains the power to suspend, revoke or refuse to renew an Operator Licence if there are sufficient grounds to do so.</p>
      <p>"At this stage, the Council has no information to suggest Uber are breaching their license conditions in Cardiff."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/uber-launched-newport-drivers-11983522">Uber launched in neighbouring Newport</a> in September 2016.</p>
      <p>In London <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/uber">Uber</a> was under a two-month probationary extension, granted in September this year, which demanded the company must address issues with checks on drivers, insurance and safety.</p>
      <p>TfL found that more than 14,000 trips were taken in London with more than 40 drivers who had faked their identity on the Uber app. Uber has said it will appeal and will be allowed to continue operating until the outcome of the official proceedings is decided.</p>
      <p>It is not the first time <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/cardiff-uber-licence-operate-london-13658730">TfL has rejected Uber’s licence renewal</a> .</p>
      <p>In September 2017, TfL announced that Uber London Limited was "not fit and proper to hold a private hire operator licence" and announced it's licence to operate in London would end that month.</p>
      <p>But the firm managed to persuade judges to award it a 15-month licence to continue.</p>

      <p>TfL said Uber had since made positive improvements, but serious reservations remained – including a change to systems that allowed unauthorised drivers to upload their photos to other drivers’ accounts.</p>
      <p>This security lapse resulted in at least 14,000 trips where someone other than the booked driver picked up passengers, TfL said.</p>
      <p>Uber is disappointed by the latest decision by TfL, saying it had worked hard to implement technical fixes to resolve the outstanding concerns.</p>
      <p>Jamie Heywood, Uber’s regional general manager, said: "TfL’s decision not to renew Uber’s licence in London is extraordinary and wrong, and we will appeal.</p>
      <p>"We have fundamentally changed our business over the last two years and are setting the standard on safety.</p>
      <p>"On behalf of the 3.5 million riders and 45,000 licensed drivers who depend on Uber in London, we will continue to operate as normal and will do everything we can to work with TfL to resolve this situation."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Is there a difference between Uber operating in Cardiff to Uber operating in London?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Uber operates under a franchise regime. The core operating model is the same across the country, but the licensed entity will be different. The company licensed to operate in London, Uber London Limited, is not the same company currently licensed to operate in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>In Cardiff, the licence is held by Uber Britannia who are required to meet Cardiff’s licence conditions. Uber operate under the same licence provisions as all the other Cardiff operators.</p>
      <p>“Uber drivers” may also undertake work for other private hire operators in the city and are not exclusively tied to Uber.</p>
      <p>Any driver licensed by the council have to be ‘fit and proper’ and will have undergone an enhanced DBS check and immigration checks to ensure the drivers have a right to work in the country.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Cardiff council added: “Any decision by the Public Protection Committee to revoke an operator or a driver licence must be based on evidence. The company then has a right to appeal any decision to the Magistrates Court."</p>
