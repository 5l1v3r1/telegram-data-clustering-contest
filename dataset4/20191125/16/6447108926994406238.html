      <p>That’s not all players will get as the Paris track will be added for all players across all game modes, and it will feature three different layouts. If you’re yet to play GRID you can check out what Thomas thought below:</p>
      <blockquote>GRID is an enjoyable racing game for those who want to enjoy some close racing without worrying about camber angles. The market needs games like this to provide light and shade. I was hoping this new GRID would be a fresh start, but it’s last night’s takeaway re-heated. I enjoy leftovers – cold pizza is one of life’s great pleasures – but that doesn’t make the perfect racing game when the rest of the world has moved on.</blockquote>
