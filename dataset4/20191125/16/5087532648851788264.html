      <h3>iPhone 5G Sales Expected to Beat iPhone 11 Sales</h3>
      <p>If correct, this would fairly significant uptick in sales. It is understood that Apple expects to sell between 70 and 80 million units of the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max.</p>
      <p>Of course, there has been no official confirmation that a 5G iPhone is on its way. However, such a device is widely expected. <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/link/all-major-carriers-to-have-5g-by-2020-predicts-qualcomm-president/">Qualcomm</a> said on its recent earnings call that it expects that 200 million 5G smartphones will be sold in 2020. The chipmaker <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-5g/qualcomms-5g-phone-forecast-for-2020-could-include-iphones-analysts-idUSKBN1XH03G">suggested</a> this will include a flagship device in the Autumn. Analysts understood this to mean an iPhone.</p>
