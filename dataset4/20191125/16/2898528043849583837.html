      <p><a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1673/sergio-moraes">Sergio Moraes</a> is no longer part of the UFC roster, multiple sources told MMA Fighting.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian jiu-jitsu ace was let go by the promotion following his third-round TKO defeat to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/674/james-krause">James Krause</a> in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on Nov. 16. Moraes leaves the company on a three-fight skid that includes defeats to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4761/anthony-rocco-martin">Anthony Rocco Martin</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2897/warlley-alves">Warlley Alves</a>.</p>
      <p>The Bellator and Jungle Fight veteran joined the UFC after competing on the first season of The Ultimate Fighter: Brazil in 2012, when he ended up in the middleweight final as a replacement for injured <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1676/daniel-sarafian">Daniel Sarafian</a>. “The Panther” lost a decision to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1674/cezar-ferreira">Cezar Ferreira</a> in the reality show final.</p>

      <p>The 37-year-old veteran won three jiu-jitsu world championships before making the transition full-time to MMA, defeating the likes of <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3446/kron-gracie">Kron Gracie</a> (twice), Victor Estima, Alan Finfou, Rodrigo Cavaca, Romulo Barral and Braga Neto.</p>
