      <h1>Post Malone Won Favorite Rap Album at 2019 American Music Awards and People Are Pissed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:41:20+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/tonycenteno/" target="_blank">Tony M. Centeno</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.vividseats.com/concerts/post-malone-tickets.html?wsUser=906&amp;utm_source=ts&amp;utm_campaign=Q2&amp;utm_medium=affiliate">Post Malone</a> left the 2019 American Music Awards with a trophy for Favorite Album - Rap/Hip-Hop and a lot of people aren't happy about it.</p>
      <p>On Sunday night (Nov. 24), Posty was nominated in the category for his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hollywoods-Bleeding-Explicit-Post-Malone/dp/B07X3QM2K9?SubscriptionId=AKIAJYPOGEBYCEUS42SQ&amp;tag=xxlmagtsm-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B07X3QM2K9"><i>Hollywood's Bleeding</i></a> album along with other notable acts like Meek Mill for his <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/reviews/2018/12/meek-mill-championships-album-review/"><i>Championships</i></a> album and Travis Scott for his <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/reviews/2018/08/travis-scott-astroworld-album-review/"><i>Astroworld</i></a> album. Once the <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/10/post-malone-congratulations-diamond-riaa/">"Congratulations"</a> rapper was dubbed the winner, all sorts of critics hit up their Twitter timelines to express their discontent with the AMAs' decision.</p>
      <p>"Post Malone. Best Rap Album. Get the entire fuck outta here," one Twitter user said.</p>

      <p>Most people were in shock that Post, <a href="https://www.vividseats.com/concerts/post-malone-tickets.html?wsUser=906&amp;utm_source=ts&amp;utm_campaign=Q2&amp;utm_medium=affiliate">who recently closed out his national tour</a>, won over Meek and Travis. Others believe that he shouldn't have won over the aforementioned nominated artists.</p>
      <p>"I fuck with Post Malone. But he shouldn’t have won best rap album.... not rap...," another Twitter user said.</p>

      <p>Before the hate manifested online, Posty's acceptance speech got plenty of attention after he slipped in his love for grapes.</p>
      <p>"I'm not too good at talking in front of people but I just wanna say thank you so much to everybody who showed love and support," Post said during his acceptance speech. "And honestly, words cannot express how grateful and thankful I am for everything that y'all have shown me. I just wanna say thank you to everybody on the camp and on the team and thank you for all the fans for showing love and support. We busted our ass for it so, you know, it feels good to walk away and, uh, we love you very much and I love grapes. So, thank you so much."</p>

      <p>“We did this show in Atlanta on Ty [Dolla $ign]’s tour. We was all on the tour bus and it was a bunch of people I didn’t meet. Ty’s tour bus was like the fuckin’ Source Awards. But everybody was on there—Trouble, Migos, everybody. I’m going to introduce myself to everybody and everybody would be like, ‘Come on, dog, we know who you are. When we workin’? What we doin’?’ That was crazy, but I brought Jermaine [Dupri] out. I brought Hoodrich Pablo Juan out and he did a song; I brought [Lil] Scrappy out and he did 'Head Bussa.' And then I closed my set with Jermaine and he did 'Welcome to Atlanta' in Atlanta and the whole crowd went crazy. Like, no one really brings JD out to do that, so I’m thinking that’s Jay-Z level. That’s crazy. Do we have footage? I need that.”</p>

      <p>"I had a room, right? So I go in my hotel room and it was a girl that worked there. I don't know if she got drunk and got bold to do it, but when I go back in the room, she came out the drawer. She hid in my room until I got back and came out of the drawer. I think we were in Houston. I put her out—you gotta roll."</p>

      <h3>Emilio Rojas</h3>
      <p>“We were on the road with Dizzy Wright. I think it was like, Albuquerque, N.M. Or it might have been El Paso—one of those fuckin’ places. There were a bunch of fans arguing and screaming in the parking lot. Our security—his name is DJ—came and got me and was like, ‘Yo, you gotta check this out.’</p>
      <p>My first reaction is to jump in between them and try to make sure that everything’s cool, you know? Didn’t realize these kids were heavily gang-affiliated. You ever seen that movie, <i>Only the Strong</i>, where they sing, ‘Ba, na, na, weh,’ and they’re kinda stabbing at each other with knives and shit? It was some shit like that and I was in between them. They were trying to poke each other so I was like, ‘Y’all wanna keep having hip-hop shows? Y’all gotta stop this shit right now,’ so the crowd kinda dispersed. I foolishly thought it dispersed because I made an impact and I was like, 'Yeah, I fuckin’ killed this shit, brought the peace in.' Two seconds later, you hear tires screeching—one of the kids who was involved in the tussle, his peoples had pulled up. Crowd scatters. I’m not a street dude, like, fuck that shit. So I was like fuck it, I booked it to the merch, behind the merch truck. I was duckin’ and then the fighting still kept on going.</p>
      <p>Have you ever seen a hockey fight where they pull the shirt over? So these kids, one of them pulled the shirt over, he finally cut the other kid and he was just laying, bleeding in the parking lot. It was crazy. The police were on their own schedule. It was a good five, six minutes that passed. At a Dizzy Wright show, too. We’re like, peaceful; everybody’s chillin’.”</p>

      <p>"I was fuckin' performing and I just see something fly on the stage. This huge-ass item fly on the stage. Boom! I stopped the show. 'Yo, what the fuck? Who the fuck threw this shit on the stage?' I see a group of dudes ganged up in the corner. I'm like, 'Yo listen, I'ma fuck yall niggas up!' I continue the show, go home. I go in my Instagram messages, Some girl hits me up. She goes 'Did you get the cookie, filled with gelato, that I threw on the stage?' I'm like, 'Why would you throw some shit on the stage? You threw a cookie of all things. You had niggas in the crowd like, 'Ohhh,' why you do that shit?' I followed her right after though. We're friends now. I just hit her up the other day like, 'Yo, you good?'"</p>
