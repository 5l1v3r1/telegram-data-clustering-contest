      <p>Presenter <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/holly-willoughby/">Holly Willoughby</a> has hit back at claims she uses body tape to enhance her boobs.</p>
      <p>The entrepreneurs behind Perky Pear body tape were reported to have said the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/">This Morning</a> presenter, 38, was among their customers and "loves" using their Lift &amp; Shape Tape.</p>

      </p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/holly-willoughby-hits-back-claims-20952059">Daily Star</a>, twin sisters Samantha and Charlotte Ryder were quoted as saying: "Holly Willoughby is a customer, she messaged us saying how much she loves it."ho</p>
      <p>But a rep for the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/holly-willoughby/holly-willoughby-shares-rare-picture-of-her-kids-enjoying-a-dreamy-night-at-winter-wonderland/">mum-of-three</a> - nicknamed Holly Willoughbooby by cheeky <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/celebrity-juice-fans-mark-wright-dives-through-naked-mans-legs/">Celebrity Juice host Keith Lemon</a> - rubbished the claims and insisted she's "never heard" of Perky Pear boob tape.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson said: "She has never heard of it. She has never used the tape herself, nor has she messaged the manufacturers.</p>
      <aside>She has never used the tape herself.</aside>
      <p>"Holly does work with a number of stylists and it is possible that they know something about it. But as far as she is concerned she has never worn it."</p>
      <p>An updated story published by the Star quoted a source close to Perky Pair, who revealed there had been something of a misunderstanding.</p>
      <p>They told the paper: "A stylist who said she worked with Holly ordered £200 worth of the tape and said they would try it on her. But [Samantha and Charlotte] did not receive a message from Holly.</p>
      <p>"That message was actually from Gemma Collins who said she loved the product. A local newspaper the girls spoke to missquoted them.''</p>
      <p>ED! contacted Holly's reps for comment</p>

      <p>Siblings Samantha and Charlotte came up with the idea for Perky Pear after Samantha used her grandmother's physiotherapy tape on her own bust.</p>
      <p>Former Geordie Shore star <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/vicky-pattison-claims-adele-roberts-could-have-ruined-roman-kemps-career-with-prejudice-accusation/">Vicky Pattison</a> is understood to be among Perky Pear's famous customers, as is <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/reality-tv/love-island/">Love Island</a> 2017 contestant Gabby Allen and Amber Turner from <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/reality-tv/the-only-way-is-essex/">TOWIE</a>.</p>
      <p>Holly's appearance <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/holly-willoughby/this-morning-viewers-left-divided-over-holly-willoughbys-floral-granny-dress/">often comes under scrutiny</a>, particularly when she's presenting This Morning alongside co-host <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/phillip-schofield/">Phillip Schofield</a> in front of hundreds of thousands of viewers.</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, the star was accused of wearing an inappropriate dress for work.</p>
      <p>She took to Instagram to share a snap of her outfit choice, as she usually does, but some of her followers thought it was "too short" for her daytime TV role.</p>

      <p>The photo showed the star smiling in a £380 burgundy leather mini dress from fashion company Whistles.</p>
      <p>A number of her fans loved the look, with one writing, "Omg love this" and another commenting, "Oh wow, Holly. Love this dress on you, one of my favourite outfits".</p>
      <p>But others didn't agree and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/holly-willoughby/holly-willoughby-fans-claim-dress-not-appropriate/">claimed it was "not appropriate" for This Morning</a>.</p>
