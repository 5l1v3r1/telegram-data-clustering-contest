      <p>Gasly has had a very tumultuous year, struggling in the first half of the season in the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Aston Martin Red Bull Racing</a> car but then looking very impressive after being demoted to Toro Rosso.</p>

      <p>The 23-year-old has been consistently quicker than teammate <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/daniil-kvyat">Daniil Kvyat</a> in the STR14, with his spectacular P2-finish in Brazil being the feather in his cap. </p>
      <p>Looking ahead to next season already, the 23-year-old wants to unwind with family and loved ones first before getting stuck back into his training regime.</p>
      <p><i>"I will spend some time with friends and family in France for a couple of weeks around Christmas time, as I had hardly had any time to see them this year because my work schedule was so busy,"</i> Gasly stated ahead of this weekend's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.</p>

        <i>"After that, I'll start training seriously, going to Red Bull's training camp in the States from the end of December to be as well prepared as possible for next season.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"The best way to enjoy the winter break is to do well in the last race of the year and that's another reason to work really hard on this final weekend in Abu Dhabi."</i>
