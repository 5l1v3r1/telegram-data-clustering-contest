      <h1>Richard Sherman Unloads On Critics of Jimmy Garoppolo (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>The San Francisco 49ers probably put together their most impressive showing as a unit on Sunday night en route to a convincing win over the Green Bay Packers.</p>
      <p>Following the game, San Francisco 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman spoke with reporters after Sunday’s 37-8 home win and went on a short rant about outside criticism he continues to hear about 49ers QB Jimmy Garoppolo.</p>
      <p>“Jimmy Garoppolo is our leader and we will follow him into the darkest of dark, follow him into a dark alley and I guarantee you won’t touch him,” Sherman said Sunday night. “He goes to battle and fights for us every day and we have an obligation to go to battle and fight for him. And you hear some of the noise and things said about him and it’s frustrating because we see him every day, we see what kind of work ethic he puts in, the hours that he puts in preparing, the first one in, the last one out. The guy looks for no credit. All he does is encourage his teammates and put more work in. And then you have people nitpicking.”</p>

      <p>“We run for 300 yards and they’re like, ‘Well, he didn’t throw a lot.’ We ran for 300 yards! Then he throws for 400 and they’re like, ‘Well, I think he got outplayed by Kyler Murray,’ and Kyler Murray barely had 100 yards passing.</p>
      <p>“You start to laugh at these things, but the goal posts keep moving with him.”</p>
      <p>Garoppolo completed 14-of-20 passes for 253 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions, with his season numbers coming to 2,731 passing yards, 20 touchdowns, 10 interceptions and 100.6 passer rating.</p>
