      <p>What we love about Innocent Bones is its wry take on classic crafting. Its cross stitch kits are not the usual fare and feature slogans like 'No Bad Vibes', 'Do What You Love', 'Fries Before Guys' and some others too rude to mention here. Every kit comes with the required thread, a needle, fabric, pattern and embroidery hoop. These will go down well with the sarcastic, sassy and teenage in your life.</p>
