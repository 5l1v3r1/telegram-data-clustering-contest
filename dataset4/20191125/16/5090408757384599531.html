      <h4>The best controller</h4>
      <h4>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=nintendo%2Bswitch%2Bpro%2Bcontroller&amp;amp;qid=1552094039&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_031319_best-nintendo-switch-accessories-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;linkId=e095362bfffe47750672ce64ee7622de&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325">Pro Controller</a> makes playing on the Switch feel more like console gaming.</h4>
      <p>The Switch is both a portable and console gaming device, but when it’s in console mode – connected to a TV – the Joy-Con controllers aren’t exactly the most ergonomic to use when they are removed from the device, especially if you have large hands. Instead, opt for the wireless <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=nintendo%2Bswitch%2Bpro%2Bcontroller&amp;amp;qid=1552094039&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_031319_best-nintendo-switch-accessories-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;linkId=e095362bfffe47750672ce64ee7622de&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325">Nintendo Switch Pro Controller</a>, a full-sized gaming controller that’s easy to hold, feels great, and solidly built.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=nintendo%2Bswitch%2Bpro%2Bcontroller&amp;amp;qid=1552094039&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_031319_best-nintendo-switch-accessories-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;linkId=e095362bfffe47750672ce64ee7622de&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325">Pro Controller</a> has two joysticks, along with a directional pad (D-pad), A/B/X/Y buttons, and the Nintendo Switch plus and minus buttons in the middle. There is also a home button and a screen-capture button; rumble and motion control; and NFC for Nintendo’s Amiibo toy figurines.</p>
      <p>The controller is pricey, but we think its build quality and features add value, and it is the best Switch controller we’ve used. We have experienced some wireless connectivity issues, but nothing we would consider a problem. <i>– Christian de Looper</i></p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Well-designed, makes certain games more comfortable to play</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Pricey, connectivity issues</p>

      <h4>Extend the Switch’s battery life with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DMFL3SJ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_031319_best-nintendo-switch-accessories-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B07DMFL3SJ&amp;amp;linkId=1864a190e01564b29420c742e2911f62">Anker Powercore 13400 Nintendo Switch Edition</a> so that your gameplay doesn’t get interrupted.</h4>
      <p>According to Nintendo, the battery life on the original Nintendo Switch (2017) is approximately 2.5 to 6.5 hours, while an updated version (2019), with more efficient power usage, yields about 4.5 to 9 hours; the Switch Lite averages between 3 to 7 hours. If you’re an avid gamer and you have all the settings on high – brightness on high and Wi-Fi enabled, for example – you should bring along a portable USB power bank to lengthen the battery life. Our pick is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DMFL3SJ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_031319_best-nintendo-switch-accessories-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B07DMFL3SJ&amp;amp;linkId=1864a190e01564b29420c742e2911f62">Anker PowerCore 13400 Nintendo Switch Edition</a>.</p>
      <p>You might be thinking, can’t you use any power bank since they are all the same? No: Because of the significant amount of power the Switch draws (more so when it’s in use), you need a power bank that supports USB-C Power Delivery (PD) fast charging. As for capacity, you would want as your budget allows; 10,000 mAh should be the minimum. And, you’ll need a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-usb-c-cable">USB-C-to-USB-C cable</a>.</p>
      <p>Considering speed, capacity, and price, we like Anker’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DMFL3SJ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_031319_best-nintendo-switch-accessories-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B07DMFL3SJ&amp;amp;linkId=1864a190e01564b29420c742e2911f62">PowerCore 13400 Nintendo Switch Edition</a>. Switch-brand licensing aside, the battery is rated to support the full amount of power that the Switch draws. You can expect between 3 to 4 hours of playtime, depending on settings; it has a capacity of 13,400mAh. There’s no way to neatly attach the battery to the back of the Switch, but the PowerCore 13400 Nintendo Switch Edition is compact enough for travel. The power bank also works with smartphones and other portable devices and comes with a USB-C-to-USB-C cable. When used with a PD power adapter, the power bank recharges in about 4 hours, but the adapter is optional.</p>
      <p>There aren’t many portable batteries specifically designed for the Switch. The few we found either came from unfamiliar brands or had batteries that were too small, not to mention pricey. For your money, we didn’t feel they were worth considering and you’d get more value out of a standard power bank, as they can also be used to recharge phones, tablets, and other small USB-powered devices.</p>
      <p>We also didn’t consider power banks that use Qualcomm’s Quick Charge technology, since the Switch does not support it. We want to note that you could theoretically use a power bank you already own, but unless it supports fast charging, it may not deliver the performance that’s needed. However, it’s probably fine for recharging overnight when you’re not playing.</p>
      <p>The big downside might be the cost. For around the same price or less, you can usually find higher-capacity USB-C PD power banks, including ones from Anker, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HBTY3Z2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_031319_best-nintendo-switch-accessories-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B07HBTY3Z2&amp;amp;linkId=3dbe1864d86ff53a68923a2abbeeca2d">PowerCore Essential 20000 PD</a>. If the Nintendo certification doesn’t matter to you, opt for something less expensive – just use a reliable brand with a good warranty. On a positive note, Anker’s power banks tend to be value products. We have used them for years and found them to be reliable and perform well. <i>– Les Shu</i></p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Licensed by Nintendo, compact, fast charging (USB-C Power Delivery), USB-C cable included, can be used with phones and some laptops</p>
      <p><b>Cons: </b>Pricey compared to other power banks with similar or larger capacities, no fast-charging wall adapter included</p>

      <h4>The best microSD card</h4>

      <p>The Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite have only 32GB of onboard storage, which is barely enough for two games (“Zelda: Breath of the Wild” takes up more than 13GB alone). Our recommendation is to get one of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073JYC4XM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biip_090519_cyber-monday-tech-deals-2019-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B073JYC4XM&amp;amp;linkId=65289f4880aba816a41e27d0dedb8228">SanDisk’s Ultra microSDXC card</a> with a capacity of 128GB or more.</p>
      <p>Here’s why we like this card. The SanDisk Ultra is more than fast enough to meet Nintendo’s stated requirements, although it isn’t the fastest card you can buy, so we wouldn’t repurpose this for, say, 4K video shooting with a GoPro. But speed isn’t the priority here; it’s capacity and with this card, you get a lot of storage space for the money. You can get a 128GB card for $20 or less, and a 256GB card is less than $40. We see these cards go on sale often, so we wouldn’t be surprised to see them heavily discounted.</p>
      <p>SanDisk makes a Nintendo-licensed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KXQX3S3/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biip_090519_cyber-monday-tech-deals-2019-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B07KXQX3S3&amp;amp;linkId=21511f12807fd03219167f729fb21c34">128GB MicroSDXC card</a>. It costs a bit more, but from what we could tell, it has the same specs as the SanDisk Ultra. Pass on this and save the money unless you really want the card to say Nintendo Switch on it.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-micro-sd-card">See our guide on the best microSDXC cards you can buy</a>. <i>– Les Shu</i></p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Great value for a high-capacity card, meets Nintendo Switch’s speed requirements for SD card, durable, up to 512GB</p>
      <p><b>Cons: </b>Pricey compared to other power banks with similar or larger capacities, no fast-charging wall adapter included</p>

Besides the Switch with Joy-Con controllers attached, there’s room up to eight games, cables, extra Joy-Con controllers, and other small accessories you may need for gaming-on-the-go. We also like that the game cartridges holder doubles as a screen protector when the whole thing is zipped up and closed. There’s also a carry-handle.</p>

When the Switch is docked in console mode, you can connect the wireless transmitter to a USB port on the dock and use the headphones wirelessly. When it’s in handheld mode, simply connect the headphones to the Switch’s headphone jack. (The Switch does have Bluetooth, but it can’t be used with headphones.) <i>– Christian de Looper</i></p>

      <p>As with any portable device, the screen on the Nintendo Switch can be easily scratched if it isn’t properly protected – like throwing it into a backpack. For a strong, protective screen protector, we recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N3ASPNV/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_031319_best-nintendo-switch-accessories-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01N3ASPNV&amp;amp;linkId=ea0b9aa503aa65867210c84ab5ff5db0">amFilm Tempered Glass Screen Protector</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s a little thicker than other screen protectors, at 0.3 millimeters, which makes it harder to cut through it. In the box, you get two screen protectors – if one gets damaged, there’s another one to replace it – and wet wipes and microfiber cloth to clean the screen before applying the protector.</p>
      <p>The downside: Given the thickness, it’s more noticeable than other screen protectors. <i>– Christian de Looper</i></p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Thick, two in the box, inexpensive</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Thickness makes it noticeable</p>

      <h4>Charging Joy-Con and Pro controllers is relatively easy with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075FF6HDN/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_031319_best-nintendo-switch-accessories-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B075FF6HDN&amp;amp;linkId=4b75f90cd78ed43cd7dffc727dea69da">PowerA Joy-Con and Pro Controller Charging Dock</a>.</h4>
      <p>While the Joy-Con controllers can be recharged when attached to the Nintendo Switch, it’s more convenient to use the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075FF6HDN/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_031319_best-nintendo-switch-accessories-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B075FF6HDN&amp;amp;linkId=4b75f90cd78ed43cd7dffc727dea69da">PowerA Joy-Con and Pro Controller Charging Dock</a>. In addition, if you own the Pro Controller, it will recharge that too.</p>
      <p>The dock is a great way to keep things organized. It looks basic, but it complements the Switch dock. It is also cheaper than many other charging docks for the Nintendo Switch, and, if you care about such things, it’s officially licensed by Nintendo.</p>
      <p>In our test, the dock works well, but the included USB-C cable for charging the Pro Controller isn’t very strong. <i>– Christian de Looper</i></p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Charges Joy-Con and Pro Controllers, well-designed, inexpensive</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Wire is flimsy</p>

      <p>The Pro Controller we recommended is more conducive to console-style gaming, but if the price is a turn-off or you just don’t want a bulky controller, stick with the Joy-Con controllers but add this affordable accessory, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072KH7CHV/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_031319_best-nintendo-switch-accessories-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B072KH7CHV&amp;amp;linkId=b625831dfbd420c34f0f1db868071407">MoKo Grip</a>.</p>
      <p>Coming in a pack of two, the grip, made of resin, is a sleeve that you wrap around a Joy-Con controller, giving it handles that make holding a Joy-Con more comfortable. It also has left and right buttons trigger buttons. There are plenty of similar products like this, but we like the MoKo because it provides a better fit.</p>
      <p>Having tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072KH7CHV/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_031319_best-nintendo-switch-accessories-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B072KH7CHV&amp;amp;linkId=b625831dfbd420c34f0f1db868071407">MoKo Grips</a>, we find them to enhance the experience of playing multiplayer fighting games like “Super Smash Bros.” where you would want a tighter hold on the controller as you mash those buttons, as well as lengthy solo gameplay like “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.”</p>
      <p>Where the grips don’t work are games where you need to use the controller vertically, like “Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu!” or “Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee.” Also, it’s not an improvement over the Pro Controller since they don’t offer those large buttons and analog sticks, but it’s an affordable upgrade nonetheless. <i>– Christian de Looper</i></p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Comfortable, inexpensive, great for multiplayer games</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Not for games that require vertical use of Joy-Con controller</p>

      <p>“Super Smash Bros. Ultimate” is an immensely popular Nintendo Switch game, and die-hard fans swear by a controller for an old Nintendo console that actually came out in 2001: the GameCube. Nintendo took notice – so much so that it introduced a GameCube controller for the Switch specifically for “Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,” which is now hard to come by. If you don’t own an old GameCube controller (you can use it with the Switch via an adapter), you can get a third-party option, like this licensed product from PowerA, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GXKCX6Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=biipgf_031319_best-nintendo-switch-accessories-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B07GXKCX6Y&amp;amp;linkId=523e361a9282fe142cef460db59e283a">GameCube Style Wireless Controller</a>.</p>
      <p>This controller looks identical to the classic GameCube controller, but it has extra buttons for the Nintendo Switch: home, plus, and minus. Apart from that, you get the large “A” and shoulder buttons that make this controller popular with gamers. Since it works over Bluetooth, no wires are required. Unlike using an original GameCube controller, this one has motion controls.</p>
      <p>While the controller works with nearly all Switch games, it doesn’t have the rumble function. And, it’s powered by two AA batteries instead of a rechargeable one; PowerA claims 30 hours of gameplay, so either have spares handy or use rechargeable AA batteries. Another downer: It’s expensive. <i>– Christian de Looper and Les Shu</i></p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Feels like original GameCube controller, wireless, great for “Super Smash Bros. Ultimate”</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Expensive, AA batteries instead of rechargeable, no rumble</p>
