      <h1>R. Kelly Says Joycelyn Savage Left Him Because His Money Ran Out</h1>

      <p>Recently, Joycelyn Savage came out and made claims about her former boyfriend R. Kelly, saying he peed on her, abused her, and more. Now, Kelly and his team are saying Savage is trying to exploit the singer.</p>
      <p>R. Kelly’s lawyer Steve Greenberg released a statement saying “It is unfortunate that Jocelyn now seeks to make money by exploiting her long time, loving relationship with Robert. Obviously if she were to tell the truth no one would pay so she has, unfortunately, chosen to regurgitate the stories and lies told by others for her own personal profit. We know the real facts, and it was not until the money ran out that she decided anything was wrong. Hopefully people will see it for the obvious profiteering it is.”</p>
