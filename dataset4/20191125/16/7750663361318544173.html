      <h1>How Chelsea could line up against Valencia</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/"><b>Chelsea</b></a> make the trip to Spain to face <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/valencia/"><b>Valencia</b></a> knowing that victory will put them on the brink of qualifying for the knockout stages of the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/"><b>Champions League</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>After fighting back to earn a 4-4 draw against Ajax earlier this month, the Blues - as well as the Dutch side and Valencia - are all locked on seven points in Group H.</p>
      <p>However, Chelsea travel to The Mestalla on the back of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/result/result-mahrez-nets-winner-as-man-city-overcome-chelsea_380403.html">a 2-1 defeat at Manchester City</a>, a result which ended their run of six successive wins in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> predicts how Chelsea could line up for the showdown with the La Liga outfit.</p>

      <p><b>Out:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ruben-loftus-cheek/"><b>Ruben Loftus-Cheek</b></a> (Achilles), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/antonio-rudiger/"><b>Antonio Rudiger</b></a> (groin),<br/><b>Doubtful:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ross-barkley/"><b>Ross Barkley</b></a> (ankle), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/callum-hudson-odoi/"><b>Callum Hudson-Odoi</b></a> (hamstring)</p>
      <p>After <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/frank-lampard/"><b>Frank Lampard</b></a> opted for more defensive qualities in his midfield at the Etihad Stadium, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mason-mount/"><b>Mason Mount</b></a> is expected to be handed a recall on Wednesday evening.</p>
      <p>Providing that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ngolo-kante/"><b>N'Golo Kante</b></a> came through the clash with the top-flight champions unscathed, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mateo-kovacic/"><b>Mateo Kovacic</b></a> is likely to be the player to drop out of the team.</p>
      <p>There are several other squad members who are pushing for a start, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andreas-christensen/"><b>Andreas Christensen</b></a> now fit after a hamstring injury and Callum Hudson-Odoi close to shaking off a similar issue.</p>
      <p>However, with Chelsea having had four days to recover from the game in Manchester, Lampard may decide to keep alterations down to a minimum.</p>
      <p>Should Ross Barkley be available after an ankle problem, the playmaker will only be selected among the replacements.</p>
