      <h1>Here's where to pick herbs in Shenmue 3 to make yourself some quick cash</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:44:08+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/elizabeth-henges/" target="_blank">Elizabeth Henges</a></address>
      <p>Looking for some Shenmue 3 herbs? Finding herbs is a great way of making some quick cash, especially in the early game. You can pick up herbs for free around Bailu Village, if you know where to look. There are also maps you can acquire to help point you in the right direction, but you can sidestep that by checking out the following guide.</p>
      <p>Once you have them you can sell your herb sets to line your wallet for the tasks ahead. But, where are they all? Find out more with this Shenmue 3 herb locations breakdown.</p>
      <h3>How to find Shenmue 3 herbs</h3>
      <p>You’ll be able to start looking for herbs as early as the second day in Shenmue 3—after Shenhua points out a stalk of licorice you can pick along the road. Various herbs are available to be found in the village, and different herb sets yield different amounts of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-way-to-make-shenmue-3-money-quick-fast-easy-yuan/">Shenmue 3 money</a>. Some of the best combinations can net you upwards of 300 or 400 Yuan.</p>
      <p>But here's the best part: the herbs are practically everywhere. If you head off the beaten paths of Bailu Village and explore the fields and behind houses, you’re bound to find some herbs to pick. When you get near some, a red circle appears above it to indicate that the plant is ready to be plucked.</p>
      <p>There are also a few free herb maps you can get to help you in your search. You can pick up two herb maps right outside Tao-Get, and two more outside of Kong Mei Goods in Panda Market. If you haven't unlocked the latter area yet, just keep plugging through that main story until you do.</p>
