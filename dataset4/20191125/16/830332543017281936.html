      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:05:37+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:05</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Valinsky, CNN Business</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - EBay is selling its StubHub ticketing businesses to Viagogo, a European rival, in a $4 billion deal.</p>
      <p>The two companies announced the all-cash deal Monday. Once completed, the combined company will be massive: It expects to sell hundreds of thousands of tickets each day across more than 70 countries.</p>
      <p>EBay interim CEO Scott Schenkel said in a press release that the transaction "maximizes long-term value for eBay shareholders" and concluded this was the "best path forward for both eBay and StubHub."</p>
      <p>Schenkel replaced Devin Wenig, who<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/25/tech/ebay-ceo/index.html"> stepped down</a> as eBay's president and CEO in September.</p>
      <p>Eric Baker, Viagogo's founder and CEO, said in a statement that he had long wished to combine the two rivals. He claims the merger "creates a win-win for fans."</p>
      <p>EBay bought StubHub for $310 million in 2007. The website sells tickets for a variety of events, including sports and concerts. Viagogo is a Switzerland-based company that also resells tickets, mostly for sporting events including European football, rugby and cricket.</p>
      <p>Viagogo has <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/08/news/companies/world-cup-fifa-ticket-resales/index.html">had its share of problems</a>. During the FIFA World Cup in 2018, the governing body of the soccer tournament filed a criminal complaint against the company from consumers and watchdog groups about "opaque and deceptive business conduct." It was also in hot water from the United Kingdom for similar "deceptive" practices.</p>
      <p>Selling off StubHub comes amid a broader review of eBay's businesses. The e-commerce company announced in March that it was a initiating a strategic examination of its assets following pressure from activist investors to spin off or sell StubHub and its Classifieds Group.</p>
      <p>The changes were propelled by Elliott Management, a hedge fund that disclosed a 4% stake in the company in January and began agitating for change. Elliott is the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/28/tech/att-elliot-management-deal/index.html">same firm that pushed</a> for changes at AT&amp;T, owner of WarnerMedia.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, eBay also announced a restructuring that would bring <a href="http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001065088/f6e84bf3-b099-4c15-aaf7-ca5fa5f7406a.pdf">various regional marketplace units</a> under one global leadership team.</p>
      <p>Shares of eBay spiked nearly 1.75% in early trading Monday. The stock is up roughly 27% for the year.</p>
      <p>The sale is scheduled to close in the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approvals.</p>
