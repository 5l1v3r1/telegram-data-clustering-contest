        <li><a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/uk-digital-assets-property-legal-law/"><b>Ledger Insights: Major UK Legal Panel Considers Digital Assets are Property</b></a>Reported by <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/e-currencies-are-equivalent-to-property-legal-panel-declares-r3265kx5v">The Times</a>, a legal panel headed by the Chancellor of the High Court, Sir Geoffrey Vos, issued a statement classifying cryptoassets as property in the U.K. since they “have all of the indicia of property,” giving crypto and blockchain a legal standing similar to physical assets, “Novel or distinctive features possessed by some crypto-assets — intangibility, cryptographic authentication, use of a distributed transaction ledger, decentralisation, rule by consensus — do not disqualify them from being property”The statement noted that smart contracts can “create more secure and more efficient ways of implementing — and automating the performance of — contracts between parties,” adding that there is potential in cryptoasset systems to revolutionize agreements with smart contracts, such as mortgages, medical research and property ownershipInstead of referring them to as “digital assets,” Sir Geoffrey refers to cryptocurrencies and blockchain tokens as cryptoassets because cryptoassets “directs attention to assets that are recorded on a distributed ledger, and stops short of electronic data and intellectual property”Head of Blockchain and Cryptoassets at law firm Eversheds Sutherland James Burnie <a href="https://www.eversheds-sutherland.com/global/en/what/articles/index.page?ArticleID=en/Financial_services/ukjt-crypto-181119">commented</a>, “Perhaps the most welcome aspect of the report is as regards the recognition that a private key can be a signature. This reflects the reality of modern-day interactions, where it is not practical to, for example, suggest that documents need a wet ink signature to be validly signed. Indeed, given the weaknesses of the traditional signature in terms of fraudulent copying, a private key that is only under one individual’s control could be better in terms of providing evidence of an actual agreement”</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-stability-idUSKBN1XP249"><b>Reuters: Fed Says U.S. Financial System Resilient; Flags Low Rates, ‘Stablecoin’ as Risks</b></a>In its latest <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20191115.pdf">bi-yearly review of financial stability</a>, the U.S. Fed flagged high levels of corporate debt, the impact of an extended period of low global interest rates, and emerging stablecoin proposals as potential risks to the financial systemOverall financial stability conditions are little changed since its last report in May and “the core of the financial sector appears resilient”While commercial real estate asset values are high, “risk appetite” is in line with “historical norms,” household debt is “at a modest level relative to income,” leverage levels are low among the largest banks, and the use of potentially volatile short-term funding pose only a modest risk to financial institutionsThe report highlighted record-high levels of corporate debt, which some officials worry could go bad if business slows and worsen any economic downturn, adding that that low global borrowing costs could over time erode bank, insurance company, and pension fund returns, prompting them to take more risksFed Governor Lael Brainard said, “The current combination of very low credit spreads and high levels of indebtedness among risky nonfinancial corporates, including through leveraged loans, merits heightened vigilance. Over the medium term, the low-for-long environment and the associated incentives to reach for yield and take on additional debt could increase financial vulnerabilities”The report warned that while stablecoins and other innovative FinTech products could serve as a new medium of exchange, the financial system could face “potentially severe consequences” if a broad-based stablecoin is poorly designed or regulated, “The possibility for a stablecoin payment network to quickly achieve global scale introduces important challenges and risks related to financial stability, monetary policy, safeguards against money laundering and terrorist financing, and consumer and investor protection”The Fed contends that stablecoins must meet AML/CFT rules, issuers should fully disclose the terms of their services, should be transparent on how a stablecoin is tied to an underlying asset, and holders’ data privacy must be appropriately maintainedIn a Fed survey of investors and gov’t contacts, “trade frictions” were cited as the chief economic risk, followed by concerns that looser monetary policy could lead to “excessive risk-taking”Business credit has continued to grow faster than the economy, debt is high relative to both the size of the U.S. economy and the size of corporate balance sheets, and the fastest increases have been in “debt extended to firms with poorer credit profiles”; the Fed concluded that low borrowing costs have made that debt more sustainable, “Broader corporate credit performance remains favorable amid a strong economy, and, with interest rates low by historical standards, debt service costs are at the lower ends of their historical ranges, particularly for risky firms”</li>

This was done without the knowledge of <a href="http://alibaba.com/">Alibaba.com</a>. Alibaba.com’s contractor is terminating the relationship with the subcontractor who was working with Lolli. As a result, Lolli should no longer promote or bring traffic to Alibaba.com”Lolli wasn’t completely off-base since there were contractual agreements that appeared to permit the usage of “Alibaba related keywords” in online materials; the startup had already been processing BTC rewards for <a href="https://twitter.com/quiltedjeans/status/1157681723724967936">AliExpress shoppers</a> since May, had finalized paperwork, and even processed payments before the now-controversial announcementAn Alibaba spokesperson said that while Lolli saw this as an official partnership, Alibaba viewed it as a private and “transactional” deal mediated by third partiesDespite the rewards processed, the spokesperson claimed there was no direct contact between Lolli and Alibaba Group and claimed that Alibaba Group doesn’t work with BTC-related companies Lolli’s Head of Communications Aubrey Strobel said Alibaba.com trialed Lolli’s services for 24hrs during the campaign, then deactivated “the partnership” after publicity drew attention to the trial, “It seems as though there was a miscommunication on Alibaba’s end and while that’s unfortunate, we look forward to the possibility of working with Alibaba.com again in the future.
