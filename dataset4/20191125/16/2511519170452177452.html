      <p>A stray <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Dogs">dog</a> has been discovered by the side of a road keeping a litter of abandoned <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/kittens">kittens</a> warm. </p>
      <p>The caring pooch was found guarding the five baby cats by the side of a road in Ontario, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Canada">Canada</a>, last week.</p>
      <p>It is not known whether the kittens were dumped by their owner or abandoned by a feral mother cat.</p>
      <p>Pet and Wildlife Rescue shared the heartwarming story in a bid to find a forever home for the protective pup, which has since been named Serenity.</p>
      <p>According to the staff, a “good citizen” called the animal shelter to alert them of the situation, prompting an animal control officer to collect the animals who have been “living [their] best lives since!”</p>
      <p>The story was picked up by media and adoption requests for Serenity have been flooding in.</p>
      <p>In a post shared by the shelter, the heroic pooch is described as approximately two years old with “the energy of a toddler” and good with cats.</p>
      <p>Despite her protective nature, Serenity can be quite jumpy and needs help with house training and “to be taught some manners”.</p>
      <p>While the shelter staff have said that they would like to rehome Serenity and the kittens together, they are unable to do so as this would involve a wait of several months for the dog.</p>
      <p>The shelter’s goal is to get animals out of the shelter environment and into their forever home as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>The kittens are currently being cared for in “a warm foster home”. Once they are old enough, they will also be rehomed. </p>
      <p>Responses to the touching story have been flooding in from around the globe, with social media users commenting on Serenity’s caring behaviour.</p>
      <p>“Sweet girl!”, wrote Amanda. “Animals are so much better than humans”. </p>
      <p>This makes me cry both happy and sad tears,” wrote Amanda. “Thank you for all that you do.”</p>
      <p>Black cats often taken longer to be adopted because of their association with witches. </p>
      <p>More recent reports have claimed that they’re not as photogenic for social media posts. </p>
      <p>The popularity of these five kittens suggests that they won’t be without a forever home for long, however.</p>
