      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/angelina-jolie/">Angelina Jolie</a> is recently off the promo trail for her blockbuster movie Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.</p>
      <p>So it’s great to see her enjoying some down time with her gorgeous daughter Vivienne!</p>
      <p>The star’s youngest child – whose dad is of course fellow movie star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brad-pitt/">Brad Pitt</a> – joined her mother for a shopping trip in LA yesterday. It looks like Christmas shopping has already started.</p>
      <p>And we’re just going to put it out there: she really is the spitting image of her famous father, isn’t she?</p>
      <p>It’s actually uncanny!</p>
      <p>Angelina and Brad are also parents to Shiloh, Maddox, Zahara, Pax and Knox.</p>
      <p>While Vivienne is one of the youngest of the brood at 11, Maddox, who is 18, is the oldest.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile Knox is now also 11 (he’s Vivienne’s twin, FYI), Zahara is 14, Shiloh is 13 and Pax is 15.</p>

      <p>Where do the years go?! It seems like only yesterday the twins arrived!</p>

      <p>Angie – who will also star in the 2020 comic book movie The Eternals – is of course now a single parent after her divorce from Ad Astra actor Brad in 2016.</p>
      <p>The star recently opened up about her relationship with her kids following her separation from Brad in an interview with <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29644077/angelina-jolie-interview-2019/">Harper’s Bazaar</a> earlier this month.</p>

      <p>She told the publication: ‘My children know my true self and they have helped me to find it again and to embrace it.’</p>
      <p>‘They have been through a lot,’ she went on. ‘I learn from their strength.</p>
      <p>‘As parents, we encourage our kids to embrace all that they are, and all that they know in their hearts to be right, and they look back at us and want the same for us.’</p>
      <p>Wise words!</p>
