      <h1>Cardiff City Under-23s boss Andy Legg leaves club as part of academy shake-up</h1>
      <h2>A temporary replacement has been named</h2>

      <p>Andy Legg has left his post as Cardiff City’s under-23s manager as part of an internal restructure, WalesOnline has learned.</p>
      <p>It is understood that Legg’s departure is not a straight directive from new first-team boss Neil Harris but is a decision made by the club’s top brass.</p>
      <p>Sources at the club have stressed that they are grateful for the brilliant job Legg did as under-23s boss and his departure is simply a byproduct of a decision to take the academy in a different direction.</p>
      <p>His exit is also not by virtue of any disciplinary measures, either.</p>
      <p>It is also thought this structure shake-up has been in the works for some time, before Harris’s appointment in fact, and was not a case of the new manager looking to overhaul the youth set-up immediately.</p>
      <p>Former Norwich City, Bristol Rovers and Wales under-21s midfielder Tom Ramasut takes over from Legg on a temporary basis as the club seek a permanent appointment.</p>
      <p>Ramasut, 42, has coached at the academy for eight years and was in charge of today’s 0-0 draw with Charlton Athletic at Leckwith in Legg’s absence.</p>
      <p>Legg’s departure is the second high-profile exit from the club’s academy in a matter of months, with Craig Bellamy having left South Wales to join Anderlecht’s youth setup this summer.</p>
