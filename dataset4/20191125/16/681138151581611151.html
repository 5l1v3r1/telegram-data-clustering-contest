        <b>Worried bank staff across branches in Suffolk and north Essex are bracing themselves for bad news after TSB announced plans to shut sites across the UK.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Up to 400 jobs could go with the closure of 82 branches next year as the bank prunes back its <b>550-strong network.</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>TSB is set to make a further announcement on Thursday, November 28, but job losses are likely to come from smaller and quieter high street branches.</b>
      </p>

          <b>Do you really remember what Ipswich high street looked like 10 years ago?<br/></b>

        <b>"There's nothing we can say about locations at the moment because we are talking to all our staff that could be affected," a spokeswoman said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>TSB - which employs an average of around four to five staff at each bank - has branches in towns across Suffolk and north Essex, including Ipswich Buttermarket, Stowmarket, Hadleigh, Bury St Edmunds, Colchester, Great Dunmow and Bishop's Stortford.</p>
      <p>TSB said it would try to find new jobs for affected staff elsewhere in the group.</p>
      <p>The closures are part of a plan to save around £100m by 2022, and turn a profit of between £130m and £140m, TSB boss Debbie Crosbie said as she set out her three-year plan for the business.</p>
      <p>"The plan we're sharing today involves some difficult decisions, but it sets TSB up to succeed in the future," she said.</p>
      <p>"Taken together, these changes will help us to serve more customers, better, for the long-term."</p>
      <p>The proposals also include a push to invest another £120m in digital products, as the bank says it expects 70% to 80% of its sales to come from digital channels by 2022, up from 46% in September this year.</p>
      <p>The announcement comes during a tough retail environment for British banks, with high streets suffering while online-only challengers are luring customers awary with new types of accounts.</p>
      <p>TSB had around twice the number of stores per 10,000 customers in 2018 as the average in the UK, the bank said.</p>
      <p>"With a trusted brand, modern platform, and national presence, TSB is well placed to deliver - but we need to make changes to enable us to compete," Ms Crosbie said.</p>
      <p>"Our new strategy positions TSB to succeed in a challenging external environment at a time when we know customers want something different and better from their bank."</p>
