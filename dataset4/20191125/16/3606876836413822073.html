      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYIAu847HiE">Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn </a>should probably watch their backs, because there's a new pair of Wedding Crashers that have started to hit the town: <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a27960800/the-rock-dick-towel/">The Rock </a>and Danny DeVito. The pair, who both star in the upcoming Jumanji sequel, The Next Level, were at the end of of a press junket day for the film in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, and overheard a wedding nearby, and decided to drop in, say hello, and sing a song.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29811699/danny-devito-kaitlin-olson-always-sunny-holiday-party/">Always Sunny </a><a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29811699/danny-devito-kaitlin-olson-always-sunny-holiday-party/"> star </a>and the <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/g22593657/dwayne-johnson-the-rock-movies-list/">wrestler-turned-action icon </a>both really look like they're having a blast in the clip, and The Rock even said he's never crashed a wedding beforewhich is wild, because any wedding would obviously be better with The Rock at it.</p>
      <p>The pair entered the wedding reception through the kitchen, surprising the guests and newlyweds as they walked in singing "Unforgettable" by Nat King Cole, with both stars making the song definitively their own (Danny DeVito's singing style is unmistakable, of course).</p>
      <p>The Rock posted a video of the whole thing to both his Instagram stories, and also a clip on his actual IG feed. He captioned it with the below note:</p>
      <p>"Ive never crashed a wedding, but with Devito this was truly UNFORGETTABLE. We were sippin on a lil Teremana tequila enjoyin the quiet sunset together in Mexico after a long week of Jumanji work when this idea hit. Crash the wedding. Grab a mic. Sing a special song. Say adios. It was actually quite beautiful and the love and mana in that room surrounding the wedding couple was so strong. Congratulations to the lovey bride, Kristine and handsome groom, Will. And their four children, Ryan, Mason, Edie &amp; Max. Beautiful family. The Abbots aka Brady Bunch. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/unforgettable/">#unforgettable </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/cabosanlucas/"> #cabosanlucas </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/rockdevitoweddingcrash/"> #rockdevitoweddingcrash </a>"</p>
