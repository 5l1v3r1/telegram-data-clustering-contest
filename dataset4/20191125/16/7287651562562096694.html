      <p>Corsair today announced a range of products including liquid CPU coolers, high-frequency DRAM, and efficient power supplies fully tested and validated for compatibility with the new 3rd Generation AMD Ryzen Threadripper high-end desktop processors. With the highest core and thread count on the HEDT market, combined with the lightning-fast PCI-Express 4.0 platform, AMD’s most powerful desktop processor can create, composite, render, encode, and deliver with unprecedented multitasking power – and Corsair is ready with the widest range of guaranteed-compatible products to help get the best performance out of a new Ryzen Threadripper-based PC.<br/><br/>3rd Gen Threadripper processors, combined with a TRX chipset-based motherboard, enable blazing fast speeds from the world’s first HEDT PCI-Express 4.0 platform. The Corsair Force MP600 NVMe M.2 SSD takes advantage of the increased PCIe 4.0 bandwidth with sequential read speeds of up to 4,950MB/s and sequential write speeds of up to 4,250MB/s – ten times faster than most SATA SSDs<br/><br/>Threadripper’s impressive clock speeds make a perfect fit with high-frequency Corsair DDR4 memory such as DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB, VENGEANCE RGB PRO, and VENGEANCE LPX. Available in kits of up to eight modules, in a range of clock speeds up to and exceeding 4,000MHz, Corsair memory provides guaranteed quad-channel performance and the style to match.<br/><br/>The massive performance potential of Threadripper means the processor also generates large amounts of heat – up to 280W. A high-performance CPU cooler is vital to ensure that your CPU runs consistently at top speeds. Corsair offers a wide variety of all-in-one liquid CPU coolers that are out-of-the-box compatible with Threadripper’s sTRX4 socket, such as the Hydro Series RGB PLATINUM, in radiator sizes from 240mm to 360mm, to keep those temperatures down and boost frequencies up.<br/><br/>With their massive number of cores, Threadripper CPUs have high power demands, and users need to ensure their PSU is up to the challenge. Corsair offers an industry-leading range of efficient and reliable power supplies, from 80 PLUS Gold Certified PSUs, such as the RM Series, to the ultra-efficient 80 PLUS Titanium powerhouse AX1600i.<br/><br/>For those looking to build the ultimate Threadripper system, trust Corsair for the quality components to support the world’s most powerful desktop processor.</p>
