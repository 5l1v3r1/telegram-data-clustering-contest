      <p>Role Playing Games (RPGs) and simulations (SIMs) are some of the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/features/94458/the-most-niche-simulation-pc-games-we-could-find">most engaging types of games </a>because they place players in various immersive situations. Participants can succeed or fail at their quests depending on how they respond to situations and challenges. They can also learn from their mistakes and increase their experience the more they play. This type of game logic is now being integrated with various technologies to benefit healthcare providers and patients by helping them better engage in potentially life-saving conversations.</p>
      <p><a href="https://kognito.com/">Kognito </a>is a health simulation company that designs scenarios and virtual human training solutions that hone conversational skills to improve patient interactions. Their scenarios help patients navigate possible treatments by conversing with an avatar called a virtual human.</p>
      <p>"We started around 10 years ago and have around 90 employees composed of instructional designers, writers, behavioral psychologists, and software engineers," said Ron Goldman, Co-founder and CEO of Kognito. "We're not trying to be the Google or WebMD for healthcare training, we apply technology and game logic to create simulations. We track and analyze decisions people make, as well as user feedback to help us get better."</p>

      <p>Kognito has engaged more than one million users and currently has three key applications. Patient Screening and Intake, Coaching, and Role-Play Conversations. By creating a library of scenarios based on game logic and the science of human emotions, Kognito's simulations can train users to say the right words at the right time.</p>
      <p>Similar to other <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/cloud-services/82258/the-best-online-learning-platforms-for-business">online corporate training</a> services, scenarios unfold in on screen role-play conversations with virtual humans, which are avatars that serve as practice patients. Users can assume various roles ranging from teachers that are talking to students showing signs of psychological distress, or healthcare providers discussing delicate medical issues with patients.</p>
      <p>While the advantages of simulation-based training are evident for healthcare, it's easy to see how they could also be applied across other business disciplines, such as <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/cloud-services/67398/the-best-crm-software">customer relationship management (CRM)</a>, <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/cloud-services/70330/the-best-helpdesk-software">help desk </a>solutions, and <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/cloud-services/75068/the-best-hr-software">human resources (HR)</a>.</p>

      <h3>Linda, The Virtual Human as a Coach</h3>
      <p>If you want to try an example of Kognito's approach, there's Linda. This is a virtual coach in the <a href="https://simulations.kognito.com/tnbc/">Talk to Someone: Triple Negative Breast Cancer</a> webpage and app that's designed to help patients understand various treatment options. The Linda agent (see image above), appears as a virtual avatar in an outdoor park setting. "She is a fully articulated and emotionally responsive virtual human and speaks to the real-life experience of a survivor, and tailors her messages to each user's knowledge level, concerns, and overall motivation," Goldman explaned. The simulation is publicly available and funded by the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/news/93762/how-virtual-avatars-help-stroke-patients-improve-motor-funct">Virtual Avatars like Linda</a> have been used in various types of medical simulations.</p>
      <p>Designed to respond to user's queries, navigating a conversation with Linda is similar to many turn-based role playing games except in this case, the focus is on informing patients on the most viable treatment options for Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) diagnosis.</p>
      <p>"Linda assists patients posing their questions about TNBC, chemotherapy, life during treatment, and survivorship," Goldman said. As a coach, Linda helps patients who may have otherwise opted not to consider chemotherapy, understand the pros and cons of treatment.</p>
      <p>During their conversation with Linda, users are asked the following two questions at the beginning and again at the end of the simulation. The first is, "Do you have enough information to make a treatment decision?" and the second is "Are you Planning to Pursue Chemotherapy?"</p>
      <p>"Preliminary data collected from users show that for the first question, 50 percent of those who initially reported not having enough info to make a treatment decision reported at the end of the sim that they now do; and for the second question, there was a 38 percent increase in women who said that they would definitely pursue chemotherapy after completing the simulation," Goldman said. Virtual avatars like Linda are ideal for patients who want to explore treatment options on their own time or without the pressure of discussing their diagnosis with a doctor or healthcare provider.</p>
      <p>For healthcare professionals that do need to engage patients, Kognito's simulation and role-playing exercises can improve their skills and ensure they are interacting with patients in a knowledgeable and empathic manner.</p>

      <h3>Better Training Through Simulated Conversations</h3>
      <p>Healthcare professionals speaking to patients about sensitive medical situations have to be knowledgeable and reassuring, they also have to be able to communicate properly. "As with many sensitive interactions, how someone says something is just as important as what they are saying. Considering gestures, non-verbal cues, and mannerisms all weigh heavily in these interactions," Goldman said.</p>
      <p>Kognito's various simulations help train users by simulating conversations and varied responses. In the <a href="https://conversationsforhealth.com/antibiotics/">Primary Care Office Visit: Antibiotics</a> - Simulation, participants are trained on effectively discussing the appropriate use of antibiotics between healthcare providers and patients. The simulation (see image above) provides hands-on practice applying motivational interviewing to improve patient outcomes. "Users choose between playing the provider or patient in the clinical case," Goldman explained. The simulation is publicly available and funded by the <a href="https://www.rwjf.org/">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</a>.</p>
      <p>The Primary Care Office Visit: Antibiotics simulation allows participants to take the role of a coughing patient or the doctor. Each question brings the conversation to another step in learning about symptoms as well as whether antibiotics can help based on the patient's symptoms. Aside from the conversation between the virtual avatars, a coach widget at the bottom offers useful tips and hints. Running through the role-play simulation as a patient and as a doctor will help train healthcare professionals to better understand topics from both sides.</p>
      <p>"The more we can mimic real life in our sims, then the better the experience will be," Goldman said. Looking at technology that can help Kognito create more immersive experiences for their users, he singled out <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/48005/nlp">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</a> and <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/consumer-electronics-reviews-ratings/86123/feature/augmented-reality-ar-vs-virtual-reality-vr-whats-the-differe">augmented reality (AR)</a> as emerging technologies worth looking out for. NLP, which is a sub field of <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/news/120759/what-is-artificial-intelligence-ai">artificial intelligence (AI) </a>is one area that Goldman believes can one day improve training by being able to accurately track voice tone and analyze human emotions. "I think natural language processing that can understand intonation will be a significant breakthrough, but we're not there yet," said Goldman.</p>
