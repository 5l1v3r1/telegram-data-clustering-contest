        <b>Q: Wycombe scored in stoppage-time today. That puts them five points clear...</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: It's a disaster isn't it!? An absolute unbelievable disaster! Honestly!</p>
      <p>I think we've played, what, 45 games and have one game leftâ€¦ It's a disaster!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: It feels like a big game...</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: Honestly, it's a disaster! We've played 17 games, yeah? Maybe we can lose the title this month. Can we lose it? Can we lose the title this month?</p>
      <p>Maybe not. Let's see what happens in May. We've got two games in hand and we're a good side. Make no mistake about it, we're a good side.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: It's first versus second...</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: Yeah, and it's November. You get absolutely nothing in November. We are a right good side.</p>
      <p>We've lost a couple of games all season... Let's see what happens.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: Are you surprised Wycombe are up there?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: Do you know what, I don't know. I'm only concentrating on us. They've had a great start and I'm pretty sure if you asked Gareth (Ainsworth) he'd be saying the same.</p>
      <p>Let's see what happens. You get nothing in November.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: Wycombe is where you started your managerial career in England of course...</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: It was a really good little club at that time. We got into the (League Two) play-offs and (League Cup) semi-final, which was great.</p>
      <p>I had some good guys there, some really good players. It's a good little club.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: Do you still speak to anyone there?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: Alan Parry I still speak to. AP is still there. The only thing wrong with him is he's a Rangers fan! Matty Bloomfield played under me.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: And Matty's coaching a couple of nights at Ipswich isn't he (with the Under-18s)?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: I think so, yeah. I've only seen him once or twice.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: So will you ban him from Playford Road this week, just to stop your plans for the game getting out!</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: If I see him I'll tell him 'well done you've won the league in November because the Ipswich newspaper says so'.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: So you're saying this game shouldn't be hyped up at all?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: No, it's just another game. We live with pressure every day, this football club lives with pressure every day. That won't change, long after I'm away.</p>
      <p>Nearly 20,000 here again is unbelievable. The atmosphere inside the stadium is unbelievable. The club's going the right way.</p>
