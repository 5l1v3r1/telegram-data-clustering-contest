      <h1>EUR/GBP extends losses under 0.8550, eyes November's low</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:30:49+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/matias-salord" target="_blank">Matías Salord</a></address>

          <b>The pound remains strong on the back of the latest polls and risk sentiment. </b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Euro under pressure with EUR/USD back near 1.1000. </b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The EUR/GBP dropped further below 0.8550 and reached a fresh one-week low at 0.8530, slightly above the November low at 0.8520. A break below would put the pair at its weakens level since May. </p>
      <p>A stronger pound across the board is the key driver today. While GBP/USD trades on top of 1.2900 at daily highs, EUR/USD is consolidating losses, unable to rebound from 1.1000. </p>
      <h3>Politics driving the pound higher... for now </h3>
      <p>The improvement in <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">market sentiment</a> and the latest polls ahead of the general election in the United Kingdom offered support to <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd">the pound</a> at the beginning of the week. It is higher across the board, erasing Friday’s losses. </p>
      <p>Over the weekend, polls show the Conservative Party leading with around 40/44% of the vote intention, while the Labour Party around 30%. Expectations of an important victory for the conservatives would be seen as a probable end to the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/events/brexit">Brexit</a> drama. In the manifest, UK Prime Minister Johnson's party mentioned they would look for a deal back to the Parliament before Christmas. On the contrary, <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">the euro</a> remained weak following November’s IFO survey. The index bounced but market consensus pointed to a higher number. </p>
      <p>From a technical perspective,<b> EUR/GBP holds a bearish tone.</b> A break below 0.8520w would expose 0.8500 and then attention would turn to 0.8470. On the upside, a daily close on top of 0.8595/0.8600 (horizontal <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> and 20-day moving average) would remove the bearish bias signaling further gains ahead. </p>
