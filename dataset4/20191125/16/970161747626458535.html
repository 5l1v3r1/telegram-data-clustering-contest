      <p>A man who lost 20 stone in 12 months is enjoying a new lease of life, after getting an ‘amazing’ girlfriend.</p>
      <p>Darren ‘Dibsy’ McClintock lost half of his entire body mass after embarking on a weight loss journey last year.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old’s no-nonsense personal trainer banned Dibsy from local takeaways, in a bid to turn his life around after doctors warned he was ‘eating himself to death’.</p>
      <p>He has now revealed he’s in a relationship with a trainee nurse called Jade, 28, who got in touch with him after following his progress online.</p>
      <p>The pair exchanged messages over Facebook before going on their first date, at a bowling alley, in August and becoming an ‘official’ couple a month later.</p>
      <p>Dibsy said: ‘Jade is such an amazing girl. She’s so caring and is really supportive of my weight loss and what I’m doing.</p>

      <p>‘It’s great to have someone like that in my life – 18 months ago I wouldn’t have thought it was possible.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘I’m definitely punching above my weight.’</p>
      <p>Dibsy said Jade, who’s also from Middlesbrough, first messaged him over Facebook last October, right at the start of his weight loss journey, to say good luck.</p>
      <p>‘It was nice to get the message and I replied saying thank you but I didn’t think much else of it,’ he said.</p>

      <p>Jade reached out for a second time in July, when Dibsy conquered Ben Nevis alongside personal trainer Mike Hind for charity.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘After Jade messaged me again we started chatting properly and got on really well so exchanged numbers.’</p>
      <p>Within a few days the pair arranged to meet face-to-face and they went for a walk at a nearby beauty spot, which coincidentally is where Dibsy spread his dad’s ashes.</p>
      <p>‘When she said she wanted to go there I knew it was meant to be,’ he said.</p>
      <p>Their first proper date was at a bowling alley in August and just over a month later the pair made their relationship ‘official’.</p>
      <p>Dibsy said he was able to get on so well with Jade in the early stages because of a renewed self-confidence which has come about as a result of the weight loss.</p>
      <p>‘My mindset now is completely different to how it was 18 months ago,’ he explained.</p>
      <p>‘Before I wouldn’t have tried anything new because I was scared about what people would think of me.</p>

      <p>‘But now I feel comfortable in my own skin and like I can just be myself, it’s an incredible turnaround.</p>
      <p>‘I’m really happy now.’</p>
      <p>Much of the Middlesborough man’s astounding success is down to personal trainer Mike Hind, who has been with Dibsy every step of the way.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘When Dibsy and I first started working together I asked him what he wanted to achieve.</p>
      <p>‘He told me he wanted to a girl to settle down with, just like all his friends have.</p>
      <p>‘To see him achieve that now after putting so much work in is incredible, I’m so happy for him.</p>
      <p>‘Dibsy and Jade make a great couple.</p>
      <p>‘It just goes to show what eating well and keeping fit can do for you, it’s completely turned his life around.’</p>

      <p>Dibsy suffered a setback last month when an irregular heartbeat, which he had dealt with previously, returned and sidelined him from the gym.</p>
      <p>He underwent an operation to fix the problem last week and, miraculously, he is already back on the treadmill continuing his weight loss journey.</p>
      <p>Dibsy now has his sights set on the new year, when he plans to have three surgeries to remove excess skin which has been left as a result of the weight loss.</p>

      <p>Dibsy added: ‘It’s onward and upward from here.’</p>
