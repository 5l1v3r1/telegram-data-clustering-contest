      <p>YSR Congress seems to be desperate to see Chandrababu Naidu behind the bars. They have now brought Cash for Vote case once again into the limelight. YSR Congress Controversial MLA, <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/politics/alla-ramakrishna-reddy-silly-explanation-behind-amaravati-works-getting-stalled/">Alla Ramakrishna Reddy</a> approached a petition in Supreme Court seeking an early hearing in Cash for Vote case of May 2015.</p>
      <p>Revanth Reddy, who is now an MP from Congress was arrested on a charge of offering Rs 50 Lakh to nominated MLC Elvis Stephenson to vote for the <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/politics/will-an-alliance-between-tdp-and-bjp-help-jagan/">TDP</a> candidate in Telangana MLC polls. A call record was also surfaced with a voice similar to Chandrababu assuring all that is promised to Stephenson.</p>
      <p>However, the case did not progress after the initial Hungama. On the other side, the ACB court also agreed to revive a 2005 disproportionate assets case on Chandrababu Naidu filed by Lakshmi Parvathi who is now a YSR Congress Leader.</p>
      <p>YSR Congress is hopeful that Chandrababu Naidu will go behind the bars in at least one of these cases.</p>
