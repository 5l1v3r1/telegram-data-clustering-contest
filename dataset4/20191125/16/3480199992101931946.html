      <p>Stormzy tops the bill of a list of musicians, artists, rappers and grime MCs who are backing Jeremy Corbyn and Labour at the General Election.</p>
      <p>Rappers Akala, Kano and Professor Green and singers Katy B and Peter Hooton of Liverpool group The Farm are among the 39 artists signing the letter, alongside the Grime 4 Corbyn campaign group.</p>
      <p>Brit Awards winner Stormzy backed Labour in 2017 and has been a vocal critic of the Conservative government.</p>
      <p>At the Brit Awards ceremony in 2018 he said: “Theresa May, where’s the money for Grenfell?” and at the Glastonbury music festival this year he led chants of “F*** Boris”.</p>

      <p>Grime MC Wiley also tweeted his support of Mr Corbyn earlier in the month where he said: “Big up @jeremycorbyn” to which the Labour leader replied “Thank you Wiley”.</p>
      <p>The letter to the Guardian newspaper reads: “We’re not voting Labour in the naive hope that they will solve all the problems our communities face.</p>
      <p>“We vote because they offer an urgent alternative to the destructive policies of the Conservatives.”</p>
      <p>It continues: “We are under no illusions about Labour’s own imperial history, and we don’t think the British establishment is fundamentally going to change.</p>
      <p>“But we are sick of our taxes being spent on fighting more wars and building more jails.</p>
      <p>“Jeremy Corbyn has been one of the few people who has fought against injustice all his political life, from apartheid South Africa to the bombing of Libya.</p>

      <p>“To deny from our own, now quite comfortable places, that a Labour government would improve the lives of millions would betray the communities we come from.</p>
      <p>“The opportunity for people-led change can be made possible under a Jeremy Corbyn Labour government.</p>
      <p>“End austerity, rebuild our communities and take back the means to change our lives for the better.</p>
      <p>“Surely, in an election that could transform the livelihoods of many, and be the difference between life or death for many more, life is something worth voting for.”</p>
