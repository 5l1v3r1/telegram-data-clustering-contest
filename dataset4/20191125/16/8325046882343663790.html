      <p>Thieves in the Germany city of Dresden carried out what authorities believe may be the biggest art heist in the country since the Second World War, stealing around 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) worth of jewels from a</p>
      <p>The heist, which local police said appears to have been carefully planned and executed, was carried out early Monday morning. Thieves stole the jewels from the so-called “Green Vault,” an area within Dresden’s Residenzschloss palace.</p>
      <p>Security teams at the museum picked up footage of the perpetrators cutting through a metal grill and breaking a window into the vault, according to German newspaper <a href="https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article203803770/Gruenes-Gewoelbe-Dresden-Was-wir-ueber-den-Raub-die-Beute-die-Flucht-wissen.html">Die Welt.</a></p>
      <p>Two people were spotted in the surveillance footage, but police are not ruling out the possibility of a larger team being involved, according to Die Welt.</p>

      <p>Police said at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZKSI-hJvZc">a press conference in Dresden</a> on Monday afternoon that a small fire was also started in a nearby square that led to an electricity box catching fire – plunging the entire area into a blackout.</p>

      <p>The blackout meant that all the street lamps and CCTV cameras surrounding the Museum failed, lending a huge advantage to the thieves.</p>
      <p>It is not yet clear whether this fire was started by the thieves, but police are treating the incident as being connected to the theft.</p>

      <p>Police also said there was also a car on a nearby road that was on fire, which they believe may be connected to the heist.</p>
      <p>Three diamond jewelry sets were stolen by the intruders, according to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-50545003">the BBC.</a></p>
      <p>The collection targeted by the thieves was founded in the 18th-century and is of huge importance to the history and culture of the people of Saxony, the German state in which the museum is located.</p>
      <p>“This is a bitter day for the cultural heritage of Saxony,” Roland Wöller, the interior minister for the Saxony region said, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/25/thieves-steal-priceless-treasures-dresden-green-vault-museum">according to the Guardian newspaper.</a></p>
      <p>“The thieves stole cultural treasures of immeasurable worth – that is not only the material worth but also the intangible worth to the state of Saxony, which is impossible to estimate.”</p>

      <p>The total value of the items stolen is estimated to be over €1 billion, but the head of the Dresden state museums Maroin Ackermann described the jewels as “priceless – we can’t put a figure on it,” according to the BBC.</p>
      <p>Ackermann added that the items will be impossible to sell legally because of the widespread attention the theft has garnered.</p>
      <p>Items in the collection include a sculpture known as “Moor with Emerald Cluster,” and a coffee service set made entirely of gold.</p>
