      <p>Court documents that surfaced recently noted Lauryn Hill has taken her cousin to court over a reportedly $70,000 he owes.</p>
      <p>Lauryn Hill filed the lawsuit against her cousin Gerald Hill in June 2018, noting she loaned him $65,000 in June 2017, which was documented by a written contract signed by both parties. The deal indicated that if Gerald repaid the loan by September 2017, he would not have to pay any interest. However, if the loan was paid after September, he would be charged 10% interest until the loan was paid back.</p>
      <p>Since then, Hill has been granted a default judgment by a judge in August 2019, awarding her $72,886.62. However, Hill has hit her cousin with subpoenas about his income, which Gerald Hill has reportedly failed to comply with. Stay tuned for more details in this case.</p>
