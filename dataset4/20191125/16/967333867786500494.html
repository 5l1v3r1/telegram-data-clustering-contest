      <p>Singer and actress Goo Hara, former member of the prominent South Korean girl group Kara, apparently left a note prior to her death, the Daily Mail reports.</p>
      <p>News of this development comes after the 28-year old K-pop star was <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911241077388525-k-pop-star-goo-hara-found-dead-at-her-home---police/">found dead</a> at her home in Seoul on 25 November.</p>
      <blockquote>"A handwritten note that was pessimistic about her life was found on a living room table," Lee Yong-pyo, commissioner of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, said as quoted by the newspaper.</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier this year, Goo Hara ended up being hospitalised after a suspected suicide attempt, apologising to her fans and saying that she had been "in agony over a number of issues."</p>
      <blockquote>At the time, the singer was involved in a legal row with her ex-boyfriend who allegedly blackmailed her with their sex videos and threatened "to end her entertainment career" by revealing the vids to the public.</blockquote>
      <p>Following <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201911251077392437-goo-hara-joins-a-disturbing-list-of-k-pop-deaths-whats-behind-them/">Goo Hara’s death</a>, an online petition calling for tougher punishments for cybercrimes and abusive online comments, to be submitted to the presidential palace, accrued over 20,000 signatures less than a day after its creation.</p>
      <blockquote>"It was not long ago that we lost someone through hate comments and this cannot happen again. Please protect the people from hate comments and criticisms that are spreading like a virus," the petition said.</blockquote>
