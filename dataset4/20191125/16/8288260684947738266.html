      <h2>Aston Villa v Newcastle | The Magpies make the long trip to the Midlands to face Villa, looking to continue their positive start under Steve Bruce</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:27:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:27</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle United fans have been having their say ahead of the pivotal looking clash with Aston Villa tonight.</p>
      <p>The Magpies make the trip to B6 in good form - winning the last two before the international break.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> meanwhile lost three on the spin before the 15 day break, with defeat at Wolves labelled as one of the worst under Dean Smith.</p>

      <p>Newcastle come into the game in 13th place, with 15 points from their opening dozen games, four points ahead of Villa.</p>
      <p>With a tricky looking run of fixtures for Smith's side on the horizon, Villa will be desperate to earn three points in front of the Sky Sports cameras.</p>
      <p>It will also be Steve Bruce's Villa Park return, the Newcastle United boss hasn't been in a dugout on B6 since his unceremonious sacking from the club in 2018.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the game, we've taken a look on social media and on fan forums, to get a taste of how the away end are feeling:</p>

      <p><b>Ben 10:</b> They were poor against Wolves, we've won our last 2 so should really be beating them. Nailed on home win</p>
      <p><b>Southerner:</b> I'm going for the front three making up for their profligacy all at once with a 12-0 victory. Up to 6th in the table and dreams of Europe!</p>
      <p><b>@JBDT:</b> Villa are poor without Grealish, let’s hope he’s still out of action when we meet at Villa Park</p>
      <p><b>@ToonHeed77:</b> I've often looked at Aston Villa like a Boro in terms of size and stature, yet because they won trophies in the 1890s they're big. I truly believe if we get a result on Monday they're away where they belong again at the end of the season</p>
      <p><b>Ewerk:</b> 2-1 away victory and Steve Bruce to be handed the freedom of the city.</p>
      <p><b>@NUFC3000:</b> I reckon we’ll do villa.</p>
      <p><b>@LewisWill33:</b> they're one of those teams that are tough to beat. I reckon we'll either win 3-2 or it'll be a boring 1-0 to them</p>
