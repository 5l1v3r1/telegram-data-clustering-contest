      <h1>Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker Director on Why Palpatine Returns</h1>

      <p>Director/co-writer J.J. Abrams' decision to bring back <a href="https://www.cbr.com/rise-of-skywalker-director-no-plans-palpatine/">Darth Sidious/Emperor Palpatine</a> in <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-episode-ix/">Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</a></i> was met with skepticism by some. For Abrams, though, it seemed like the logical way to conclude the Skywalker Saga.</p>
      <p>"Well, when you look at this as nine chapters of a story, perhaps the weirder thing would be if <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-rise-skywalker-emperor-palpatine-role-return/amp/">Palpatine <i>didn’t</i> return</a>," Abrams told <a href="https://uproxx.com/movies/jj-abrams-interview-the-rise-of-skywalker-star-wars/2/">Uproxx</a>. "You just look at what he talks about, who he is, how important he is, what the story is — strangely, his absence entirely from the third trilogy would be conspicuous. It would be very weird."</p>

      <p>"That’s not to say there was a bible and we knew what happens at every step. But when Larry Kasdan and I worked on <i>The Force Awakens</i>, we didn’t do it in a vacuum," he continued. "We very purposely looked at what came before. We chose to tell a story that touches upon specific things and themes and ideas that we’ve seen before, to begin a new story. But we examined all that came before to ask where does this feel like it’s going?"</p>
