      <p>More than 55 million travelers are planning a trip of 50 miles or more from home for the holiday, according to <a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2019/11/aaa-more-than-55-million-travelers-taking-to-the-roads-and-skies-this-thanksgiving/">AAA</a>.</p>
      <p>“Millions of thankful Americans are starting the holiday season off right with a Thanksgiving getaway,” said AAA Travel Vice President Paula Twidale. “Travel remains one of their top priorities for the holiday season.”</p>
      <p>Gasoline prices are helping. They’re about the same or a bit cheaper than a year ago, giving travelers a little extra spending money.</p>
      <p>The busiest travel days are Tuesday and Wednesday. In major cities, traffic delays will be multiplied more than threefold.</p>
      <p>Trevor Reed with INRIX, a travel analytics company, says people hitting the roads must be prepared for major delays.</p>
      <p>“Although travel times will peak on Wednesday afternoon nationally, travelers should expect much heavier than normal congestion throughout the week,” Reed said.</p>
      <p>If you need to fly at the last minute, Thanksgiving Day has the cheapest tickets.</p>
      <p>Still, most folks who are traveling for the holiday are driving:</p>
      <p>-- Automobiles: 49.3 million travelers will hit the road this Thanksgiving, the most since 2005 and 2.8% more than last year.<br/>-- Planes: With 4.6% growth, air travel will see the biggest increase in travel volume during the Thanksgiving holiday, with 4.45 million Americans expected to fly.<br/>-- Trains, buses and cruise ships: Travel by other modes will reach 1.49 million, a slight increase of 1.4% from 2018.</p>
      <p>Warm-weather locations are the most popular, according to AAA Travel bookings. Florida is a top draw, with four cities in the Top 10.</p>
      <p>1, Orlando, Florida<br/>2. Anaheim, California<br/>3. New York, New York<br/>4. Las Vegas, Nevada<br/>5. Honolulu, Hawaii<br/>6. Lauderdale, Florida<br/>7. Tampa, Florida<br/>8. Kahului, Maui, Hawaii<br/>9. Phoenix, Arizona<br/>10. Miami, Florida</p>
