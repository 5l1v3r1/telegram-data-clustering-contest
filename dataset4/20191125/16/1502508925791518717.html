      <h1>IL&amp;FS case: NCLT turns heat on CEOs of Axis, Standard Chartered Bank</h1>
      <h2>Bankers, NCLT said, failed to appear in the case relating to the IL&amp;FS fraud despite repeated notices from the ministry of corporate affairs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:27:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:27</time> by <a rel="author">Subrata Panda</a></address>
      <p>The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Monday issued notices to the chief executive officers (CEOs) of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/axis-bank">Axis Bank </a>and Standard Chartered Bank, asking them to personally appear in the contempt proceedings against them for violating the tribunal’s order, failing which non-bailable warrants would be issued against them.</p>
      <p>Bankers, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nclt">NCLT </a>said, failed to appear in the case relating to the IL&amp;FS fraud despite repeated notices from the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA). The matter is scheduled to be heard by the tribunal next on December 16.</p>
      <p>The official spokesperson of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/axis-bank">Axis Bank </a>said, “The matter pertains to operations of these accounts in the bank’s branch. The bank has high respect for all court/tribunal Orders. Bank denies the allegations and on receipt of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nclt">NCLT </a>Order, Bank will take appropriate steps.”</p>
      <p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/standard-chartered-bank">Standard Chartered Bank </a>said they have not received the copy of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nclt">NCLT </a>order. "Upon reviewing the contents of the order, we will decide the way forward".</p>
      <p>Sources however said the CEO of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/standard-chartered-bank">Standard Chartered Bank </a>will be present on the next date of hearing.</p>
      <p>The Bench was presided over by Bhaskara Pantula Mohan and Rajesh Sharma. Amitabh Chaudhry is the CEO of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/axis-bank">Axis Bank </a>and Standard Chartered Bank’s CEO is Zarin Daruwala.</p>
      <p>The Mumbai bench of the NCLT, in April this year, issued notices to Chaudhary, Daruwala, Ramesh Bawa (former managing director (MD) and CEO of IL&amp;FS Financial Services) and his wife for violating the tribunal’s order. It had also asked them to furnish their replies to the contempt pleas filed against them within two weeks.</p>
      <p>In December 2018, the NCLT had passed an order which restrained nine erstwhile directors of the beleaguered Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&amp;FS), including Bawa, from disposing of their assets and creating third-party rights on their properties.</p>
      <p>On January 16, 2019, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal allowed them to withdraw up to Rs 2 lakh a month from any one of the bank accounts after intimating the NCLT.</p>
      <p>However, the MCA alleged that Bawa had transferred Rs 3.84 crore from his ICICI Bank account to his daughter Akansha on December 3, 2018, despite being fully aware that a petition was being filed before the NCLT to freeze assets of the directors.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, while the hearing for freezing of the assets of IL&amp;FS directors was on, Bawa further transferred Rs 1.14 crore from his Axis Bank account.</p>
      <p>And, while an order was passed restraining the company’s directors from disposing of their assets, Bawa had accessed his lockers in Axis Bank and Standard Chartered.</p>
      <p>The government had alleged that the lockers, along with the bank accounts, were operated despite notices by the NCLT to banks and the Indian Banks’ Association.</p>
