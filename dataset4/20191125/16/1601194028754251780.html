      <p>Lorenzo Insigne will miss Napoli's Champions League trip to Liverpool due to an elbow injury.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old suffered the problem during Saturday's Serie A game with AC Milan; he was replaced after 65 minutes of the 1-1 draw at San Siro.</p>
      <p>Insigne has four goals and five assists in all competitions this season but has not been included in Napoli's 20-man squad for the match at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Fabian Ruiz and Faouzi Ghoulam have been selected, however, despite training separately from their team-mates on Monday.</p>
      <p>Carlo Ancelotti's side beat Liverpool 2-0 in the opening round of fixtures and can make certain of a place in the last 16 of the Champions League with victory over the Premier League leaders on Wednesday.</p>
