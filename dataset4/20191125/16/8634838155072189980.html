      <h1>Supermarket Supervisor Caught Assaulting Female Colleague in Deeper Trouble</h1>

        <b>A Kajiado court sitting on November 25, ordered that Ibrahim Taraiya, the man captured on CCTV camera assaulting a female colleague at Eastmatt Supermarket Kajiado branch, to be remanded until December 6.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to a report by the <i>Kenya News Agency (KNA)</i>, the prosecution team pushed for Taraiya to be denied bail in court in fear that he may be a flight risk, a key factor in bail denial for suspects.</p>
      <p>Ibrahim Kiruti Taraiya who appeared before Chief Magistrate Susan Shitubi November 25, had pleaded with the court to release him on bail as he was the sole breadwinner for his family.</p>

      <p>Through a Twitter post, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions wrote;</p>
      <p>“Prosecution led by Solomon Njeru told the court that Ibrahim has been threatening Sarah Atieno, the teller he is accused of assaulting.”</p>
      <p>According to <i>KNA</i>, the prosecution considered Taraiya to be a flight risk.</p>
      <p>“The accused was arrested near the Kenya -Tanzania border, hence he is a flight risk. If released he is likely to interfere with witnesses as well as be a threat to the victim who has since been forced to quit her job and relocate to Nairobi as she fears for her life,” the prosecution argued.</p>
      <p>Taraiya was re-arrested on Saturday after the ODPP issued an order for the arrest following social media uproar over the incident.</p>
      <p>The suspect had earlier been arrested on Tuesday, November 19, but was released on Wednesday after the victim allegedly withdrew the case.</p>
      <p>Taraiya who pleaded not guilty to the charges read to him will now appear before the Kajiado High Court in Kajiadoin ten days for the mention of the case.</p>
      <p>The suspect was arrested on Saturday, November 23, in Kajiado after the video showing him conducting the heinous act went viral, in a move that attracted public outrage calling for prompt action from law enforcers.</p>

      <p>In the video that did the rounds on social media platforms, Taraiya was seen pulling the cashier and later clobbering her mercilessly, an act that took the intervention of a colleague to save the female cashier.</p>
      <p>The cause of the violent act has not yet been clearly established but investigations are still ongoing.</p>
      <p>On November 22, the supermarket confirmed that Taraiya was their employee and had been laid off.</p>
      <p>“We as Eastmatt condemn and do not stand for such heinous acts of disrespect against any of our staff and more so women.</p>
      <p>“The individual in question acted solely and has been suspended with a report officially being filed with the Kajiado County police [who] are handling the matter accordingly,” the statement read.</p>
