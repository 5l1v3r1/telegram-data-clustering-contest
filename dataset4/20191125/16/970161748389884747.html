      <h1>Blue Story is being used as a scapegoat by Vue Cinemas, plain and simple</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:29:27+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://metro.co.uk/author/alicia-adejobi/" target="_blank">Alicia Adejobi</a></address>

        <b>It took little more than 24 hours for Vue Cinemas to ban Blue Story from showing at their venues.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The drastic decision was sparked by a brawl, which reportedly erupted while Rapman’s critically-acclaimed new movie was being screened in Birmingham on Saturday. It’s said ‘pockets of fighting’ broke out at the Star City complex in the Nechells area of the city, where thugs armed with machetes descended on the venue.</p>
      <p>There’s no doubt that anyone who witnessed the scenes first-hand must have been terrified and horrified.</p>
      <p>West Midlands Police acted accordingly and armed officers were deployed to the cinema where they made several arrests.</p>
      <p>So far, there are conflicting reports about whether the fights took place inside the screening of Blue Story, in the foyer or close to the cinema. According to The Guardian, a police spokesperson said it’s not believed the incident took place inside the Blue Story screening.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>In other words, the brawl likely had nothing to do with the film.</p>
      <p>Either way, make no mistake, the incidents have been blatantly attributed to Blue Story, the movie with a majority black cast about gangs in London.</p>

      <p>Even if these thugs used Blue Story as an excuse to reign terror on that particular venue, does it mean the film deserves to be pulled from every single Vue Cinema up and down the country?</p>
      <p>The decision was so drastic and made so quickly, you’d be forgiven for thinking the cinema chain were just waiting for any sign of trouble to remove the movie from their schedules.</p>
      <p>Plain and simple, Blue Story is being used as a scapegoat for gang violence and it’s wholly unfair.</p>
      <p>It’s unfair to Rapman, who is enjoying the biggest moment of his career so far, and it’s unfair to the cast of talented, rising actors who have the rare opportunity to shine in front of large audiences.</p>
      <p>But maybe this was the unspoken motive all along.</p>

      <p>After all, there have been many cases in recent history where violence has broken out during screenings of blockbuster movies, boasting more of an a-list cast than Blue Story, but they weren’t banned at the drop of a hat.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>In 2012, James Eagan Holmes opened gunfire at a cinema in Aurora, Colorado during a showing of Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway.</p>
      <p>Holmes killed 12 people and injured 70 others, making it the shooting with the most number of casualties in one shooting in US history at the time.</p>
      <p>However, The Dark Knight Rises continued to play in US theatres despite the unprecedented tragedy. Sure, Warner Bros. went to great efforts to scale back promotion but it was still available to watch in theatres.</p>

      <p>When the new Joker movie was released in September, a fight broke out at a cinema in Burbank where a man received a cut to the head and others got involved in the incident. The Los Angeles Times reported that the man may have been injured with glass.</p>
      <p>But of course, Joker – which stars Joaquin Phoenix – wasn’t banned. In fact, Landmark Theaters cinema chain in the US only banned cinema-goers from wearing masks in light of the Aurora shooting seven years ago.</p>
      <p>Go figure.</p>
      <p>Blue Story is suffering the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/25/censoring-drill-artists-is-an-attack-on-black-self-expression-10970971/">same fate as drill music</a>, which is also being used as a scapegoat for the rise in crime around London.</p>
      <p>Banning Blue Story sends a worrying message for future black filmmakers and producers.</p>
      <p>Rapman has come a long way from releasing his Shiro’s Story series on YouTube – he was recently signed by Jay Z to Roc Nation and having a movie in the cinemas must be a dream come true.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>So it must then be soul crushing to have your ultimate dream pulled away right before your eyes.</p>
      <p>Today, when we should be talking about Blue Story’s box office figures, we’re wondering if it’s even possible to still watch the movie.</p>
      <p>Well you can. Vue Cinemas and Showtime may have pulled the plug prematurely, but many others including Cineworld and Odeon are standing strong with Rapman and his dream.</p>
      <p>There’s no reason to punish a whole team of talent over one isolated incident.</p>
      <p>The only way to win is to continue supporting Blue Story and show cinemas that we can enjoy films about gangs in peace.</p>
