      <p>Haven't got enough games? Don't worry, we'll sort you out.</p>
      <p>We've featured Fanatical here plenty in the past â€” they were one of the first legitimate online key resellers to sell directly in Australian dollars, well before Steam, and they've continued offering good deals to Aussies ever since.</p>
      <p>Like other stores, they've kicked off their Black Friday deals already. There's just under 2000 games on offer right now, with bargains on <i>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</i>, a fantastic bundle that includes <i>The Swindle</i>, <i>River City Ransom Underground</i> and <i>Chroma Squad</i>, <i>Quantum Break</i>, <i>Titan Quest: Ragnarok</i>, <i>Strange Brigade</i>, <i>XCOM 2</i>, <i>Hitman</i>, <i>Overcooked 2</i>, <i>Jackbox Party Pack 6</i> and much, much more.</p>
      <p>As is often the case, there's a coupon code. Entering <b>BLACK10 at checkout</b> will take a further 10 percent off all games, although it won't apply to <i>Football Manager 2020</i>, Nintendo games, pre-orders and any specially highlighted deals.</p>
      <p>The latter is usually where you get the biggest discounts. <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/">Here's the current crop of those for now:</a></p>
