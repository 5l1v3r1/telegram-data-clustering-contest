      <p>“Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” is shrouded in secrecy, but its secrets could have been spilled due to a careless actor.</p>
      <p>The movie’s director, J.J. Abrams, <a href="https://twitter.com/GMA/status/1198962112590053377">told Good Morning America</a> on Monday that the script was sold on eBay after someone who was cleaning an actor’s hotel room found the script under their bed.</p>
      <p>“One of our actors, I won’t say which one – I want to, but I won’t – left it under their bed and it was found by someone who was cleaning their place,” Abrams said. “And it was given to someone else, who then went to sell it on eBay.”</p>
      <p>Abrams said that someone at Disney bought the script before anyone else could.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/11/25/jj-abrams-rise-of-skywalker-script-leaked/?utm_content=link&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=entertainmentweekly_ew&amp;amp;utm_term=1998A99C-0F94-11EA-A323-7ACE4744363C">Entertainment Weekly noted</a>, the top-billed stars of the movie (Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver, for example) are the likely culprits, as supporting actors probably weren’t given full scripts.</p>
      <p>“The Rise of Skywalker” is the finale to the nine-movie <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/demand-for-disney-standalone-star-wars-movies-after-solo-analysis-2019-11">“Star Wars”</a> Skywalker Saga. It hits theaters on December 20.</p>
