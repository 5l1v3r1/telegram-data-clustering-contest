      <p><b>Katie Holmes</b> is not permanently moving to Australia, despite an absurd tabloid report. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can debunk the story. There’s no truth to it.</p>
      <p>The actress recently visited Australia to help raise funds for the Ronald McDonald House, which provides money and resources for sick children and their families. Instead of writing about her philanthropic efforts, <i><b>New Idea</b></i> is using the trip to invent a bogus scenario about her permanently relocating Down Under.</p>
      <p>The first piece of evidence the magazine uses to support its story is the news that Holmes recently put her Los Angeles home on the market. However, the tabloid doesn’t mention that the actress’s full-time residence is New York City, which is where her 13-year-old daughter Suri attends school. The outlet is either unaware of where Holmes primarily lives or omitted that tidbit because it doesn’t fit its narrative.</p>
      <p>From there, the outlet says Holmes was inspired to make the move after seeing how Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky raise their kids out of the spotlight in the coastal town of Byron Bay. An alleged insider tells the tabloid that when Holmes moves to town, Pataky will “undoubtedly want to introduce Katie to her neighbor and brother-in-law, Liam Hemsworth.” Liam recently moved to Byron Bay following his split from Miley Cyrus.</p>
      <p>There are so many problems with this phony story it’s hard to know where to begin. As noted above, Holmes lives in New York City, so the sale of her LA home doesn’t suggest in any way that she’s moving overseas. Meanwhile, there’s nothing to indicate the actress is particularly friendly with Pataky. The two women have never been spotted socializing. Additionally, Liam has reportedly been dating Aussie actress Maddison Brown for the past couple of months, so Pataky has no reason to introduce Holmes to her brother-in-law.</p>
      <p>In addition to the magazine’s story making little sense, it’s also based on the word of an anonymous and untraceable “source.” <b>Gossip Cop</b> ran the scenario by Holmes’ spokesperson, who laughed it off before assuring us it’s simply “not true.” The actress isn’t permanently moving to Australia after making a charity trip there. She’s not being set up with Hemsworth either.</p>
      <p>There’s yet another reason the tabloid’s article is clearly fabricated. Back in September, <i>New Idea</i> claimed <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/katie-holmes-liam-hemsworth-romance/">Pataky planned on setting up Holmes and Hemsworth</a> once Holmes came to Australia for her charity trip. That didn’t happen and the actress has since returned to New York. This latest article says Pataky plans on introducing the two once Holmes allegedly moves there. The magazine can’t even be bothered to keep its fiction consistent.</p>
      <p>Back in May, <b>Gossip Cop</b> busted the magazine for falsely claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/katie-holmes-jamie-foxx-met-gala-pregnant/">Holmes was pregnant with Jamie Foxx’s baby</a>. In addition to the actress not carrying her ex’s child, the two split very shortly afterwards. <i>New Idea</i> simply has no idea when it comes to Holmes’ personal life.</p>
