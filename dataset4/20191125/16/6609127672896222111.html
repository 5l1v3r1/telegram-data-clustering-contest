      <p>Following the news of her tragic passing tributes flooded in for Breffni, who was described as “a star”.</p>
      <p>The Glasgow University Union (GUU) said: “We have sadly learned that one of the Union’s most favourite former Board Members, Breffni O’Connor, died tragically this weekend in Itally.</p>

      <p>“Breffni was an active member of the DF crew and PSM and later went on to hold the position of president at the SRC.</p>
      <p>“She was funny, kind, caring, passionate, robus, the best friend and a brilliant Board Member. Her smile would light up a room and she’d talk to anyone.</p>
      <p>“Indeed in a recent visit to Glasgow she took time to come into the Union and chat with all the current Board Members. She was, quite simply, a star!</p>
      <p>“The President and the Board of Management cannot express enough how sorry we are and our deepest, heartfelt condolences go to all Breffni’s family and friends.”</p>
      <p>And friend Michael Gray added: “Devastated to read that Breffni O’Connor died in an accident in Italy last Friday.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"An old friend. Her enthusiasm for life was infectious.</p>
      <p>“Her compassion for others at @UofGlasgow, where she was elected student president, was limitless. Thoughts &amp; love to her friends &amp; family.”</p>
      <p>The Department of Foreign Affairs in Ireland confirmed they are assisting the woman’s family.</p>
