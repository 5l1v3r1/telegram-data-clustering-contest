      <p>We've known for a long, long time now that the <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/final_fantasy_vii_remake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> launching March 2020 isn't the entire game -- rather the first third or so taking place in Midgar. It's a hugely expanded version of the city, but we've been wondering when we'll start to hear of what's to come beyond those boundaries. It's probably still going to be a while yet, but at least we now know that <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_vii_remake_2">Final Fantasy VII Remake 2</a> is in active development.</p>
      <p>Without an official name from Square Enix, that's what we're dubbing the game for now, although word comes from director Tetsuya Nomura that the team has turned its attention to the project. <a href="https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-developers">As part of a new article</a> focusing on some of the development leads, Nomura says: "We’ve already begun working on the next one as well, but I’m confident that playing through this title will expand your expectations just like the world that extends beyond Midgar."</p>
      <p>We think it's very safe to say that the title won't be launching until the PlayStation 5 has hit its stride, but surely we won't be waiting another five years, right? Let's pin our hopes on 2022 and allow Square Enix to let us down all over again. When do you think Final Fantasy VII Remake 2 will launch? Share your predictions in the comments below.</p>
