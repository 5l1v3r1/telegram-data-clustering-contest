      <p>On Sunday, police recovered the instruments from Rafid Hatchery near Dewli field, said Damurhuda Model Police Station chief Sukumar Biswas.</p>
      <p>Around 3:30pm, a large plastic balloon flew in and landed on the wheat field owned by Abul Kalam, a local resident, Biswas old bdnews24.com.</p>
      <p>A solar box, a battery and another box that looks like a camera were attached to the balloon. The top of the box was wrapped in the Indian flag.</p>

      <p>A note written on a box in Bangla says, “Don’t smoke while the balloon is bloated, don’t sink the box in water, don’t hit it with sticks, don’t set fire to the box and don’t touch the box until the police or authorities come in. Damaging the box is a punishable offence, the box is not dangerous.”</p>
      <p>The other box had a different note that says “please inform the local police station or call the mobile number written on the box if you find the box”.</p>
