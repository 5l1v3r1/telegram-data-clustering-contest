      <h1>"Anyone can win trophies at Celtic" says man who doesn't win trophies</h1>
      <h2>Sam Allardyce has delivered the verdict on Scottish football that no-one asked for says OldFirmFacts</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:44:44+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:44</time> by <a rel="author">Old Firm Facts</a></address>
      <p>Sam Allardyce. A man whose highlights as England manager could be written on the back of one of the dozens of Ginsters pasty wrappers strewn across the floor of his car.</p>
      <p>Allardyce was a guest this week on Alan Brazil’s talkSPORT show, in which middle-aged Proper Football Men compete to see whose face can turn the most worrying shade of puce.</p>
      <p>In a debate about whether it was necessary to have won silverware in order to take a major English Premier League manager’s job, Sam 'You can still get around it' Allardyce said “We can all go to Celtic and win trophies. We can all go to, well it’ll soon be <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> I think the way that Steven Gerrard’s going they’ll start winning trophies again”.</p>
      <p>Allardyce then Brexited: “The best way to get a Premier League job is change your name if you’re British to a foreign name...If I was Allardicio I could have managed Man United”. Embarrassing, but at least he didn’t put on an exaggerated foreign acc...no, wait, he put on an exaggerated foreign accent.</p>
      <p>‘If I had a funny name I’d have a better job’ is Allardyce’s ‘Hey Jude’, except he drags out the gibberish part at the end far longer than Paul McCartney could ever dream of. He repeats it so often Knocked Up on ITV2 would be embarrassed.</p>
      <p>This idea that “anyone” can go to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> and win trophies is an interesting one. Let’s try not to be too cynical though. This is, after all, the man who in the 28 years since he began his managerial career has accumulated such trophies as the League of Ireland First Division title in 1992, the Football League Third Division title in 1998, the Football League First Division play-off trophy in 2001, the Football League Championship play-off trophy in 2012 and literally nothing else*. The voice of authority has spoken.</p>
      <p>He’s right, though, about the sort of nobody that can take Celtic to the title. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> won seven trophies during his time at the club, and what’s he doing now? Languishing in second place with Leicester in the English Premier League, just one point above champions Manchester City and a full EIGHT points behind Champions League winners Liverpool. What a chump.</p>
      <p>Of course, I’m just a guy at a keyboard who never made it in the game, while Allardyce is a man who reached the pinnacle of his career when he was appointed England manager in 2016. He enjoyed a 50% win record during his time in charge, seeing off Slovakia in his first contest and being beaten by the Daily Telegraph in his second. You can read every last detail of his England story in a tell-all pamphlet.</p>
      <p>Three years later he finds himself patronising Scottish football from afar, putting on funny foreigner accents like he's in a country on the verge of extracting itself from the European Union or something.</p>
      <p>Whether it's Neil Lennon, Steven Gerrard or Graeme Murty, the winner of this year's Scottish Premiership will forever be associated with that triumph.</p>
      <p>Mention Sam Allardyce to the average fan, however, and they'll think of REDACTED REDACTED Daily Telegraph REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED £400,000 REDACTED Chicken and REDACTED Pot Noodle REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED pint of wine.</p>
