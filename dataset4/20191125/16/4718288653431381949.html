      <p>The incident allegedly took place when Archer was leaving the field after the end of the first Test at Bay Oval, Mount Maunganui.</p>
      <p>"A bit disturbing hearing racial insults today whilst battling to help save my team. the crowd was been amazing this week except for that one guy, @TheBarmyArmy was good as usual also," the 24-year-old Archer wrote on his twitter handle.</p>
      <p>The Barbados-born English cricketer accounted for double centurion BJ Watling (205) and scored 30 from 50 balls but could not save his team from going down by an innings and 65 runs in Mount Maunganui.</p>
      <p>New Zealand Cricket (NZC) issued a statement apologising to Archer for the incident.</p>
      <p>"We are shocked and disappointed to hear of the verbal abuse @JofraArcher received after the Test today. @englandcricket might be our rivals but they're also our friends and racist abuse is never okay!" NZC tweeted.</p>
