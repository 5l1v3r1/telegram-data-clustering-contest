      <h1>New scheme will ask passengers to wear a badge if they are okay to gave up their seat for a disabled person</h1>
      <h2>It's happening after some disabled people said they had been abused on public transport</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:46:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:46</time> by <a rel="author">David Whitfield</a></address>
      <p>A campaign is to be launched in Nottingham asking bus and tram passengers to to wear a badge if they are happy to gave up their seat for a disabled person.</p>
      <p>The scheme involving NET trams and NCT buses will be launched on December 3, which is the National Day for Disabled People.</p>
      <p>It is just part of the Nottingham City Council Disability History Month which was officially launched on Monday November 25, at the Council House.</p>
      <p>The council says it comes after some disabled people, especially those with invisible disabilities, reported that they had received very negative responses – sometimes abuse - when asking people on public transport to give up their seats.</p>
      <p>It was suggested that people with transport needs could wear a badge saying,'Please offer me a seat’, while people who were prepared to support disabled people needing seats could wear one saying, ‘Happy to move for you'.</p>
      <p>It is one part of a month of events focusing on the history and experiences of disabled people in Nottingham.</p>
      <p>It ties in with the national Disability History Month running from November 18 to December 20, which is focusing on "disabled leaders throughout history and their struggle for acceptance".</p>
      <p>Here in Nottingham the launch event featured the My Sight Notts Choir as well as appearances from Richard Reiser, UK Disability History Month co-ordinator, and Charlotte Throssel, CEO of Disability Support Nottingham.</p>

      <p>Cllr Eunice Campbell-Clark, city council portfolio holder for equalities, said she was looking forward to engagements across the city during the month, and to "challenging disablism and achieving equalities."</p>
      <p>She added: "As a city we have made tremendous steps to engage with the wider disabled communities since the first launch in 2010."</p>
      <p>UK Disability History Month was established in 2010, and this is the fourth year Nottingham City Council has supported it.</p>
      <p>Other events taking place locally are:</p>
      <p>* A workshop for people with learning disabilities about staying safe online on November 29;</p>
      <p>* An exhibition at the New Art Exchange called ‘Sensing Beyond Sight’ featuring art and films produced between Nottingham Trent University and My Sight Notts, which supports local blind and partially sighted people, on December 14 and 15;</p>
      <p>* A conference called ‘Disability: Leading by Example' on December 4.</p>
      <p>The main theme of the national month is looking at the way disability has changed from the 1970s onwards from being seen as a personal burden to a human rights issue.</p>
