      <h1>Ileana D'Cruz: Always had issues accepting my body the way it is</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:14:11+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:14</time> by <a rel="author">IANS</a></address>
      <p>Ileana DCruz, who regularly gives sleepless nights to netizens with sexy snapshots on social media, has revealed that she has always had issues accepting her body the way it is.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the 33-year-old actress claims that she is in a happier space right now, and that she respects her body a lot more than before.</p>
      <p>During an interview with IANS, Ileana said: "I have always had issues accepting my body the way it is. I have finally come to a place maybe where I am learning to like it how it is. I am respecting it a lot more and taking care of it a lot more. And I think it is showing, so I am happier right now."</p>
      <p>Ileana, who returned to the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> screen after a hiatus with the multistarrer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/'Pagalpanti'">'Pagalpanti'</a>, also shared diet and fitness tips with fans: "There are times when I workout like crazy, for months. I lose weight and look great. Then, I give it up for a while. I have realised that if you change your lifestyle completely, it makes a difference. Earlier I used to spend so much time in the gym and did not focus as much on what I was eating. I have realised that ninety percent of what you look like is your diet. So, you need to eat well. Invest in a good nutritionist if possible. Eat clean, eat well. That's what I try and do as much as possible now. I am very careful about what I am eating. Keep a check on how much sugar you consume daily."</p>
      <p>While she sets social media afire with her social media pics, Ileana admits it isn't easy to look picture perfect in real life all the time.</p>
      <p>"People have a certain perception of how you are supposed to look. When you are portrayed on screen, you are portrayed in a glamorous way. Women are meant to look pretty and perfect. Now there is the paparazzi phase. When you get papped outside the gym or airport, you often look just normal. I try to put in a sense of reality on <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Instagram">Instagram</a> more than anything," she said, adding: "I am a normal person and there are days when I don't look perfect and it's fine."</p>
      <p>On the work front, Ileana's latest release 'Pagalpanti' is currently running in theatres. The comedy film has been directed by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anees-Bazmee">Anees Bazmee</a>.</p>
      <p>The actress will next be seen alongside <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Abhishek-Bachchan">Abhishek Bachchan</a> in 'The Big Bull'.</p>
