                      <p>Moreover, Hazard also overlooked Cristiano Ronaldo, whom he has replaced at Real Madrid, as the former is also a favourite to land in the top 3 positions in the award ceremony.</p>

                            <p>As of now, Mane and Van Dijk have a great claim over the award considering their recent performances in the Premier League and Champions League triumph last season, but Messi’s incredible stats last season makes a strong case for him.</p>
                            <p>With the gala set to be organized soon, it remains to be seen who bags the award by the end of the night in France.</p>
