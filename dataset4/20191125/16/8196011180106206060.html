      <p>The image of Jackie Healy-Rae smiling as he squeezed a man’s neck was compelling evidence in an assault case against him, a court heard today.</p>
      <p>Before finding him, his brother Kevin and a third man guilty of assault, the judge also noted they were seen on CCTV laughing as they walked away after the attack.</p>
      <p>Speaking at Tralee District Court, Judge David Waters said despite their barrister’s claim they had acted in self-defence, they chose to ignore an opportunity they had to avoid a confrontation.</p>
      <p>TD Michael Healy-Rae’s two sons had denied they assaulted Kieran James after a row broke out in the queue outside a chip van in the centre of Kenmare town.</p>
      <p>Instead, they claimed the row, in the early hours of December 28, 2017, stemmed from the fact that people involved ‘hate’ the Healy-Raes because of their politics.</p>
      <p>Their defence barrister claimed the garda investigation against them and Malachy Scannell, 34, of Inchinacoosh, Kilgarvan, was "manifestly unfair’"</p>
      <p>But Judge Waters dismissed the idea they acted in self-defence and said he did not accept the Healy-Raes had been treated unfairly by gardaí.</p>
      <p>In earlier hearings, it was said that after Kevin Healy-Rae arrived at the chip van around 3am on the night in question, he got into a row with Mr James.</p>
      <p>He then asked his brother for help and a scuffle broke out, during which Jackie Healy-Rae held Mr James in a headlock for about 30 seconds.</p>
      <p>The two groups then split up, with those with Mr James heading one way, followed later by the Healy-Raes.</p>
      <h3>'Squeezing his neck and smiling'</h3>
      <p>The brothers and Mr Scannell caught up with Mr James and he received about six punches to his face, sustaining injuries later treated in hospital.</p>
      <p>Before finding all three guilty of the charges against them, Judge Waters told the court: “An important point to realise is that Jackie Healy-Rae was faced with a choice.</p>
      <p>“I believe it was established that Kevin Healy-Rae was intoxicated.</p>
      <p>“What happened in the chip shop queue is no different to what happens in so many towns and villages around the country day in, day out.</p>
      <p>“Had (Jackie) made a decision at that stage - which he should have done - to say ‘come on, let's go home, stop, you had a few drinks’, and exercised proper judgement at that stage, we would not be in the position that we are in. Instead he got involved and he assaulted Mr James.”</p>
      <p>Before adjourning the case for sentencing on December 6, he added: “The evidence that stuck in my mind was Jackie Healy-Rae with Mr James caught in a headlock squeezing his neck and smiling as (people) looked at him doing it."</p>
