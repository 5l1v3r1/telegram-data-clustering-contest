      <h1>Lewis Morgan wanted for Celtic loan exit as St Mirren eye January return</h1>
      <h2>Jim Goodwin has revealed he wants to bring the winger back to Paisley.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:28:22+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:28</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>Jim Goodwin has revealed <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a> want to re-sign <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lewis-morgan">Lewis Morgan</a> on-loan from Celtic.</p>
      <p>The Buddies boss would jump at the chance to bring the winger back to Paisley in January, two years after he signed for the Premiership champions.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old returned to the Simple Digital Arena for six months before linking up with the Hoops in summer 2018.</p>
      <p>But Morgan has been left on the fringes under Neil Lennon and previously spent time on-loan with Sunderland during Brendan Rodgers' tenure.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jim-goodwin">Goodwin</a> admits he's been given no indication the Scotland international will be made available come the New Year but still plans to open talks with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> .</p>
      <p>He said: "The January window is approaching, we've been looking at our own squad and looking at different options that are out there.</p>

      <p>"Of course Lewis would be a player we'd love to get, he's obviously been here before and been very successful. He's a quality footballer but at this minute in time he's not available.</p>
      <p>"We haven't been told by Celtic that he is and he remains part of their squad.Â </p>
      <p>"I wouldn't hide from the fact that if we could have an opportunity of making that one happen then absolutely we would.</p>
      <p>"We'll wait until the window opens and we will have those conversations then.</p>
      <p>"It's all well and good speaking to Celtic but the player needs to want to come as well and he'll have people advising him on that but Lewis is among a number of players that we're looking at.</p>
      <p>"We need to strengthen again in January, it's as simple as that."</p>
