      <h1>Justice minister set to announce hiring of eight articling students</h1>

      <p>The Alberta government hopes that by doubling its number of articling students, the long arm of the law will operate more efficiently.</p>
      <p>Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer says eight additional articling students will be brought into the system next summer to assist with prosecutions. He is to announce the initiative Monday at the Calgary Courts Centre.</p>
      <p>“We want to make sure the justice system meets the priorities of Albertans and right now, we want to make sure that law students who are trained here have the opportunity to stay in Alberta,” Schweitzer told Postmedia on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“What we’re doing is doubling our articling class from eight to 16 lawyers and then the subsequent year, we’re going to go up to 20 lawyers.</p>
      <p>The announced change will see students enter the workforce next June with another four to follow in 2021. Schweitzer’s hope is that when they finish articling, they could be hired back as full-time prosecutors.</p>
      <p>“We want to make sure that we can hire Albertans to work here . . . especially in rural Alberta,” said Schweitzer. “There’s many students educated at our law schools that come from Grande Prairie, that come from smaller centres and mid-sized centres.</p>
      <p>“It will also give us an opportunity to recruit them afterwards when they’re done their articles and potentially become prosecutors.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.lawsociety.ab.ca/resource-centre/key-resources/ethics-and-professionalism/what-can-a-student-at-law-do/">Law Society of Alberta</a>, once registered as a student-at-law, articling students are able to provide legal services the same as a lawyer can, as long as they are acting under the supervision of another lawyer.</p>
      <p>The hope is that students will head to smaller centres and rural areas to tackle what Schweitzer called a backlog of criminal cases. To that end, a government incentive and the covering of expenses will be offered by the province, the justice minister added.</p>
      <p>“Right now, our prosecution service simply has had way too high of a caseload, so we need to get more lawyers into the system, more lawyers to fill the 25 unfilled positions that we have right now, and get those 50 new prosecutors hired at the fastest possible opportunity,” said Schweitzer.</p>
      <p>“We really want to focus to make sure we get these articling students into rural Alberta,” he said. “Right now, there’s a gap and we want to recruit people to start there. It’s critical to making sure we have a sustainable justice department going forward.</p>
      <p>“One of the gaps I noticed is the fact we didn’t hire enough students into the system. This is part of a long-term strategy by us.”</p>
      <p>Schweitzer said the hiring of the article students will fit into the government’s 2020 budget.</p>
