      <p>In 25 games through the start of the 2019-20 season, the Burnaby, B.C. native has five goals and 16 points, which puts him on pace for 64 points.</p>
      <p>The Oilers are off to a hotstart to the season, leading the Pacific Division with a 15-7-3 record, amassing33 points. Their power play is also first in the league, operating with a 31.5 success rate (second in the NHL).</p>
      <p>"RNH" has played a key role in providing Edmonton with secondary scoring, with Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl leading the charge and combining for 93 points through the first 25 games of the year.</p>
      <p>Still, the Oilers don't benefit from a lot of forward depth, so a long-term injury for Nugent-Hopkins would be detrimental for Edmonton.</p>
