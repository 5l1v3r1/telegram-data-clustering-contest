      <p>A team of ex-Bungie developers and Halo composer Marty O’Donnell present a PSVR exclusive four years in the making.</p>
      <p>Developer Highwire Games, with its small team of industry veterans, announced Golem in 2015, a full year before PlayStation VR was released. With staff who worked on Halo and Destiny, and a musical score by the legendary Marty O’Donnell – who was responsible for Halo’s soundtrack, expectations were sky high. Following a series of delays Golem is finally here, but has the extended gestation been worth it?</p>
      <p>Golem tells the story of a young girl, Twine, whose family subsists on plundering relics from an ancient city. The game starts with an incident that kills her sister and leaves Twine bedridden, but also in possession of a dream stone, an artefact that lets her take full bodily control of a four-metre tall stone golem. For the rest of the game you play as Twine, who in turns controls the golem, in a sort of Being John Malkovich-style person inside a person inside a golem.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Taking control of the golem is immediately striking, the sense of becoming a hulking monster carrying a massive iron sword, stomping your way through beautiful ancient ruins, is one that you won’t soon forget. But it’s a short honeymoon period because Golem has many quirks, not all of which are good.</p>
      <p>The first oddity is that you play the game with a single PlayStation Move controller, giving you command of the golem’s weapon arm as you wield a sword, halberd, or mace. There is another arm, but it hangs by the golem’s side throughout the game and is never used for anything. The other peculiarity of the one Move control method is that you use your upper body to steer.</p>
      <p>Holding down the trigger, you gently lean in the direction you want to go and off the golem lumbers. When you’re leaning forwards, looking left or right will realign you to that direction, and after a bit of experimentation you find that rather than leaning your whole body, a modest inclination of your head is all it takes, making for a workable if mildly uncomfortable control interface.</p>

      <p>For those who habitually slump on their sofas while playing video games (i.e. absolutely every console gamer), Golem’s control system will be like a stern school mistress telling you to sit up straight and pull your shoulders back. That may not be entirely welcome. The absurdly ponderous walking pace, whilst true to controlling a lumbering stone giant, is also unlikely to win it many new friends. It means you’ll be leaning one way or another for most of the game, which with the added weight of a VR headset means neck and backache for all.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>You can play using a DualShock 4, but even then using the stick to walk sets you off at an even more tortoise-like pace, meaning you still need to lean to bring yourself up to regular speed. Highwire has promised to get rid of the leaning requirement in an upcoming patch, but at time of writing Golem’s movement system is borderline sadistic.</p>
      <p>The Endless City itself looks lovely, its Moorish architecture of gleaming golden domes, turrets and arches stretching off to the horizon, framed by golden sand dunes. There’s a fuzziness to distant objects that will be familiar to PlayStation VR players, but it hangs together really well, and with O’Donnell’s orchestral score, there’s an atmosphere of magic and mystery that really sells its setting.</p>
      <p>The city has a SoulsBorne structure where there are multiple routes forward from any given position, as well as shortcuts that you open by unlocking doors or chopping the wooden bars that hold gates shut. It’s just as well, because each time you die you’ll be deposited at your last checkpoint, and must work your way back to where you were.</p>
      <p>And you’ll die a reasonable amount. While nowhere near as challenging or responsive as Dark Souls, there’s still a hefty, steady rhythm to combat. Against the more fleet-footed, spear-throwing enemies, you simply chop or dodge incoming missiles while slowly walking to within smashing range, but fellow golems present a stiffer test. To defeat them you have to parry their blows until a part of them turns briefly to crystal, at which point you can strike back.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>That’s all very well in theory, but in practice PlayStation VR’s antiquated light-based positioning system is a point of continual frustration as your sword fails to move as quickly as you do, or falters for a split second as it tracks your motion, leaving you open to attacks that you not only saw coming, but moved to block. Some of that might just about be excusable as a realistic simulation of huge, plodding stone monsters, but some of it is plain old technical ineptitude.</p>

      <p>These problems are compounded against giant golems, whose attacks kill you in a single hit. You do eventually get the hang of moving forward to taunt them into attacking, before pulling back to dodge their assaults until they perform a whirling sword attack, which is your cue to nip in and smite them, but even once you know how to do it there are frequent moments where the movement system just doesn’t react in time to prevent yet another forced restart.</p>
      <p>You’ll also lose all your hard-won equipment each time you die, which includes your golem’s mask that acts as a key to unlocking routes through the city, buff-supplying gems, and whatever weapon you were carrying. Each one is single use, so once it’s been equipped, when you die it’s gone forever. The other downside of dying is that there are only a few checkpoints scattered around the city, so you’ll regularly find yourself walking for several minutes – and re-fighting any golem encounters along the way – just to get back to where you died.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>That system also means that when you pick up new equipment, usually after defeating a golem, you can’t use it until you die or restart, which also means losing your current weapon, mask, and buff. It’s particularly annoying to lose a powerful weapon, rare mask, and 20 minutes’ progress to a foible of motion-sensing – an issue that echoes through the entire game. You do get better at fighting, but even after hours of play there are all too frequent moments where your golem’s failure to mimic a parrying motion results in an irritating premature demise.</p>
      <p>There’s a little bit of lore to uncover via what are effectively audio logs hidden about the place, but other than that the plot is confined to an opening and closing cut scene, and winds up feeling more like the prelude to a bigger story than a satisfying tale in its own right. While there is certainly much to recommend about Golem, the maze-like city and evocative score in particular, its problems outweigh its pleasures.</p>
      <h3>Golem review summary</h3>
      <p><b>In Short:</b> A game of exploration and combat that’s hamstrung by PlayStation VR’s unreliable motion-tracking and a movement system seemingly designed by someone who hates you.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> The city looks incredible, its chaotic network of passages and stairs just begging to be explored, and the orchestral score is magnificent.</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> The movement system never feels right, with a sluggish walking pace and patchy motion-sensing resulting in unfair deaths.</p>
      <p><b>Score:</b> 4/10</p>
