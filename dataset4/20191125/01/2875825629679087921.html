      <h2>Lampard said his young Chelsea side are 'ahead of the curve' after one of their biggest tests of the season so far - but must now show character by bouncing back from defeat</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:59:31+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:59</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Frank Lampard claimed his young side took another major step in their development – despite defeat to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> suffered a first Premier League loss for two months when they were <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/man-city-2-1-chelsea-20945552">beaten 2-1 by City</a> on Saturday, but Lampard said the manner of their performance endorsed the belief in his progressing side.</p>
      <p>“The feeling in the dressing room, it looked like they were very disappointed,” said the Stamford Bridge boss.</p>
      <p>“It’s probably a simple answer, because we lost, but they also expect a lot of themselves, so I think we’ll take confidence from this.</p>
      <p>“For some of them, it’s their first experience at this stadium, against the high-level team City are. Experiences like today are great for them.</p>

      <p>“They have to take them on the chin, in terms of the defeat, but also realise these are the kinds of levels we want to get to.</p>
      <p>“I’m really happy with a lot of our stuff this season, so maybe that means we’re slightly ahead of the curve.</p>
      <p>“Now our test is, ‘Can we bounce back from a defeat when we’re used to winning?’ – because that’s another challenge for us all.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea took the lead after N'Golo Kante got the better of Benjamin Mendy to put Lampard's young Blues in front.</p>

      <p>But Kevin de Bruyne leveled for City against his former side before Riyad Mahrez put them ahead for the first time after firing past Kepa Arrizabalaga following a weaving run.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> winger Raheem Sterling had the ball in the net to make it three in stoppage time, but the effort was ruled out after a VAR check.</p>
      <p>Chelsea's defeat - which followed six straight wins in the league for Lampard's side - left the Londoners in fourth place in the Premier League, two points behind third-placed City.</p>
      <p>Chelsea turn their focus to the Champions League on Wednesday when they visit Valencia aiming to eke out an advantage in Group H, with the two sides currently level on points with table-toppers Ajax.</p>
      <p>They then host struggling <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> in a Premier League London derby on Saturday.</p>
