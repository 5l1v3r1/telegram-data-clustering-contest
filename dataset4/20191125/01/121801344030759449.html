      <p>Selena Gomez kicked off the <a href="https://edit.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/2019-american-music-awards-winners-complete-list-1250622">2019 American Music Awards</a> on Sunday night with a double performance of her new singles, "Lose You To Love Me" and "Look At Her Now."</p>
      <p>The rendition of Gomez's emotional ballad "Lose You To Love Me," was shot in black and white, with her donning a floor-length, long-sleeved black dress. When it came time for the upbeat "Look At Her Now," Gomez reappeared in a sparkly bodysuit (and in color).</p>
      <p>The AMAs' cameras showed a number of audience members singing and dancing along with Gomez, including her close friend Taylor Swift.</p>
      <p>Gomez's last televised performance was also at the AMAs, where she performed "Wolves" in 2017. Her other AMA performances were in 2014 and 2015 — the latter of which was the same year Gomez released her most recent album <i>Revival</i>.</p>
      <p>"Lose You To Love Me," which marked Gomez's first-ever Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit, along with the follow-up single "Look At Her Now," are a part of her upcoming untitled album, which is slated for a Jan. 10 release. Gomez previously described the album as her "diary from the past few years."</p>
      <p>Though Gomez isn't up for any AMAs this year, she's previously been nominated for two, one of which — favorite pop/rock female artist — she won in 2016.</p>
      <p>Additional performers set to take the AMAs stage throughout Sunday night include Swift, Green Day, Billie Eilish, Lizzo, Post Malone featuring Ozzy Osbourne, Thomas Rhett, Shania Twain, and more.</p>
      <p>Hosted by Ciara, the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/topic/american-music-awards">2019 AMAs</a> are airing live from the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on ABC. </p>
