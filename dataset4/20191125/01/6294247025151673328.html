      <p>VILLAGERS from Matabeleland South Province have said the Presidential Input Scheme and the Small Holder Farmers’ Tillage Support Scheme launched by Government will go a long way in assisting them to plant this cropping season.</p>
      <p>The Government recently launched the national tillage programme to support more than 500 000 small holder farmers countrywide.</p>
      <p>The District Development Fund (DDF) is spearheading the programme after it was allocated $2 million for the national exercise which is running up to January.</p>
      <p>The programme is expected to cover about 250 000 hectares countrywide.</p>
      <p>Matabeleland South Provincial Affairs Minister, Cde Abednico Ncube recently launched the programme in Guyu, Ward 14.</p>
      <p>Speaking after receiving her inputs Ms Legina Ndlovu (73) from Sizhubane Village said: “Last year I recorded a poor harvest because of poor rains. I’m grateful that Government has assisted us with inputs and in addition will be assisting us with free tillage.</p>
      <p>“This brings hope to me because I had no seed and draught power.”</p>
      <p>Mr Cephas Sibanda also from Sizhubane Village said the Presidential Input Scheme and tillage programme came at the right time as most villagers had no draught power and seed.</p>
      <p>“Cattle and donkeys are in a poor state because of the drought and as such most families have no draught power for tillage,” he said. <b>–</b> @DubeMatutu</p>
