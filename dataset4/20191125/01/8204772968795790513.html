      <h2>Anti-social behaviour drives unions’ demand for special security units on buses and trains</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/martin-wall-7.1054630" target="_blank">Martin Wall</a></address>
      <p>Garda authorities will not put in place a dedicated transport unit to police rail services which has been sought by trade unions to deal with an upsurge in anti-social behaviour.</p>
      <p>Minister for Transport <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Shane+Ross">Shane Ross</a> said the Garda authorities believed that “effective local community policing efforts can meet the policing needs of the rail network and its stakeholders”.</p>
      <p>Mr Ross said he had received correspondence from Minister for Justice <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Charlie+Flanagan">Charlie Flanagan</a> last week, outlining the opposition of An Garda Síochána management to the introduction of a dedicated transport police section.</p>
      <p>“The report by An Garda Síochána proposes that the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Railway+Safety+Advisory+Council">Railway Safety Advisory Council</a> ( RSAC) will advise the Garda as to the priority rail locations, [while] the Garda Bureau of Community Engagement will facilitate meetings with local Garda management to ensure that an appropriate policing response is delivered.”</p>
      <p>For some time, the National Bus and Rail Union (NBRU) has sought the establishment of a dedicated transport police unit on foot of increased numbers of violent episodes on trains and buses and attacks on staff.</p>
      <h3>Anti-social behaviour</h3>
      <p>These included one incident over the recent Halloween period where a female driver was threatened with rape and had to lock herself into the cab of the bus as youths kicked on the door.</p>
      <p>NBRU general secretary Dermot O’Leary said anti-social behaviour directed at staff in both <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Dublin+Bus">Dublin Bus</a> and Bus Éireann was becoming so frequent that drivers were no longer reporting all incidents.</p>
      <p>Mr Ross said while the incidence of anti-social behaviour on the train network was increasing, it was falling or static on buses.</p>
      <p>“According to material received from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Irish+Rail">Irish Rail</a>, the number of recorded anti-social incidents has risen in recent years. In 2016 it was 492; in 2017, 680; in 2018, 789; and in 2019, up to October, 971.</p>
      <p>“Irish Rail has been encouraging employees to report all safety-critical issues, including threatening and violent behaviour, and this appears to be coming up with some fairly unsatisfactory results as far as the number of incidents is concerned.</p>
      <p>“Irish Rail has addressed the problem very energetically. On buses the trend appears to be downwards, which is encouraging. Dublin Bus has been taking a lot of measures as well. In Bus Éireann, I think the numbers are also decreasing. Therefore, whereas Iarnród Éireann has a very serious problem which remains, the bus companies have responded to the actions that have been taken.”</p>
