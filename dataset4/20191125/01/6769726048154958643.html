      <h1>Three in five Aussies struggling to sleep</h1>

      <p>IF you feel like you’re not getting enough sleep, you’re not alone.</p>
      <p>Three in five Australians are suffering from at least one symptom of insomnia, a new report has found.</p>
      <p>The Sleep Health Foundation has warned sleep deprivation is affecting people’s chances to lead healthy, happy lives.</p>
      <p>The foundation’s Professor Robert Adams says lack of sleep can affect mood, safety, health and relationships with family and mates.</p>
      <p>“It’s troubling to see just how common it is for Australians to struggle with their sleep when it’s such a vital aspect of good health and happiness,” Professor Adams said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Nearly half of Australians don’t feel like their daily lives give them enough time to get a good night’s rest most of the time, the foundation’s report has found.</p>
      <p>Women are more likely than men to be worried about getting a good night’s rest and are more often overwhelmed by thoughts when they try to sleep.</p>
      <p>Older Australians are finding it hardest to stay asleep, with almost half of those aged 65 or over waking up frequently during the night.</p>
      <p>But younger Australians, aged 18 to 24, had more difficulty falling asleep than over-65s.</p>
