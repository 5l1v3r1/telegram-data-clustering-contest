      <p>BEIRUT, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Clashes broke out between anti-government demonstrators and supporters of the Shi'ite groups Hezbollah and Amal in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, early on Monday, as tensions escalated when demonstrators blocked a main bridge.</p>
      <p>Lebanon has faced five weeks of anti-government protests, fuelled by anger at corruption among the sectarian politicians who have governed Lebanon for decades. Demonstrators want to see the entire ruling class gone from power.</p>
      <p>Hezbollah and Amal were both represented in the coalition government led by Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, who quit on Oct. 29 after the protests began. The heavily armed Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, had opposed Hariri's resignation.</p>
      <p>Army soldiers and riot police formed a barrier separating the protesters from the supporters of the Shi'ite groups on a main road known as the Ring Bridge as rocks were thrown by both sides, television footage broadcast by Lebanese media showed.</p>
      <p>Security forces fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, three local television stations reported.</p>
      <p>Supporters of Hezbollah and Amal waved the groups' flags. Earlier, they had chanted: "Shia, Shia" and slogans in support of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. On the other side, demonstrators chanted: "Revolution, revolution".</p>
      <p>Lebanese broadcaster al-Jadeed reported that fighting apparently broke out when Hezbollah and Amal supporters blamed other demonstrators for making offensive comments about Nasrallah. Reuters could not independently verify the report.</p>
      <p>The ground was strewn with rocks. A motorcycle was set on fire.</p>
      <p>The Lebanese civil defense said on its Twitter account that it was administering first aid to five people suffering from "various injuries."</p>
      <p>It was the worst tension in Beirut since a mob loyal to Hezbollah and Amal attacked and destroyed the main protest camp in central Beirut last month. The protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful.</p>
