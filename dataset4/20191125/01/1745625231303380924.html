      <p>Carrie Underwood hit the red carpet in a dazzling sequined gown.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/carrie-underwood/">Carrie Underwood</a> brought some of her signature sparkle to the American Music Awards on Sunday night. The “Cry Pretty” singer hit the red carpet in a stunning sequined dress that flashed quite a bit of leg.</p>
      <p>The former <i>American Idol</i> star’s glittering gown was a gorgeous plum color, and it was the perfect marriage of glamour and seductiveness. It had a long, sweeping cape that trailed behind Carrie as she walked the red carpet. The cape was attached to the left shoulder of the dress, while the right side of the gown featured a thin spaghetti strap that left Carrie’s arm and shoulder completely bare.</p>
      <p>The dramatic draped dress also had a plunging V-neck and an empire waist. The right side of the garment’s skirt featured a dangerously high thigh slit that went all the way up to the top of Carrie Underwood’s thigh. This detail drew attention to the athletic singer’s muscular right thigh and toned calf. On her feet, she wore a pair of shiny gold platform sandals with chunky heels. Her fabulous footwear featured squared-off peep-toes.</p>
      <p>Carrie accessorized her look with a gold choker necklace that had a vine-like design, and she wore matching statement earrings. On one of her fingers, she wore a chunky cocktail ring adorned with glittering violet gems that matched her vibrant dress.</p>

      <p>Carrie wore her shining platinum tresses straight, down, and parted to the side. For her beauty look, the “Drinking Alone” singer sported a bold brow, lush long lashes, light purple eye shadow, and a pale pink lip.</p>
      <p>Carrie Underwood’s glittering ensemble was similar to some of the <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5744445/carrie-underwood-leggy-cma-awards/">sparkly looks</a> that she wore while hosting the CMA Awards earlier this month. Fans were dismayed that Carrie <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5742873/cma-awards-slammed-carrie-underwood-empty-handed/">went home empty-handed</a> on county music’s biggest night, where she was nominated for Entertainer of the Year, Female Vocalist of the Year, and Album of the year.</p>
