      <p>It’s been a terrible past few weeks for movies at the box office. <i>Gemini Man</i> ($US 171 million gross as of this writing, with a $US 138 million budget),<i> Terminator: Dark Fate (</i>$US 249 million<i>,</i> with a $196 million budget),<i> Charlie’s Angels</i> ($US 43 million; $29 million budget) and <i>Doctor Sleep</i> ($US 62 million; $45 million budget), all missed their respective marks at the worldwide BO. When it comes to the latter three <i>movies,</i> I believe it all boils down to people not caring about these IPs anymore in 2019.</p>
      <p>One IP that people still clearly love, though, is Disney’s <i>Frozen</i>. This past weekend, <i>Frozen 2 </i>hit the big screens to mostly positive reviews from critics (scoring a 75% fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes; average rating of  6.7/10) and audiences alike (94% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes). Unlike <i>Dark Fate </i>and <i>Doctor Sleep</i>, which also garnered positive reviews, the general masses actually went out to see <i>Frozen 2</i>.</p>
      <p>In its opening weekend, the <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2424210945/?ref_=bo_hm_rs"><b>Disney animated sequel grossed US$ 127 million in North America and $US 223.2 million outside of North America for a $US 350.2 million global cume.</b></a> This means that <i>Frozen 2  </i>is now officially the highest-grossing opening weekend worldwide for an animated film of all time, eclipsing <i>Toy Story 4</i>‘s $US 244 million and 2019’s <i>The Lion King</i>‘s $US 245 million.</p>

      <p>Keeping in mind that both <i>Toy Story 4 </i>and <i>The Lion King </i>went on to gross more than $US 1 billion at the global box office by the end of their run, it looks like unless something drastic happens, <i>Frozen 2</i> will also join the coveted $US 1 billion club. But just how much will it make? If its momentum continues in the coming weeks, it’s highly possible that the film makes close to $US 1.6 billion by the end of its run, which would be roughly $US 330 million more than its original.</p>
      <p>However, <i>Frozen 2 </i>will only be competition-free for one more week. December 5th will see the release of <i>Jumanji: The Lext Level</i> which will certainly be a huge bump in the road for the animated film to overcome.</p>
