      <h1>Google Pay (Tez) for India gets a Material Theme redesign</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:55:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/arol-wright/" target="_blank">Arol Wright</a></address>
      <p>Google recently attempted to unify all of its payment services and payment solutions, which included services formerly called Android Pay and Google Wallet, under a single umbrella: Google Pay. This unification included local solutions: <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-tez-7-5-million-users-india/">Google Tez</a>, an India-only payment service based on the UPI system, was also <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-for-india-event-announcements/">rolled into Google Pay</a>. As you can guess, though, the Indian version of Google Pay has very little to do with the Google Pay you can find in the rest of the world, but that doesn’t mean it can’t receive love from Google. Now, the Google Pay for India app is receiving a Material Theme-based facelift for a change.</p>

      <p>The older version did introduce a number of design features from the newer Material Design guidelines, but the newer one goes all-in on Google’s new Material Theme design language found in other apps, and in turn, looks more consistent with its international counterpart and, of course, other Google and Android 10 apps. The whole app has a cleaner, brighter, and more consistent look all around, more fitting with Google’s Material Theme guidelines. Some things, like the UPI ID that used to be visible on the header, have been moved around, while some design features have been introduced or removed.</p>
      <p>All of these changes are rolling out through a server-side switch, but you do need to be on the latest version of the app, which you can <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.paisa.user">download on the Google Play Store</a> now. Some users might find a number of these changes a bit off-putting, while some might love it, depending on how accustomed you actually are to your layout. If you like what you see, though, then go to the Google Play Store to download it now to be in line for the rollout.</p>
