      <p>The Raiders were blown out by the Jets, and the Eagles couldn't get anything going against the Seahawks. The Panthers-Saints and Lions-Redskins matchups both ended with game-winning field goals, and the Bills got to eight wins and earned some cushion in the AFC playoff race. In the afternoon slate, the Cowboys failed to make a statement in a loss to the Patriots. In the night game, the Niners rolled the Packers.</p>
      <p>All that and more in Week 12's biggest takeaways from NFL Nation.</p>

The pass rush was effective for the second consecutive game, even with <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16734/jadeveon-clowney">Jadeveon Clowney</a> inactive and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115312/jarran-reed">Jarran Reed</a> missing the second half. It was a reversal of the first half of the season, when <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson">Russell Wilson</a> and the offense had to bail out the defense. Said linebacker <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14140/kj-wright">K.J. Wright</a>: "This defense can be the best in the league. I'm proud of us ... I believe this defense is a Super Bowl-caliber defense [and this is a] Super Bowl-caliber team." <i>-- Brady Henderson</i></p>

The Eagles have two things going for them: a resurgent defense and the easiest closing schedule in the NFL, starting with a trip to Miami next week. But with the offense sputtering this badly, nothing is guaranteed. <i>-- Tim McManus</i></p>

The Saints (9-2) now have a four-game lead over Carolina (5-6). But they will need to play a lot cleaner over the next five weeks, especially when it comes to their continued penalty woes, if they want to last into February. <i>-- Mike Triplett</i></p>

Slye, who said he felt terrible after the game, knows he let a lot of people down and all but ended Carolina's playoff hopes. He also could have put coach Ron Rivera's job in jeopardy unless the Panthers (5-6) win their final five games and make the playoffs. <i>-- David Newton</i></p>

It was the first time Mayfield had found Beckham and Landry for touchdowns in the same game, with all three coming in the first half. Mayfield set a season-high passing efficiency of 118.1, while OBJ and Landry combined for 232 receiving yards, also a season high. "They executed today at a high level," coach Freddie Kitchens said. Next up is an emotional trip to Pittsburgh, which figures to be tense given last week's melee with the Steelers. The rematch will be the dominant storyline.

Buffalo (8-3) is now two games ahead of the glut of teams vying for the second AFC wild-card spot. It was a much-needed win for the Bills with a Thanksgiving Day matchup against the Cowboys on deck and games against the Ravens, Steelers and Patriots awaiting in the following weeks. <i>-- Marcel Louis-Jacques</i></p>

Since the start of the 2017 season, the Broncos are now on their sixth quarterback -- rookie Drew Lock will be the seventh if the Broncos choose to activate him off injured reserve and play him before season's end -- their third offensive coordinator and second head coach. They're basically playing out the string, headed for their fourth consecutive losing season under John Elway. <i>-- Jeff Legwold</i></p>

"I finally got singled up," Mack said with a smile. "And I knew I had to make the most of the opportunity."

Haskins also showed his 22-year-old side by taking a selfie when the offense was taking a knee in victory formation. That won't sit well with some. In the end, this was the entire Haskins experience: You saw the arm talent, the inaccuracy, the poise and some of his youthfulness.

"I felt like our offense needed a spark," coach Mike Tomlin said. "Mason wasn't doing enough. [Devlin] came in and provided us with a spark. Made a couple plays. We'll see what next week holds."

Henry has 347 yards in two games against two of the NFL's worst run defenses. But next week against the Colts (ninth-ranked run defense) will be a major test for Henry and the Titans' rushing attack. <i>-- Turron Davenport</i></p>

It clearly hasn't, and the Jaguars' sixth consecutive road loss to the Titans may force his hand as early as Monday. Coach Doug Marrone is 19-24 in his two-plus seasons, which includes a 9-18 mark since winning the AFC South with a 10-6 record and appearing in the AFC title game in 2017. General manager Dave Caldwell and executive vice president of football operations Tom Coughlin have drafted well the past two seasons, but they are in jeopardy, too. It will depend on whether Khan trusts them to make the decisions in free agency and the upcoming draft, which includes two first-round picks. <i>-- Mike DiRocco</i></p>

But while the defense continues to define this Patriots team, with a blocked punt on special teams as an extension of that, the short-handed offense is still searching for answers. The optimistic view is <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady">Tom Brady</a> (17-of-37 for 190 yards, TD) and the offense will soon get receivers <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2579604/phillip-dorsett-ii">Phillip Dorsett II</a> (concussion) and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14922/mohamed-sanu-sr">Mohamed Sanu Sr</a>.

At 6-5, the Cowboys remain in first place in the NFC East but partly because of Philadelphia's struggles. "We're fortunate," Jones said. "We've got a chance to really step up here and do this, but I want to see us coordinate our defense, offense and special teams ... I want to see a winning game, all of those guys acting a little bit in coordination and unison. And I'm disappointed we didn't do that." <i>-- Todd Archer</i></p>

That San Francisco thoroughly dominated Green Bay should only bolster the 49ers' confidence, and it keeps them in position to lock up the No. 1 seed and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. "Everybody kind of has been sleeping on us," 49ers offensive tackle <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052885/mike-mcglinchey">Mike McGlinchey</a> said. "I don't know what else we can do to kind of say, 'Hey, we're a force to be reckoned with too.' But I think we sent that message tonight to not only the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/gb/green-bay-packers">Green Bay Packers</a> but the rest of the NFL, as well.

What's to make anyone think the Packers can come West and actually win after getting rolled in their two California games this season -- at the Chargers and at the 49ers? <i>-- Rob Demovsky</i></p>
