      <p>Heavy rain that hit the Liguria region in the northwest of Italy on Sunday caused the collapse of a segment of a motorway bridge on the A6 Torino-Savona highway, about a kilometer from the coastal city of Savona. The bridge collapsed following <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201812301071104675-us-jet-bridge-failure/">a massive landslide that hit the area</a>.</p>

      <p>No casualties had been reported, although the head of Liguria’s regional government, Giovanni Toti, said earlier on Sunday at a news conference that the collapse of the bridge <a href="https://sputniknews.com/russia/201901011071138839-moscow-bridge-collapse/">may have affected a vehicle</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>Search operations continue by several fire brigade teams who arrived at the site along with 118 personnel, traffic police, as well as technical staff from the highway and SIAS.</blockquote>

      <p>Following the collapse of the bridge, SIAS closed the highway in both directions until further notice, although only one of the two <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201903141073237555-bridge-collapses-mumbai/">separate carriageways had collapsed</a>, while the second was reported to have been unaffected by the massive landslide.</p>
      <p>Another local road in the area neighboring the motorway was also washed away by the landslide.</p>
