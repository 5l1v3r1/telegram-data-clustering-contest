      <p>Asian shares made guarded gains on Monday as investors braced for another week of likely conflicting commentary on the Sino-U.S. trade dispute, while the outperformance of recent U.S. economic data gave the dollar a leg up on its peers, according to Reuters.</p>
      <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan bounced 0.26%, after losing 0.4% last week, it said.</p>
      <p>JF Apex Securities Research said US markets rose slightly on Friday after President Trump's comments on the US-China trade deal.</p>
      <p>It said that earlier, European stocks advanced following optimism on US-China trade talks.</p>
      <p>“On the local market, the FBM KLCI gained 4.65 points to 1596.84 points.</p>
      <p>“Following the positive performances in the US and Europe, the FBM KLCI could climb towards its resistance of 1610 points,” it said.</p>
