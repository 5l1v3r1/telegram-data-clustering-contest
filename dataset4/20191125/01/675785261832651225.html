      <p>Flawless <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a> arrived on the red carpet looking incredible as fans wait to find out if she speaks out after a public row with Scooter Braun.</p>
      <p>Taylor and her former manager have been at war over rights to her hits.</p>
      <p>The megastar accused her former label manager and a prominent music industry figure of "exercising tyrannical control" over her music.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old Shake It Off singer had taken aim at Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta in a social media rant as her feud with them reached new heights.</p>

      <p>She arrived at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles in an incredible green dress, showing off her leg with the sleek number on the red carpet.</p>
      <p>Taylor may be tempted to open up on the subject on stage - never being scared of using awards to make points.</p>
