      <p>Ensenada, Mexico: North America’s most famous off-road race began yesterday just outside of Ensenada, Mexico, – a day late thanks to torrential rains that are sure to have muddied up the course with a few superstar racers pairing up to tackle the 1,287-kilometer course through Baja’s rocky roads and sandy washes.</p>
      <p>An exciting last-minute entry from two legendary off-road racers coming in from afar: reigning Dakar Rally champions, Qatari Nasser Al Attiyah and Australian Toby Price, will also be hopping in a Trophy Truck together for the first time. While the Baja 1000’s all-day, all-night style of racing will be a change for the cross-country rally experts, their driving skills will make them a force to be reckoned with. Toby will be joined by co-driver Dustin Hellstrom, and Al Attiyah by Mathieu Baumel. The pair are supported by Baja racing legend Jesse Jones.</p>
      <p>“I am so excited to do Baja 1000 – I’ve been dreaming of doing this race for a long time! With two Dakar champions, I think it will be really a nice feeling to race together,” Al Attiyah said.</p>
      <p>“I have never driven a trophy truck, so we need to test the truck. It won’t be easy at the beginning, but I think we can do a good job, and we have a good strategy.” Al-Attiyah added.</p>
      <p>“Baja in itself is a challenge, you have to expect the unexpected. Anything can happen in this race and you really need to stay calm and let it come to you.”</p>
      <p>“This race is unique by the length and the time – the crew will have to stay focused on the track. Should be less difficult on navigation as we have some recce possibility... then Nasser and I will have to find the fastest and easiest way during the race,” Price said.</p>
      <p>Baumel, Al Attiyah and Price have already agreed on one strategy – Toby will open the course on roads that he already knows, then plans on handing the truck over to superstar driver Nasser with plenty of life left in it for the race to the finish.</p>
      <p>Andy McMillin and Bryce Menzies, both of USA have always been racing against each other – but for the 2020 Baja 1000, they’re going to be on the same team – piloting the same Mason Motorsports Trophy Truck as fast as they can during this iconic off-road race – each taking a turn (or two) at the wheel as the truck races non-stop, day and night, over 1,287 kilometers.</p>
      <p>With five Baja 1000 wins to his name, Andy knows what he’s doing – and Bryce has proven himself with three Baja 500 championships, making this duo very dangerous.</p>
