      <p>There’s no question that Dwyane Wade was an absolute legend throughout his 17-year career on the hardwood. But now that he’s retired, he’s taken on a new courtside role as cheerleader.</p>
      <p>Wade’s son, Zaire, and LeBron James’ son, LeBron “Bronny” James Jr., both began their first high school seasons at Sierra Canyon this year. Their first game was broadcast on ESPN, and Wade and his wife, Gabrielle Union, were featured prominently on the sidelines.</p>
