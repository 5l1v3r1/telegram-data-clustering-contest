      <p>SYDNEY, Nov 25 — Asian shares made guarded gains today as investors braced for another week of likely conflicting commentary on the Sino-US trade dispute, while the outperformance of recent US economic data gave the dollar a leg up on its peers.</p>
      <p>MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan bounced 0.26 per cent, after losing 0.4 per cent last week.</p>
      <p>Japan’s Nikkei firmed 0.8 per cent in early trade, while Australian stocks rose 0.5 per cent. E-Mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 added 0.2 per cent.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, US national security adviser Robert O’Brien said an initial trade agreement with China is still possible by the end of the year, but warned Washington would not turn a blind eye to what happens in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>The comments add to worries that a Chinese crackdown on anti-government protests in Hong Kong could further complicate the talks.</p>
      <p>Over the weekend, pro-democracy candidates in Hong Kong romped to a landslide and symbolic majority in district council elections in the embattled city.</p>
      <p>“Markets are showing some signs of tiring of the steady drip feed of upbeat comments from US officials and no signs of a final agreement looking likely,” said Robert Rennie, head of financial market strategy at Westpac.</p>
      <p>He noted six weeks had passed since the “phase-one” deal was agreed in principle yet there was still no deal in place.</p>
      <p>“Key for markets will thus be whether the December 15 tariffs covering approximately US$156 billion (RM651.5 billion) of largely technology imports are postponed and whether a deal can be signed ahead of that date, with press suggesting that these tariffs will be delayed to give negotiators more time.”</p>
      <p>Reuters reported an ambitious “phase two” trade deal was also looking less likely, according to US and Beijing officials, lawmakers and trade experts.</p>

        <b>‘Least dirty’</b>
      </p>
      <p>In currency markets, the dollar had rallied on Friday when US manufacturing surveys beat forecasts, just as European Union numbers disappointed.</p>
      <p>“US economic data outperformed, highlighting again the resilience of the economy and that while global growth has slowed, it remains the least dirty t-shirt in the laundry basket,” said Tapas Strickland, a director of economics and markets at National Australia Bank.</p>
      <p>“For the EU data, the important takeaway was the ongoing decline in the manufacturing sector is now spreading to the larger services sector, a worrying sign for the global economy.”</p>
      <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Friday called on euro zone governments to strengthen domestic demand after a global trade war brought a decade of export-driven growth to an abrupt end.</p>
      <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks later today and is expected to underline the steady outlook for rates given the better economic figures.</p>
      <p>The euro was off at US$1.1021 today, having breached chart support at US$1.1040, while the dollar edged up to ¥108.72 (RM4.17).</p>
      <p>The dollar was steady on a basket of currencies at 98.258 , after gaining 0.3 per cent last week.</p>
      <p>Spot gold was flat at US$1,460.62 per ounce, restrained by the bounce in the dollar.</p>
      <p>Oil prices held near two-month highs helped by expectations of an extension to Opec+ production cuts.</p>
      <p>Brent crude futures firmed 19 cents to US$63.58, while US crude rose 24 cents to US$58.01 a barrel. — Reuters</p>
