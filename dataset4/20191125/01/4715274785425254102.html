      <p>In an interview with reporters Saturday, the President said he has yet to decide whether he will support the proposal of House Minority Leader Benny Abante Jr. who urged private firms to implement the shortened workweek this December as heavy traffic is expected to worsen during the holiday season.</p>
      <p>“I have to discuss it with the Cabinet. I have to discuss it with [Labor Secretary Silvestre] Bello and the rest,” President Duterte said in the interview.</p>
      <p>“I have not yet decided really. I just want to hear [their thoughts],” he added.</p>
      <p>Abante cited multinational tech giant Microsoft as an example of private firms that implemented the four-day workweek pointing out that it led to a 40-percent boost in productivity.</p>
      <p>He also called on Malacañang to study the implementation of the scheme for non-frontline offices of national government agencies.</p>
      <p>House Bills 1670 and 1904 propose an optional scheme to shorten workdays as long as employees meet the prescribed hours within the week.</p>
      <p>Filed by Deputy Speaker and Camarines Sur Rep. Luis Raymund Villafuerte and Baguio City Rep. Mark Go, the proposed measures are pending at the labor and employment committee.</p>
      <p>Labor groups have expressed concern over the proposal, saying workers will work overtime within four days that might affect their health and salary.</p>
      <p>The House committee has formed a technical working group to study the bills and come up with a proposal acceptable to both employer and labor groups.</p>
      <p>Last year, Duterte signed the Telecommuting Act, which allows employees in the private sector to work from home.</p>
      <p>The law does not require employers to establish telecommuting arrangements that would be offered to employees on a voluntary basis. </p>
