      <p>A SENIOR loyalist linked to the murder of Pat Finucane has denied being behind a contentious banner targeting the solicitor's son and his campaign for Westminster election.</p>
      <p>Jim Spence dismissed the allegations and claimed there was an effort to "contrive a game of 'finger-pointing' within loyalism".</p>
      <p>Several loyalist banners have been erected <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/generalelection/2019/11/18/news/anti-john-finucane-banners-a-hate-crime-sinn-fe-in-says-1767935/">against Sinn Féin's John Finucane</a>, while another <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/generalelection/2019/11/15/news/anti-claire-hanna-banner-put-up-in-south-belfast-1766013/">targets SDLP MLA Claire Hanna</a>.</p>
      <p>Police are examining whether the displays against the Westminster election candidates could constitute a "hate incident or hate crime".</p>

      <p>One banner off west Belfast's Shankill Road attacks Mr Finucane and his family, including his father Pat Finucane who was murdered by loyalists in 1989.</p>
      <p>Loyalist sources told the Sunday Life that Mr Spence ordered the display of this banner at the corner of Mayo Street.</p>

      <p>Speaking to loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson on the Unionist Voice website, Mr Spence denied the claim.</p>
      <p>"I am not behind the banners, nor is any one section of loyalism as far as I am aware," he said.</p>
      <p>"It was Jamie Bryson being blamed during the week, now it is me. It appears there is a republican-driven agenda to create a bogeyman, or to contrive a game of 'finger-pointing' within loyalism."</p>

      <p>Last week Mr Bryson also <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/21/news/jamie-bryson-denies-involvement-in-banners-targeting-sinn-fe-in-s-john-finucane-1770944/">denied being behind the contentious banners</a>, saying the allegation was "absolute nonsense".</p>
      <p>Mr Spence defended the banners and criticised the media, saying that he was "not going to condemn any loyalist that challenges Sinn Féin's attempts to re-write the past".</p>

      <p>A senior UDA figure during the Troubles, Mr Spence has previously been accused of having been an informant.</p>
      <p>The loyalist was linked to the murder of Pat Finucane by Ken Barrett, a UDA gunman convicted over the killing.</p>
      <p>He told detectives that Mr Spence said the killing "had to be done" and was able to have RUC checkpoints removed so loyalist gunmen could travel freely.</p>
      <p>Mr Spence told Unionist Voice the allegations were "erroneous" and "laughable".</p>
      <p>"I deny all of the allegations, and indeed despite one of the most expensive and extensive criminal investigations in history, I have never been charged with any offence relating to that particular incident," he said.</p>
      <p>The row over the banners, which include offensive and false allegations, comes amid tensions over tight election races in two Belfast constituencies.</p>
      <p>Mr Finucane is hoping to take the North Belfast seat from DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, while Ms Hanna is vying to unseat the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly in South Belfast.</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin branded the Unionist Voice article's claim that the media is being 'wheeled out' by the party's press office as "baseless and absolutely ludicrous".</p>
      <p>A party spokesman said: "What is uncontestable is that loyalists have been engaged in a campaign of demonisation and vilification against John Finucane and his family over the duration of the current North Belfast election campaign in a desperate effort to assist the DUP.</p>
      <p>"The banners erected in loyalist areas over recent weeks attacking the Finucane family are about promoting hatred and division and are an attack on the democratic process."</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin said it continues to support the Finucane family's campaign for a "fully independent public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane".</p>
