      <p>The Lagos State Commissioner of Police Olusegun Odumosu has directed the state Environmental and Special Offences Agency to clamp down on all violators of the state environmental laws, especially those impeding the free flow of traffic across the state.</p>
      <p>In obedience to the directive, the enforcement team  Agency at the weekend, cleared the entire Ikeja GRA, Mopol 20 Barracks and surroundings of the Lagos Police Command of illegal traders, Vulcanizers, illegal beer parlours, block moulders, Okada riders, abandoned/accident vehicles and illegal tricycle operators.</p>

      <p>He stressed that the directive also empowered the Agency to clear all illegal traders, abandoned vehicles, roadside mechanics, miscreants, Okada and other activities constituting environmental nuisance across the state.</p>
      <p>Egbeyemi noted that with many ongoing road rehabilitation projects across the state, there was an urgent need to create a free flow of traffic for motorists by clearing all obstructions on Lagos roads.</p>
      <p>The Chairman, therefore, urged all illegal traders, roadside mechanics, Iron benders and owners of abandoned vehicles particularly those around Police Stations to vacate them immediately as anyone caught during the enforcement would be severely dealt with in accordance with the law.</p>
      <p>According to him “The directive is to be jointly carried out with Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC) and the Lagos State Neighbourhood Safety Corps”, adding that areas to be covered during the enforcement, operations include Igando, Ikorodu, Ajah, Mile 2, Obalende, Oyingbo, Dopemu, Iyana-Ipaja, Agege, Ojota, Idimu, Yaba, Ikate-Elegushi, Apple Junction (Festac), Bogije area and Mushin”</p>
      <p>He commended the new Commissioner of Police on his directive to all Divisional Police Officers to support the Agency’s clampdown on illegal commercial motorcycle operators, especially those plying restricted routes including highways and bridges across the State.</p>
      <p>Egbeyemi, however, enjoined members of the public to support the Agency by providing useful security information about criminal activities around them to security agencies through the Lagos State free Emergency Toll Lines 112 &amp; 767.</p>
