      <p>A 41-year-old man charged with manslaughter following the death of another man in Creswick on Sunday morning has appeared at the Ballarat Magistrates' Court.</p>
      <p>Shane Andrew Lucas, of Creswick, has been remanded in custody until a committal hearing on March 5.</p>
      <p>He is facing one charge of manslaughter for allegedly killing <a href="http://www.thecourier.com.au/story/6507725/lost-for-words-rest-easy-tributes-for-tender-after-alleged-pub-altercation/?cs=12">Creswick man David Blake</a>.</p>
      <p>Magistrate Letizia Torres told the court police must hand all prosecution evidence to Lucas' defence team by January 16.</p>
      <p>Police prosecutor Senior Constable Steve Repac initially requested longer than the regular six-week timeline to present prosecution evidence to the defence, saying he expected the investigation would be 'significant'.</p>
      <p>A Ballarat defence lawyer, speaking on behalf of Lucas's defence lawyer Theo Magazis, opposed this extension.</p>
      <p>Ms Torres said she was inclined to keep the timeline for prosecution evidence to be provided to six weeks.</p>
      <p>Lucas, wearing a grey t-shirt, wiped his eyes a number of times while in court.</p>
      <p>He did not make an application for bail and will appear by video link at the Ballarat Magistrates' Court for a committal mention on March 5.</p>
