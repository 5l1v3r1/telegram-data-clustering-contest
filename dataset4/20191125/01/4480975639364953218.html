      <p>EUR/JPY is currently trading at 119.90, higher by 0.17% having travelled between 119.65 and 119.92 on firmer risk tones where financial markets were buoyed going into the weekend with US PMI's contrasting with the Eurozone flash Nov PMIs disappointment.</p>
      <h3>Global PMIs mixed to improving, raising hopes of a turnaround</h3>
      <p>Manufacturing was encouraging but still weak at 46.6 (est. 46.4, prior 45.9), and services fell to 51.5 (est. 52.4, prior 52.2), to underscore the vulnerability of the region – The preliminary read of the Markit euro area and German PMI figures depicted an economy running below trend. Meanwhile, US <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">Manufacturing PMI</a> rose to 52.2 in November, a seven-month high, from 51.3 in October which was the third successive rise in the index indicating a slowdown in the US manufacturing sector may be bottoming out. Subsequently, US equity markets were up with the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA up 0.2% and 0.4% respectively at the close. The DAX was higher by 0.2% and the FTSE 100 added 1.2%.</p>
      <h3>EUR/JPY catching up with risk appetite </h3>
      <p>

        </a>
      </p>
      <p>However, there was a lag in the cross, with EUR/JPY unable to rally and was, in fact, losing around 0.5% into the close. EUR/JPY has finally corrected amid the weekend headlines which compliment President Trump's statements and Chinese rhetoric that a phase-one trade deal was on the cards. Weekend headlines, in Bloomberg news, notes a trade deal compromise with the Chinese raising penalties for IP theft. We also had news of a landslide victory for the Pro-democracy candidates in Hong Kong – <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/events/brexit">Brexit</a> headlines have also been positive for risk <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a> with the Tory party in the lead in the polls. <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment/risk-appetite">Risk appetite</a> has reacted in kind and hence EUR/JPY has picked up the bid. </p>
