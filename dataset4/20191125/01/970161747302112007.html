        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lizzo/">Lizzo</a> was surprisingly outshone on the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/american-music-awards/">American Music Awards</a> red carpet, after arriving at the bash carrying what is possibly the world’s smallest handbag.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Joining some of music’s biggest stars on Sunday, the Truth Hurts singer strutted along the red carpet in a pretty ruffled one-shoulder minidress, but even the bright orange hue wasn’t enough to distract from her unusual accessory.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old casually posed on the red carpet at Los Angeles’ Microsoft Theatre holding up a tiny white handbag between her fingers.</p>
      <p>While it may be small in appearance, the teeny purse was designed by a fashion powerhouse courtesy of Valentino.</p>
      <p>So what can Lizzo’s tiny bag fit exactly? Her phone? Lipstick? Snacks for the show?</p>
      <p>Nope, none of the above but something much better.</p>
      <p>‘@maisonvalentino Bag big enough for my f***s to give. Big body b***h in a Valentin-HO custom look for @amas.’</p>

      <p>Ariana Grande gave the teeny accessory her seal of approval and commented on Instagram: ‘Cutest.’</p>
      <p>During her red carpet interview, Lizzo revealed there are only three of the little handbags in the world but they’ll no doubt be snapped up sharpish after tonight.</p>
      <p>As for what she packed for the evening, the singer joked: ‘I got tampons in here, a flask of tequila, condoms.’</p>
      <p>All the essentials, then.</p>
      <p>Lizzo, real name Melissa Jefferson, will be hoping to bag one of the three awards she’s nominated for, which are: best new artist, soul/R&amp;B song of the year and soul/R&amp;B female artist of the year.</p>
      <p>Last week, the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/lizzo-billie-eilish-taylor-swift-among-stars-leading-grammy-2020-nominations-11188592/">Juice singer earned eight Grammy nominations</a> including song of the year for Truth Hurts and album of the year for Cuz I Love You.</p>
      <p>It’s been a stellar year for Lizzo who spent seven weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with Truth Hurts, which became one of the longest-running chart-toppers by a solo female rapper.</p>
