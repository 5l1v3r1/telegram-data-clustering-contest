      <p>A BOOK examining the deaths of children during the Troubles has won a prestigious literary award.</p>
      <p>Children of the Troubles, written by broadcaster Joe Duffy and journalist Freya McClements, received the Best Irish-published Book of the Year prize at the Irish Book Awards.</p>
      <p>The authors dedicated their award to the 186 children killed during north's conflict.</p>
      <p>Children of the Troubles: The Untold Story of the Children Killed in the Northern Ireland Conflict is based on original interviews with almost 100 families and extensive archival research.</p>
      <p>The book includes children who were not previously publicly acknowledged as Troubles victims.</p>
      <p>More than 115,000 votes were cast by the public to select the winners in each category at the awards show, which was hosted by Miriam O'Callaghan and Evelyn O'Rourke.</p>
      <p>The awards ceremony was held last Wednesday night in Dublin's Convention Centre and highlights were aired on RTÃ‰ One at the weekend.</p>
      <p>Posting a picture of their award on Twitter, Ms McClements said: "Honoured and delighted that Children of the Troubles has been recognised as Best Irish-published Book of the Year at the Irish Book Awards."</p>
      <p>She said it was dedicated to memory of the children in the book and expressed her "heartfelt thanks to their families".</p>
