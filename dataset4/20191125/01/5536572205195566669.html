      <h1>Browns DL Sheldon Richardson Implies Mason Rudolph is A Bad QB, Wants Him To Play Next Week</h1>

      <p>Cleveland Browns defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson is lobbying for Mason Rudolph to play next week.</p>
      <p>During Week 12, the Pittsburgh Steelers QB was benched after struggling against the Cincinnati Bengals, which brought in Devlin Hodges who threw for more yards in less attempts as well as a touchdown that would prove to be the game winner.</p>
      <blockquote>“I don’t really care, bro,” Richardson told reporters Sunday when alerted of Rudolph’s removal against the winless Cincinnati Bengals, according to NFL Network’s Kimberley Jones. “I hope he plays.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>When asked why, Richardson responded, “Did you see him last game?”</blockquote>
      <p>During the Browns-Steelers Week 11 contest, Rudolph threw four interceptions as Cleveland won 21-7. With just seconds to play in that game, the Browns would lose Myles Garrett for the season after he ripped Rudolph’s helmet off and struck him with it, leading to a lengthy suspension from the NFL.</p>
      <p>Thirty-three players were fined for their involvement in the brawl, but Richardson wasn’t one of them.</p>
