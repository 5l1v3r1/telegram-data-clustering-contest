      <h1>Jackpot! Lottery tickets on sale for 1st time in Mississippi</h1>

      <p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi residents don’t have to leave the state to buy lottery tickets anymore.</p>
      <p>Tickets go on sale Monday. The tickets will be available in roughly 1,200 convenience stores and other sites.</p>
      <p>For decades Mississippi was one of only six states without a lottery. There was strong opposition from politically powerful churches.</p>
      <p>But the state’s lack of money for road maintenance changed that.</p>
      <p>In 2018, lawmakers authorized a lottery as the state was forced to close hundreds of unsafe bridges. The first $80 million a year from lottery revenue will go to highways, then the rest goes to education.</p>
      <p>Democratic state Rep. Alyce Clarke of Jackson will buy the ceremonial first ticket Monday morning at a convenience store in south Jackson.</p>
      <p>She’s advocated for a lottery for years.</p>
