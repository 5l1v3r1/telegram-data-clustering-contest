      <h1>ASX 200 lunch update: Afterpay higher, Nufarm &amp; Westpac tumble</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:01:48+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/jamesmickleboro/" target="_blank">James Mickleboro</a></address>
      <p>At lunch on Monday the S&amp;P/ASX 200 index is on course to start the week on a positive note. The benchmark index is up 0.55% to 6,746.3 points at the time of writing.</p>
      <p>Here’s what has been happening on the market today:</p>
      <h3>Afterpay shares surge higher.</h3>
      <p>The<b> Afterpay Touch Group Ltd</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Afterpay+Touch+Group+Ltd/?ticker=ASX-APT">(ASX: APT)</a> share price is rocketing higher on Monday after providing the results and recommendations of its <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/25/afterpay-share-price-storms-higher-on-austrac-audit-update/">AML/CTF final audit</a>. While the report notes historical non-compliance by Afterpay and makes six recommendations, the majority of these matters have now been addressed.</p>
      <h3>Westpac shares fall again.</h3>
      <p>The <b>Westpac Banking Corp</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Westpac+Banking+Corp/?ticker=ASX-WBC">(ASX: WBC)</a> share price is down almost 1% on Monday after providing its <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/25/nufarm-shares-under-pressure-after-half-year-earnings-downgrade/">response plan</a> to the AUSTRAC scandal. Westpac’s chairman, Lindsay Maxsted, released a plan which includes a comprehensive set of actions across three areas. These include immediate fixes, lifting its standards, and protecting people. These commitments will increase expenses by up to $80 million (pre-tax) in FY 2020.</p>
      <h3>Nufarm accounting error.</h3>
      <p>The <b>Nufarm Limited</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Nufarm+Limited/?ticker=ASX-NUF">(ASX: NUF)</a> share price is crashing lower on Monday after <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/25/nufarm-shares-under-pressure-after-half-year-earnings-downgrade/">revealing</a> a costly accounting error. While reconciling accounts with German customers for the 2019 calendar year, Nufarm identified additional sales rebate claims from customers. This is expected to result in a $9 million impact to its first half EBITDA. In addition to this, it has warned that trading conditions have been very difficult in FY 2020.</p>
      <h3>Best and worst performers.</h3>
      <p>The <b>Afterpay</b> share price is the best performer on the ASX 200 at lunch with a 9% gain. Investors have been buying its shares following a favourable audit update. The next best performer is the <b>Caltex Australia Limited</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Caltex+Australia+Limited/?ticker=ASX-CTX">(ASX: CTX)</a> share price with a 6% gain. This morning it announced plans to spin off some of its property assets. The worst performer on the index on Monday by some distance is the <b>Nufarm</b> share price with a whopping 18% decline.</p>
