      <h3>Hazard warning ahead for PSG</h3>
      <p><b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/231388/Kylian-Mbapp%C3%A9">Kylian Mbappe</a>'s</b> list of admirers grows longer by the week. First, more than 40 ESPN FC experts from around the world ranked the French star as <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog-espn-fc-united/story/3990866/espn-fc-100-liverpoolman-city-dominate-our-ranking-of-worlds-best-soccer-players">the No. 3 forward in the ESPN FC 100</a>, and now Belgian star <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/101390/Eden-Hazard">Eden Hazard</a> has joined Mbappe's growing legion of fans.</p>
      <p>The Real Madrid star admits that he's a big fan of PSG's prize asset and, in an interview with <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/football/psg/real-psg-si-demain-je-peux-faire-venir-mbappe-les-confidences-d-eden-hazard-24-11-2019-8200728.php">Le Parisien</a>, Hazard even suggested that if he could help the move happen by tempting Mbappe to join him, he would do it.</p>
      <p>Hazard's boss Zinedine Zidane has made no secret of his desire to bring the sensational Frenchman to the Spanish capital to line up alongside Hazard, although the <i>Los Blancos</i> supremo also knows it would probably take a very high fee, perhaps a record deal, to do so.</p>
      <p>Mbappe is contracted to the Parisiens until 2022 but has openly admitted he is up for a new challenge, and Real are one of few clubs who would be able to afford to land one of football's hottest properties.</p>
      <p>Still, Hazard whispering sweet nothings in Mbappe's direction isn't going to hurt.</p>

      <h3>Umtiti doesn't rule out Lyon return, denting Arsenal's chances</h3>
      <p><b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/150051/Samuel-Umtiti">Samuel Umtiti</a> </b>isn't ruling out a dramatic return to boyhood club Lyon, <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/umtiti-i-wouldnt-rule-out-returning-to-olympique-lyon-in-the-future-7749386">Sport</a> reports.</p>
      <p>A homecoming for Umtiti would effectively end Arsenal's hopes of signing the highly rated defender, who is currently tied down to a long-term deal at Barcelona.</p>
      <p>The Spanish publication quotes the French international as saying: "Returning to Lyon is a possibility, as a player or as a coach."</p>
      <p>Umtiti played for the Ligue 1 side for five years before joining Barcelona in 2016.</p>
      <h3>Tap-ins</h3>
      <p>- The Liverpool hierarchy have given <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/255765/Rhian-Brewster">Rhian Brewster</a></b> the green light to depart on loan, according to the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/liverpool-sanction-rhian-brewster-loan-20951160">Daily Star</a>.</p>
      <p>In addition to Aston Villa's interest, the paper claims that the 19-year-old is being targeted by the likes of Swansea, Leeds United and Crystal Palace, after failing to make a single Premier League appearance so far this season.</p>
      <p>- <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/101471/Carlos-S%C3%A1nchez">Carlos Sanchez</a> </b>could be headed for a January exit from West Ham, after making just a handful of Premier league appearances this season, according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7720187/West-Ham-offload-experienced-Colombia-midfielder-Carlos-Sanchez-cut-price-sale-loan-deal.html">Daily Mail</a>.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old, who has been capped 82 times by Colombia, featured in the final half-hour of West Ham's 3-2 home defeat to Tottenham yesterday -- his first outing for the club since a trio of appearances from the bench in August.</p>
      <p>- Juventus are keeping tabs on Swedish starlet <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/272695/Dejan-Kulusevski">Dejan Kulusevski</a></b>, with sporting director Fabio Paratici watching him in action for Parma against Bologna this weekend. That is according to <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/en/news/exclusive-paratici-studies-kulusevski-juve-s-plan-for-the-swedis-83723">Calciomercato</a>, who also say Inter are monitoring the €30 million target.</p>
