        <b>It was hard to miss Selena Gomez at the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/american-music-awards/">American Music Awards</a> 2019, as she arrived in a bright neon minidress ready for all the action.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Hands To Myself singer was looking all kinds of fierce in the neon green dress complimented with a sharp brunette bob, as she arrived at the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Before striking a pose, Selena proved herself to be a woman of the people and sweetly took some time to pose for photos with her adoring fans. The popstar pouted and smiled for photos as fans promptly whipped out their phones for selfies.</p>
      <p>It should be an interesting night for Selena, 27, who will on-hand to support her bestie <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a> in the midst of the popstar’s feud with Scooter Braun.</p>
      <p>Taylor, 29, had claimed she was banned from performing her old songs at the AMAs due to Scooter and Scott Borchetta purchasing the rights to her back catalogue when they took over Big Machine Records.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>However, the record label execs insisted Taylor was free to perform her music which led to her confirming her performance would go ahead.</p>

      <p>‘My heart is so heavy right now. It makes me sick and extremely angry. (I don’t mind if there may be retaliation) this is my opinion,’ Selena wrote last week.</p>
      <p>‘It’s greed, manipulation and power. There is no heart or thought of anyone elses [sic]. No respect for the words my friend has written since she was a 14 year old in her bedroom.</p>
      <p>‘You’ve robbed and crushed one of our best song writers of our time an opportunity to celebrate all of her music with fans and the world.’</p>

      <p>Selena added: ‘I have known Taylor for 13 years. She is the most dedicated, fearless, feisty, strongest woman I’ve ever known. People can say b***h but what I’m saying to you is that’s called a woman with true identity and strength who takes no s***.</p>
      <p>‘I listed to Fearless before it came out and I just remember us jumping on a bed and she was just sparkling. So proud of her diary being read by the whole world. Nervous of people not liking it… but that became one of the biggest records- an album that saved so many young wom[e]n who felt alone. Have a broken heart.’</p>

      <p>Selena later added: ‘See my best friend (or any of my friends) be constantly pulled down is the worst feeling. Taylor fights. She will never stop fighting. People grow from choices. Some will stay exactly the same. I just want a change of heart. I love you.’</p>
      <p>No doubt Selena will be cheering from the front row.</p>
