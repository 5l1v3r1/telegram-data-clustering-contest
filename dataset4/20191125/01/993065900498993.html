      <p>ONE of the north's largest house building firms, Hagan Homes, says a new £1m project in Lisburn has created 25 construction jobs.</p>
      <p>Building of the six three-bedroom semi-detached homes on the Wallace Gate site started in September 2019.</p>
      <p>The Ballyclare-based firm will complete the first homes by February 2020, with the overall development scheduled to be handed over by July 2020. House prices will start from £170,000.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Banbridge-based property group Lotus Homes has notified Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council of its plans to build 90 houses in Antrim.</p>
      <p>A pre-planning notice was lodged with the council on Wednesday. The bid includes 90 dwellings with detached garages.</p>
      <p>The proposal would effectively double the size of the Co Down group's existing development next to the Holiday Inn Express hotel on the Ballymena Road in the town.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the Lisburn development, Jim Burke, director of sales and Acquisitions at Hagan Homes said: “The demand for superior homes in Northern Ireland, which offer value for money, remains extremely high.</p>
      <p>“Hagan Homes build affordable, quality, stylish homes and we are renowned for our attention to detail and the emphasis we place on the finer details both internally and externally.”</p>
      <p>Hagan Homes' main contractor for the Wallace Gate development is MCA Building and Joinery Contractors.</p>
