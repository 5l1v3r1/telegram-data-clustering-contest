      <h1>Son of Woodman 'the kingmaker' met Treasurer Tim Pallas: phone taps</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:04:36+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:04</time> by <a rel="author">Royce Millar</a></address>
      <p>Victorian treasurer Tim Pallas has been drawn into the anti-corruption commission's hearing on Casey council, with phone intercepts revealing companies linked to developer John Woodman met with Mr Pallas and fellow frontbencher Luke Donnellan to put their case about major development projects.</p>
      <p>In one intercepted telephone call Mr Woodman’s son Heath, also a developer, told Mr Woodman about the “balltearer” meeting that he had with Pallas who, he says, was positive about Woodman-related projects.</p>

      <p>It is unclear whether the meeting included discussion of the contentious proposal to rezone a large property at Cranbourne West from industrial to residential that would net $100 million for the landowner Leighton and Mr Woodman as its consultant.</p>
      <p>No decision has yet been made on the rezoning but on the weekend <i>The Sunday Age </i>revealed that Mr Woodman believed in 2015 that he had been given an assurance the Andrews government approve the rezoning.</p>
      <p>Mr Tovey stressed that in its thorough investigation, IBAC had found no wrongdoing by any senior government member. However he said it seemed Mr Woodman had “undue access” through the hundreds of thousands of dollars he showered on both parties in gifts and donations.</p>
      <p>The meeting with Mr Pallas appears to have occurred well after the Mr Woodman emailed associates reminding them of <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53dfj.html">an agreement with State Labor about the rezoning</a>.</p>

      <p>The developer at the centre of the Casey land deals scandal played a key role in deciding who became mayor in the south-eastern municipality, public hearings by the anti-corruption commission heard today.</p>
      <p>Planner-developer John Woodman also paid for special care at the disability service attended by a councillor’s son as the councillor was seeking to become mayor.</p>
      <p>Michael Tovey QC, the counsel assisting the Victorian anti-corruption commission’s hearings into allegedly crook planning at Casey council this morning detailed Mr Woodman’s role in influencing who was to be mayor and described him as a Casey "kingmaker”.</p>
      <p>In his fifth day as the key witness at public hearings, Mr Woodman disputed the description but confirmed playing a role. He said his close interests in local politics at Casey and other municipalities was “standard” for developers seeking planning approvals in Victoria.</p>

      <p>Mr Tovey also detailed the apparent manipulation of council business by Mr Woodman and his planning consultant Megan Schutz, which included the “scripting" of council motions, especially for former mayor Cr Sam Aziz.</p>
      <p>Mr Woodman confirmed that he provided funds to Blairlogie Living and Learning, a supported accommodation service in Cranbourne South, where the son of Councillor Amanda Stapledon attended.</p>
      <p>The public examination heard how Mr Woodman, a director of planning one-stop shop Watsons Pty Ltd, met Cr Amanda Stapledon at an East Malvern restaurant where they discussed the councillor’s bid for the Casey mayoralty. This appeared to be a reference to Cr Stapledon’s push for the mayoralty she won in October 2018.</p>
      <p>Mr Woodman confirmed that he had supported Cr Stapledon’s mayoral campaign after also financially backing her ultimately unsuccessful campaign for the Liberal Party for state parliament in 2014.</p>

      <p>Mr Woodman said it was unclear if Cr Stapledon had declared his support of aftercare support for her son at Blairlogie. While Cr Stapledon has declared Mr Woodman’s donation for the 2014 state election, it is doubtful that she declared the developer’s support for her mayoral bid.</p>
      <p>The Woodman-linked development company Wolfdene has long been a major sponsor of the Blairlogie service through its charitable Wolfdene Foundation.</p>
      <p>In its annual report from 2016 and 2017, Blairlogie also notes the many years of help from Ms Schutz, who has played a key role in big development projects at Casey.</p>
      <p>Cr Stapledon was mayor for the year to October 2019. It was her second term in the position. She has not responded to a string of recent queries from <i>The Age</i> about issues raised in the IBAC hearings.</p>
