      <p>A senior Australian politician said he was disturbed by the reported efforts of China to infiltrate politics in Australia, Hong Kong and Taiwan as detailed by an asylum seeker who said he was a Chinese spy.</p>
      <p>“These are very disturbing reports,” Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Saturday, adding that government law agencies were dealing with the matter.</p>
      <p>The defector, named as Wang “William” Liqiang by the Age newspaper, gave a sworn statement to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO), identifying China’s senior military intelligence officers in Hong Kong, the newspaper said.</p>
      <p>He has also purportedly revealed details of how China funds and conducts political interference in Taiwan and Australia, the Age reported.</p>
      <p>Police in China’s financial hub of Shanghai, responding to the Australian report, said Wang was a 26-year-old unemployed man from the eastern province of Fujian and was wanted in connection with a fraud case.</p>
      <p>On April 10, he went to Hong Kong carrying a fraudulent Chinese passport and Hong Kong permanent residency card, they added in a brief statement.</p>
      <p>Wang had previously been convicted of fraud in 2016 in Fujian, Shanghai police said.</p>
      <p>Reuters reported before Australia’s election in May that Australian intelligence had determined China was responsible for a cyberattack on its national parliament and three largest political parties. China denies the accusations.</p>
      <p>Wang said he was a part of an intelligence operation within a Hong Kong-listed company that infiltrated universities and media, the Age said.</p>
      <p>“I have personally been involved and participated in a series of espionage activities,” it cited Wang as saying in his October statement to the intelligence agency.</p>
      <p>Wang said he helped guide positive media attention toward certain Taiwanese politicians, including President Tsai Ing-wen’s main opponent, Han Kuo-yu of the China-friendly Kuomintang party.</p>
      <p>Han said that he would drop out if it was shown that he had taken money from China’s Communist Party.</p>
      <p>He urged the government to immediately send a team to Australia to investigate.</p>
      <p>Taiwan’s presidential office said the government was investigating. A spokeswoman for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party called the information in Australian media a reminder of the threat from China.</p>
      <p>“Whether it is the Chinese internet army or the Chinese government, it is using the democratic system of Taiwan to infringe upon our democracy,” Lee Yen-jong said.</p>
      <p>Wang also gave Australia details of the kidnapping of a Hong Kong bookseller taken to the mainland and interrogated on suspicion of selling dissident materials, the paper said. <b><i>Reuters</i></b></p>
