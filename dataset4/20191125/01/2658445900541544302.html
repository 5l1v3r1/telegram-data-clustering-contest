      <p>Special Adviser on Housing to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Mrs Benson-Awoyinka has urged tenants in Lagos to engage the services of registered estate agents, to reduce incessant frictions between landlords and tenants .</p>
      <p>She said the government was doing everything possible to ensure that landlords and tenants lived in peace by following the rules and regulations.</p>
      <p>Mrs Benson-Awoyinka advised that property owners and tenants should make use of agents and lawyers who are registered with the Lagos State Real Estate Transaction Department (LASRETRAD).</p>
      <p>She said registered agents are listed on LASRETRAD website, noting this would avoid misunderstanding in the process of a property lease or rent.</p>

      <p>According to the Special Adviser, it may be difficult for the government to resolve disputed transactions except for landlords and tenants pass through proper channels.</p>
      <p>Benson-Awoyinka who addressed reporters on cases of tenants and landlords dragging themselves over tenancy issue, said the government would ensure better housing conditions.</p>
      <p>Mrs Benson-Awoyinka said: “When renting out your property you must know the kind of the agreement you sign with the tenant, you don’t just give out your property because you are in need of money, the agent that brought that person must first be a registered agent, ensure the tenant has a guarantor.</p>
      <p>“But, in most cases, problems arise because the landlords do not want to pay the lawyer or the registered agent to handle the matter for them, a registered agent or lawyer will always know what to do.</p>
