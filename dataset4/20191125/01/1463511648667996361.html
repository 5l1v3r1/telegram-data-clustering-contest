      <h1>Aribo inspires Rangers win</h1>

      <p>After making his home debut in Nigeria’s win over Benin, Joe Aribo was back in Rangers shirt as he helped the Gers to a 3-1 victory over Hamilton Academical on Sunday.</p>
      <p>With Celtic winning on Saturday, the pressure was on Joe Aribo and his teammates to pick up the maximum points against a side that have won just twice in the Scottish top flight this season.</p>
      <p>And they did just start although it was not as easy as the scoreline suggests.</p>
      <p>Steven Gerrard’s side got off to a perfect start as Ryan Jack put them ahead in the seventh minute.</p>
      <p>However, the lead will not last long as Lewis Smith put Hamilton back on levelled terms in the 14th minute.</p>
      <p>But Rangers were determined to take away the three points from New Douglas Park.</p>
      <p>Two minutes from half-time, former Liverpool winger, Ryan Kent, scored the winner with a brilliant hit that found the top corner.</p>
      <p>Kent then ensured the points were safe as he scored his second and Rangers third of the game in the 90th minute.</p>
      <p>Aribo was on for 77 minutes before he was taken off for Steven Davis.</p>
      <p>With the win, Rangers remain second, level on points with Celtic who lead the table due to their superior goal difference.</p>
      <p>Up next for Aribo and his Rangers side is a Europa League encounter against Swiss side, Feyenoord on Thursday.</p>
