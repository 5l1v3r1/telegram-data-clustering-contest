      <p>One person died Saturday night in a fire at the Rossmoor retirement community in Walnut Creek, authorities said.</p>
      <p>The fire erupted in an eight-unit residential building around 6:20 p.m. Firefighters contained the blaze to a single unit, but smoke and water damage also displaced at least four residents of three neighboring apartments.</p>

      <p>The person who died was not immediately identified, and the cause of the fire is being investigated by the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District, Fire Marshal Chris Bachman said Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Investigators are still looking into that,” Bachman said.</p>
      <p>About 9,200 people reside at Rossmoor, a gated community 2 miles from downtown Walnut Creek. It includes condos, single-family homes and other housing options across 1,800 acres, according to its website.</p>
