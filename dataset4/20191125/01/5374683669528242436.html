      <h1>Report: Deputy Qatari envoy enters Gaza</h1>
      <h2>Deputy Qatari envoy reportedly expected to transfer funds to needy residents in Gaza.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:08:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:08</time> by <a rel="author">Elad Benari</a></address>
      <p>Palestinian Arab sources reported on Sunday evening that deputy Qatari envoy Khaled al-Hardan had entered the Gaza Strip.</p>
      <p>He is reportedly expected to transfer $7.5 million to needy residents in Gaza as part of the monthly grant that Qatar provides to the Strip with Israel’s permission.</p>
      <p>Israel has previously <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/255833">allowed several installments</a> of $15 million in Qatari money to enter Gaza. The money was to have been distributed in six installments, but Israel postponed the third following the shooting of an IDF soldier by a terrorist from Gaza.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and the Security Cabinet subsequently <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/258103">approved the transfer</a> of the third installment, but Hamas <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/258104">refused to accept the money</a> “in response to the occupation policy”.</p>
      <p>Following criticism over the Qatari money going to Hamas, <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/258179">the Qatari envoy announced</a> his country will no longer fund salaries of Hamas employees in Gaza and would instead donate the remaining $60 million in aid mostly through United Nations programs.</p>
      <p>In August, the envoy, Mohammed al-Emadi, said that the Gulf emirate's hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Gaza and its contacts with both Hamas and Israel <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/267853">are helping prevent another catastrophic war</a>.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, however, the Lebanese newspaper <i>Al-Akhbar</i> reported that Qatar <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271107">will cease providing funding</a> to Hamas in 2020.</p>
