      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/lizzo/">Lizzo</a> recently posted a photo on her Instagram page of her latest awards show look.</p>
      <p>The “Truth Hurts” songstress posed on the red carpet wearing a neon orange dress by Valentino. In the photo, Lizzo is staring at the camera as the dress is put on full display. Her dress is covered in ruffles, with one side of the dress being sleeveless. The dress stops at Lizzo’s thighs and covers the top half of the singer’s body.</p>
      <p>Lizzo opted to continue with the fun, bright theme of the fashion look in her hair and makeup. In the photo, she is seen wearing her hair in a sleek ponytail. The back of the ponytail has flipped curls in them, which is styled in different layers. Lizzo also opted to add in a slick bang, which is placed over her forehead. For her makeup, Lizzo also went with bright colors for her face. Her makeup look begins with a matte foundation, followed by a highlighter, orange eyeshadow, light eyeliner and lip gloss.</p>
      <p>For accessories, Lizzo decided to add in white earrings, which she zooms in on in her post. The earrings are mismatched, with her left one being a white hoop and another one being a longer, teardrop earring. She is also rocking a tiny purse on the red carpet. In her Instagram post, she has zoomed in on the purse, which is less than the size of one of her fingers. Lizzo is also wearing rhinestone acrylic nails and showed them off in one of her slides.</p>

She also shared that there’s “only three in the world” of the tiny designer bags.</p>
