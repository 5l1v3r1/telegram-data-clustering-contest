      <h1>The X-Misses: Christmas music to sing to and rage by</h1>

      <p>Back in 2010, I did <a href="https://boingboing.net/2010/06/14/pillow-armys-happy--.html">book-tour appearance in Seattle with a great indie band</a> called "Pillow Army," whose music I'm still listening to today; in 2013, Pillow Army's frontman Tim Franklin had <a href="https://boingboing.net/2013/12/25/atheist-christmas-carol-there.html">started recording angry, atheist Christmas carols</a> and now he's got a whole band devoted to the genre: <a href="https://xmisses.bandcamp.com/">The X-Misses</a>, whose music is a mix of funny, angry, noisy, and singable new Christmas music that makes for a great complement to other nontraditional seasonal music like DJ Riko's <a href="https://boingboing.net/?s=%22merry%20mixmas%22">Merry Mixmas</a> mashups. You can buy the album <a href="https://xmisses.bandcamp.com/album/christmas-reminiscences">Christmas Reminiscences</a> as a download, or get the whole vinyl album along with a download card that's hole-punched so you can hang it as a Christmas tree ornament. (<i>Thanks, Tim!</i>)</p>
