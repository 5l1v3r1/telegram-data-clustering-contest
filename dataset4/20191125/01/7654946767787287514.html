      <h1>Critics: Al Sharpton, Corey Johnson holding up menthol-cig ban</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:15:59+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:15</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Calder</a></address>
      <p>When the Rev. Al Sharpton calls, City Council Speaker Corey Johnson apparently listens.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/13/city-councils-push-to-ban-menthol-cigarette-sales-is-gaining-support/">A bill to ban menthol-cigarette sales</a> in the city has garnered overwhelming support in the council, yet Johnson refuses to bring it to a vote on the floor — because of concerns pushed by the Rev. Al Sharpton, whose organization rakes in dough from the top-selling US menthol-cigarette manufacturer.</p>
      <p>Sharpton and his powerful National Action Network have lobbied that a menthol ban could potentially lead to more black residents being harassed by cops for possessing illegal cigarettes.</p>
      <p>But Sharpton critics note that NAN has a history of receiving big-bucks donations from R.J. Reynolds, which owns Newport, the top-selling menthol cigarette in the nation.</p>
      <p>Critics say the NAN-R.J. Reynolds connection is deeply troubling and that Johnson — who acknowledges he’s met with Sharpton to discuss the council bill — needs to consider the proposed legislation on its health-related merits, rather than the activist’s political clout.</p>
      <p>Assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte (D-Brooklyn) <a href="https://twitter.com/AMBichotte/status/1197929651701788674">tweeted Friday</a> that opposition to a menthol-cigarette ban deserves a serious look by state Attorney General Letitia James.</p>
      <p>“Disappointed in our civil rights leader @TheRevAl bought by tobacco companies 2 create false narrative on Menthol Ban in Tobacco that disproportionately target black communities, need AG @TishJames to file a lawsuit against this #genocide,” Bichotte wrote.</p>
      <p>Mike Seilback, the American Lung Association’s national assistant vice president of state public policy, said his organization is “really disappointed that Speaker Johnson seems to be putting politics ahead of public health.”</p>
      <p>Sharpton has repeatedly denied that R.J. Reynolds’ money plays a role in NAN policymaking.</p>
      <p>He maintains that a menthol-cigarette ban could <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/01/30/al-sharpton-raises-concerns-about-ban-on-menthol-flavored-cigarettes/">create “another Eric Garner situation</a>,” referring to the Staten Island man who died in 2014 after being taken down by a cop amid a dispute over selling illegal smokes.</p>
      <p>Still, <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2019/09/21/five-years-after-eric-garner-s-death--legislation-proposed-to-ban-chokeholds-statewide">among the bill’s biggest backers is the NAACP</a>, which blames menthol tobacco for being a leading cause of African Americans getting hooked on smoking.</p>
      <p>Reached by phone, Sharpton insisted that he is “not endorsing smoking” of any kind or “calling shots” on the council over the bill.</p>
      <p>The anti-menthol bill, pitched by Councilman Fernando Cabrera (D-Bronx), has the support of 37 of the 51 council members, well over the majority needed for it to become law — if Johnson ever puts it to the floor.</p>
      <p>Johnson’s office did not directly address questions about whether Sharpton has played a role in the bill being shunted aside.</p>
      <p>Instead, it issued a statement saying the speaker is “committed” to finding a middle ground to “address the public-health crisis associated with menthol cigarettes” after hearing “concerns” that a ban “would create a black market in a community that has been over-policed in the past.”</p>
      <p>Cabrera said that getting his bill to the finish line would likely mean reworking its language to include a “criminal-justice element” protecting against over-enforcement — as Sharpton has suggested. </p>
      <p>The push to ban menthol-cigarette sales citywide comes amid an even larger groundswell of support to pull e-cigarettes — with flavors like cotton candy and bubble gum — off store shelves amid a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html">national crisis that  has seen 47 people die</a> from vaping-related illness in 2019.</p>
      <p>The council is preparing to pass legislation by Councilman Mark Levine (D-Manhattan) on Tuesday to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/08/anti-smoking-group-pumps-1m-into-city-council-battle-over-e-cigs/">ban flavored e-cigarette sales citywide.</a></p>
