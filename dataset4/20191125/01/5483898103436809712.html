        <b>According to Fairfax:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>“[A] suspected Chinese intelligence group offered a million dollars to pay for the political campaign of Liberal Party member and Melbourne luxury car dealer Bo “Nick” Zhao, 32, to run for an eastern suburbs seat. The plot appears to be part of an operation to place a Chinese agent in Parliament.<br/><br/>“Mr Zhao disclosed the alleged approach to ASIO about a year ago, according to his associates and multiple Western security sources, and he identified the man he says approached him as another Melbourne businessman, Brian Chen…<br/><br/>“In March this year, Mr Zhao was found dead in a Melbourne motel room. Local police who have prepared a brief for the coroner have been unable to conclude how he died.”</blockquote>
