      <h1>Falling demand for IRA merchandise threatens SF firm</h1>
      <h2>Republican Merchandising Ltd accumulated losses and laid off its three staff last year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:38:25+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/colm-keena-7.1010717" target="_blank">Colm Keena</a></address>
      <p>The Sinn Féin company involved in the sale of republican memorabilia and occasional publications laid off its staff last year, according to accounts just filed.</p>
      <p>The accounts show <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Republican+Merchandising">Republican Merchandising</a> Ltd had no staff by the end of 2018, having had three the previous year.</p>
      <p>At the end of 2018 the company had accumulated losses of €88,543, and was dependent on financial support from Sinn Féin for its continued survival.</p>
      <p>“Trading conditions during the year were difficult,” the directors said in their report accompanying the accounts. “There are no changes in business practices planned at present.”</p>
      <p>Rising costs and “changing consumer tastes” were a threat to the business, they said.</p>
      <p>The company operates a shop on Parnell Square, Dublin, and it sells online. It ceased the sale of T-shirts and other items celebrating the Provisional IRA last year.</p>
      <p>At the end of the year the company owed €85,879 to Sinn Féin. “Sinn Féin has indicated that it will not seek repayment of this amount until such time as the company is in a position to do so.”</p>
      <p>The company is based at 58 Parnell Square West, Dublin, one of two adjacent addresses own by the party. It recorded a loss for 2018 of €17,105. The loss the previous year was €11,005. Staffing costs fell to €11,341 in 2018, having been €114,297 the previous year.</p>
      <p>The website, <a href="http://www.sinnfeinbookshop.com/">sinnfeinbookshop.com</a>, sells books, clothing, badges and other items associated with the IRA, Sinn Féin and Irish unity.</p>
      <p>The site is currently promoting “<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Bobby+Sands">Bobby Sands</a>: Remember the Hunger Strikers” jerseys featuring the number 81 on the back. Mr Sands died in 1981.</p>
      <p>A limited edition Martin McGuinness print is available for €600, while Loughgall Martyrs and Easter lily badges are €4.99.</p>
      <p>Turnover for the company in 2018 was €142,732, down from the €168,076 in sales recorded the previous year.</p>
      <p>Administrative costs were down sharply, falling to €48,363 from €151,343 the previous year, largely explained by the laying-off of staff.</p>
      <h3>An Phoblacht online</h3>
      <p>The company’s directors are <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Brian+Dowling">Brian Dowling</a>, who replaced <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Pat+Finlay">Pat Finlay</a> in February last year, and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Treasa+Quinn">Treasa Quinn</a>, who is Sinn Féin’s “appropriate officer” for its financial filings to the Standards in Public Office Commission.</p>
      <p>Ms Quinn and Mr Dowling are also the directors of Parnell Publications CLG, the company that used to publish An Phoblacht, which is also based at 58 Parnell Square West.</p>
      <p>The company recorded turnover of €14,100 in 2018, down from €57,407 the previous year, in accounts filed recently.</p>
      <p>The print edition of the publication ceased in early 2018. The party now runs an online version as well as publishing an occasional magazine-format version with a €5 cover price.</p>
      <p>Mr Dowling and Ms Quinn are also directors of a company called Ireland Commemorations Company, set up to run a 1916 commemoration exhibition at the former Ambassador cinema at the top of O’Connell Street in Dublin.</p>
      <p>The company had accumulated losses of €122,823 at the end of 2018. It owed €19,899 to Sinn Féin, and €109,494 to Friends of Sinn Féin, the US-based fund-raising arm of the party. Under Irish law, funds raised abroad cannot be used to support party-political activity.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year it emerged that an English man, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=William+Hampton">William Hampton</a>, had left €1.6 million in his will to the “political party in the Republic of Ireland known at this time as Sinn Féin”.</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin has said the money is to go to the party in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>The party’s latest accounts in the Republic show income in 2017 of €3.7 million, the bulk of it from the State. The party’s 2018 accounts for Northern Ireland show income of £862,081, of which donations were £270,326.</p>
      <p>A request for a comment from the party met with no response.</p>
