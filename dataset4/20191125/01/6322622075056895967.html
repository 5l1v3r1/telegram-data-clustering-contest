      <h1>HLIB Research raises target price for Bumi Armada to 60 sen</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 25): Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) Research has maintained its “Buy” rating on Bumi Armada Bhd at 50.5 sen with a higher target price (TP) of 60 sen (from 44 sen) and said its third quarter of 2019 (3Q19) earnings was above expectations.</p>
      <p>In a note today, HLIB Research said Bumi Armada registered 3Q19 earnings of RM90.9 million (+41.6% quarter-on-quarter [q-o-q], +20.6% year-on-year [y-o-y]), lifting the cumulative nine months of 2019 (9M19) net profit to RM228.5 million (+27.7% y-o-y).</p>
      <p>“This came above expectations due to (i) improved contributions from its floating production and off-loading (FPO) segment and (ii) higher than-expected JV &amp; associates contribution, making up 91.5%/84.5%% of ours/consensus full-year forecasts,” the research house said.</p>
      <p>In addition, it said that as expected, no dividend was declared.</p>
      <p>HLIB said Bumi Armada’s core profit improved by +33% year-to-date (YTD) from RM178.9 million in 9M19 largely attributable to stronger FPO segment (+33.1%; better Kraken contribution) and joint ventures (JVs) (+10.4%).</p>
      <p>However, this was partially offset by weaker offshore marine services (OMS) segment due to completion of the Lukoil project despite stronger offshore support vessel (OSV) utilisation.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the research house said floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) Kraken is achieving material improvement in production efficiency this year and is expected to continue to produce stable earnings.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it also said 5 OSVs were sold, leaving its total fleet at 32 in 3Q19, adding that Bumi Armada will continue to monetise its non-core assets.</p>
      <p>“We understand that they are looking for a buyer of FPSO Claire as well. As evident by the better OSV utilisation of 58% in 3Q19 (vs. 51% in 2Q19), we can expect the OSV fleet utilisation to increase amidst fleet disposal and marginal improvement in daily charter rate (DCRs),” it said.</p>
      <p>Hence, HLIB Research increased its financial year 2019-2021 (FY19-21) earnings by 10%-12% after imputing higher earnings contribution from its JV FPSO assets.</p>
      <p>At 9:13am, shares of Bumi Armada dropped 2 sen to 48.5 sen, valuing it at RM2.97 billion.</p>
