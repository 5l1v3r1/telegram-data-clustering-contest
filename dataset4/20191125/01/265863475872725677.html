      <h1>Kristen Bell Reveals How She And Dax Shepard Went From No Sparks To Madly In Love</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:48:13+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:48</time> by <a rel="author">Rachelle Lewis</a></address>
      <p>Kristen Bell has revealed how she and <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/kristen-bell-talks-lessons-learned-from-dax-shepards-alcoholism-recovery-329426/">husband Dax Shepard</a> went form no sparks to madly in love. It was not love at first sight for the couple many people now refer to as relationship goals.</p>
      <p>In a candid interview with <i>Today</i>, Bell admitted there was no romantic connection between her and Shepard when they first met.</p>
      <p>“The producer of <i>Forgetting Sarah Marshall,</i> Shauna Robertson, who’s Judd Apatow’s previous producing partner, had a birthday dinner. Like, 10 people, maybe less, at a sushi restaurant. And I had just gotten out of a long-term relationship two months prior. And in retrospect, I realize Dax had just gotten out of a long relationship. We were sitting at a table. The only thing I remember is that he talked so much,” she shared.</p>

      <p>The <i>Frozen 2</i> star went on to dish about her baby daddy’s talkative side. Anyone who listens to his podcast, <i>Armchair Expert</i>, knows exactly what the blonde beauty is referencing, Shepard is a chatterbox. Bell admitted during their initial meeting she had no idea who Shepard was, even thinking he was one of the Jackass guys because of his demeanor.</p>
      <p>She was so unimpressed by her first encounter with her hubby, it shocked Bell when she saw him at a hockey game later and the flirting began. The actress admitted the second encounter was more fun, flirty and intriguing. However, what truly sealed the deal for Bell was a bold and risky text Shepard sent her.</p>
      <p>“‘Hi, my name is Dax. I violated your privacy and got your number from Shauna. How do you feel about that?” said the text message.</p>
      <p>The mother of two responded by telling Shepard “And I was like, Excuse me? You sound stimulating.”</p>

      <p>It was a risky move on Shepard’s part because it could have gone drastically wrong. However, Bell was anything but upset. She got butterflies kicking off the beginning of their romance. <i>The Good Place</i> star also admitted that she fell in love with her husband way before he did with her.</p>
      <p>Kristen Bell felt no connection with Dax Shepard when they first met. Thanks to a bold text from him, they went from no sparks to madly in love. They have been together for 13 years, married for six years and have two beautiful daughters.</p>
      <p>The lesson here is just because it wasn’t love, at first sight, does not mean romance won’t blossom. Oh, and give people a chance.</p>
