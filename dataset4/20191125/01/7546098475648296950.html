      <h1>Why the Nufarm share price has plummeted 18% today</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:43:32+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/kennethhallau/" target="_blank">Kenneth Hall</a></address>
      <p>The <b>Nufarm Limited </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Nufarm+Limited/?ticker=ASX-NUF">(ASX: NUF)</a> share price has been hammered on the ASX this morning. At the time of writing, Nufarm shares are down more than 17% today at just $5.06 per share.</p>
      <p>So, why are the company’s shares under pressure and leading the ASX 200 losers today?</p>
      <h3>Why the Nufarm share price has taken a hit today</h3>
      <p>The Nufarm share price is under pressure after <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/25/nufarm-shares-under-pressure-after-half-year-earnings-downgrade/">releasing a half-year earnings announcement</a> this morning.</p>
      <p>Nufarm cited difficult trading conditions for FY20 and lowered its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) forecast.</p>
      <p>High channel inventories and “substantially lower” demand in North America were big factors behind weak earnings.</p>
      <p>Nufarm expects its first half 2020 EBITDA to be “significantly lower” compared to last year. This includes first quarter EBITDA figures down $20 million on 1H 2020 numbers.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/03/20/results-nufarm-share-price-crashes-13-lower-on-dividend-suspension-and-guidance-downgrade/">Nufarm share price crashed 13% lower in March 2019</a> after the company’s half-year 2019 result. Underlying EBITDA was down 1.9% to $120.9 million in March despite 8% revenue growth during the half.</p>
      <p>Nufarm is expecting the majority of its first-half earnings to come from the second quarter. It also said first half EBITDA is expected to be “significantly lower” compared to its 1H 2019 numbers, without providing specific guidance.</p>
      <h3>How has Nufarm performed in 2019?</h3>
      <p>It’s been a tough year for Nufarm shareholders and this morning’s declines have tipped the Nufarm share price into the red.</p>
      <p>Nufarm is trading at $5.06 per share, having started the year 13.53% higher at $5.84 per share.</p>
      <p>The company still boasts a market cap of $1.9 billion but trades at a whopping 68.54x price-to-earnings multiple.</p>
      <p>This year, the Aussie agribusiness company has faced domestic drought conditions and negative sentiment from the ongoing <b>Monsanto</b> lawsuits overseas.</p>
      <p>But it hasn’t all been bad news. The <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/10/01/why-the-nufarm-share-price-is-up-12-today-and-42-this-week/">Nufarm share price rocketed 45.74% higher in the space of 2 days</a> back in late September after announcing the sale of its South American crop protection and seed treatment operations.</p>
      <p>Nufarm today said that the sale process is continuing, which is subject to shareholder approval on 5 December and relevant regulatory approvals.</p>
