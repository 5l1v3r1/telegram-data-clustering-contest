      <h1>Snow forecast for Canberra just days out from start of summer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew Brown</a></address>
      <p>The start of summer may be just days away, but snow has been forecast to return to parts of the ACT on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Bureau of Meteorology has forecast falls of up to several centimetres in areas above 1500 metres near Mount Ginini on Tuesday evening.</p>

      <p>The forecast comes as Canberra is set to receive a dust storm and potential smoke haze that could be as <a href="https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6506695/thick-cloud-of-dust-over-canberra-should-clear-this-weekend/">bad as conditions seen on the weekend.</a></p>
      <p>Meteorologist Helen Kirkup said the conditions were driven by a cold front sweeping across large parts of NSW.</p>
      <p>"It will be coming through Canberra late on Tuesday," Ms Kirkup said.</p>
      <p>"There's a fair bit of cold air behind the front, and we're looking at the chance of a thunderstorm in large areas of NSW including the ACT."</p>
      <p>The bureau says snow is also forecast for Thredbo and Perisher, along with surrounding areas in the Snowy Mountains.</p>
      <p>Ms Kirkup said while the conditions bringing snow were rare for this time of year, it wasn't out of the ordinary.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't happen often but you do sometimes see snow in November," she said.</p>
      <p>"In terms of amounts, it won't be much, but we might see a few centimetres at most."</p>

      <p>The strong winds driving the cold front could also bring a dust storm to Canberra.</p>
      <p>Thick clouds of dust were seen over the capital on Friday, driven by swirling winds.</p>
      <p>Ms Kirkup said it was still too early to tell how severe the dust storm could be on Tuesday, but conditions could be similar to last week.</p>
      <p>"How much dust gets over the Great Dividing Range is always the question, but the ingredients for the dust storm are definitely there," she said.</p>
      <p>"There are very strong winds ahead of the front and there's a good chance they'll be strong enough to pick up dust out in western NSW and even South Australia."</p>
      <p>The dust storm is expected to hit during the afternoon and into the evening on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Smoke haze has also been forecast for the area for Tuesday as a result of several large bushfires still burning across NSW.</p>
      <p>The bureau says there is an 80 per cent chance of rain, with up to 15 millimetres predicted.</p>
      <p>Winds of up to 45km/h are expected in the morning before easing.</p>
      <p>Tuesday is expected to reach a top of 28 degrees, with sunny days to return on Wednesday with a high of 27, before reaching into the 30s on Thursday.</p>
