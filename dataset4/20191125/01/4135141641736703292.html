      <h1>Tyler Breeze becomes new UpUpDownDown Champion during Grubhub live stream</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:52:22+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:52</time> by <a rel="author">WWE.com</a></address>
      <p>Survivor Series Sunday featured two title changes before the show even started — all on an UpUpDownDown live stream, presented by Grubhub! </p>
      <p>First, Cesaro retained his title after Team Cesaro, featuring the Swiss Cyborg’s drafted squad of Alexa Bliss, Gentleman Jack Gallagher and Rusev, defeated Team Kingston across a number of games. Kofi Kingston’s chosen squad consisted of Big E, The Miz and King Corbin.</p>
      <p>Cesaro later put the title on the line again, however, and The Goddess of WWE unseated him through a win in “Brawlhalla” to become UpUpDownDown Champion.</p>
      <p>But Little Miss Bliss’ title reign was short-lived. Initially disguised as a Grubhub delivery man, Tyler Breeze revealed himself and swooped in for an immediate shot at Bliss’ title in “Saturday Night Slam Masters,” emerging victorious as the new UpUpDownDown Champion. </p>
      <p>You can rewatch all the action by viewing the live stream replay below. </p>
