      <p>THE parents of a three-year-old boy who urgently requires a life-saving heart transplant have appealed to the most powerful figure in the health service to overhaul the north's system on organ donation.</p>
      <p>Dáithí Mac Gabhann from west Belfast was given just a 10 per cent chance of survival after surgery at four-days-old due to a rare form of congenital heart disease.</p>
      <p>Defying the odds and astounding medics, the bi-lingual dinosaur-mad boy has just started an Irish-medium 'Naíonra' (playschool) where he is "thriving and loving making new friends", according to his mother, Seph Ní Mhealláin.</p>
      <p>However, he is one of three children in Northern Ireland who needs a new heart as all other treatment options have been exhausted.</p>

      <p>For the past 18 months, his family <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/2018/09/10/news/brave-da-ithi-wins-over-an-army-of-fans-during-organ-donation-week-1428579/">has led a high-profile campaign</a> to raise awareness around organ donation culminating in a letter sent last Friday to Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health.</p>
      <p>Dáithí's 'signature' is on the letter alongside his parents.</p>

      <p>The correspondence follows backing from the main political parties to introduce a new 'soft opt out' system, whereby all adults will be considered an organ donor after their death unless they recorded a decision stating otherwise.</p>
      <p>England and Scotland are due to introduce the new law next spring, while the opt-out system has been operating in Wales since December 2015 - where family consent rates have increased. Draft legislation is also making its way through the Republic.</p>

      <p>The Northern Ireland Assembly decided in 2016 to keep 'opt-in' laws, meaning signing up to the NHS Organ Donation Register to give consent.</p>
      <p>For Ms Ní Mhealláin, a change to the system will benefit her son and could transform outcomes for hundreds of patients awaiting transplants.</p>
      <p>"We're not politicians but as a mother I would appeal to Mr Pengelly to review the existing laws - it's my may of doing my best for my son. The legislation on abortion and same sex marriage has been changed, can there not be another option for organ donation?"</p>

      <p>She and Dáithí's father, Máirtín, said they had had been "overwhelmed" by <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/2018/09/13/news/schoolkids-become-organ-donors-after-being-bowled-over-by-high-fiving-toddler-who-needs-new-heart-1431686/">the public response to their campaign</a> and credited their little boy as its "backbone".</p>
      <p>"He has made us so proud and has turned my pain into power," Ms Ní Mhealláin said.</p>
      <p>"We went through a rough patch during his early days and always tried to picture us taking him to school. That happened two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>"At the moment Dáithí is stable and underwent his transplant assessment recently. But now the cold weather is in you can see the difference between him and other kids and how a small cold can really hit him - we are just waiting for the call to come in."</p>
      <p>A department spokeswoman said a "detailed examination" of "all aspects of soft opt-out systems" was carried out three years ago but wasn't backed by the assembly.</p>
      <p>"Therefore any changes to the existing arrangements would need to be reconsidered by a health minister and the NI assembly."</p>
