      <p>The video then cuts to one of the pair attempting to turn the motor on. Water comes out of the exhaust pipe.</p>
      <p>"What do you mean? It still goes fine," he says.</p>
      <p>After 9 News posted the story to its Facebook page, criticism flowed in.</p>
      <p>"I would love to see you do that in your own pool, own motorbike, and your own country," one said. "That was disrespectful to the locals. People like you should NEVER leave Australia."</p>
      <p>Another said: "Of course he wasn't disrespecting the locals he was disrespecting all Australians all of us [sic]."</p>
      <p>But Raymond told 9 News he doesn't care if people think he's immature.</p>
      <p>"I just don't want people thinking it's a rental scooter... [that] I'm disrespecting the locals," he told 9 News.</p>
      <p>He said he spends four months in Indonesia every year, and he was under the influence of alcohol.</p>
