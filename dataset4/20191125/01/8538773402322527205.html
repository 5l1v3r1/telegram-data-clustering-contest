      <h1>Trent Boult likely to miss second Test due to pain in ribs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:20:40+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:20</time> by <a rel="author">ESPNcricinfo staff</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/newzealand/content/player/277912.html">Trent Boult</a> is likely to miss the second Test of New Zealand's series against England after leaving the field due to a pain in the right-hand side of his ribs on the fifth day of the first Test.</p>
      <p>Boult, who bowled one over on the final day before going off, will undergo an MRI scan tomorrow to determine the extent of the injury.</p>
      <p>The second Test at Hamilton starts on Friday, and with New Zealand starting a three-match series in Australia soon after that fixture, it seems unlikely he will be risked. <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/newzealand/content/player/493773.html">Lockie Ferguson</a> and <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/newzealand/content/player/506612.html">Matt Henry</a> are the other seam-bowling options in the 15-man squad.</p>
      <p>Boult has missed only three Tests since 2016, and just six of New Zealand's 70 since his debut.</p>
