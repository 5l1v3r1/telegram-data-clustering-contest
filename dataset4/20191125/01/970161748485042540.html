      <p>Camila Cabello gave fans a little taste of what they can expect from her <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/american-music-awards/">American Music Awards</a> performance, as she dropped her new music video just hours before.</p>
      <p>Taking to Instagram, Camila revealed that the video to her new track Living Proof is out right now and the steamy vid sees her channelling her inner fairy nymph while getting hot and heavy with a shirtless man.</p>
      <p>Oo-er.</p>

      <p>Urging her fans to go and give her new release a watch, Camila wrote: ‘the video for living proof is OUT NOW. I loved pretending I was a little fairy nymph cuz that’s all I wanna be !!!! watch the #LivingProofVideo on @YouTubeMusic and tell me what u think.’</p>
      <p>Camila’s post came just hours before she is set to perform Living Proof at the American Music Awards on Sunday night.</p>

      <p>Camila is also up for an award, alongside boyfriend Shawn Mendes. The pair have been nominated for the Collaboration of the Year award for their song Senorita.</p>
      <p>Although, they’ll be facing tough competition from the likes of Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus for their hit Old Town Road, as well as Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga’s Shallow.</p>
      <p>Sadly there was no loved-up red carpet appearance from Camila and boyfriend Shawn, as he actually arrived solo to the AMAs – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/camila-cabello-and-shawn-mendes-cant-keep-their-hands-or-their-lips-to-themselves-on-courtside-date-11083242/">despite all their PDAs of late.</a></p>
      <p>He and Camila are yet to actually confirm they are a couple, but there’s no doubt the pair are pretty smitten about each other.</p>
      <p>So much so, that Camila recently revealed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/camila-cabello-feelings-shawn-mendes-since-2015-smiles-heading-vocal-coach-11186182/">she’s had feelings for Shawn since 2015</a> – ever since she collaborated with the singer on his song I Know What You Did Last Summer.</p>
      <p>‘During I Know What You Did Last Summer I really bonded with him as more than a friend,’ the 22-year-old said. ‘I think he did, too, but we were both really young, and he was experiencing the pressures of his career.’</p>
      <p>She added to Rolling Stone: ‘I don’t think we knew what to do with those feelings. It was this awkward thing where we both liked each other, but we weren’t together. It was just weird.</p>

      <p>‘Our paths just didn’t cross in that way romantically until we started hanging out again and writing. For me, it just brought it back.’</p>
