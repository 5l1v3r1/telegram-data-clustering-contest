      <p>I REALLY love my fiance and we plan to get married in May 2020. We're well advanced with our plans and it should be an exciting and joyful time for us both, but my fiance's mother is making my life miserable.</p>
      <p>I do not, and for as long as I can remember have never wanted to have children. However my mother-in-law-to-be cannot understand this. I've tried to explain that it's not something I want to do, and that I think it's irresponsible to bring children into the world right now as it's in such a mess. I know not everyone agrees with me, but I do feel strongly about it and fortunately I've met a man who agrees with me, even if his mum doesn't.</p>
      <p>She's so angry with me and has even accused me of being selfish, when I think it's the opposite. She doesn't seem to understand the state the world is in. On top of that, my career and my future husband are important to me and I am not prepared to risk either by having children.</p>
      <p>My fiance is perfectly happy with my decision and says it's my body so my choice. As he's supportive, what business is it of hers to think she can tell us how we should live?</p>
      <p>
        <b>NR</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>FIONA SAYS:</b> It's not her business at all – it's a decision only you and your fiance can make. However, I think you may be missing the point of her behaviour. I suspect she probably desperately wants grandchildren and is devastated to think her son and you, his wife, will never give her any.</p>
      <p>I don't know whether she has any other children who can fulfil that need for her but, for some women, the need to reproduce and perpetuate the line is an enormously strong biological urge. She chose to do this, and by refusing to have children, you have rejected her lifestyle choice. That, I suspect, may feel hurtful to her – but that still doesn't make it right for her to be trying to force you to do something that feels wrong to you.</p>
      <p>Concentrate on showing her how much you love her son and how happy he is with you, and I'm sure she'll soon come around. She may never like your decision, but she will, in time, have to accept it. I'm sure she will continue to hope that you'll change your mind and may regularly drop hints, but try not to take it personally.</p>
      <p>One word of caution though; you say your fiance feels as you do but please be certain of this. He may not be making a fuss but that's not the same as actively agreeing with you. It's really important that he does and isn't going along with what you say just because he loves you so much. If he has any doubts, hopes to persuade you later, or feels that he might one day want a family after all, you could be heading for trouble – especially if his mother continues to pressure him. Do please have a heart to heart with him to be sure he feels as you do.</p>
      <p>You need to be looking forward to your wedding next year, so maybe it's time to sit down and have a heart-to-heart with your mother-in-law-to-be too. Be gentle with her and explain that you're not rejecting her choices but that the world has changed so much since she made them.</p>
      <p>You are absolutely right that having children is an enormous responsibility. It is surely better and less selfish to make a positive choice to have children (or not, as in your case) than simply having babies because it is expected of you. I am sure that, if more people stopped and considered the real impact of parenthood and their feelings towards it, they would have far fewer problems.</p>

        <b>WILL THINGS EVER BE THE SAME AGAIN AFTER MY HUSBAND'S AFFAIR?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I AM 34 and always thought that, for the last nine years, I was in a stable and loving relationship. Then I found out my husband had been having an affair. We had a furious row and he walked out. He was gone for about three weeks, then out of the blue, turned up on the doorstep saying that he'd made dreadful mistake. He begged me to forgive him and, although I was still angry and hurt, I agreed.</p>
      <p>We have now been back together for just over three weeks and, although I agreed to forgive him, I am finding it very hard to live up to this. I can't stop thinking about what he did and worrying whether he will do it again. Can things ever go back to the way they were?</p>
      <p>
        <b>GL</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>FIONA SAYS:</b> Once someone has been hurt like this, it can take a long time for trust to be re-established and your husband needs to understand this. He also needs to understand what he needs to do if this marriage is to survive, and part of this is getting to grips with what caused the problem in the first place.</p>
      <p>I'm not, for a moment, suggesting that you are to blame for his affair, but I cannot help but wonder if things between you had become a little stale – had you lost some of the magic? Counselling through Relate (relate.org.uk) might help you to understand why things went wrong. You could also consider reading a Relate book – After The Affair: How To Build Trust And Love Again, by Julia Cole.</p>
      <p>The next few months are not going to be easy for either of you or your husband. He needs to understand that while you may be willing to say you'll forgive him, actually doing so is much more difficult.</p>

        <b>HE'S DIVORCED BUT HIS EX-WIFE STILL DOES HIS HOUSEWORK</b>
      </p>
      <p>THE man I've been going out with got his divorce some six months ago. I was widowed three years ago, and this is the first serious relationship I've had since. Our relationship has grown slowly out of a friendship that grew out of our shared interest in dancing.</p>
      <p>It took a while before I was ready but, a week ago, I spent the night at his house. The following morning I was accosted by his next-door neighbour, who started shouting at me and saying I should be ashamed of myself.</p>
      <p>Naturally, I was dreadfully upset and demanded to know what this meant. It seems that although they're divorced, his ex-wife still visits him most days to cook and wash his clothes for him. I told him I just couldn't comprehend this and left, but now I don't know what to do and whether I should see him again.</p>
      <p>
        <b>VE</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>FIONA SAYS:</b> He may be legally divorced, but it seems to me that his relationship with his ex-wife is far from over. I'm not saying that they still necessarily have a physical relationship – rather that he has simply let his ex-wife continue to care for him.</p>
      <p>Where you go from here will depend on how strong your feelings are for him, and whether you are prepared to force the issue of his ex-wife still acting as though she were still married. It could be that she thinks him incapable of coping by himself – and perhaps he is.</p>
      <p>If you want your relationship to continue, he is going to have to end this cosy set-up – but are you prepared to take up the role of housekeeper which, it seems, he seems to need?</p>

        <b>SO HURT BY MY BOYFRIEND'S CHEATING</b>
      </p>
      <p>I FOUND out my boyfriend had been two-timing me, so I split up with him. I know he doesn't deserve my love, but I find I cannot forget about him. It really hurts when I see him out and about with his other girlfriend and I'm tempted to tell her that he cheated on her with me, so she should look out in case he does it to her again. I feel depressed all the time and I'm so embarrassed to tell people what's happened that I'm not talking to my mates about it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WA</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>FIONA SAYS:</b> You won't gain anything by being vindictive towards his new girlfriend – after all, it's not her fault that your ex is such a louse. I suspect she'll find out soon enough anyway. Rather than keep your friends at bay, open-up to them. You have no need to be embarrassed as you've done nothing wrong, so don't be too embarrassed to let them help you get over this. I know you still feel very raw but if you let your friends support you, give yourself time and pamper yourself whenever possible, the hurt and pain will pass. In the meantime, try to get out and do more – don't give him the satisfaction of seeing how much he has hurt you.</p>
