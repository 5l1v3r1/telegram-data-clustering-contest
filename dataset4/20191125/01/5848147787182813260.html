      <h1>Football round up: Babbel lets loose in wake of Western Sydney loss</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:14:41+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/joey-lynch/" target="_blank">Joey Lynch</a></address>
      <p>The story of the A-League round came in Sydney’s west, as a controversial penalty swung the momentum as top-of-the-table Melbourne City downed Western Sydney Wanderers 3-2 at Bankwest Stadium.</p>
      <p>Taking the lead after Bruce Kamau set up Kwame Yeboah in just the second minute, the Wanderers had initially looked like they were sitting pretty against a blunt City.</p>
      <p>Yet, a disputed decision to award City a penalty in the 56th minute by referee Chris Beath after an apparent foul on City prodigy Denis Genreau allowed Jamie Maclaren to level things up.</p>
      <p>Just under 20 minutes later, Maclaren turned provider with a cross that Josh Brilliante – still tormenting the Wanderers despite switching from Sydney FC – steered home from close-range.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, the Wanderers answered back in the 80th when Yeboah fired in from close range.</p>
      <p>But in the 92nd minute Lachlan Wales – the subject of much controversy after his Olyroos suspension midweek – picked out Maclaren inside the penalty area to fire home for his 19th goal in 12 games for club and country in 2019/20.</p>
      <p>Speaking to media post-game, Wanderers Head Coach Markus Babbel was unable to contain his fury when asked about the contentious penalty’s veracity, proclaiming; “is that a serious question? Serious question? F––––sake. No Comment.</p>
      <p>Babbel will likely face a fine for his post-game antics but, judging from the reaction of the Wanderers faithful, he probably won himself an even greater admiration from the red and black faithful in return.</p>
      <h3>Roar fail to fire</h3>
      <p>Babbel’s former Liverpool teammate Robbie Fowler’s poor start to life as coach of Brisbane Roar continued in the first of Saturday’s three games.</p>
      <p>Wellington Phoenix captain Steven Taylor put his club ahead after just ten minutes and Ulises Dávila made it two in the 49th.</p>
      <p>Though Stefan Mauk got a late goal back, the result marked a depressing return to dour reality for the Roar after their breakthrough 4-3 win over City last week.</p>
      <p>Melbourne Victory’s woes continued against Adelaide United</p>
      <p>Riley McGree – playing in his first game since also receiving a ban from national team duty – made it 1-0 in the 23rd minute only for Ola Toivonen to even it up  in the 61st minute.</p>

      <p>The Reds restored their lead just moments later through an own goal from Migjen Basha. The in-form McGree nailed a brace five minutes later to seal a comfortable win and send Victory second-bottom of the league.</p>
      <p>There was also no Grand Final revenge for Perth Glory in Saturday’s final contest, as Tony Popovic’s side went down to defending champions Sydney FC in the west.</p>
      <p>A 12th minute penalty from Adam le Fondre quickly had the Harboursiders ahead at HBF Park but Bruno Fornaroli sealed his place as the quickest player in A-League history to 50 goals with an equaliser in the 44th minute.</p>
      <p>Alas for Glory, played onside by millimetres, Kosta Barbarouses restored the visitors lead in the 58th minute and Milos Ninkovic made it 3-1 in the 65th.</p>
      <p>Popovic said after the game his backline needed “time” before they were to fire on all cylinders.</p>
      <p>The round’s final contest in Gosford saw a little piece of history made as Central Coast Mariners consigned Western United to back-to-back defeats for the first time in their existence.</p>
      <h3>The W-League</h3>
      <p>Defending premiers Melbourne Victory recorded their first win of the season after a spectacularly well-taken goal from Natasha Dowie propelled them to a 3-2 win over Brisbane Roar.</p>
      <p>They now travel to South Korea as Australia’s first-ever representatives in the AFC Women’s Club Championship.</p>
      <p>On Friday evening, Western Sydney Wanderers recorded a deserved, lightning delayed, 1-0 win over Newcastle Jets after a second-half Amy Harrison penalty.</p>
      <p>In South Australia, defending champions Sydney FC made it two wins from two and went top of ‘the Dub’ after a tight contest against Adelaide United.</p>
      <p>Matildas’ attacker Caitlin Foord turned in a Chloe Logarzo cross in the 57th minute for the game’s only goal.</p>
      <p>Leaving it incredibly late, Melbourne City was able to join their crosstown rivals in recording their first win of the season after coming back from a Katie Stengel-supplied deficit to defeat Canberra United 2-1 in the nation’s capital.</p>
      <p>A 66th minute goal from Serb international Milicia Mijatović and a penalty from Matildas’ stalwart Emily van Egmond in the 94th minute did the damage.</p>
      <h3>The Best of the Rest</h3>
      <p>The eyes of the footballing world rested squarely upon one man over the weekend – and he probably wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
      <p>José Mourinho took up a position in the Tottenham Hotspur dugout for the first time on Saturday night and watched on as his new side recorded a 3-2 win over London-rivals West Ham.</p>
      <p>The scoreline, though, flattered a shambolic Hammers side.</p>
      <p>Unfairly maligned after his stint at a Manchester United, Mourinho’s appointment – made mid-week after Spurs sacked Mauricio Pochettino less than 12 months after he took them to the Champions League final – was a move that launched a thousand think-pieces.</p>
      <p>However, regardless of the detractors, the 56-year-old remains one of the most successful managers in world football.</p>
