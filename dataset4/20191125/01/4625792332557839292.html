      <h1>‘I’m a student of the Holocaust’: Biden says Trump is stoking ‘same anti-Semitic bile’ as Nazis</h1>

      <p>2020 Democratic front-runner Joe Biden claimed President Trump is creating similar conditions in the United States to those that existed in Nazi Germany leading up to the Holocaust.</p>
      <p>"This is a guy who made a straight appeal for white supremacy. You saw those folks coming out of the fields out there in Charlottesville and everything since then, their veins bulging, the hate-spewing from them," the former vice president said Sunday evening at a fundraiser in Providence, Rhode Island, according to a pool report by Donita Naylor of the <i>Providence Journal</i>.</p>
      <p>"I'm a student of the Holocaust. Same anti-Semitic bile that was chanted in the streets in Germany in the 1930s," he continued. "Same thing. Carrying Nazi flags and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan."</p>
      <p>Biden has long claimed that a principle reason he decided to run for the White House a third time was because of the white supremacist protest dubbed the "United the Right" in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 that left one counter-protester dead and scores of others injured.</p>
      <p>Weeks after the incident, Biden wrote an op-ed for <i>The Atlantic</i> condemning Trump's response. The title of that piece, "We Are Living Through a Battle for the Soul of This Nation," has become a standard refrain in his campaign stump speeches.</p>
      <p>"You, me, and the citizens of this country carry a special burden in 2017. We have to do what our president has not. We have to uphold America’s value," <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/joe-biden-after-charlottesville/538128/">he wrote</a>. "We have to do what he will not. We have to defend our Constitution. We have to remember our kids are watching. We have to show the world America is still a beacon of light."</p>
      <p>Biden initially planned <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/joe-biden-not-announcing-2020-run-in-charlottesville">to announce</a> his presidential campaign in the college town but abruptly canceled and instead opted for an online video.</p>
