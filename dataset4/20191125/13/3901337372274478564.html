      <p>He might have been on the losing side on the day, but that did not stop the Instagram love from pouring in for Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Bruce Bvuma.</p>
      <p>The score line could have been much different had it not been for the heroics of the 24-year-old who was deputising for experienced campaigners, Itumeleng Khune and Daniel Akpeyi.</p>

      <p>Bvuma marshalled his defence and rose to the occasion whenever called upon in front of a packed Mbombela stadium. The youngster did not seem overawed by the magnitude of the occasion.</p>
      <p>Although Amakhosi suffered defeat on the day, there were rave reviews on Instagram for the man they have billed as “the future of South African goalkeeping”</p>
      <p>Compatriots like Bidvest Wits defender Zitha Macheke amongst others, took to Instagram to shower Bvuma with praise.</p>

        <b>Do you think that Bvuma can take over the reins at Kaizer Chiefs in years to come?</b>
