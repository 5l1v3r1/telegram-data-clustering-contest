      <p>Earlier today Huawei finally unveiled the much awaited <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/25/huawei-matepad-pro-official/#5">Huawei MatePad Pro</a>, the high-end tablet that’s expected to bring some tough competition to Apple’s iPad Pro.</p>
      <h3>Huawei MatePad Pro 5G Edition Coming in Q1 2020</h3>

      <p>Now, while the device packs some of the best hardware on the market, Huawei opted not to equip it with a “next gen” 5G module. Thus the smartphone won’t be able to use the faster cellular network standard; but that won’t be for long.</p>
      <p>Huawei did indeed later reveal another version of the MatePad Pro is coming in the future. More specifically, in the first quarter of 2020.</p>

      <p>The upcoming tablet will, of course, feature Huawei’s Kirin 990 5G chipset which as some of you may know supports 5G connectivity. The SoC also adopts an advanced 7nm manufacturing process to keep energy consumption down, while integrating a 5G modem. The Kirin 990 5G was also awarded as the best 5G chip a couple days back at the China Mobile Partner Conference.</p>
      <p>So, the Huawei MatePad Pro 5G could very well be the first tablet ever to feature 5G support; yet another spec it is first at. What are the others? Well, as we discovered earlier, the MatePad Pro is also the first tablet to sport a camera punch-hole design; the first tablet to feature wireless charging and reverse wireless charging; and boasts the higher screen-to-body ratio of any tablet at 90%.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the tablet is also Huawei’s first device to achieve a DCI-P3 color gamut display; first tablet to pack Huawei’s multi-screen collaboration feature and Huawei’s first tablet with a wireless charging stylus.</p>
      <p>Other specs on the MatePad Pro include a 10.8-inch display, a 7250mAh, up to 8GB of RAM and a maximum of 256GB of internal storage. Learn more about it in <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/25/huawei-matepad-pro-official/#5">this article</a>.</p>
