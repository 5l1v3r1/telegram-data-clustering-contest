      <h1>USD/CAD Technical Analysis: Bulls await a move beyond multi-month descending trend-line resistance</h1>

      <p>The USD/CAD pair gained some follow-through traction on Monday and built on the previous session's late rebound from the vicinity of mid-1.3200s.</p>
      <p>The uptick lifted the pair back above the 1.3300 handle, closer to multi-week tops and a <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> marked by 5-1/2-month-old descending trend-line.</p>
      <p>Given that the pair on Friday showed some resilience below the very important 200-day SMA, the set-up seems tilted firmly in favour of bullish trades.</p>
      <p>Moreover, technical <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> on the daily <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart">chart</a> maintained their bullish bias, which further reinforces the near-term constructive outlook for the major.</p>
      <p>Hence, a sustained move beyond the mentioned trend-line resistance will set the stage for a move towards October swing highs near mid-1.3300s.</p>
      <p>On the flip side, any meaningful pullback might continue to attract some dip-buying near 200-DMA, which if broken decisively might negate the positive outlook.</p>
      <p>Sustained weakness below the mentioned support now seems to accelerate the slide towards the 1.3200 handle before the pair eventually drops to the 1.3160-50 region.</p>
