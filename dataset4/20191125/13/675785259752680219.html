      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:15:23+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author">Elaine McCahill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/elaine-mccahill/</a></address>
      <p>A Tory MP has sparked outrage after saying he "personally can't do anything' about child poverty in his area.</p>
      <p>Gordon Henderson appeared on Victoria Derbyshire today as he campaigns to be re-elected as MP for the Sittingbourne and Sheppey constituency in Kent.</p>
      <p>Henderson, who has represented the area since 2010, was confronted with the figure that almost half of children on the Isle of Sheppey are living in poverty.</p>
      <p>He replied: "This hasn't just happened over the last nine years, there are deep-rooted reasons why we have deprivation in certain areas of this constituency, including in Sheerness, and it goes back 50 years.</p>
      <p>"It's been under <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> administrations and Conservative administrations, they are deep-rooted. A lot of it goes back to when they closed the dock yard here on Sheppey many years ago."</p>
      <p>Victoria interjected saying: "That was in the 50s!"</p>

      <p>Henderson continues: "It was in the 50s and it has never improved. I can't personally do anything about it Victoria."</p>
      <p>She hits back: "Why not?"</p>
      <p>"On a personal basis there is little I can do, but what I can do and what I am doing is...," he continued.</p>
      <p>Victoria then interjected to say: "You're the Conservative MP for nine years, your party has been in government for nine years."</p>
      <p>Henderson continues with his point saying he personally can't do anything as a constituent shouts over: "Then why should we vote for you?"</p>

      <p>He goes on: "What I'm doing is working with other people. For instance, I am currently working with Swale Borough Council to try and identify...</p>
      <p>"I actually undertook an exercise earlier this year to try and identify the people in my area, not just statistics.</p>
      <p>"We identified them, we contacted them and we tried to help resolve the problems but I can only do a little bit so I'm working with the council to try and identify who they are so we can help them."</p>
      <p>Viewers were outraged by his comments with one saying: "Why would anyone vote for that? He can't do anything, his party who have been in power for a decade can't do anything and have promised more of the same. So why not vote someone who can? Vote for change."</p>

      <p>Another said: "The Tories always have their excuses. Always the blame game. It's their fault."</p>
      <p>A third added: "My god with these politicians itâ€™s no wonder the isle of Sheppey is in such a mess."</p>
      <p>A fourth agreed saying: "Tories have been in here both national and local for decades. They've consistently and persistently failed Sittingbourne and Sheppey."</p>
