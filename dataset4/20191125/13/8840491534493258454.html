      <p>Cosmetic Creations Ltd, Ireland’s leading cosmetic formulator and contract manufacturer, has today announced that 90 jobs are to be created between its operations in Mayo and Cork, following an investment of €7.5million into the company.</p>
      <p>The announcement comes as the company officially opened their Cork site.</p>
      <p>Thirty are earmarked for the company’s Mayo head office, increasing numbers to 80. Sixty will be across operations, supply chain, quality and formulation development in Cork, bringing the workforce there to 100.</p>
      <p>Reinforcing today’s announcement is a newly agreed joint venture with Parnell Pharmaceuticals Limited, a California biopharmaceuticals company, with the company’s European headquarters relocating from Dublin to the Cosmetic Creations campus in Cork.</p>
      <p>Cosmetic Creations will manufacture over four million units in 2019, consisting of more than 100 individual products, most formulated in house, including skincare, personal care, self-tanning, supplements and base pharmaceutical line products.</p>
      <p>It is expected to grow this number to over 15 million units by 2022. Shipping to more than 15 countries globally, clients include private label national brand names and Irish, the UK and European retail multiples.</p>
      <p>Speaking on today’s announcement, Aiden Corcoran, wwner and CEO of Cosmetic Creations, said: “Cosmetic Creations is here to add value to how people feel, look and live, and since we acquired Cosmetic Creations in 2017, we have been hard at work, scaling the company to a high-volume large-scale operation.</p>
      <p>“Following the significant investment into our Claremorris facility, the acquisition and expansion of the former Yves Rocher site in Cork is the largest and most significant step in that strategic growth plan.</p>
      <p>“We are also delighted to have been able to rehire over 30 of the former Yves Rocher employees at our Cork site.</p>
      <p>“Over the last twelve months, we have invested in advanced formulation and manufacturing technologies in both Mayo and Cork, significantly expanding output capacity.</p>
      <p>“Our target is to deliver over 7 million units next year to Ireland, the UK and Europe, and we look forward to partnering with leading brands that wish to bring quality Irish-made products to the market.</p>
      <p>“Our goal over the next five years will be to build on our current foundation in cosmetics and expand into the growing national pharmaceutical market to become a global life sciences brand. Beginning in 2020, our new joint venture with Parnell Pharmaceuticals to develop, manufacture, market and distribute its wide range of products in the EU and Ireland is expected to increase our production of health-related products by over 150%.”</p>
      <p>The Minister for Rural &amp; Community Development, Michael Ring, said: “Cosmetic Creations has been a vital Mayo employer for 30 years, and I am delighted that they are continuing to expand and evolve. Their success is a testament to the opportunities for growth in Mayo and the surrounding region.”</p>
      <p>Officially opening the Cork site, An Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney, said: “It’s fantastic to see an indigenous company expanding nationally. Manufacturing is hugely important to both the Cork and national economy, and I look forward to Cosmetics Creations’ continued success.”</p>
      <p>Funding was raised through IPS Finance, who are based in Limerick. With over 30 years’ experience in contract formulation and manufacturing, the company also develop food supplements and animal welfare products.</p>
