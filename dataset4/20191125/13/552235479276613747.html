      <h1>Man arrested in Aberdeen after £37k worth of drugs destined for Shetland seized by cops</h1>
      <h2>The 22-year-old man is expected to appear at Aberdeen Sheriff Court later today.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:04:11+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:04</time> by <a rel="author">Peter Davidson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/peter-davidson/</a></address>
      <p>Cops in Aberdeen have arrested and charged a man in connection with the recovery of £37,000 worth of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/fresh-push-legal-fix-rooms-20952094">drugs</a> destined for Shetland.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old was cuffed on Sunday, at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/ferry-chaos-after-celtic-match-20954751">ferry terminal</a> in the city, after heroin and cannabis was seized during an intelligence-led operation by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/fresh-push-legal-fix-rooms-20952094">CID officers</a> and Police Scotland's Dog Unit.</p>
      <p>It's believed the male attempted to transport the drugs to the Shetland islands.</p>
      <p>He is due to appear at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/fresh-push-legal-fix-rooms-20952094">Aberdeen Sheriff Court</a> later today.</p>
      <p>Enquiry Officer John Hampton said: "Tackling illegal drugs and removing them from our communities is a priority for Police Scotland.</p>
      <p>"Part of that is targeting the transport routes used to courier drugs in and out of the North East – the ferry terminal in Aberdeen being one of those.</p>
      <p>"We will <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/fresh-push-legal-fix-rooms-20952094">carry out</a> disruption tactics like this as often as we can to stop criminals bringing harm and misery to our communities.</p>
      <p>"We rely on the support of the public to build intelligence on drug-related issues so that we can act on their concerns. I would urge anyone who is aware of any information about the supply of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/fresh-push-legal-fix-rooms-20952094">drugs</a> to report the matter to police on 101, or anonymously through independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."</p>
