      <h1>How the EastEnders characters voted in the Brexit referendum - and why</h1>

      <p>EastEnders has never been shy at tentatively dipping its toe into the world of politics, with the show inserting topical scenes seeing characters discuss major events such as the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> referendum. But while we got quite a stilted and balanced conversation at the Queen Vic after the vote to leave was announced, how would the characters have actually voted?</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/SoozUK">Comedian Sooz Kempner</a> (@SoozUK) has delved through the roster of characters to have a look at just that – and her observations are utterly on point. From Dot Branning’s (June Brown) confusion over racial issues and Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) Brexiting from abroad through to Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) constantly reminding everyone that she is an NHS nurse and Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner) voting remain because pizzas come from Italy, just about every response you’ve ever heard any vote here is represented by the Walford constituents.</p>
      <p>Here is the thread in full to be enjoyed:</p>

      <p>Our personal highlights include:</p>
      <h3>Grant Mitchell</h3>
      <p>Leave. Postal vote from Portugal.</p>
      <h3>Phil Mitchell</h3>
      <p>Remain. For a while it looked like he wasn’t going to get in to a feud with Grant over this but then Grant called him “a Remoaner” in the Mitchell WhatsApp group and now they’re not speaking again.</p>
      <h3>Peggy Mitchell</h3>
      <p>Remain. Regrets the time she welcomed Boris Johnson in to the Queen Vic, now wishing she’d “nutted the twat”, get outta my pub etc etc.</p>

      <h3>Bianca Butcher</h3>
      <p>Leave. Very keen on the theory that all politicians are liars and she doesn’t trust a single one of them. Was going to vote Brexit Party on December 12th but they’re not standing in her constituency so Farage is a traitor to her now too. Will now vote Tory.</p>
      <h3>Sonia Fowler</h3>
      <p>Remain. Begins every comment about Brexit by putting a hand to her chest and saying ‘as an NHS nurse’ and all her points are valid but people sure are tired of hearing them.</p>
      <h3>Martin Fowler</h3>
      <p>Remain. Posted earnest selfie of himself holding his burgundy passport the day before the referendum and friends are still giving him shit for it.</p>
      <h3>Stacey Fowler</h3>
      <p>Remain. Thinks raising her eyebrows and telling people ‘pizza…kebabs…Danish pastries…they’re all from Europe’ is a valid point well made.</p>
      <h3>Ian Beale</h3>
      <p>Leave. Sweats with regret every time he thinks about it. Refuses to vote Labour but desperate for a second referendum. For a while went round saying that ‘Boris Johnson will get us a second vote, mark my words’ but he didn’t believe that and neither does anyone else.</p>

      <p>Among other characters who were assessed by Sooz’s cutting analysis were Frank and Pat Butcher, Alfie Moon and all four Ben Mitchells.</p>
      <p>Brexit might not bring us many light moments – but we certainly enjoyed this one!</p>
