      <h1>Clenton hitting new highs after bouncing back from serious fall</h1>

      <p>Striking at one winner every four rides in her past 50 races, Samantha Clenton has never ridden better. As they say, no pain no gain, and the popular jockey is testament to someone who has rebounded through commitment and tenacity.</p>
      <p>Three years after her career was put on hold after a shocking fall left her grateful just to walk again, Clenton has powered back. Through a combination of hard work, grace and balance in the saddle, she is among the more dominant riders on many non-metro meetings around the mid-north, Central Coast and greater Hunter regions.</p>

      <p>And let's not forget she is one of a special pair - along with Jenny Duggan - who in June became the first mothers to win a Saturday metro race on the same program. Five months on, and little wonder Clenton has a book of rides at Tuesday's feature Port Macquarie meeting that is among the best of an interrupted career. She may even give her own single-meeting record - three at Armidale - a nudge.</p>
      <p>Heading the charge is five-year-old local gelding Condover Hall, who chased home The Kroc at Kempsey last start, and looks ready to peak getting to 2000m in a BM 58. Three-year-old Graziano, from a rival Port stable, is also a genuine chance in a maiden plate over 1500m, although most punters will be desperate to see Newcastle gelding Elgin get home after going under as a heavily backed favourite in two of his three runs this prep.</p>
      <p>Clenton then climbs aboard two resuming each-way hopes, four-year-old mare Firefly Poppy in a maiden plate, and five-year-old San Francisco under a big weight in an open handicap; before hopping on longer priced five-year-old Wauchope mare Odds Or Evens in a BM 58 heat of the Rising Star.</p>
      <p>But her best rides could be saved for last. Smart three-year-old Newcastle sprinter Mr Polar steps up to class 1 company after a dominant front-running maiden win at Muswellbrook. Then improving five-year-old Newcastle gelding Mr Grumpy looks hard to beat third-up in a BM 66 handicap over 1200m to close the meeting.</p>
      <p>That said, in one of the more competitive races on the card, five-year-old Gladstone gelding San Marco, and three locally-trained mares Penfold, Maid Marilyn, and the emerging Our Girl Babs, who is shooting for three straight wins, will all give Mr Grumpy a stern test.</p>
