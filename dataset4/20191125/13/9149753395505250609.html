      <h1>The Intel i5-9600K is under $200 for Black Friday, its cheapest ever price</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:50:44+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/phil-savage/" target="_blank">Phil Savage</a></address>
      <p>Newegg has rolled out its <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday deals</a> for Intel's Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs. The most notable is the Core i5-9600K for $199.99—at $80 off its original price it's one of the best deals we've seen for the processor. You can also get its big brother, the Core i7-9700K, for $339.99, which is a good deal on one of the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-cpu-for-gaming/">best gaming CPUs</a>.</p>
      <p>The i5-9600K offers 6-cores/6-threads with a base clock of 3.6GHz, a boost clock of 4.6GHz. The i7-9700K features 8-cores/8-threads with a similar base clock of 3.6GHz, but a boost clock of 4.9GHz. While both face stiff competition from their respective Ryzen counterparts, Intel's Core CPUs are great picks if you use your PC primarily as a gaming device. If you want to dig into the numbers a little, Jarred offered up a selection of benchmarks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-core-i7-9700k-review/">detailing the i7-9700K's performance</a>.</p>
      <p>Both CPUs need to be paired with an LGA-1151 socket, so if you're building a new system, be sure to check out our guide to the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-motherboards/">best gaming motherboards</a> for some helpful advice. You'll also want a good <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-cpu-coolers/">CPU cooler</a> to keep your processor from overheating.</p>
