      <h1>Indebted UK group sells Lisburn retail park for cut-price €46.7m</h1>
      <h2>Intu announces strategy of selling assets to cut debt as NewRiver REIT purchases units</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:25:20+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/mark-paul-7.2443308" target="_blank">Mark Paul</a></address>
      <p>Intu, a listed UK owner of shopping centres, has sold Sprucefield retail park in Lisburn, Co Down, for £40 million (€46.7 million), more than 40 per cent below the price it paid for it just five years ago .</p>
      <p>The retail park, located just off the M1 motorway about 10 miles from Belfast city centre, has been bought by another listed outfit focused on UK retail assets, NewRiver REIT.</p>
      <p>In a statement released to the market on Monday morning, Intu’s chief executive, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Matthew+Roberts">Matthew Roberts</a>, told investors the disposal was part of the group’s new strategy to sell off some of its assets to cut debt.</p>
      <p>Large UK retailers such as Argos, B&amp;Q and Sainsbury’s are among the tenants at Sprucefield park’s five units.</p>
      <p>Including the Lisburn deal, Intu has disposed of £268 million (€314 million) worth of its assets so far this year.</p>
      <p>Intu had been planning an expansion of the park that it bought for £70 million (€81.9 million) in 2014 from Westfield, but it faced some local political opposition over concerns that it would leech retail custom away from Belfast city centre.</p>
      <p>A note on Monday morning from Dublin stockbrokers, Goodbody, said the cut-price sale of Sprucefield “highlights further the dramatic erosion of value in the UK retail park segment”.</p>
