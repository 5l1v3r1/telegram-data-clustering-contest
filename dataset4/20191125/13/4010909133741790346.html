      <p>The highly anticipated new<b> Huawei</b> device that comes under the Nova series named <b><a href="https://technave.com/gadget/Huawei-nova-6-Price-in-Malaysia-Specs-16024.html">Nova 6</a> 5G</b> is going to make a debut on 5 December 2019. But now, <a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2019/11/24/leaked-reveals-huawei-nova-6-se-is-inspired-by-the-iphone-11-pro/">there is a rumour</a> that the Nova 6 5G is not going face the world alone. There is another device which is said to be the <b>Huawei Nova 6 SE</b> will be announced as well.</p>
      <p>At first, you might find the naming of the device sounds familiar. YES! HUAWEI may have borrowed the idea from Apple of using the SE suffix to name a compact device. However, it does not stop here. Not only the name, but the appearance of the device will also stir up the memories of the newly designed <a href="https://technave.com/index.php?app=gadget&amp;query=iphone+11">iPhone 11 series</a> that was launched in September this year.</p>

      <p>Nova 6 SE’s design looks similar as it uses the same square design to house its cameras at the back, but instead of three cameras, the Nova 6 SE has four cameras with a flashlight located outside the square. On the front, there is a punch-hole camera positioned at top left corner. To add on, the phone will house a Kirin 810 chipset which confirms it as a mid-range device. However, it is said that it will get a flagship feature which is 40W SuperCharge technology that is being used on the Mate 30 series. Other specs have not been revealed yet as this is still a fresh rumour.</p>
      <p>Let us hope for this device will truly be announced with Nova 6 5G on the launch day to give us more options to choose from the series. Share your thoughts on this rumoured device with us on our Facebook page! For more phone rumours, stay tuned on TechNave.com.</p>
