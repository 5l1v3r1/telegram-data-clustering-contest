      <p>Kylie Jenner organized a tasty event and shared some pics and footage on her social media account. The Shade Room quickly spotted that one of the spots at the table is for Beyonce.</p>
      <p>People said in the comments that itâ€™s either a code name for someone else or that if itâ€™s truly Beyonceâ€™s spot there, she will definitely not be attending the event.</p>
      <p>Someone said: â€˜I just hope the food taste as good as it looks! If it does then it doesnâ€™t matter if Beyonce showed up or notâ€¦.â€™ and one follower posted this: â€˜Sheâ€™s not going. Poor baby has her hopes all up too ðŸ˜‚.â€™</p>

      <p>Not too long ago, it was reported that an insider who spoke with People Magazine stated that Kylie â€˜doesnâ€™t seem to be dating.â€™</p>
      <p>The same insider revealed that Kylie has just been seeing Drake â€˜occasionally,â€™ however, it doesnâ€™t seem that serious between them.</p>
      <p>The person also said that Kylie might be hanging out with Drake just to <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/kylie-jenner-may-be-hanging-around-drake-just-to-make-travis-scott-jealous-a-source-claims-343564/">make Travis Scott jealous</a>.
