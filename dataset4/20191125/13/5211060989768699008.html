      </p>
      <p>A student at University of Toronto told CP24 she was in the library at the time of the incident and will "never forget the smell."</p>
      <p>"I thought it was coffee or something,” Kaylie, who did not provide her last name, said on Monday. "All of a sudden the smell hit."</p>
      <p>"I thought I was going to faint. Me and my friends packed up our stuff and ran out of the room."</p>
