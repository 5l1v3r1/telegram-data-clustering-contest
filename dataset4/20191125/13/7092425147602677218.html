        <b>Uber has lost its licence to operate private hire vehicles in London after authorities found that drivers who had faked their identity on the Uber app were responsible for more than 14,000 trips.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Uber's licence will not be renewed at the end of a two-month probationary extension.</p>
      <p>Transport for London found that the company had failed to deal with issues around checks on drivers, insurance and safety.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Monday, TfL said it had identified a "pattern of failures" by Uber, including breaches that placed passengers' safety at risk.</p>
      <p>In a statement, TfL said: “Despite addressing some of these issues, TfL does not have confidence that similar issues will not reoccur in the future, which has led it to conclude that the company is not fit and proper at this time.”</p>
      <p>Uber pledged to challenge the "extraordinary and wrong" decision.</p>
      <p>The company has a period of 21 days to lodge an appeal and it can continue to operate in that time.</p>
