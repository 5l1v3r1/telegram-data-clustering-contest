      <p>A TOTAL of 23 patients are on trolleys at Mayo University Hospital today.</p>
      <p>The figures have been revealed on a day when 85 patients are without beds in University Hospital Limerick – the highest figure ever recorded in an Irish hospital in a single day.</p>
      <p>The previous record was 82, set in October 2019, also in Limerick.</p>
      <p>Patients without beds are typically on chairs and trolleys, often in corridors.</p>
      <p>The INMO has called for a direct, immediate intervention in the hospital from senior HSE management, including:</p>
      <p>• Cancellation of non-essential elective work</p>
      <p>• More home care packages to move patients out of the hospital</p>
      <p>• Emergency funding for extra agency staff</p>
      <p>• An immediate end to the recruitment ban for nurses and midwives</p>
      <p>• Extra support for GPs and Public Health Nurses to allow more home/community treatment</p>
      <p>There are 631 patients without beds across the country today - 22 of them children.</p>
      <p>INMO Assistant Director of Industrial Relations for the region, Mary Fogarty, said: “Despite the best efforts of local staff, the situation in Limerick continues to escalate. The hospital is breaking records in the worst possible way.</p>
      <p>“Promises of future improvement will not suffice. Real action is needed today.</p>
      <p>“We simply do not have sufficient capacity. Without an increase in beds and the professionals to staff them, this problem will continue to escalate.</p>
      <p>“Our members are on the frontline providing the best care they can – but the situation is intolerable for them and unsafe for patients.”</p>
