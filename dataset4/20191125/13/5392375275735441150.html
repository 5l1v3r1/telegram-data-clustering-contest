      <h1>MediaTek 5G Chip Leads Zurich AI List, Surpassing Kirin 5G SoCs</h1>

      <p>MediaTek 5G Chip Leads Zurich AI List, Surpassing Kirin 5G SoCs<br/>3 (60%) 2 votes</p>
      <p>As early as the beginning of November, MediaTek announced that it will release its own 5G solution in Shenzhen on November 26. One day before the press conference, on the AI ​​Benchmark running list developed by the <a href="http://ai-benchmark.com/ranking_processors.html?from=singlemessage&amp;isappinstalled=0">Federal Institute of Technology (ETHZ) in Zurich</a>, a MediaTek 5G SoC “quietly” was on the list and led by 56158. The second place belongs to the Kirin 990 5G and the Kirin 990 chips. Interestingly, they are twice as much as the Snapdragon 855 Plus.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, the configuration specifications of this MediaTek 5G SoC are not disclosed on the list. But we don’t have to wait long as this new chip will hit the market tomorrow.</p>
      <p>According to the information released before, the MediaTek 5G chip is positioning high-end flagship products. It is manufactured by a 7nm process. There is a built-in 5G modem, Helio M70. It includes the ARMCortex-A77 CPU, the Mali-G77 GPU, and MediaTek’s independent AI processing unit (APU).</p>
      <p>Apart from this, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/25/mediatek-and-intel-partnership-will-bring-5g-to-laptops/">today</a>, the Taiwanese chip maker also announced important cooperation with Intel. These two will join hands to create PC chips based on the MediaTek 5G modem. The first products are expected to go on sale in early 2021. But for MediaTek, this is a unique chance to show its power and potential to the whole world.</p>
      <p>Intel is a leading chip maker. So if it chooses MediaTek as its next partner in developing 5G processors for the PC market, this simply means the Taiwanese manufacturer has not lost the game yet.</p>
