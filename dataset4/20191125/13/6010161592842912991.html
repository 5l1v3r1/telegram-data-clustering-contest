      <h1>Nintendo Switch Black Friday 2019 – the best deals on consoles, Switch Lite bundles, accessories, games and more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:19:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:19</time> by <a rel="author">Staff</a></address>
      <p>The week may have only just begun but that doesn’t mean the Nintendo Switch Black Friday offers aren’t already out in the wild. As we get even closer to 29th November, there’s a good chance we’ll see even more deals go live.</p>
      <p>So, how are sales looking for the Nintendo Switch? It’s hard to tell. While the Switch doesn’t usually get deep discounts for Black Friday, a bit of a discount is better than no discount, which is usually the case for the rest of the year.</p>
      <p>But thankfully, you don’t need to go hunting for the best deals yourself. We’ve done the work for you! Keep scrolling through our Nintendo Switch Black Friday deals hub for the best Switch deals and more!</p>
      <h3>The best Nintendo Switch Black Friday deals so far</h3>
      <p>We don’t usually see the Nintendo Switch on sale outside of big deals events like Black Friday. Living up to that expectation, there’s very little out there right now. If you’re in the UK, though, you can get a <a href="https://shop.ee.co.uk/partner-deals/android-deals">free Nintendo Switch with these Samsung and Huawei mobiles</a> or you can add piles of cardboard to your home with a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-blue-Labo/dp/B07ZG8YSJ3?tag=vg247-m-21">Nintendo Switch and free Labo Kit for £279</a>.</p>
      <p>As for the US, it’s dead. However, we do know that a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07VGRJDFY?tag=vg247-m-bf-20">Nintendo Switch with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for $299.99</a> will be the Black Friday console bundle. Walmart has a <a href="https://www.walmart.com/co/Nintendo-Switch-Console-with-Spyro-Reignited-Trilogy-Game/825977535">Nintendo Switch and Spyro Reignited Trilogy for $299</a> as well. There might be more variety in the coming days.</p>

      <h3>Black Friday 2019: when is it?</h3>
      <p>You’ll want to mark the 29th of November on your calendar for Black Friday 2019. Be prepared to be on the hunt for deals in the weeks prior and following that date, though, as retailers look to make the sales a much bigger event.</p>
      <p>In fact, some retailers have already begun some sales! Most Black Friday ads are at least live, and retailers have some early bird specials to entice consumers to start spending even earlier than before. We’ll keep the best deals updated so you don’t have to worry about it!</p>
      <h3>What Black Friday Switch deals will there be this year?</h3>
      <p>That’s a tricky question, but we have a few ideas of what Nintendo Switch Black Friday deals you might expect to see this year.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.vg247.com/current//2018/11/nintendo-switch-black-friday-game-deals-600x338.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Now that Black Friday adverts are out there from the likes of <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/07/best-buy-black-friday-ad-reveals-amazing-console-game-deals/">Best Buy</a> it’s become clear what’s going to be available. Those of you holding out hope for a cheap Nintendo Switch bundle, it’s bad news I’m afraid. We now know the offering is going to be a <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo-switch-with-mario-kart-8-deluxe-console-bundle-neon-blue-red/6302309.p">Nintendo Switch with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for $299.99</a>. Other retailers may also be getting this bundle, but it’s hard to say yet. Most of the major retailers don’t seem to be offering much of a discount on the system.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, we’ll be keeping a close eye on <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/06/check-out-this-pokemon-sword-and-shield-overview-trailer/">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a> as they will have only been out for two weeks by the time we reach Black Friday. While it seems unlikely that we’ll see a good deal on such a recent release, even $5 or $10 off saves money!</p>
      <p>There are many other popular Switch games that will be seeing more significant price cuts, though. The likes of <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/04/22/it-doesnt-matter-how-many-amazing-games-come-out-i-cant-stop-playing-breath-of-the-wild/">Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/04/05/super-mario-odyssey-is-nintendos-bold-attempt-at-bottling-the-weirdness-of-travel/">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and others have sat at full price for as long as we can remember and will now be coming down to $40. All of the expected games will reach this price point, with some other third-party titles such as <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2013/08/29/diablo-3-review-round-up-get-all-the-scores-here/">Diablo 3</a> and Overwatch (which just released last month) dropping to all-time lows.</p>
      <p>Also, you should definitely see what happens on the Nintendo eShop. Sales are becoming more regular on the digital store, so there will definitely be something on the eShop for Black Friday. The eShop sales are always a bit hit or miss, so we’ll have to wait and see if this sale will be worth looking into.</p>
      <h4>Should I get the Switch Lite on Black Friday?</h4>
      <p>If you’re holding out for a Nintendo Switch Lite Black Friday deal then you might end up being disappointed this year. The Switch Lite has only just been launched so we aren’t expecting to see any considerable money off it so soon compared to the standard Switch.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.vg247.com/current//2018/11/nintendo-switch-lite-black-friday-2019-600x340.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>However, Walmart is offering a slight deal on a Switch Lite bundle already. The <a href="https://www.walmart.com/co/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Console-with-Pokemon-Sword-or-Shield-and-BONUS-Switch-Lite-Kit/672862230">Switch Lite and Pokemon Bundle for $238.99</a> offers about $30 in savings between the system and game, and gets you a free carrying case to boot.</p>
      <p>The best you can probably hope for is to get a Switch Lite console with a first-party game for $199.99 or £199.99. Some offers are already up in this sort of area so it won’t be anything new. Depending on the game, though, it could work out nicely as a free extra.</p>
      <h4>Will the NES Mini and SNES Mini be on sale?</h4>
      <p>Nintendo’s retro consoles make for excellent gifts so we wouldn’t be surprised if some retailers brought them back at a discount during Black Friday. You probably won’t see anything quite as strong as the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/09/02/playstation-classic-gamestop/">PlayStation Classic for $20</a> during Prime Day! Still, there’s definitely room to save a few bucks on the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2018/11/23/best-prices-nes-mini-snes-mini-black-friday/">NES Mini and SNES Mini</a>. We just haven’t seen anything from retailers regarding this… yet.</p>
      <h4>Where will be the best place to get a Nintendo Switch Black Friday bargain?</h4>
      <p>We’d suggest checking the usual suspects such as Amazon as they’ve pushed some of the best Nintendo Switch Black Friday deals in recent years. Of course, traditional games retailers such as GameStop, Best Buy and Walmart could also compete. Their offers are most likely going to be shared between them, though.</p>
      <p>Over in the UK, you’ll want to keep track of Argos, AO, Very and the multitude of online games retailers for all their Black Friday Nintendo Switch bargains. We could see some exclusive offers from the biggest of these as they all compete for the big-ticket sales. For the largest department stores, you could pair up a Nintendo Switch Black Friday deal with something on a 4K TV, some accessories or homeware for even more savings!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.vg247.com/current//2018/11/nintendo-switch-black-friday-bundle-600x338.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>What were last year’s best Nintendo Switch Black Friday deals?</h3>
      <p>Last year the Nintendo Switch stuck around $300 for Black Friday. The best we saw was the addition of a free $35 gift card at for that same price, so you could essentially create your own Switch bundle. Still, that’s not the sort of eye-popping Nintendo Switch Black Friday offer we expect to see.</p>
      <p>Outside of that, you saw a few top Switch games such as Super Mario Odyssey and <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2018/09/21/super-mario-party-video-mini-games/">Super Mario Party</a> drop below the $50 mark for the first time. Games like this are now sitting at that price point more permanently at Amazon US, so look for further discounts on Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Over in the UK, a Nintendo Switch console fell to £250. When a game was added to the mix it crept up to £290. Again, not something that would make us want to scream from the rooftops but you could appreciate the small saving. Let’s hope for something better this year!</p>
      <p>And don’t worry about trying to follow it all yourself. Keep this page bookmarked and be sure to check in every so often so you know about all the latest Nintendo Switch Black Friday deals. If this isn’t your console of choice, you can also follow our pages dedicated to the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/25/ps4-black-friday-deals-2019/">PS4 Black Friday</a> and <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/25/xbox-one-black-friday-deals-2019/">Xbox One Black Friday</a> deals. It’s going to be a wild few weeks!</p>
