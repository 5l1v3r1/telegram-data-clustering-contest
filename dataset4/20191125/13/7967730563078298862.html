      <h1>New star ratings for childcare centres will never shine</h1>

      <p>Tragically, two children died in childcare services in NSW over the past financial year. These services are regulated by the NSW government that ultimately bears the responsibility to ensure centres are safe and high quality.</p>

      <p>So what has the government done? It’s decided that from next year every centre will be forced to display a coloured star chart on its front door showing how it rates against the National Quality Framework for Education and Care Services.</p>

      <p>When educators and early childhood teachers awoke to this news on Saturday morning many were angry. The provision of education and care is not a white-good sitting on a shelf. Its purpose is to nurture our precious children and prepare them for the future. It is not a commodity that should be regulated by the forces of the marketplace.</p>
      <p>The government reckons the charts will help parents become more informed about the<br/>ratings system and help drive centre quality improvement. Will it work? Research carried out by the Australian Children’s Education and Care Quality Authority shows that parents listen to peers' opinions when deciding if a service is good or bad, but above all their own judgment “ultimately superseded all other influences”. Of course, in areas of under supply, parents won't have a choice no matter what the star rating of the centre and the imperative for providers to improve will be lessened.</p>
      <p>The assessment and ratings system for education and care services is a national system. But NSW is going alone on the star chart. This is the same government that spends less on early education and care per child than any other state or territory. Dramatically less. Other states pour more money into improving the quality of their centres rather than inventing star charts.</p>

      <p>And we know what type of centre is more likely to be bad. Centres owned by private equity companies stand out. In NSW, Affinity Education operates 43 services, 40 per cent of which are rated as "working towards" (ie not yet meeting) the national quality standard. Camp Australia, another private equity provider, has 50 per cent of its 111 centres rated as working towards.</p>
      <p>If our government really wanted to make sure parents can make good choices about where to send their children and make sure children are safe and receive high quality care, it should get rid of the companies that are rubbish at providing quality care.</p>
      <p>Forcing centres to display a star chart devalues education and care, devalues the professionalism of educators and teachers and won't stamp out providers that shouldn’t be awarded a single star.</p>
