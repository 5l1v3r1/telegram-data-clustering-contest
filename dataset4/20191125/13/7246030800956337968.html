      <p>On Monday, Israel is expelling Omar Shakir, the Human Rights Watch director of Israel and Palestine, because he supports the BDS.</p>
      <p>Human Rights Watch Executive Director Kenneth Roth said he thinks this is the first time a democracy has thrown a researcher out of the country. In 2017, Israel passed a law subjecting foreigners who speaks out for the boycott to deportation. Itâ€™s what democracies do to protect themselves against their enemies.</p>
