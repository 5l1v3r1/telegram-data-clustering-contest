      <p>She said: “So happy about this, this is big, this is amazing, having him back.</p>
      <p>“It’s really the ultimate way to celebrate our 50 years.”</p>
      <p>Asked when she would announce more news about performers, she said: “More are coming soon. I think there might be another one this side of Christmas but realistically most of it is going to be at the beginning of 2020, everyone needs their moment.”</p>
      <p>She added: “Interestingly, the other two headliners, it’s their fist time at Glastonbury, we have got one male and one female who are coming.</p>
      <p>“There are a couple of clues there. I’m sure people will guess. Don’t start putting them to me, I’m a really bad liar.”</p>
