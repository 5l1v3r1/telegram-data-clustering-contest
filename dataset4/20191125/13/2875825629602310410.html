      <h1>Former Bohemains captain Derek Pender appointed head coach of PFA Ireland's annual training camp</h1>
      <h2>The squad will play a match away to League One side Rochdale</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:43:21+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/paul-ohehir/" target="_blank">Paul O'Hehir</a></address>
      <p>Former Bohs skipper Derek Pender has been appointed head coach of the PFA Ireland annual training camp.</p>
      <p>He will be assisted by former League of Ireland stalwart Pat Flynn while St Pat’s Brendan Clarke is the goalkeeping coach.</p>
      <p>John Russell will oversee a camp that runs simultaneously in Castlebar for players based in the West of Ireland.</p>
      <p>The squad will play a match away to League One side Rochdale, most likely on December 11.</p>
      <p>A player exchange facility is also in operation for the first time whereby one member of the squad will be sent to Finland in the hope of earning a contract over there.</p>
      <p>In turn, a Finnish player will come the other way in an attempt to land a deal with an Irish club.</p>
      <p>PFA Ireland general secretary Stephen McGuinness said: “It's something we hope to build with Norway and Sweden as well.</p>

      <p>“Unfortunately the finances around the old tournament are quite significant so that has been curtailed.”</p>
      <p>Former St Pat’s player James Doona has been identified as a potential candidate to travel to Finland.</p>
      <p>But Pender - who retired from playing last month - will have the final decision on who he sends abroad.</p>
      <p>McGuinness added: "We're looking at someone who has played full-time, is available to travel and wants to play abroad and James is definitely one that has spoken to us.</p>
      <p>“But Derek will make a decision on the best equipped player to go across and that will be no different to the Finnish player coming here as they have training camps on.</p>
      <p>"There are a number of factors including quality of player, whether they have the time and if it's realistic that they would take a contract in Finland if it's offered.”</p>
      <p>McGuinness also thanked the FAI for its help behind the scenes having received little or no assistance under the old regime in recent years.</p>
      <p>"The facilities here (Abbotstown) have been opened up to us for the first time in quite a few years,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We're using the dressing rooms, the pitches. We’re in the indoor arena tonight and were on external on FAI pitches before that.</p>
      <p>“We’re being assisted with everything be it washing kit, balls, cones - the FAI have provided everything which is a significant change to what it had been in the past.”</p>
      <p>According to McGuinness, that assistance has saved the PFA Ireland between €4,000 and €5,000.</p>
