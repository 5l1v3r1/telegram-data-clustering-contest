      <p>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas â€” A quick-thinking woman was able to <a href="https://www.kristv.com/news/local-news/local-walmart-employees-foil-kidnapping">save herself from a bad situation</a> Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Corpus Christi Police Department (CCPD) Lt. Mel Goce said that a woman in her 30s was able to alert staff at a local Walmart that she had been kidnapped.</p>
      <p>"She was writing little notes and giving them to employees to call the police that she was kidnapped," Goce said.</p>
      <p>The woman reportedly told police that she had been kidnapped because she testified against a suspect in court.</p>
      <p>Police arrested two suspects, one male, and one female, who attempted to flee from officers.</p>
      <p>Charges are pending against the pair, as CCPD continues to investigate.</p>
