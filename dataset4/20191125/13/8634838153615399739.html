        <b>The University of Nairobi announced that it had shut down the self-sponsored programmes department.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a statement issued on Monday, November 25, the university's council chair, Julia Ojiambo, explained that move to do away with the Centre for Self Sponsored Programmes (CESSP) centre was to take effect immediately.</p>
      <p>"That statute which establishes the Center for Self-Sponsored Programmes is revoked with immediate effect," the statement read in part.</p>
      <p>In line with the new directive, the university chair recommended that members of staff previously serving under various CESSP programs be re-assigned into the mainstream services of the university.</p>

      <p>The move came with a backdrop of the lowering of cut-off points for university government sponsorship to a minimum of C+ reducing the number of students enrolling for a self-sponsored study. </p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/"><i>Kenyans.co.ke</i></a>, a Master's student at the university who declined to be named, clarified that the university administration had assured them that the decision would not affect programmes offered by the institution.</p>
      <p>The highly-ranked university made headlines on October 31, 2019, after Embakasi East Member of Parliament <b>Paul Ongili, </b>popularly known as <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/45861-babu-owino-confronts-uon-vc-over-expulsions"><b>Babu Owino </b>called a truce with the acting  Vice-Chancellor Professor Isaac Mbeche</a>.</p>
      <p>According to Babu's Facebook post, his brief talks with the VC yielded fruits after Mbeche agreed to take back students who had been suspended or expelled from the institution.</p>
      <p>"All comrades who were suspended/expelled from the University of Nairobi to write a letter addressed to the Vice-Chancellor requesting to proceed with their studies," he posted.</p>
