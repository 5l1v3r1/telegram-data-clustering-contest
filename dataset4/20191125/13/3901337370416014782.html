      <p>“On Saturday (23 November), it was pleasing to watch the first semi-final match between Golden Arrows vs Mamelodi Sundowns.

      <p>“Those who officiated on Sunday’s other semi-final match between Kaizer Chiefs vs Maritzburg United at Mbombela Stadium, seemed to have vowed to maintain the same, if not better, level of good officiating displayed on Saturday. The match was flowing and I want to praise Luxolo Badi, who is one of our up-and-coming referees, Elphas Sitole, Kenny Mamegwa, Sandile Dilikane and Match Commissioner Jabu Nzima for the professionalism in which they handled the match on Sunday,” he said. </p>
