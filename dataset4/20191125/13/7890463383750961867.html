      <h1>You can now play Half-Life’s “scrapped” Alpha version – sort of</h1>

        <b>If news that <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life-alyx/">Half-Life: Alyx</a> is on the way has got you excited to jump back into Valve’s long-running <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life">Half-Life</a> universe, there may be a mod for you. The In Deep mod offers users the chance to play the “scrapped” 1997 alpha version of the original Half-Life game, “re-imagined and re-vamped.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-in-deep">In Deep mod</a>, by In Deep Developers and posted by user Jackathan, has been in the works for a while but a shiny new demo has just been added, which recreates the “entire ‘Office Warrens’ chapter from the Half-Life 0.52 Alpha, remade from scratch with improved puzzles and gameplay.” It’s not an exact replica of the original – which eventually became Half-Life’s chapter four – but doesn’t “stray too far from the original’s designs and layouts either.”</p>
      <p>The rework tweaks the Alpha’s puzzles and combat to make them a little easier to grapple with, and more akin to the retail version of the game. The modder summarises, “In Deep’s Office Warrens is a less linear and somewhat extended version of Office Complex from retail Half-Life.”</p>
      <p>If you’re keen to jump into some very early Half-Life, the In Deep mod is in Early Access. Head over to <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-in-deep/news/office-warrens-demo-release">ModDB</a> to grab it.</p>
