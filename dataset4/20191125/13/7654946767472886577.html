      <p>A 2-year-old boy was crushed to death when an ice sculpture collapsed at a Luxembourg Christmas market, according to new reports.</p>
      <p>The toddler was at the Place Guillaume II market with his family around 8 p.m. Sunday when the sculpture, installed next to the ice skating rink, suddenly fell apart — with one of the broken shards landing on top of him, <a href="https://today.rtl.lu/news/luxembourg/a/1436406.html">local outlet RTL reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The unidentified tot died at the scene.</p>
      <p>The incident left horrified family members and witnesses “in tears,” and they are under the care of a local psychological support group, <a href="http://www.lequotidien.lu/slider/luxembourg-drame-au-marche-de-noel/">according to Le Quotidien</a>.</p>
      <p>Authorities are working to determine how the sculpture collapsed, RTL reported.</p>
      <p>The public prosecutor’s office announced Monday it has opened an involuntary manslaughter investigation into the incident, according to the report.</p>
      <p>The sculptor from the company Ice &amp; Art, who constructed the work in question, told the outlet that this was the first time one of his pieces collapsed.</p>
      <p>“We are all shocked, me first and foremost,” he told the outlet. “This does not happen.”</p>
      <p>The designer suggested that the heavy slab “could not fall alone — it’s impossible,” according to the report.</p>
      <p>The artwork was made of “only pure water, without air, so that it is completely transparent and we would see the slightest defect,” the sculptor added.</p>
      <p>In a press release obtained by the outlet, the City of Luxembourg said that “no words can appease the pain [the family is] experiencing.”</p>
      <p>“Words cannot describe how tragic the incident was,” <a href="http://www.lequotidien.lu/slider/luxembourg-drame-au-marche-de-noel/">Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel tweeted</a>.</p>
