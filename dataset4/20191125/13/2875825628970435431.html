      <p>Kimberley Walsh compared her "genuine" friendship with Cheryl to her "working relationship" with Nadine Coyle.</p>
      <p>The Girls Aloud singer, 38, couldn't resist making another vicious dig at the I'm A Celeb star when she appeared on Monday's Loose Women.</p>
      <p>Kimberley appeared to confirm the rift rumours within the Girls Aloud band which Nadine claims led to their split.</p>
      <p>In a savage snub, the songstress ruled her bond with Nadine was strictly professional in comparison to her flourishing friendship with Cheryl and Nicola Roberts.</p>
      <p>She said: "Yeah [I was more friendly with Cheryl and Nicola]. It is true genuine real connection between us three."</p>

      <p>The trio - whom Nadine claimed often left her out - have continued to stay close pals following the end of their band.</p>
      <p>And Nadine even said she hadn't spoken to the Girls Aloud crew in years.</p>
      <p>So no eyebrows were raised when Kimberley reduced her friendship with Nadine to a "work relationship" or a family member she doesn't see.</p>

      <p>She added: "With Sarah and Nadine, it was more of a work relationship but it's like family you'd feel for them. You don't see them all the time."</p>
      <p>Girls Aloud rift rumours have been circulating once again when Nadine headed into the I'm A Celeb jungle in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>In fact, Kimberley confessed she was surprised how much she cares watching Nadine on I'm A Celeb.</p>
      <p>The singer insisted she was upset over the claims the trio had a nasty Whatsapp group about Nadine.</p>
      <p>"It surprised me how much I do care... I'm a real girls' girl." Nadine said.</p>
      <p>Nadine hasn't been shy about coming forward about how isolated she felt when Cheryl, Nicola and Kimberley became BFFs.</p>
