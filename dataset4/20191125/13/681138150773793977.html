        <b>A teenager who stabbed a 19-year-old in the head in Essex has been jailed for four-and-a-half years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The teenage victim was walking with friends along an alley between Fitch's Mews and Fitch's Crescent in Maldon around 3pm on April 22 when he was approached by Joshua Goodchild.</p>
      <p>Goodchild produced a kitchen knife from behind his back, asking "Who wants to get dipped first?" before stabbing the victim to the side of the head and making off.</p>
      <p>The victim's friends called for an ambulance, and local residents came out and helped the victim while they waited for the paramedics to arrive.</p>
      <p>He sustained a single deep cut to the side of his forehead and his wound was later glued following trip to hospital.</p>
      <p>During the investigation a knife, believed to have been the same weapon used in the attack, was found under the bypass over the Blackwater River.</p>
      <p>Goodchild, 19, of New Writtle Street, Chelmsford, was arrested on May 1 and denied any knowledge of the stabbing during interview.</p>
      <p>He was later charged with GBH with intent and pleaded guilty at Chelmsford Crown Court on Tuesday, September 24.</p>
      <p>At the same court on Thursday, November 21, he was given an eight and-a-half year extended sentence, four and-a-half years to be served in prison and a further four on licence.</p>
      <p>Detective Constable Claire Hicks, investigating officer at Essex Police, praised the courage of the victim and thanked the members of public who helped at the time of the attack.</p>
      <p>She said: "Joshua Goodchild is a dangerous perpetrator who has refused to accept that there was anything fundamentally wrong with his behaviour.</p>
      <p>"He attacked his victim, with a knife, in front of other impressionable young people, including a 14-year-old child.</p>
      <p>"This was an unprovoked attack which could have left the victim with really serious injuries.</p>
      <p>"Goodchild will now spend a significant amount of time in prison and Essex will be a safer place for that.</p>
      <p>"I want to praise the courage of the victim and thank the members of the public who went to his aid.</p>
      <p>"Essex Police will continue to use the full force of the law to deter and detect knife crime."</p>
