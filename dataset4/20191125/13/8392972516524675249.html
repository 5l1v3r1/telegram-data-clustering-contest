      <h1>Nicole Scherzinger 'voted Thom Evans off X Factor: Celebrity to save their romance'</h1>
      <h2>Couldn't stand mocking of their alleged relationship, apparently</h2>

      <p>X Factor: Celebrity judge Nicole Scherzinger picked Thom Evan’s act to leave the show in order to 'save their romance', according to a tabloid report.</p>
      <p>The Sun claims Nicole chose to dump the former rugby player's band Try Star from the ITV series because she couldn't stand having their alleged relationship being a target of ridicule.</p>
      <p>An unnamed show insider is reported to have told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">the newspaper's website</a>: "Nicole is really into Thom and she didn’t want jokes being made about them.</p>
      <p>"She chose to get rid of his group Try Star because it would stop people scrutinising what she has with Tom.</p>

      <p>"And she knew they were the weaker act."</p>
      <p>However, despite Thom’s stunned look as Nicole, 41, nominated Try Star for the chop from <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/x-factor/">the show</a>, the 34-year-old hunk is reportedly not holding the ex Pussycat Doll’s decision against her.</p>
      <aside>It would stop people scrutinising what she has with Tom.</aside>
      <p>And the news outlet also reckons the pair were partying together in London following <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/x-factor/x-factor-celebrity-levi-davis-hits-back-at-audience/">the Saturday night TV elimination</a>.</p>
      <p>Fellow judges Simon Cowell and Louis Walsh seemed to acknowledge <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/nicole-scherzinger-secretly-dating-x-factor-celebrity-star-thom-evans/">reports Nicole and Thom have been 'secretly dating'</a> with some nudging and sly references during last weekend's episode of the celebrity talent competition.</p>

      <p>He said: "Nicole, I agree with you but you really love this act <i>a lot</i>. And I like the fact you love them so much. She genuinely cares about them, Simon."</p>
      <p>A grinning Simon cut in: "I agree she is invested in this act. She likes the act."</p>
