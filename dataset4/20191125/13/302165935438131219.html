      <p>BRUSSELS, Nov 25 — Brussels restaurant 65 Degres has become the city’s best-rated eatery, largely thanks to rave reviews of its staff, most of whom have Down Syndrome.</p>
      <p>The restaurant - part fine-dining establishment, part social inclusion project - ranks first out of more than 2,000 competitors listed on review site TripAdvisor.</p>
      <p>“The customers are here to see us and to savour the restaurant’s atmosphere and gastronomy,” said waitress Marie-Sophie Lamarche.</p>
      <p>“It is a lot of pressure. We are proud of ourselves,” added Lamarche, who has Down Syndrome.</p>
      <p>The restaurant - named after the perfect temperature to cook an egg - was set up by four entrepreneurs with backgrounds in cooking and social care. It serves up high-end French-style food in the Belgian capital’s hip Chatelain district.</p>
      <p>The idea was to give people the skills to break into the hospitality business, co-founder founder, Adelaide Aymer, told Reuters.</p>
      <p>“We work with people who are so happy to be working, so they have this pleasure of coming to work every day,” fellow founder Valentin Cogels told Reuters. — Reuters</p>
