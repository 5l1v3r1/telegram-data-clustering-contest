      <h1>Morrisons to offer boxes of unsold food for just £3.09 in all stores</h1>
      <h2>The boxes contain unsold fruit and veg, bakery and deli items</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:38:38+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:38</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>Morrisons has launched a new app which allows shoppers to buy boxes of unsold fruit for a bargain.</p>
      <p>The supermarket is the first in the UK offer food past its ‘best before’ date through a ground-breaking app.</p>
      <p>Customers will be able to use the Too Good to Go app to purchase the boxes of unsold fruit and veg, bakery and deli items worth at least £10 for £3.09.  The contents of the boxes will be revealed when picked up from the local supermarket.</p>
      <p>The service has been trialled in a handful of stores and <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/morrisons">Morrisons </a>has today announced that it will be available in all 494 Morrisons supermarkets nationwide from Tuesday November 26.</p>
      <p>The move aims to help customers on a budget and to provide another channel for food that might otherwise be wasted.</p>
      <p>Morrisons expects to distribute 350,000 boxes of unsold food in 2020. This will reduce CO2 emissions by 882 tonnes: the equivalent of driving from London to Edinburgh 5,351 times.  Morrisons is committed to reducing operational food waste by 50% by 2030.</p>

      <p>Jayne Wall, Market Street Director at Morrisons, said: “We are using technology to help us reduce food waste and to help more people afford to eat well. It will also mean we waste less food this Christmas as it will find a home for products that can’t be sold after the festive period.”</p>
      <p>Hayley Conick, UK Country Manager at Too Good To Go, added: <b> </b> “Every single day perfectly edible food goes to waste simply because it isn’t sold, and this is having detrimental effects on our planet.</p>

      <p>"In fact, food waste contributes to 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. We need greater awareness of the issue of food waste, so we are delighted to welcome Morrisons as our first UK supermarket partner.</p>
      <p>"Together we can fight food waste and ensure that quality surplus produce doesn’t end up in the bin.”</p>

      <p>All people need to do is download the free app and browse local stores with food available. They select a local store from which to purchase unsold food.</p>
      <p>They pay through the app and then collect their food from the store during the given collection window. </p>
