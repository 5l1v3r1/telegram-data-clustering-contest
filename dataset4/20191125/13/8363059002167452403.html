      <p>If you've been waiting for a price drop to kick in for Google's Pixel 4 and 4 XL, you're in luck with Three's Black Friday deals.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/pixel-4-review-it-wins-by-being-more-human/">Pixel 4</a> only just launched, and while you wouldn't usually expect to see it discounted just yet, the gods of Black Friday have intervened over at Three to bring you a sweet little deal on the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL. When the handset <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/best-deals-uk-pixel-4-pixel-4-xl-networks/">launched on the network</a>, the 64GB Pixel 4 had a £49 upfront fee and was available on three tariffs; a 30GB plan that cost £47 a month, and two unlimited plans costing £49 and £69 a month.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the Pixel 4 XL was available on five tariffs. Four had an upfront cost of £49 with data ranging from 4GB at £48 a month, up to unlimited data for £56 a month, while the unlimited deal scratched the initial payment for the phone and charged £75 a month instead.</p>
      <p>With Three's Black Friday deal, you can pick up a 6<a href="http://store.three.co.uk/view/plan/ContractD31102019T144153?outOfStock=true">4GB Pixel 4 with 100GB of data</a>, and unlimited minutes and text on a 24 month contract for £40 a month and an upfront cost of £29. The <a href="http://store.three.co.uk/view/plan/ContractD31102019T144156?outOfStock=true">Pixel 4 XL is on offer for £40 a month</a> with the same upfront cost of £29. And you can knock an extra fiver off your monthly payment by setting up a recurring payment method like direct debit, so you're looking at potential monthly costs of £35 for the Pixel 4, and £40 for the Pixel 4 XL.</p>
      <p>100GB is a huge amount of data, so if you guzzle it up to the point where you need this much, this might be just the deal for you.</p>
      <p>It's only the start of Black Friday week - not to be confused with Black Friday month which has been raging for what feels like forever now - so keep up to speed with all of the offers that have dropped and will be dropping over on our <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/search?searchTerm=black+friday">Black Friday hub</a>.
