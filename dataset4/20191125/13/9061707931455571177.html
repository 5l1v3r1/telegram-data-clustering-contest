      <h2>Derby County latest | Our regularly-updated guide of when the Rams will next be on television and how to watch both live action and highlights, as Phillip Cocu's side look to climb the Championship table</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Nicholson</a></address>
      <p>Derby County are enjoying an impressive run of home form in the Championship - and they will be hoping to show that in front of the Sky Sports cameras over the festive period.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Rams </a>have already been on the box five times in the league this season, the most recent being the East Midlands derby defeat to Nottingham Forest before the final international break of 2019.</p>
      <p>Before that, the opening-day win over Huddersfield Town was followed by draws against West Bromwich Albion, Cardiff City and Leeds United on the box.</p>
      <p>We will keep this story regularly updated so you know when Derby are next on your screens.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The next selected TV match for the Rams is home to Sheffield Wednesday on Wednesday December 11.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Derby will also feature live on Sky Sports a couple of times over the Christmas period, including a December 30 clash with Charlton Athletic at Pride Park and their first match of 2020 against Barnsley, which could see new signing Wayne Rooney make his Rams debut.</p>
      <p>All midweek Championship games are screened on the red button as part of a deal with the EFL which began last season.</p>
      <p>Red button events are not available via Sky Go or the Sky Q app - but you can watch midweek Sky Bet Championship matches via the Sky Sports app.</p>
      <p>Here are the Sky Sports matches currently pencilled in for the Rams:</p>
