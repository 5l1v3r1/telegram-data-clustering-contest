      <h1>Spain seizes submarine full of cocaine</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:19:26+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>MADRID: </b>Police in Spain have seized a submarine loaded with cocaine off the coast of the northwestern region of Galicia which arrived from South America, officials said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Two people were arrested as part of the operation on Sunday in the seaside town of Cangas near the border with Portugal, a police spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>The submarine was “likely” transporting “several tonnes (of cocaine) but this is just an estimate”, a source close to the investigation said.</p>
      <p>Spanish media said the submarine was carrying over three tonnes of cocaine from Colombia.</p>
      <p>The submarine, about 20 metres (65 feet) long, came from South America, another source close to the investigation said, without specifying which country the vessel departed from.</p>
      <p>“It is not the first time but we don’t see this every day” in Europe, the source added.</p>
      <p>Drug traffickers, especially from Colombia, have been caught using submarines to transport cocaine into Mexico, and from there into the United States.</p>
      <p>In September the US Coast Guard, with the aid of the Colombian navy, intercepted a submarine carrying over five tonnes of cocaine off the coast of South America.</p>
      <p>Galicia, one of the country’s poorest regions, is a top entry point for cocaine into Europe. A maze of coves, caves and inlets dot its rugged coastline, making it a smuggler’s paradise.</p>
      <p>Spain accounted for the second-highest proportion of cocaine seizures in the European Union last year after Belgium, with 41 tonnes apprehended.</p>
