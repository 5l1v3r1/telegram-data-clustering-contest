      <h1>‘Amid Evil’ Receives Free Ancient Alphas DLC That Chronicles The Game’s Development</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:49:34+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/theaxegrinder/" target="_blank">Mike Wilson</a></address>
      <p>Throwback FPS <b><i>Amid Evil</i></b> has received a unique <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1198780/AMID_EVIL__Ancient_Alphas/">free DLC update</a> that takes a look at the stuff spanning the game’s development from 2016-2017. Available now on Steam, the Ancient Alphas DLC not only lets you play through areas that didn’t make the cut, but also try a very different version of the room-clearing Aeturnum BFG weapon, explore alternate visions of some levels, and overall experience the full journey <i>Amid Evil</i> took before reaching its final release.</p>
      <p>That doesn’t close the book on updates for the game, however. Developer Indefatigable have released a teaser screenshot of how their game will look with the newfangled ray-tracing enabled using the RTX line of graphics cards. No word on just when the RTX-enabled version of <i>Amid Evil</i> will be available, other than the ambiguous “SOON™”.</p>
      <p>Currently available on PC, Amid Evil will also be receiving a Nintendo Switch port in 2020.</p>
