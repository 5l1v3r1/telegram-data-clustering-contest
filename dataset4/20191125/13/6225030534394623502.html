      <p>Unbeaten Nashua Stakes (G3) winner Independence Hall and upset Breeders’ Cup Juvenile hero Storm the Court are among the 24 betting interests in Pool 1 of the <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/p/c/Kentucky_Derby_2020_Contenders">2020 Kentucky Derby</a></b> Future Wager, which kicks off a four-day run at Churchill Downs on Thanksgiving Day.</p>
      <p>Both <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Independence_Hall_1">Independence Hall</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Storm_The_Court">Storm the Court</a></b> were made 12-1 individual co-favorites on veteran odds maker Mike Battaglia’s morning line.

      <p>The Kentucky Derby Future Wager will be offered concurrently with the fifth annual Kentucky Derby Sire Future Wager, which provides bettors with a unique opportunity to wager on select breeding stars and their entire crop of juveniles with the hope of winning next year’s Kentucky Derby.</p>
      <p>Offspring sired by Constitution – including Independence Hall, Tiz the Law and Breeders’ Futurity (G1) runner-up Gouverneur Morris – are 6-1 on the morning line for the Kentucky Derby Sire Future Wager. Offspring sired by popular 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah are listed at 8-1.</p>

      <p>The Kentucky Derby Future Wagers provide fans of Thoroughbred racing with opportunities to place bets on possible entrants in the Kentucky Derby Presented by Woodford Reserve (Grade I) at odds that could be far greater and more attractive than those available on the day of the race. The 146<sup>th</sup> running of Kentucky Derby, America’s greatest race and the first leg of the Triple Crown, is set for Saturday, May 2, 2020, at Churchill Downs.</p>
      <p>Bets can be placed at Churchill Downs Racetrack, through Advanced Deposit Wagering services and other online wagering outlets and satellite wagering centers across North America.</p>
      <p>There are no refunds in the Kentucky Derby Future Wager. Should Churchill Downs officials determine during the duration of this week’s four-day pool that one of the wagering interests has experienced an injury, illness or other circumstance that would prevent the horse from participating in the Kentucky Derby, betting on the individual horse will be suspended immediately.</p>
