      <p>Here are <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/22/find-edge-title-pursuit-liverpool-man-city-leicester-arsenal/">some things Arsenal are missing</a>: defensive organisation, a clear identity, obvious leadership, confidence, entertaining football and points from games they should have won. </p>
      <p>Privately Arsenal will have a shortlist of potential replacements for Unai Emery and if the first team fails to win their next two fixtures, or at least look capable of it, there is every chance he is told to leave, even though the 'football department' of Edu, Raul Sanllehi and Huss Fahmy really don't want to sack him.</p>
      <p>If his position does become untenable, they must decide <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/08/29/unai-emery-has-tweaked-arsenals-tactics-used-diamond-vs-liverpool/">who best suits the club's vision and strategy</a>, can play the style of football they want to see, and who might best reconnect with a frustrated group of supporters. </p>
      <p>So, who are the realistic candidates?</p>
      <h3>Serious candidates</h3>
      <h4>Mikel Arteta</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/11/25/TELEMMGLPICT000175127979_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqDWe775LjDCVm_2Dq6YUMoDklbkAL_mdIQF62n8c9KGE.jpeg?imwidth=480"/>

      </figure>
      <p>A classy former player and club captain who has spent the last few seasons learning how to coach from Pep Guardiola, Arteta was close to being offered the job before Emery was hired.</p>
      <p>Arteta might only need the chance to step up to prove he can lead Arsenal back into the top four and if Guardiola is the template, the team might play a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1, stretching the pitch in possession with a high defensive line and putting pretty passing patterns together. </p>
      <p>It works at Manchester City because the players are individually brilliant and Guardiola's meticulously coached, structured setup is the king - in Guardiola's first season in charge, it didn't go to plan. Would Arteta be able to get his own ideas across to the players available?</p>
      <p>City's push for the title could mean that Emery keeps his job until the summer, with Arteta perhaps unwilling to rock the boat and leave his role under Guardiola halfway through a season to take charge at the Emirates.</p>
      <h4>Patrick Vieira</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/11/25/TELEMMGLPICT000217079087_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=480"/>
        <figcaption>Patrick Vieira had some success at New York City but Nice is proving a tough task Credit: REUTERS</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The fans are divided and the club lacks identity. Hiring someone who Knows The Club would be a smart move and in Vieira they'd have a former player who represents everything good about the Arsene Wenger era.</p>
      <p>"I want a team creating an attacking game where the players express their qualities," he said on arrival at Nice, but that club's tendency to sell their best players has meant Vieira hasn't been able to build a team in his image so far. After a spell at New York City in MLS, he led Nice to a seventh place finish in Ligue 1 last season and is three points away from sixth in the current campaign (Nice are 15th).</p>
      <p>Perhaps with better players he'd be able to do something special but there's nothing to suggest so far that Vieira has the magic touch as a coach to turn Arsenal into a top four side. Has mostly used a 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1 and 3-5-2 in a system neither overly attacking nor solid defensively. Absolutely fine. A bit Claude Puel-ish. </p>
      <h4>Massimiliano Allegri</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/11/25/TELEMMGLPICT000176655734_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqulmngyk1nEPNRM5Qu5tZfryMzVxb2mpCjJ50eJguw1w.jpeg?imwidth=480"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Allegri has been a free agent since leaving Juventus, having won his fifth Serie A title in a row. Tactically flexible, he shifted away from a 3-5-2 to a 4-2-3-1 during his time at Juve and would do something similar at Arsenal, but more important is that Allegri is a proven winner.</p>
      <p>He has won the league at all three of his clubs, starting with Sassuolo in Serie C1, AC Milan in 2010/11 and then that impressive stint with Juve. It's the kind of CV that should arrive in the Arsenal inbox with flames coming off it and he may wish to hold out for a job that gives a better shot at the title in England. Additionally, his style of football is more defensive than Arsenal fans have been used to during the Arsene Wenger era.</p>
      <h4>Nuno Esperito Santo</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/11/25/TELEMMGLPICT000217083033_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqEPB_dQRIyM2Cs0FMpHolCfprK4dXxve9DIuIlXlWVE0.jpeg?imwidth=480"/>
        <figcaption>Nuno Espirito Santo has done a superb job at Wolves and might be looking for a next step Credit: GETTY IMAGES</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Wolves have sneakily climbed up to fifth in the Premier League this season, despite adapting to weekly European football after an excellent post-promotion campaign in 2018/19. The club have certainly been helped by their relationship with Jorge Mendes and a conveyor belt of affordable, talented players who may not otherwise have travelled to play for Nuno Esperito Santo, but the manager's role should not be underestimated in Wolves' ascent to Premier League upper-table. </p>
      <p>He ticks the box in the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/05/23/football-managers-havent-won-trophy-43-years-old-probably-never/">'great managers win a title by the age of 43</a>' theory and his career is on upwards trajectory. Arsenal would be a logical next step.</p>
      <h4>Rafa Benitez</h4>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Rafa Benitez has coached Champions League winners and relegation avoiders, and turned average sides into ones that compete. In many ways he would be absolutely perfect for Arsenal but it may count against him that he is an outsider and therefore doesn't Know The Club.</p>
      <p>Benitez used a 5-4-1 at Newcastle but has had teams playing entertaining football (that gets results) in a 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3 and improved sides wherever he has gone. Is earning huge money in China and if Arsenal's longterm plan is to appoint a former player like Arteta, Benitez probably wouldn't be tempted by a short term deal.</p>
      <h3>Candidates with an outside chance</h3>
      <h4>Chris Wilder</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/11/25/TELEMMGLPICT000217181162_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqulmngyk1nEPNRM5Qu5tZfqR-WNg5v_PM37_SwAi-czY.jpeg?imwidth=480"/>
        <figcaption>Chris Wilder has impressed with his work at Sheffield United Credit: GETTY IMAGES</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Wilder wouldn't be the most glamorous of appointments, nor does the job he's done at his boyhood club necessarily mean he could transform Arsenal in half a season, but for a team lacking bite and defensive organisation, he represents an interesting choice. </p>
      <p>Wilder has turned Sheffield United from a mid-table Championship side into one causing the Premier League's top six big problems. He'd instantly go about drilling the defence into shape and certainly appears to communicate more clearly than Emery, but working with sturdy, no-nonsense centre-backs is different to cultured/error-prone ones like David Luiz. He's not all about making his side hard to beat either - some of the patterns of attacking play and passing in tight spaces that Sheffield United put together are lovely to watch.</p>
      <h4>Mauricio Pochettino</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/11/25/TELEMMGLPICT000216763485_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqquIyQjlsq9p2NQkR_PXpiRcGShOTL68ebYugLKy3NVk.jpeg?imwidth=480"/>
        <figcaption>Mauricio Pochettino has reportedly been lined up as the next Bayern Munich head coach Credit: REX</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Won't happen. Regardless that Pochettino is the ex-Spurs manager, he absolutely must use his high reputation to secure a job that allows him to win titles immediately and build on the zero he was won before now. Bayern Munich should win the league, Arsenal are years away from it.</p>
      <p>Turning Tottenham into a Champions League final team is the work of a brilliant coach but Spurs weren't always great to watch, often grinding out results and relying on the individual brilliance of Harry Kane and others to win tight games. Many a match was won by Spurs breaking up play at the halfway line before counter-attacking quickly and clinically.</p>
      <p>Like Emery, Pochettino struggled to work out his best XI at Spurs recently despite trying a number of different formations, and seemed burned out by the end. Could turn out to be a title-winning coach with better resources but would damage his career path if he were to join Arsenal now.</p>
      <h4>Freddie Ljungberg</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/11/25/TELEMMGLPICT000216992204_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqk--b1aDvxTQVszVMARw2xGWiu2yd4u6oY8Wtagrw4b0.jpeg?imwidth=480"/>
        <figcaption>Freddie Ljungberg stepped up from Arsenal's academy in the summer Credit: GETTY IMAGES</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Ljungberg was promoted from the under-23s to Emery's assistant in the summer and the feeling at the club is he might not be ready to take over just yet. This alone could be enough to keep Emery in a job until the end of the season, allowing Ljungberg to develop as a coach. Might not be the answer at this stage in his career; if he were to take over as interim manager and it went badly, Ljungberg would ruin his chance of being given the job when the time was actually right.</p>
      <h4>Brendan Rodgers</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/11/25/TELEMMGLPICT000217090588_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO2wBkCq2Mm4bNdLs0EhrYyQynkOUP7jc1iwm7BKtzoM.jpeg?imwidth=480"/>
        <figcaption>Rodgers has Leicester playing an entertaining style of football in keeping with Arsenal's philosophy Credit: GETTY IMAGES</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In charge of a perfectly balanced side with realistic fan expectations and plenty of room to develop into something special - why would Rodgers leave the talented Leicester side he currently manages? The prestige (and budget) that managing Arsenal provides could prove relevant but Leicester are on course to finish in the Champions League spots while Arsenal are not. Rodgers knows how to build a winning team but might be best placed to do that where he is.</p>
      <h4>Thierry Henry</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/11/25/TELEMMGLPICT000216597316_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqn2n2hk5qKEJ--A9z8HbLAsG1A3ARvkKPXv0GiMUZykA.jpeg?imwidth=480"/>
        <figcaption>Thierry Henry has only just started his managerial career and taken a job in MLS Credit: AFP</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Thierry Henry would be welcomed home like the one true king to unite them all, the shining beacon of Arsenal's lost identity. Things went horribly for him at Monaco but that was also true of Leonardo Jardim, the title winning coach who was made to hand over the keys to Henry in the first place, and lessons will have been learned.</p>
      <p>It's rare that an elite player is equally as good a coach and Henry has said he wants his teams to play like Guardiola's Barcelona. "Pep is the reference point, for me. I’m not saying for everyone. There’s no right or wrong but he's the reference for me. We learned how to play the game when I went to Barcelona under him."</p>
      <p>Like Arteta, this would mean Henry's Arsenal would be a possession-based, high pressing 4-3-3, drilled on positional play. Again, it needs players capable of learning and executing it and Henry only started his job at Montreal Impact a fortnight ago.</p>
      <h3>Unlikely potential candidates</h3>
      <h4>Diego Simeone</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/11/25/TELEMMGLPICT000217262832_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWy_u4a9GUNQgLIY2EGV3qovR0qvPmQyEFl0PC-XDya0.jpeg?imwidth=480"/>
        <figcaption>Diego Simeone's team plays in his image but Arsenal fans should be wary that defensive football isn't always fun to watch Credit: AFP</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Anybody able to upset La Liga's duopoly knows what they're doing and although Simeone rejuvenated Atletico Madrid, his is a very dogged, defensive style of play.</p>
      <p>Atletico play a 4-4-2, defend in a low block and grind out results - it's not always pretty to watch - with even the most creative players expected to defend first and score later. This works, as Simeone's record at Atletico shows, but if a lot of his skill comes from instilling a hunger and desire to work and win, language might be a barrier. </p>
      <h4>Eddie Howe</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/11/25/TELEMMGLPICT000217092231_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqVfKYF8F8biotmZZgOU3KX39Nkpp6YJHYeBoI_4NXnUg.jpeg?imwidth=480"/>
        <figcaption>Eddie Howe's career might be stagnating at Bournemouth below a glass ceiling Credit: GETTY IMAGES</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Needs to move up a level if he is to win anything else in his career. Howe has taken Bournemouth about as far as he can, with anything above a mid-table finish an over-achievement. </p>
      <p>The players available and budget would give Howe a shot of competing for trophies but it would be a gamble. Is great at developing young talent, which is certainly relevant at Arsenal.</p>
      <h4>Carlo Ancelotti </h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/11/25/TELEMMGLPICT000217096595_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqcRhLREbzBl_qvRzRSeCcWZxWLfs5mAvkbXYQqrLnBas.jpeg?imwidth=480"/>
        <figcaption>Carlo Ancelotti is currently managing Napoli Credit: AP</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Doing well at Napoli and probably not the long-term choice for what Arsenal want to do. Loves a 4-4-2 diamond but has evolved and adapted in every job he's had since his AC Milan days, could be tempted with a return to the Premier League but has a good thing going at the moment. </p>
