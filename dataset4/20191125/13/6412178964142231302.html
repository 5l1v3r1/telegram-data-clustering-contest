        <b>The internal wrangling at Napoli has taken on a new dimension after club president Aurelio De Laurentiis reportedly issued fines totalling over €2.5million to the first-team squad.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As stated by the <i>Corriere Dello Sport</i> fines have been sent out to the players by De Laurentiis after the recent mutiny in Naples.</p>
      <p>Napoli’s chief put his squad in a training retreat the week before the international break, but the decision was not obeyed by the club’s players and trouble after the Champions League match against RB Salzburg further infuriated De Laurentiis.</p>
      <p>Apparently 24 letters have been sent out to the squad each detailing individual fines proportionate to the seriousness of the breaches. The Italian paper claims <b><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/kalidou-koulibaly">Kalidou Koulibaly</a> </b>has been fined €225,000.</p>
      <p>According to Italian league rules, in article 11 of the collective agreement in paragraph 3, the fine “cannot exceed 25% of the gross monthly salary”.</p>
      <p>The <i>Gazzetta Dello Sport</i> reports that Koulibaly the rest of the players are preparing to defend themselves with lawyers with chaos ready to ensue in Naples.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/man-utd-plot-blockbuster-summer-move-for-perfect-maguire-partner"><b>Fresh reports in October saw Koulibaly’s name mentioned as a target for Manchester United</b></a>, who allegedly want to pair him up with Harry Maguire to form a mean defensive unit.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/koulibaly-has-no-time-for-fresh-man-utd-talk-as-he-outlines-his-aims"><b>But while the defender himself has always insisted his only focus remains on Napoli</b></a>, De Laurentiis has admitted the day will come when he accepts an approach for the 28-year-old centre-half.</p>
      <p>“I loved Koulibaly the man so I refused €105m, but a time will come when I’ll have to sell him. Whoever says we didn’t improve our defence is wrong,” he told <i>Sky Sport Italia</i>.</p>
      <p>And now the latest mutiny in Naples could see the Senegal defender, who was believed to be a target for United in the last two summer windows, shipped out sooner that expected.</p>
