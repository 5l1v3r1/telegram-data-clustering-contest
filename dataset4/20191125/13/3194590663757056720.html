      <p>TheCable had earlier <b><a href="https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/breaking-efcc-confirms-arrest-of-mompha-instagram-celebrity/">reported</a></b> how the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arrested Mompha in Abuja while he was trying to leave the country for alleged internet fraud and money laundering.</p>
      <p>Less than a week after Mompha’s arrest, the anti-graft <a href="https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/efcc-how-we-arrested-momphas-lebanese-collaborator-with-charms/"><b>agency nabbed Hamza Koudeih</b></a>, a Lebanese, alongside two other suspected accomplices of the Instagram celebrity.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Mohammed Liman, the presiding judge, directed that he be remanded in the custody of the Nigerian Correctional Services (NCS).</p>
      <p>The judge gave the directive after the suspected internet fraudster had pleaded not guilty to the 14 charges of laundering filed by the EFCC.</p>
      <p>The court also fixed November 29, for the hearing of the defendant bail application.</p>
      <p>In a sheet signed by Rotimi Oyedepo, one of the commission’s counsels, the EFCC had claimed that Mompha laundered the funds through a firm which was the second defendant – Ismalob Global Investment Ltd – between 2015 and 2018.</p>
      <p>It also claimed that the funds, domiciled in a commercial bank, were moved in tranches of N18,059,353,413 and N14,946,773,393.</p>
      <p>The Instagram celebrity had last week <a href="https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/mompha-sues-efcc-over-unlawful-detention-demands-n5m-damages/"><b>filed a fundamental rights enforcement suit</b></a> against the commission, alleging unlawful detention.</p>
