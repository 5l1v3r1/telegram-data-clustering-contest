      <p>Climate change is featuring prominently in this election, with leaders asked to take part in the first ever debate solely on the topic as part of the election debates.</p>
      <p>So where do the parties stand on climate change?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Conservatives</b>
      </p>
      <p>The party has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050.</p>
      <p>As part of plans to meet this target, the party says it will spend £9.2 billion to improve the energy efficiency of homes, schools and hospitals.</p>

        <figcaption>Mr Johnson says the party will plant tens of thousands of trees to combat climate change</figcaption>

      <p>Boris Johnson’s manifesto also vows to plant 75,000 acres of trees a year and ban plastic waste exports to non-OECD countries.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Labour</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Labour party has promised to create 1 million green jobs in a bid to tackle the climate crisis.</p>
      <p>Setting out the party’s manifesto, Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would impose an £11 billion windfall tax on oil and gas companies.#</p>

      <p>The party also says it will work towards net zero carbon well before 2050, after dropping its initial plans to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2030.</p>

      <p>The party’s manifesto also states: ‘We will deliver nearly 90 per cent of electricity and 50 per cent of heat from renewable and low-carbon sources by 2030’, as well promising to build 9,000 new wind turbines.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Liberal Democrats</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats say they will spend £20 billion a year for five years to tackle climate change.</p>
      <p>The party has set itself a target of achieving net-zero carbon status by 2045.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Also among the initiatives are plans to deliver 80 per cent of UK electricity from renewables by 2030 and to plant 60 million trees a year.</p>
      <p>Funding of £12 billion has also been promised to support renewable energy.</p>
      <p>Firms will also be set climate targets.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Green Party</b>
      </p>
      <p>The party’s main policy is focused on spending £100 billion a year to cut emissions by 2030.</p>
      <p>That means all petrol and diesel vehicles would be replaced.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/PRI_98411522-e1574687126833.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C508&amp;ssl=1"/>

      </figure>
      <p>The party also says it will end fossil fuel industry tax breaks and subsidies and offer a nationwide retrofit insulation programme for homeowners and renters.</p>
      <p>It is by the far the most radical plan on climate change compared to the other parties.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Brexit Party</b>
      </p>
      <p>Climate change doesn’t feature much in the Brexit Party’s manifesto, though it has pledged to ensure all waste in the UK is recycled.</p>
      <p>Nigel Farage has also promised a mass tree planting campaign to capture CO2, though he hasn’t released figures of how many he wants planted yet.</p>
