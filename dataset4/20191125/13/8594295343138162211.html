      <p>I try to mix up <a href="http://www.murileemartin.com/JunkyardGalleryHome.html">these Junkyard Finds</a> so that you <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2015/04/junkyard-find-1997-oldsmobile-bravada/">won’t</a> <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2013/08/junkyard-find-1996-oldsmobile-silhouette/">see</a> <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2012/04/junkyard-find-1990-oldsmobile-toronado-trofeo/">five</a> <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2011/04/junkyard-find-1993-oldsmobile-achieva-scx/">1990s</a> <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2012/09/junkyard-find-1994-oldsmobile-ninety-eight-regency-elite/">Oldsmobiles</a> in five consecutive weeks. This week, after <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2019/11/junkyard-find-1990-volvo-240-dl-wagon-with-393888-miles/">a 1990s Volvo</a> and <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2019/11/junkyard-find-furiously-modified-1995-honda-accord-coupe/">a 1990s Honda</a> and <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2019/11/junkyard-find-1973-plymouth-duster-340/">a 1970s Plymouth</a>, it seemed time for a really old car or maybe something from 2000s Detroit.</p>
      <p>Then I remembered that <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/author/sajeev-mehta/">Sajeev</a> has been complaining about insufficient recognition from other writers of his weird love for Ford products of the 1960s-1990s, so I opted to open the floodgates for <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/tag/sajeevs-bitter-tears/">his bitter tears</a> with the nicest fleet-grade mid-1980s Escort I’ve ever seen in a junkyard.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Since Sajeev is the only TTAC writer who has been writing for the site longer than I have (he started in 2006, I started in 2010), I should show him some respect for his love of so-called classic Dearborn iron. Instead, I torment him with text messages from junkyards (written entirely in the dialect known as Randomly Punctuated Craigslistese), including photographs of interesting Fords, Lincolns, Mercuries, and Merkurs.</p>

      <p>I would say that this car is a true stripper, a check-no-boxes zero-option miserybox, but it <i>does</i> have the optional automatic transmission instead of the cheaper four-speed manual transmission. My guess is that the government agency, utility, or rental-car company that bought it new had a slushbox requirement for its vehicles.</p>

      <p>Do you prefer to drive with a passenger-side mirror? Too bad! That costs extra.</p>

      <p>Air conditioning? What are you, made of ice cream? Open the windows!</p>

      <p>Although most cheapskate-grade subcompacts get beaten to death and crushed before about age ten, this Escort stayed amazingly well-preserved for better than three decades. Look at the perfect seat fabric, the uncracked dash.</p>

      <p>With a five-digit odometer, we’ll never know the actual mileage total. I’m willing to say that 65,010 miles is correct, because nobody could keep a car looking this clean for 165,010 or 265,010 miles.</p>

      <p>The very cheapest Escort for the 1986 model year was the Pony 3-door hatchback, and I just shot <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/11/19/junkyard-gem-1986-ford-escort-pony-hatchback/">a horrifyingly hantaviral example of the breed (complete with liquid rat poop flowing over the speedometer face)</a> in Colorado. The L 3-door hatchback was the <i>second</i>-cheapest Escort that year, starting at $6,327 versus the Pony’s $6,052 price tag (that’s $14,856 against $14,210 in 2019 dollars). Both cars have a 1.9-liter four rated at 86 horsepower, though a 52-horse diesel could be had (the Escort GT got a 108 hp version of the 1.9).</p>

      <p>It goes to <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2011/03/end-of-the-line-welcome-to-the-crusher/">The Crusher</a> with an anti-breast-cancer pink-ribbon ornament on the antenna. Why there’s an antenna on a car that didn’t come with a radio, I can’t say. If you want a car with music, sing while you drive!</p>

      <p>The world’s best-selling car in 1986 (though the European version wasn’t very similar).</p>
