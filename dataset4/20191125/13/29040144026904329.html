      <p>The Easy One Touch Wireless works with all phones between 2.3 and 3.5 inches. That includes most modern phones, including devices like the iPhone 11 Pro or Samsung Galaxy S10. You don't have to remove your case, either, as long as it's within those dimensions with the case attached. The wireless charging should still work.</p>
      <p>The mount uses a suction cup and dashboard disc to attach itself very securely to your dashboard or windshield. The combo of the two devices helps ensure a good fit. And the positioning doesn't have to be perfect because the mount also has a telescopic arm. The arm extends 4.9 to 8.3 inches on a 225 arc so you can find the best viewing angle wherever you place it.</p>
      <p>The iOttie patented mechanism for securing your phone lets you easily lock or release your device in place with one simple touch. Whether you're in a hurry or just want to make an adjustment on the fly without losing focus on the road, iOttie makes using this device as simple as possible.</p>
      <p>If you have a Qi-enabled device, you'll be able to wirelessly charge your phone while it's mounted. This includes a Fast Charge for Android devices and a standard charge for iPhone and other Qi-enabled devices. It's a great mount for long road trips or long traffic jams. Keep your phone topped off while still being able to access all the functions you want.</p>
