      <p>"At approximately 5:00 p.m. yesterday, an unknown male entered Scott library and deposited a substance, suspected of containing fecal matter, on a student," a spokesperson for York University told CTV News Toronto on Monday. </p>
      <p>"York University Security Services responded to the incident. We have reached out to the victim of the assault to offer support. We are also investigating the incident and working with Toronto Police Service."</p>
      <p>A student at University of Toronto told CP24 she was in the library at the time of the incident and will "never forget the smell."</p>

      <p>"I thought it was coffee or something,” Kaylie, who did not provide her last name, said on Monday. "All of a sudden the smell hit."</p>
      <p>"I thought I was going to faint. Me and my friends packed up our stuff and ran out of the room."</p>
      <p>Authorities said the two police divisions investigating the case will likely work together due to the similar nature of the incidents.</p>
      <p>No suspect descriptions have been released.  </p>
