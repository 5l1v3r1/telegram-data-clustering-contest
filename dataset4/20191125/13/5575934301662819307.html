      <p>Former White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders in a Fox News News discussion claimed that President Donald Trump reads more than “anybody I know” in response to new claims about the president’s reportedly limited attention span, and preference for briefing documents with pictures and bullet points.</p>
      <p>“The idea he can only take in one or two bullets is absurd. I’ve watched him consume massive amounts of information, process it quickly, make a decision,” Sanders said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyWOarvkv58">Sunday appearance on Fox News host Steve Hilton’s show.</a></p>

      <p>“He reads more than anybody I know. Every single foreign trip we had actually would laugh about the fact he has boxes upon boxes, file boxes where he reads for hours,” she continued.</p>
      <p>“The rest of us want to take a break, they want to sleep, and the president works the entire time. He will spend hours on the plane reading through notes, reading through newspapers, magazines. He consumes a massive amount of information constantly.”</p>
      <p>Sanders and fellow guests on the show were discussing “A Warning,” a new book by a White House official claiming to expose Trump’s unfitness for office, and an administration roiled by the president’s ignorance and impulsiveness.</p>
      <p>The White House has repeatedly denied claims made in the book, and described it as a work of “fiction.”</p>
      <p>In the book, the official writes that when Trump became president officials were advised not to present him with long briefing documents, and instead use slides to convey information.</p>
      <p>However when the president proved unable to take in information from slides they were told to reduce the information even further – to a single bullet point.</p>
      <p>“Come in with one main point and repeat it – over and over again, even if the president inevitably goes off on tangents – until he gets it. Just keep steering the subject back to it. ONE point,” the author <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/20/a-warning-by-anonymous-review-donald-trump">claims White House officials would say.</a></p>

      <p>The account echoes news reports, which have claimed that foreign leaders have used colourful cards to explain complex foreign policy issues to the president.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/trump-trade-tariffs-eu-colorful-cards-2018-7">In July 2018, the Wall Street Journal</a> reported that EU Commissioner Jean Claude Juncker had used colourful cue cards to brief the president on the importance of the relationship between the US and the EU. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/japan-colourful-chart-to-explain-us-investments-to-trump-2019-6">While in June, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe</a> used a colourful chart to explain Japanese investments in the US to Trump.</p>
      <p>Sanders claim that the president has a voracious appetite for print media – despite bashing the press as the “enemy of the people” – <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/29/trump-print-newspapers-media-1437913">was backed by a Politico report earlier in the year</a>, which claimed the president has a box of press coverage delivered to him every morning by an aide.</p>
      <p>He will scan publications for mentions of himself and his officials, and when a clipping meets his approval will reportedly scrawl a congratulatory note on it and send it to the official in question.</p>
      <p>Sanders stepped down as press secretary in June. In the role, she took a combative attitude to defending the president, and faced criticism for her distortion of the facts.</p>
