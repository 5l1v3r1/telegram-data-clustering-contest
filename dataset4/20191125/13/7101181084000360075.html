      <h1>Jennifer Lopez to Receive Palm Springs International Film Festival Honor for 'Hustlers'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:59:18+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:59</time> by <a rel="author">Paige Gawley‍</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.etonline.com/people/jennifer-lopez">Jennifer Lopez</a> will soon add a new award to add to her collection.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old triple-threat star will take home the Spotlight Award, Actress for her role in <i>Hustlers </i>at <a href="https://www.etonline.com/event/palm-springs-international-film-festival">Palm Springs International Film Festival's</a> Film Awards Gala on Jan. 2, 2020.</p>
      <p>"Jennifer Lopez is a star in every sense of the word, and you will experience this in her latest film <i>Hustlers," </i>Festival Chairman Harold Matzner said in a press release announcing the latest news on Monday. </p>
      <p>"Starting with her show-stopping entrance Jennifer brings to life the character of Ramona, an exotic dancer, who leads a group of dancer friends to steal money from their clients," Matzner said of her role in the film. "For this full-force yet grounded performance, deserving of awards consideration, we are thrilled to present Jennifer Lopez with this year’s Spotlight Award."</p>
      <p>Lopez's latest honor could very well point to another upcoming distinction, as past recipients of the Spotlight Award -- including Amy Adams, Jessica Chastain, Helen Hunt, Allison Janney, Rooney Mara and Julia Roberts -- all received Oscar nominations following their PSIFF wins.</p>

      <p>When ET's Keltie Knight caught up with Lopez at the Toronto International Film Festival back in September, <a href="https://www.etonline.com/media/videos/jennifer-lopez-doesnt-want-to-jinx-oscar-talk-surrounding-hustlers-exclusive-132075">she got real</a> about the nerves that come with her Oscar buzz.</p>
      <p>"Nobody even likes to say it! We don't want to jinx it!" Lopez exclaimed.</p>
      <p>Previously announced honorees at the upcoming PSIFF include <a href="https://www.etonline.com/joaquin-phoenix-to-be-honored-at-palm-springs-international-film-festival-136291">Joaquin Phoenix</a>, Martin Scorsese, Charlize Theron and <a href="https://www.etonline.com/renee-zellweger-to-be-honored-at-palm-springs-international-film-festival-135902">Renée Zellweger</a>.</p>
      <p>ET’s Mary Hart is set to return to host the PSIFF Film Awards Gala, and ET will be exclusively backstage with the stars during the big show on Jan. 2 at the Palm Springs Convention Center.</p>
