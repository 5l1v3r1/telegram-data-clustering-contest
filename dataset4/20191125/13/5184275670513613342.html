      <p>Talking about Ranveer Singh’s career graph, he started with <i>Band Baaja Baaraat</i> and portrayed the character of a young Delhi guy. He was so much into the skin that Ayushmann thought to himself, that he’s a Punjabi from Delhi. Everyone laughed at this and appreciated the fact that even though he was from Bandra, Mumbai; he cracked the accent and nailed the role.</p>
      <p>Deepika then revealed that when she met him afterwards for the first time, she always thought that he was from Delhi and was shocked to know that he was from Bandra to which Ranveer funnily replied, “that’s what got her hooked’. Deepika immediately responded by saying, “I would have been very happy with a south Indian guy” and laughs off.</p>
      <p>Ranveer then laughs and says, “Just wait for two days, I’m going to Tirupati in a dhoti!” and everyone starts laughing!</p>
