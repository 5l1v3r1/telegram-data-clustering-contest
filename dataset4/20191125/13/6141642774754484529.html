      <p>A man from Northern Ireland has appeared in court charged with human trafficking offences after the bodies of 39 migrants were found in a refrigerated lorry container in Essex.</p>
      <p>Lorry driver Christopher Kennedy, 23, was arrested in the early hours of Friday morning on the M40 in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire.</p>
      <p>The defendant, from Darkley, County Armagh appeared before Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court charged with conspiracy to commit a human trafficking offence.</p>
      <p>It is alleged that he conspired to arrange or facilitate the travel of other people with a view to exploitation.</p>
      <p>He is also charged with conspiring to facilitate the commission of a breach of UK immigration law.</p>
      <p>It is alleged that he did this between May 1 2018 and October 24 this year at Purfleet in Essex.</p>
      <p>Kennedy was not asked for pleas during Monday’s hearing.</p>
      <p>He spoke only to give his name, age, address and to state his nationality as British.</p>
      <p>He was remanded in custody to appear before the Old Bailey on December 13.</p>
      <p>Ten teenagers, including two 15-year-old boys, were among the bodies of 39 Vietnamese nationals who were discovered in the trailer in the early hours of October 23.</p>
      <p>Emergency services were called to an industrial estate in Grays, Essex shortly after the lorry arrived on a ferry from Zeebrugge in Belgium.</p>
