      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 25 — Every story needs its hero and its villain. So when Fernando Meirelles decided to make a film about Pope Francis and Pope Benedict coming face-to-face, the director knew which pontiff he would side with.</p>
      <p>For the first time in seven centuries the Catholic church has two living popes, and <i>The Two Popes</i> imagines a series of spirited debates between the strict, conservative Benedict and his charismatic successor.</p>
      <p>“At the start of the film for me Benedict was the ‘bad pope’ and Francis was the ‘good Pope’,” said Oscar-nominated Meirelles (<i>City of God</i>).</p>
      <p>But as the movie progressed, and the Brazilian director learnt more about both men, something started to change.</p>
      <p>“I read some of his writings. And I watched some of his sermons. And he’s interesting,” the director told AFP at the film’s recent premiere.</p>
      <p>“I think the press created this image of a Nazi, which is not really ... he’s not very different from Pope Francis actually.”</p>
      <p>The two men on screen bridge their differences, bonding over Benedict’s piano-playing and Francis’ beloved football team in conversations at the Pope’s summer residence, and in the Sistine Chapel.</p>
      <p>The Netflix film, starring Welsh screen legends Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce as Benedict and Francis respectively, has quietly emerged as an Oscars contender.</p>
      <p>It was written by New Zealander Anthony McCarten, whose last three films — <i>The Theory of Everything</i>, <i>Darkest Hour</i> and <i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i> — have all won the best actor Oscar for their leading men.</p>
      <p>McCarten told AFP that “career-best performances by both men” in his latest film were undoubtedly worthy of Academy recognition.</p>
      <p>There are “no more fitting recipients than either of them,” he said at the American Film Institute’s AFI Fest.</p>
      <p>Hopkins said the glowing response to the film had been a “big surprise,” expressing hope that it could teach the world something about tolerance.</p>
      <p>“Let’s talk, sit down, stop being so grim about everything,” said the <i>Silence of the Lambs</i> Oscar-winner.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Church scandals</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pope Benedict’s shock 2013 resignation came against a backdrop of child sex abuse scandals and financial corruption. These events are touched upon in the film, but only fleetingly.</p>
      <p>At one point, Francis hears Benedict’s confession — including his knowledge of historic sex abuse allegations against Mexican priest Marcial Maciel.</p>
      <p>But the audio quickly fades to silence, leaving the audience to fill in the gaps.</p>
      <p>“I had to be very careful not to go (too) far,” said Meirelles. “We had more lines on child abuse (in the script) but if I had two extra paragraphs on that it would become a film on child abuse.</p>
      <p>“He knew that a specific Mexican cardinal had issues with kids, and he didn’t do anything, to avoid a big scandal.”</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, Benedict emerges as a surprisingly likeable figure — something Meirelles attributes to Hopkins’ considerable charm.</p>
      <p>“As a dramatist, I had to love both characters equally,” added writer McCarten. “I had to start to learn and see the world through his eyes.</p>
      <p>Benedict “stands for tradition, orthodoxy, for something dependable, for a moral compass. Which is timeless, an eternal truth. And there’s a strength in that.”</p>
      <p>The film also covers, in flashbacks, a dark period in Francis’ past.</p>
      <p>As head of Argentina’s Jesuits, he was accused of cosying up to the country’s brutal military dictatorship in the 1970s.</p>
      <p>“Francis was and still is known as a divisive person in Argentina. It’s talked about in the film, it’s not shied away from,” Pryce told AFP.</p>
      <p>The <i>Game of Thrones</i> star said he studied Francis’ “flaws and weaknesses” — as well as his more admirable traits, like tackling inequality and climate change — to develop the character.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sistine Chapel</b>
      </p>
      <p>The project presented a number of unique challenges, Meirelles admitted — not least the huge amount of dialogue.</p>
      <p>“The script is very good, but at the end of the day it’s two guys just talking,” joked the director.</p>
      <p>Numerous devices to keep the pair moving on screen were devised. At one point they order pizza to the Sistine Chapel.</p>
      <p>With no access to film in the Vatican City, a detailed replica of the world-famous pilgrimage spot had to be constructed from scratch.</p>
      <p>“That was beautiful, we spent 17 days shooting inside the set” said Meirelles. “It’s a perfect replica, exactly the same. So now I know it, like my home!”</p>
      <p><i>The Two Popes</i> is released in limited US theatres November 27, and on Netflix December 20. — AFP</p>
