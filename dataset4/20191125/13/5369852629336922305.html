      <p>SERGIO AGUERO WILL sit out the Manchester derby at Etihad Stadium on 7 December though injury, Pep Guardiola has confirmed today. </p>
      <p>The Argentina international limped off the pitch during City’s 2-1 home win over Chelsea on Saturday with a suspected muscular injury.</p>
      <p>Aguero is City’s leading scorer in the Premier League this season, with nine to his name from 12 outings to date.</p>
      <p>It has been feared that the 31-year-old could now face an extended spell on the sidelines, as City approach a hectic festive period which could have a huge bearing on this season’s title race.</p>
      <p>When asked if Aguero will miss a crucial clash with United next month, Guardiola responded: “Yes.”</p>
      <p>He added on how long the Argentine is likely to be sidelined: “A few games. I don’t know exactly.</p>
      <blockquote>He has a tendon problem and will be a few games out. We will miss Sergio.</blockquote>
      <p>“We have had some problems with injuries but we will wait for him and meantime we have Gabriel [Jesus] and [Raheem] Sterling who can play in that position. </p>
      <p>“We have no other injuries. David Silva had cramp but he’s okay.”</p>
