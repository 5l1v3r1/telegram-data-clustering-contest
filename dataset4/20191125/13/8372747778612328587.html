      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- If you're planning to drive during this holiday travel season, grab a little extra gas money.</p>
      <p>As of Monday, the average gas price in Florida remains at $2.36, about the same it was a week ago, and down 4 cents in the last month, <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/?state=FL">according to AAA</a> .</p>
      <p>But AAA says drivers may see prices rise 5 to 10 cents this week, based on recent increases in the price of wholesale gasoline.</p>
      <p>"Even if gas prices do rise this week, a 5-10 cent increase is not likely to cause Floridians to cancel their travel plans," said Mark Jenkins, spokesman, AAA - The Auto Club Group. "If the state average returns to $2.45 per gallon, it'd be the same price motorists paid during last year's holiday. Additionally, it's nearly the same price Floridians paid a month ago - when most people were finalizing their travel plans. However, if the state average remains less than $2.45, Thanksgiving travelers in Florida would be paying the lowest gas prices for the holiday in three years."</p>
      <p>Across Southwest Florida, the Punta Gorda area has the lowest average price, at $2.31 a gallon. Fort Myers average $2.33, and Naples averages $2.40.</p>
