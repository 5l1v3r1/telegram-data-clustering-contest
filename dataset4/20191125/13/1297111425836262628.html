      <p>Robservations …</p>
      <p>• <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-quarterback-cody-fajardo-didnt-let-anyone-down">Cody Fajardo</a>, the runner-up for CFL most-outstanding-player honours, was the unrivalled MVP of the 2019 Grey Cup festival in Calgary. The Saskatchewan Roughriders’ starting quarterback dove into the Riderville venue and interacted with fans. On Friday, in particular, the Twitter timeline consisted mainly of fans’ selfies with Fajardo. Despite a heartbreaking, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-poor-play-calling-was-the-saskatchewan-roughriders-undoing">20-13 loss to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the West Division final</a>, Fajardo put the best possible face on the week that followed. He is a franchise player in every sense.</p>
      <p>• Calgary-based Govind Achyuthan — one of countless Roughriders fans who was photographed with Fajardo at the festival — had this to say: “He just seems too good to be true. Glad he’s our quarterback.”</p>
      <p>• Last week’s edition of CFL Wired, shown by TSN, provided interesting insights into the West final. Consider what <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/meet-the-riders-dan-clark-1.5194567">Roughriders centre Dan Clark</a> told Fajardo on the field after his final pass, on the last play of the game, hit the crossbar. “I love you, man. No one thought you’d be here to be able to do this, all right? We stand behind you. I love you. I’m proud of everything you did, all right? You keep your head up.”</p>
      <p>• CFL Wired also showed Blue Bombers defensive end Jackson Jeffcoat being the first player to console Fajardo after the final pass. Jeffcoat tapped Fajardo on the shoulder pads and said, “Good game.”</p>
      <p>• Shameless self-promotion: I will be signing copies of my new book, “100 Things Roughriders Fans Should Know &amp; Do Before They Die,” on Wednesday (at McNally Robinson in Saskatoon) and Thursday (Indigo, Regina). Both sessions begin at 7 p.m.</p>
      <p>• Autographs will be $1 each. That is all I can afford to pay.</p>
      <p>• Robbed-servation: Cameron Judge was robbed! Judge, not the Montreal Alouettes’ Henoc Muamba, should have been named the CFL’s most outstanding defensive player. Yes, Muamba had more defensive tackles (93, to Judge’s 61), but the latter player was more impactful. Judge had five sacks — four more than Muamba. One of Judge’s sacks forced a fumble that was returned for a touchdown. Judge added two interceptions, including a pick-six that secured first place for Saskatchewan. Muamba did not register a pick, although he did have two forced fumbles (one more than Judge).</p>
      <p>• Another robbed-servation, from 1989: The Hamilton Tiger-Cats’ Rocky DiPietro was named the CFL’s most outstanding Canadian, getting the nod over <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-legend-jeff-fairholm-belongs-in-canadian-football-hall-of-fame">Saskatchewan’s Jeff Fairholm</a>. DiPietro caught 56 passes for 884 yards and two touchdowns. Despite missing three games due to injury, Fairholm caught 45 passes for 893 yards and 11 TDs. Somehow, the voters chose DiPietro even though Fairholm had nine more yards and (get this) nine more touchdowns!</p>
      <p>• Hamilton’s Brandon Banks ran away with most-outstanding-player honours, receiving 41 first-place votes to Fajardo’s nine. Banks caught 112 passes for 1,550 yards and 13 touchdowns, in addition to scoring twice on missed field-goal returns and once on a rush. It was a superlative season, to be certain, but <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/happy-60th-joey-walters">the Roughriders’ Joey Walters</a> had a better year in 1981 and didn’t even receive the West’s MOP nomination. In 16 games — as many as Banks played during the 2019 regular season — Walters caught 91 passes for 1,715 yards and 14 TDs. He was also stopped on the one-yard line on four occasions. The Roughriders’ No. 17 had 11 100-yard games, including two streaks of five in a row. However, Winnipeg’s Dieter Brock ended up receiving MOP distinction in the West en route to being named the league’s best player for the second successive season.</p>
      <p>• In response to a tweet by Rod Pedersen, Banks opined that the Tiger-Cats’ Dane Evans was better than “y’all QB,” namely Fajardo. Fajardo’s retort: “Dane Evans is a great QB and I could not be happier for him, but there is no need to drag me into this that ain’t cool. I guess I don’t have a name too.”</p>
      <p>• The addition of <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/zach-wytinck-embraces-opportunity-to-help-out-the-rebuilding-regina-pats">20-year-old defenceman Zach Wytinck</a>, who was obtained from the Brandon Wheat Kings on Oct. 9, was an inspired move by Regina Pats general manager and vice-president of hockey operations John Paddock.</p>
      <p>• Nice people who deserve a plug: Cody Fajardo, Govind Achyuthan, Debra Duncan, Ken McCaw, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/local-sports/coach-carla-nicholls-is-savouring-her-third-olympic-games">Carla Nicholls</a>, Sandra Harazny, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/amanda-ruller-a-strong-influencer">Amanda Ruller</a>, Tom Reardon, Chris Harbron, Amber MacLeod, Heather Dufault, Cathy Sali, Nancy McCurdy, Pat Langston, Kim Wood, Lily Tenbult, Paige Tenbult, Phil Tank, Garrett Kot and Jade Belmore.</p>
