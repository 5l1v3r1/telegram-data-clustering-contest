      <p>ORLANDO, FLA. (WSVN) - White Castle is reportedly preparing to announce its return to Florida.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/news/2019/11/22/breaking-white-castle-burger-chain-returns-to.html">BizJournals</a>, the company will reveal a new location coming to the Orlando area.</p>
      <p>White Castle, known for their sliders, has not had a presence in the Sunshine State in more than half a century.</p>

      <p>Currently, White Castle has locations in 13 states, operating more than 375 restaurants in total.</p>
      <p>An official announcement is expected on Monday morning.</p>
