      <p>A 23-year-old man is due in Nanaimo provincial court Dec. 17 after being charged in a collision last December that killed retired police officer Shinder Kirk.</p>
      <p>Conrad Niklaus Wetten was charged with driving without due care and attention Nov. 15, said Nanaimo RCMP Const. Gary O’Brien.</p>
      <p>Kirk, who had served as both an Abbotsford Police Department media-relations officer and a spokesman with the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit, was driving a pickup truck west on Cedar Road on Dec. 22, 2018 when it crashed head-on with a pickup heading east.</p>
      <p>He was pronounced dead at the scene, about a kilometre from the Cedar Road bypass. Two passengers in Kirk’s vehicle were airlifted to hospital with serious but non-life-threatening injuries, while two other passengers had minor injuries.</p>
      <p>The two occupants in the other truck had minor injuries.</p>
      <p>O’Brien said at the time of the incident that investigators did not believe alcohol and speed were contributing factors.</p>
      <p>News of Kirk’s death generated tributes across B.C.</p>
