      <h2>Strictly Come Dancing judge Shirley Ballas danced around and held hands with her new younger lover</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:12:50+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:12</time> by <a rel="author">Verity Sulway, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/verity-sulway/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> judge <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/shirley-ballas">Shirley Ballas</a> appears to have a new lease of life.</p>
      <p>She moved from LA to England, had her breast implants removed after they caused health issues, and has a younger partner.</p>
      <p>Shirley, 59, has been dating actor Daniel Taylor, 47, since last year.</p>
      <p>And judging by new photos of the loved up couple turning on the Christmas lights in Darlington, they've never been happier together.</p>
      <p>Shirley and Daniel were pictured beaming, holding hands and dancing in the street and on stage together.</p>
      <p>They couldn't keep their hands off each other as they posed for photos with fans.</p>

      <p>Her happiness is all the more touching given Shirley had a rocky road to finding love.</p>
      <p>The professional dancer was married to Sammy Stopford from 1980 until 1984, and she married second husband Corky Ballas a year later, but they divorced in 2007.</p>
      <p>Shirley told Mirror Online her relationship with current beau Daniel is far more relaxed than with her ex husband.</p>

      <p>When asked what she had learnt about herself from being with Daniel, she replied: "That it’s OK to be just me. I don’t always have to be on point. I don’t feel anxious any more, as he calms me.</p>
      <p>That’s the opposite to anything I’ve had before, so it’s been quite revealing.</p>
      <p>"I don’t have to be dolled up 24/7.</p>

      <p>My ex-husband had a thing where I couldn’t get into bed if my toe polish was chipped. It’s nice that I don’t have to do that."</p>
      <p>Last month, Shirley had her DD breast implants removed after nurses told her they obscured their view during a mammogram.</p>
      <p>Shirley had a family history of breast cancer, and so decided to have them removed.</p>
