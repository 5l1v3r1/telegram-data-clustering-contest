      <p>Nicole Scherzinger shocked fans when she agreed to boot Try Star off the X Factor: Celebrity edition, after being romantically linked to one of the band’s singers Thom Evans.</p>
      <p>The band, made up of Thom, Ben Foden and Levi Davis, were voted off the show by the judges over the weekend.</p>
      <p>A source has claimed that the former Pussycat Doll wants the relationship to be taken seriously, and couldn’t stand having it potentially play out on the show.</p>
