      <p>A father of four was left brain damaged after plunging two stories onto concrete while hanging Christmas lights.</p>
      <p>Jason Blair suffered a traumatic brain injury, skull fractures, broken ribs and a punctured lung after suffering the fall in Rock Hill, South Carolina, last Thursday.</p>
      <p>He is currently on a ventilator, with a GoFundMe page set up to pay medical expenses warning that Blair’s condition had ‘regressed’ on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Blair works as an odd-job man, and was hanging the decorations for client Stephanie Haas at the time of the accident.</p>
      <p>He is now in intensive care, with doctors warning Blairs’ family that his prognosis is ‘not good.’</p>

      <p>‘If you needed anything he would help you.’</p>
      <p>Eddington explained that Blair had a tough start to life, and was later adopted by his family.</p>
      <p>He said that while doctors have warned him to prepare for the worst, he is still hopeful his sibling will pull through.</p>
      <p>Eddington said: ‘I think he’s going to make it. My brother is a strong man.’</p>

      <p>Homeowner Haas, who set up the GoFundMe <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/jason-blair039s-medical-expenses">page</a> to support Blair, explained that the handyman’s wife Doris is out of work, and that he is sole provider for his family.</p>
      <p>And the stricken worker’s friend Chris Perkins said they’d been stunned by the level of goodwill shown towards Blair, saying: ‘The outpouring of support has been absolutely overwhelming.’</p>
      <p>Doctors will perform an MRI scan to establish the full extent of Blair’s injuries if and when his condition stabilizes.</p>
