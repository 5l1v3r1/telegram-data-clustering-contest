      <h1>Uber driver 'can't wait' for next London Mayor election after firm loses licence</h1>

      <p>Frustrated Uber drivers say they ‘don’t know what more they can do’ to operate more safely after the firm lost its licence in the capital.</p>
      <p>This morning Transport for London (TFL) said they would not grant a new licence after identifying ‘several breaches’ which put customers at risk.</p>
      <p>It <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/uber-banned-london-midnight-losing-licence-battle-11213996/">found that in at least 14,000 trips,</a> drivers had uploaded photos of themselves to the app linked to cars which they were not registered to drive.</p>
      <p>This meant passengers were picked up by people who were not named or authorised by the company.</p>
      <p>But Uber drivers in the city today said TFL’s move is ‘absolutely not fair’ and accused Mayor of London Sadiq Khan of seeking to ‘protect’ black cabbies.</p>
      <p>Travelling in his Mitsubishi Outlander, Eduard, 44, told Metro.co.uk: ‘Why the hell do I have to suffer because of some idiots?</p>

      <p>‘I have a clean driving licence I have no convictions I have my own car which I paid for I have insurance.</p>

      <p>‘There are idiots everywhere, drivers and customers. I don’t know what I or the company can do more for you to feel safe.’</p>
      <p>The father-of-two said TFL has always ‘put pressure’ on Uber and says they have regularly stopped him in the street with police to check his details.</p>
      <p>He says drivers have been given more and more hoops to jump through in recent years, including being made to pay congestion charge, which black cab drivers don’t have to pay.</p>
      <p>Eduard says he is DBS checked and had to take an English language test as required for his job.</p>
      <p>Slamming TFL’s move as an attempt to ‘protect black cabs’, he said: ‘If a restaurant sets up next to Starbucks you can’t say “You can’t come here I’m already here”.’</p>

      <p>Uber initially lost its licence in 2017 due to safety concerns but was granted two extensions, the most recent of which expired on Sunday.</p>
      <p>But the firm has said it will <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/uber-vows-fight-tfl-licence-scrapped-london-11214418/">appeal the decision</a> and will be allowed to operate during this process.</p>
      <p>Eduard, who asked not to give his second name, expects the struggle between Uber and TFL to continue as long as Sadiq Khan is in charge of the city.</p>
      <p>The former criminal investigator form Moldova added: I hope he’s not going to get another term he is a rubbish Mayor. He’s done nothing about knife crime.’</p>

      <p>He says he now ‘can’t wait’ for the 2020 Mayor of London elections.</p>
      <p>Dismissing claims of unauthorised drivers taking people’s places as ‘rubbish’ and said Uber is still safer than many minicab services.</p>

      <p>Eduard says he’s restricted to working 10 hour shifts for the firm but claims many private hire firms will allow people to work 20 hour days.</p>
      <p>As he pulled away from outside the Saatchi Gallery in Chelsea, an angry black cab driver could be heard shouting: ‘You’re finished!’</p>
      <p>Insisting TFL had made the right decision, he added: ‘They had an unfair advantage, they don’t any more.’</p>
      <p>Uber driver Mohamed said TFL’s move is ‘absolutely ridiculous’ and risks putting thousands of people’s livelihoods on the line.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘The Mayor of London I think is just acting just to show that he’s caring about safety for people.</p>
      <p>‘If Uber are shut down people are going to move to another company. It’s going to be the same problem again.’</p>

      <p>The Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ‘I support the decision by TfL’s licensing officials today in relation to Uber and completely understand why the decision was taken.</p>
      <p>‘Keeping Londoners safe is my absolute number-one priority, and TfL have identified a pattern of failure by Uber that has directly put passengers’ safety at risk.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘There is undoubtedly a place for innovative companies in London – in fact we are home to some of the best in the world.</p>
      <p>‘But it is essential that companies play by the rules to keep their customers safe.</p>
      <p>‘At this stage TfL can’t be confident that Uber has the robust processes in place to prevent another serious safety breach in the future.</p>
      <p>‘I know this decision may be unpopular with Uber users but their safety is the paramount concern.</p>
      <p>‘Regulations are there to keep Londoners safe, and fully complying with TfL’s strict standards is essential if private hire operators want a licence to operate in London.’</p>

      <p>Uber’s regional manger for northern and eastern Europe Jamie Heywood said: ‘TfL’s decision not to renew Uber’s licence in London is extraordinary and wrong, and we will appeal.</p>
      <p>‘We have fundamentally changed our business over the last two years and are setting the standard on safety.</p>
      <p>‘TfL found us to be a fit and proper operator just two months ago, and we continue to go above and beyond.</p>
      <p>‘On behalf of the 3.5 million riders and 45,000 licensed drivers who depend on Uber in London, we will continue to operate as normal and will do everything we can to work with TfL to resolve this situation.’</p>
