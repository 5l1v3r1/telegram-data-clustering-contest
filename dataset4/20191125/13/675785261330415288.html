      <h1>Man Utd hero slams Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side for "disaster" at Sheffield United</h1>
      <h2>One ex-Red Devils man left no one uncertain about how he felt the first half went for his old side away to the Blades</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:09:47+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:09</time> by <a rel="author">Ned Keating</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> were far from their best in the opening 45 minutes of their 3-3 draw at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sheffield-united-fc">Sheffield United</a> in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/premier-league">Premier League</a> and one former Red Devils star has not held back in his thoughts on the first period.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ole-gunnar-solskjaer">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's</a> men trailed to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/john-fleck">John Fleck's</a> opener at the break in Bramall Lane, but were fortunate not to find themselves further behind.</p>
      <p>The English giants looked disjointed for vast periods of the first half, with the gamble to hand <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/phil-jones">Phil Jones</a> his first league start of the season backfiring.</p>
      <p>Though they conceded a second to Lys Mousset in the second half, Utd eventually rallied to lead 3-2 after goals from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brandon-williams">Brandon Williams</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mason-greenwood">Mason Greenwood</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/marcus-rashford">Marcus Rashford</a> , only for Oli McBurnie to score a stoppage-time equaliser for the Blades.</p>

      <p>The second-half comeback, though, should not paper over the cracks for Utd and former Red Devils midfielder Owen Hargreaves left no one uncertain about his views on the first half.</p>
      <p>“Good luck making sense of that. For 70 minutes they were dreadful, they really were dreadful – that was probably their worst performance of the season," the ex-England international told Premier League Productions.</p>
      <p>“The first half was a disaster, nothing short of. Sheffield United should have been up by more goals, but he [Solskjaer] made changes.</p>
      <p>“The one thing you can take from it is that the young kids stepped up, so almost kind of out with the old, in with the young guys. That’s what you’ll get from today. Because his team shape and the inclusion of Phil Jones did not work.”</p>

      <p>Hargreaves was not the only former Premier League star to weigh in on Utd's showing, with ex-Arsenal man Martin Keown stating Jones appeared problematic in a back three.</p>
      <p>Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness also questioned whether the Red Devils had the right mentality for the game, believing them to not be up for the fight at Bramall Lane.</p>
