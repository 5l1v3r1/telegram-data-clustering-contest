      <p>Bandai Namco has announced that One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 will be coming to the PC on March 27th, 2020. In order to celebrate this announcement, the publisher has also released a new trailer that you can find below.</p>
      <p>One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 will combine the characters from the One Piece series with the furious action of the Dynasty Warriors franchise. Therefore, you can expect to be fighting numerous enemies on screen (in a typical Dynasty Warrior way).</p>
      <p>As the publisher noted, the game will feature an original ending as the manga is still running.</p>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>
