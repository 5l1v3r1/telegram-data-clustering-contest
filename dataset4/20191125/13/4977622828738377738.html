      <p>A kiln owner in the State of Uttar Pradesh (UP)'s Rasulabad has been reported to be building 51,000 bricks with the name of Lord Ram, all of which will be donated for the construction of a grand temple in Ayodhya, <a href="https://www.aninews.in/news/national/general-news/ayodhya-kiln-owner-to-donate-51k-bricks-for-ram-temple-construction20191125071351/">reports </a><i>Asian News International (ANI).</i></p>
      <p>Having set a target of late December to early January to complete the making of bricks, the work on them is presently reported to be going on in full swing. As per the kiln's manager Babu Ram Yadav, as many as 106 workers are working in the kiln without any footgear to ensure the purity of the bricks being manufactured.</p>
      <p>It should also be noted that the kiln owner Sandeep Verma has ensured that each brick is made from Daomath soil. Once manufactured, each brick is expected to weigh around three kilograms.</p>
      <p>The kiln began to work in this regard soon after the Supreme Court of India's all-powerful five-judge bench recently pronounced its verdict in the prolonged Ram Janmabhoomi - Babri Masjid land title suit, clearing the way for the building of a grand temple of Lord Ram at the site.</p>
