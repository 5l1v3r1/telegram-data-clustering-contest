      <p>First up, director Marielle Heller provides some insight into a scene from A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, the movie about Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood host Fred Rogers. This particular scene (via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNeocV-iCfo&amp;feature=emb_title"><i>New York Times</i></a>) was shot in the same studio where the original television show as shot in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Heller explains they used the same style and brand of broadcast cameras the original show used to present it on video monitors within the scene, lending a layer of authenticity.</p>

      <p>Finally, before Will Ferrell hosted <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, he took the time to give a tour of Studio 8H, where the show unfolds in front of a live audience. The only problem is Will Ferrell doesn’t seem to know as much as he thinks he does about the legendary television studio.</p>
