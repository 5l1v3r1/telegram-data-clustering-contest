      <p>When voters head to the polls in Brecon &amp; Radnorshire on December 12, it will be the second time in five months they have been asked to elect an MP.</p>
      <p>The first time was in August, when a by-election took place in the constituency.</p>
      <p>This was won by the Liberal Democrats, who took the seat from the Conservatives on a massive 12% swing.</p>
      <p>Now the Tories have a chance for revenge – and they would need a much smaller swing of just over 2% to take the seat back.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson visited Brecon &amp; Radnorshire on Monday on the campaign trail.</p>
      <p>It is one of a handful of constituencies in Wales that could change hands at the election – and the only Welsh seat being defended by Lib Dems.</p>

      <p>Jane Dodds won the seat for the Lib Dems in the by-election and is standing again this time, defending a majority of just 1,425.</p>
      <p>Her party represented Brecon &amp; Radnorshire continuously from 1997 to 2015, before losing to the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>Ms Dodds’ chances of holding the seat may have been boosted by the decision by Plaid Cymru and the Greens not to field candidates.</p>
      <p>The same pact was in operation at the by-election.</p>
      <p>Instead she is up against the Conservatives, Labour, the Christian Party and the Monster Raving Loony Party.</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party, which won 10% of the vote at the by-election, is not standing this time.</p>
      <p>If the Lib Dems win Brecon &amp; Radnorshire comfortably, they’ll be having a good night in Wales – and may even be in with a chance of taking the neighbouring Tory-held seat of Montgomeryshire.</p>
