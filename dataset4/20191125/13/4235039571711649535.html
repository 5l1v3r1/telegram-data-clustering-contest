      <p>China's <b>Volvo</b> Cars has announced that it will complete the refurbishment of more than 50,000 diesel vehicles in the coming months to reduce the <b>risk</b> of <b>fire</b> in the engine, DPA reported.</p>
      <p>In July, the company announced that some of the components in the engine were at <b>risk</b> of melting, which in the worst case scenario could cause it to ignite. The solution is to install new software and a new cooling system. Consumers have been notified of the necessary upgrades since October, company spokesman told DPA.</p>
      <p>According to him, the upgrade covers 54,000 cars in Germany and 86,000 in Sweden. Models with four-cylinder diesel motors manufactured between 2014 and 2019 have been affected.</p>
      <p>The Stockholm daily Dagens Nyheter reported that German carmaker <b>BMW</b> will be upgrading about 12,900 <b>diesel cars</b> sold in Sweden for similar reasons.</p>
      <p>The German concern said on Thursday that it would retrofit 232,000 diesel vehicles, including 113,000 in Germany, because of a potential <b>fire</b> risk.</p>
      <p>In 2010, China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group bought <b>Volvo</b> Cars from Ford.</p>
