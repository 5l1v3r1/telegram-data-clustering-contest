      <h1>Michael O'Neill jokes he will make James McClean do extra training ahead of potential Euro 2020 play-off</h1>
      <h2>The Republic of Ireland could meet Northern Ireland in the March play-off final</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:38:48+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/robert-hynes/" target="_blank">Robert Hynes</a></address>
      <p>Michael O'Neill has joked that he will make James McClean do double training sessions ahead of a potential Euro 2020 play-off final between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>The sides will meet in the March decider if the Republic beat Slovakia and the North get past Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/james-mcclean">McClean</a> put in a brilliant performance for O'Neill's Stoke City side in their 2-1 win against Wigan over the weekend and was named the man-of-the-match.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the game, O'Neill laughed: "We will probably get him doing double sessions all week or 20 kilometres a day.</p>
      <p>"To be fair to James, he does that anyway."</p>
      <p>O'Neill praised McClean for his performance against his former employers on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He added: “He’s a good player. For me he’s a good Championship player, he’s been a Premier League as well, he’s played in big clubs so he knows what expectation is and against Wigan I thought he was really positive in everything he did.</p>
      <p>“There were some great crosses into the box and I believe I can make James better. There are little refinements in his game that we can make.”</p>
