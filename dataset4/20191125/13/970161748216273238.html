      <h1>Boris Johnson's manifesto may look to the future but it's hardly revolutionary</h1>
      <address>

      <p>It’s the end of November. We’re gearing up for the festivities. Planning exactly which way we’ll overindulge. Which vices we might allow ourselves to pursue.</p>
      <p>The moment, though, is fleeting. Once you’ve run out of Alka Seltzer, energy and money, it’ll be January. You’ll be looking at your life and taking some hard decisions. How can you improve, be better? Can you picture how you’ll be by Christmas time next year?</p>
      <p>Well, it looks like <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> is way ahead of you on this. He is skipping the whole festive thing (and with a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> vote planned before 25 December, he really doesn’t seem to be into the winding down vibe).</p>
      <p>He’s gone straight to 3 January 2020. He didn’t collect £200.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>His attention isn’t just on what country we want by next Christmas, either. No, his eyes are set firmly on the horizon. He wants ‘<a href="https://metro.co.uk/video/conservative-party-manifesto-2055686/">you to imagine what the country could be like in just 10 years</a>’.</p>
      <p>Now, I’m sure that you, like me, immediately leap to the visions of sci-fi from our childhoods. Flying cars. Meals in pill form. A world without Piers Morgan. That kind of thing.</p>
      <p>To be fair, Mr Johnson did give us some of that action. Cars may be more electric than flying, but we’ve got actual space ports in Cornwall and Scotland.</p>
      <p>Stuff about artificial intelligence and vague talk of scientists that conjures up visions of lab coats and test tubes. These things are all very futuristic and aspirational.</p>
      <p>But don’t forget that conservatism has, at its heart, the idea of conserving. Conservatives look around at our country and see a great nation. The things that have got us here must be maintained.</p>
      <p>Our history, our sense of tradition, our strong family values, our law and order, our community spirit. These are what has kept our nation together and made us fabulous. We must never do anything to threaten them.</p>

      <p>According to Johnson <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/jeremy-corbyn-says-monarchy-needs-bit-improvement-11184735/">‘the institution of the monarchy is beyond reproach’</a>. Of course that’s what he thinks! It represents history and tradition and family and just about everything that conservatives believe in.</p>

      <p>Conservatism is about fixing the things that need fixing but conserving those things that should be conserved. ‘To protect and improve’.</p>
      <p>Johnson said at the launch that he wanted to ‘make this country the greatest place’.</p>
      <p>How’s he going to do that? What changes are coming in 10 years’ time? We’re going to be doing the same as we have been doing. Playing to our strengths.</p>
      <p>Those space ports? They’re to send British made satellites into the heavens. When did we first send a ‘British made satellite’ launched from a British rocket into space? 1971. That’s when. Nearly half a century ago.</p>
      <p>We’re an advanced country who have been doing advanced things for a long time. We were the sixth nation on earth to send a satellite into space from our own rockets, when we launched Prospero, also known as X-3.</p>
      <p>Other British satellites (launched by NASA) were called ‘Ariel’. They were named after a character from The Tempest by William Shakespeare. Is there anything more British (and possibly more conservative) than that?</p>
      <p>To plan seems to be about reclaiming past successes to build ‘one of our most exciting industries’. Conserving the past to build the future. To ‘protect and improve’.</p>
      <p>So when Boris looks into the future, we shouldn’t be expecting revolutionary change or a whole new Britain.</p>

      <p>In that regard, his manifesto is just like your end of year visions for the future. You want to look after yourself, tone up, find that special person, pursue the new career, travel somewhere exciting, see a therapist, quit social media, read Booker Prize winning books etc etc etc. Self-care is a beautiful thing.</p>
      <p>But you want to stay yourself. You don’t want to lose your identity. Pretending to be someone and something you’re not does not make sense.</p>
      <p>Which is why, on reading the Conservative manifesto, you may feel as if very little has changed. Boris and his party are just trying to stay true to who they are.</p>
