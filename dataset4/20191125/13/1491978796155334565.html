        <li>UKA board decides Zara Hyde Peters’ position is untenable</li>
        <li>Move comes after concerns raised over safeguarding issue</li>
      </ul>
      <p>UK <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/athletics">Athletics</a> lurched into a fresh crisis on Monday after its chief executive, Zara Hyde Peters, lost her job before she had even begun. The move follows claims she failed to tell her local athletics club about her husband’s “inappropriate relationship” with a 15-year-old schoolgirl.</p>
      <p>Hyde Peters was to start her £200,000 role next week but her position was deemed untenable by UKA after it was reported her spouse, Mike Peters, had been barred by the Department of Education in 2012 but was allowed to coach girls as young as 16 at Coventry Godiva Harriers without a UKA licence.</p>
      <p>At the time Hyde Peters was a coaching coordinator and then vice-chair at the club but reportedly did not alert it to the potential safeguarding problems.</p>
      <p>UKA has now lost its chief executive, performance director and chair – and failed to hit its medal target at the recent world championships – in the space of 10 months.</p>
      <p>In January, its former chair <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/16/uk-athletics-turmoil-richard-bowker-steps-down-chairman">Richard Bowker’s undistinguished reign ended</a> when he stepped down while facing a vote of no confidence. In October <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/08/neil-black-stand-down-uk-athletics-alberto-salazar-mo-farah">UKA’s performance director, Neil Black, </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/08/neil-black-stand-down-uk-athletics-alberto-salazar-mo-farah">left</a> after the world championships.</p>
      <p>One insider said Hyde Peters’s departure confirmed athletics as “the most dysfunctional Olympic sport in Britain”.</p>
      <p>The organisation has also been on the back foot over lingering questions regarding its closeness to the Nike Oregon Project following <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/01/athletics-coach-alberto-salazar-receives-four-year-ban-for-doping-violations">Alberto Salazar’s four-year ban </a>for anti-doping offences in October – yet its terms of reference for a planned review into its relationship with Salazar are still to be announced. Salazar’s appeal against the ban is not expected to be heard until March.</p>
      <p>To make matters worse, it was revealed this month that UKA’s widely pilloried decision to stage last year’s World Cup in London on the same weekend as the Wimbledon finals and football World Cup had cost it close to £2m.</p>
      <p>UK Sport, which has provided UKA with £27m in funding since the Rio Olympics, said it would be seeking urgent talks with UKA’s new chair, Chris Clark. “We acknowledge the announcement from UK Athletics regarding Zara Hyde Peters,” a UK Sport spokesman said. “Maintaining the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct is crucial to the integrity of sport.</p>
      <p>“We will be seeking a face-to-face meeting with UK Athletics at the earliest opportunity to discuss next steps.”</p>
      <p>When the claims regarding the safeguarding problem were first reported in the Times on Friday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/22/uk-athletics-zara-hyde-peters-chief-executive">Hyde Peters was “fully supported” by Clark in a statement</a>. However, his was a lone voice with UK Sport warning the accusations were extremely serious and the Commonwealth Games Federation calling for her to be temporarily removed from the board of Birmingham 2022.</p>
      <p>As the pressure grew, UKA called an emergency meeting on Sunday, after which Hyde Peters agreed to step down apparently before she was pushed.</p>
      <p>Clark said in a statement: “Following the meeting I had time with Zara to review the situation and we have agreed together that she will now not be taking up her position as CEO on 1st December.”</p>
      <p>It is understood a UKA review into Hyde Peters’s actions, which was announced on Friday, will continue.</p>
      <p>UKA will begin its search for a chief executive from scratch, with Jack Buckner, the chief executive of British Swimming, understood to be in the frame.</p>
      <p>Questions have also been raised about the judgment of Clark, who is seen by some in the sport as having been too quick to defend Hyde Peters when the reports first emerged.</p>
      <p>However, Clark was backed by Toni Minichiello, the coach of the Olympic champion Jessica Ennis-Hill and a member of UKA’s members’ council, who said Clark should be given time to turn the sport round after his appointment in September.</p>
      <p>“The decision that UKA has come to is strong, positive and ultimately correct,” he said. “The question now is how does athletics move forward?</p>
      <p>“Many of the problems that have come to light since Chris took up the post on the 1 September date back a number of years.</p>
      <p>“Although they are not of the new chairman’s making, I believe he is the right man with an objective eye and vision to deliver the necessary reforms.”</p>
