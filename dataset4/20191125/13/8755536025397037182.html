      <p>Kim Kardashian has revealed that she empathizes with Meghan Markle.</p>
      <p>The reality star said that she understands the Duchess of Sussex’s push to have more privacy from the glare of the royal spotlight.</p>
      <p>However, Kim told Aussie show The Sunday Project that “no one” could fully understand the pressures of being a royal.</p>

      <p>Kim said: “I think everyone has their own journey.”</p>
      <p>“I think their journey is extremely personal, with what [Harry’s] mother experienced and how her life was so affected by the spotlight and by paparazzi.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t think anyone can really understand what that’s like except for them.”</p>

      <p>However, Kim added that having children changes a public figure’s attitude to paparazzi and privacy entirely.</p>
      <p>“But I think as I’m older and as I have kids, and what I would want for them is just the safest place.”</p>
      <p>“I can definitely empathize with their need for having a secure, safe place and taking time for themselves and having privacy when they need it.”</p>
      <p>Meghan has come under scrutiny following a recent documentary she filmed with husband Prince Harry, in which she admitted to struggling in the royal spotlight.</p>
