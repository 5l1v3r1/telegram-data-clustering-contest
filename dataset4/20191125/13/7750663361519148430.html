      <p>Despite being just 18 years of age, the centre-back has already made 32 starts in Ligue 1, with a further six coming in cup competitions.</p>

      <p>However, according to <i>Scouts in Attendance</i>, Newcastle had a representative present at Monaco's fixture with Bordeaux on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The France Under-19 international has just over 18 months remaining on his contract, putting Monaco in a position where they may have to consider any bids for his signature.</p>
