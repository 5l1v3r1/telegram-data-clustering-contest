      <h1>TSB branches in Tayside and Fife at risk of closure</h1>
      <h2>TSB branches across Tayside and Fife are at risk of closure, as the bank today announced plans to close 82 outlets next year.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:33:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/robmclaren/" target="_blank">Rob McLaren</a></address>
      <p>Up to 400 jobs could be at risk in the cost-cutting move.</p>
      <p>TSB has more than 20 bank branches across Tayside and Fife.</p>
      <p>The bank said it was cutting back its locations to refocus on profits, and will replace workers’ tasks with automated processes.</p>
      <p>TSB operates four branches in Dundee as well as Broughty Ferry’s Brook Street.</p>
      <p>It has five branches in Angus – in Arbroath, Carnousite, Montrose, Forfar and Brechin.</p>
      <p>The bank operates from Perth, Coupar Angus, Kinross, Blairgowrie and Crieff.</p>
      <p>TSB also has sites in Rosyth, Dunfermline, Cowdenbeath, Cupar, Burntisland, Glenrothes, Buckhaven, Leven, St Andrews, Anstruther and two sites in Kirkcaldy.</p>
      <p>Staff will be told if their bank is affected in the coming days, and a full list of sites slated for closure will be published on Thursday.</p>
      <p>TSB said it will try to find new roles for them elsewhere in the group.</p>
      <p>It is part of a plan to save around £100 million by 2022, and turn a profit of between £130m and £140m.</p>
      <p>“The plan we’re sharing today involves some difficult decisions, but it sets TSB up to succeed in the future,” said TSB boss Debbie Crosbie, as she set out the three-year plan.</p>
      <p>“Taken together, these changes will help us to serve more customers, better, for the long-term.”</p>
      <p>It also includes a push to invest another £120m in digital products.</p>
      <p>The bank said it expects 70% to 80% of its sales to come from digital channels by 2022, up from 46% in September this year.</p>
      <p>It comes in a tough retail environment for British banks, with high streets suffering while online-only challengers are tempting customers with new types of accounts.</p>
      <p>TSB said it had around twice the number of stores per 10,000 customers in 2018 as the average in the UK.</p>
      <p>“With a trusted brand, modern platform, and national presence, TSB is well placed to deliver – but we need to make changes to enable us to compete,” Ms Crosbie said.</p>
      <p>“Our new strategy positions TSB to succeed in a challenging external environment at a time when we know customers want something different and better from their bank.”</p>
      <p>Conservative North East MSP Bill Bowman, who met TSB bosses in the past over the firm’s cutbacks, said the news was “extremely worrying”.</p>
      <p>He said: “I had a visit from TSB at the Scottish Parliament, which included their head of public affairs, and at that time they assured me they wanted to keep branches open as part of offering something different from their rivals – this is clearly now not on their agenda and I’m very disappointed.</p>
      <p>“More local closures would be a betrayal of their customers, staff and communities.</p>
      <p>“I sought answers from the company earlier this year when it cut the opening hours of its only branch in Carnoustie and I feared this would have a devastating impact on the area.</p>
      <p>“I will write to TSB expressing my concerns and will try to find out the consequences this announcement will have on branches in the region as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>“Not only has the company said it will close 82 branches nationwide, it has also said it will look to restructure ones that are kept open which is also very concerning.</p>
      <p>“Technology is changing the way people use their banks but companies can’t leave others who don’t use online banking behind.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t matter where you live – whether it’s Forfar, Montrose or Dundee – residents still rely on high street banks for help, advice or simply cashing money in or out.</p>
      <p>“We have already seen a number of other banks in Angus and Dundee shut in recent times and the devastating impact it can have on our communities.</p>
      <p>“My sympathy and support goes towards staff at all of the TSB branches who have been left in the dark over this, not knowing if they will still be in a job next year – it’s shocking.”</p>
