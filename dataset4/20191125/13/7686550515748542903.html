      <p>Jacqueline Jossa's husband Dan Osborne is urging I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! viewers to stop voting for his wife to do Bushtucker Trials on the ITV game show.</p>
      <p>Posting a video on his Instagram, the 28-year-old spoke about Jacqueline - who he shares two daughters with - and begged fans to "give her a break" following her on-air meltdown last night.</p>
      <p>During Sunday's episode Jacqueline was voted in by viewers - alongside Ian Wright - to enter the 'Crevice of Cruelty'. She became very upset and confessed to her campmates: "‘I don’t want to do this any more’.</p>
      <p>Sad about seeing his wife so distraught, Dan took to Instagram to urge followers to stop voting Jacqueline in to do any more Bushtucker Trials.</p>

      <p>He said: "Give her a break please because she's getting upset now.</p>
      <p>"I know I said you all vote for Jac cos she's ain't in there to change lightbulbs, but I didn't mean every single trial. Give her a break now, come on."</p>
      <p>On a more positive note, he added: "But she keeps smashing them all. She's worried about it but she'll smash it. She'll keep proving everyone."</p>

      <p>His video was revealed during today's episode of This Morning as ex-campmates Georgia Toffolo and Stanley Johnson discussed Jacqueline's performance with hosts, Phil and Holly.</p>
      <p>Appearing on the daytime TV show, Stanley brought up Jacqueline's tendency to get upset when being put forward to do a trial, and pondered whether it is all is a bit of an act.</p>
      <p>Turning to his co-host, Georgia 'Toff' Toffolo, he said: "I wonder if she puts this on a bit", to which Holly replied "I think she's just stronger than she thinks she is".</p>

      <p>It seems it isn't just Dan who thinks viewers should focus on sending other people in to do Bushtucker trials, many people have taken to Twitter to also have their say.</p>
      <p>One posted: "Honestly who keeps voting for Jacqueline, she’s already proved herself bless her #ImACeleb"</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "PLEASE STOP VOTING FOR JACQUELINE I HATE SEEING HER UPSET #ImACeleb."</p>
      <p>However, some people have been calling the soap star out for potentially "putting on an act" and "crying too much".</p>
      <p>One viewer tweeted: "Jacqueline cries for the 56th time before she starts the trial.. #imaceleb"</p>
      <p>A second said: "If Jacqueline stopped crying, acting so childish, people probably wouldn’t vote for her as much. I like her but oh man, she’s frustrating #ImACeleb"</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a third wrote: "Confused as to why people think Jacqueline is “acting?”. You can tell she is genuinely terrified, absolutely no acting involved. She overthinks it and then gets on with it and smashes it and you can see she’s genuinely proud of herself after. #ImACeleb"</p>
