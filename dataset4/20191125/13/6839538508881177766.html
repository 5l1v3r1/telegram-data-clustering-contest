      <p>It is regarded as one of the oldest, and most secure, museums in the world. Yet in the early hours, brazen thieves managed to steal treasure whose value is estimated in the billions.</p>
      <p>The Gruenes Gewoelbe (Green Vault) in Dresden, Germany, was targeted by crooks who broke into the building in the early hours of the morning.</p>
      <p>The theft would be comfortably the largest in history, surpassing the $A750 million raid on the Gardner Museum in Boston nearly 30 years ago, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10417712/billion-euros-worth-of-jewellery-and-diamonds-stolen-in-raid-on-german-museum-as-secure-as-fort-knox/"><i>The Sun</i></a> reports.</p>

      <p>The thieves cut off a power supply in the early hours before breaking through a window into the museum which once boasted it was “as secure as Fort Knox”.</p>
      <p>Thieves made off with jewellery and diamonds which may have been worth up to £850 million ($A1.6bn),<i> Bild</i> reports.</p>
      <p>Police are yet to confirm exactly what was taken. AP reports the thieves made off with three “priceless” sets of jewellery from the 18th century that German officials said would be impossible to sell on the open market.</p>

      <p>The robbers made their getaway in a saloon car and remain on the run but it is hoped that CCTV may have captured them on video despite the electrical outage.</p>
      <p>A fire broke out on a nearby bridge overnight and it is believed that the blaze may be connected to the attack on the power supply.</p>
      <p>Local reports in Germany say the thieves were “noticeably small” and able to fit through a tiny window.</p>
      <p>Saxony police said in a statement this morning that “unknown” thieves had broken inside the museum but said further details were not yet available.</p>

      <p>Regional premier Michael Kretschmer said: “Not only our state collections but we the people of Saxony have been robbed.</p>
      <p>“You cannot understand the history of our state without the Green Vault and the state collections of Saxony.”</p>
      <p>Two thieves disguised as police officers stole 13 works of art from the Boston museum in March 1990 and the crime remains unsolved.</p>

      <p>In 2010, then-museum director Martin Roth boasted in an interview with <i>Die Welt</i> that the Green Vault was “as secure as Fort Knox”.</p>
      <p>The collection dates back to 1723, while the Dresden royal palace which houses it was first built in 1533.</p>
      <p>The Green Vault gets its name from the green-coloured columns and decoration in some of the rooms.</p>

      <p>This latest heist calls to mind the notorious Pink Panther gang who are behind several of Europe’s most daring heists.</p>
      <p>Hailing from Eastern Europe, the network of criminals has stolen more than $A500 million during highly-planned jobs for more than 30 years.</p>
      <p>The crime syndicate is made up of around 200 criminals who made their name hiding a giant diamond in a pot of skin cream during an audacious 2003 raid in London.</p>
      <p>Made up mostly of Serbians and Montenegrins, the gang has struck all around the world – including cities such as Cannes, Singapore, Dubai and Tokyo.</p>
