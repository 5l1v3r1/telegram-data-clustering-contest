      <p>Phillip Schofield has weighed in on the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> Bushtucker trial that caused drama on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>In order to win roast dinners for camp, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-haskell/">James Haskell</a> and Roman Kemp had to lie on a bed filled with snakes and try to unscrew stars from one side of the bed and screw them onto the other side.</p>
      <p>Each star was in a box filled with critters and animals, including a crab that put a spanner in the works and meant they were unable to complete the trial in the 90-second time.</p>

      <p>Viewers who tuned in were <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/im-celebrity-fans-demand-justice-james-haskell-roman-kemp-impossible-bushtucker-trial-11212111/">convinced the trial was ‘impossible’ to do in 90 seconds</a>, but hosts Ant and Dec tweeted that it was successfully completed within the time during the dry run.</p>
      <p>James and Roman’s failure meant that three celebs – Ian Wright, Cliff Parisi and Andy Whyment – would miss out on the delicious dinner.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Monday’s This Morning, Phillip felt that the show had stirred things up to create drama for the celebs.</p>
      <p>He told ex camp mates Georgia ‘Toff’ Toffolo and Stanley Johnson: ‘The last [trial], it’s not possible in 90 seconds.’</p>

      <p>‘If they’d gone the other end with the spiders first they would have got it easy,’ Holly said.</p>
      <p>Phil went on: ‘The thing is if they’d all done it as well – because they don’t seem to be squeamish all of them – if they’d done that really quickly everyone would have been fed, and where’s the fun in that?</p>
      <p>‘So now we have three people at the bottom of that who don’t get their roast dinner.’</p>

      <p>Holly added: ‘Including Ian who’s a right grumpy grump at the moment, isn’t he?’</p>
      <p>We don’t think Ian, Cliff or Andy are going to be happy bunnies when they return to camp.</p>
      <p>The Love Island-themed trial also saw some celebs have to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/im-celebrity-james-haskell-roman-kemp-pass-ball-using-mouths-grim-love-island-style-trial-11213774/">pass pig testicles between them</a> using their mouths, while other gulped down disgusting milkshakes made of blended cockroaches or vomit fruit.</p>
