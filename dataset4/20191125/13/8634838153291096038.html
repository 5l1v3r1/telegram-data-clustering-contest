      <h1>Ruto Lands in Kapenguria Hours After Matiang'i Backed Out</h1>

        <b>Deputy President William Ruto arrived safely at the Kapenguria Level 5 hospital, West Pokot County on Monday, November 25, despite bad weather reports that prevented a section of state officials from accessing the area.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ruto's presence in the region aroused questions of how he managed to access the hospital yet Interior CS Fred Matiang'i had earlier indicated that the area was inaccessible due to bad weather.</p>
      <p>"State officers, including CS Eugene Wamalwa, IG Hillary Mutyambai, Rift Valley RC George Natembeya and I have been compelled to land at Eldoret Int'l Airport on our way to West Pokot due to inclement weather. We hope to make there soon to appraise recovery andÂ response operations and make possible adjustments," Matiang'i stated.</p>

      <p>Operations to relocate and cater to the affected families were ongoing aided by the county government, the national government and the Kenya Red Cross.</p>
