      <h1>Cork City Council issues 'tidal flood warning' as Storm Sebastian heads for Ireland</h1>
      <h2>Heavy rain and gale force winds are expected at times tomorrow which could bring a risk of flooding</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:16:04+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/sam-roberts/" target="_blank">Sam Roberts</a></address>
      <p>Cork City Council have issued a tidal flood warning as the remnants of Storm Sebastian head for Ireland.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/met-eireann">Met Eireann</a> has warned that heavy rain and gale force winds are expected at times tomorrow which could bring a risk of flooding in some parts of the country.</p>
      <p>And the Rebel county will be hit particularly hard as the tail end of the former Tropical Storm Sebastien arrives on Irish shores.</p>
      <p>A Cork City Council spokesman said: "Cork City Council wish to advise that there will be a period of very high astronomical Spring Tides from Tuesday 26th November until Wednesday 27th November.</p>

      <p>"A tidal surge and periodic strong southerly/south-easterly winds are also predicted over the next few days. These factors combined will result in tide levels higher than the natural tide levels.</p>
      <p>"From Tuesday morning until Wednesday evening, prior to and after these tides, there is a significant risk of tidal flooding in the City. </p>
      <p>"Householders and Businesses should take Precautionary Measures to protect property."</p>
      <p>Cork City Council have also highlighted particular low-lying areas that will be worst hit by the unsettled weather.</p>
      <p>A spokesman added: "It is likely that flooding will occur in the low lying areas of the City Centre in particular on Morrison’s Quay, Fr. Mathew Quay, Fr. Mathew Street, Union Quay, Trinity Bridge, South Terrace, Lavitts Quay, Kyrls Street, Kyrls Quay, Crosses Green, Sharman Crawford St and Wandesford Quay.</p>

      <p>"The situation will continue to be monitored and further advice will be issued."</p>
      <p>The council advised that a limited stock of gel-bags and sand-bags will be available for collection between 12pm and 6pm today, and 8am and 6pm tomorrow.</p>
      <p>They added that road closures and traffic restrictions are also likely to be put in place.</p>
