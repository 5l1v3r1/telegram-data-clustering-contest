      <p>Israel's exports, a key economic growth driver, are expected to grow to a record US$114 billion in 2019 from US$109 billion last year, government data showed on Sunday.</p>
      <p>According to the Central Bureau and Statistics and Economy Ministry, Israeli goods and services exports stood at US$84 billion over the first nine months of the year, up 4.6 percent from January-September 2018.</p>
      <p>The Economy Ministry said the increase this year stems mostly from a nearly 12 percent rise in services exports, with growth led by the high tech sector such as software, computing and research and development services.</p>
      <p>The gain in services has more than offset weakness in goods exports, which have been hurt this year by slowing global trade, a weak diamond market, and a strong shekel currency.</p>
      <p>Exports comprise around 30 percent of Israel's economic activity.</p>
      <p>Overall, exports to the European Union -- Israel's largest trading partner -- rose 4.8 percent this year, led by the UK, Spain, Poland and Belgium. Exports to the United States -- the largest export market by country -- rose 2 percent while exports to India grew 9 percent. Exports to Asian markets including China and Japan fell this year.</p>
