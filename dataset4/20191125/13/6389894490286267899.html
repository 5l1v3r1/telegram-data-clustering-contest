      <p>Asos has appointed its first chief growth officer to strengthen its senior management team as it recovers from a drop in profit following a botched international expansion. </p>
      <p>The online retailer said Robert Birge, who was previously chief marketing officer at travel search site Kayak and media agency IMG, will join the company on 3 December.</p>

      <p>Asos pledged to strengthen its executive team when it announced plunging profit in its full-year results in October. </p>
      <p>The drop followed major problems at its new warehouses in Berlin and Atlanta as the retailer targeted international expansion. </p>
      <p>The e-commerce giant is currently in the process of recruiting three other new executives to oversee its product, HR and strategy divisions. </p>
      <p>Asos chief executive Nick Beighton said: “Robert’s proven track record in delivering high impact marketing programmes for fast-growing e-commerce businesses means he is an ideal appointment for this new role.</p>
      <p>“And, with more than half of our revenue coming from international markets, his global experience will help fuel our ability to take advantage of the growth opportunities ahead of us.” </p>

      <p>Birge added: “I am incredibly excited to be joining Asos. Its world-class brand and recent infrastructure investments mean it is well placed to accelerate its global growth plans, and I can’t wait to join the team and play my part.”</p>
