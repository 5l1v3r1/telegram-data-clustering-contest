      <p><b><a href="https://www.itv.com/news/topic/david-gauke/">David Gauke</a></b> has taken an unconventional approach to election campaign videos and decided to inject some humour into proceedings ahead of December 12.</p>
      <p>Instead of sticking to a standard format, listing his party's pledges and persuading voters to choose him, the Independent candidate for South West Hertfordshire recruited someone closer to home.</p>
      <p>The video begins with the former Tory minister explaining that long-standing Conservative supporters who are "unhappy with the direction" of the party are looking to vote elsewhere.</p>
      <p>At that point he introduces Jim, a “dismayed longstanding Conservative” who Mr Gauke says is now backing him.</p>

      <p>Jim explains he has voted Conservative for the last 50 years and has always been a "middle of the road, One Nation and liberal-minded" Tory.</p>
      <p>But he decided to switch political allegiance and is now backing the former Conservative minister.</p>
      <p>Jim adds that if he were living in Mr Gauke’s constituency, he would “certainly” vote for him.</p>
      <p>But all is not as it seems, because at this point in the video, Mr Gauke reveals the twist in the video, as he replies: “Thanks Dad,” revealing Jim to be his father and Jim adds: "You are welcome son."</p>
      <p>The video has been welcomed on social media, with users praising the politician for "the best GE video so far" and for "raising a smile".</p>
      <p>So far, the video has had more than 355,000 views and almost 1,000 retweets.</p>
      <p>But Mr Gauke is not the only one to get creative with his General Election campaign video.</p>
      <p>Sorry, this content isn't available on your device.</p>
      <p>Labour candidate Dr Rosena Allin-Khan took inspiration from the Christmas movie Love Actually for her video.</p>
      <p>She recreates the now iconic scene when Andrew Lincoln's character declares his love for Juliet, played by Keira Knightley.</p>
      <p>But in the Dr Alli-Khan version, she declares, "with any luck, next year I'll be your MP."</p>
      <p>And lists Labour's manifesto pledges, including the party's commitment to the NHS, education and policing, eventually persuading the voter to switch from being a Tory supporter to backing her.</p>

      <p>While Tory candidate George Freeman's video went viral after BBC News producer Callum May retweeted it with the caption 'Worst. Burlesque. Ever.' in reference to the two rosettes, unfortunately placed.</p>
      <p>Sorry, this content isn't available on your device.</p>
      <p>And Health Secretary Matt Hancock was teased for his election campaign video, in which his head was perfectly aligned with a tree in the background, making it appear as if he had the hair of Art Garfunkel.</p>
      <p>Many took to social media to point out the unfortunate angle, with one user writing "Tonight Matthew, I am Art Garfunkel" and another said "Matt Hancock appears to be sporting a brave new haircut."</p>
