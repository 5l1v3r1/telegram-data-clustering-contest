        <b>This is the moment that Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) is left moritifed in front of the other <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mums/">mums</a> after she is breathalysed and then arrested for drink driving in EastEnders. The stressed out landlady has been hitting the booze more and more and it is becoming a crutch, something which husband Mick (Danny Dyer) remains unaware of currently.</b>
      </p>
      <p>She has been desperate to fit in with the other judgemental mums at Ollie’s school while also trying to get her head around Ollie’s autism diagnosis. And when she bumps into a car at Ollie’s school and then makes off, hoping that no-one has seen, she is in hot water.</p>
      <p>She is soon confronted by the police and she is gutted when she fails a breathalyser test before being bundled into a police car. Ashamed, she determines to keep the truth from Mick about what has happened – but how long until he discovers the truth?</p>

      <p>Linda’s battle with drink will become more and more damaging as the months go on, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/04/eastenders-spoilers-major-alcoholism-storyline-revealed-for-linda-carter-10686054/">with show boss Jon Sen recently announcing a long running alcoholism story for the character.</a></p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>He said: ‘This autumn the Carters will face one of their biggest crises to date when Linda turns to alcohol to escape the increasing pressures of her family life. Linda’s descent into alcoholism will be instantly recognisable to many – a journey that begins with a single drink to cope with the everyday ups and downs but quickly escalates to a point which wreaks devastation on their life and the lives of those around them.</p>

      <p>‘In telling Linda’s story we hope that anyone in Linda’s situation or those around them notice the signs of alcoholism and seek the help needed.’</p>
      <p>In order to depict Linda’s struggle as accurately and effectively as possible, the BBC has partnered up with awareness charity DrinkAware to help shape the storyline.</p>

      <p>Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware Chief Executive, said of their involvement with the plot: ‘Working with EastEnders on this storyline will help us put a spotlight on the potentially harmful result of getting into the habit of drinking regularly.</p>
      <p>‘Credit to the script writers who are sensitively showing the journey of how easy it can be for someone to develop risky drinking habits.</p>

      <p>‘Linda’s experiences with alcohol demonstrate why it’s important to be able to recognise signs that you, or someone you care about, could be developing drinking habits that could cause harm to themselves or others.’</p>
