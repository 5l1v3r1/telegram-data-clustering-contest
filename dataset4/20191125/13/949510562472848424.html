      <p>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) — An intruder might have thought an 82-year-old woman living alone was an easy target, but he didn’t count on Willie Murphy being an award-winning bodybuilder with nerves of steel.</p>
      <p>Murphy tells WHAM she was getting ready for bed Thursday night when a man pounded on the door of her Rochester home saying he needed an ambulance. Murphy called police but wouldn’t open the door. Then the man broke in.</p>
      <p>Murphy says she clobbered him with a table, poured shampoo in his face and was beating him with a broom when police arrived. The man was sent to a hospital and police tweeted a selfie with Murphy, calling her “tough as nails.”</p>
      <p>Murphy works out almost daily at a Rochester gym and says she can deadlift 225 pounds.</p>
