      <h3>"We do have notes from people saying, 'Never have I had so much fun at work.'"</h3>
      <p><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/project-xcloud/">Project xCloud</a> has been in preview for more than a month in the US, the UK and Korea, and already Microsoft is learning a great deal about when — and where — its customers choose to use it.</p>
      <p>“What we’re testing for is engagement,” Catherine Gluckstein, General Manager of Project xCloud, told Stevivor at X019 in London. “We want to see [for] how long and how different[ly] the different types of customers are engaging [with xCloud].”</p>
      <p>Despite blazing internet speeds in Korea, Gluckstein confirmed that Project xCloud is used most “right here in the UK.”</p>
      <p>“The UK South is our busiest data center in the first month of the preview,” she continued. “Interestingly, [between] eight and 10 o’clock at night.”</p>
      <p>There are users being a tad naughty, Gluckstein confirmed.</p>
      <p>“Although we do have notes from people saying, ‘Never have I had so much fun at work,'” Gluckstein added with a laugh.</p>
