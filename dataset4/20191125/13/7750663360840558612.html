      <p>The Premier League giants are one of several high-profile European clubs who are keen to sign the Norway international at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>The Athletic</i>, United are concerned that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mino-raiola/"><b>Mino Raiola</b></a> - Haaland's agent - may make it difficult for them to bring in the youngster.</p>
      <p>The two parties are said to hold a strained relationship, although it is currently unclear whether this could have a detrimental effect on United's pursuit of the frontman.</p>
      <p>Haaland has contributed 23 goals from 19 appearances this season, with seven strikes coming from four outings in the Champions League.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/"><b>Barcelona</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/juventus/"><b>Juventus</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/rb-leipzig/"><b>RB Leipzig</b></a> are also considered strong contenders to sign the player.</p>
