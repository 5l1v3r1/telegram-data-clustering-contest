      <p>Antique <b>jewelry</b> worth about 1 billion euros was stolen from the Residenzschloss Museum in the centre of Dresden, Bild reported.</p>
      <p>This morning, Dresden police reported perhaps the largest theft in the country's post-war history, committed at the famous German Museum.</p>
      <p>The criminal group was found to have entered the <b>Grüne Gewölbe</b> (Green Vault).</p>
      <p>Antique <b>jewelry</b> from the state art collection - <b>King August II Strong's Treasure</b> was stolen.</p>
      <p>The criminals escaped.</p>
      <p>The centre is blocked by police cars and the museum is surrounded by law enforcement officials.</p>
      <p>Tabloid newspaper <i><a href="https://www.bild.de/regional/dresden/dresden-aktuell/grossalarm-nach-angeblichem-ueberfall-milliarden-coup-im-gruenen-gewoelbe-66254972.bild.html">Bild</a></i> reported that the museum's power supply was possibly sabotaged by a fire before the break-in. The responsible energy supplier confirmed the incident and said it was investigating if the two events were linked.</p>
      <p><i>Bild</i> reported that the <b>thieves</b> had exclusively targeted jewellery, and that they entered through a small window. There was no damage visible from outside the building, DW reported.</p>
