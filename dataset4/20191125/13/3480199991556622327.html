      <p>Heavy rains in Kenya unleashed a deluge that killed five people overnight in the Rift Valley, raising the death toll from weekend flooding to 65.</p>
      <p>The five were returning home after attending a wedding in Tanzania when their car was washed away, said Daudi Loronyokwe, a police chief in Kajiado Central community.</p>
      <p>The victims included three children, he said.</p>
      <p>Governor John Lonyang’apuo said between 80,000 and 120,000 people have been affected in West Pokot county, the worst hit by the floods and mudslides.</p>
      <p>The governor said at least 52 people were confirmed dead there.</p>

      <p>“I have lost three children,” said one resident, William Lokapel.</p>
      <p>He described how his wife managed to struggle to safety, clutching another child, after the mudslide covered their home while they slept.</p>
      <p>The torrential rain is uncommon for this time of year. Parts of the country could continue to face destructive flooding this week, the Kenya Red Cross said.</p>
      <p>“No one can sleep in their homes for now because we don’t know when the next landslide will occur,” resident Peter Lokor said.</p>
      <p>“So many people have been affected, actually all those who live in this area, and everybody is afraid of going back home.”</p>
      <p>The Kenya Red Cross cited what it called a record-breaking temperature rise in the Indian Ocean in recent weeks that also has caused flooding in South Sudan and Somalia.</p>
      <p>Now Djibouti is affected. The Horn of Africa nation’s capital reportedly saw more than three times its annual rainfall between Thursday and Sunday alone, the United Nations humanitarian office said.</p>
