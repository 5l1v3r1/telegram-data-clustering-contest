      <p>Post Malone just scored his fourth #1 hit on Billboard’s Hot 100. This week “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2056532/post-malone-circles/music/">Circles</a>” dethrones Lewis Capaldi’s “Someone You Loved,” which previously sat atop the chart for three nonconsecutive weeks. It’s the second #1 off Posty’s blockbuster <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2057594/post-malone-hollywoods-bleeding-review/franchises/the-week-in-pop/"><i>Hollywood’s Bleeding</i></a> following the Swae Lee collab “Sunflower,” first heard on the <i>Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse</i> soundtrack. His other chart-toppers include “Rockstar” with 21 Savage and “Psycho” with Ty Dolla $ign. Thus, this is Posty’s first time topping the Hot 100 all by himself.</p>
      <p>Since <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/category/franchises/the-week-in-pop/">The Week In Pop</a> won’t run this week due to Thanksgiving, we might as well run down the rest of this week’s action near the top of the charts. “Someone You Loved” falls to #2 on the Hot 100, followed by Lizzo’s “Good As Hell” and Maroon 5’s “Memories” at new respective peaks of #3 and #4. Selena Gomez’s “Lose You To Love Me,” which debuted at #1 a few weeks ago, climbs back to #5, followed by another former #1, Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello’s “Señorita,” at #6.</p>
      <p>After Chris Brown and Drake’s “No Guidance” at #7 comes Billie Eilish’s “Everything I Wanted” at #8, up from its #74 debut last week on just over 24 hours of tracking. Remarkably, it’s only Eilish’s second single to hit the top 10 following her #1 hit “Bad Guy.” Rounding out the top 10 are Dan + Shay and Justin Bieber’s “10,000 Hours” at #9 and Lizzo’s former chart champ “Truth Hurts” at #10.</p>
      <p>Over on the Billboard 200 albums chart, Céline Dion claims her first #1 in over 17 years, and fifth overall, with <i>Courage</i>. According to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8544604/celine-dion-first-no-1-album-in-over-17-years"><i>Billboard</i></a>, the album tallied 113,000 equivalent album units, largely comprising 109,000 in sales. Album/ticket bundling helped a lot, as it often does these days. Dion’s last #1 album was <i>A New Day Has Come</i> in 2002; her 17-year break between #1s is the longest ever by a woman.</p>
      <p>Tory Lanez enters at #2 with 83,000 units for <i>Chixtape 5</i>, including 73,000 streaming equivalent units derived from 94 million on-demand track streams. No other big debuts crash land into the upper reaches of the chart this week; the rest of the top 10 includes Post Malone, Taylor Swift, Luke Combs, YoungBoy Never Broke Again, Summer Walker, DaBaby, Billie Eilish, and Kanye West.</p>
