      <p>As some of us make a concerted effort to reduce our carbon footprint, we're looking for new ways to travel around quickly. Of course, there's already the bike but e-scooters give you a fun, new (and lazy) spin on getting places.</p>
      <p>Just remember to <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/e-scooter-laws-australia">check out our quick guide</a> to the laws surrounding e-scooters in Australia first.</p>

      <p>Keeping on brand with outdoors people who also like to relax every once and awhile, we bring to you the inflatable sleeping pad. Yes you can use this for camping by chucking in your tent but you can also use it on the beach, during picnics, at home with guests and wherever you damn well please (well, within reason). Make your gift recipient's outdoor trips a little more comfortable.</p>

      <p>If you've been to an urban park in 2019, you might've noticed some peculiar groups of people attempting to walk tightropes placed between two trees. This strange phenomenon is called slacklining and the coolest outdoors kids are doing it. It's sort of like crossing a tightrope except you fall a metre instead of 10. The best part is all your friend needs to get started is a slacklining kit (which you'll provide them with) and two sturdy trees around 15 metres or less apart. The local park is their oyster.</p>

      <p>A Swiss Army Knife is every outdoors person's best friend. It might not be able to chop fire wood but it sure will help with a lot of tasks you definitely didn't prepare for when you're out in the wild wilderness. Plus, it's just useful to have around the house anyway.</p>
