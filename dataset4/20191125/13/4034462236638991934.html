      <h1>Love Corvettes? The Ultimate Corvette Dream Job Awaits</h1>
      <h2>A 'Help Wanted' ad can change everything.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:20:33+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:20</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>Although the now settled UAW-GM strike delayed the start of C8 Corvette production until February, the Bowling Green Assembly plant in Kentucky still has plenty going on these days. Following the final C7 Corvette rolling off the production line, plant re-tooling is currently underway for the C8. Chevrolet expects demand to be high and, therefore, the plant must operate at maximum capacity. To do this, a sufficient number of factory employees are required and, it turns out, more are needed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.corvetteblogger.com/2019/11/22/corvette-assembly-plant-is-hiring-temporary-full-time-production-workers/">Corvette Blogger</a> noticed a help wanted ad on the National Corvette Museum's Facebook page seeking temporary full-time production workers as the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/corvette">2020 Corvette Stingray</a> and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/corvette-stingray-convertible">Corvette Stingray Convertible</a> prepares for series production this February. Temporary employees are also being sought for the surrounding areas for additional C8-related production duties.</p>

      <p>The Facebook ad states "These team member jobs require no degree and provide a pathway for permanent employment. With a $16.67 per hour start pay, opportunities range across multiple shifts and those hired receive benefits after 90 days." The fact more labor power is needed at Bowling Green is clearly a great sign the C8 Corvette is off to a solid start. If you recall, last August came word the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/is-the-2020-corvette-really-sold-out">C8 was potentially sold out</a> for model year 2020. A Chevrolet spokesperson quickly confirmed this was not the case and that orders were still being accepted for 2020.</p>

      <p>Last April, GM CEO Mary Barra announced the Corvette plant would be <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/chevy-needs-help-to-keep-up-with-demand-for-the-new-corvette">adding 400 jobs and a second shift</a> to accommodate expected demand for the new mid-engine 'Vette. The ad does not specifically state how many new employees will be hired. If you're a huge Corvette fan and dreamed of working at the only Corvette factory in the world, or you simply want a well-paying job with long-term potential, now's your chance. Good luck!</p>
