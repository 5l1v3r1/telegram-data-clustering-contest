      <p>A mechanic from Malacca, who goes by the name Pak Busu, gained the attention of the public when he posted on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2670785386346441&amp;set=a.783482758410056&amp;type=3&amp;theater">Facebook</a> about how difficult it is to support his family. This is because Pak Busu is disabled with no arms and no legs.</p>
      <p>However, he does not want to win the sympathy of others, he just wants to be able to put food on the table for his wife and two children, reported <a href="https://www.sinchew.com.my/content/content_2151867.html?fbclid=IwAR2Svi_eXCjY3RdxwwTt0Pdo5JhC4jGqwMDNjRwmNRIaL6jhO3bUTkFzzyo">Sin Chew Daily</a>.</p>

      <p>He shared that he is worried he cannot support his family as he only has very little customers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“People don’t want to send their cars to my garage for repair because they pity me,” he said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Don’t pity me, you should pity my wife and children who have no food to eat.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“I have the responsibility to work, to make a living for my wife and children. I have to give my children pocket money for school, pay for water, electricity, rent and so on.”</b>

      <p>Another reminded Pak Busu that he should be protected by insurance as he is doing high-risk work, but Pak Busu said that he is incapable of paying for it on time every month.</p>
      <p>In his latest post, Pak Busu thanked netizens who showed their support in the comments. But he also hopes that netizens will not misinterpret his intentions which might cause misunderstanding and criticism.</p>
      <p>
