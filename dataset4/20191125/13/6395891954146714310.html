      <p><b>ZAGREB, CroatiaÂ (AP)</b> - Thousands of state school teachers in Croatia have rallied in the capital Zagreb to demand higher wages, after expanding an ongoing strike last week to affect schools nationwide.</p>
      <p>Carrying banners and blowing whistles, protesting teachers and their supporters filled Zagreb's main square on Monday, pledging to carry on with their open-ended strike until their demands are met.</p>
      <p>Unionists say teachers' salaries are lagging behind those of other public employees. Talks with the government are planned later Monday.</p>
      <p>The strike started last month and was initially held on certain days of the week in a limited number of municipalities. But last week it was expanded nationwide and made open-ended to increase pressure on the government.</p>
      <p>Union leader Sanja Sprema said strikers "are fighting for the future of our children."</p>
