      <p>To borrow one of the favorite expressions of CBS play-by-play man Kevin Harlan, “oh my gosh” do I love the excitement he brings to a game.</p>
      <p>He should narrate the year-end highlights of every team in the NFL. He might even be able to make the winless Cincinnati Bengals season seem exciting.</p>
      <p>Listening to Harlan is like being next to an enthusiastic conversational guy sitting next to you at a corner bar.</p>
      <p>In Harlan’s world, players don’t sack quarterbacks as much as they corkscrew them into the ground or attack them like a runaway freight train.</p>
      <p>Let’s look at some of Harlan’s greatest hits during the Buffalo Bills’ 20-3 victory over the Denver Broncos Sunday.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>• On a long run by Bills rookie running back Devin Singletary as he refused to be tackled: “Oh, he’s moving the pile. Oh my goodness.”</p>
      <p>• After a 13-yard punt by Denver’s Colby Wadman: “Oh my goodness, off the side of his foot with the wind.”</p>
      <p>• On the Josh Allen to John Brown touchdown pass that gave the Bills an insurmountable 20-3 lead: “He’s got him. Touchdown John Brown. What a catch! 34 yards!”</p>
      <p>• On the Ed Oliver sack of Broncos quarterback Brandon Allen on the Broncos 1-yard line: “Here they come. Down he goes. Corkscrewed by the rookie Ed Oliver!”</p>
      <p>• On a Shaq Lawson sack: “Up the middle, like a runaway freight train!”</p>
      <p>• On the other Lawson sack: “Here goes Lawson, down goes Allen!”</p>
      <p>• On the Robert Foster 24-yard catch and run: “Look at him go. Oh, he pulled a hamstring.”</p>
      <p>But the written words don’t do Harlan justice; his excitement level and enthusiasm made a relatively dull, defensive-oriented game seem exciting.</p>
      <p>Harlan was as excited for every big play as he was calling play-by-play when a black cat went on the field on a recent "Monday Night Football" game.</p>
      <p>Analyst Rich Gannon is the perfect balance to Harlan. He is as low-key as Harlan is exciting.</p>
      <p>But the former quarterback and one-time most valuable player sees just about everything a quarterback in the game should see.</p>
      <p>He immediately pointed out that the runaway freight train named Lawson left the station without anyone blocking him on either of his sacks.</p>

      <p>Gannon beautifully described the pattern by Bills tight end Dawson Knox that freed Cole Beasley for his 18-yard touchdown that gave the Bills a 13-0 lead.</p>
      <p>He also instantly saw the double move by Brown that left Broncos cornerback Chris Harris in the dust on the 34-yard touchdown.</p>
      <p>The one area of the CBS broadcast that was disturbing concerned its camera work on multiple occasions.</p>
      <p>A camera focused on Bills offensive coordinator Brian Daboll in the first quarter that led to missing the start of a key third down. I’d rather watch the play than look at Daboll. CBS also missed the start of a punt.</p>
      <p>And it never showed a replay of the holding call on Bills offensive lineman Jon Feliciano near the Broncos goal line that eventually forced the Bills to kick a field goal rather than get a touchdown. The live shot appeared to show Feliciano pancake block a Bronco player. It would have been nice to hear if Gannon thought it was legal.</p>
      <p>CBS also didn’t show replays of the two block-in-the back penalties against the Bills’ Lorenzo Alexander. It also didn’t show a replay of a penalty against the Broncos.</p>
      <p>Those camera issues were almost as annoying as the insurance commercials featuring Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes. Please make them stop.</p>

      <p>Now on to more highs and lows in the broadcast:</p>
      <p><b>Back in the Day:</b> After a penalty was called against Denver’s Dalton Risner early in the game for jumping on Oliver while he was down, Gannon suggested “back in the day” it was “normal operating procedure” and probably wouldn’t have been called.</p>
      <p><b>Buffalove:</b> Early in the game, sideline reporter Jay Feely said “it is rockin’ down here. There is nothing better than Buffalo Bills football in Orchard Park.”</p>
      <p><b>Shady Comment:</b> After one of Singletary’s runs on his first 100-yard career game, Gannon said: “He can cut on a dime.” @CutonDime25 is the Twitter handle of former Bill LeSean McCoy.</p>
      <p><b>The List:</b> After a good Allen run, Gannon noted the Bills quarterback has run for more touchdowns since the start of last season than New York Giants back Saquon Barkley, Minnesota back Dalvin Cook and Dallas back Ezekiel Elliott. “That’s a list,” said Harlan.</p>

      <p><b>Dr. Harlan I Presume:</b> When Bills center Mitch Morse was injured, Harlan speculated that it might have had something to do with the preseason concussion he suffered. That was odd since you could see Morse was troubled by his hand, which Feely quickly explained.</p>
      <p><b>The Right Call:</b> When Bills coach Sean McDermott decided to kick a field goal inside the 5-yard line, Gannon said it was “the right call.” Stephen Hauschka’s kick made it 6-0.</p>
      <p><b>Music Report:</b> For the second time in a few weeks, CBS played some Goo Goo Dolls music as it went to a commercial break. And after running back Frank Gore went into third place in NFL history for yardage gained, CBS appropriately played “Forever Young.” Bills rookie tackle Cody Ford deserved to hear “The Sound of Silence” because we didn’t hear much from Broncos All-Pro rusher Von Miller during the game other than his one sack.</p>
      <p><b>Best Artwork:</b> After Gore passed Barry Sanders for third place, CBS showed a graphic of what it termed “Mount Rush More” with No. 1 Emmitt Smith, No. 2 Walter Payton, Gore and Sanders.</p>
      <p><b>Who Is Counting?</b> On the high throw on Josh Allen’s interception, Harlan said it was his first “in many passes.” The “many” made me laugh because who among us doesn’t occasionally hit a blank? Someone quickly told him the number was 172.</p>
      <p><b>The Big Mistake:</b> When Josh Allen unsuccessfully tried to call the Bills’ final timeout rather than get a delay penalty late in the first half, Gannon called it “a big mistake” that could hurt their chances of kicking a field goal. The Bills didn’t make many of them.</p>
      <p><b>Halftime Report:</b> Studio analyst Boomer Esiason said of Josh Allen and his interception: “We can tell he is good. Every now and then he gets a little loose.”</p>
      <p><b>The Cheerleader:</b> At one point, CBS’ camera caught McDermott channeling Bills defensive lineman Jordan Phillips by waving an arm to the crowd to make more noise.</p>
      <p><b>Blowing in the Wind:</b> It appeared the Broncos were going to go for it on a fourth down and 13 yards to go when they trailed, 13-0. “When you are 3-7, you might as well,” said Harlan. Feely speculated the wind led to coach Vic Fangio’s decision. The Bills called a timeout. And Fangio apparently changed his mind, sending out Brandon McManus to kick the Broncos’ only points of the game. You wonder if the Broncos would have gone for it if the Bills didn’t give them time to change their minds.</p>
      <p><b>The Double Minus:</b> After Allen threw a low pass that Brown dropped, Gannon said both players would get a minus during a film review. He called it “a double minus.” Their 34-yard touchdown must have been a double plus.</p>

      <p><b>Attention Pro Bowl Voters:</b> “Isn’t he something?” That’s what Harlan said of Bills linebacker Matt Milano, who was all over the field. Allen and the Bills also got love on NBC's "Sunday Night Football" pregame show.</p>
      <p><b>A Strange Timeout:</b> When Denver took a timeout with two seconds left in the third quarter when the Bills had the ball and the wind on a third down and two yards to go, Harlan and Gannon were as perplexed as anyone watching. “I’m really surprised,” said Gannon. “Maybe he didn’t have the right personnel out there.” The Bills got the first down anyway.</p>
      <p><b>That’s a Big Problem:</b> Gannon said at the start of the fourth quarter that the problem is the Broncos can’t score and added they had gone six straight games without a fourth-quarter touchdown.</p>
      <p><b>No Argument in Buffalo:</b> Harlan mentioned that the Bills signing of Brown and Baltimore’s signing of back Mark Ingram were the best free agent acquisitions of the year.</p>
      <p><b>Timing Is Everything:</b> Feely noted that Brown was timed at 4.8 seconds for the 40-yard dash in high school, which is why he wasn’t recruited by Division I football schools. He ran a 4.34 at the NFL Combine after college. “I question the timer,” said Gannon. “The last time he ran a 4.8 I think was in third grade.”</p>
      <p><b>Fooled You:</b> When the Bills appeared to be going for it on a fourth down and 4 at the Broncos 41, Gannon said, “I liked the aggressiveness.” If he spent as much time around the Bills as he said he had spent with the Broncos in the last month, he would have guessed that McDermott was just running the hard count play and never intended to snap the ball. At least Gannon was fooled. “Worth a try,” said Gannon when the ploy failed and the Bills punted.</p>
      <p><b>Gimme a Hug:</b> You could see Josh Allen and Feliciano were concerned before viewers learned Brown’s touchdown pass was ruled incomplete. Harlan understandably was late to see the officials initially call it an incompletion before McDermott successfully challenged it. Gannon instantly thought it was a touchdown, noting that Brown hugged the ball to his body. Harlan noted Allen’s pass “was against the word with that kind of accuracy.” He might have added that Allen’s inability to hit the deep pass this season has been an issue. Surprisingly, CBS rules expert Gene Steratore wasn’t brought in for a consultation.</p>
      <p><b>The Best Thing About Twitter:</b> The social network is at its best on challenges. Someone – or 10 people – will tweet whether the play is overturned or not before a network comes back from a commercial.</p>
      <p><b>It Was Inevitable:</b> Near the end of the game when talking about Gore’s impact on younger Bills, Gannon included his impact on Brandon Allen when he meant Josh Allen. There was no confusing them on the field Sunday.</p>
      <p><b>Say What?</b> Harlan said he heard there was some talk in the Buffalo media that the Bills might have been looking ahead to the Thanksgiving Day game against Dallas. Oh my goodness, I was unaware of that. The only such talk I heard came from Gannon, who suggested Bills fans shouldn’t overlook the Broncos, who had lost four games in the last 30 seconds.</p>
      <p><b>Reality Check:</b> The Bills head to 6-5 Dallas for the Thanksgiving Day game and are early seven-point underdogs, suggesting oddsmakers don’t think they are real despite their 8-3 record. I’m sure either Jim Nantz or Tony Romo will remind viewers that “back in the day” in the 1990s going to Super Bowls was “normal operating procedure” for both teams.</p>
