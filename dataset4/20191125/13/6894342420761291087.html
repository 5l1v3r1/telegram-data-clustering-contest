      <h1>Samsung Galaxy S11 5G Benchmark Appears Online; Allegedly Sporting Exynos 990 SoC, 12GB RAM</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:57:01+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/bryanlim/" target="_blank">Bryan Lim</a></address>
      <p>A benchmark result bearing the model number of “SM-G986B” has recently appeared online recently on GeekBench. According to SamMobile, it is believed that the device in question might be the Samsung Galaxy S11 5G, and the benchmark listed that it is equipped with an Exynos 990 SoC and 12GB of RAM.</p>
      <p>As Samsung has already announced the <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/197257/samsung-announces-exynos-990-soc-and-5g-exynos-modem-5123/">Exynos 990 SoC</a> a few months ago, it is no surprise that the upcoming flagship would be equipped with the new processor.</p>
      <p>Additionally, SamMobile also suggested that all Galaxy S11 series variants will ship with 12GB RAM. The move isn’t all that surprising; the Samsung-centric site pointed out that Samsung had made the move before by shipping the Note10 with the same amount of RAM for all variants of the phone.</p>

      <p>The alleged Galaxy S11 is also shown to be running on Android 10 as well. Again, this isn’t surprising, especially since almost all next-generation flagship devices from Samsung typically ship out with the latest and most up-to-date version of Google’s Android OS.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, a part of the benchmark seems to include a score for ray-tracing as well. Possibly, this could indicate that Samsung’s next-generation chipset is capable of running ray-tracing, which would make it the second chipset capable of the feat. The first one being Huawei’s own Kirin 990 SoC, running NetEase’s recently <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/200068/netease-show-off-real-time-ray-tracing-on-mobile-use-huawei-kirin-990-soc/">showcased</a> mobile ray-tracing in-game demo.</p>

      <p>As for now, we have heard a lot of rumours for the Samsung Galaxy S11 including its <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/199934/samsung-galaxy-s11-receives-certification-may-include-5g-connectivity-25w-fast-charging-and-more/">leaked designs</a> and <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/199934/samsung-galaxy-s11-receives-certification-may-include-5g-connectivity-25w-fast-charging-and-more/">features</a>. Nonetheless, it is important to take all rumours with the proverbial pinch of salt. At least, until the Galaxy S11 makes its inaugural debut next year.</p>
