      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Two state government offices previously at odds over Ohio's online checkbook are partnering to keep the website going.</p>
      <p>The state treasurer's office and the Office and Budget and Management recently announced the collaboration. Under previous administrations, the two offices launched separate, competing sites for searching state spending information.</p>
      <p>Republicans Lt. Gov. Jon Husted (HYOO'-sted) and Treasurer Robert Sprague said collaboration will mean better service at lower cost and will enhance transparency for the media and public.</p>
      <p>Their plan calls for OhioCheckbook.com, which provides government spending data, to continue while folding in revenue information from OBM's Interactive Budget.</p>
      <p>Then-Treasurer Josh Mandel (MAHN'-dehl) launched OhioCheckbook.com in 2014. He accused then-Gov. John Kasich (KAY'-sik) of undermining the site's future. Both are Republicans.</p>
      <p>Kasich said the budget office could provide more thorough information.</p>
