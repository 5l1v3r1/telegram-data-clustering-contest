      <ul>
        <li>Just last week Lyft co-founder was bullish on the stock.</li>
        <li>The sell-off by the insiders has netted millions of dollars.</li>
        <li>Lyft shares are currently on the rebound from last month’s record low.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On the day that Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) co-founder and President John Zimmer suggested that the stock was a buy, insiders at the ride-hailing firm including himself did the opposite – sell.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0001759509&amp;owner=include&amp;count=100">SEC filings published last week</a>, Lyft insiders sold a total of 137,000 shares combined on November 20<sup>th</sup>. Speaking to CNBC, Zimmer had on the same day billed <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/20/lyft-co-founder-john-zimmer-on-stock-plunge-since-ipo-in-march.html">Lyft’s stock as a good buy</a> calling it ‘undervalued’:</p>
      <blockquote>I feel like the stock is undervalued. We’ve had three quarters of beating expectations, and over time people will see us put up more numbers and it will solve itself.</blockquote>
      <h3>Do what I say not what I do?</h3>
      <p>Despite his statement, Zimmer went on to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759509/000120919119057875/xslF345X03/doc4.xml">sell the largest chunk</a> of shares relative to other insiders. He disposed of 39,037 shares at $43.60 netting him slightly over $1.7 million. As of last week, Zimmer’s stake in the ride-hailing firm consisted of 1,240,396 shares of Class A Common stock. Based on Friday’s <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NASDAQ%3ALYFT">closing price of $46.41</a>, the stake is worth approximately $57.6 million.</p>
      <p>Since Zimmer suggested that the stock is a buy, Lyft’s shares have gone up by around 6%. The stock closed at $43.95 on November 20<sup>th</sup> while Friday’s closing price was $46.46.</p>

      <h3>5 other Lyft insiders join John Zimmer in selling</h3>
      <p>Lyft’s co-founder and CEO Logan Green was the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1677874/000120919119057871/xslF345X03/doc4.xml">second-largest seller among insiders</a> on the same day. He disposed of 38,952 shares at $43.70 and this earned him approximately $1.7 million. As of Friday, the remaining number of shares that Green owns is just 85 more than Zimmer.</p>

      <p>Other insiders who sold the stock on November 20<sup>th</sup> include Lyft’s CFO Brian Roberts. He sold 17,589 shares at a price of $43.7985.</p>
      <p>Lyft’s executive vice president and chief product officer Ran Makavy, as well as general counsel &amp; Secretary Kristin Sverchek, sold 31,862 and 9,410 shares respectively. A director of the on-demand transportation firm Mary Wilderotter also disposed of 559 shares.</p>
      <h3>Lyft Insiders pocket millions of dollars</h3>
      <p>Combined the insiders earned slightly more than $6 million from the sale. This comes at a time when Lyft has lost billions of dollars in market cap following its IPO.</p>
      <p>Since going public in late March at a price of $72 a share, Lyft’s stock has fallen by around 35% as of Friday’s close. Just like its rival Uber, it is one of the worst-performing IPOs of 2019. The stock hit a record low of $37.07. It has gained around 25% from the record low registered last month. In the <a href="https://investor.lyft.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lyft-announces-record-third-quarter-results">third quarter, Lyft reported a net loss</a> just <a href="https://www.ccn.com/lyfts-loss-could-have-been-worse-investors-throw-the-stock-a-lifeline/">like in the second quarter</a> and the quarter prior.</p>
