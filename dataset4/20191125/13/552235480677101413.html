      <h1>Rangers captain James Tavernier is diabolical and Steven Gerrard needs to drop him - Hotline</h1>
      <h2>Gavin Berry takes your calls as a win over Hamilton doesn't please every Gers fan.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:04:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:04</time> by <a rel="author">Sports Hotline, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sports-hotline/</a></address>
      <p>Rangers can make it seven wins on the spin for the first time in just over a decade while in the top flight if they beat Feyenoord in Rotterdam on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>It would be quite an achievement for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> and his side as three Europa League points in De Kuip would secure a place in the knockout stage of the continent’s second tier competition.</p>
      <p>And as they sit level on points with rivals and eight-in-a-row champions <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> at the Scottish Premiership summit ahead of next month’s Old Firm Betfred Cup final, things are going well down Govan way.</p>
      <p>But if there are negatives to be found amid the positive mood then you can always rely on the <i><b>Hotline</b> </i>to come up with them and it was no different after Sunday’s 3-1 win over Hamilton Accies.</p>
      <p>That made it six victories in a row - Walter Smith’s side managed seven towards the end of their double-winning 2008/09 campaign - ahead of a meeting with former Gers boss Dick Advocaat’s Dutch side.</p>

      <p>But <b>Dougie Tipping, Balloch,</b> said: “When is Steven Gerrard going to realise his two blue-eyed boys <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/james-tavernier">James Tavernier</a> and Connor Goldson aren’t good enough.</p>
      <p>“They are absolutely diabolical but play every week. Ally McCoist was right when he criticised the pair of them in his post-match analysis for BT Sport.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to Rotterdam for Thursday’s game and I don’t see how he can play the two of them. Nikola Katic must be wondering how he can’t get into that team - Goldson’s a bombscare.”</p>
      <p><b>Alan Clark</b> emailed: “Steven Gerrard has got to play his best striker from the start in all matches and, provided he is fit, that means Alfredo Morelos with Jermain Defoe on the bench.</p>

      <p>“Starting with Defoe up front against the so-called smaller teams is going to prove costly to Rangers one of these weeks.”</p>
      <p><b>Lewis Fotheringham, Mount Ellen,</b> said: “It was a poor performance from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> but still a good result against Hamilton Accies.</p>
      <p>“That is a game we would have lost last season. Allan McGregor was busier than I thought he would be - I assumed he’d have had time to do his weekly shopping in the Sainsbury’s behind the stadium.”</p>
      <p><b>James Robertson, Dennistoun,</b> said: “Alex Rae exclusively revealed there’s to be a major cash injection into Rangers at the start of the new year but what he declined to mention is that his source is his wee mum.”</p>
      <p><b>Jim Kerr, Renfrew,</b> said: “Steven Gerrard asked to see the real Rangers on the back page of Monday’s <i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>. Someone will have to tell him he’ll have to go back to 2012 for that.”</p>
      <p><b>Alan McGaw, Alloa,</b> said: “It was a difficult game at Hamilton but we’ve won four games on astroturf while avoiding any injuries so we’re clearly over the psychological barrier of plastic pitches.</p>

      <p>“You have to win ugly at times and all that matters is keeping in touch with Celtic and now we move on to trying to quality for the last-32 of the Europa League.</p>
      <p>“Ryan Kent and Ryan Jack were both outstanding, with the latter probably just edging it for man of the match, but Kent’s first goal was outstanding.”</p>
      <p><b>Frank McFerran, Carrickfergus,</b> said: “I know it’s early in the league race but it will be interesting to see who blinks first. Both teams seem to be winning without playing exceptional football.”</p>
      <p>Nine-man St Johnstone held Aberdeen to a 1-1 draw at McDiarmid Park in the other Sunday game with Dons boss Derek McInnes hitting out Kevin Clancy for failing to award the visitors a spot-kick for handball.</p>

      <p><b>Rab Hunter, Dumfries,</b> said: “It wasn’t a great advert for Scottish football at Perth but certainly a total embarrassment from an officiating point of view.</p>
      <p>“How such a blatant handball incident can be missed/ignored simply brings our game into disrepute, for which once again there will be no repercussions.</p>
      <p>“A situation that has to change if our game is to improve.”</p>
      <p><b>Andrew Lamb, Fraserburgh,</b> said: “Tommy Wright has a brass neck as usual, trying to defend his side’s appalling brand of football.</p>

      <p>“Had Aberdeen scored a second there was no way the Perth club were coming back and quite frankly they stole a share of the points in Sunday’s game.</p>
      <p>"Here’s hoping they are relegated.”</p>
      <p>Hearts are still on the hunt for a new boss with current caretaker Austin MacPhee launching a blistering attack on radio pundit and former player Allan Preston for criticising his credentials.</p>
      <p><b>Barra Stevens, Edinburgh,</b> said: “Michael Stewart and Allan Preston weren’t great players but they think they know it all when speaking on the BBC.</p>
      <p>“The attitude of the two of them is terrible and Peter Grant and MacPhee have now both accused them of lies and they should be accountable as they haven’t denied it.</p>
      <p>“They campaigned for Gordon Strachan to lose his job as Scotland boss and look at the state of us now and they were the same with Craig Levein. What did Allan Preston do as a manager at Livingston?”</p>
