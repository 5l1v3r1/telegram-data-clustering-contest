      <p>Boris Johnson has trimmed a sheep and served beef and lamb baps as he got stuck into country life at the Royal Welsh Winter Fair.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister took a pair of scissors to the North Country Cheviot as he toured the agricultural show in the marginal Brecon and Radnorshire constituency.</p>
      <p>The seat was won by the Liberal Democrats’ Jane Dodds earlier this year at a by-election triggered by a recall petition after Tory Chris Davies was convicted of faking expenses claims.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson toured the fair with the Conservative candidate Fay Jones, and served several beef and lamb baps at a food stall – donning an apron as he asked customers: “Can I interest you in a lamb bap?”</p>
      <p>He then inspected some prize cattle in the bull ring – but one black bull became agitated as the PM toured the arena and had to be walked away.</p>
      <p>It was rumoured that Mr Johnson would trim a sheep named Corbyn, but he instead trimmed one whose name could not be ascertained.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister, who posed with a tractor and was given a food hamper as he left, will launch his party’s Welsh manifesto later on Monday.</p>
