      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> has dismissed rumours he wants his new club <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> to sign <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/zlatan-ibrahimovic/">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a>.</p>
      <p>Prolific striker Ibrahimovic worked under Mourinho at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> and has been linked with a move to Spurs since the Portuguese manager took over from Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>But Mourinho says it does not make sense for Tottenham to move for Ibrahimovic as the north Londoners already have ‘top striker’ Harry Kane.</p>
      <p>‘I would say we have one of the top strikers in England,’ Mourinho said ahead of Tottenham’s Champions League clash against Olympiacos.</p>
      <p>‘It doesn’t make any sense of a striker of Zlatan’s dimension to come to a club where we have Harry Kane.’</p>
