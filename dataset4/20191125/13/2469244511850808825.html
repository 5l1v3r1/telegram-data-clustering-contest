      <p>An angry father left his ex partner shaking like a jelly after he threatened her with a baseball bat and snatched a two-year-old baby.</p>
      <p>Kurtis Richardson held up the bat and said 'this is a threat' before leaving the house in Newton Abbot with the child in one hand and the weapon in the other.</p>
      <p>Neighbours saw his ex girlfriend follow him into the street while shouting 'give me my baby back' as Richardson got into a waiting car and drove off.</p>
      <p>She made a victim impact statement which said:"I don't feel safe in my own home. My children were petrified. I am always anxious about what he will do.</p>
      <p>"When he ran off with my child, I felt my whole world was crashing around me. I felt as if I could not breath and my legs went to jelly. I feel he is capable of doing anything. I want to feel safe and want my children to feel safe."</p>
      <p>Richardson, aged 24, of Webster Close, Newton Abbot, denied common assault and possession of a baseball bat in Tamworth Close, Newton Abbot, but was found guilty by magistrates and the case sent to Exeter Crown Court for sentence.</p>
      <p>Judge Peter Richardson adjourned sentence until later this week to await a report from a social worker about contact arrangements for the child.</p>
      <p>Mr Thomas Faulkner, prosecuting, said the incident in Tamworth Close started at 5 pm on July 15 this year where residents saw Richardson with the bat before he went to his ex partner's home nearby.</p>
      <p>Mr Faulkner said:"He entered the property without permission carrying the baseball bat and said 'this is a threat', and putting the victim in fear of violence as he crouched down next to the baby.</p>
      <p>"He grabbed the baby and fled, while still holding the bat. he was seen by neighbours who heard loud screams and a woman shouting 'give me my baby back'.</p>
      <p>"Police arrived at his home shortly afterwards and he was found with the child with him and arrested. This incident caused very serious alarm and distress to his ex partner and a vulnerable two-year-old child."</p>
      <p>Mr Jeffrey Segan, defending, said the incident happened in the context of a dispute over who would bring up the child, who he had looked after for 18 months.</p>
      <p>He said nobody had been hurt in the incident and Richardson had not used the baseball bat. Magistrates found him guilty of the common assault charge on the basis of the threats alone.</p>
