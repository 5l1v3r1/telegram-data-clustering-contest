      <p>T.I. addressed those controversial remarks about his daughter during an appearance on the latest episode of “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/redtabletalk/">Red Table Talk</a>“.</p>
      <p>The rapper appeared on Jada Pinkett Smith’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/redtabletalk/">Facebook Watch show,</a> alongside his wife Tameka “Tiny” Harris, after hitting headlines around the world for saying he took his daughter Deyjah Harris to the gynecologist annually to “check her hymen.”</p>
      <p>T.I. made the comments on a recent episode of <a href="https://etcanada.com/news/536334/rapper-t-i-says-he-goes-with-his-18-year-old-daughter-to-the-gynecologist-to-make-sure-her-hymen-is-still-intact/">Nazanin Mandi and Nadia Moham’s podcast “Ladies Like Us”. It’s since been deleted.</a></p>
      <p>The star said of “Hymen Gate”: “I think this surrounds a conversation I was having in a very joking manner. I just began to – from a place of truth – I began to embellish and exaggerate. I think people kinda took it extremely literal, because if you put any of my reputation… who I am as a father, who I been… I honestly thought people knew me better than that.”</p>
      <p>He added, according to <i><a href="https://www.complex.com/music/2019/11/ti-tiny-jada-pinkett-smith-red-table-talk-remarks-about-daughter">Complex</a></i>: “Let me go set this record straight: I never said I was in any exam room. That was an assumption. I never said that it was being done present day, as an 18-year-old.”</p>

      <p>Tiny, who was in the appointment with her daughter at the time, confirmed she was “15 and 16-years-old” when it happened.</p>
      <p>T.I. insisted, “There was never any objection. She did have a problem with me talking about it, however, and I understand that. I am incredibly apologetic to her for that. Not to any of these other strangers or any of these weirdos who, you know, just kinda toss lies around for fun. She understands my intentions and she knows who I am.”</p>

      <p>He continued, “I think that in the age or time where our women – black women – are the most unprotected, unattended, disregarded women on the planet… I’m being criticized because I’m willing to go above and beyond to protect mine. I’m talking about all of the little slimy, grimy, chubby-fingered little boys who want to just come and defile and destroy the sanctity.”</p>
      <p>He added: “To me I’m here to protect all of the children from themselves until they make it to a point where they have awareness, a sense of self, and discernment. Since she’s turned 18, I don’t have control of anything, it’s on you. Run, fly, be yourself. I’m not there to protect virginity, I just know that is a big move.”</p>
