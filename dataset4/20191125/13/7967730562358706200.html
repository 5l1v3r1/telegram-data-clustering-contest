      <h1>Could cutting out toxic people actually be hurting you?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:02:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:02</time> by <a rel="author">Jenny Haward</a></address>
      <p>The phrase "toxic people", first <a href="https://www.drlillianglass.com/dr-lillian-glass-communication-psychology-of-human-behavior-bio/">coined by psychologist Dr. Lillian Glass back in 1995</a>, has spawned a litany of advice and self-help literature, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?page=7&amp;q=toxic+relationships&amp;qid=b4OY40kRbN&amp;tab=books">offering everything from poetry to psychic training. </a>Unless you are exceptionally lucky, at some point in the past you’ve probably identified a toxic relationship and believed the healthiest thing to do was remove that person from your life.</p>
      <p>My own rather dramatic experience of cutting out a toxic friend in my 20s involved writing a four page "friendship break-up" speech and calling the friend who had deeply hurt me to read it aloud. As my monologue on his betrayal drew to a close, so did our relationship.</p>

      <p>Not every romance or friendship is healthy, or destined to last forever. But can repeatedly cutting out people who make us unhappy cause unpleasant personal repercussions?</p>
      <p><a href="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s12144-019-00381-z?author_access_token=F0C0Scf3_DHuMHXFkyqRPfe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6gJGqk9BBdzo4dJLh02Yqn38IU4Nt7DpCTHVlQSj2_NYN1j3ovk2nklO3V2gsduSPT6R8D0-8Ic_s1h96rXjK9feu8m-znerOglJbXqOt5Ew%3D%3D&amp;fbclid=IwAR04k2TYmvKu2JHXPxhHjPBwKT9X9_xFcP9V9SQewQnOrlwG-ZTAaCy4ACc">New research from the State University of New York at New Paltz</a> has indicated a high number of social estrangements is associated with social and emotional problems.</p>
      <p>Participants completed personality and behavioural assessments, and were asked to disclose all estrangements where they and the other person (for example, a romantic partner, friend or family member) were “totally cut off”, as well as who initiated the cut off. Those with a high number of “cutoffs” also displayed high scores on measures such as depressive tendencies and anxious attachment.</p>
      <p>Professor Glenn Geher, who led the research, said the results of the studies showed “it’s bad for people psychologically to be cut off from a large number of others in the world”.</p>

      <p>“Yes, every now and again a relationship can hit a downward spiral and become toxic. But I’d say that, based on our results, we probably should be especially cautious about going so far as to write someone off for life. All kinds of adverse, and often unintended, consequences follow from cutoffs, such as depression, a feeling of low social support, and anxiety."</p>
      <p><a href="https://melissaferrari.com.au/">Sydney psychotherapist Melissa Ferrari</a> says the current trend for ditching toxic people is likely related to the way we have evolved as a society.</p>
      <p>“Modern society is all about the disposable and this includes our relationships, so if we find ourselves in a situation where a relationship has come to feel toxic to us, then it is easier to throw it away than to try and work through the issues that have arisen,” Ferrari says, adding that counselling can be a useful tool to work through issues in relationships or part ways amicably.</p>
      <p>Of course, deeply unhealthy or troubled relationships are certainly worth ditching, and particularly those where you feel physically or emotionally threatened.</p>

      <p>“If it is a terrible relationship that has been battering your self-esteem, then you need to get out, with the benefit being the relief it is over and the opportunity to reset your life,” Ferrari says. “Our relationships must be safe and secure, so if you feel unsafe, or if there is any sign of violence in the relationship, then it must end immediately, for the safety of all.”</p>
      <p>However, in some cases, she believes the extreme act of cutting someone out is something we should take time to consider fully.</p>
      <p>“Making the decision to ‘cut’ someone from your life is not an easy one to make and comes with a cost, particularly if it is a long-term partner, or someone who you have been close to through life. It can, in many ways, create similar feelings of grief as death.”</p>
      <p>Geher explains that dealing with someone whose behaviour is toxic to you or someone who has betrayed you can be dealt with by distancing yourself in a less explicit way, adding that such a subtle tactic may help to avoid the adverse consequences of a full-blown cutoff.</p>
      <p>Yet estrangements often follow from some sort of betrayal in a relationship, and so they can be tricky to forgive.</p>

      <p>“But forgiveness is possible under many conditions and research regularly shows that genuine forgiveness has the capacity to increase the well-being of the forgiver,” Geher says.</p>
      <p>After a six month cooling off period, my friend and I sat down for coffee and buried the hatchet. I forgave him for the perceived betrayal and he forgave me for subjecting him to a five minute monologue detailing his faults. Our friendship didn’t return to what it had been, and that was fine with both of us. But I felt better knowing that we had left things on a positive note, and I hope that he did too.</p>
      <p>Indeed, finding peace with someone who you would like to cut off can actually be a cathartic experience for all.</p>
      <p>“When possible, genuine forgiveness is a truly empowering experience that is really something of a best possible solution for both parties,” Geher says.</p>
