      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:07:59+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:07</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Lewis Hamilton says he will not let his pursuit for Formula One immortality destroy his life.</p>
      <p>The British sensation, 34, is now just one title short of equalling Michael Schumacher's record haul of seven world championships.</p>
      <p>Six-time world champ Hamilton will mount that charge next season when he enters the last year of his current Â£40million-a-year contract with Mercedes.</p>
      <p>But the Stevenage-born racer, who is also just eight grand prix wins shy of the German's all-time win tally, will not let his quest for success take over his life.</p>
      <p>"There are the drivers and athletes who train all day, every day, too much, they're too focused, they're too intense," said Hamilton, who is in the betting to be confirmed as one of the six nominees for Sports Personality of the Year 2019.</p>

      <p>"I read this book, The Alchemist, and I liked the story. There is this kid who meets the King. The King says to him: 'I don't have time for you right this second, but take this spoon with a drop of oil. I want you to go round to my house, enjoy it, and come back to me later. But don't drop any of the oil'.</p>
      <p>"So, the kid goes around focusing on making sure he doesn't drop any of the oil, and when he comes back, the King asks him: 'Did you see my great sculptures? Did you see my great paintings?' And the kid says he didn't because he was too focused on the spoon.</p>
      <p>"That spoke a lot to me. You can focus so much on your career, and doing the perfect job, that you miss the world and your whole life can go by.</p>

      <p>"For everyone there are certain sacrifices and choices you have to make.</p>
      <p>"When you win a world championship, it does feel incredibly rewarding because of the effort you have put in, and there are things you could have done that you didn't do in the hope that it will position yourself better. It really is about finding the right balance.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn't change my life. I wouldn't go back and change any of the sacrifices that I have made. I wouldn't change anything. Racing has given my life purpose."</p>
