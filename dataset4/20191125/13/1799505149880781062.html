      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Charles Schwab is buying rival TD Ameritrade for $26 billion, a blockbuster deal accelerated by massive disruption in the online brokerage industry.</p>
      <p>Competitive pressure has forced brokerages to make it free for customers to trade U.S. stocks online, and Schwab’s proposal would combine two of the biggest players in the industry.</p>

      <p>The merger would create a company so big that it may draw sharp scrutiny from antitrust regulators. Together the companies would have more than $5 trillion in client assets under management.</p>
      <p>By itself, Schwab may control close to half the market for acting as a custodian for money managed by registered investment advisers, while TD Ameritrade may control 15% to 20%, according to Kyle Voigt, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, investment bankers.</p>
      <p>The rewards for passing regulatory muster would be lucrative. A combined company “makes strong strategic sense,” would be able to cut costs and could bump up Schwab’s earnings per share by more than 25% over the long term, Voigt said.</p>
      <p>The deal could also herald more mergers across the industry.</p>
      <p>“If this deal occurs, smaller players may get squeezed further on pricing,” said Michael Taiano, senior director at Fitch Ratings.</p>
      <p>Schwab last rocked the industry less than two months ago, when it said it would do away with commissions for online trading of U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds, fees that have long fueled the industry. All major brokerages have followed suit.</p>
      <p>Fees have been dropping across the investment industry for years, not just for buying a stock but also for holding a mutual fund or ETF.</p>
      <p>Beyond players like Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Fidelity and E-Trade Financial, apps like robinhood.com out of Palo Alto, California, have entered the fray to help customers get invested in the market.</p>
      <p>That has increased the pressure on Schwab Corp. and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp., of Omaha, the biggest publicly traded brokerages. Schwab had $3.85 trillion in client assets at the start of November, while TD Ameritrade had $1.3 trillion at the end of September.</p>
