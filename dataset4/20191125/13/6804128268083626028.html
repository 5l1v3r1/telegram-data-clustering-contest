      <h1>The reason Mauricio Pochettino will not take the Arsenal job and it has nothing to do with Spurs</h1>
      <h2>Gary Neville has been speaking about Mauricio Pochettino and the potential of him replacing Unai Emery at Arsenal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:15:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United great Gary Neville has sent a strong warning to Mauricio Pochettino over the possibility of taking over at Arsenal.</p>
      <p>Unai Emery continues to be under intense pressure at the Gunners thanks to a poor run of form in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are now seventh in the top tier after a disappointing 2-2 draw at home to Southampton on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Pochettino, meanwhile, left Tottenham last week and was replaced by Jose Mourinho after five largely successful seasons.</p>
      <p>The Argentine led Spurs to four successive top-four finishes and a Champions League final appearance in June but Tottenham were 14th in the league ahead of beating West Ham on Sunday.</p>
      <p>With Pochettino being heavily linked with replacing Emery at Arsenal, former United star turned pundit Neville has now issued this warning.</p>
      <p>"Mauricio Pochettino will get linked with every single job in the next three months," Neville told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"I think he is in a position where he can select where he goes next, he’s in a strong position and his next job will be one of the super clubs in Europe.</p>
      <p>"Arsenal would be interesting. It’s happened before George Graham going the other way. Would Spurs fans like that? Would Mauricio do that? Would Arsenal do that?</p>
      <p>"I’m not sure Mauricio would want to do something like that to Spurs. Taking over at Arsenal would be similar to the job he just left at Tottenham, in the sense that there is some investment and spending, but it’s limited.</p>

      <p>"He’s not going to go to Arsenal and win the league in the next two years. Whatever the next job Mauricio takes, he will want to win trophies, that will be the most important factor in the decision."</p>
