      <p>ATHLETICS IRELAND HAVE announced a 40-strong team for next month’s European Cross Country Championships in Lisbon, Portugal.</p>
      <p>2011 and 2012 European XC champion Fionnuala McCormack, who landed the national title in style yesterday, and recent 1,500m World Championship finalist Ciara Mageean — the 2018 national champion — will spearhead the Irish women’s senior team.</p>
      <p>Wicklow native McCormack was in stunning form in Abbotstown yesterday as she and her sister, Una Britton, <a href="https://www.the42.ie/national-cross-country-championships-fionnuala-mccormack-una-britton-4904791-Nov2019/">made history on the podium</a>. Mageean was absent, but had thrown her hat in the ring for Europeans a few weeks back.</p>
      <p>Britton, who finished third yesterday, second-placed Mary Mulhare and Armagh AC’s Fionnuala Ross make up the exciting team, while newly-crowned national champion Liam Brady of Tullamore Harriers AC will lead the senior men’s team.</p>
