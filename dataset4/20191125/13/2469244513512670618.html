      <p>ORQUAY United have a home draw in the First Round of the Buildbase FA Trophy - against old league and cup rivals Aldershot Town.</p>
      <p>The Gulls and the Shots will meet at Plainmoor on Saturday, December 14.</p>
      <p>It will give United, losing finalists in the 2008 Trophy Final, an attractive pre-Christmas and holiday programme - home to Aldershot on the 14th, and then to Chesterfield (Dec 21) before the Boxing Day/New Year's Day double-header against Yeovil Town away and home, split by Woking at Plainmoor on December 28.</p>
      <p>Gary Johnson's Gulls have already beaten Aldershot once this season, 2-0 at Plainmoor in the National League in August, and they will collect Â£4,500 in prizemoney if they can overcome them again next month.</p>
      <p>The Shots are currently 18th in the NL table.</p>
      <p>Torquah-v-Aldershot was one of only two all-National League ties in Monday's draw - the other will see Sutton United host Dagenham &amp; Redbridge.</p>
      <p>But there will be three NL clashes in the Northern Section.</p>
      <p>Top of the bill is the meeting of Chesterfield and Notts County at the Proact Stadium, but Harrogate Town also entertain Hartlepool United and FC Halifax Town are at home to Wrexham.</p>
      <p>Holders AFC Fylde play Curzon Ashton at Mill Farm.</p>
