      <p>The <b>Isuzu D-Max</b> has won the <b>2019 SuperUtes championship</b> in the hands of young Kiwi ace <b>Tom Alexander</b>, who secured the title with one race remaining after establishing an unassailable lead.</p>
      <p>Last weekend’s <b>Supercars Newcastle 500</b> was also the <b>finale</b> <b>for</b> <b>diesel-powered double cabs</b>, having trialled the format for two years following the end of local production of <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/ford/falcon/">Ford Falcon</a> and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/holden/commodore/">Holden Commodore V8</a> utes.</p>
      <p>The SuperUtes series will switch to <b>V8 power next year</b>, although the vehicles will look largely the same and the category will stick to double-cab ute bodystyles, which now represent the top two selling vehicles outright in Australia in the form of the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/toyota/hilux/">Toyota HiLux</a> and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/ford/ranger/">Ford Ranger</a>.</p>

      <p>The SuperUtes on the grid in 2020 will likely share a common V8 and possibly be governed by weight parity to keep the racing as close as possible.</p>
      <p>The 2019 championship-winning Isuzu D-Max was prepared and campaigned by motorsport veteran and talent-spotter Ross Stone, formerly of V8 Supercar fame, who in the early 2000s helped elevate Marcos Ambrose to stardom and delivered Bathurst 1000 wins to Steven Richards and Jason Bright.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/isuzu/dmax/">Isuzu D-Max</a> took out the 2019 SuperUtes championship after 25-year-old Kiwi Tom Alexander – who won the 2015 <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/toyota/86/">Toyota 86</a> racing series in New Zealand before entering SuperUtes in a <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/holden/colorado/">Holden Colorado</a> last year – scored five wins and 15 podium finishes from 24 races this season.</p>

      <p>“He had the right tool for the job this year, switching from the (Holden) Colorado to the (Isuzu) D-Max for the 2019 season, which performed incredibly well and allowed him to consistently earn points all season, rather than focusing on outright race wins,” said Stone.</p>
      <p>“It’s a strategy that has worked for champions all around the world and I’m proud to see Tommy lift the championship trophy at the end of this season.” he said.</p>
      <p>The size of the SuperUtes field has ebbed and flowed this year, from a peak of 14 entrants to a low of nine. The return to V8 power in 2020 is intended to bring fans and competitors back to the category.</p>

      <p>The SuperUtes series will continue to race on the Supercars calendar next year but the exact dates are yet to be announced.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year one of the team bosses, Brett Peters, who runs a pair of <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/mazda/bt50/">Mazda BT50s</a> and a <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/holden/colorado/">Holden Colorado</a>, told <a href="https://www.speedcafe.com/2019/10/25/superutes-set-for-v8-switch-to-become-cool-again/">Speedcafe.com.au</a>: “The best chance for utes to continue … is to put a V8 in them, make them have good horsepower, make the right sound, make them look cool, and then the category can grow.”</p>
      <p>Peters said fans want to see “flames” coming out of V8 exhausts. “Make them look cool, but still leave them identifiable as (Toyota) HiLuxes or (Ford) Rangers … all the things that people drive”, he told Speedcafe.com.au last month.</p>
      <p>However, the 2019 championship-winning Isuzu D-Max team is yet to decide if it will participate in the new V8 format.</p>
      <p>“Off the back of the win we would love to build on this, so for us it’s a shame the category is shifting to petrol V8s, as the strength of the D-Max is the 3.0-litre turbo diesel engine,” said Isuzu Ute Australia sponsorship and media manager Mark Harman. “We are still considering the 2020 SuperUtes series with the new regulations.”</p>
      <p>Isuzu said the only reason they got involved in SuperUtes in the first place was because team owner Ross Stone approached them due to the suitability of the D-Max engine. “He believed that was the best chance of winning the championship. We are very proud of what they've achieved with our vehicle,” said Harman.</p>
