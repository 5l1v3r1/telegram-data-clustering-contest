      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-city/"><b>Manchester City</b></a> striker suffered a thigh injury in the Premier League champions' victory over Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Guardiola is unsure how long he will be without the club's record goalscorer but he is already resigned to him missing the home clash with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a> on December 7.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a press conference to preview Tuesday's Champions League clash with Shakhtar Donetsk, Guardiola said: "He will be out a few games, a few weeks. I don't know exactly."</p>

      <p>Asked about the United game, the Spaniard added: "Maybe we will have a miracle but I don't think so."</p>
      <p>Aguero's absence will mean an opportunity for Brazil striker Gabriel Jesus to lead the line.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old said: "I am not happy because Sergio is injured. I don't like it when my friends are injured but I work here every day and I am ready to play. Every time in the training session because I want to improve everything."</p>
      <p>Spanish pair <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/rodri/"><b>Rodri</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/david-silva/"><b>David Silva</b></a> will be available to face Shakhtar after they were withdrawn against Chelsea with cramp.</p>
