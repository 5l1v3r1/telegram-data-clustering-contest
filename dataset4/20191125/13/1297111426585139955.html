      <h1>Regina Pats savouring the sounds of victory</h1>
      <h2>The Regina Pats are enjoying their first winning streak of the campaign after victories in Brandon and Swift Current on the weekend.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:00:56+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/gregharderlp" target="_blank">Greg Harder</a></address>
      <p>The Regina Pats’ bus driver laid on the air horn while pulling away from Westoba Place in Brandon on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>It was music to the ears of head coach Dave Struch, whose players were celebrating in the background after their second straight WHL road victory — <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/regina-pats-win-back-to-back-road-games-edge-brandon-wheat-kings-5-4">a 5-4 decision over the Brandon Wheat Kings</a>.</p>
      <p>The Pats had followed the same routine on Friday night thanks to a <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/regina-pats-erupt-for-blowout-win-over-swift-current-broncos">6-0 pummelling of the Swift Current Broncos</a>.</p>
      <p>Just 24 hours later, Regina savoured back-to-back wins for the first time this season.</p>
      <p>“The players deserve it so much because of all the work they’ve put in,” Struch explained. “The past five, six weeks of work ethic is paying off. It’s special because, by doing things the right way and believing in the process that defines the program, you do get rewarded.</p>
      <p>“These are the organic team builders that we talk about when you go through a tough time like we have. The resiliency that the players have shown is a big part of us becoming a better team.”</p>
      <p>It has been a difficult road for the Pats (5-14-2-0), who lost 10 straight games after a 3-2 opening-night victory over the Moose Jaw Warriors.</p>
      <p>That streak ended on Oct. 16 with a <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/regina-pats-snap-skid-with-shootout-win-over-red-deer-rebels">6-5 shootout win over the Red Deer Rebels</a>.</p>
      <p>Since then, Regina is 4-4-2-0.</p>
      <p>“It does (feel good) but it’s just the start,” Struch said. “We have to build on it. We have to work harder because teams now are going to prepare a little bit different for us when you’re playing better hockey. We can’t level off. We have to continue to get better.”</p>
      <p>In addition to their dogged work ethic, the Pats have been sparked by several additions to their lineup.</p>
      <p>The list includes defenceman <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/zach-wytinck-embraces-opportunity-to-help-out-the-rebuilding-regina-pats">Zach Wytinck</a> (trade with Brandon), forward <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/zack-smith-made-a-memorable-outdoor-debut-with-the-regina-pats">Zack Smith</a> (signed out of the SJHL), forward <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/newcomer-caiden-daley-looks-forward-to-fresh-start-with-regina-pats">Caiden Daley</a> (trade with Brandon), forward <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/searching-for-more-firepower-regina-pats-pull-the-trigger-on-trade-for-carter-chorney">Carter Chorney</a> (trade with Swift Current) and forward<a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/regina-product-carson-denomie-embraces-homecoming-after-being-traded-to-pats"> Carson Denomie</a> (trade with Moose Jaw).</p>
      <p>Chorney and Denomie each had a goal on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“We’ve added some real good pieces along the way that are impacting our game,” Struch said. “You can see they want to be here and they want to do things the right way. They’re very eager. Those have been real key additions for us.</p>
      <p>“When you go through what we’ve gone through, you need to keep the chemistry in the room. They’ve just added to that chemistry.”</p>
      <p>Another of the new additions, backup goaltender <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/goaltender-donovan-buskey-excited-to-join-regina-pats-crowded-crease">Donovan Buskey,</a> earned his first victory with the Pats on Saturday.</p>
      <p>It was Buskey’s first appearance since his WHL rights were acquired from the Prince Albert Raiders on Oct. 21. He had been playing junior A in B.C. since midway through last season.</p>
      <p>“He was great (on Saturday),” Struch said. “When both of your goalies did what they did this weekend (it gives you a chance). Max (Paddock) played three good games for us and Donovan made some big saves early (versus Brandon). The guys got energy and played hard for him.</p>
      <p>“We’ve talked about what kind of group this is. They’re real special people and they’re becoming really good teammates. They want to play hard for each other. They’re starting to become a real good team.”</p>
      <p>The Pats open a four-game Alberta road trip on Wednesday against the Lethbridge Hurricanes.</p>
