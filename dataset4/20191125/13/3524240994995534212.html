      <p>A factory worker, Sunday Usenobong, died from injuries he sustained during an industrial accident while working at the factory of the Landcraft Industry Nigeria Limited at the Odogunyan Industrial Estate in the Ikorodu area of the state.</p>
      <p>Bala Elkana, Police Public Relations Officer, said the 50-year-old fell inside a melting pot, while operating the company’s machine, and died on the spot, adding that homicide detectives, who visited the scene of the accident, evacuated the corpse.</p>
      <p>He said an investigation into the incident was ongoing.</p>
      <p>Elkana stated, “On Friday, November 22, 2019, around 3.30 p.m., one Sunday Usenobong, 50, an employee of the Landcraft Industry Nigeria Limited, Odogunyan Industrial Estate, Ikorodu, allegedly fell inside a melting pot, while operating the company’s machine.</p>
      <p>“Consequently, the victim died on the spot. Homicide detectives visited the scene and the corpse was evacuated to a public morgue for autopsy. An investigation is ongoing.”</p>
      <p>Similarly, one Femi Olatunde, while operating a moulding machine for the Multipak Nigeria Limited, on Plot F28 Kudirat Abiola Way, in the Oregun area of the state, allegedly got trapped in the machine and died on the spot.</p>
      <p>Elkana, who confirmed the incident, said homicide detectives had evacuated the corpse to the mortuary for autopsy, adding that investigation into the case was ongoing.</p>
      <p>He stated, “On Tuesday, November 19, 2019, around 8.20 p.m., a moulding machine operator, one Femi Olatunde, 35, at the Multipak Nigeria Limited, located on Plot F28, Kudirat Abiola Way, Oregun, Lagos State, allegedly got trapped while operating the machine.</p>
      <p>“Consequently, the victim died on the spot. Homicide detectives visited the scene and evacuated the corpse to a public morgue for autopsy. An investigation is ongoing.”</p>
      <p>Reacting to the spate of industrial accidents in the state, the Director General, Lagos State Safety Commission, Lanre Mojola, said in a statement that the state government had declared zero tolerance for factories and private organisations violating safety rules and regulations, adding that it had sealed off Multipak Nigeria Limited.</p>
      <p>According to Mojola, the company’s violation of safety rules and regulations, poor housekeeping and lack of signage led to the untimely death of Olatunde, whose head got stuck while operating one of the machines.</p>
      <p>He stated that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s administration was passionate about the safety of lives and property of the residents.</p>
      <p>“On no account should any factory operate without putting in place safety equipment, quality housekeeping, signage, good wiring system and a clean environment devoid of hazards to the lives of workers and visitors,” Mojola said.</p>
      <p>He urged organisations and individuals to embrace best international safety practices in their operations to prevent fatal incidents that endanger lives, adding that the safety of lives and property was a collective responsibility and warned that factories that violate safety rules would be sanctioned.</p>
