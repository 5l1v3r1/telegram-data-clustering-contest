        <b>Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Novartis announced over the weekend it would dish out $9.7 billion (8.8 billion euros) to acquire US firm Medicines Company, in a move aimed at boosting its cardiovascular treatment portfolio.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Novartis said Sunday it had agreed to pay $85 per Medicines Co. share, which was 41 percent over the US company's closing price on Friday. </p>
      <p>The move will mark the latest in a line of acquisitions aimed at enhancing the Swiss company's stable of cutting-edge drugs to treat things like cancer.  </p>
      <p>In snapping up Medicines Co., the pharma giant said it will lay its hands on a promising cholesterol drug called inclisiran, described by company chief Vas Narasimhan as a "potentially transformational medicine".</p>
      <p>Inclisiran, which recently completed its phase III study, fights "bad" LDL cholesterol in patients with atherosclerosis, or plaque buildup in their arteries.</p>
      <p>The drug, which requires far fewer annual injections than the products currently on the market, is based on RNA interference therapy.</p>
      <p>This is a natural phenomenon used to silence specific genes that produce harmful or diseased proteins, whose discovery in the late 1990s earned Craig Mello and Andrew Fire the 2006 Nobel Medicine Prize.</p>
      <p>Such therapy is increasingly being used for a range of conditions.</p>
      <p>The Medicine Co's drug specifically blocks the liver from making a particular enzyme, PCSK9, which in turn lowers the production of low-density lipoprotein.</p>
      <p>Medicines Co has said it plans to request regulatory approval in the United States by the end of the year, and in Europe in early 2020.</p>
      <p>Overall sales of anti-cholesterol treatments are on average rising 11 percent annually and are expected to reach $17.7 billion by 2024, according to numbers from analysis firm EvaluatePharma.</p>
      <p>High cholesterol is a key factor in coronary artery disease, the most common kind of heart disease and the number one killer of men and women worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.</p>
      <p>If the transaction is completed, inclisiran will be added to Novartis's current cardiovascular products, including its heart-failure treatment Entresto, which saw its sales soar 61 percent year on year to $430 million during the third quarter this year.</p>
      <p>"Novartis has a longstanding history of delivering breakthrough cardiovascular treatments for patients, and I am very excited about the opportunity to add inclisiran to our cardiovascular portfolio," Marie-France Tschudin, president of Novartis Pharmaceutical, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Analysts with Jefferies hailed the move, saying there was a "clear strategic rationale" for the acquisition, and for "bolstering Novartis' cardiovascular franchise, notably leveraging Entresto."</p>
      <p>Novartis said it planned to pay for the acquisition with "available cash and short- and long-term borrowings."</p>
      <p>The acquisition, which still needs a green light from antitrust authorities, is expected to be finalised during the first quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>Following Sunday's announcement, Novartis saw its share price inch 0.4 percent higher to 90.14 Swiss francs ($90.40, 82 euros) a piece in midday trading Monday on the Swiss stock exchange.</p>
