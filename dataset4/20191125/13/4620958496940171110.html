        <i>The Pacific Autism Family Network (PAFN) will host their annual Holiday Luncheon Fundraiser on November 29th at the JW Marriott Parq Vancouver. This is an amazing opportunity to learn about autism, and how Pacific Autism is creating inclusive spaces for people with autism and their families.</i>

      <p>You want the best for your kids. You want them to fit in. You want them to feel good about who they are and most importantly, you want them to feel safe.<br/><br/>Most people can relate.<br/><br/>With 1 in 46 BC kids now living with autism, it’s now the most prevalent childhood disorder in Canada. In fact, it impacts more kids than childhood cancer, diabetes and HIV combined. Unfortunately, autism presents a unique array of challenges and barriers for kids and their families, who simply want the best for their children, just like we all do.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, organizations like <a href="https://adserver.pressboard.ca/c/link?c=236635&amp;w=142785&amp;l=236636">Pacific Autism</a> are working with community partners to create inclusive spaces for people with autism while educating the general public along along the way. Part of this mission includes demystifying and stigmatizing what autism really is.</p>

        <figcaption>PAFN partners with the Whitecaps to provide families with special game access. PAFN provides sensory kits including noise-cancelling headsets and fidget toys and The ‘Caps provide tickets and t-shirts. For some, it’s the first time they’re able to attend a game as a family.</figcaption>

      <p>Autism is a neurological disorder. <br/><br/>It’s not caused by bad parenting and it’s definitely not contagious. The autism spectrum is so wide and varied, that each person on the spectrum is unique with their own unique challenges. Sensory perception challenges can mean lights, noises, smells, tastes or tactile sensations can be mildly irritating to completely painful for some people on the spectrum. Early diagnosis and intervention are critical and therapies can help, but access to each of these is just one barrier many families living with autism face. That’s why Pacific Autism is collaborating with community partners to help connect families with support.</p>
      <p>You can do your part to help that community on November 29th, at Pacific Autism’s third annual <a href="https://adserver.pressboard.ca/c/link?c=236635&amp;w=142785&amp;l=236636">Holiday Luncheon Fundraiser</a>.</p>
      <p>The event raises funds to support thousands of individuals with autism and developmental disorders, along with their families. Last year’s event made a difference in the lives of British Columbians by raising more than $700,000 in the single day. Single tickets are valued at $250 and a Table of 10 is valued at $2,500. You can learn more about the event, or purchase tickets <a href="https://adserver.pressboard.ca/c/link?c=236635&amp;w=142785&amp;l=236636">HERE</a>.</p>
