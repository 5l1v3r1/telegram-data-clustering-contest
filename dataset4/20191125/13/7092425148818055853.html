        <b>Ant and Dec have hit back at claims that a Bushtucker Trial on last night's I'm A Celebrity, involving James Haskell and Roman Kemp, was 'fixed'.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Haskell, 34, and Kemp, 26, had the <a href="https://cms.buzz.ie/news/ant-dec-hit-back-im-celeb-fix-claims-344120"><i>toughest challenge</i></a> and failed to get any of their three stars.</p>
      <p>They were tasked with unscrewing stars from one box before passing them to each other and screwing them back in another one, with each box filled with critters.</p>
      <p>They stumbled at the first hurdle though as they both struggled to get the stars past a bulky crab which was taking up the majority of the space in the box.</p>

      <p>Fans took to Twitter to complain about the task, with many saying it was impossible for them to get the three stars in just 90 seconds.</p>
      <p>One said: "No chance were they ever going to do that last trial in 90 seconds, ridiculous!"</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Sign the petition to get Ian, Cliff and Andy their roast dinners! The last trial was impossible."</p>
      <p>And a third complained: "There was no way anyone on this earth could have completed James and Roman's trial in 90 seconds. Be fair and feed the last three will you? Shouldn't have had less than three minutes on that."</p>
      <p>In response, hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly hit back on Twitter. They wrote:Â "The stand ins did it when we tested it."</p>

      <p>Another fan suggested they shouldn't have started with the crab box, instead going for one with smaller, more mobile creepy crawlies.</p>
      <p>Dec replied, "I agree".</p>
