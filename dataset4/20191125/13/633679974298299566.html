      <p>Singer Billie Eilish is calling out fake fans for booing her as she left a US talk show earlier this month.</p>
      <p>In a video posted online of the "Listen before I go" hitmaker leaving "Jimmy Kimmel Live!", a crowd can be seen booing the 17-year-old, apparently because she did not stop to sign autographs for waiting fans, reports aceshowbiz.com.</p>
      <p>"The only reason I'm making this video is that I saw a video of this all happening and I just wanted to clarify what actually happened...," she says in a post on Instagram.</p>
      <p>She added: "Because if you watch the video it looks like I'm walking by a bunch of fans and completely ignoring them and not saying hi to them, which is not what happened."</p>
      <p>Eilish further claims the people booing were not genuine fans, but professional autograph hunters seeking to make money from her signature.</p>
      <p>"I started to walk away because I realized none of these people actually cared about anything that had to do with me as a person," she added.</p>
      <p>"I walked over there only to say hi, only to hug people and I got pictures of me shoved into my f**king face. I got no love whatsoever, so I left and then I got booed and called a little b**tch and got told I was going to lose my Grammy nominations. The fact that people can switch up like that..."</p>
      <p>She added: "They wait outside for you.. and then immediately they don't get what they want and they boo you and f**king curse at you. I'm like, 'Bro, I'm 17'."</p>
