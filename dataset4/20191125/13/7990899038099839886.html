      <p>We have important news! Baby Yoda GIFs are back on GIPHY after being suddenly removed! The long national nightmare is over after about four days or whatever.</p>
      <p>“Last week, there was some confusion around certain content uploaded to GIPHY and we temporarily removed these GIFs while we reviewed the situation,” a GIPHY spokesperson told Law&amp;Crime in a statement. “We apologize to both Disney and Vulture for any inconvenience, and we are happy to report that the GIFs are once again live on GIPHY.”</p>

      <p>Everything is fixed. The world has no more problems.</p>
      <p>TV critic <b>Kathryn VanArendonk</b>, a writer for Vulture, called attention to the sudden disappearance of Baby Yoda GIFs from GIPHY on Thursday, saying this was “*very* dumb.” This problem was initially believed to have been caused by copyright issues.</p>
      <p>These animated pictures play a role in some reviews for <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/game-of-thrones-series-finale-the-biggest-moments.html">TV series</a> and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/normani-motivation-music-video-best-gifs.html">other pop culture</a> on Vulture. That includes stuff like the new series <i>The Mandalorian</i>, about a bounty hunter in the <i>Star Wars </i>universe protecting a young green alien that belongs to the same species as legendary character Yoda. Fans have taken to calling this adorable small green alien “Baby Yoda.” The lack of GIFs introduced a complication to VanArendonk’s coverage, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/the-mandalorian-baby-yoda-images.html">though she and her colleagues found a workaround</a>.</p>
      <p>But this story is bigger than one TV show. It’s bigger than one website, or one reporter. It’s about everyone joining together for a cause bigger than themselves. And by that, we mean that people made goofy posts about the issue.</p>
