      <h1>3 companies I’m backing for big growth in 2020</h1>

      <p>If there is one investing lesson I would leave to my children it would be this:</p>
      <p>
        <i>Compound. </i>
        <i>Compound. </i>
        <i>Compound.</i>
      </p>
      <p>I am a huge believer in compounding. And the secret to compounding is momentum; the force something has when it is moving. Companies with momentum of revenue growth and free cashflow can grow their competitive advantage and win even more customers.</p>
      <p>As we head into 2020 I’ve been reviewing my portfolio and there are 3 companies that I am backing to continue their strong recent momentum.</p>
      <h3>1. Xero Limited <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-XRO/">(ASX: XRO)</a></h3>
      <p>Accounting platform Xero has continued to post huge numbers in 2019. In the 12 months to September, subscribers grew by 30% to pass the 2 million mark while operating revenue in the first half of the 2020 financial year grew by 32%.</p>
      <p>Xero’s strong operating cash flow is now a lever to both enable reinvestment in the core platform and support marketing to win new customers. I think that bodes well for another year of solid growth in 2020.</p>
      <p>That said, with the Xero share price up almost 90% so far in 2019, I am cautious that there is very little room for error if the company’s main regions (NZ, Australia and the UK) experienced a recession or the momentum unexpectedly slows.</p>
      <h3>2. Pushpay Holdings Ltd <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-PPH/">(ASX: PPH)</a></h3>
      <p>The Pushpay share price has had relatively soft year in 2019, up just 8.25%. However, I think the company is well positioned to keep building on its strong base of customers.</p>
      <p>Revenue grew 30% in the 6 months to September 2019 with a solid increase in processing volumes. But most importantly, gross margins grew and operating cash flow turned positive which enables the company to start funding organic growth in the year ahead.</p>
      <h3>3. A2 Milk Company Ltd <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-A2M/">(ASX: A2M)</a></h3>
      <p>After joining the herd at the a2 Milk <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/20/i-went-to-the-a2-milk-company-agm-heres-what-i-learned/">AGM last week,</a> I am optimistic that a2 Milk can continue growth and strong cashflows in 2020. The $10 billion company announced it expects continued strong revenue growth and upgraded guidance of full year EBITDA margin to 29–30%, from its initial expectations of 28%.</p>
      <h3>Foolish takeaway</h3>
      <p>If these 3 companies can capitalise on their momentum in 2020 (and beyond) they could compound their value significantly in the years to come. Of the 3 companies I think shares in Pushpay and a2 Milk look most compelling today. Still I’m being cautious. With expectations of all 3 companies high, there is certainly risk of big share price falls if the growth fails to materialise.</p>
