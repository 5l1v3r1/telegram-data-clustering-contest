      <p>KOLKATA: The first-ever day-night Test in India was a roaring success, even though it lasted only two days and half a session. Brilliant marketing ensured crowds flocked to the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Eden-Gardens">Eden Gardens</a> to watch India take on Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>India skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> believes that the historic pink-ball Test has shown that if the longest format of the game is marketed properly, then even the conventional day-time Test will generate interest among fans.</p>

      <p>"Marketing Test cricket like T20Is and ODIs is very crucial," Kohli said at the post match press conference. "It's not just about the players, but also the management, cricket board, broadcasters who are responsible for making Test cricket a hot product. The fans need to experience cricket and not just watch it," Kohli observed.</p>
      <p>He suggested ways to make Tests on Indian soil more appealing.</p>
      <p>"If enough buzz is created, then fans will be keen to come to the ground. I am a big fan of having interactive sessions with fans, like it happens abroadâ€¦ Maybe school children can interact with the players during lunch," Kohli proposed.</p>

      <p>Asked about his pacers, who bagged all 19 Bangladesh wickets (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mahmudullah">Mahmudullah</a> retired hurt in the second innings) in the match, Kohli said: "They (Mohammad Shami, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/umesh-yadav">Umesh Yadav</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ishant-sharma">Ishant Sharma</a>) are enjoying hunting as a pack. They have gained a lot of experience over the years and are lethal even on home turf."</p>
      <p>The fast bowlers, Kohli added, "take ownership of their training and fitness, and have good communication with the Board. If someone has a workload issue, we give him a break so that they return refreshed."</p>

      <p>On the chances of India playing a pink ball Test in Australia when they travel Down Under next year, Kohli laid out the conditions. "Bangladesh came in without any match practice. We had the advantage because it was our home conditions. Maybe when we play abroad, we will find it more challenging. So a practice game before that is a must. You can't play it (day-night Test) on a short notice," Kohli articulated.</p>
      <p>Kohli was glad to be on the same page as new BCCI president <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sourav-Ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a>. "Dada was very open and welcoming in understanding what the team thinks about playing with pink ball and it was in sync with his thoughts," he remarked.</p>

      <p>Team India have now won seven Test matches on the trot, but Kohli was not ready to rate themselves in the same league as the West Indies team of the 1970s. "I can say that we are at the top of our game, but the West Indies team dominated world cricket for 15 years," he pointed out.</p>
      <p>Kohli backed the tormented Bangladesh team, saying that they need to gain more experience to do well in Test cricket. "They are a young side and came into this series without their most experienced players <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Tamim-Iqbal">Tamim Iqbal</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shakib-Al-Hasan">Shakib Al Hasan</a>. Playing two Test matches after a year and half will not help them learn," he said.</p>
