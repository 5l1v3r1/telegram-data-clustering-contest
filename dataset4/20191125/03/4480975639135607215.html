      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T03:27:52+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 03:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/omkar-godbole" target="_blank">Omkar Godbole</a></address>
      <p>Gold's ongoing consolidation between the 100- and 50-day moving averages is healthy, as it will ease some of the persistent concerns on positioning and create room for further gains, according to UBS analysts. </p>
      <h3>Key points</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Gold traders should watch out for the US economic data, the US-China trade-related newsflow and the resulting impact on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. </li>
        <li>Uncertainty is likely to persist, forcing the central banks to keep rates low. </li>
        <li>Gold can trade through $1,600 in 2020 and $1,550 over the next three months. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The yellow metal is currently trading at $1,460, representing nearly 14% gains on a year-to-date basis, having hit a high of $1,557 on Sept. 4.<br/> </p>
