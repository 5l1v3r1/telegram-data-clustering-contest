      <h1>Go short EUR/GBP amid Brexit hopes, effective UK’s fiscal policy – Goldman Sachs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T03:10:45+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 03:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>In their latest client note, analysts at Goldman Sachs recommend going short on the EUR/GBP cross amid increased expectations of the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/events/brexit">Brexit</a> resolution.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>“Go short EUR/GBP with target 0.82 and stop at 0.88.</p>
      <p>Reasons -</p>
      <p>Progress towards Brexit resolution.</p>
      <p>Higher degree of confidence on the UK's fiscal policy than almost anywhere else.</p>
      <p>Both major parties are effectively committed to higher government spending.</p>
      <p>However, near-term risk is a hung Parliament which would extend the Brexit uncertainty further and may even prompt BoE rate cuts ahead.”</p>
