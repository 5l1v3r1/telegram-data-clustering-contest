      <h1>ASIC launches investigation into Westpac</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T03:58:24+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 03:58</time> by <a rel="author">Clancy Yeates</a></address>
      <p>The corporate watchdog has launched an investigation into Westpac over potential legal breaches linked to the bank's money laundering compliance scandal, ahead of a series of critical meetings between chairman Lindsay Maxsted and investors.</p>
      <p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on Monday took the unusual step of publicly confirming it had started looking into possible breaches of laws it administers — most likely a reference to the Corporations Act.</p>

      <p>The fresh investigation is the latest blow to the bank, after it was last week thrown into crisis by a regulatory lawsuit that says it breached anti-money laundering laws 23 million times, including failing to adequately vet thousands of payments potentially linked to child exploitation.</p>
      <p>"ASIC can confirm that it commenced an investigation on Thursday, 21 November 2019 concerning possible breaches of legislation it administers arising from AUSTRAC’s actions in relation to Westpac," a spokesman said on Monday.</p>
      <p>ASIC did not provide further details of its investigation into Westpac. But the <i>Australian Financial Review</i> last week reported that the watchdog could look at a Corporations Act duty to act "efficiently, honestly and fairly," and a duty to take the care and diligence expected of a reasonable person.</p>
      <p>A bank spokesman said: "Westpac will co-operate with any regulatory inquiries.”</p>

      <p>ASIC also launched an investigation into the Commonwealth Bank after it was hit by an anti-money laundering lawsuit more than two years ago. The ASIC spokesman on Monday said this CBA probe was ongoing.</p>
      <p>As Westpac shares continued to slide, falling 1.3 per cent to $24.43, credit ratings Moody's on Monday also warned the alleged money laundering breaches would be "credit negative" for the bank.</p>
      <p>Moody's highlighted the high cost of fines for breaches of anti-money laundering laws, though it added that if Westpac got a fine as large as Commonwealth Bank's record $700 million penalty for anti-money laundering breaches, this would be "manageable" for the bank.</p>
      <p>Confirmation of the ASIC investigation, a day after the <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53djf.html">Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)</a> said it too was investigating the bank, comes as chairman Lindsay Maxsted will meet with key advisers and investors this week.</p>
      <p>The meetings could be crucial in determining the futures of Mr Maxsted and the bank's chief executive Brian Hartzer, as politicians and investors demand accountability over the scandal.</p>
      <p>The meetings will include governance adviser Institutional Shareholder Services, superannuation giant AustralianSuper, and various other big investors in the bank and proxy advisers.</p>
      <p>Amid predictions from some investors and business commentators that Mr Hartzer will likely lose his job over the scandal, <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53dky.html">Mr Maxsted on Sunday strongly backed the CEO</a>, saying the board had seen no evidence of failure by Mr Hartzer.</p>
