      <p>Speaking during GSM Home’s opening ceremony in Dar es Salaam on Friday, the group’s Managing Director, Fatma Abdallah said the objective of the mega furniture mall investment is to address existing demand in the market.</p>
      <p>“This new shop is tailored to cater for Tanzanians from all walks of life because it has everything for everyone in as far as furniture needs are concerned. We have a range of home and office furniture meeting international standards at GSM Home,” Abdallah said.</p>
      <p>She named some of the furniture available at the shop as sofa sets, wall fitted wardrobes, coffee tables, dining tables, beds and bedroom material and many others. “I would like to welcome all Tanzanians to come and sample our world class furniture selling at local prices,” she said while saying some of the brands selling at the shop come from Italy. The GSM Group chief announced a 10 percent discount for purchases totalling 200,000/-.</p>
      <p>In his inaugural address of the mall, Silent Ocean owner and CEO, Salaa Mohamed commended GSM for coming up with the furniture mega mall saying products being sold by the outlet are what many consumers would prefer to buy.</p>
      <p>Mohamed paid tribute to GSM Group’s management and staff for the continued investment and creativity in diversifying their business hence allowing consumers to have a variety of world class furniture and other products.</p>
      <p>“I urge Tanzanians to come and visit this modern shop and buy merchandise of their choice at affordable prices as per their budgets. I also congratulate GSM management for continuing to be innovative in coming up with the idea of investing in this mega furniture mall which allows local consumers easy access to such products,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said the group’s massive investments in the country have provided employment to thousands of Tanzanians both directly and indirectly which has enabled them to have a reliable source of income to support their families.</p>
      <p>“GSM Group of companies have been an important stakeholder to the growth of the country’s economy but we also expect you to contribute even more in implementing government’s industrialization drive as we head towards middle income status by 2025,” the Silent Ocean Limited’s CEO added.</p>
