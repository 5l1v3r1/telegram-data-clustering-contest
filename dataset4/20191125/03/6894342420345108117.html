      <h1>Waze Now Displays Estimated Toll Prices To Your Destination</h1>

      <p>Waze has been providing users with navigation routes, which may include tolls for a quicker route. Recently, the app has been updated to display toll prices in Malaysia, allowing users to compare them between routes.</p>
      <p>The toll prices display feature is now live for both Android and iOS device. As we checked, the feature does work for most tolls, including the North-South Expressway. However, there are still some tolls that still don’t have prices displayed yet. For example, the Kajang station on the North-South Expressway, from Mid Valley City to KLIA.</p>

      <p>That said, Waze utilises community feedback and map editors to bring information to other users. We can most likely be able to see all the tolls fully supported as map editors continue to add toll information into the app.</p>

      <p>As for now, drivers can now get an estimation of toll charges to their destination to prepare credits for their <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/197884/plus-no-more-touch-n-go-reload-services-at-toll-plaza-exits-after-5-november/">Touch n’ Go</a> card. On the other hand, this feature is not exactly new from Waze as it was first implemented in the US and Canada back in July this year.</p>
