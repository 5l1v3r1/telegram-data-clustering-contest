      <p>Kilimanjaro Queens had to wait deep into injury time to conquer a fast improving Uganda side, posting 1-0 victory over the latter at the venue.</p>
      <p>Kenya humiliated Burundi 5-0 in a one-sided encounter played at the venue earlier the same day.</p>
      <p>The two sides meet for the second time in the final and third time overall. The two drew 1-1 in CECAFA 2018, while Tanzania won 2-1 courtesy of a Mwanahamisi Omary brace the last time these two met in the tournament final.</p>
      <p>There was also one-all draw in the group stage finals of the event’s 2016 edition in Uganda.</p>
      <p>There is little to separate the two teams. Both are yet to concede and have had a perfect run to the final.</p>
      <p>Tanzania are ranked 19th in Africa and 137th worldwide according to the FIFA women’s rankings for September. Kenya are placed 21st in the continent and 143rd globally.</p>
      <p>Kilimanjaro Queens certainly did not have things all their own way in the thrilling semi-final win over Uganda, but the important thing was the results.</p>
      <p>They have won all of their matches, and must fancy their chances of a third consecutive title.</p>
      <p>Due to experience, Kilimanjaro Queens came into the tournament as most people’s pick and they are the slight favourites to beat a youthful Kenya squad.</p>
      <p>Kilimanjaro Queens head coach, Bakari Shime, will bank on the experience of the true and tested captain, Asha Rashid, Mwanahamisi Omari ‘Gaucho’, Stumai Abdallah and Donisia Minja, who were crucial in the back-to-back title campaigns in Burundi and Rwanda.</p>
      <p>The hosts, obviously, have plenty of firepower of their own, the quartet of Asha, Mwanahamisi, Stumai and Donisia have all together scored 15 goals which means Kilimanjaro Queens are not reliant on a single individual for goals.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Harambee Starlets scored 17 goals in Group B to cruise past Uganda, Ethiopia and Djibouti, with the latter losing 12-0 to the group leaders.</p>
      <p>The semi-final thrashing of Burundi stretched Harambee Starlets’ goal tally to 22, a fact that proves their ruthless streak, if needed proving at all.</p>
      <p>They will be spearheaded by 17-year-old Jentrix Shikangwa who leads the top-scorers' charts with nine goals, having scored in every match so far in her CECAFA Senior Women Challenge Cup debut.</p>
      <p>This is going to be a tough game for both sides, but one-day rest from the semi-finals could have an impact on the overall quality of the match.</p>
