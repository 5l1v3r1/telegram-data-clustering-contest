      <h4>Camila Cabello stole the show when she arrived on the red carpet at the 2019 American Music Awards in this stunning gown &amp; then hit the stage in a sexy seer bodysuit for a showstopping performance.</h4>
      <p><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/tag/camila-cabello"><b>Camila Cabello</b></a>, 22, looked gorgeous at the 2019 <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/tag/amas">American Music Awards</a> in LA on November 24. The singer arrived looking like a fairy princess in a strapless sheer nude <b>Oscar de la Renta Spring-Summer 2020 Cocktail Dress</b> with a corset bodice that showed off her insanely tiny waist and toned abs. The corset was covered in intricate floral applique while the bottom half of the dress was made of chiffon ruffle tiers.</p>
      <p>The skirt of her dress was short in the front and long in the back, while put her long, toned legs on full display. The back of her princess gown featured a long flowy train that was also covered in floral embroidery and she topped her look off with a pair of metallic gold platform ankle-strap sandals. The best part of Camila’s ensemble was her gorgeous long braid which ended all the way at her waist, while her bangs were tousled and wavy, covering her forehead.</p>
      <p>After the red carpet, Camila hit the stage for an amazing performance of her hit new song, “Living Proof,” and she looked gorgeous in a sheer white lace corse bodysuit with a high-waisted white chiffon maxi skirt.</p>
