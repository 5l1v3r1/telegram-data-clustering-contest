      <p>The dreaded Freudian slip. It has gotten the best of us, but I’m sure Mason Rudolph would like a do-over on this interview.</p>
      <p>Following the Steelers win over the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday, the benched QB finally got his opportunity to respond to Myles Garrett claims that he used a racial slur that caused the brawl during the Browns-Steelers game last Thursday.</p>
      <p>In his attempt to state how wrong Garrett was, Rudolph almost stated it was “totally true” before catching himself and stating it was untrue.</p>

      <p>The NFL has already came out and cleared Rudolph of that claim, as they had nobody mic’d up during the game and no audio on the field at the time.</p>
      <p>Garrett continues to stick by his claim as he gets set to sit for the remainder of the 2019 season.</p>
