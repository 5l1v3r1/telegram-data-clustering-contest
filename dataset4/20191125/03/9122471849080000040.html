      <p>No. 2 Ohio State remained undefeated with a win over now-No. 12 Penn State in Columbus on Saturday afternoon. The Buckeyes held off the Nittany Lions, 28-17, to move to 11-0 on the year.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes went up big early and avoided a disastrous collapse in the second half. Ohio State turned the ball over multiple times in the game’s final two quarters, allowing James Franklin’s team to score 17 unanswered points and cut the lead to four.</p>
      <p>Penn State started to feel itself a bit in that second half.</p>
      <p>Nittany Lions star Lamont Wade had a viral celebration on the bench during the near-comeback:</p>
