      <p>Kelsea Balllerini sparkled on the red carpet at the AMAs.</p>
      <p>Kelsea Ballerini stood out as she walked the red carpet at the 2019 <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/american-music-awards/">American Music Awards</a> held at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles. The country star scrapped wearing a dress and instead chose a fun pantsuit that has everyone talking.</p>
      <p>The “Peter Pan” singer knows just how to gain some attention. She looked stylish and chic wearing a red pantsuit with waves of wide silver stripes throughout, as seen in photos by <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/24/kelsea-ballerini-amas-2019-outfit-photos/"><i>Hollywood Life</i></a>. The whole outfit was full of glitter and sparkle. The jacket was the main eye-catcher, as Kelsea seemed to have left her top at home. Instead, she threw on her jacket and left the front half open baring part of her chest right down to her flat belly. The jacket was likely held in place by tape, in hopes of avoiding any type of wardrobe malfunction.</p>
      <p>The high-waisted pants featured a thick band of silver wrapped around Kelsea’s thin frame, but otherwise matched perfectly with the jacket. It was a daring look for the 26-year-old musician, but it seemed to work for her. She paired the ensemble with silver pointed shoes and a chain necklace to complete the outfit.</p>
      <p>Her makeup consisted of lilac eyeshadow, black mascara, and light pink lip color. Her long blond locks were worn in a straight, sleek style that was perfect with the pantsuit.</p>

      <p>Kelsea took to her Instagram stories right before she walked the red carpet to let her followers take a sneak peek at her outfit. She also took a short video of the colorful chaos she caused as she was riding to the American Music Awards. The sparkling pantsuit sent out a display of red on the roof of the car, which led to her calling herself a disco ball as laughter rang out in the background.</p>

      <p>It was announced earlier in the month that Kelsea is up for a nomination for Favorite Female Country Artist this year at the AMAs, as previously reported by <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5730576/american-music-awards-taylor-swift-lizzo-billie-eilish/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a>. She is up against fellow country stars Carrie Underwood and Maren Morris.</p>
      <p>Kelsea also met up with Taylor Swift at the event. They were seen giving each other a hug and chatting it up a bit. She also grabbed a hug from pop star Camila Cabello on the red carpet.</p>
      <p>Just a few days ago, Kelsea Ballerini performed her new hit “Homecoming Queen?” at the 2019 Country Music Awards. It was an emotionally-packed performance and even got a shoutout from this year’s Entertainer of the Year winner, Garth Brooks.</p>
