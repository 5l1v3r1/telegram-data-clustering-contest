      <p>Nov. 24 (UPI) -- Romanian President Klaus Iohannis won a second term in a landslide victory Sunday over former Prime Minister Viorica Dancila in the runoff election.</p>
      <p>The pro-Europe center-right president won around 63 percent of the vote in the runoff election to Dancila, who garnered 33.5 percent of ballots cast, according to <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/romania-iohannis-dancila-presidential-election-runoff/30288488.html">exit polls</a>.</p>
      <p>"After this victory, there are many things to do, to repair," the former physics teacher said in his <a href="https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-presidential-elections-exit-polls">victory speech.</a> "I will get involved in creating a new majority, made of the democratic parties, which will lead Romania towards modernization, Europeanization."</p>
      <p>Iohannis, 60, said he will be "a president fully involved for Romina."</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-presidential-elections-2019-second-round-turnout">Central Election Commission</a>, about 50 percent or 9 million of Romania's 18.2 million registered voters and a record 940,000 Romanians abroad cast ballots in the second round of the election that started Nov. 22.</p>
      <p>Iohannis' election is <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/romania-iohannis-dancila-presidential-election-runoff/30288488.html">largely seen</a> as a rebuke of the ruling Social Democratic Party, which has gone through a succession of prime ministers, including Dancila who was recently deposed, as the party weakened anti-corruption laws and threatened the independence of the courts in the former communist nation.</p>
      <p>"Congratulations, Klaus Iohannis, with your victory in the presidential elections today," said <a href="https://twitter.com/ManfredWeber/status/1198692691237900297">Manfred Weber</a>, chairman of the center-right European People's Party group in the European Parliament. "Romania once again shows its attachment to European values."</p>
