          <b>**Warning, major spoilers from Watchmen episode 6 ahead!**</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>Watchmen just blew us out the water with its sixth episode This Extraordinary Being by finally confirming that Hooded Justice is Will Reeves.</p>
      <p>It had been strongly hinted at throughout the HBO series that Angela Abar’s grandfather was the ex-vigilante up until this point, but the hour-long feature delved right into why and how the character became the crime-stopping vigilante.</p>
      <p>Oh, and on top of the colossal reveal, audiences also got confirmation that Will did actually kill Detective Judd Crawford (Don Johnson) with a throwback clip showing how the crime was committed.</p>

      <p>But what’s the significance of Will being Hooded Justice?</p>
      <p>Well, in Alan Moore’s comics the character was said to be Rolf Muller, a circus strongman from East Germany who was also a serial killer, however, this was reworked in the subsequent prequel, Before Watchmen #6, where it was heavily suggested that Rolf’s son was Hooded Justice.</p>

      <p>Now we know this definitely isn’t the case.</p>
      <p>In the latest episode, Anglea made the discovery that her grandad is Hooded Justice after swallowing a lethal dose of nostalgia pills.</p>
      <p>Journeying back through Will’s past, she relived his experiences as she followed him as he landed a job working with the police.</p>
      <p>Early on in his career, she saw that Will was attacked by three colleagues after he pressed them for details on the racist mob Cyclops.</p>

      <p>The clan pinned Will down, tied a rope around his neck and proceeded to lynch him on the branch of an oak tree, but brought him back down to safety with seconds to spare, threatening to kill him for good should he continue to try and pester them for information.</p>
      <p>From that moment, Will decided to fight crime wearing a mask and noose tied around his neck and continued his mission of unearthing the Cyclops along wit the Minutemen.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere in the spectacular episode, Watchmen also revealed Hooded Justice’s relationship with Captain Metropolis (Chris Whitley), as well as showing us how he, a disabled elderly gentleman, managed to kill Judd.</p>
      <p>HJ used mind control, which was used by the Cyclops to create mass destruction between the black community, to overthrow Judd and order him to hang himself.</p>
      <p>Yep, we didn’t see any of that coming. Roll on episode seven!</p>
