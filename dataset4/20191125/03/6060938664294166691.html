      <p>KOLKATA: When India skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> sought out <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sachin-Tendulkar">Sachin Tendulkar</a> on Friday evening, the legend suggested that the second session of a pink-ball contest should be treated like the morning of a day-time Test.</p>
      <p>"When it starts getting darker, the ball starts to swing and seam," Kohli said after India's innings-and-46-run victory over Bangladesh on Sunday. "So in the first session you invariably play like from lunch to tea in a normal-time Test. The second session would be like the morning session and the last one would be like the evening."</p>
      <p>These changes result in reworking the strategies too. "The planning changes, so does the declaration strategy and timing," the skipper explained. "As a batsman, your setup changes. Even if you are set and batting well, you can be in trouble as soon as it gets dark and lights come on."</p>
      <p>Kohli, however, did not seem to be in any trouble during his innings of 136. Clearly, he had taken Tendulkar's suggestion to heart and planned that way.</p>

      <p>Kohli felt he was lucky that he went in to bat when the lights were already glowing. "I went in when lights were on, so I didn't have to go through that transition, but that will be another challenge in future," he said. He did admit that the afternoon session was relatively easy.</p>
      <p>On the personal front, it was a different experience for Kohli. "When I walked out, it felt like an IPL game atmosphere so you think 'let's smash the first ball'. But you have to remind yourself that you have to play compact, also because the ball was coming faster off the pitch."</p>
      <p>Analysing the pink ball's behavour, the skipper said it seamed a lot under lights. "It swung in the first hour of second session but seamed throughout evening till the end of day's play."</p>
