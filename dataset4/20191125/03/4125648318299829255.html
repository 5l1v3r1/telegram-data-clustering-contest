      <p>The rallies in Lebanon have been underway since October, sparked by the authorities’ plan to introduce a tax on online calls made via the WhatsApp messenger, which was subsequently scrapped.</p>
      <p>However, the protests evolved into calls to end corruption and mismanagement by the political elite. The riots saw Prime Minister Saad Hariri resign on 29 October.</p>
