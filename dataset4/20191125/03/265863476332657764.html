      <h1>Frozen II’s Opening Weekend Scores $127 Million Making It The Highest Earning Animated Movie</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T03:11:21+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 03:11</time> by <a rel="author">Bridget Hill</a></address>
      <p>According to a report from BusinessInsider.com, Disney’s new film, <i>Frozen II</i>, performed just as well as the studios had hoped. Earlier this week, Disney scored a big win with <i>Ford Versus Ferrari</i> following their purchase of the 20th Century Fox studio.</p>
      <p>After the movie’s success, the filmmaking juggernauts witnessed the box office smasher,<i> Frozen II.</i> Reportedly, the sequel to the original 2013 film earned around $127 million at the box office in Canada and in the United States.</p>
      <p>Reportedly, it makes <i>Frozen II</i> the highest-earning animated movie ever for the month of November. Moreover, Frozen II was a breath of fresh air for the movie business, following the failure of <i>Charlie’s Angels, Doctor Sleep,</i> as well as <i>Terminator: Dark Fate.</i></p>
      <p>The original Frozen earned around $93 million on Thanksgiving weekend in 2013. The sequel brought in $100 around the world on Friday, which isn’t a surprise, considering the first film won Oscars and fans of the franchise have been patiently waiting for the newest installment.</p>

      <p>Around the world, Frozen II was number one in nearly every part of the globe and even broke records. For instance, it was the highest-earning animated movie ever in the United Kingdom as well as in France. In China, the movie was the third-highest opening for a cartoon film.</p>
      <p>Taking into account all of the box offices around the world, <i>Frozen II</i> earned a whopping $350 million. Some of the other top-earners this past weekend include Matt Damon and Christian Bale’s critically acclaimed movie, Ford Versus Ferrari.</p>
      <p>Despite the success of <i>Frozen II,</i> the movie business is reportedly in peril, considering the total revenue generated thus far this year is down by nearly 10%. Charlie’s Angels, perhaps one of the biggest financial disappointments thus far this year, dropped 62% in its second weekend and earned only $3.1 million.</p>
      <p>Lionsgate’s <i>Knives Out</i> earned just $2 million at early showings, however, the film will screen on more theaters on Wednesday. This year, there’s no question that Disney has dominated the box office, with films like <i>The Avengers, Frozen II, Lion King</i>, and <i>Aladdin.</i></p>
