      <h1>Thailand’s Pavit steals dramatic four-way playoff in Malaysia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T03:02:16+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 03:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/AFP" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Pavit Tangkamolprasert chipped-in for birdie on the second play-off hole Sunday to clinch the Sabah Masters for his second Asian Tour title.</p>
      <p>After closing with a final round 65, Pavit — who suffered a play-off defeat at the recent Thailand Open — redeemed himself in a four-way battle against compatriot Phachara Khongwatmai, Australian David Gleeson and Aman Raj of India.</p>
      <p>Pavit, 30, told reporters it had been an “unbelievable week.”</p>
      <p>“It is the best chip in my life,” he said of his hole out.</p>
      <p>Gleeson, who led after three rounds, could have wrapped up the tournament on the 72nd hole, but a costly bogey gave him a three-under 68.</p>
      <p>Phachara shot a final round 67 and Raj a blistering 63, with all the play-off contenders ending regulation play on matching totals of 13-under-par 271.</p>
      <p>In the first play-off hole — which was held on the par-four 18th — Raj bowed out with a bogey.</p>
