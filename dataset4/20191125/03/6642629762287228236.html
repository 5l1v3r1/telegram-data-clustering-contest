      <p>Philippine troops on Monday rescued a British man and his Filipino wife who were abducted from a southern beach resort last month by gunmen linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/isis-isil.html">ISIL</a> or ISIS) and taken to their jungle hideouts. </p>
      <p>Regional military commander Lt Gen Cirilito Sobejana said troops caught up with the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/abu-sayyaf.html">Abu Sayyaf</a> captors of Allan Hyrons and his wife, Wilma, in the mountainous hinterlands of Parang town in Sulu province and rescued the couple after a fight.</p>
      <p>“There was a running gun battle," Sobejana said. "They left the two behind because they could not drag them any more. They scampered in different directions but our troops are in pursuit.” </p>
      <p>The Hyrons were not hurt in the 10-minute exchange of fire, the military said, adding that no ransom had been paid to the group.</p>
      <p>A picture released by the military showed the couple smiling in a military camp and talking with generals and other army officers in Sulu.</p>
      <p>Sobejana said the couple will undergo a medical checkup and be interviewed by military officials.</p>
      <p>Gunmen abducted the couple last month as some villagers watched in shock from their beach resort in southern Zamboanga del Norte province, sparking a massive search.</p>
      <p>The couple also owned a college in Zamboanga del Norte’s Tukuran town, where they had lived for many years.</p>
      <h3>Military successes</h3>
      <p>Military offensives against ransom-seeking groups such as the Abu Sayyaf have reduced abductions in recent years.</p>
      <p>Sobejana confirmed that three Indonesian fishermen abducted recently off Malaysia’s Sabah state near the sea border with the southern Philippines were in the hands of Abu Sayyaf fighters in Sulu.</p>

      <p>Abu Sayyaf gunmen have staged kidnappings in and off Sabah in the past, sparking a regional security alarm.</p>
      <p>The rescue of the Hyrons came after the military inflicted successive defeats on the Abu Sayyaf, which is listed as a "terrorist" organisation by the United States and the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/philippines.html">Philippines</a>.</p>
      <p>On Friday, they killed a “high-value” but little-known Abu Sayyaf commander, Talha Jumsah who was said to have acted as a key link between ISIL and local fighters. </p>
      <p>On Sunday, troops killed five fighters, including two commanders, one of whom had been blamed for past ransom kidnappings.</p>
      <p>The Abu Sayyaf emerged in the late 1980s as an offshoot of the decades-long Muslim separatist armed uprising in the south of the largely Roman Catholic nation.</p>
      <p>After losing its commanders early in battle the Abu Sayyaf rapidly degenerated into a small but brutal group blamed for ransom kidnappings, beheadings and other acts of banditry.</p>
      <p>Most of its factions have pledged allegiance to ISIL.</p>
