      <p>Manjot Kaur, an acclaimed contemporary artist from <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a>, who is also a school teacher, tells <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a> about the trials and tribulations of teaching art.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Can art really be taught?</b>
      </p>
      <p>To be honest, I am not sure. I believe art as a subject is an essential part of the curriculum, just as other co-curricular like dance, music and sports. It is crucial to teach these subjects to our students. It enriches their minds, opens them up, before they get into learning high concepts of math and physics or any other such subject.</p>
      <p>However, I believe one cannot really teach someone to be a good artist. Of course, everyday practice will help you imbibe art to some extent, but one has to be born with it. It is either an inherited talent, or you are somehow specially chosen to possess that talent.</p>
      <p>It is hard to teach someone who has no gift for art, to be a good artist.</p>
      <p>
        <b>If art is an inherent talent, then is an art teacher redundant?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Even if everyone cannot be a good artist, does not mean they should not practice art. It is important, especially at a young age, to participate in creative activities. The issue with our curriculum is that we do not have a robust primary education system. If children are exposed to all these subjects at a primary level and taught well, and then allowed to choose what they want to pursue, they will always do well. Now, there is one class teacher that teaches them all the subjects at the primary level, so it is impossible for them to have a thorough preliminary knowledge of all subjects. Only when they grow older, do we introduce art as a separate subject and introduce them to more number of art classes. This is not a sustainable way to introduce the subject.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What is your experience of teaching art at government schools?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The biggest problem is the lack of infrastructure and the fact that they do not take co curricular teachers seriously. There is no separate art room, not enough supplies, nor are there separates sports facilities or a music or dance studio. We cannot provide a serious education without these facilities. Worst of all, they do not treat art teachers with respect, nor are they adequately staffed. There are only two art teachers in my school.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why do you think art teachers are not treated with the respect they deserve?</b>
      </p>
      <p>They just seem to treat me as someone fulfilling a formality rather than a faculty member with real potential. I think some of them do not treat the subject seriously, which also makes the student believe that it is not to be taken seriously. So not only does the administration and other teaching staff treat us badly, students also start disrespecting and undermining the authority of art teachers. Further, because we do not have such a regimented syllabus, and there are no examinations, they believe we are just here to pass time rather than teach anything seriously.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Would you suggest art examinations to make students take the subject seriously?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Actually no, I do not think that is a good idea either. Art cannot be enforced like that, it will just take the joy and creativity out of the subject if we do so. Often when art teachers are saddled with logistical work like that, they lose out on their potential for creative work. It dulls their flare and in turn that of their students. So that is not at all ideal. We can encourage art without making it such a serious, examination heavy subject.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How do you inculcate an artistic flair in you students?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I believe children possess the flair themselves, I just need to be there to guide them when they need me. Most of the students at our school come from underprivileged backgrounds and subjects like art are not encouraged in many such households because the parents just do not have the time. But, there is a raw talent in these children, some of them already paint better than I did when I was at college. So there are always ten such students in a batch who are highly talented. These students often go on to do well and many of these children have won accolades.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Is this flair retained as the children grow older?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Many children leave it behind and concentrate on the so-called mainstream subjects. But there are others who sustain their passion. Only recently, a student from the tenth grade approached me about participating in an art contest, and I had never even taught him before. We made all the supplies available, I guided him and he did so well. You never know where talent can suddenly manifest.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What can be done to improve the ways in which art is taught in schools?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Beyond providing infrastructure and making sure that there are adequate number of teachers for each subject, school administration should support their teachers to flourish and do well in their fields.</p>
      <p>More often than not, I myself have been let down by such authority and have felt like not teaching any more. I have won many accolades, I am active in the art scene here in Chandigarh and even globally.</p>
      <p>There is much that the students can learn from me if I am supported by the school and valued for my talent and efforts. This year, I went for an esteemed art residency in Italy for which I had to miss school for a few months. But instead of working with me to figure out how to teach the students in my absence, the school initiated an inquiry against me. How do they expect the students to be enthusiastic about learning art if I am low on morale.</p>
