        <b>Tanzania has a fullback problem. It has caused them problems in recent matches, even though senior national soccer team, Taifa Stars, head coach, Etienne Ndayiragije, has fielded different players for that position in every match.</b>

      <p>The issue has not showed signs of improving either.</p>
      <p>For many years, Shomari Kapombe was the default Taifa Stars right full back but, since his injuries' problems began in 2016, he has hardly played for both club and country.</p>
      <p>Even when he seems fit this season, it is clear injuries have taken a toll on his performances.</p>
      <p>Since joining Simba from Azam FC, Kapombe has missed 73 games due to injury.</p>
      <p>At only 27 years of age when he is supposed to be at his prime, Kapombe has announced his retirement from international football.<br/>Injuries have forced him to concentrate on club football in order to sustain his career.</p>
      <p>Kapombe’s retirement has left Hassan Ramadhan ‘Kessy’ as the default number one Taifa Stars' full back.</p>
      <p>Kessy is not exactly young and his experience should have meant smooth transition. However, that is not the case.</p>
      <p>In the three matches he has played under Etienne Ndayiragije, Kessy has taken criticism from many corners and the reasons are obvious.</p>
      <p>Kessy was at fault for helping Libya notch an equaliser in Taifa Stars’ defeat to the Libyans in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations' qualifiers' clach in Tunisia on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>He is known to be a full-back who likes to attack and bomb forward. For all his qualities going forward, Kessy can hardly defend.</p>
      <p>Against Libya, he was brought on in the second half to help shore the right channel in which Salum Kimenya was constantly exposed by the hosts.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, it was lack of tackling that led to Libya advance into the box, resulting in an awkward clearance by center back Bakari Mwamnyeto that was harshly judged to be a penalty by the central referee from Malawi.</p>
      <p>In the nine matches since he took over, Ndayiragije has used five different right full-backs in what he acknowledges as a problem in his squad.</p>
      <p>In his first two matches in charge, which were against Kenya’s Harambee Stars in the 2020 Africa Nations Championship (CHAN) qualifiers, Ndayiragije used Paul Godfrey ‘Boxer’.</p>
      <p>The young right full back from Yanga did not have an overall bad game but he could not get the better of the muscular Kenyans.</p>
      <p>While Godfrey’s faithfuls sing that he is a modern-day full-back, who can also play as a wing-back if the need ever arises, he was easily disposed of the ball in the two matches against Kenya. However, he should be credited for attempting going forward.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Godfrey’s national audition was cut short by an injury he picked while playing for Yanga, forcing Ndayiragije to try Haruna Shamte of Simba in the 2022 World Cup qualifier first leg match against Burundi.</p>
      <p>Shamte had a torrid game and was turned in and out by the Burundi wingers a couple of times.</p>
      <p>It was clear he was not the ideal replacement for Kapombe. Kessy was brought in for the return leg in Dar es Salaam.</p>
      <p>It was time to try out KMC FC’s Boniface Maganga against Sudan in the first leg of the 2020 CHAN second round qualifier played in Dar es Salaam.</p>
      <p>Like Shamte, Maganga turned out to be a weak link which was dully exposed by the visitors to condemn Ndayiragije to his first loss as Taifa Stars’ head coach.</p>
