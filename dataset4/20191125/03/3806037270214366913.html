      <h1>New 'Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker' TV Spot Offers First Live Look at the Knights of Ren</h1>
      <h2>Along with a possible hint for a tie-in with ‘The Mandalorian.’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T03:57:28+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 03:57</time> by <a rel="author">Sophie Caraan</a></address>
      <p>A new television spot for <i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker">Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker</a></i> has finally given fans a first live-action look at the Knights of Ren.</p>
      <p>Dressed in rusty all-black armor, the mysterious group is shown standing atop a mountain, seemingly surveying their surroundings for possible enemies. Each one of the Knights sport a mask similar to Kylo Ren, but helm varying weapons that range for both close-range or long range combat.</p>
      <p>Not a lot is actually known about the Knights of Ren but their organization has been teased since Rey’s visions in <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/star-wars-the-force-awakens"><i>The Force Awakens</i></a>. As established in the new trilogy, the six elite warriors are followers of the Dark Side but are neither Sith nor Jedi, and filled the void left behind by Darth Vader and Darth Sidious. Kylo Ren serves as their master as he’s the archetype of the new generation of Force-users, however the Knights of Ren’s true allegiance and loyalty to the First Order remains unclear.</p>
      <p>The Knights of Ren’s whereabouts during <i>The Force Awakens</i> and <i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/star-wars-the-last-jedi">The Last Jedi</a></i> are still under wraps, although many fans presume they’ve been stuck in the Outer Rims on a mission. Seeing as Darth Sidious will make a surprise return in <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i>, the Knights of Ren could come home with Sith secrets that could the course of the galaxy forever.</p>
      <p>In addition to the Knights of Ren, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/e0kvvq/whoever_kylo_and_his_forces_are_fighting_seem_to/"><i>Reddit</i> user</a> spotted what could be a tie-in with <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/disney-plus">Disney+</a>‘s <i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/the-mandalorian">The Mandalorian</a></i> series — yellow blaster bolts can be seen firing behind Kylo Ren about halfway through the teaser, and seeing as the color is most often used by Mandalorians (the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/star-wars">Star Wars</a> galaxy’s states have usually used either red, green or blue bolts), there’s a possible chance a Mandalorian is involved in the final film.</p>
      <p>Watch the TV spot above. <i>Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker</i> hits theaters December 20.</p>
