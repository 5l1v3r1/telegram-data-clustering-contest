      <h1>Google Nest Mini now available in India for ₹4,499 ($63)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T03:13:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 03:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/aamirsiddiqui/" target="_blank">Aamir Siddiqui</a></address>
      <p>At the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/made-by-google-2019/">Made by Google event for 2019</a>, Google announced the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-nest-mini-google-assistant-smart-speaker/">new Google Nest Mini</a>, among other products such as the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-4-specs-features-pricing-availability/">Google Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL</a>, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-nest-wifi-smart-speaker/">Google Nest WiFi</a>, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/new-google-pixel-buds-truly-wireless-earbuds/">Google Pixel Buds</a>, and the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixelbook-go-chromebook/">Google Pixelbook Go</a>. While devices like the Pixel 4 series have been <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-4-not-available-in-india/">confirmed to not come to India at all</a>, Google is at least launching the Nest Mini in the country. Today, the company has officially announced the new Google Nest Mini will be sold in India officially for a price of ₹4,499 ($63).</p>
      <p>The Google Nest Mini is a smart speaker with <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/google-assistant/">Google Assistant</a> support. You can ask the Assistant questions about the weather, traffic, places, flights, movie times, and so much more. You can create routines to automate certain actions, and you can also control any product that integrates with the Google Assistant ecosystem. Finally, you can cast any audio to the device using Google Cast or Bluetooth, which is why the device is called a smart “speaker.”</p>
      <p>While Google pitches the Nest Mini as a successor to the Home Mini, it is virtually identical to the Home Mini. The two devices are exactly the same shape with a short, circular design, and they’re also the same size at 42mm in height and 98mm in circumference. Both devices are also covered by Google’s signature fabric material which is overlaid on top of 4 LEDs in the middle. They’re both powered by a single micro-USB cable, lack a 3.5mm headphone port for audio output, have a mute switch on the side, support Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n/ac dual-band (2.4 / 5.0 GHz), and support Bluetooth (though the new device supports 5.0). The only major difference between the two is that the new Nest Mini can be easily hung on a wall by attaching the device to a hook or screw.</p>
