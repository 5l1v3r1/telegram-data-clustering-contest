      <h4>During her speech she said;</h4>
      <blockquote>"I grew up watching shows like this, and I would sit at home wide-eyed, and I would watch artists in these beautiful gowns and handsome suits stroll up the stairs to the stage, and they would hold up these awards, These trophies that were supposed to be some kind of validation for the soul-crushing and heartache inducing work that they put in to writing a song."</blockquote>
      <p>She questioned the voting process behind the Grammys, which is selected after voting ballots are sent to the NARAS voting members.</p>
      <h4>Halsey continued;</h4>
      <blockquote>"Most of these awards aren't really what they seem. I am so thankful to the AMAs, because they are the world's largest fan-voted awards show. And I am thankful to the fans because they're the people who give a sh*t about music. And I'm thankful to the AMAs for giving those people a voice." Halsey ended her speech by assuring her fans that she was going to keep on making music, before thanking those who had voted for her.</blockquote>
      <p>This outburt comes after the nominations for the 2020 Grammys was announced, and Halsey was nowhere to be seen in the nominations.</p>
      <h4>Halsey responded to the shocking snub, by taking to Twitter and writing to her 12.1 million followers</h4>
      <blockquote>"Please do not waste your anger or frustration. I see a lot of you are upset. Of course im sad too. None of it matters. Literally none of it. You're here. Im here. + Everything is gonna stay exactly the same and without me is still a super tight, record breaking song."</blockquote>
