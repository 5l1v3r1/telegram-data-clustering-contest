      <p>The event is organised by Next Einstein Forum (NEF), a platform that connects science, society and policy in Africa and the rest of the world.</p>
      <p>Briefing journalists in Dar es Salaam during the weekend, representative of NEF’s Ambassador in Tanzania, Sophia Abeid said that stakeholder and students pursuing careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) will come together to strengthen research networks and communities of scientists in the country.</p>
      <p>According to her, by bringing together key stakeholders from all sectors, they hope to catalyse investment in research and development and discuss best practices for attracting and retaining young people, especially girls and women, in the sciences,” he added.</p>
      <p>“Our primary objective is to develop tomorrow’s scientists and technologists by engaging children and young people in scientific activities. Our activities will also demonstrate the critical impact of science to the general public,” she said.</p>
      <p>Further, she said, “NEF is building a community of scientists which includes NEF Fellows, top scientists under 42 living and working across the world in fields such as science communication and public engagement activities locally.”</p>
      <p>For his part, Programme coordinator at Projekt Inspire Issaya Ipyana said that the Dar es Salaam event will involve coding workshop and training to secondary school students from various schools.</p>
      <p>“This will be a one-day coding workshop for secondary school female students from 20 different schools in Dar es Salaam, and will be held at Almuntazir Schools, Upanga. This would be a great avenue to expose students to the digital world and how that can be used to the development,” he said.</p>
      <p>On the side of Tanga region, Ipyana said that students will participate in guided science projects with science kits in chemistry, electricity and technology, and an interactive science and technology career discussion.</p>
      <p>“From December 4 to 6, in partnership with experts from Switzerland, we will conduct parallel teacher’s capacity building workshop on academic approaches to teaching science to pupils.”</p>
      <p>He further said; “NEF will also conduct a technology workshop with secondary school girls; it will involve an average of 20 to 30 girls with interest in coding/ robotics/ technology the theme will be “using drones for nature conservation. The girls will get an opportunity to fly the mini drones in doors and also, do some outdoor activities.”</p>
      <p>Grantina Modern, event coordinator in Arusha region, said that there will be also awards given to young Tanzanian women in science who have been involved in STEM outreach projects aimed to address community problems.</p>
      <p>“The awards event will be conducted at the Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology-Arusha bringing over 250 scientists and innovators from inside and outside the country. This will also be an opportunity to unveil the future Tanzanian female scientists and encourage their involvement within the community of scientists,” she said.</p>
