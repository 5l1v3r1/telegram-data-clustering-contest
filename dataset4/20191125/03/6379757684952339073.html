      <p>The villages that benefited from the training are Korongo, Magadini, Kitwai A and B, Olchoronyori and Loonderkes.</p>
      <p>Speaking yesterday at Korongo village, coordinating and evaluating officer from Tanzania Natural Resource Forum (TNRF) a non-governmental organisation (NGO), Rogath Massay said 80 percent of the District’s residents were pastoralists which is the main source of their income and livelihood.</p>
      <p>He said this has driven him to educate them about impacts of climate change on livestock, farming, fisheries and mining.</p>
      <p>He said in partnership with Tanzania Meteorological Authority (TMA) they are engaged in enabling the wananchi to face up to the challenges of climate change particularly over delay of weather forecasts reaching them.</p>
      <p>Simanjiro District agricultural officer Jenifer Mbuya said traditional and scientific weather forecasts are of great help to pastoralists and farmers even though some of the traditional forecasts are not available as forecasters thereof have since died.</p>
      <p>The district veterinary official Yasini Mshana said both scientific and traditional weather forecasts were important for day to day activities for herders as they foretell them where to concentrate their grazing activities.</p>
      <p>The district’s agricultural environment officer Jovin Rweyemamu said in the past, traditional weather forecasting was strong than now, but now it is no longer the case.</p>
      <p>The people who benefited from the two-day education thanked TNRF for briefing them on the effects of climate change and called on other stakeholders to collaborate with the government to educate them on how to face up to the challenges of climate change.</p>
