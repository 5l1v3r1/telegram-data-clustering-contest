      <p>The 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, is an international campaign to challenge violence against women and girls. The annual event brings together network of organizations in the fight against gender based violence globally involving both public and private institutions.</p>
      <p>TBL’s Communications Manager, Abigail Mutaboyerwa said in Dar es Salaam over the weekend that the beer brewer will use the commemoration to conduct a campaign dubbed, ‘No Excuse’ to sensitise the public against excessive use of alcohol which then becomes an excuse for conducting GBV.</p>
      <p>“This year TBL will use different approach to provide education to communities including its employees in an exercise that will be done in collaboration with the Police Force’s gender desk at Chang’ombe in Temeke district and Kisarawe district,” Mutaboyerwa said.</p>
      <p>She said the ‘No Excuse’ campaign will continue to be used throughout the 16 days in sensitizing and conducting awareness to the community that responsible drinking is good to prevent violence against women and girls.</p>
      <p>“This year’s theme is ‘Generation equality stands against rape’ intends to inform the public on the effects of GBV and remind everyone in the society to change their mindset, break the silence and take action in order to protect future female leaders,” the TBL Communications Manager stated.</p>
      <p>“TBL believes that, GBV can be eliminated in the country if the entire community will work together and raise their voices but also take action against such abuses,” she added while stressing that in collaboration with the government and law enforcing organs, the Dar es Salaam based beer brewer believes GBV can be eliminated.</p>
