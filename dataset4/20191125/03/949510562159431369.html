      <p>HARMONSBURG, Pa. (AP) — Authorities say a man died following a hunting accident in western Pennsylvania over the weekend.</p>
      <p>State police in Meadville say 19-year-old Jacob Smith of Linesville was hunting with friends in Summit Township near the Conneaut Lake Park amusement park.</p>
      <p>The Crawford County coroner said Smith was removing items from a hunting sled when his shotgun accidentally went off shortly before 8:30 a.m. Saturday.</p>
      <p>Coroner Scott Schell told the Meadville Tribune that shotgun pellets struck Smith in the abdomen. He was taken to Meadville Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>Schell ruled Smith’s death accidental. State police and the Pennsylvania Game Commission are investigating.</p>
