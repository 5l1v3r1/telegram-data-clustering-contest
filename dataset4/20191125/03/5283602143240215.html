      <p>The Benchmark Sensex on Monday surged 530 points to hit a fresh closing high of 40,889.23, driven by gains mainly in telecom, metal and auto stocks, amid renewed optimism over US-China trade truce.</p>

      <p>Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty settled just shy of its life-time closing high, up 164 points at 12,079.75.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, ONGC fell 2.17 per cent and Yes Bank shed 1.70 per cent.</p>

      <p>Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo were trading up to 1.50 per cent higher.</p>
      <p>Stocks in Europe were also trading on a positive note.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/stocks/bharti-airtel-ltd/overview/">Airtel </a>has told the Supreme Court that there was no wilful default in the payment of licence fee in the form of Adjusted Gross Revenue.</p>
      <p>In a review petition filed by the telecom operator, the operator has argued that since it had won five rounds of litigation previously, there was no justification for paying interest and penalty on the disputed amount. “The interpretation of AGR has been in dispute since 2003 before the expert bodies as well as the court. It is stated that since all those judgements were ruled in favour of the petitioner (Airtel), it has acted on the basis of the directions given in those judgements,” Airtel has said in its review petition before the Supreme Court.

      <p>The rupee (INR) seems to be indecisive in its movement against the dollar (USD) as it continues to consolidate within the tight range between 71.7 and 71.9. Thus, the broader range between 71.6 and 72 is still valid and the domestic currency can be expected to trend only if it moves out of the range. As we can observe, the support at 72 remains strong in the weekly chart.

      <p>The dollar and export-focused currencies edged higher on Monday on broadly upbeat headlines about US-China trade talks, while the pound climbed on hopes of an imminent Brexit and an end to years of political paralysis.</p>
      <p>Moves were marginal, however, as scepticism and weariness of newsflow about both US-China trade negotiations and Brexit kept investors cautious.</p>

      <p>The rupee on Monday fell 2 paise to 71.73 against the US dollar in early trade, amid increased demand for the greenback by banks and importers.</p>
      <p>Strengthening crude oil prices also impacted the rupee movement in the market, forex dealers said.</p>
      <p>However, a higher opening in the domestic equity markets and persistent foreign fund inflows restricted the rupee’s fall, they added.

      <p>For the past few quarters, some of the large- and mid-tier IT services companies have been growing at a fair clip and bagging large deals. Digital deals have started to form a larger part of their revenues while core services for most large- and mid-sized players have seen tepid growth; most of the information-technology services companies’ revenue growth was supported by digital.</p>
      <p>But the global economic slowdown and the US-China trade war have had a direct impact on many Indian IT services companies. Except for HCL Technologies, which has increased its revenue guidance (Infosys upped the lower-end of its revenue guidance), most Indian IT services companies have cut their FY20 guidances.

      <p>It was another monotonous week for the equity benchmark indices, the Sensex and the Nifty, as they moved in a sideways range. However, this time, the bias is negative as the significant resistances remain resilient, and there are initial signs of weakness.</p>
      <p>Therefore, investors with a short-term perspective need to be watchful in the ensuing derivatives expiry week. Both the mid- and small-cap indices were also choppy in the past week and continue to show signs of weakness.</p>

        <b>Weekly Trading Guide for week beginning November 25, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <h3>SBI (₹329.3)</h3>
      <p>After inching past the resistance at ₹324 — the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the prior bullish trend — the stock of SBI had been largely trendless and hovering around ₹330 over the past few trading sessions. But it has managed to form a higher peak, and the 21-day moving average continues to stay above the 50-day moving average, a bullish indication. As long as the price stays above ₹320, the near-term outlook for the stock looks positive. However, one needs to be cautious about certain weakness shown by indicators. By plotting the relative strength index in the daily chart, we can observe that the new high in the stock price is not accompanied by a new high in the indicator. This could lead to formation of a bearish divergence. Also, the moving average convergence divergence indicator is showing a loss of momentum in the uptrend. Hence, it is advised not be outright bullish and apply caution while taking new positions. If the stock gains momentum and advances, it will most likely reach ₹335 with ₹347 as the resistance above it. But if the stock declines from the current level, it has a support within a short span at ₹324. The subsequent support is at ₹315.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>ITC (₹247.6)</h3>
      <p>The bearish trend continued as the stock of ITC declined last week. Noticeably, the stock has been in a downtrend since the beginning of the month, after marking its recent high at ₹266.3. Closing at ₹247.6, the stock closed with a loss for a third consecutive week. On Thursday, the stock closed below the support band between ₹247 and ₹250, confirming the break of the support. The uptick in price that followed seems to be a mere retracement before further weakening. Also, the price has slipped below the 50-day moving average. The daily relative strength index has dipped below the mid-point level of 50, and the moving average convergence divergence indicator has entered the negative territory, both of which indicate a bleak outlook for the stock. Thus, the possibility of continuation of the downtrend cannot be neglected. The stock will find support at ₹242, below which the support is at ₹234.05 — a 52-week low — where some profit- booking can be expected. But if price breaches that level, sell-off can intensify as the stock could attract more bears. On the other hand, if the stock recovers from the current level, ₹250 will act as a hurdle; beyond that, the resistance is at ₹258.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Infosys (₹693.2)</h3>
      <p>The stock of Infosys, after a sharp decline in October, has been on a recovery phase since the beginning of November. But recently, the price seems to be consolidating within a range between ₹690 and ₹725. The 21-day moving average coincides with the lower boundary of the range, making the support significant. Hence, the recent uptrend will not be under threat until the price stays above ₹690 and the short-term outlook is positive. But for the recovery to sustain, the stock must break out of the upper boundary of the range at ₹725. Of late, the moving average convergence divergence indicator suggests a loss in bullish momentum. So, a prolonged consolidation might trigger a downward movement. From a trading perspective, it is advisable to wait for the price to breach either of the boundaries of the range. Assuming that the stock breaks out of ₹725, the recovery will lift the price to ₹760. This is a critical level as the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the previous bear trend coincides with the 50-day moving average. Further appreciation will take the stock price to ₹800. Alternatively, if the stock breaks down from the range, it could slump to ₹665, below which the support is at ₹620.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>RIL (₹1,546.5)</h3>
      <p>Continuing with the strong rally, the stock of Reliance Industries registered a new lifetime high at ₹1,572.4 last week. The returns on the stock for the week was 5.1 per cent, indicating a substantial strength in the bullish trend. The corrective rally in the first week of November seems to be acting as a strong base for the stock to build a sustainable uptrend; the price is expected to clock new highs from the current levels in coming days. Though the stock is bullish, a couple of daily candlesticks in the past week has formed a shooting star pattern. This denotes a possible trend-reversal. Hence, it is recommended to initiate fresh long positions once the stock advances beyond ₹1,572.4, which could invalidate the pattern. But there are certain factors playing out in favour of the stock. The daily relative strength index is showing an uptick and the moving average convergence divergence indicator has moved back into the positive territory, hinting an improved bullish strength. On the back of this, if the stock breaks out of ₹1,572.4, it will most likely appreciate to ₹1,617 and to ₹1,665 beyond it. If the stock undergoes a correction, it has a support at ₹1,530. Below that level, the stock could decline to ₹1,500, which is a key support.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Tata Steel (₹400)</h3>
      <p>Though the stock of Tata Steel was volatile during the past week, it failed to trend in any direction. A mid-week decline was arrested by the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous bullish trend at ₹383. This level, along with the support at ₹380 has formed a support band. Also, ₹380 is the neck level of the double bottom pattern in the weekly chart. Hence, until the stock manages to trade above ₹380, the chances for price appreciation are high. Adding to it, the stock has bounced from the 21-day moving average at ₹392 and also remains above the 50-day moving average. But for the rally to be sustainable, the stock should decisively break out of ₹415. Even though the stock is staying above ₹380, there are certain indications to be wary of. The daily relative strength index is showing a downtick and the moving average convergence divergence indicator is exhibiting weakness by slipping below the zero level. The next leg of the trend will be established only if the stock either breaks ₹380 or ₹415. If it breaks out of ₹415, it can appreciate to ₹440, whereas a break below ₹380 may drag the price to ₹360.</p>
