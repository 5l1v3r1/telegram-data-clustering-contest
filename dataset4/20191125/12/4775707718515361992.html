      <h3>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Comes to Xbox Game Pass on December 19</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sean+Carey">Sean Carey</a>, 25 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>It was <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39723/xbox-game-pass-reveals-x019">announced</a> at X019 that <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/The-Witcher-3-Wild-Hunt/achievements">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> would be joining the already stacked out <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-game-pass/games">Xbox Game Pass</a> lineup; however, we didn't have an official date as to when it would arrive, only "Holiday 2019". Now the Xbox Game Pass app is showing The Witcher 3 as coming to the service on December 19.</p>

      <p>The news was originally <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39690/the-witcher-3-xbox-game-pass?page=2">leaked via a Twitch</a> ad that, several hours before the X019 announcement, however, we weren't sure if it was the Game of the Year edition complete with both the Blood and Wine and Hearts of Stone expansions. Sadly, that isn't the case, but the standard version does feature 100+ hours of gameplay not to mention the sixteen DLCs that CD Projekt Red has released for free.</p>
      <p>The action-RPG is a strong contender for our Game of the Decade award. As it stands, the TA community has rated The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt a 4.82/5 from over 6500 votes. Our own site review has given the game a 5/5 and says, "It is now the gold standard to which all other RPGs will be held." The Witcher 3 is a game that everyone needs to play, at least once. Combat is varied with the right mix of magic and swordplay, while the story is gripping and a joy to play through. Some of the side-quests can even be as complex and detailed as the main storyline. If you add the two expansions on top of the base game, you're looking at another 50+ hours of content. The Witcher 3 is really one of the best RPGs ever made.</p>
      <p>The Witcher 3 can seem a bit daunting to jump into with its rich world, varying factions and vast map. However, you can play it without needing to play the first two entries into the series, although if you really want to know more about Witcher lore, it's probably worth checking out the first two games or doing some reading online.</p>
      <p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt comes to <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-game-pass/games">Xbox Game Pass</a> on December 19 and will set you back around 40GB of storage space.</p>
