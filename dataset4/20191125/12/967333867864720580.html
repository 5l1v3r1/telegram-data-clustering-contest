        <b>US Navy SEAL Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher had been demoted in rank following a July conviction for posing in a photo with the body of a dead terrorist during a 2017 deployment in Iraq. Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump ordered that the Navy restore Gallagher’s status.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that as far as he was concerned, the case of a Navy SEAL, who was convicted of battlefield crimes in Iraq, was closed.</p>
      <blockquote>"I think at this point the secretary of defence has made decisions (and) the case is now, in my view, it is closed," Mark Milley said.</blockquote>
      <p>On Friday, US President Donald Trump pardoned Army First Lieutenant Clint Lorance and Army Major Mathew Golsteyn and restored the rank to Navy Seal Edward Gallagher, who was recently demoted following acquittal of murder charges.</p>
      <h3>Navy SEAL Case</h3>
      <p>Mathew Golsteyn had been set to stand trial for an allegedly killing of a detained terrorist bomb-maker in Afghanistan, reportedly due to fear the prisoner would continue to threaten American troops.</p>
      <p>Clint Lorance was convicted earlier on charges that he ordered his men to shoot three men on a motorcycle speeding in their direction. Lorance served more than six years of a 19-year sentence for the 2012 incident in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>Edward Gallagher had been demoted following a July conviction for posing in a photo with the body of a dead terrorist during a 2017 deployment in Iraq but cleared of murder charges stemming from the fighter’s fatal stabbing.</p>
