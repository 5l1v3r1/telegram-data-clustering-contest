      <p>TUMPAT, Nov 25 — The government lost about RM90 million in unpaid duties this year as 1,800 vehicles were brought into the country illegally.</p>
      <p>Royal Malaysian Customs Department director-general, Datuk Seri Paddy Abdul Halim said the vehicles were seized across the country through various operations conducted by the agency from January till yesterday.</p>
      <p>“The vehicles were initially brought into the country without tax exemption on a temporary basis, but some syndicates and individuals used various tricks to avoid paying duties.</p>
      <p>“The vehicles were then sold at a lower price to customers, and it was in violation of the law, as they do not have valid ownership grants and road tax stickers,” he told a press conference at the Pengkalan Kubor Customs office, here, today.</p>
      <p>He said among the tricks used were changing the licence plate number, as well as forging the grant and the vehicle’s chassis number.</p>
      <p>“Most of the vehicles were brought in from Singapore, and the syndicates changed the original licence plate numbers to Thai plate numbers.</p>
      <p>“We also suspect the involvement of insiders and further investigation will be conducted on this matter. However, no suspects have been arrested so far,” he said.</p>
      <p>Paddy said in Kelantan alone, the Customs Department had seized 111 vehicles this year worth RM2.8 million, with tax losses amounting to RM3.8 million.</p>
      <p>He advised the public not to trust anyone who offered imported cars at cheap prices, as these were likely to be cloned cars.</p>
      <p>“The public can check with Customs to ensure the vehicle purchased is legal,” he added. — Bernama</p>
