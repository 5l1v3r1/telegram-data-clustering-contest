      <p>Morrisons is the first supermarket in the UK to offer food past its 'best before' date through a new app called Too Good to Go.</p>
      <p>It offers customers food directly to them for a great price.</p>
      <p>Customers will be able to use the Too Good to Go app to purchase the boxes of unsold fruit and veg, bakery and deli items worth at least £10 for £3.09.</p>
      <p>The contents of the box are then revealed when picked up from the local <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/shopping-in-bristol">supermarket</a>.</p>
      <p>The service has been trialled across a number of stores and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/morrisons">Morrisons</a> has now announced that it will be available in all 494 Morrisons supermarkets nationwide from tomorrow (Tuesday 26 November).</p>

      <p>The move aims to help customers on a budget and to provide another channel for food which might otherwise be wasted.</p>
      <p>Morrisons expects to distribute 350,000 boxes of unsold food in 2020. This will reduce CO2 emissions by 882 tonnes: the equivalent of driving from London to Edinburgh 5,351 times.</p>
      <p>Morrisons is committed to reducing operational food waste by 50 per cent by 2030.</p>
      <p>Jayne Wall, Market Street Director at Morrisons, has said: “We are using technology to help us reduce food waste and to help more people afford to eat well. It will also mean we waste less food this Christmas as it will find a home for products that can’t be sold after the festive period."</p>

      <p>Hayley Conick is the UK Country Manager at Too Good to Go and said: “Every single day perfectly edible food goes to waste simply because it isn’t sold, and this is having detrimental effects on our planet.</p>
      <p>"In fact, food waste contributes to 8 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. We need greater awareness of the issue of food waste, so we are delighted to welcome Morrisons as our first UK supermarket partner.</p>
      <p>"Together we can fight food waste and ensure that quality surplus produce doesn’t end up in the bin.”</p>
