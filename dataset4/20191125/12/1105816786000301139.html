      <h1>Army announces top-level postings</h1>

      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>Just days before Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa is to begin his second three-year term, the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi on Monday announced high-level promotions and postings.</p>
      <p>The reshuffle was due since the retirement of Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Zubair Mehmood Hayat and appointment of Lt General Nadeem Raza as his successor.</p>
      <p>The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that two major generals — including Ali Amir Awan and Mohammad Saeed — were promoted to the rank of Lt. Generals.</p>
      <p>The newly-promoted Lt General, Ali Amir Awan, was posted as Inspector General Communication and Information Technology while Lt General Muhammad Saeed was appointed as National Defence University (NDU) president.</p>
      <p>In other transfers, Lt General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, who was serving as Adjutant General at the GHQ, was appointed as CGC, which is considered the most powerful position within the army hierarchy after post of the army chief. The CGC heads both the army’s operational and intelligence directorates.</p>
      <p>The position was earlier held by the incoming CJCSC General Nadeem Raza.</p>
      <p>Similarly, Lt Gen Muhammad Amir will not replace Lt General Sahir Shamshad Mirza as Adjutant General.</p>
      <p>Lt Gen Shaheen Mazhar Mehmood, who was previously commanding Peshawar Corps, has been appointed as Commander Mangla Corps, which is one of the strike formations of Pakistan Army.</p>
      <p>According to the military’s media wing, Lt Gen Nauman Mahmood has been appointed as Commander Peshawar Corps. He was previously serving as Inspector General Communications &amp; Information Technology (IG C&amp;IT) at the GHQ.</p>
      <p>Lt Gen Nadeem Zaki Manj, who was previously commanding Mangla Corps, has now been appointed as the Director-General Strategic Plans Division, replacing the out-going Lt Gen Sarfraz Sattar, who was superseded when the appointment of CJCSC was made last week by the prime minister.</p>
      <p>The new appointments and postings suggest that the army chief will begin his next three-year tenure from November 29 with a new team.</p>
      <p>General Qamar was reappointed in August by the prime minister, citing the regional security environment.</p>
      <p>There were speculations whether formal notification had been issued regarding his reappointment. But last week the government put to rest all such rumours when it announced the appointment of new CJCSC.</p>
      <p>The PM Office statement, while appointing the new CJCSC, also clarified that the notification for the reappointment of General Qamar for another three-year term was issued on August 19.</p>
