      <p>An associate of President Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani gave the House Intelligence Committee audio and video recordings and photographs of the president and Giuliani.</p>
      <p>The material given to the committee, which has held impeaching hearings on Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine in recent weeks, was provided by Lev Parnas, who assisted Giuliani in his efforts to investigate 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-intelligence-committee-possession-video-audio-recordings-giuliani/story?id=67276448">according to ABC News</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear what is discussed on the recordings or what the photographs show.</p>
      <p>The material was handed over in response to a congressional subpoena. Some of the material sought by congressional investigators is being held by Southern District of New York investigators, preventing it from being turned over to Congress.</p>
      <p>Parnas and another Giuliani associate, Igor Fruman, were arrested in October on charges of illegal campaign contributions brought by the Southern District of New York. Both men have pleaded not guilty. Parnas, however, has <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/giuliani-associate-signals-readiness-to-cooperate-with-trump-impeachment-effort">signaled his willingness</a> to cooperate in the impeachment process.</p>
