      <h1>Raheem Sterling stalling on new Manchester City contract?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/raheem-sterling/"><b>Raheem Sterling</b></a> reportedly has no plans to sign a further extension to his contract at <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-city/"><b>Manchester City</b></a> for the foreseeable future.</h2>

      <p>Despite only penning a fresh deal late last year, interest from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> has led to City wanting to hand improved terms to the England international.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>The Sun</i>, the 24-year-old is happy with his current contract at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p>The report suggests that the winger will delay making a decision on the next stage of his career until knowing whether <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pep-guardiola/"><b>Pep Guardiola</b></a> will prolong his stay at the Premier League champions.</p>
      <p>Sterling still has three-and-a-half years left on his current deal at the north-west outfit.</p>
