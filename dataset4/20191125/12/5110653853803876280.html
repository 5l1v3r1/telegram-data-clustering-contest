      <h1>Cowboys vs. Patriots final score: New England's defense controls Dallas in low-scoring win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:03:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:03</time> by <a rel="author">James Crabtree-Hannigan</a></address>
      <p>If the Patriots hope to repeat as Super Bowl champions, they'll likely have to win some ugly games along the way. They reaffirmed their ability to do just that Sunday against the Cowboys, relying on defense in a 13-9 win on a rainy, windy day in New England.</p>
      <p>Dallas, which falls to 6-5 but is still has a one-game lead onthe NFC East by a game, never got in the end zone as quarterback Dak Prescott and the offense continued to struggle against quality competition. Prescott was 19 for 33 through the air for 212 yards and an interception, part of a Dallas offensive performance that netted just 130 yards after halftime. It was the fourth time this year the Patriots (10-1) haven't allowed a touchdown.</p>
      <p>
        <b>PLAYOFF PICTURE: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-playoff-picture-updated-standings-week-12/uycygk7jzz9s1av2s6nv1jwoc">Updated standings for Week 12</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>The game's only touchdown was set up by a blocked punt by Patriots special teams ace Matthew Slater late in the first quarter. The block set up New England on the Dallas 12, and quarterback Tom Brady hit wide receiver N'Keal Harry for a 10-yard score two plays later. Brady was far from stellar himself, completing 17 of 37 attempts for 190 yards and a touchdown.</p>
      <p>Harry's touchdown opened scoring, and the Patriots held a 10-6 advantage at halftime. The second half started with six consecutive punts before New England extended the lead with Nick Folk's third field goal of the game. Folk's stat line was about as good as any other Patriot's.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Dallas moved to the Patriots' 11 on the following drive but settled for another field goal. Then, the visitors forced a punt to get Prescott the ball back on his own 5 with 2:38 to play, only for the offense to move the chains just once before turning the ball over on downs. New England then turned to running back Sony Michel (20 carries, 85 yards) to convert a first down and ice the Patriots' victory.</p>
