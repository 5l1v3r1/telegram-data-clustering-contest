      <h1>Philippines rescues British man, wife held by jihadists</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:41:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:41</time> by <a rel="author">The Jakarta Post</a></address>
      <p>Philippine soldiers on Monday rescued a British man and his wife from Islamic State-linked jihadists nearly two months after the couple was kidnapped from their beach resort in the nation's south, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Troops recovered the pair after a firefight with gunmen from the Abu Sayyaf group on the restive southern island of Jolo, which is a stronghold of the kidnap-for-ransom gang that has been behind some of the worst attacks in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>"There was a brief exchange of fire, but they later abandoned the couple after being overwhelmed by pursuing government forces," Lieutenant General Cirilito Sobejana told <i>AFP</i>, adding the hostages were unharmed. </p>
      <p>Regional army spokesman Arvin Encinas said no ransom was paid. </p>
      <p>The British embassy in Manila confirmed the rescue of Alan and Wilma Hyrons, saying in a statement "we extend our gratitude to the government and authorities of the Philippines".</p>
      <p>Armed men abducted the couple on October 4 at their beach resort on the southern island of Mindanao, which makes up the southern third of the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Muslim separatists have led a decades-long insurgency in the south of the Catholic-majority Philippines, which has led to the death of tens of thousands of people. </p>
      <p>While the government has negotiated peace with the largest group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, hardline factions allied with the Islamic State group are not part of the accord.</p>
      <p>IS claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing of a Sunday mass in January at a Catholic cathedral on Jolo which killed 21 in the country's worst attack in years.</p>
      <p>Authorities blamed the bombing on Abu Sayyaf, which in part funds its violence with ransom payments.</p>
      <p>Dutch birdwatcher Ewold Horn, who was kidnapped in 2012 in the southern Philippines, was killed in May during a firefight between his Abu Sayyaf captors and the military. </p>
