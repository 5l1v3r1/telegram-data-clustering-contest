      <p>Rakesh Marwaha, the former accountable officer of Erewash Clinical Commissioning Group, is not expected to have to repay any of the money to the CCG.</p>
      <p>Last week, <i>HSJ</i> reported another manager, Ian Stidston, had <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/workforce/exclusive-hancock-at-odds-with-nhs-over-managers-redundancy-pay/7026376.article">not been asked to repay any of his £210,000 redundancy package</a> from Castle Point and Rochford CCG when he started working for Thurrock CCG less than a year later. This was despite health and social care secretary Matt Hancock telling Essex MPs it would be repaid and the money put into patient care.</p>
      <p>Mr Marwaha, who left Erewash CCG in September 2017, was taken on by NHS England as a strategic commercial adviser on the high cost tariff excluded devices programme between November 2017 and September 2018, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rakesh-marwaha-b4a00ab/?originalSubdomain=uk">according to his LinkedIn page</a>.</p>
      <p>Upon leaving the CCG, Mr Marwaha was paid the maximum £160,000 redundancy plus £41,494 pay in lieu of notice. He was one of <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/workforce/revealed-additional-payments-push-senior-payoffs-above-nhs-limit/7026084.article">three accountable officers in Derbyshire who were made redundant when four CCGs merged into one:</a> <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/workforce/revealed-additional-payments-push-senior-payoffs-above-nhs-limit/7026084.article">their redundancy packages alone cost more than £600,000</a>.</p>
      <p>Although the NHSE role was not full time, <i>HSJ</i> understands he worked for more than 15 days in every 90, meaning some of his redundancy package could have been reclaimed.</p>
      <p><i>HSJ</i> understands NHS England is to “expand” the rules around procuring consultancy services to ensure that any redundancy repayments are made at the correct time when former very senior managers take up consultancy positions.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the merged CCG — Derby and Derbyshire CCG — said: “The CCG has not been notified that any of the outgoing chief officers have been re-employed or re-engaged in the NHS, as specified in the NHS standard contract, within 12 months of their redundancy, and therefore [they] have not been asked to repay their redundancy payments.”</p>
      <p>The NHS standard contract states any NHS provider, which includes NHSE, should require anyone they are hiring to disclose if they have been made redundant from a very senior manager position and then require them to inform their previous NHS employer of their job offer, which could trigger repayments. If the provider does not comply with this, it is responsible for any repayments of redundancy which are due.</p>
      <p>NHSE said in a statement: “These rules must be followed, and action will be taken if and when any apparent individual discrepancies are identified.”</p>
      <p><i>HSJ</i> has approached Mr Marwaha for comment.</p>
