      <p>It's challenging enough to attract and hire qualified employees in today's <a href="https://www.inc.com/adam-robinson/how-employers-can-help-3-common-job-seeker-frustrations-in-todays-competitive-hiring-market.html">tight labor market</a>, so once you have top talent on board, your team needs to put in extra effort to support a positive <a href="https://www.inc.com/adam-robinson/new-study-finds-employee-enthusiasm-dips-significantly-after-first-few-weeks-heres-why.html">employee experience</a>. Otherwise, your best new hires likely won't stay with your team <a href="https://www.inc.com/adam-robinson/new-study-finds-close-to-half-of-us-employees-plan-on-quitting-in-next-year-3-ways-to-keep-your-team-engaged.html">for the long haul</a>. </p>
      <p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-10-29-gartner-says-only-13--of-employees-are-largely-satisf">Gartner study</a> of employees from across the U.S., only 13 percent of employees are largely satisfied with their work experiences. Additionally, nearly half (46 percent of employees) are largely dissatisfied with their work experiences. And when employees aren't satisfied with their current roles, they're likely to start looking for new jobs elsewhere. </p>
      <p>Given these findings, what can your team do to support a positive employee experience? I've highlighted a few tips for you to consider below. </p>
      <h3>1. Set clear expectations and goals.</h3>
      <p>A key reason many employees become dissatisfied with their work experience is because they accept a job offer, only to realize the day-to-day role wasn't what they were expecting. Starting with your job descriptions, make sure prospective job applicants have a clear understanding of what to expect from your open roles. Include an accurate overview of the day-to-day responsibilities, so you attract top candidates who are motivated by these responsibilities.</p>
      <p>If your job descriptions don't align with the actual role, not only will you end up with dissatisfied employees, but you might also hire candidates who aren't a fit for the role itself. </p>
      <p>During each new employee's first week, key job responsibilities should be discussed with his or her manager, along with any goals or metrics that will be used to measure success in the role. If it's unclear what's needed to succeed in the role, employees who ultimately want to grow in their career paths will become frustrated and seek opportunities elsewhere.</p>
      <h3>2. Collect employee feedback.</h3>
      <p>In many cases, employers find out about why employees are dissatisfied when it's too late,  such as during an employee exit interview. Instead of waiting until an employee is about to walk out the door to receive feedback on their experience, your team should be proactive when it comes to collecting employee feedback across the board.</p>
      <p>If you don't already, your team should have a process to collect employee feedback on a regular basis. One option is to distribute employee feedback surveys. Through these surveys, you can collect general feedback about various aspects of your organization and culture, as well as encourage employees to rank the overall employee experience on a set scale. </p>
      <p>In employee feedback surveys, also leave space for open-ended comments, but make sure these comments are anonymous, so employees feel comfortable sharing candid feedback. And once you receive the survey results, consider setting up small focus groups with employees who are willing to share more direct feedback. </p>
      <h3>3. Focus on improving the employee experience. </h3>
      <p>Whether you receive feedback from employee surveys, or directly from an employee who shared some frustrations about his or her experience, the next step you need to take is acting on this feedback. Share the results of the employee feedback survey with the team as a whole and let them know the steps you plan to take to improve the employee experience. </p>
      <p>For example, some employees might share feedback that they don't see room for career growth in their roles. If this is the case, you can set a plan in place to create more defined career paths, along with measurable goals employees can strive toward to earn promotions. Or if you receive feedback that employees don't know whether or not the business is reaching its goals, you can put in the effort to be more transparent about business results. </p>
      <p>In today's competitive hiring market, you can't afford to lose your top performers simply because they aren't satisfied with their employee experience. Improving the employee experience takes effort, but will help your team keep your employees engaged and motivated to drive results for your team for the long haul.</p>
