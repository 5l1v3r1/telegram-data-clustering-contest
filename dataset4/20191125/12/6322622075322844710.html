      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 25): EITA Resources Bhd’s fourth quarter net profit grew 59.03% to RM5.85 million, from RM3.68 million a year ago, in tandem with higher revenue from the manufacturing and high voltage system segments.</p>
      <p>Earnings per share for the quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 (4QFY19) rose to 4.5 sen from 2.83 sen.</p>
      <p>The elevator manufacturer said the higher earnings was also due to the reversal of inventories written down to net realisable value.</p>
      <p>Quarterly revenue was up 74.85% to RM105.23 million, from RM60.18 million previously, according to EITA’s filing with the local stock exchange.</p>
      <p>For the full year (FY19), net profit increased 8.23% to RM20.83 million or 16.02 sen per share, from RM19.25 million or 14.8 sen per share in FY18, while revenue rose 16.87% to RM305.39 million from RM261.3 million.</p>
      <p>Besides higher revenue and reversal of inventories written down to net realisable value, EITA said its improved profits was also due to the unrealised foreign exchange gain on the fair value valuation of the forward exchange contracts.</p>
      <p>The group declared a dividend of three sen per share for the year.</p>
      <p>On prospects, EITA expects the general business environment in 2020 to remain challenging.</p>
      <p>Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the board of directors will continue to be vigilant to changes in the external environment and continue to strike to deliver satisfactory results, EITA said.</p>
      <p>Shares of EITA closed unchanged at RM1.51 today, valuing the company at RM196.29 million.</p>
