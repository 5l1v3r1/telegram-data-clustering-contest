      <p>Accra, Nov. 25, GNA - The Ablekuma Central Community Action for Development (ACCAD), a community development non-governmental organisation, has organised the second edition of the Ablekuma Central Municipal Assembly Aspirants public engagement at the Laterbiokoshie Electoral Area.</p>
      <p>The event is organised by ACCAD across the various electoral areas within the Assembly, where aspirants engaged with the public to present their policies and plans to them. </p>
      <p>The five assembly member aspirants, including Muntari Awudu Wahab, David Nii Abbey, George Manu, George Nii sackey and Nii Kpante Addy,  promised peace and development if giving the nod to lead the electoral area.</p>
      <p>The aspirants made promises ranging from youth empowerment and job creation, security, sanitation and the provision of street lightening systems in the area.</p>
      <p>They promised to intensify lobbying with the Municipal assembly to prioritise the development of the electoral area in the municipality in terms of infrastructure and social services.</p>
      <p>The aspirants promised to empower the youth of the area by equipping them with skills trainings and educational support, as well as provide alternative talent developments in sports and creative arts.</p>
      <p>In the area of sanitation, most aspirants promised to form community groups to champion disilting of gutters and the proper disposal of waste.</p>
      <p>They promised to collaborate with security agencies and traditional leaders in the area to form community vigilance groups to help reduce the alarming crime rate in the area.</p>
      <p>Mr Ebenezer Annang, the President of ACCAD, said the event was to empower the people of the electoral area on the need to participate in the governance and hold their leadership at the local level accountable.</p>
      <p>Mr Annang said ACCAD was going to continue to empower the communities in the municipality and lead them in demanding development from their leaders.</p>
      <p>“ACCAD believes that true development will only take place in our communities if we, the members of the community, get involved in the local governance process,” he said.</p>
      <p>Some residents speaking to the Ghana News Agency thanked the organisers for creating such a platform for their aspiring local leaders to tell them their aims and visions.</p>
      <p>They hoped that the aspirants would do as they promised if elected.</p>
