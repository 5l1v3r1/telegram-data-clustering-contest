      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has been caught re-tweeting a meme related to both BDSM and the upcoming general election.</p>
      <p>The tweet in question jokes about a woman telling her partner to tie her up and do “whatever he wants” with her; he does tie her up and leaves her alone, blindfolded, to register to vote in the UK general election.</p>
      <p>The image was originally posted by a Twitter account going by the nickname ‘libdem’ in response to the British journalist and documentary filmmaker Louis Theroux, who called on people to “get on it” and vote.</p>
      <p>The spicy post was complete with the caption “register to vote with memes louis, it sends the message better."</p>

      <p>Corbyn’s Twitter page re-tweeted the image around midnight, local time, on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The re-tweet sparked both enthusiasm and confusion among the British users who noticed it. One person wrote: “I can’t believe Corbyn retweeted this. What a boss.”</p>
      <p>Another said: “Not sure how I feel about Corbyn re-tweeting what he just retweeted.”</p>
      <p>“Feeling for the person on Corbyn’s social team who retweeted this,” read one reply.</p>
      <p>The Twitter account which posted the picture went private shortly thereafter – meaning that the picture was only visible to confirmed users – and Corbyn’s account undid the re-tweet so it no longer appears on his timeline.</p>
      <p>The general election – a second in two years – <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911191077342780-who-are-the-youngest-oldest-and-weirdest-candidates-in-uk-general-election/">is scheduled for 12 December 2019</a>; Britons must be on the electoral register to be eligible to vote. The deadline for those living in England, Scotland or Wales is 11:59 pm on 26 November.</p>
      <p>According to the latest polls, the Conservative Party is likely to win around 40 percent of the vote; with Labour is consistently polling at around 10 percent lower.</p>
      <p>However, the timing of the December vote may well affect the results. It is difficult to predict the voter turnout, but some analysts say that the weather in December – when the days are shorter and colder – <a href="https://sputniknews.com/columnists/201910311077191930-the-sputnik-intelligent-punters-guide-to-the-december-2019-uk-general-election/">may discourage some elderly UK residents</a>, most of whom typically support the Tories, from going to the polls. This could give Jeremy Corbyn’s party a slight advantage in what would probably be his last election as Labour leader.</p>
