          <p>For today’s opponents, there couldn’t have been a more colossal tie than the one dished up this Monday night. Although we are yet only in the early exchanges of the Indian Super League, ether side has fallen way behind a spot in the pinnacles of the points tally with yet another defeat today proving to be hazardous to their ambitions of making it into the ensuing stage of the league.</p>
          <p>Occupying the last two spaces in the league, for both Chennaiyin and new entrants Hyderabad, this edition of ISAL is turning out to be a howler of a time. More so for Chennaiyin with the side completely uninspiring to find themselves firmly hammered down in the bottom of the league standings.</p>

                <p>The only side to yet register a win in the league, the side have gone onto lose three of their encounters with their drab attacking unit seeing them earning for a goal despite having played four matches. The side have gone onto ship seven as well to see their goal difference lie at -7, a stinker of a figure which clearly alludes to the despondent brand of football the side have doled out till now.</p>
                <p>Elsewhere, for new boys Hyderabad, coming to terms with life in the league hasn’t been easy. The side have won just the singular match out for four with their three defeats coming courtesy of a paper thin defence, one which has seen the side persistently shrouded in an ordeal. With both the side’s falling out in the early stages itself, today’s match is a massive one for either, one where a win could up act as a defining moment in their resurgence and turnaround.</p>

                            </ul>
                            <h3>CFC vs HYD Dream11 Goal-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>We have decided to move in for Hyderabad’s Kamaljit Singh in this department of our Dream 1 setup. Although his side have been drubbed defensively, the side would have ended up conceding a slew of goals had it not been for the shot stoppers performances, ones we see him emulating come today’s contest as well.</p>
                            <h3>CFC vs HYD Dream11 Defenders</h3>
                            <p>Up against a side who have failed to string together a single goal till now in the league, the likelihood of this being a cleansheet for Hyderabad is very high. The side are up against a unit which has been lacklustre and lopsided in attack, a discourse which will buoy Hyderabad in their quest of furthering the side’s impasse come today.</p>
                            <p>It leads us towards a duo of picks from the side with us deciding to venture in with Gurtej Singh and Matthew Kilgallon for this one. Meanwhile, we are also picking up the two defenders from Chennaiyin with Hyderabad themselves having floundered infront of goal and with Chennaiyin relying on their defensive acumen first and foremost to help salvage something from this contest.</p>
                            <p>Our deliberations lead us towards the selection of two of their most articulate defender with the duo of Eli Sabia and Lucian Goian making an advent into our side for this imminent clash.</p>
                            <h3>CFC vs HYD Dream11 Midfielders</h3>
                            <p>Hyderabad’s top scorer with the tow goals till now, Marcelinho Leite Pereira was always going to be a must have player for this encounter. If his side are going to return from this match unscathed and speckle free, they’ll be requiring the services of Pereira to be at their fore and with the player pummelling the opposition with his expansive skill set.</p>
                            <p>With one goal till now, Marko Stankovic will partner him up for the day while our du from the other side comes in the form of Dragos Firtulescu and Rafael Lopez, two players who have looked the most promising and enterprising in the side’s attacking rummages.</p>
                            <h3>CFC vs HYD Dream11 Strikers</h3>
                            <p>The one striker apiece from either side will be lining up our Dream 11 unit to bring an end to our proceedings with us beginning with Giles Barnes for this one. Elsewhere from Chennaiyin we have decided to bring in Nerijus Valskis, a player who has been devoid of goals till now but up against a unit who has leaked 10 goals till now, this might just be the match for him to torch the field up.</p>
                            <h3>CFC vs HYD Dream11 Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Pereira leads us out as the unit’s captain whilst Stankovic is our vice-captain.</p>
