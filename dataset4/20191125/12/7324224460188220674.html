      <h2>A key test of Labour’s popularity in the East Midlands</h2>

      <p>Derbyshire North East, which Jeremy Corbyn visited on Monday, is one of half a dozen Conservative constituencies in the East Midlands that Labour is targeting in this election.</p>
      <p>It used to be one of Labour’s safest seats in the region, and was held by the party continuously from 1935 until 2017.</p>
      <p>Then Lee Rowley won it for the Conservatives on a swing of nearly 5%.</p>
      <p>Labour’s majority in the seat had dwindled since the 2010 general election, so victory for the Tories in 2017 was not unexpected.</p>
      <p>But Mr Rowley is defending a majority of only 2,861, and Labour would need a swing of just under 3% to defeat him.</p>

      <p>This is the sort of constituency Labour has to win if it wants to become the largest party in a hung parliament – never mind forming a majority government.</p>
      <p>If it manages to take Derbyshire North East, Labour could be in line to pick up other Tory-held marginal seats in the East Midlands, such as Mansfield, Corby and Loughborough.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the party could under-perform in the region and fail to make any gains, besides losing seats to the Conservatives such as Ashfield and Lincoln.</p>
      <p>Both Mr Corbyn and Boris Johnson have visited the region during the campaign – and would be wise to do so again.</p>
      <p>Four parties are standing in Derbyshire North East at this election: Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and Green.</p>
