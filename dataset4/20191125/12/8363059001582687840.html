      <h1>Nokia is Teasing a New Phone to Be Revealed Next Month</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:30:55+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>Nokia will be announcing a new smartphone to close out the year that will be unveiled on December 5.</p>
      <p>The impending announcement was teased via the company's <a href="https://twitter.com/NokiaMobile/status/1197877461356122113">official Twitter account</a> with a brief video that has diddly squat to do with a handset. The stylised clip shows an outdoorsy type running through a mountain range, scaling cliff faces, and generally having a whale of a time, before it cuts to roiling clouds and sneakily flashes the outline of the mystery phone.</p>

      <p>It was around this time last year that Nokia launched its 8.1 smartphone, so best guesses are on a follow up in the form of the 8.2. Then again, just last week we saw reportedly leaked images (via <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/tip-nokia-9-1-pureview-dummy-images-claimed-with-case-emerge/">Nokiapoweruser</a>) of the Nokia 9.1 PureView, the next iteration of the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/01/leaked-5-camera-nokia-9-pureview-trypophobia/">absolute worst smartphone</a> to get for someone with even the mildest hint of trypophobia. The phone is rumoured to house the Snapdragon 855 chipset, sport five cameras just like its predecessor, and will run Android 10 out of the box.</p>
      <p>Or it could be something else entirely unexpected. We don't have long wait, as the Nokia Mobile Live event is set for next week. [<a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/nokia-teases-a-new-phone-for-a-december-5-launch">TechRadar</a>]</p>
