      <p>Irish Water advises customers that essential upgrade works are scheduled to take place at Staleen Water Treatment Plant from 9am until 5pm on Tuesday 26 November. During these essential works the water supply to homes and businesses in south Louth and east Meath will be dependent on storage in the reservoirs. The storage available in the reservoirs should be adequate to maintain water supply for the duration of the necessary works. Irish Water is encouraging customers to conserve water while these essential works are underway. We are urging customers to conserve water by; not running taps needlessly, taking showers instead of baths and to postpone using dishwashers and washing machines where possible. Following the completion of the works at the plant it may take a number of hours for normal water supply to resume for all customers.</p>
      <p>Irish Water is working closely with Louth and Meath County Councils to minimise any potential impact on customers, however some customers in east Meath may experience disruption to their supply following these works. </p>
      <p>It may be necessary to place restrictions on the supply for customers in Donore. Restrictions may also be required in Ratoath, Ashbourne, Curragha, Kilbride and surrounding areas. These restrictions may be necessary in order to allow water levels in Windmill Hill Reservoir to recover following the works and to ensure a normal water supply during business hours on Wednesday 27 November.</p>
      <p>Works to upgrade the Staleen Water Treatment Plant have been ongoing since September 2017 and are scheduled to be completed in Q4 2019. The upgraded water treatment plant will ensure that the water supply is removed from the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) Remedial Action List (RAL) and will safeguard the water supply to homes and businesses served by the plant.</p>
      <p>Irish Water would like to advise customers that as the upgrade works are nearing completion there will be further instances, when the production capacity at the plant may be reduced to accommodate these essential works. Irish Water will provide notice in advance of any potential supply interruption associated with these upgrade works. Notice will be provided to all Louth and Meath media outlets and issued to elected representatives. Information will also be provided via <a href="http://www.water.ie/">www.water.ie</a> and Irish Water’s social media channels. </p>
      <p>The upgrade to the water treatment plant forms part of a wider Irish Water investment of €19 million in the Drogheda, South Louth and East Meath Water Supply Scheme. This significant investment also included the construction of a new 2km pipeline to replace the watermain which burst twice in a year. Irish Water commenced works on the pipeline in April 2018 and it was completed in December 2018, minimising the risk of future bursts. </p>
      <p>The upgraded water treatment plant coupled with the new pipeline and other smaller projects that are being delivered by Irish Water will ensure the delivery of a safe, secure and reliable water supply to homes and businesses in Drogheda, South Louth and East Meath. </p>
      <p>Irish Water would like to thank customers for their patience during these essential works. For further information please visit the supply and service section on www.water.ie. The Irish Water customer care helpline is open 24/7 and customers can call us on 1850 278 278 and contact us on Twitter @IWCare.<br/> </p>
