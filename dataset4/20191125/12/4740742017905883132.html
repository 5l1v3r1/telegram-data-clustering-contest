      <h1>'Non-starter' - What Bristol City, Leeds United and Aston Villa are saying about Liverpool striker set for loan</h1>
      <h2>He is set to depart Anfield in January</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:46:13+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:46</time> by <a rel="author">David Byrom</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool are set to allow Rhian Brewster to leave the club on loan in January.</p>
      <p>Game time has been limited for the 19-year-old this season, with the striker managing just two appearances in the EFL Cup.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> have long been linked with the highly-rated starlet, but <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">the Robins</a> face plenty of competition for his signature.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-set-allow-striker-linked-3574200">Leeds United and Aston Villa are the latest clubs to be credited with an interest in Brewster</a>, although Swansea City and Crystal Palace are also said to be monitoring his situation.</p>
      <p>Here is what fans of <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City,</a> Liverpool, Leeds and Aston Villa are saying about the deal.</p>
      <h3>Bristol City</h3>

      <p><b>Darren Boddy:</b> Bring Brewster in on loan. He will most certainly help our season.</p>
      <p><b>David Lamb:</b> We need a striker so why not him?</p>
      <p><b>Vincenzo Ruffino:</b> Off he goes to Leeds then or one of the other top four clubs.</p>
      <h3>Liverpool</h3>
      <p><b>Malaysian Kopites:</b> We need some back-up players, it's not advisable to loan him.</p>
      <p><b>Fun Crusher:</b> Brewster out (for first-team experience only) Werner in. Perfection.</p>
      <p><b>Jamie Jenner:</b> He needs Premier League experience at one of the lower-half teams.</p>
      <p><b>Dushan:</b> No chance he'd make it into a Premier League XI, even at Norwich.</p>
      <p><b>TWT Liverpool:</b> In my opinion, I really hope that Klopp managed to loan Brewster to clubs abroad like Bundesliga as an example. Considering there are some English players who are impressive when they are loaned/bought by the clubs there like Sancho and Nelson. I do believe that Brewster has a great potential.. but he surely needs game time to prove himself.</p>
      <p><b>Arfixgwar:</b> Guaranteed first-team game time is needed for Rhian to develop further. If a loan move can provide that development for him, then it's a good option.</p>
      <p><b>AM:</b> Go to Leeds with Bielsa.</p>
      <p><b>Milhan Chungh:</b> Championship loan would be better. He would get more gametime. Swansea would be perfect.</p>
      <p><b>The Wool:</b> Looks like Rhian Brewster could be heading out on loan for the second half of the season. Makes sense because he isn't getting anywhere near our first eleven.</p>
      <p><b>Angry Leftie:</b> He needs games, the starts he had nothing's clicked for him, its not an issue he's so young, three to four months playing in the Championship would do him the world of good.</p>
      <p><b>Dogstar:</b> I'd sooner him go to Leeds or Swansea, at least if he's going somewhere else I'd rather him play attacking football.</p>
      <p><b>Keith:</b> Swansea would be a good place for him. Knows the coach and would probably get most game time.</p>
      <h3>Leeds United</h3>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Nige:</b> Leeds are desperate to sign Liverpool's Rhian Brewster on loan, Palace and Villa also interested but the interest shows MB wants a striker. Does that mean Eddie is leaving?</p>
      <p><b>Cal Unchained:</b> He's not coming to us.</p>
      <p><b>Back Again:</b> He'd only go to Leeds if Nkeitah goes back (we have too many loans at the moment). So he'd be second choice and might break into the team.</p>
      <p><b>Joe Wainman:</b> Rhian Brewster definitely having some of that!</p>
      <p><b>Lee Cox:</b> Aim higher.</p>
      <p><b>Brewza Boy:</b> Nketiah is better than Brewster.</p>
      <h3>Aston Villa</h3>
      <p><b>Nick:</b> Big gamble if it were to happen with such a lack of experience but stranger things have happened at Villa Park!</p>
      <p><b>Wayne:</b> No thanks, not proven.</p>
      <p><b>Davo:</b> We need an experienced striker that’s actually played and scored goals. Brewster isn’t that.</p>
      <p><b>Andy Marshall:</b> We aren't going to train up other clubs' players without an option to buy and there's no way Liverpool give us an option. Non starter this.</p>
      <p><b>Joe Smith:</b> Not enough experience in actually playing.</p>
      <p><b>Get Comboed:</b> Would love Brewster.</p>
