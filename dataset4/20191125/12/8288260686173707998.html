      <h2>Aston Villa v Newcastle United | Dean Smith opens up about the man he replaced, Steve Bruce, while discussing what was needed in order to get Villa promoted to the Premier League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Preece, https://www.facebook.com/PreeceBirminghamLive/</a></address>
      <p>Dean Smith has labelled the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> supporter who hurled a giant cabbage at Steve Bruce 13 months ago "a disgrace".</p>
      <p>Bruce makes his long-awaited return to his former office for tonight's Monday Night Football encounter between Villa and Newcastle at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>Prior to Villa's 3-3 draw with bottom-club Preston last October, Bruce was subjected to what was known as cabbage-gate after a supporter managed to roll the large vegetable towards the Geordie boss in protest. Bruce was sacked the following day before being replaced by Smith.</p>

      <p>"I thought it was a disgrace," fumed the Villa boss ahead of facing off against the man he replaced. "You don't want to see that in the ground. I said that at the time.</p>
      <p>"I was just embarrassed for the person who was bringing a cabbage in there."</p>
      <p>As for Smith, the Villa chief admitted the side he took over from Bruce "had good players" - but last January was key to getting his side promoted.</p>

      <h3>What reception should Steve Bruce get from the Villa Park faithful on Monday?</h3>
      <h4>500+ VOTES SO FAR</h4>
      <p>Applause Boo him to the rafters Ignore him completely - we're better off now</p>
      <p>The Villa boss, when asked about tweaks made to Bruce's squad, said: "I only had about seven players (for first training session) because everyone was on international duty. I didn't see Tammy Abraham until the day before the Swansea game. They were all away.</p>
      <p>"But they were all good players we had. What we had to do was add to the squad in January because we were struggling defensively. Axel Tuanzebe and James Chester were the only fit centre-halves and James was struggling up until January.</p>

      <p>There's been some lowlights, and a smattering of highlights from January 2010 to now - and we'll bring you a host of them here.</p>

      <p>"We managed to get Kortney Hause and Tyrone Mings in. It certainly helped us."</p>
      <p>Ahead of tonight's match-up, Smith said of 14th-placed Newcastle: "I watched their game with West Ham and they were outstanding in their counter-attacking. They went 3-0 up and it could have been five or six, such is the pace and power they've got in their team. They've got a really good organisation as well. Tough to break down but a real threat on the counter.</p>
      <p>"But you've always got to show a bit of patience. The key for us is making to move the ball quick enough."</p>
