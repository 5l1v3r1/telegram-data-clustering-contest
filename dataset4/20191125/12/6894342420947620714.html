      <h1>Huawei Y9s Will Retail For RM999; Available Starting 29 November</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:30:45+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/john/" target="_blank">John Law</a></address>
      <p>Almost a day after information about the Huawei Y9s made its way online, its local pricing has finally made its way online. Thanks to Amanz, we now know that the phone will retail at an SRP of RM999, and will be available from 29 November onwards.</p>
      <p>To recap, the Y9s features a 6.59-inch Full HD+ notchless display, and is powered by a Kirin 710F SoC, along with 6GB RAM. In terms of storage, the phone comes with 128GB of expandable storage. Moving on, the phone also comes with a side-mounted fingerprint scanner.</p>
      <p>Camera-wise, the Y9s features a triple-camera main array, comprising a 48MP f/1.8 main camera, an 8MP f/2.4 ultra-wide, and a 2MP depth sensor. The 16MP selfie camera has been shifted as well and now hides at the top of the phone as a motorised pop-up selfie.</p>

      <p>Hardware aside, one of the more important criteria of the Y9s is that, like the <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/199657/honor-9x-hands-on-taking-a-step-back-for-google/">HONOR 9X</a>, the phone ships out with Google Mobile Services (GMS) pre-installed on the phone. Again, and like the HONOR 9X, how it is able to circumvent the US ban is due to the Kirin 710F SoC.</p>
