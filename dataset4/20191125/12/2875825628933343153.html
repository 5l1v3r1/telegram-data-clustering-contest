      <p>Phillip Schofield has blasted last night's live I'm A Celebrity bushtucker trial, hinting that it was "fixed".</p>
      <p>Last night, almost all of the celebrities had to take part in the live trial, which saw them down gross 'shakes', hunt for stars and have wriggling creepie crawlies dumped on them.</p>
      <p>For every star they won, they would win a roast dinner for a campmate. Earlier they had arranged everyone in order of who would win a meal.</p>
      <p>Despite breezing through most of the tasks, James and Roman struggled with the last one and failed to get the final three stars.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>This meant that Ian, Cliff and Andy would not be getting a roast dinner that evening, prompting fury from viewers who claimed that it was "impossible".</p>
      <p>Some have even started a petition to get football pundit Ian a meal as he struggles with hunger pains.</p>
      <p>And Phil added his voice to the discord, insisting that it wasn't possible for someone to do the trial in 90 seconds.</p>
      <p>Speaking to I'm A Celeb winner Toff and Stanley Johnson, he exclaimed: "The last one! It's not possible in 90 seconds!"</p>

      <p>However Toff insisted that And and Dec had said that it had been tried and tested and that it had been done.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Holly Wiloughby pointed out that Ian would be struggling because he was already showing signs of grumpiness.</p>
      <p>Family and friends looking after the football pundit's <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> shared a petition last night calling for Ian to get a roast dinner, writing: "We hearby endorse this petition. GIVE WRIGHTY A ROASTY! #ImACeleb #TeamIan."</p>
      <p>Fans flocked to Twitter to comment, with one commenting: "That last trial was pathetic and unfair, how were they supposed to unscrew and screw the stars when the crabs were in the way. The crabs were too big for the boxes. #farce."</p>
