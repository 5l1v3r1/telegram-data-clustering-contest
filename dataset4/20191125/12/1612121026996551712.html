      <p>If you thought the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345281-google-pixel-4-announcement/">Pixel 4 and 4 XL</a> were a little on the pricey side of things when they launched in October, you’ll be happy to note that you can save a massive $200 off each model as part of Google’s <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> promotion. This means that you’ll be able to pick up a 64GB Pixel 4 for just $599, and the 64GB version of the Pixel 4 XL for a much more reasonable $699. And if you want a <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/333332-googles-pixel-slate-is-another-take-on-the-tablet-market-running-chrome-os/">Pixel Slate</a> to go along with the new handset, there’s a $300 in savings to be had along with a free keyboard or Pixelbook pen.</p>
