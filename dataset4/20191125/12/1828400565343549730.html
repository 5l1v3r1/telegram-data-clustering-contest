      <p>Having struggled to find a sponsor, the 27-year-old has teamed up with train operating company who are backing her bid for glory in Tokyo next summer.</p>
      <p>Justine, who damaged her spinal cord in a fall from a tree, said: “Competing at the Paralympic Games means everything. It’s the pinnacle of my sport and there’s no better feeling than representing my country and the local community.</p>
      <p>“The free travel from Northern has come in super handy and soon it will take me to the other side of the world – although this part of the journey won’t be by train.</p>
      <p>“I’m proud to represent Great Britain and Blackpool. To know that local people are behind me 100 percent makes all the hard work prior to Tokyo all the more worthwhile.”</p>

      <p>The wheelchair fencer was first introduced to the sport ten years ago at a junior camp at Stoke Mandeville and will go for Olympic gold next year in Japan.</p>
      <p>She took part in her first Paralympic Games at London 2012.</p>
      <p>British Transport Police’s John Phillips met the gold medal hopeful on her way to training and was instrumental in securing her a sponsorship with Northern.</p>
      <p>PC Phillips said: “I was saddened to hear that Justine was struggling for sponsorship support at a time when she has been working hard towards winning gold for Team GB.</p>
      <p>“We got talking as I was helping her through the barriers with her wheelchair and kit, and I decided that I’d try my best to make things a bit easier for her.</p>
      <p>“I got in touch with Northern about sponsorship and luckily they came through for her.”</p>
      <p>Chris Jackson, Regional Director for Northern said: “We’re very proud to be able to support Justine as she prepares to compete for Great Britain at the Paralympics.</p>
      <p>She’s an unbelievable athlete – proven by her haul of medals – and we wish her the best of luck as she competes on the world stage.”</p>
