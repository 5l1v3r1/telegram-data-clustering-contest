      <h2>Staff at four Liverpool universities are striking for eight days</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:17:59+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/max-clements/" target="_blank">Max Clements</a></address>
      <p>Staff at four Merseyside universities have walked out today in a dispute over pay, contracts, working conditions, and pensions.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/university-of-liverpool">University of Liverpool</a> , Edge Hill University in Ormskirk, Liverpool Hope University in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/childwall">Childwall</a> and the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts (LIPA) are braced for eight days of industrial action across two weeks after university representatives failed to reach an agreement with the University and College Union (UCU).</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/staff-four-merseyside-universities-strike-17306676">The strike action</a> will last for eight days including all this week (November 25, 26, 27, 28, 29) and half of next week (December 2, 3 and 4).</p>
      <p>Picket lines were set up at the University of Liverpool on Mount Pleasant and outside the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts (LIPA) in a show of support for university staff.</p>
      <p>Last month UCU members voted for strike action over changes to universities' pension schemes and over pay and contract disputes.</p>

      <p>The strike means many students are facing disruptions to their studies as lectures and tutorials and cancelled with no plans to reschedule the lost contact time.</p>
      <p>This new strike action comes less than two years after universities across the country were brought to a standstill by two weeks over strikes over pension changes, in an unprecedented wave of industrial action across the higher education sector.</p>
      <p>After picketing at campuses across the city, a rally is planned for Tuesday afternoon that will start at 12pm at University Square on Brownlow Hill and Mount Pleasant which will march through the city centre to the Universities Superannuation Scheme headquarters at the Liver Building.</p>
      <p>A rally is scheduled on Tuesday that will be addressed by UCU general secretary Jo Grady and Labour MP candidates for Walton, Wavertree and West Derby Dan Carden, Paula Barker and Ian Byrne.</p>

      <p>Anthony O'Hanlon, branch president of the University and College Union at Liverpool University, said: "University staff are walking out over pay, job security, workloads, and changes to pensions. Staff are being placed on temporary contracts but in reality are working 40 to 50 hours a week under this exploitative model.</p>
      <p>"The way the universities have approached these negotiations has been totally disrespectful.</p>
      <p>"They refused to even discuss pay. There has been no real movement in negotiations which is very disappointing to us.</p>
      <p>"At Liverpool University, the pensions issue has been a longstanding dispute. Staff are now looking at a huge increase in pension contributions by 2020 while pay is being eroded at the same time.</p>
      <p>"What we want is meaningful negotiations with the universities and an offer which meets the reasonable demands of staff given the financial wealth enjoyed by our higher education sector.</p>

      <p>"There are staff walking out at 60 higher education institutions across the country and we hope that this will send a strong message out to universities across the UK and that employers will make meaningful efforts to negotiate.</p>
      <p>"The ball is in their court and they must now put something serious on the table for our members. We haven't seen that."</p>
      <p>UCU has also announced that its members will be taking other action alongside the strike which it describes as 'action short of strike'.</p>
      <p>This involves members working strictly to contract, refusing to cover for absent colleagues and refusing to reschedule lectures that were lost due to the strike action.</p>
      <p>UCU said that it feared universities had learned nothing from last year's pension dispute, which saw university staff walk out across the country.</p>

      <p>A spokespersonÂ  for Liverpool Hope University said: "We can confirm that The University &amp; College Union has given formal notice that they will be encouraging their members to participate in the planned national industrial action, including both full strike action and action short of strike.</p>
      <p>"They are striking over a national pay offer.</p>
      <p>"All pay withheld from those taking industrial action will be allocated to activities that support students affected by the strike and we will continue to allocate resources over the course of the next few months as the work to mitigate industrial action continues.</p>
      <p>"The university is committed to care of its students, both academically and pastorally, in particular ensuring that student opportunities for learning are as disrupted as little as possible.</p>
      <p>"Wherever possible, teaching session will run during the period of the industrial action.</p>
      <p>"Where this is not possible replacement learning opportunities will be offered following the industrial action.</p>
      <p>"The university has contacted all of its students individually and provided information on the university's student website."</p>
