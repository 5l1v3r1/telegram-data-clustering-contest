      <p>It comes in response to star Kristofer Hivju’s revelation last week that they <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/alternate-game-thrones-finale-shot-says-cast-member-2570229">had shot a second ending</a> to the series.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>“Well, we shot an alternative ending,” the Tormund Giantsbane actor said at a Q&amp;A. “That was mostly for fun but I don’t know if I’m allowed to tell you about that.”</p>
      <p>Chapman, who played Tommen Baratheon on the HBO series until 2016, has now backed calls to release the alternate ending, telling <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/23/game-of-thrones-tommen-dean-charles-chapman-alternate-ending/"><i>TMZ</i></a> when quizzed on a possible release: “Yeah, why not”.</p>
      <p>When the interviewer suggested it could be to “see what it’s about”, the actor responded: “Yeah exactly. I know they’re doing spin-offs as well…”.</p>

      <p>The interviewer then argued it could “mend the fans’ hearts”, Chapman adding: “Exactly… I’ll be watching”.</p>
      <p>The show’s ending proved very divisive when it aired earlier this year, with show director Neil Marshall admitting the finale was <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/game-of-thrones-finale-was-really-rushed-admits-director-2556942">“really rushed”</a>.</p>

      <p>However, Alfie Allen revealed he was <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/game-of-thrones-star-alfie-allen-was-pissed-off-by-finale-backlash-2540758">“pissed off”</a> by the backlash, adding: “I can’t even delve into that world too much, for my own sanity.”</p>
