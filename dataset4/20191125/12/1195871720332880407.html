        <p>Luckily, you have a choice of either the black or red models and both have this same big saving. The Garmin Forerunner 45 follows one of Garmin's most popular running watches in the form of the Forerunner 35.</p>
        <p>While it had a lot to live up to, we were massively impressed by Garmin's new budget running watch option, awarding it 4/5 in our <a href="https://www.wareable.com/garmin/garmin-forerunner-45-review-7333">Forerunner 45 review</a>.</p>

          <p>It manages to pack in an awful lot of features for its price point, including functionality not previously seen on the Forerunner 35. You get some basic smartwatch functionality, too, including notification mirroring.</p>

          <p>Of course, it includes the fundamentals of any good running watch in the form of built-in GPS and a heart rate monitor, but extra features like VO2 Max are also welcomely present.</p>
          <p>The biggest change from the Forerunner 35 is a much more attractive svelte and round design. It leaves the Forerunner 35 looking even boxier and more old-fashioned. Our review concluded: "The Garmin Forerunner 45 is a brilliant budget watch that offers more detail and better performance than anything else in its price bracket.</p>
          <p>You’d struggle to pick up ageing generations of rival watches for less, and Garmin has relentlessly added top-end features across its lineup, with this Forerunner benefitting hugely."</p>
          <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
          <p>Considering you can now pick one up for a record low price, it's an even stronger recommendation for anyone on a tight budget.</p>
