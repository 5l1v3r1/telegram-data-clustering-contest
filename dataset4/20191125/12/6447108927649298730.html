      <h1>Destiny 2 is getting a cook book so you can make actual rice cakes for actual bunnies</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:21:45+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:21</time> by <a rel="author">Tuffcub</a></address>
      <p>Food does not feature heavily in the Destiny universe. There is a Ramen bar in the Tower, famously frequented by Cade 6 before he was killed off, but you cannot sit down and have some nosh. There are a few other items of food in the game, notably a bowl of something that smells faintly of mint and some rice cakes, but these are for cats and bunnies rather than humans.</p>
      <p>That hasn’t stopped Victoria Rosenthal from writing a cook book based on the game. Her previous work includes the Fallout Official Cookbook, but at least there is cooking mechanic in that series. The Destiny cook book features recipes captured by witch-in-hiding and purveyor of candy, Eva Levante, here is the official blurb from Amazon.</p>
      <blockquote>Explore recipes inspired by Bungie’s hit franchise in Destiny: The Official Cookbook.<br/>Based on Bungie’s acclaimed video game series Destiny, this official cookbook is filled with recipes inspired by the Guardians and locations seen throughout the game’s expansive universe.<br/><br/>Eva Levante has traveled around the world after the events of the Red War, gathering a variety of recipes after crossing paths with many Guardians along the way and learning from their adventures. Craft, mouthwatering food from her diverse list of recipes inspired by the game’s unique world, plus step-by-step instructions and full-color photos, help guide and inspire fans to go on their own culinary adventure through the solar system.<br/><br/>Perfect for all Hunters, Titans, and Warlocks, Destiny: The Official Cookbook is packed with amazing recipes and stories that celebrate Destiny’s vast multiplayer universe.</blockquote>

      <p>The 192 page hardcover book will launch on 4th August 2020, so there is a bit of a wait, and will set you back £27.27 if you pre-order it from Amazon. As you can see from the image above, fried chicken has a connection to Destiny and I am sure it will be a totally rational link and not something like “Before he served The Nine the mysterious Xur used to work in KFC, here is his recipe for crispy wings!”</p>
