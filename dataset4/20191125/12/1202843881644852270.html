      <p><b>Wellington </b> - England fast bowler Jofra Archer said on Monday he was subjected to racial insults by a spectator while batting during the final day of the opening test against New Zealand at Bay Oval.</p>
      <p>New Zealand cruised to an innings and 65-run win over England to take a 1-0 lead in the two-match series.</p>
      <p>Archer scored 30 and combined in a 59-run partnership for the ninth wicket with Sam Curran to delay the hosts' victory.</p>
      <p>"A bit disturbing hearing racial insults today whilst battling to help save my team, the crowd has been amazing this week except for that one guy," the 24-year-old said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Archer, who was born in Barbados and represented West Indies at Under-19 level, has been fast-tracked into the England side and made an impressive test debut during the Ashes series against Australia.</p>
      <p>According to protocol, International Cricket Council-appointed match referee Javagal Srinath of India is expected to mention the incident in his match report to the world governing body.</p>
      <p>New Zealand Cricket said the security providers at the venue were unable to locate the perpetrator and the board will apologise to Archer.</p>
      <p>"NZC will be examining CCTV footage and making further inquiries tomorrow in an endeavour to identify the man responsible," it said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"NZC has zero tolerance towards abusive or offensive language at any of its venues and will refer any developments in the case to police.</p>
      <p>"It will contact Mr Archer tomorrow to apologise for the unacceptable experience, and to promise increased vigilance in the matter when the teams next meet in Hamilton."</p>
      <p>The second test starts in Hamilton from Friday.</p>
