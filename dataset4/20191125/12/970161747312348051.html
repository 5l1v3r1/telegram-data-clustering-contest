      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> legend Peter Schmeichel has serious reservations over the side’s current midfield and has called on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nemanja-matic/">Nemanja Matic</a> to come back into the team.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils gave a lethargic display for 70 minutes of Sunday’s 3-3 draw with Sheffield United, going two goals behind, but rallied in a frantic 10-minute spell to take the lead – though the hosts nabbed a deserved equaliser late on.</p>
      <p>Schmeichel felt United missed the injured Scott McTominay, with the side’s reliance on the midfielder another issue, and wants to see Matic – who has not played since September – restored.</p>

      <p>‘They needed a player like Matic today, just to sit in that defensive midfield role and just calm things down,’ Schmeichel told the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a>.</p>

      <p>‘He’s been criticised for being slow and playing the ball backwards too many times, but sometimes they needed that in this game.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘I like Fred, but he definitely needs somebody strong, somebody that can control him.</p>
      <p>‘You want to talk about where Man United are in this evolving period, but just the fact that Scott McTominay is not there is a problem.’</p>
      <p>Owen Hargreaves, who was also in the studio, chimed in: ‘A midfield of Fred and [Andreas] Pereira, that’s not good enough at this level, sadly.’</p>
      <p>After the match, Marcus Rashford – who scored one and created another – said the draw was a deserved result, though Schmeichel feels with further reflection the striker will realise Sheffield United were the better side.</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘One thing is to actually play the game, how you see it and how you feel it. He will remember the last bit of the game and maybe take that over more minutes.</p>

      <p>‘I think if he watches it back I think he’ll change his mind a little bit. They didn’t exploit the little pockets of space before very late in the game. But full credit to them for carrying on and continuing to believe it and just waiting for that one opportunity that came in the 72nd minute.</p>

      <p>‘From then on, I actually said it was going to be five because it was that kind of game when you’re suddenly a team that takes over and then you can score more goals. But full credit to Sheffield United for coming back, it was a deserved point for them.’</p>
