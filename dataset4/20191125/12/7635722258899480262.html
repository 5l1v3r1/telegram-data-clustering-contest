        <b>Limerick inter-county hurler Richie McCarthy has announced his retirement from John Kiely's senior panel.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 32-year-old made his senior debut for the Treaty County in 2011 and picked up an All-Star award in 2013 as a full-back.</p>
      <p>McCarthy's other honours include Limerick's famous All-Ireland win in 2018, Munster senior winners' medals in 2013 and 2019, an Allianz Hurling League Division Two title in 2011 and Division One title in 2019.</p>
      <p>In a statement <a href="https://limerickgaa.ie/richie-mc-carthy-announces-inter-county-retirement/">released by Limerick GAA</a> today on behalf of McCarthy, the Blackrock man paid tribute to his teammates.</p>
      <p>“Today I am announcing my retirement from the Limerick Senior Hurling team. It has been an incredible 11 year journey but the time is right for me to now step away.</p>
      <p>"It is the greatest honour for any GAA player to wear their county colours but it has also been the wild dreams of a youngster from Kilfinane.</p>

      <p>"To all of my teammates who have worked so hard to achieve what we have achieved, all I can say is thank you, it has been a pleasure. I am left with many great memories including the greatest of all when I was able to lift the Liam McCarthy in front of Hill 16.</p>
      <p>"I would like to thank and acknowledge the immeasurable contribution of the many management, medical and backroom teams I have been with for over a decade as well as the help and support I received from the Limerick County Board.</p>
      <p>"Thank you also to my club Blackrock for your support and belief in me as a player."</p>
      <p>McCarthy, who missed the 2019 inter-county season due to a cruciate ligament injury, was also a member of the Limerick minor side that lost to Galway in the 2005 All-Ireland minor hurling final.</p>
      <p>He was also keen to stress his appreciation for the Limerick fans in his departing statement.</p>
      <p>"To the supporters of Limerick, I want to say a huge thank you. Your continued belief and support of us is everything that makes playing for Limerick so special.</p>
      <p>"Finally, to my family, my parents Henry and Ann and in particular my partner Ruth who have been an enormous support to me and who I owe so much to.</p>
      <p>"I would like to wish John, Declan and all the panel the very best for the coming year. I look forward to playing with Blackrock for many years to come.”</p>
