      <h1>CRISIL reaffirms ratings on Thomas Cook India at AA-minus, A1-plus</h1>
      <h2>On September 23, Thomas Cook Plc in Britain announced that it is filing for compulsory liquidation with immediate effect</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:16:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:16</time> by <a rel="author">ANI</a></address>
      <p>Thomas Cook India Ltd (TCIL) said on Monday that <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/crisil">Crisil </a>has reaffirmed its ratings on the debt programmes and bank facilities totalling Rs 739 crore.</p>
      <p>While long-term rating has been pegged at AA-minus with a stable outlook, the short-term rating has been classified as A1-plus. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/crisil">Crisil </a>has partially withdrawn the rating on short-term debt including commercial paper of Rs 50 crore as the company has not utilised it.</p>
      <p>On September 23, Thomas Cook Plc in Britain announced that it is filing for compulsory liquidation with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>While TCIL is a brand licensee of the Thomas Cook brand in India with brand licensing agreement valid until November 2024, it is a completely separate entity from TCPLC post-acquisition of a 77 per cent stake by Canada-based <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/fairfax-financial-holdings">Fairfax Financial Holdings </a>in 2012.</p>
      <p>There are no shareholding or business linkage between the two <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies.</a> "Hence, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/crisil">Crisil </a>believes the liquidation of the Britain-based entity should not have a material impact on TCIL's credit risk profile."</p>
      <p>Crisil said the group's financial flexibility is expected to remain healthy, given strong cash and equivalents in the foreign exchange and travel businesses, aided by the omni-channel business model with extensive outreach and absence of any major long-term debt and capital expenditure over the medium term.</p>
