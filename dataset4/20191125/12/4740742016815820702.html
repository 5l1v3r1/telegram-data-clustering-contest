      <h1>Exclusive: Bristol City midfielder set for early return from Derby County loan due to Wayne Rooney arrival</h1>
      <h2>The playmaker has lost his place in the Rams starting XI</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:55:57+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:55</time> by <a rel="author">James Piercy</a></address>
      <p>Jamie Paterson is set to make a return to <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> in January with Derby County ready to cut short his season-long loan, Bristol Live understands.</p>
      <p>Paterson made the surprise switch to Derby on August 8 but has been unable to make a consistent impact at Pride Park, starting five Championship games with a further five appearances off the bench.</p>
      <p>He was an unused substitute in Saturday's 1-0 win over Preston with Tom Lawrence preferred in the No10 position and Duane Holmes playing there in the previous fixture against Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>Admittedly with the Christmas fixture list, there is ample opportunity for Paterson to play his way back into Philip Cocu's long-term plans but Wayne Rooney's arrival has further complicated the situation.</p>
      <p>Rooney has begun working as a coach at Derby following his release from DC United and will be registered to play for the Rams from January 1, with the 34-year-old expected to be used as a withdrawn forward or playmaker.</p>
      <p>That creates a logjam in the position for Phillip Cocu and with the considerable hype around Rooney's arrival and need to play him when available, Paterson's first-team chances are likely to become increasingly limited.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Derby have been linked for a January move for out-of-favour Celtic winger Scott Sinclair who they failed to sign in the summer, which caused the Rams to turn to Paterson.</p>

      <p>It has always look an odd fit for the 27-year-old given his well-publicised Nottingham Forest allegiances and the fact he was known to be <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/how-lee-johnson-responsible-preventing-3573943">happy and settled at Bristol City</a>, with the move coming as a surprise for player and fans alike.</p>
      <p>Derby's intention to <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/full-lee-johnson-transcript-bristol-3572809">send Paterson back to BS3</a> gives head coach Lee Johnson the option to either re-integrate him into his first-team squad or negotiate a sale.</p>
      <p>City won't be able to find a new loan club for Paterson as he came on for 27 minutes against Leeds on August 4 and EFL regulations state a player cannot play for three EFL clubs in one season.</p>
      <p>There has been previous tension between player and coach but Johnson still values Paterson's attributes as a footballer with the 27-year-old a supremely-gifted individual who does a bring a certain x-factor to the team.</p>
      <p>However, with Kasey Palmer, Callum O'Dowda, Niclas Eliasson and Sammie Szmodics, City are well-stocked in terms of wingers and central playmakers.</p>
      <p>The return to fitness of Korey Smith and Adam Nagy joining Josh Brownhill and Han-Noah Massengo in central midfield, also further limits Paterson's chances in a deeper role.</p>
      <p>Plus there is the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/how-lee-johnson-responsible-preventing-3573943">potential that Joe Morrell</a> or Liam Walsh could be <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/players-who-could-save-bristol-3555031">recalled from their loans</a> at Lincoln City and Coventry City, respectively, to further boost City's options.</p>
      <p>Paterson is under contract until summer 2021 which means he still carries considerable transfer value and would prove an enticing option for a Championship team willing to invest in an experienced No10 or winger who is approaching his peak.</p>
