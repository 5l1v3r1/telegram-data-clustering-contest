      <h2>Spurs take on Olympiacos in the Champions League on Tuesday night knowing a win would seal qualification to the knockout stages of the competition</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:06:59+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:06</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>New Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho appeared before the cameras on the training ground ahead of the Champions League clash with Olympiacos.</p>
      <p>Cameras were allowed onto the training ground at Hotspur Way for a 15-minute open session and they saw Mourinho, less than a week into his new job, spend time with all three groups of players - those who played at the weekend, those that were not involved and the goalkeepers.</p>
      <p>He again seemed in a good mood, exchanging pleasantries with some foreign journalists and sharing jokes with the staff.</p>
      <p>Spurs fans will be encouraged to see Tanguy Ndombele and Jan Vertonghen in training after the two were ruled out of the weekend's win against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> with injury, while Harry Kane was also present despite suffering a knock in the game.</p>

      <p>Mourinho was delighted after his reign Spurs got off the perfect start on Saturday with the 3-2 victory over the Hammers at the London Stadium, their first away win in the Premier League since January.</p>
      <p>Goals from Heung-Min Son, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane gave Spurs a convincing lead, before Michail Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna restored some pride for the Hammers.</p>
      <p>Mourinho will be desperate to win his first home game at the club, with victory sealing Spurs' place in the last-16 of the Champions League.</p>

      <p>After the victory against West Ham Mourinho said: "It was very very important. 11 months without music in the away dressing room, without a smile or happiness. They did it. I am very happy for them and with them. If someone only saw the result they'd have thought it was very difficult for us.</p>
      <p>But it was probably closer to a 4-0 than 3-1. I think my players paid the price of a very difficult week. International break, change of manager, new guy, different training sessions.</p>
      <p>"We have a game in two days. I think we can go and win that match at home and qualify in the Champions League and I think the mood becomes high for the boys."</p>
