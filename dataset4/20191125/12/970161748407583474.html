        <b>The internet lost their collective minds when Ms Banks shared a snap of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/prince-harry-works-friendly-charm-ms-banks-meet-royal-albert-hall-11176242/">her and </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-harry/">Prince Harry</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/prince-harry-works-friendly-charm-ms-banks-meet-royal-albert-hall-11176242/"> chilling at the OnSide Youth Zones awards</a> show at the Royal Albert Hall.</b>

      <p>Ms Banks, who happened to be performing on 18 November, had a surprise drop in from the Duke of Sussex and the two ended up looking like besties.</p>
      <p>However, many fans of the Bad B Bop rapper were annoyed at the artists’ caption, which happened to be: ‘I met Prince Harry today, you know he’s one of us lol’.</p>
      <p>Many didn’t appreciate the musician jokingly calling the Duke ‘one of us’, but Ms Banks doesn’t have time for that negativity, with some saying: ‘that caption was unnecessary.’</p>
      <p>One user even commented: ‘He’s a cool guy but the brudda ain’t one of us.’</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old <b>told Metro.co.uk</b>: ‘People take it too far. I’m obviously not saying he isn’t the colour he is.</p>

      <p>‘I’m not saying he’s a black man. But you can tell he has respect for our people. That’s the vibe I got anyways, lots of good vibes.</p>

      <p>‘You can always tell the difference when you meet people.’</p>
      <p>During the awards show, Harry delivered a speech addressing mental health while presenting the health and wellbeing award.</p>
      <p>Praising Greta Thunberg, 16, for bravely campaigning for action on climate change, the Duke said: ‘She may have been just one person at the beginning, but she had a belief, a mission, and a desire to do something not just for herself but for everyone, and now – the whole world is paying attention.</p>
      <p>‘Whatever your dream – every country, every community, every school, every friendship group, every family needs their own Greta – someone who can lead the way, someone who is prepared to stand up for what they believe, and show how much they care for the people in their lives and the community around them.’</p>
      <p>Not only is Prince Harry and Ms Banks now the duo we never knew we needed, the Duke is also a humanitarian and loving husband.</p>
      <p>It’s no surprise the Prince left the Snack rapper star struck.</p>
      <p>‘I was super chill,’ she explained. ‘I really didn’t realise how much of a big deal it would be. He’s royalty but I literally watched him since I was young so I thought I already knew him.</p>

      <p>‘He was very interested in my background and what I do and he made me feel very welcome. I think I was star struck towards the end though…’</p>
