          <b>WARNING: The following contains major spoilers for the latest episode of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/watchmen-tv/">Watchmen</a>, "This Extraordinary Being," which aired Sunday on HBO.</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>The original <i>Watchmen</i> comic book by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons began with a murder mystery. The entire premise was sparked by the murder of Eddie Blake, aka The Comedian, a former member of the Watchmen superhero team who was killed by a mysterious assailant. Throughout the 12-issue limited series, Rorschach, Nite Owl and Silk Specter searched for this killer, whose identity would only come in the comic's penultimate issue. As it turned out, it was a fellow former Watchmen Ozymandias, who killed Blake as part of his overarching plan to achieve world peace.</p>

      <p>Although HBO's <i>Watchmen</i> television series takes place 30 years after the events of the comic, it also began in a familiar tone: with the murder of someone with close ties to the series' main characters. Judd Crawford, the Chief of Police of Tulsa, Oklahoma, was found dead by Angela Abar, hanged from a tree. The only suspect in the case was Will Reeves, Angela's grandfather, who confessed to the crime despite being over 100 years old and wheelchair-bound.</p>

      <p>Ever since the death of Crawford, the search for his real killer has been driving the story forward. Now, in the series' latest episode, "This Extraordinary Being," the killer is finally revealed... and it was the man who confessed in the first place: Will Reeves.</p>

      <p><i>Watchmen</i>'s previous episode, "Little Fear of Lightning," ended with Angela consuming all of her grandfather's Nostalgia pills, a drug that allows someone to relive old memories. Now, "This Extraordinary Being" takes place entirely in Angela's mind, as she relives the life of her grandfather, from his early days as a police officer in New York to his decision to become the masked hero known as Hooded Justice after getting brutally beaten and nearly killed by white supremacist police officers. As Hooded Justice, Will took on a group of Ku Klux Klan members known as the Cyclops, who used a combination of mesmerism and technology to violently turn the black community against itself.</p>
      <p>After a trial run at a movie theater, Will pieced the clues together and eliminated the Cyclops before they could do any more damage. Although he killed them and burned their warehouse down, he kept a mind-control projector as proof of their actions.</p>

      <p>However, Will would actually retrofit this projector into a flashlight... one he would use decades later to confront Judd Crawford. The memories show that, after his tires were slashed in <i>Watchmen</i>'s first episode, Crawford stepped out of his vehicle to find Will in his wheelchair. With his special flashlight, the former Hooded Justice was then able to take control of the mind of Tulsa's Chief of Police and convince him to hang himself.</p>

      <p>Will's murder of Crawford was driven by his neverending fight against white supremacists. As we learned in Episode 2, Crawford had a KKK uniform hidden in his closet, which was enough for Will to sentence him. However, it appears there's more to Crawford's story. He explains the Klan outfit belonged to his grandfather, and that he kept it as part of his family's legacy. It's certainly condemning to, but Crawford hints there's more to it than that. Unfortunately, Will drives him to hang himself before the full story can be revealed.</p>

      <p>The reveal is slightly different than the comic book, of course. In Moore and Gibbons' <i>Watchmen</i>, Ozymandias used brute force to kill The Comedian. However, in HBO's television series, the answer to the central murder mystery comes with a comic twist -- a mind-controlling flashlight.</p>
      <p><i>Developed by Damon Lindelof, HBO's </i>Watchmen<i>stars Jeremy Irons, Regina King, Don Johnson, Tim Blake Nelson, Jean Smart, Louis Gossett Jr., Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Tom Mison, James Wolk, Adelaide Clemens, Andrew Howard, Frances Fisher, Jacob Ming-Trent, Sara Vickers, Dylan Schombing, Lily Rose Smith and Adelynn Spoon. The series airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT.</i></p>
