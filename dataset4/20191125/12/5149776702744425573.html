      <h1>Brussels sprout ketchup launched by Nottingham company just in time for Christmas</h1>
      <h2>You're going to love it - or hate it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:52:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:52</time> by <a rel="author">Lynette Pinchess</a></address>
      <p>It could be foodie heaven - or hell, depending on which side of the fence you're on when it comes to Brussels sprouts.</p>
      <p>The most controversial part of the Christmas feast won't just be limited to the dinner plate thanks to a Nottingham producer taking the demand for sprouts to a whole new level.</p>
      <p>Condiment lovers will be able to add a dollop of Brussels sprout ketchup to a turkey sandwich or Boxing Day leftovers.</p>
      <p>Suitable for both vegetarians and vegans, it also works as a dipping sauce for festive canapés or as an accompaniment to a cheeseboard.</p>
      <p>The unique festive ketchup has been created by Nottingham-based producers Sauce Shop.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/sauce-shop-owners-road-global-3443199">Sauce Shop</a>, which started out in the kitchen of Pam and James Digva's home in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/thousands-fans-pints-trent-bridge-3569976">West Bridgford </a>before moving to an industrial unit in Sneinton, is known for creating flavoursome condiments using all-natural ingredients.</p>

      <p>Each bottle of the seasonal sprout ketchup will contain around 15 sprouts. The British Brussels sprout variety has been chosen for the bespoke recipe for its sweet, nutty flavour and has been blended with cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon to give the tasting notes of braised red cabbage.</p>
      <p>The limited edition sauce is only available on Amazon for £3 a bottle. It can be pre-ordered from today and will be shipped from next Monday, December 2.</p>
      <p>“Our mission has always been a pursuit of flavour, which can only be achieved using high-quality, natural ingredients,” said co-founder Pam Digva.</p>
      <p>“Our limited-edition Brussels Sprout Ketchup, which we’ve developed exclusively for <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/shopping/11-amazing-amazon-money-saving-3552980">Amazon</a>, is testament to the versatility of this highly nutritious, seasonal vegetable which has more vitamin C in one sprout than in an entire orange. It’s been a wonderful challenge to bring out the natural sweet, nutty flavour of the often misunderstood Brussels sprout and we’re very proud of our sauce.”</p>
      <p>James Bate, Amazon's director of grocery said: "We’re sure this delicious ketchup will change the minds of some of the humble sprout’s harsher critics and hope to see it added to festive feasts and slipped into Christmas stockings nationwide.”</p>
