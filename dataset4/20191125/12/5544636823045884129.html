      <p>Chelsea midfielder N’Golo Kante has revealed that he rejected a move to Paris Saint-Germain because he felt good at Chelsea and was settled at West London.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old has consistently been linked with a move to PSG over recent seasons.</p>
      <p>The French champions were said to be ready to launch a bid for the midfielder in July 2018 in wake of his impressive displays for France during their successful World Cup campaign in Russia.</p>
      <p>But Chelsea were reluctant to consider any offers for the player, who was likely to cost in excess of £100 million ($132m).</p>
      <p>Rather, the Blues offered Kante fresh terms worth around £260,000 a week in a bid to ward off potential suitors, with the player eventually signing a new five-year contract in November 2018, committing him to the club until the summer of 2023.</p>
      <p>That only temporarily put a stop to the rumours, with PSG reportedly ready to make a renewed bid to sign Kante over the summer.</p>
      <p>The former Leicester player admitted he had the opportunity to move to the French capital but insisted he was settled in London.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes we do not necessarily know where we want to go. But we know what we have. I know I was in Chelsea and I was good there,” he told Canal Plus.</p>
      <p>“If I did not want to come to PSG it was more a sporting choice. I felt good in London, in the project and I was happy to stay there.”</p>
