      <h2>Late goal beats Brewers but again their own chances go begging</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:12:55+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:12</time> by <a rel="author">Colston Crawford</a></address>
      <p>Nigel Clough felt Burton Albion had been the better team against Peterorough United but they left with nothing to show for it after Joe Ward’s spectacular stoppage time volley gave Posh a 1-0 win.</p>
      <p>“It was very harsh on us to lose a game which we controlled almost from start to finish, especially in the first half,” said Clough. “It was a very composed, disciplined performance in the first half.</p>
      <p>“We controlled it and created numerous opportunities but we didn’t get that goal and then we leave ourselves open to somebody putting another screamer in, which seems to be happening to us with alarming regularity at the moment. Most of the time, those shots will find the stand but they seem to be going in the back of the net against us.”</p>

      <p>Clough was referring also to the equaliser hit from 25 yards by Richie Towell in the Brewers’ FA Cup first round tie away to Salford City.</p>
      <p>However, it is late goals conceded on the road that are also costing the Brewers – an equaliser for Portsmouth in a 2-2 draw and both an equaliser and a winner for Tranmere Rovers in a 2-1 defeat spring to mind. Once again, the Brewers’ big issue amounted to the inability to take their own chances, especially in the first half, against Peterborough.</p>
      <p>“We had two great chances early on,” said Clough.</p>
      <p>“Scott Fraser and John Brayford missed the target from inside the penalty area, then we put one across the face of the goal which Lucas Akins should finish but he’s inches away from it.</p>
      <p>“That was a brilliant run by Scott, who beat three or four players and put it across. A lot of those can be own goals, it can hit anybody and, somehow, it eluded everybody. That’s how it’s going for us at the moment.</p>
      <p>“It seems like feast or famine for us at the moment. The other night against Salford we scored some brilliant goals without creating 25 efforts on goal, then we couldn’t get one today. We should have been winning, not even drawing.</p>
      <p>“We dealt with pretty much everything they had to throw at us and Kieran O’Hara had very little to do, against a team who have scored so many goals.”</p>

      <p>After the first half ended goalless, Peterborough came out fired up after the break and, for 15 minutes, the Brewers were under pressure. But they came through that spell without serious threat to their goal and started to get forward again themselves.</p>
      <p>“Even in the second half, we had chances and situations,” said Clough. “Peterborough are a free-scoring team who are fourth in the League and we restricted them to next to nothing. I think they would probably have been content with a 0-0 but it’s probably why they are in the top six – and we are not – that they can win a game like that. We might not be in the bottom six – but it feels like it at the moment.”</p>
      <p>Clough said he was baffled about being booked and intended to ask the referee why after the game.</p>
      <p>The Brewers boss had been making his feelings known to the officials for much of the match – as had his counterpart in the opposing dugout, Darren Ferguson.</p>
      <p>“I’m frustrated with quite a few of the decisions,” said Clough. “It was baffling, some of the things we saw out there and I am looking forward to going in and having a quiet chat (with the referee).”</p>
      <p>What was the reason for his booking?</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what for. He just came over and said ‘unacceptable behaviour.’ I said ‘what’s that?’ and he ran off,” said Clough. “ I’ll be asking what for. I didn’t think you could give someone a yellow card without telling them why.</p>
      <p>“The Peterborough bench were getting unbelievably frustrated with what was going on as well. The only recourse we have is to give him bottom marks, which is what we think he deserves. What we want is the quality of the refereeing to match the quality of the teams.”</p>
      <p>Clough had been notably annoyed that the game was not stopped when Oliver Sarkic was down after getting a blow to the face.</p>
      <p>“The referee was about five yards away and we are told that, with a head injury, they are supposed to stop the game but he chose not to,” added Clough. He’s got a thick lip, the lad obviously caught him. He had to change his shirt, with the blood on it.”</p>
