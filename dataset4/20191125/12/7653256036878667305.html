      <p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/West-Bengal">West Bengal</a> Chief Minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Mamata-Banerjee">Mamata Banerjee</a> on Monday announced that all refugee colonies on central government and private lands up to 3 acres will be regularised.</p>
      <p>The displaced people will also be given land rights by the Trinamool Congress government, Banerjee said.</p>
      <p>Her statement came in the backdrop of the Centre's announcement that the National Register of Citizens (NRC) process would be carried out across the country.</p>
      <p>Alleging that the TMC is protecting illegal immigrants from Bangladesh as they are the party's votebank, senior BJP leaders have asserted that NRC would be implemented in the state.</p>
      <p>The state government had earlier regularized 94 refugee colonies which were on state government land, she said after a Cabinet meeting.</p>
      <p>"But there are several refugee colonies on the land owned by the central government and private parties. We have been saying this for a long time asking them to regularise these refugee colonies and provide them with land possession. However, they have sending eviction notices," Banerjee said.</p>
