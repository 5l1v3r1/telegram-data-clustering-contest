      <p>Toronto rap artist <b>Tory Lanez</b>‘s <i>Chixtape 5</i> did big numbers on SoundScan. The hip-hop crooner’s newest solo effort debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200.</p>
      <p>After 7 days of availability, the new studio project <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/tory-lanez-chixtape-5-number-2-debut-billboard-200">sold over 80,000 copies</a>.</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/tory-lanez">Tory Lanez</a>‘s <i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/tory-lanez-chixtape-5-album-stream">Chixtape 5</a></i> is opening this week at No. 2 on the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/billboard-200">Billboard 200</a>, garnering a total of 83,000 equivalent album units. Of that number, 9,000 account for album sales and 73,000 for streaming equivalent album units — equating to 94 million on-demand audio streams for the songs and officially making it the most-streamed album of the week. <i>Chixtape 5</i>‘s debut follows 2018’s <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2018/10/tory-lanez-love-me-now-album-stream"><i>Love Me Now?</i></a> at No. 4 and <i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2018/3/tory-lanez-memories-dont-die-album-stream">Memories Don’t Die</a></i> at No. 3, along with 2016’s <i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2016/8/tory-lanez-i-told-you-stream">I Told You</a></i> at No. 4. (HYPEBEAST)</blockquote>
      <p>Initial reports suggested Lanez’s latest solo effort <a href="https://www.sohh.com/tory-lanezs-chixtape-5-album-narrowly-misses-no-1-in-first-week-sales/">would miss out on the top spot</a> on Billboard with <b>Celine Dion</b>‘s <i>Courage</i> pushing out around 120,000 copies.</p>
      <blockquote>Also heading for a high debut on the next Billboard 200 is Tory Lanez’s new <i>Chixtape 5</i> album. Forecasters suggest it could possibly bow at No. 2 with around 90,000 equivalent album units earned. If it starts as expected, it would secure Lanez is fourth consecutive top 5-charting effort. (Billboard)</blockquote>
      <p>Some initial estimates had the project <a href="https://www.sohh.com/tory-lanezs-chixtape-5-album-narrowly-misses-no-1-in-first-week-sales/">selling at least 65,000 units</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>The album features artists like <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Lil-wayne">Lil Wayne</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Ashanti">Ashanti</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Ludacris">Ludacris</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Jagged-edge">Jagged Edge</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Mario">Mario</a>, and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Mya">Mýa</a>. Ashanti pulls double duty as the cover star, too. <i>Chixtape 5</i> is projected to move 65,000 – 75,000 equivalent album units in its first week, which would be the best sales week of his career if it holds up. (Genius)</blockquote>
      <p>In a recent interview, Lanez <a href="https://www.sohh.com/tory-lanezs-chixtape-5-album-narrowly-misses-no-1-in-first-week-sales/">admitted he put together</a> the album for the love of music and not financial gain.</p>
      <blockquote>“We actually didn’t do this from a monetary standpoint, we did this from a standpoint of like, I’m losing money doing the album but what is gonna come out of it? Of course it’s gonna be incredible. I feel like it’s damn near at a place where it’s gonna be critically acclaimed because no one ever did it before.” (Hot 97)</blockquote>
