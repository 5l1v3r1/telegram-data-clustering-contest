      <p>Social media users were left amused and bemused this past weekend after a thread on Twitter, claiming a cat was inhabiting the driver of a taxi in the inner city of Johannesburg, went viral.</p>
      <p>Following Twitter user @Thandoo_Zuma's tweet that she had witnessed the feline mystery while travelling from Bree Street in the inner city to Fourways, a number of commuters said they had been spooked about the man's apparent "meowing" while driving.</p>
      <p>It has even grabbed the attention of the City of Johannesburg.</p>

      <p>In the thread, @Thandoo_Zuma mentions that it was not her first time in the "cat" taxi, and that her friend had also experienced the same thing.</p>
      <p>Soon after the series of tweets, #Bree and #CatDriver started to trend, with some claiming they had also seen the "cat" while commuting in the taxi.</p>
      <p>Another user, @lerato_dude, said he was in the taxi when he asked a fellow commuter seated next to him whether what he was seeing was real. He was ignored.</p>
      <p>This led to some claiming that only a select few can see the image, while others, said the cat was probably a passenger.</p>

      <p>Of course, Tweeps were also naturally amused by the different theories being presented:</p>
