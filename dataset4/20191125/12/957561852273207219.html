      <p>I moved to the United States in August 2016 to attend graduate school where I would be trained to become a mental health clinician. It was an interesting era — at the peak of presidential election mayhem. I was a young immigrant student sandwiched between the anxieties of a Trump-Pence presidency and the romanticized hope of #ImWithHer.</p>
      <p>On my second day in the city, as I walked the streets of North Michigan Avenue, a woman screamed with brazen abandon: “Hey, go back to your country!” I walked away without saying anything. I had been trained well to handle these situations before I moved: Don’t make eye contact, don’t say anything, don’t get shot, don’t get deported. The American dream was too precious to lose. I’d learned that I was easily dispensable in the United States even before I left India. There are no lessons on resistance when the trade-off is conjoined to personal safety or losing everything you have worked for in less than five minutes.</p>
      <p>In November 2016, when Trump won, America felt scarier, like an impending doom. My roommate and I spent the entire day at home because that felt safer than the anxiety of being othered more rapidly outside. We looked different, we spoke differently, we had visas, and we were still in school. Trump had spent the entirety of the year talking about how he’d take America back from them. We were a part of “them.” Silencing became more rampant as the fear of being dispossessed kept us occupied. Anger was meant to be shared within four walls while despair and hopelessness became a unanimous chant of “Well, what can we even do?”</p>

      <p>I attended classes every day and worked part-time in an inner city school on the South Side of Chicago. I was applying for my clinical internship to qualify for state licensure and graduation. I had a lot to lose, but I also had a lot to offer. The spotlight remained on how America had done me a favor by “allowing” me to study and work. I was supposed to feel grateful, first; worthy, later. The powerlessness attached with immigration in the United States renders immigrant labor and sweat as worthless. The emphasis on what we cannot do is always stronger; and while we flood our minds with perpetual anxiety of being expelled from this country and the institutions it holds, we internalize defeat faster than any hope.</p>
      <p>Two years later, in July of 2018, I finished graduate school and got my first job. I was going to be a mental health clinician at a reputed human rights organization. It was a residential facility for undocumented immigrants. The minors would be detained by ICE at the border and they stayed at this facility until they could be reunited with their families or attain safe placements as their cases continued.</p>
      <blockquote>The powerlessness attached with immigration in the United States renders immigrant labor and sweat as worthless.</blockquote>
      <p>I worked in collaboration with the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the Office of Trafficking in Persons, and the Illinois Department of Child and Family Services, among many others within the state and federal government institutions. I watched the process of immigration closely. I provided mental health services to children who were separated from their parents, and I observed sudden changes in policies that would depopulate residential facilities to assist with decongesting ICE facilities at the border. I signed my name on reports, I completed assessments that would be documented on their files, and I worked with partner organizations that teamed with lawyers to help the participants gain benefits and pro bono services.</p>
      <p>Survivors of violence from all over the world narrated their stories of abuse, displayed their bruises for evidence, and repeated these accounts to multiple parties so that the U.S. government could view them as worthy of safety in this country. Young children travelled across the borders, by themselves, to be reunited with their parents who had been striving hard to have some respite from poverty. Young girls had been raped on their journeys, trafficked from their countries, and became pregnant without any syllabus on consent. They were all housed under the same roof, trying to cope with their traumas, live with their anxieties, and manage their depressive symptoms while doctoring their daily functioning to harbor some form of hope that they could sustain a life in the “land of the free.” We were their care providers, the intermediary between the U.S. government and an opportunity to build a life with the bare necessities that they had always dreamt of.</p>
      <p>One of the more important things that happened to me when I worked in this center was that I was constantly processing and politicizing my role in this setting. The intersections of my racial, ethnic, gender, sexual identities with my interactions with this population and with the U.S. government. Participants would often ask about my journey to the United States. With a developed awareness of the detailed accounts that constituted multiple obstacles and life threatening encounters on their journeys, I was mindful of the language I used to narrate mine. I educated them about the student visa, the rules and regulations for immigrants with documents, and the challenges for securing visa extension and work authorizations. It felt like a duty to be fulfilled.</p>
      <p>They looked at me and said, “Of course, they gave you a visa,” with verbal and nonverbal cues that highlighted the privilege that allowed me to get my passport stamped with a U.S. visa in 2016. I hailed from an upper middle class family, grew up in the financial capital of India with access to all the resources that would be instrumental in marketing me as a model immigrant during the process.</p>

      <p>I was aware of needing documentation for myself for sustenance in America. While the journey may have been easier than others, immigration anxiety becomes a familiar companion as soon as you cross the border. I remember attending immigration seminars during graduate school that were structured to educate international students about the do’s and don’ts of a model immigrant. We were told that even a speeding ticket or jaywalking could be harmful to our legal status in the United States. The emphasis remained on being alert of one’s actions, safeguarding the documentation, and being hyperaware of repercussions.</p>
      <p>Anxiety felt like a shadow that clouded rationality, in moments. In my first week in the United States, I received a crank call that said that I had attempted fraud, so immigration was coming to arrest me in a few minutes. Petrified, I started crying and informing them that I had only recently arrived to the United States and that I had not attempted any fraud. My roommate recognized that this was a prank call. Why would someone warn me about my arrest? I was shaking, I broke down. I spent hours on the web searching for stories of such prank calls to be sure that I didn’t have to surrender somewhere before getting deported.</p>
      <p>Before graduating in 2018, I knew that I had to start the job search way before my peers. The dreaded question in every job application was: “Do you need an H1B visa?” The H1B is the work visa that’s solely reliant on your company’s ability to sponsor you and advocate for why you are a valuable addition to the company and by default, the American economy. My authorization for work would not start until after July 2018; I started applying for work in April 2018. I applied to 235 jobs, gave three interviews, received two offers, and accepted one.</p>
      <p>I was cognizant of being enterprising for my visa documentation, so I started the discussion nine months in advance. The dreaded H1B visa would define the duration of my stay. I received a response that reassured me of how proactive the organization would be in the completion of this process. The bureaucracy, ignorance, and immense disregard that followed for the next nine months was indicative of the lack of initiative within organizations. The visa was held hostage over my head with demands for other paperwork that were organizational requirements and not immigration requirements, there was no organizational guidance on the complex nature of the process and utter disregard for the deadline at hand.</p>
      <blockquote>Many situations reveal a lack of advocacy or poor communication between agents who have the power to influence the documentation status of immigrant employees, outside of the U.S. government.</blockquote>
      <p>I was put in touch with a lawyer only three and a half weeks before my documentation was to expire. The inconsistencies in communication patterns continued. I’d responded to all the lawyer’s queries promptly only to receive radio silence for days. Two weeks before my legal status to work was to expire, the lawyer and organization scheduled a call. I spent the days leading up to this call with utter sleeplessness and a loss of appetite. I couldn’t focus, my mind calculated all the worst case scenarios — how would I pay my student loan? How would I find a sublease for this apartment in a few weeks? Will I successfully sell all this furniture? How many boxes do I need to pack? How much will it hurt to say goodbye to a city I have called home for three years?</p>
      <p>The lawyer discovered that the Trump administration had revoked the organization’s CAP Exempt status in the summer which meant that I no longer qualified for documentation in this year. There were no answers or alternatives. My time in the U.S. was over, my labor of nine months was rendered meaningless, and just like that, I had been uprooted from a place I had treated as my home. An ignorant attitude, an avoidable mishap, an inevitable deportation.</p>

      <p>Immigration mishaps are not uncommon in the United States. Unfortunately, we also internalize that we will always be easily dispensable. Many situations reveal a lack of advocacy or poor communication between agents who have the power to influence the documentation status of immigrant employees, outside of the U.S. government. Organizational negligence and insensitivity towards the treatment of immigrant employees are unspoken forms of abuse in the United States. I paid my taxes, I served this country’s government as a human rights worker, I was that immigrant with specialty services, and I was still not good enough. No one is.</p>
      <p>For a country where immigration is at the epicenter of numerous political issues with opinionated voices talking about how people need to enter the country the “right way,” there is minimal to no education on what the “right way” looks like, there is no dedication to the retention of employees who have committed their time and resources to the betterment of this country, and there is no awareness on the challenges that entail in the complex intricacies of the American immigration system. The commodification of workers is a ruthlessly normalized practice and so is the dehumanizing tendency of treating them as expendable goods. I gained immensely from my time in this country. But this country has gained immensely from me, too.</p>
      <p>I’d never visited the United States until I moved. My perception was informed by what I saw and what I was told. I believed that every nook had a high rise building competing with the Empire State building and every corner harbored respect and valued human contribution. Romantic as it sounds, America does an incredible job at marketing itself. It doesn’t mean that one is blind to the realities of systemic violence, but the bargaining is irresistable.</p>
      <p>It seduces you. It encourages you to believe that if you arrived at these borders, you will be embraced into safety, you will be of significance, you will be an equal. However, the reality is that you negotiate your levels of toleration, you assess how bigotry affects you, you exhaust yourself by always being on edge with immigration, and you question how much of it is actually worth it when you are constantly told that you owe this country everything.</p>
