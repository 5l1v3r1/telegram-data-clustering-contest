      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/ozzy-osbourne-solo-albums-ranked-from-worst-to-best">Ozzy Osbourne</a> took to the stage at the American Music Awards in Los Angeles last night to team up once again with Post Malone, Travis Scott and Andrew Watt.</p>
      <p>They played the track <i>Take What You Want</i> at The Forum, with Ozzy spending part of the explosive performance encouraging the crowd from the back of the stage.</p>
      <p>Ozzy’s appearance came just days after he joined Malone, Scott and California Breed guitarist Watt for the song in LA on the final night of Malone’s tour. </p>
      <p>It was Ozzy's first live performance after spending much of 2019 recuperating after being <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/ozzy-osbourne-hospitalised">hospitalised with pneumonia</a> and <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/sharon-osbourne-describes-extent-of-ozzys-injuries-after-recent-fall">injuring his back, neck and shoulders</a> in a nasty fall at home.</p>
