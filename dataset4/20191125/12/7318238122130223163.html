      <p>Uber has said it plans to launch an appeal after London's transport regulator stripped the ridesharing company of its operating license for a second time in just over two years.</p>
      <p>Transport for London (TfL) revoked the license on Monday after finding the app was not "fit and proper" and that a change in the system had endangered users' safety.</p>
      <p>According to TfL, the Uber app allows unauthorised drivers to use the accounts of other drivers to carry out trips by letting them upload their pictures to authorised driver accounts.</p>
      <p>This happened on at least 14,000 trips across the UK's capital, TfL said.</p>
      <p>"It is unacceptable that Uber has allowed passengers to get into minicabs with drivers who are potentially unlicensed and uninsured," TfL's director of licensing, regulation and charging, Helen Chapman, said.</p>
      <p>London's mayor <a href="https://twitter.com/SadiqKhan/status/1198908741548171264">Sadiq Khan</a> also welcomed the decision on Monday, stressing the safety of Londoners was his "paramount concern".</p>
      <p>He said: "I support the decision by TfL's licensing officials today in relation to Uber and completely understand why the decision was taken.</p>
      <p>"Keeping Londoners safe is my absolute number-one priority, and TfL have identified a pattern of failure by Uber that has directly put passengers' safety at risk."</p>
      <p>In response, Uber said it planned to appeal the decision and insisted it had taken steps to change its system and increase safety standards.</p>
      <p>"Over the last two months we have audited every driver in London," Uber said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"We have robust systems and checks in place to confirm the identity of drivers and will soon be introducing a new facial matching process, which we believe is a first in London taxi and private hire."</p>
