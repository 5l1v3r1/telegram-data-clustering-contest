Their work for our clients, support for each other, belief in the firm and our vision to be the law firm at the centre of New Zealand’s economic and commercial heartland and to be world class underpins everything this award stands for. Our growth and continued success are directly attributable to our people and culture.”</p>

This award belongs to every member of our team across all four of our offices.”</p>
      <p>Calder’s win as Managing Partner (Chief Executive) of the Year follows him taking out Chief Executive of the Year at last year’s Westpac Waikato Business Excellence Awards.</p>
