      <p>When <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/shawn-mendes/">Shawn Mendes</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/camila-cabello/">Camila Cabello</a> almost kissed at the end of their <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/american-music-awards/">American Music Awards</a> performance last night, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/billy-porter/">Billy Porter</a> couldn’t contain their excitement.</p>
      <p>And honestly, same.</p>
      <p>The loved up couple were singing their hit-duet Señorita and things were certainly heating up on stage.</p>
      <p>But at the end – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/22/shawn-mendes-camila-cabello-make-debut-couple-mtv-vmas-performance-10611143/">much like their VMA performance</a> a couple of months ago – they lean in and look like they’re about to kiss… then they don’t.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>It’s a real rollercoaster of emotions and it looked like we weren’t the only ones feeling it.</p>
      <p>Just as Shawn and Camila look like they’re about to lock lips, the camera cuts to Taylor, 29, and Billy, 50, who are in peak fangirl mode in the audience.</p>
      <p>Taylor held onto Billy’s shoulder in anticipation, as Billy raised his hand to his mouth in shock.</p>

      <p>The reaction from the unlikely duo caused a flurry of discussion on social media.</p>
      <p>One fan tweeted: ‘Can I just say Taylor Swift and Billy Porter watching the AMA performance of “Señorita” is meeeee’.</p>
      <p>While another tweeted: ‘I am loving Taylor Swift and Billy Porter’s reactions’.</p>
      <p>And another demanded: ‘I need gifs of Billy Porter and Taylor Swift’.</p>
      <p>Iconic.</p>
