      <p>A “resource vortex” is sucking investment away from the north west of Northern Ireland, Colum Eastwood said.</p>
      <p>The SDLP leader called for a policy of regional “economic fairness”.</p>
      <p>He urged politicians to engage in meaningful discussions to restore Stormont powersharing following the General Election to help free up decision making.</p>

      <p>He said: “Some have accused me of developing policies that would only suit my own city of Derry – which as a candidate in this election, I make no apologies for.</p>
      <p>“However, my belief in regional fairness is broader than one ambition and is rooted in providing opportunity for people across this island.</p>
      <p>“We cannot afford to sustain a model which creates a resource vortex in Belfast, drawing in and trapping investment and talent to the detriment of all other communities.</p>
      <p>“Opportunity does not begin and end on this island’s eastern corridor.”</p>
      <p>He said the dangers of focusing investment in small geographic areas were clear from the rent crisis in Dublin where young workers and students were suffering most.</p>
      <p>He added: “Instead of fuelling this model, we should be seeking to create sectoral geographic counterpoints to balance the system.</p>
      <p>“The SDLP will pursue a policy of regional economic fairness because it is right politically and because it is smart economically.”</p>
