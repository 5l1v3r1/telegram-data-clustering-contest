      <p>Gas prices are on the rise in the Central Okanagan – but not in the north and south parts of the valley.</p>
      <p>Several stations in Kelowna and West Kelowna this morning hiked their price for unleaded gasoline from 117.9 cents per litre to 131.9, which represents a whopping 14-cent hike.</p>
      <p>However, gasbuddy.com indicates most Kelowna stations were still at 117.9 around the noon hour.</p>
      <p>The cheapest gas in the Okanagan can still be found in Lake Country, where most stations were selling for 116.9.</p>
      <p>Vernon was still holding steady at 122.9 as well.</p>
      <p>Penticton prices are still on the lower end of the scale as well, checking in between 119.9 and 121.9 cents per litre.</p>
