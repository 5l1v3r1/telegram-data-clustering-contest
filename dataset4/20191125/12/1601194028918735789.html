      <p>BCCI President and former Indian skipper <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/sourav-ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a> applauded <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/india-vs-bangladesh">India's first-ever pink ball Test</a> while speaking with IANS in an interview. India won the encounter against Bangladesh by an innings and 46 runs in front of a packed stadium of more than 50,000 fans in Kolkata.</p>
      <p>Ganguly expressed joy at the atmosphere during the final session on the second day of the historic pink-ball Test. The 47-year-old revealed that the match took him to the nostalgic memories of the 2001 Test between India and Australia.</p>
      <blockquote>Just take a look around (fans with their camera lights on to click pictures). Do you see this? Have you seen this in Test cricket? When was the last time you had a capacity crowd watching a Test match? Feels like it is a World Cup final.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Oh! It is an absolutely amazing feeling. Feels great. Look for yourself. It brings back memories of the 2001 Test match if you ask me. This is what Test cricket should be, packed stadiums.</blockquote>
      <p>After realizing that former Indian player Rahul Dravid would have loved to play the day/night Test match, Ganguly revealed his happiness and answered if he would have felt the same.</p>
      <blockquote>It is very kind of him (Rahul Dravid). Feels very good when your teammates compliment you. Coming from him, it is special. I am very happy. Yes, it is a very satisfying feeling.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>You cannot say that as we have all had our time. When we were playing, the T20 had just come in and look at how it has spread and now this. So you cannot think that way.</blockquote>

      <p>When quizzed if India could play more day/night Test matches ahead, Ganguly quoted that he would work it out with BCCI and plan them soon.</p>
      <blockquote>Too early to talk of the future. We will all sit down and discuss the way ahead after this one. But just imagine the frenzy if you have teams like England, South Africa and Australia playing pink ball Tests against India. Think what the crowd will get to witness.</blockquote>
      <p>India cruised comfortably in a one-sided encounter where skipper <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/virat-kohli">Virat Kohli</a> became the first Indian to score a century in a pink-ball Test. Ganguly praised Kohli for his consistency in batting and also complimented India's bowling department ahead of the New Zealand tour in January.</p>
      <blockquote>Oh he (Virat Kohli) is just brilliant. What a knock. I have played alongside some of the best and he definitely belongs in that category. Just a pleasure to watch the consistency with which he scores runs. He is a run-machine.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>I will not compare this bowling attack with the ones in the past, but this is a very good attack. New Zealand are a good team. At home, in their own conditions, it will be challenging but I am hopeful Virat and the boys will do well there as well.</blockquote>
