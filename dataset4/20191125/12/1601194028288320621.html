      <p>One of the most interesting aspects of today's WWE is how quickly the fortunes of a performer can change. While there have been numerous instances of a superstar falling from grace in a dime, there have also been moments where a superstar has been able to endear himself to the fans in no time.</p>
      <p>Ever since moving to the USA Network in late September, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">NXT</a> has been one of the best weekly wrestling shows. Despite the initial scaremongering and skepticism the Black and Gold Brand has stayed true to its roots. NXT's weekly TV show has allowed a plethora of superstars to make a name for themselves in front of a nationwide audience.</p>
      <p>The addition of NXT to Survivor Series has been a boon for the brand and its Superstars. NXT Superstars being featured regularly on RAW and SmackDown has helped the brand get more exposure. The Superstars have gotten the opportunity to showcase their skills in front of a wider audience, and during the build-up to Survivor Series, a number of superstars were part of the so-called developmental brand's invasion of RAW and SmackDown. But, there have been a select few who have stood out from the rest of the pack. Here are three NXT Superstars who have risen to the occasion over the few weeks:</p>
      <h4>#3 Keith Lee</h4>

      <p>Touted as a blue-chip prospect for the company, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/keith-lee">Keith Lee's</a> career in WWE has been a story of two halves. The initial part of Lee's run in NXT saw him rack up a couple of impressive victories on NXT TV but sadly the Texas-native wasn't able to reach the heights one had hoped for when he first signed with the company in 2017. Following an undisclosed injury in March, Lee had to step away from the squared circle for a few months.</p>
      <p>The former PWG stand-out was quite the rage on the independent circuit before arriving in WWE. Lee was renowned for pulling off moves which men of his size aren't capable of. But, for a while, it seemed like the Limitless One will become just a footnote in the already stacked NXT roster.</p>
      <p>But, this is where things took a turn for the good for the Texas native. Following NXT's move to the USA Network, Lee feuded with Dominick Dijakovic and the duo had a series of matches that not only mesmerized the Full Sail faithful but also became a hot topic of discussion in the wrestling world. The duo's athletic ability and their panache to pull off intricate acrobatic moves were able to capture the imagination of wrestling fans all across the globe.</p>
      <p>Lee was an integral part of NXT'S invasion of Raw and SmackDown over the past few weeks. As part of Team Ciampa, Lee was victorious in his debut Takeover appearance at NXT Takeover: Wargames on Saturday. But, what truly marked the arrival of Lee as a potential future megastar was his performance in the Traditional 5-on-5-on-5 Men's Elimination Match at Survivor Series last night.</p>
      <p>Not only was the Limitless One the last survivor for Team NXT, he more than held his own against two of the best that the company has to offer in <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/roman-reigns">Roman Reigns</a> and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/seth-rollins">Seth Rollins</a>. Lee was able to score a major upset as he pinned Rollins before finally falling to a spear from Reigns. Lee had a star-making performance in the match and we can't wait to see what the future holds for him.</p>
