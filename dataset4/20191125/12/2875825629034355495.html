      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:43:39+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:43</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Mikel Arteta is reportedly ready to hold talks with Arsenal about replacing Unai Emery as boss.</p>
      <p>Emery beat Arteta to the top job in north London in 2018 after legendary Gunners boss Arsene Wenger stepped down following his 22-year reign at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal.</a></p>
      <p>Arteta, who represented Arsenal as a player from 2011 to 2016, retained his job as Pep Guardiola's assistant manager at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City,</a> helping the team win a second Premier League title in as many seasons last campaign.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> are struggling under Emery this season and have failed to win in their past six fixtures.</p>
      <p>Pressure is growing on the Spaniard amid claims the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-stars-lost-faith-unai-20954696">Arsenal squad are losing faith in Emery's ability</a> to turn their season around.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/sport/arsenal-set-sights-on-mikel-arteta-with-unai-emery-on-brink-cgc60vgsj?wgu=270525_54264_15746856198026_31ba8c7e4c&amp;wgexpiry=1582461619&amp;utm_source=planit&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=22278">The Times,</a> Arteta is keen to talk to the Arsenal board about possibly replacing his compatriot at the helm at Arsenal.</p>
      <p>The report adds that Gunners chiefs are also interested in speaking to Massimiliano Allegri, who has been out of work since stepping down at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus.</a></p>
      <p>Allegri, like Arteta, was interviewed for the Arsenal job last year but wanted to go on a sabbatical following his long stint managing in Italy.</p>

      <p>Arsenal dropped two points against Sheffield United last time out, with Alexandre Lacazette rescuing the Gunners with the final kick of the match.</p>
      <p>Emery said after the game: "The club are supporting me every day and also I have a responsibility.</p>
      <p>"I know I can do better, I can take more performances with the players and I'm going to try to do that. Now my job is to analyse, to try to move on with confidence with the players.</p>

      <p>"It's difficult but we need to move on in the next days. After analysing that match we are going to play at home again on Thursday, prepare as well as possible.</p>
      <p>"We know, and I know, that we need to connect with our supporters."</p>
