      <p>Quebec is bringing in a new measure for impaired drivers that will require repeat offenders to pass a breathalyzer every time they drive, in what one expert describes as among the toughest policies in the country.</p>
      <p>Beginning Nov. 25, people found guilty of a second offence will only ever be allowed to drive vehicles equipped with an alcohol ignition interlock device, which prevents the car from starting until the driver has blown into a mouthpiece that measures blood-alcohol concentration.</p>
      <p>That's in addition to existing penalties, which include licence suspension, vehicle seizure and criminal sanctions.</p>
      <p>The CEO of Mothers Against Drunk Driving Canada expressed support for the rule, which he described as "by far the most progressive in North America and globally" when it comes to interlock devices and repeat offenders.</p>
      <p>But Andrew Murie said the province will need to work hard to ensure it's enforced, since many habitual offenders will look for ways to skirt the rules.</p>
      <p>"The tougher the penalties become, (the more) they will find and try to find ways around complying with that legislation," Murie said Monday in a phone interview.</p>
      <p>Hubert Sacy, the director of the Quebec-based alcohol awareness group Educ'alcool, says studies have shown interlock devices are the best way to deal with repeat offenders because they protect both the driver and society at large by taking away the possibility of drinking and driving at a time when a person's judgment is impaired.</p>
      <p>However, he believes the cost to install and maintain the devices can be a problem, since many repeat offenders who struggle with alcohol are low-income.</p>
      <p>"One thousand, $1,200, $1,500 per year is a lot of money when you are of limited means," says Sacy, whose group is lobbying the provincial government to help bring down the costs.</p>
      <p>Murie, on the other hand, doesn't see cost as a problem. He points out that the cost of an interlock device is just a few dollars a day â€” less than the price of one drink.</p>
      <p>"What happens is, for them to comply with the legislation and be able to operate their vehicle, they need to drink a lot less," he said.</p>
