      <h1>Burton curry house hopes regulars will return after fixing hygiene problems</h1>
      <h2>'We wanted a clean slate', bosses have said</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:05:57+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:05</time> by <a rel="author">Rhea Turner</a></address>
      <p>A well-known Burton curry house that went downhill after a damning hygiene inspection has turned its fortunes around.</p>
      <p>Manzil hit the headlines for the wrong reasons in March when inspectors found a risk of "cross-contamination" in its kitchen and gave it a one-star hygiene rating.</p>
      <p>Since then new director Abdul Muhit has taken the reins - and a recent re-inspection has seen the Guild Street restaurant given five stars.</p>
      <p>Mr Muhit, 26, said the business suffered as a result of the previous inspection, which also raised issues <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/burton-mum-looks-amazing-after-3558939">including food left uncovered and bare </a>chipboard exposed on shelves.</p>
      <p>But after closing for a major refurbishment, it reopened as Manzil Gold on July 22 and has made major improvements.</p>
      <p>Mr Muhit, who took over on July 8, said: "We have been working really hard to show customers what we have to offer but a lot of people have been waiting for our re-inspection.</p>
      <p>"They are happy with the food and the service but they were not happy with the hygiene rating.</p>
      <p>"The restaurant has always had a really good reputation but that rating tainted it and we were really suffering as a result. We wanted a clean slate."</p>
      <p>Mr Muhit believes the new hygiene rating will see more customers coming through the door.</p>
      <p>He said: "The business went downhill after that report was published and they couldn’t recover. They couldn’t survive and run it after that.</p>
      <p>"I think the previous regulars felt let down and I think they will be coming back through the doors now.</p>

      <p>"We feel like we have waited so long for this. I'm really happy that the inspection went well and we finally have our five stars which we deserve.</p>
      <p>"I hope now people will see we have worked hard to turn it back around and they will <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink/duke-york-launches-amazing-new-3557754">start coming back to see what we have to offer."</a></p>
      <p>Inspectors who visited Manzil Gold on November 18 found only one issue that needed rectifying within a month.</p>
      <p>The report read: "There were some gaps/holes noted in the dry goods store rooms and a hole was also noted in the bar area next to the wash hand basin."</p>
