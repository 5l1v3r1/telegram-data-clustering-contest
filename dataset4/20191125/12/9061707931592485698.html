      <p>Police officers burst three tyres of an uninsured car as it drove through a South Derbyshire village.</p>
      <p>The driver of a Citroen without insurance failed to stop for Derbyshire Police officers as it travelled along <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/overseal">the A444 near Overseal</a> .</p>
      <p>According to a tweet from Derbyshire Roads Policing Unit's dedicated Twitter page, three cars were sat further along the road and "stung" the vehicle, deflating three tyres.</p>
      <p>The vehicle was then boxed in by officers and the four occupants were detained.</p>
      <p>The tweet reads: "<a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/traffic-and-travel">A444 near Overseal</a>. Citroen with no insurance fails to stop for one of us.</p>
      <p>"Driver didn't expect a gaggle of three more roads policing unit cars further down the road.</p>
