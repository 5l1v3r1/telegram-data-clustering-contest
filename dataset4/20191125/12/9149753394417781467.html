      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:30:11+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/pc-gamer/" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a></address>
      <p>Looking for a cheap RAM deal for your gaming PC? Right now on Newegg you can get 16GB (2x8GB) of DDR4 CORSAIR Vengeance RGB Pro RAM <a href="https://www.newegg.com/corsair-16gb-288-pin-ddr4-sdram/p/N82E16820236426">for $70</a>â€”the lowest price it's been for months. If you pick this up you're essentially saving $20 on the average price for 2019, which is a decent wedge. This RAM features stylish RGB lighting, high bandwidth, and tight response times, making it ideal for any gaming rig you want to run fast <i>and</i> look cool. Well, if RGB is your thing.</p>
      <p>Or how about this deal on 16GB (2x8GB) of CORSAIR Vengeance LPX RAM? This RAM has been designed with overclocking in mind, featuring a robust aluminium heat spreader. This gives you overclocking headroom if you're looking to push things a little further in your PC, and it's a cheap way to extend the life of other components in your rig. And as with all Corsair RAM, you get a limited lifetime warranty, which is a neat extra.</p>
      <p>Looking at our <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-ddr4-ram/">best RAM for gaming</a> guide, both of these memory options compare well. So if you need some new RAM to slot into your PC, or you're building a new rig altogether, these deals are worth chasing down.</p>
