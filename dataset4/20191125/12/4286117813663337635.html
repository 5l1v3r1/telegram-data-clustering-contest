      <p>A bill to restrict who gets security from the elite Special Protection Group was introduced in the Lok Sabha Monday amid ruckus and sloganeering by opposition by Congress leaders. Minister of State for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy introduced the bill amid din in the house. The bill intends to make amendments to the Special Protection Group Act, 1988.</p>
      <p>The amendments will make two key changes: SPG will provide security only to Prime Minister of the day and immediate family members residing with him or her. The other key change is that former Prime Ministers will be guarded by SPG commandos only for a period of 5 years after demitting office.</p>
      <p>Immediate family members of former PMs will get SPG security as well as long as they are residing with the former PM at the allotted residence. The family will lose the security once the former PM loses it as well. This technically means if an ex-PM dies, his immediate family members would not be entitled to SPG cover.</p>
      <p>The SPG Act amendment bill comes days after the <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/no-spg-cover-for-gandhi-family-crpf-to-take-over-security-1617067-2019-11-08">Centre removed SPG cover for the Gandhi family</a>. Sonia Gandhi, son Rahul and daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were up until now being protected by the SPG. Earlier, <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/manmohan-singh-security-cover-degraded-from-by-mha-1591573-2019-08-26">SPG cover was also removed for former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</a>.</p>
      <p>Since then, Manmohan Singh as well as the Gandhi are being protected under the "Z plus" security cover of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/spg-controversy-security-nadda-bjp-congress-1620854-2019-11-20">move to revoke SPG cover</a> has been widely criticised with Congress leaders calling the move vindictive. Sources in the government had hit out at the Gandhi family citing occasions where they dispensed SPG at will, not abiding by the rules mandated for security cover.</p>
      <p>The Special Protection Group is an elite agency that is charged with the proximate security of the Prime Minister of India. The SPG was set up in 1985 after then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was killed by her own bodyguards in 1984.</p>
