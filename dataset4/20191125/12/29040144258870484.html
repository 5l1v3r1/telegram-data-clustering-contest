      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Huawei's new MatePad Pro is its first Android tablet with a hole-punch display.</li>
        <li>Powered by HiSilicon's latest flagship Kirin 990 processor, the MatePad Pro is Huawei's answer to the likes of the iPad Pro and Samsung Galaxy Tab S6.</li>
        <li>The tablet comes with a 10.8-inch AMOLED display, 13MP rear camera, and quad speakers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Huawei today took the wraps off (via <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_announces_the_matepad_pro_the_first_tablet_with_a_punchhole_display-news-40246.php"><i>GSMArena</i></a>) its latest flagship Android tablet, the MatePad Pro. As its name clearly suggests, the MatePad Pro is an <a href="https://www.imore.com/best-black-friday-ipad-deals">iPad Pro</a> challenger, featuring a strikingly similar design and flagship-grade internals.</p>
      <p>The tablet has a 10.8-inch AMOLED display panel with 2560 x 1600 resolution and a hole-punch cutout. Under the hood is a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/kirin-990-5g-huawei-unveils-mate-30-series-processor">Kirin 990</a> chipset, coupled with up to 8GB RAM and 256GB storage. You get a single 13MP camera on the back, while the hole-punch cutout on the front houses an 8MP camera for video calls.</p>

      <p>The tablet also has four speakers and a 7,250mAh battery with support for 40W fast charging, 15W wireless charging, as well as 7.5W reverse wireless charging. It supports an M-Pen stylus and a keyboard case too, although both accessories will be sold separately. Unsurprisingly, Huawei's new Android tablet ships with its EMUI 10 custom skin on top but lacks Google apps and services.</p>
      <p>The Huawei MatePad Pro is now available for pre-order in China for a starting price of 3,299 yuan ($470) for the base variant with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage. Huawei has priced the top-end 8GB + 256GB LTE variant of the tablet at 4,499 yuan ($640). The tablet is slated to go on sale in Huawei's home country from December 12. While there is no word on global availability yet, Huawei has confirmed that a 5G version of the tablet will arrive sometime in the first quarter of 2020.</p>
