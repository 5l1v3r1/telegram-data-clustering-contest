      <h1>Thrillseekers encouraged to head to Loch Ken in 2020 for Autumn of Endurance</h1>
      <h2>Events will be held in the area every weekend in September and October as part of Scotland’s Year of Coasts and Waters 2020</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:45:41+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author">Stuart Gillespie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/stuart-gillespie/</a></address>
      <p>People looking to push themselves to the limit are being encouraged to head to Loch Ken next year.</p>
      <p>The popular waterway at the heart of the Stewartry will play host to the Autumn of Endurance, offering everything from triathlons to cycling via paddle boarding.</p>
      <p>It is one of 30 events across the country recently added to the programme for Scotland’s Year of Coasts and Waters 2020.</p>
      <p>The festival is part of Loch Ken Alive and project officer Barney Fryer said: “What we are trying to do is establishing that at the end of the season, Loch Ken is where you come for outdoor wild events that are getting more popular all the time.</p>
      <p>“The Autumn of Endurance means that every weekend from the beginning of September to the middle of October there will be an event.</p>
      <p>“There will be the Beltie Triathlon, there is wild swimming at Galloway Activity Centre, we’ll have a cycling festival in Castle Douglas and there will be paddle boarding and dragon boat racing.</p>
      <p>“Barwhillanty Estate will be hosting End Game which is a quirky take on modern pentathlon. Instead of horse riding there could be kayaking, instead of shooting there could be archery. It’s multidisciplinary and all being held at the estate.”</p>

      <p>Loch Ken Alive is funded by the Galloway Glens Landscape Partnership and aims to boost the profile of the loch, encouraging locals and visitors to make more use of it.</p>
      <p>Barney, who took up his post last month, said: “Through Loch Ken Alive, we want to tell people all about the wonderful natural and cultural heritage of the area. We want to showcase all the activities you can do on the loch, as well as the beautiful views you can only see from the water. We want to see thriving businesses around the loch, creating employment opportunities so that people won’t have to leave the area to find work.</p>
      <p>“I’m really keen to hear the views of everyone who lives, works or plays around Loch Ken. We can’t build the Loch Ken plan without the voices of the Loch Ken people.”</p>

      <p>The Year of Coasts and Waters is the latest of the Scottish Government’s themed years.</p>
      <p>Culture and tourism minister, Fiona Hyslop, said: “We have an exciting year ahead celebrating Scotland’s wonderfully diverse coasts, canals, rivers and lochs. The Year of Coasts and Waters 2020 events programme is full of tours and exhibitions, great events, cultural performances, community activities and festivals, supported by over £770,000 of Scottish Government funding.”</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dumfries-galloway">The VisitScotland chief executive Malcolm Roughead added: “These celebrations will help to showcase the year and country across the globe.”</a>
