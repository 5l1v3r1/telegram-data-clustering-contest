      <h1>Kirkland Lake Gold to acquire Detour Gold in stock deal worth $4.9B</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:41:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:41</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Healing, The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>Shares in Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd. closed down 17 per cent or $10.94 at $52.38 on Monday after it announced an acquisition deal that it said valued smaller Canadian rival Detour Gold Corp. at $4.9 billion.</p>
      <p>In contrast, Detour shares closed 1.8 per cent higher at $22.61 after jumping by almost 10 per cent just after the Toronto Stock Exchange opened on Monday.</p>
      <p>Kirkland Lake said its purchase of Detour Gold, which owns the Detour Lake open pit gold mine in northeastern Ontario, would add a key component to its portfolio anchored by two gold mines, the Macassa mine in northern Ontario and Fosterville mine in Australia.</p>
      <p>"The addition of Detour Lake provides an opportunity to add a third cornerstone asset that is located in our backyard in northern Ontario," said Kirkland Lake CEO Tony Makuch.</p>
      <p>"Detour Lake will provide the pro forma company with a 20-plus year mine life which provides unparalleled optionality and excellent growth potential for the benefit of all shareholders."</p>
      <p>Under the agreement, Detour Gold shareholders will receive 0.4343 of a Kirkland Lake share for each Detour Gold share they hold.</p>
      <p>The exchange ratio implies a value of $27.50 per Detour Gold share -- or a total of $4.9 billion -- based on the closing price of Kirkland Lake shares on Friday. That's a 24 per cent premium to Detour Gold's closing price that day.</p>
      <p>At Monday's closing price, however, the deal values Detour at $4.03 billion.</p>
      <p>The deal to buy Detour Lake, when added to the company's plan to restart Kirkland Lake's Cosmo mine in Australia, dilutes the significance of Kirkland Lake's "extremely high-grade" Fosterville mine in Australia, said analyst Mike Parkin of National Bank in a report.</p>
      <p>He warned that could lead to its premium valuation falling more in line with the average of other well-regarded miners.</p>
      <p>The acquisition will add an asset with potential for growth above its current production of about 600,000 ounces per year, gives the company combined net cash of US$630 million and grows mineral reserves by 15.41 million ounces and reserve life by eight years, said Kirkland Lake</p>
      <p>It said it expects to realize cost saving synergies of US$75 million to $100 million per year.</p>
      <p>Kirkland Lake produced 723,701 ounces of gold in 2018 and has set a goal for 950,000 to one million ounces this year.</p>
      <p>The deal requires approval by a two-thirds majority vote by Detour Gold shareholders and a majority vote by Kirkland Lake Gold shareholders, in addition to regulatory and court approvals.</p>
      <p>If completed, existing Kirkland Lake shareholders will own about 73 per cent of the combined company, while Detour Gold shareholders will hold about 27 per cent.</p>
