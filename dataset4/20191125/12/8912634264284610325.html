      <p>DOHA: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Qatar Monday on his first official trip to an Arab country since Ankara's forces intervened in northeast Syria last month against Kurdish fighters.<br/>Erdogan will attend the fifth meeting of the Qatar-Turkey Higher Strategic Committee at the invitation of Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, the Qatar News Agency reported.<br/>The two countries are expected to sign a number of deals during Erdogan's third visit to Qatar since a regional boycott began in June 2017, which led to rising Turkish influence in Doha.<br/>Erdogan is also expected to visit a Turkish military base where around 5,000 troops are stationed amid reports that Qatar intends to buy 100 Turkish tanks.<br/>Doha declared its support for Ankara after it launched an offensive on Oct.Â 9 against a Syrian Kurdish militia, but Arab countries have condemned Turkey's "aggression".<br/>Qatar and Turkey have similar policies over Islamist groups, primarily the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>
