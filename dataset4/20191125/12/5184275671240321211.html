      <p>Time and again we have seen actresses getting trolled for gaining weight. The newest target of the trollers is television star Mahhi Vij. The actress just gave birth to a little angle and gained weight in the process. The netizens targeted her for the same but Mahhi had a befitting reply for all of them.</p>
      <p>Recently Mahhi posted a picture with Salman Khan, hubby Jay Bhanushali, and actor Paras Tyagi and Umar Riaz when she appeared on Bigg Boss’ Weekend Ka Vaar. She wore a green long dress and looked every inch of beautiful in it. This let to the troller taking a dig at her weight. One of the netizens wrote, “Sharam Kar Moti.” and made fun of her appearance. But Mahhi wasn’t ready to keep quiet about it.</p>

      <p>She took to Instagram and posted a few stories bashing the person who was body-shaming her. She posted a screenshot of the message he sent her and wrote, “Was your mother thin after delivering you like idiot.”</p>
      <p>The actress did not stop at that. She further added a few stories where she wrote, “Gaali bhi dete hai aur follow bhi karte hai (They use abusive language but follow you too). Fake accounts with no followers.” Well, that was quite a befitting answer.</p>
