      <p>For a while there it looked like <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/twenty-one-pilots/">twenty one pilots</a> might be taking it easy on the gig front in 2020, but the Ohio superstars – Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun – have just announced their biggest-ever date in Ireland next year.</p>
      <p>The pair will be hitting Summer In The City at the RDS Arena on June 25 alongside blackbear and <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/nothing-but-thieves/">Nothing But Thieves</a>, following sold-out Irish dates at the 3Arena Dublin and SSE Arena Belfast earlier in the year on their incredible Bandito Tour.</p>
      <p>Not only is it super-exciting to have the band crossing over the pond again so soon after their extensive UK and European touring in 2019, but it looks as though another very special appearance could be on the cards: are twenty one pilots going to play Glastonbury 2020?</p>
      <p>While the full Glasto line-up is yet to be announced, its special 50th anniversary event will be headlined by The Beatles icon Sir Paul McCartney, with Diana Ross also confirmed on the bill. And with the festival kicking off the same time Tyler and Josh are near the area, does this mean they’ll find themselves somewhere on the line-up, too? Let’s hope so…</p>
      <p>In the meantime, tickets to see twenty one pilots in Dublin go on sale this Friday at 9am via the <a href="https://shops.ticketmasterpartners.com/kerrang/">Kerrang! Ticket Store</a>.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere next year, the duo are also <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/twenty-one-pilots-to-play-european-festival-with-billie-eilish-taylor-swift-and-more/">headlining Spain’s Mad Cool</a> festival alongside Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift. Huge.</p>
      <p>The band are obviously seasoned festival headliners by now, having having taken on the UK’s own <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/reading-leeds-2019/">Reading &amp; Leeds</a> back in August. When Kerrang! asked Tyler ahead of the show what fans could expect from their debut headline slot, he enthused: “It’s tough to get everything in our live show to translate over into a festival set, but there’s something special about festivals, and something special about being outside, too.</p>
      <p>“There’s definitely an air of unpredictability, and you don’t really know exactly what to expect. You’d be a fool to assume that everybody is there to watch you – or even know who you are. So there’s a bit of a competitive edge to it, because there’s so many awesome bands on the bill, and so being motivated to rise above that giant pool of talent, and to make your mark, is something that we’re really excited to step up to that challenge.”</p>
