      <p><b>NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - </b>The man who is accused of wearing a diaper and posing as his fictitious disabled brother in order to trick hired caretakers into changing him for sexual gratification has changed his plea.</p>
      <p>He pleaded guilty to human trafficking and drug charges, but after he found out he could face jail time he reversed his plea.</p>
      <p>Rutledge Deas pleaded guilty in Orleans Parish Criminal Court on Monday (Nov. 25) to four counts of human trafficking, one count of possession of methamphetamine and one count of possessing drug paraphernalia.</p>
      <p>However, Judge Arthur Hunter threw out the paperwork after Deas’ decision to change his plea.</p>
      <p>Deas, 29, was arrested on Nov. 14 by state police.</p>
      <p>According to police, Deas utilized social media advertisements to obtain home health care for his mentally and physically handicapped 18-year-old brother named “Cory.”</p>
      <p>Police say that upon arranging for a home health care provider, Deas would then pose as “Cory” while allowing the care provider to change his adult diaper and obtain sexual arousal under the false pretenses of being handicapped.</p>
      <p>Deas was booked into the Orleans Parish Jail on 10 counts each of sexual battery and human trafficking and one count of possession of a schedule II controlled dangerous substance.</p>
      <p>Two of his victims made impact statements. Deas began crying in court as one of the victims spoke.</p>
