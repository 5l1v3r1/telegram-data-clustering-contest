      <p>After toying with lackluster miniature versions of its Genesis console, Sega finally hit its stride with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/12/sega-genesis-mini-review/">Genesis Mini</a>. The HDMI-equipped emulation device faithfully recreates the 16-bit experience without the laggy or choppy performance of previous efforts, making it a worthy competitor to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/27/snes-classic-edition-review/">Nintendo's SNES Classic</a>. The tiny console is currently on sale for $50 -- $30 off its usual price, making it an even more alluring purchase as a holiday gift.</p>
      <p>The Genesis Mini was produced by Sega's longtime partner M2, which specializes in painstakingly detailed emulation. And it's not just the software that's impressive; the console itself is a faithful, though miniaturized, recreation of the Model 1 Genesis, complete with a non-functioning volume slider and cartridge slot dust flap. This puts the Genesis Mini in stark contrast to Sega's previous efforts at a throwback units which were poorly constructed.</p>
      <p>While not every game featured on the Genesis Mini is a hit, there are plenty of games to sink your teeth into. Classics like <i><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-12-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-tries-again-with-a-new-trailer.html">Sonic</a> the Hedgehog 2</i> and <i>Gunstar Heroes</i> will transport you back to the early '90s, while rarities like <i>Contra Hard Corps</i> and <i>Monster World IV</i> could be new experiences even for gamers well-versed in the 16-bit library.</p>
      <p>You can grab the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PFT19MG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2019hybrid-20&amp;language=en_US">Sega Genesis Mini for $50 at Amazon</a>, as well as other electronics retailers. If have a decent collection of cartridges, you may want to consider the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/27/analogue-mega-sg-review/">Analogue Mega SG</a>, a full-sized Genesis clone which uses hardware emulation via FPGA to create a native HD experience.</p>
