      <h1>Massachusetts Legislators’ Rush to Judgment on Vaping Will Cause More Harm</h1>
      <h2>Massachusetts has a lesson for us.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:18:27+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:18</time> by <a rel="author">Jeffrey A. Singer</a></address>
      <p>Reacting to a media-fueled panic surrounding teen vaping, Massachusetts legislators this week <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/11/21/state-lawmakers-pass-nation-toughest-restrictions-sale-flavored-tobacco-and-vaping-products/EvvQMGT0naFzhPLiihnsvM/story.html?s_campaign=breakingnews:newsletter">banned</a> the sale of all flavored e-cigarettes, including menthol, and levied a 75 percent excise tax on vaping products. This was portrayed as “a forceful response to an epidemic in which one out of every five Massachusetts high-schoolers use e-cigarettes.” In reality, it is an impulsive act that ignores the evidence and endangers public health.</p>
      <p>Teen vaping rates should not be viewed in a vacuum. According to the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/trump-administration-combating-epidemic-youth-e-cigarette-use-plan-clear-market-unauthorized-non">National Youth Tobacco Survey</a> teen tobacco smoking is at an <a href="https://reason.com/2019/09/12/the-ban-on-flavored-e-cigarettes-may-lead-to-more-smoking-by-teenagers-as-well-as-adults/">all-time low</a>. Professor Michael Siegel of Boston University School of Public Health reports a strong <a href="https://tobaccoanalysis.blogspot.com/2019/09/e-cigarettes-are-gateway-to-smoking-so.html">negative correlation</a> between teen vaping and teen tobacco smoking. In other words, e-cigarettes are probably behind the drop in teen tobacco smoking.</p>
      <p>Numerous <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2737916">scientific</a> studies show that vaping is a very effective way to help tobacco smokers quit smoking. And while vaping might not be completely harmless, tobacco smoking is a proven killer. According to Public Health England e-cigarettes are “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/28/vaping-is-95-safer-than-smoking-claims-public-health-england">95 percent less harmful</a>” than tobacco cigarettes. And research finds e-cigarettes are “<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/news/heart-and-lungs/e-cigs-twice-effective-nicotine-patches-gum-or-sprays-quitting/">twice as effective</a>” as nicotine patches or gum in helping smokers quit.</p>
      <p>There were an estimated <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ecigs-us-adults/almost-one-in-20-u-s-adults-now-use-e-cigarettes-idUSKCN1LC2DN">11 million vapers</a> in the U.S. in 2018, and as of late November there have been an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/health/vaping-illness-tracker.html">estimated</a> 2,172 cases of vaping-related illnesses with 44 deaths reported. For <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/index.htm">perspective</a>, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states 16 million Americans live with tobacco smoking-related illness and 480,000 die annually.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, vaping-related lung injuries <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/public-global-health/465716-experts-say-vaping-illnesses-dont-extend-outside-us">have not been reported outside of the U.S</a>. This raises the question of whether the outbreak might be an unintended consequence of public policy.</p>
      <p>Germane to that question, the CDC reported earlier this month the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6845e2.htm?s_cid=mm6845e2_w">results</a> of tests on 29 randomly collected samples of lung fluid in patients hospitalized for vaping-related illness. All 29 samples contained vitamin E acetate, the synthetic form of vitamin E. Vitamin E acetate is an oil, and is suitable for ingesting, but can cause severe lung damage if inhaled.</p>
      <p>Vitamin E acetate is commonly used as the vehicle for delivering THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, in vaping cartridges. The CDC <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/health/vaping-illness-cdc.html">reported</a> that 86 percent of the patients sampled said they had vaped an illegal THC product. This was based upon self-reporting, so the actual percentage may be higher.</p>
      <p>Vitamin E acetate is not used by legal e-cigarette cartridge makers because of its harmful effects on the lungs. Its presence in vaping liquid indicates a black-market source.</p>
      <p>As long as federal marijuana prohibition continues, <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/cdc-study-vaping-related-lung-injuries-strengthens-case-cannabis-legalization">the only way</a> for vapers to get THC-containing liquids is by making them on their own with cannabis products or buying them in the dangerous black market.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the CDC test results, Professor Siegel <a href="https://tobaccoanalysis.blogspot.com/2019/11/cdc-announces-major-breakthrough-that-i.html">stated</a>, “states which have issued emergency regulations to ban e-cigarettes or flavored e-cigarettes are not justified in using their emergency powers for this purpose since it is almost assuredly the case that those store-bought products have nothing to do with the outbreak.”</p>
      <p>Flavored vaping liquids are very popular among teen vapers. But they are also the choice of <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-the-vaping-panic-is-out-of-hand-20190920-ll6djbwnczffbphckaqjflxa3i-story.html">more than 90 percent</a> of adult tobacco smokers wanting to quit. One former tobacco smoker, who now vapes tells me, “Why should I choose tobacco flavored vaping liquid when I can experience the real thing from a cigarette?”</p>
      <p>A ban on flavored vaping not only harms adult tobacco smokers wishing to quit. It also harm teens.</p>
      <p>It has been federally illegal to sell e-cigarettes to persons under 18 since 2016. Yet teens manage to obtain e-cigarettes and cartridges. Oftentimes they obtain bootleg products on the black market made with dangerous substances such as vitamin E acetate. The Drug Enforcement Administration recently <a href="https://kutv.com/news/local/dea-warns-about-nearly-undetectable-drugs-in-vape-cartridges">reported</a> that the Mexican drug cartels are getting into the bootleg vaping business, and some of their products are <a href="https://fox13now.com/2019/11/01/fentanyl-found-in-unregulated-vape-cartridges-in-other-states-just-a-matter-of-time-before-it-comes-to-utah/">laced</a> with illicit fentanyl. An outright ban on the sale of legally produced vaping cartridges can only make matters <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/war-drugs-meets-war-vaping-wont-end-well">worse</a>.</p>
