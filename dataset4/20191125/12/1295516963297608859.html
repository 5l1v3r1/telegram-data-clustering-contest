      <h3>COMIC LEGEND:</h3>
      <p>Ed Hannigan accidentally left out a clue to a murderer's identity because he didn't know it was meant to be a clue at the time.</p>
      <h3>STATUS:</h3>
      <p>True</p>
      <p>In Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight #3 (by Denny O'Neil, Ed Hannigan and John Beatty), <a href="https://screenrant.com/new-batman-dc-comic-changes-2020/">Batman</a> is attacked by a mysterious masked man. The man's knife appears to be a big deal...</p>

      <p>In the final issue of the storyline, Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight #5, the knife is once again a prominent feature of the bad guy's repertoire...</p>

      <p>This makes sense. You see, in the first issue of the story, set two years before Bruce Wayne became Batman, he was learning tracking skills from one of the world's best bounty hunters in the wilderness of Alaska when they are suddenly attacked by the man that they are hunting. He kills the bounty hunter before seemingly dying himself, leaving Bruce Wayne abandoned in the freezing cold with no chance at survival (he is saved by some Native Americans and their Shaman seemingly uses mysticism to heal Bruce). However, the man survives and turns out to be the villain in the later issue. This is shown by the unique knife that he uses in the scene in the past in issue #1.</p>
      <p>Oh...wait...there IS no knife in that scene!</p>

      <p>Hannigan explained the situation to his old collaborator, David A. Kraft, in Kraft's iconic magazine, Comics Interview. O'Neil had written the script so that the bad guy has a rifle in one hand and then attacks Bruce with the knife in his other hand and Hannigan thought it made no sense, as he would have to drop the rifle to do so, and so Hannigan just eliminated the knife from the scene. You see, O'Neil was sending Hannigan's scripts for the issues as he drew them, so it was not until Hannigan got the script for #3 that he realized that the knife was supposed to be a clue!</p>
      <p>Hannigan then tried to adjust by making the villain's distinctive pants a clue in #3...</p>

        <img src="https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lotdk-3-1.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=1480&amp;dpr=1.5"/>

      <p>And he also had editor Andy Helfer add that word balloon where the bad guy says, "I cut you," as a sort of allusion to the first scene from #1.</p>
      <p>As Hannigan notes, we find out that it is the guy in the next issue (before he attacks Batman in #5), so it is not a huge deal, but it is still pretty funny.</p>
      <p>Thanks to Ed Hannigan and David A. Kraft for the information!</p>
