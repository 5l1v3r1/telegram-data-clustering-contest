      <h1>Transfer News: Chelsea lining up January move for Fedor Chalov</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:19:10+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/author/abhishek_b/" target="_blank">Abhisek Bajaj</a></address>
      <h3>Chelsea are reportedly lining up a January move for CSKA Moscow striker Fedor Chalov, provided that the Blues’ transfer ban is lifted in time.</h3>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/chelsea-to-make-january-move-20941273">The Mirror</a>, Fedor Chalov is once again being brought up as a name; as a target for one of the European bigwigs. The club in question this time around is Premier League giants Chelsea, who are reportedly looking to bring in the CSKA Moscow forward in January, with the potential of it depending on the success of their appeal at CAS.</p>
      <p>Chelsea are still under a transfer ban imposed by FIFA for breaching rules over registration and signing of youth players. Their appeal at CAS is set to be heard, with the Blues expecting a positive result. If the ban is overturned before the winter transfer window, Frank Lampard is looking to strengthen his side in order to boost their chances of retaining their top four spot and perhaps, more depth.</p>

      <p>Fedor Chalov is one of the in-form stars in Europe at the moment. The Russian international had a 15-goal league season in 2018-19, bagging the Top scorer award in the Russian Premier League for CSKA Moscow and has continued to exude the same kind of swagger and form in attack in the coming season.</p>
      <p>5 goals and 4 assists in 17 league matches so far and the interest in his services has genuinely been constant, thanks to his exploits in attack for CSKA Moscow. While there have been a flurry of Premier League clubs linked to him in the past, Chelsea are now the ones rumoured to be eyeing a move for the 21-year-old.</p>
      <p>Chelsea have Tammy Abraham firing on all cylinders. But, apart from the academy ace, <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/11/23/transfer-news-crystal-palace-unwilling-to-meet-olivier-giroud-transfer-demands/">Olivier Giroud is certain to head towards an exit</a> in January or summer 2020. Michy Batshuayi has been a good game-changer for Chelsea to bring on. But, the Belgian lacks that bit of quality to challenge Tammy for the starting spot.</p>
      <p>Fedor Chalov could be the long-term candidate or competitor for Tammy Abraham’s starting spot. Tipped to be the next Russian star, the 21-year-old is set to be in demand in the upcoming transfer window(s). It will be interesting to see if Chelsea do go on the offensive to land the CSKA Moscow star if their transfer ban is indeed lifted before January.</p>
