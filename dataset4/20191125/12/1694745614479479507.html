      <h1>Adjust Your DVR: Grey's Anatomy Is Moving Back to Its Original Time in January</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:10:03+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:10</time> by <a rel="author">Mekishana Pierre</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Grey%E2%80%99s-Anatomy"><b>Grey's Anatomy</b></a> just wrapped up <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/greys-anatomy-season-16-fall-finale-recap-spoilers-46933912">the first half of season 16</a>, and it's fair to say the Fall finale left fans on their toes. Thankfully, we don't have to wait too long to get back to Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital; the series will return for its midseason premiere on Jan. 23. But rather than leading the charge on Thursday night — as the series has since season 11 — <b>Grey's</b> is moving from 8 p.m. to its original 9 p.m. time slot.</p>
      <p>The change comes thanks to the return of <b>Station 19</b>, the first-responder spinoff series. <b>Station 19</b> will kick off ABC's Thursdays, with <b>Grey's</b> following, and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/A-Million-Little-Things"><b>A Million Little Things</b></a> shifting to 10 p.m. until it <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Million-Little-Things-Season-2-Theories-46300138">wraps up its sophomore season</a> in March. Then <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/How-Get-Away-Murder-Cancelled-46366067"><b>How to Get Away With Murder</b> will reclaim the 10 p.m. slot</a> to finish off the remainder of its final season. And to start off the new lineup with a bang, <b>Station 19</b> and <b>Grey's</b> <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/photo-gallery/46933912/image/46933921/Car-Crashes-Through-Bar-Window">will stage a two-hour crossover special</a> following <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/photo-gallery/46933912/embed/46933930/embed">the events of <b>Grey's</b> Fall finale</a>.</p>
      <p>So, enjoy your holiday folks! We have a lot to look forward to when <b>Grey's</b> returns on Jan. 23 at 9 p.m.</p>
