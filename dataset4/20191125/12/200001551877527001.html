      <h1>Everton player with cool Marco Silva relationship – Claim he now ‘Awaits his successor’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:37:23+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Moise Kean failed to get off the bench for Everton during the club’s 2-0 defeat to Norwich City at the weekend. It was progress from the game against Southampton, when he wasn’t included in the match-day squad.</p>
      <p>The last minutes the Italian got in the Premier League came against West Ham in mid-October, when Marco Silva gave him 4. That helped add up to 288 minutes in the league so far this season, and a further 119 in the EFL Cup.</p>
      <p>There’s been a lot of talk about a potential return to Serie A as soon as the January transfer window, and despite Kean saying last week that his mind is set on getting more minutes at Everton, those claims are likely to continue.</p>
      <p>Following Norwich’s victory over the Toffees, <a href="https://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Estero/24-11-2019/everton-esonera-silva-successore-dipende-futuro-kean-3501352442343.shtml">Gazzetta dello Sport</a> reported Silva is a step away from the sack, and Kean ‘awaits his successor’.</p>
      <p>Whilst that may be an easy assumption to make, the interesting thing to take from Gazzetta’s story is a claim the player doesn’t have a good relationship with his manager at Everton.</p>
      <p>Therefore the hope would be that whoever may succeed Silva will change things for Kean.</p>
