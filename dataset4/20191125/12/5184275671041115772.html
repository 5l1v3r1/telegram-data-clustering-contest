      <p>“I get annoyed when there are warped pictures of me, where they will enhance certain things and make me look bigger than I actually am. If I have put on weight, it’s fine. But I have dealt with bullying since I was 13-14. That’s a vulnerable and sensitive age because you’re just starting to talk to boys. I have been harassed by my body type so much that I think I have heard it all. I just didn’t like it because I was looking at myself from that person’s perspective. People would be like, ‘This isn’t normal’, why do you have a body like that?’ I have reached that point where I’m happy. It’s entertaining and funny.”</p>
      <p>She further added, “I recently read a comment which said, ‘I don’t like her arms’. And I’m like, I don’t like them too, but they aren’t that bad.”</p>
      <p>On the work front, she will be next seen in <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-news/the-big-bull-tumbbad-sohum-shah-thrilled-part-of-abhishek-bachchan/"><i>The Big Bull</i></a> opposite Abhishek Bachchan.</p>
