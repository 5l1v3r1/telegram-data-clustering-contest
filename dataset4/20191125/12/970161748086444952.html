      <p>Charlie’s Angels opens in the UK this week with a sputter, rather than a bang, having tanked in the US with an opening of just $8.6million (£6.7million). It’s shaping up to be one of the bigger bombs of the year, but does it deserve the disdain?</p>
      <p>The film stars Naomi Scott as Elena, a scientist who blows the whistle on her employers, who are planning to release a revolutionary alternative energy device despite knowing it has a dangerous flaw. She is taken under the protection of The Townsend Agency, and their ‘Angel’ operatives Sabina (Kristen Stewart) and Jane (Ella Balinska). Elena joins The Angels and their superior, Bosley (Elizabeth Banks, who also directs), to find the device before it is used for evil.</p>
      <p>It’s hard to imagine who is desperately awaiting the return of Charlie’s Angels. It’s four decades since the TV show was popular, and almost two since Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz rebooted it for the big screen.</p>

      <p>A great spy caper with strong female leads is always welcome, but sadly this is not a great spy caper. It’s not terrible, but the mediocrity of the plot makes it instantly forgettable.</p>

      <p>It starts well enough with a pre-credit sequence where Stewart and Balinska take down an international smuggler. It’s nicely pitched and leads to the film’s neat premise that links to the series and previous films. Once we have that premise, however, very little is done to build on it.</p>
      <p>The cast glide through dull action scenes, which aspire to achieve something between Ocean’s 11 slickness and Mission: Impossible-style stunts. In reality, they are robotic and bog down the middle act, with the stars doing their best to forge some kind of chemistry between the unnecessarily complicated obstacles.</p>
      <p>They are also let down by a script that doesn’t really know what to do with itself. Bland enemies, such as Sam Claflin’s shouty CEO, don’t exactly raise the stakes, while comic relief can be hit and miss. The Saint (Luis Gerardo Méndez), the Angels’ wellness-obsessed assistant, just doesn’t work.</p>

      <p>A third act twist makes things slightly interesting, but not enough to save the previous hour and a half. More disappointing than all this, however, is how the film delivers its message of female empowerment, via insincere montages and silly quips. It feels like a corporate approach to what should be a heartfelt message.</p>

      <p>There are moments to enjoy, most of them coming from Stewart in a fun performance. As wise-cracking Sabina, she is every bit the cool secret agent you want to follow on an adventure. It’s refreshing to see the star take on a role that’s not so serious, and succeed.</p>
      <p>Many of her co-stars struggle with what they have to work with. Patrick Stewart is erratic as the original Bosley, while Balinska’s role as the tough Angel means she doesn’t get to develop as a character until late in the film. Scott is effective as the audience’s point-of-view, but too much of her time is wasted simply reacting to the things happening to her.</p>
      <p>Charlie’s Angels isn’t the worst film you’ll see this year, but it’s horrifically bland. A studio supervised action movie which feels formulaic throughout, Stewart’s surprise star turn can’t gloss over the fact that this is one team that’s unlikely to get a second mission.</p>
