      <h2>Sally Stokes fled the family home in Hinckley, Leicestershire, after her husband David stabbed her and then found out the next day that he had killed their sons and taken his own life</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:57:14+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:57</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, Tom Mack, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>A mum fought for her life as she was smothered and knifed by her estranged husband who killed their two sons before taking his own life, an inquest heard.</p>
      <p>Sally Stokes told the hearing that her husband David smashed her over the head with a rolling pin and put a pillow over her face after she returned home in Hinckley, Leics., on the night of November 1, 2016.</p>
      <p>Giving harrowing evidence, she said she demanded to see their sons Matthew, five and Adam, 11, fearing they were in danger, before hitting David with the rolling pin, <a href="https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/updates-inquests-deaths-dad-2-3574065">LeicestershireLive</a> reports.</p>
      <p>He dragged her back inside the house as she tried to flee and then stabbed her in the side with a look of "satisfaction" after telling the police he would shoot her, the inquest heard.</p>
      <p>Wounded Mrs Stokes finally managed to escape through the front door and police later found the bodies of David, 43, Matthew and Adam early on November 2 following an hours-long stand-off.</p>

      <p>When the inquest opened a few days after the deaths, it heard that David died as a result of a stab wound to the chest.</p>
      <p>The children's post-mortem examinations were inconclusive, Loughborough Coroner's Court heard.</p>
      <p>Mrs Stokes fled the three-bed semi-detached house around five hours after police were called to reports of a woman screaming.</p>
      <p>As the hearing resumed on Monday, Mrs Stokes said she and her "controlling" and mentally abusive husband had separated three months before the attack after a number of problems in the marriage.</p>
      <p>She said he was “on dating sites and going on dates” while she was at home with the boys, was seeing prostitutes and had been looking at websites for escorts and date rape drugs.</p>
      <p>She said she found a second mobile phone and lottery tickets he had hidden, and he had been out spending money after telling her they didn't have the finances.</p>

      <p>On the day of the attack, Mrs Stokes phoned David and told him she had called the police about the date rape drug “to see what his response was”.</p>
      <p>David and his father went to the house and Mrs Stokes confronted him about seeing prostitutes before they separated.</p>
      <p>she went out at about 6pm and when she returned about three hours later David followed her upstairs and hit her on the back of the head with the rolling pin.</p>
      <p>He then tried to put a pillow over her face to smother her in their bed, but she managed to wriggle away from him.</p>
      <p>As David tried to force her to put cable ties on her hands and ankles, she demanded to see their sons, the inquest heard.</p>

      <p>Mrs Stokes told the hearing: “At that moment I thought, ‘I’m going to die’.”</p>
      <p>There was another struggle when she refused to put the cable ties on herself.</p>
      <p>Mrs Stokes said: “He went to hit me but I held onto the rolling pin and said I need to see them.</p>
      <p>“He said, ‘No. I’ve laid things out for later. We’ll see how the night goes’.”</p>
      <p>She added: “This was someone I never thought could ever lay a hand on me.”</p>
      <p>The mum got the rolling pin off David, hit him on the side of the head and ran into the back garden screaming for help.</p>
      <p>She said: “I thought, 'I’ve got to get out, I’ve got to let someone know I was in danger' - the kids were in danger.”</p>
      <p>“He pushed me across the patio and smashed my head into the wall.</p>
      <p>“I was screaming and I said his name so people would know it was me.</p>
      <p>“He dragged me back into the house and made a joke."</p>

      <p>David told her: “I can’t believe you just hit me in the head. I’m going to get a real big egg on my head now."</p>
      <p>She added: “It was as if he’d done nothing. I got really agitated because I couldn’t get out of the house.”</p>
      <p>Police arrived a short time later and the situation developed into an hours-long siege.</p>
      <p>David told her to "be quiet" when there was a knock on the door and when officers rang the house he told them to leave him to speak to his wife, the inquest heard.</p>
      <p>She said: “He told them he just wanted to talk to me but we weren’t talking.</p>
      <p>“It went on and on, waiting for the next phone call but we weren’t talking.”</p>

      <p>Mrs Stokes said David then armed himself with a kitchen knife and told the police he had a gun and would shoot his wife.</p>
      <p>She said she didn't know if he had a gun, adding: “I told him we could just tell the police we had a domestic.</p>
      <p>“He told the police he had a gun and he was going to shoot me and I said, ‘You’ve just made things 10 times worse’.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know what he was capable of at all.”</p>
      <p>Mrs Stokes and David were standing at the top of the stairs when he stabbed her in the side.</p>

      <p>She said: “I felt a bump in my back. I felt the warmth and put my hand there and realised he had stabbed me.</p>
      <p>“The look on his face was like satisfaction as if he’d kind of won. I’ll never forget that.</p>
      <p>“I felt the blood and looked at him and said his name.”</p>
      <p>She then fled down the stairs and ran out the front door. David had left the key in the lock.</p>
      <p>Mrs Stokes said: “I opened it and ran out screaming and saying, ‘He stabbed me’. They took me over the road."</p>
      <p>The mum, who suffered major internal bleeding, was taken to the hospital with no idea afterwards what had happened to her sons or her husband.</p>

      <p>Recalling her conversation with a doctor, she asked "could I die" and he said "yes", the inquest heard.</p>
      <p>Mrs Stokes described the moment she found out her sons and David were dead.</p>
      <p>She said: “They told me the following day about Adam and Matthew and that David had killed himself.”</p>
      <p>After recalling the events that night, she thanked Leicestershire Police for the way they handled the situation.</p>
      <p>She said: “People say, 'Why didn’t the police get in earlier?'</p>
      <p>“My opinion is that if the police had forced the situation more, I wouldn’t be here.”</p>
      <p>Mrs Stokes was discharged from hospital a week after the attack.</p>
      <p>When the hearing resumed on Monday, coroner Tanyka Rawden warned that it would not be able to answer “why” the father and two sons died.</p>
      <p>The inquest continues.</p>
