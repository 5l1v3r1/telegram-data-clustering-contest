      <p>The 67-year-old said he has a ‘nice part’ in the upcoming film, which is due to be released in 2021.</p>
      <p>Jeff revealed: ‘Yes, I have a nice part in it.’</p>
      <p>The Thor actor then praised Jurassic World’s director, Colin Trevorrow as ‘so wonderful’.</p>
      <p>‘He’s going to write in and direct it,’ he told <a href="https://collider.com/jeff-goldblum-interview-the-world-according-to-jeff-goldblum/">Collider</a>.</p>

      <p>Jeff originally played the role of Dr Ian Malcolm in Jurassic Park (1993), then The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018).</p>
      <p>This will make the fourth film he’s played the brainy Ian Malcolm, out of six films in the franchise.</p>
      <p>It was revealed last year <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/09/13/jeff-goldblum-was-nearly-written-out-of-jurassic-park-by-steven-spielberg-7941139/">Jeff’s iconic Jurassic Park role almost never came about</a>.</p>
      <p>Jeff confessed that Steven revealed that his character and that of Sam Neill’s, Dr Alan Grant, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/09/13/jeff-goldblum-was-nearly-written-out-of-jurassic-park-by-steven-spielberg-7941139/">were set to get merged into one during a cast roundtable</a>.</p>
      <p>‘When I first met Steven Spielberg at Amblin, he came in and said, “You know, there’s a movement afoot, a new rewrite is happening, and your character, Ian Malcolm, is being written out,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘We probably wanna give these funny lines and kinda incorporate your character into the Sam Neil character.”’</p>
      <p>Thank god that didn’t happen.</p>
