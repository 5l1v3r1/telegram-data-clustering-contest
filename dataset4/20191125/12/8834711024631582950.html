      <h1>DA Gauteng Leader Moodey Meets With Mokgalapa Over Audio Scandal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:45:28+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/neelket/" target="_blank">NT Editor</a></address>
      <p>The Democratic Alliance (DA)’s Gauteng leader John Moodey was locked in a meeting with Tshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa on Monday.</p>
      <p>Mokgalapa is expected to explain his side of leaked audio recordings and claims of an inappropriate relationship with his colleague.</p>
      <p>The woman implicated in the scandal, Roads and Transport MMC Sheila Senkubuge, will meet with Moodey separately on Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The audio clip, widely circulated on social media, purports to be a conversation between the pair and allegedly includes an intimate exchange between them.</p>
      <p>Mokgalapa has opened a criminal case at the Brooklyn police station against disgruntled former employees, whom he claims are behind the illegal recordings.</p>
      <p>Moodey said after the internal investigation had been concluded, he would submit a feedback report.</p>
      <p>“Emanating from what I get from them, I will be giving a report to the party leader and the interim leader. James Selfe and I will take a decision on the way forward.”</p>
