      <h3>Selena's Matching Tatt</h3>
      <p>This weekend as she was prepping to head to the American Music Awards, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/selenagomez/">Selena Gomez</a> uploaded a few pictures of her outfit to Instagram.</p>
      <p>The cute Polaroid collage featured the singers evening dress but that was not the only thing she included.</p>

      <p>In the bottom left hand corner of the post she included what appears to be a new tattoo.</p>
      <p>The 27 year old already has a few tattoos but fans spotted something different about this one.</p>

      <p>The tattoo on her upper thigh is almost identical to her ex-boyfriend<a href="https://www.instagram.com/justinbieber/?hl=en"> Justin Bieber's</a> leg tattoo.</p>
      <p>Both tattoos are of clasped praying hands with the only difference being that Selena chose to include rosary beads in hers.</p>

      <p>It's a popular tattoo design but there is no doubting that this is a pretty big coincidence.</p>
      <h3>The song mashup</h3>
      <p>Only a few weeks ago fans were swooning over a mashup that appeared on YouTube of one of Selena and Justin's songs.</p>
      <p>The mix included Gomez's new single <i>Lose You To Love Me</i> and Bieber's hit single <i>Sorry</i>.</p>
