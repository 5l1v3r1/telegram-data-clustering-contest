      <p>Waikato Regional Council staff have this morning deployed booms to prevent the spread of fuel leaking from a stormwater pipe into the Waikato River.</p>
      <p>Members of the public contacted the council about 8am after seeing a sheen on the water immediately below its Hamilton East offices.</p>
      <p>Staff from the council’s incident response team were deployed, with the source of the fuel being identified – a 200 litre drum containing what appears to be waste oil on shared business premises on Grey Street.</p>
      <p>The leak from the drum has been stopped and the circumstances of it being there are being looked into.</p>
