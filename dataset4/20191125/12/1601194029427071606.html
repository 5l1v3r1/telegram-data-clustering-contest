      <p>Sergio Aguero will miss the Manchester derby with a thigh problem sustained in the win over Chelsea, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has confirmed.</p>
      <p>Aguero was forced off with the injury in the 77th minute of City's 2-1 victory in the Premier League on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Guardiola informed reporters after the match that he believed Aguero's injury was "bad" but could not provide any further details.</p>
      <p>However, in his news conference to preview City's Champions League meeting with Shakhtar Donetsk, Guardiola confirmed Aguero will be out of action for several weeks, meaning the striker - who has scored nine league goals this term - will miss the clash with Manchester United on December 7.</p>
      <p>"Yes," Guardiola responded when asked if City would be without Aguero for the derby.</p>
      <p>"He will be out for a few games, don't know exactly [how long], a few weeks, but he'll be out."</p>

      <p>Guardiola was unable to pinpoint Aguero's exact issue, but suggested the problem was a muscular one in the striker's thigh.</p>
      <p>"Exactly where I don't know, his [thigh] tendon, at the front."</p>
