      <p>“<a href="https://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-news/pal-pal-dil-ke-paas-sunny-deols-son-karan-deol-ho-jaa-awara-song/"><i>Pal Pal Dil Ke Pass</i></a>” actress Sahher Bambba has turned vegan. She calls it her “best decision”.</p>
      <p>“I turned vegan a few months ago and I think it is the best decision I have made. I was vegetarian for the longest time but being vegan is a lifestyle so rich in nutrients while being extremely light on the stomach. I am now more aware of what goes into my body and how that changes the way I look and feel from within and outside,” she said.</p>

      <p>“It’s a huge myth that when you turn to be a vegan, you don’t get your adequate protein. There are so many athletes in this country and outside who are vegans. They need lots of protein every day and they achieve it while following a vegan diet,” she added.</p>
      <p>Sahher also feels better as a person after turning vegan.</p>
      <p>“The feeling of having clean food takes care of my mental as well as physical well-being,” she said.</p>
