      <p>KK Fosu added he has sold five albums to that effect and is currently signed up with ‘Worldmap Records’ owned by Frank Gogo.</p>
      <p>According to KK Fosu, he will continue to support young and upcoming artistes as it is his goal to ensure that the youth would continue to appreciate our leaders in the music industry.</p>
      <p>KK Fosu in his final statement advised artists to make sure they come up with tracks that can be played for a long time because gone are the days when the radio stations were less.  Currently there are at least 50 radio and TV stations across the country which will make it easier for their songs to receive the necessary airwaves.</p>
