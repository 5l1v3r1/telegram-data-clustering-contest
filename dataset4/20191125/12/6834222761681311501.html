      <p>It's not only the MotoGPs that are testing in Spain the next couple of days. ile WhMarquez and partners are in Jerez, there are other bikes undergoing much more secret tests just a few hundred kilometers away. <b>Honda has chosen the Aragon circuit to debut with its new Superbike CBR 1000 RR-R Fireblade.</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>Alvaro Bautista and Leon Haslam will be able to try out the new bike for two days, away from prying eyes. The circuit is, in fact, off limits, and neither photos nor other information will be made public.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Honda has decided not to bring its bike to the track Thursday and Friday with the competition in Jerez. It prefers to work alone on developing its weapon, which will be used to besiege the World SBK.</p>
      <p><b>The CBR is debutting in Europe, after initial tests performed by the Japanese test</b> <b>riders</b>. Unfortunately, it'll be difficult to see images of the bike, and we'll have to wait till next year for Alvaro Bautista's comments.</p>
