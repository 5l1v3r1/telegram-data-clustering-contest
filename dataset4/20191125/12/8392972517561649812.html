      <p>Jacqueline Jossa's mum has begged <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> viewers to stop voting her for Bushtucker Trials.</p>
      <p>Concerned mother Selina has followed calls from the former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> star's husband Dan Osborne after he pleaded with fans to back off, and now she has urged people to "vote for someone else".</p>

      <p>She told the Mirror Online: "It is a lot for her. I think she has proven herself so they could vote for someone else.</p>
      <p>"There are trials where they all take part and she is doing them as well as the other ones. She needs a little break."</p>
      <p>However, Selina thinks she could be partly to blame for this as she admitted they have such a "big family" who were all told to vote for Jacqueline.</p>
      <p>She admitted: "It is partly my fault because we have got a really big family in Ireland and I think they all keep voting for her because I told them to at the start."</p>

      </p>
      <p>Selina's comments come after Dan made a similar plea on social media as he asked fans to stop choosing her for horrible tasks on the jungle show.</p>
      <p>In a video posted online, he said: "Give her a break please because she's getting upset now. I know I said you all vote for Jac cos she's ain't in there to change lightbulbs - but I didn't mean every single trial.</p>
      <p>"Give her a break now, come on. But she keeps smashing them all. She's worried about it but she'll smash it.</p>
      <p>"She'll keep proving, everyone. Let her do this one then give her a break please because she's getting upset now and it ain't nice. But she'll get all the stars, smash it and then go back and have a nice dinner."</p>
      <p>His comments come after Jacqueline was voted to do the Crevice of Cruelty trial.</p>
