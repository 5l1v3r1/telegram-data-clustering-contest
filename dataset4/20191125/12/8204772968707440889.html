      <h2>INMO says 85 patients waiting Monday morning in University Hospital Limerick</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:49:55+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/sarah-burns-7.4048147" target="_blank">Sarah Burns</a></address>
      <p>There were 85 patients waiting on trolleys in University Hospital <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Limerick">Limerick</a> on Monday morning, the highest figure ever recorded in an Irish hospital in a single day, according to the Irish Nurses and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Midwives+Organisation">Midwives Organisation</a> (INMO).</p>
      <p>The INMO said 55 people were waiting on trolleys in the emergency department, while 30 were in wards elsewhere in the hospital.</p>
      <p>The previous record for the highest number of people waiting on trolleys in a single day was 82, also recorded in Limerick last month.</p>
      <p>In total, 631 people were waiting on trolleys in hospital emergency departments or on wards across the country this morning, including 22 children.</p>
      <p>Cork University Hospital had 52 patients waiting on trolleys, followed by <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Letterkenny+University">Letterkenny University</a> Hospital (47), <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Tallaght+University">Tallaght University</a> Hospital (36) and University Hospital Galway (33).</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mary+Fogarty">Mary Fogarty</a>, INMO assistant director of industrial relations for the region, said despite the “best efforts” of local staff, the situation in Limerick “continues to escalate”.</p>
      <p>“The hospital is breaking records in the worst possible way. Promises of future improvement will not suffice. Real action is needed today,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We simply do not have sufficient capacity. Without an increase in beds and the professionals to staff them, this problem will continue to escalate.</p>
      <p>“Our members are on the frontline providing the best care they can - but the situation is intolerable for them and unsafe for patients.”</p>
      <p>The INMO has called for a “direct, immediate intervention” from senior management at University Hospital Limerick including the cancellation of non-essential elective work, more home care packages and emergency funding for extra agency staff.</p>
      <p>The organisation has also called for an immediate end to the recruitment ban for nurses and midwives and extra support for GPs and public health nurses.</p>
