      <p>Just in time for many people’s annual Thanksgiving-week viewing of <i>The Last Waltz</i>, the Band’s Robbie Robertson has released some actual holiday music. Robertson, who released his <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2052584/robbie-robertson-i-hear-you-paint-houses-feat-van-morrison/music/"><i>Sinematic</i></a> album earlier this year, has now shared “Happy Holidays.” He’s promoting as an irreverent Christmas tune, which explains lyrics like, “Never ever eat the yellow snow.”</p>
      <p>The musical vibe, though, is sufficiently reflective and sentimental — think <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1964878/time-out-of-mind-turns-20/franchises/the-anniversary/"><i>Time Out Of Mind</i></a>, but next to a crackling fireplace. In a press release, Robertson writes, “We love Christmas and the holidays, it brings good cheer, and also stress and depression, so I wanted to do a song that celebrates both sides and have a little fun.” Listen below and imagine what this might sound like in a War On Drugs setlist.</p>
