      <p>NEW YORK — Airbnb is launching a global search for 100 top home cooks and treating them to a trip to Italy to learn how to refine their recipes with teachers including David Chang and his mom.</p>
      <p>The lucky chosen will travel to the University of Gastronomic Sciences in Pollenzo, Italy, for a week’s worth of workshops and tastings to take their food “to the next level.” Their recipe will also feature in Airbnb’s first cookbook.</p>
      <p>Applications open Monday. Airbnb users who are 18 and a resident of one of 30 or so eligible countries can nominate their favourite home cooks and complete an essay. Applications close Dec. 23.</p>
      <p>Winners will be selected by judges from representatives from Airbnb, the Slow Food organization and the University of Gastronomic Sciences.</p>
