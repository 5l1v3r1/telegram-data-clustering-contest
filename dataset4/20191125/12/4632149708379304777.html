      <p><b>Chennai: </b>RSS ideologue and Editor of Tughlak magazine S Gurumurthy on Sunday claimed that he was behind O Panneerselvam's revolt or "fight for justice" against the official faction of the AIADMK soon after late leader J Jayalalithaa's death in 2017. <br/><br/>The video of his speech, while addressing the golden jubilee commemorative event of the magazine, at Tiruchy, had gone viral drawing flak from the ruling AIADMK. <br/><br/>Gurumurthy reportedly said that when all arrangements were on to make VK Sasikala as chief minister he asked Panneerselvam, "Are you a man?" When Panneerselvam asked him what else to do, he told him to go and sit at Jayalalithaa's samadhi and he will get some idea there. <br/><br/>Gurumurthy claimed that his call to Panneerselvam to sit on a dharna at Jayalalithaa's samadhi prompted a change in Tamil Nadu politics. He also claimed that he had a role in unifying the two rival factions of AIADMK led by Edappadi Palaniswamy and O Panneerselvam. <br/><br/><br/>With his remarks against Panneerselvam for "not being man enough" to take on the Sasikala faction, he stoked a controversy. Fisheries minister D Jayakumar described the remarks as "height of arrogance". Gurumurthy later clarified that his comments were not made to disrespect Panneerselvam. <br/><br/>Gurumurthy took to twitter on Monday and wrote, "When I spoke to OPS, I was not talking to him in any disrespectful way. I only talked to him saying why the AIADMK people are prostrating to Sasikala with no courage. OPS knows what I meant and he is the one who retrieved the AIADMK from Sasikala and that is why I have so much respect for him," Gurumurthy noted.</p>
