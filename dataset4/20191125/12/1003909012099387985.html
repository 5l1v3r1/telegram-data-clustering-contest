      <h3>Listen to the front line; cut from the top instead</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: CBE cutting 300 teachers in wake of UCP budget, Nov. 20</b>
      </p>
      <p>I moved to Alberta in 1976 and two challenges keep popping up every election, that being school board budgets and health care. Neither have yet to be solved!  In support to Don Braid’s column, it seems like priorities and budgets never include the top-heavy bureaucracy! Why are we cutting the workers as they are not the problem?</p>
      <p>I have more than 23 schools within a three-kilometre radius of our home and every school has a principal. Why? We have vice-principals who could cover the schools and surely one principal could cover at least two to three schools in their area? For health care, just listen to the doctors and nurses as they know where the bureaucracy is. It’s obvious that the management at the top of both education and health care haven’t solved the problem, so perhaps they should be the ones cut and not teachers and nurses!</p>

      <h3>Kenney had chance to fix equalization while in Ottawa</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: Kenney needs to play it cool; Premier the best hope of chilling heat from Wexit, Nov. 19</b>
      </p>
      <p>How come during the Harper government, for 10 years in Ottawa, when Jason Kenney was one of the ministers, they didn’t fix this equalization payment situation? And now that another party is in Ottawa, Kenney is getting crazy about this. The people of Alberta should sue him instead of suing Ottawa.</p>
      <p>Kenney, please lower your rhetoric. After the federal election, Kenney demanded the building of the pipeline. You could have said the ‘people of Alberta and I want assurance of the building of the pipeline.’</p>

      <h3>Some called it</h3>
      <p>While we desperately tried to warn Albertans about what Liberal turned Reformer Jason Kenney would do to us, we got called all sorts of names by many of our fellow seniors. Everything we said would happen is happening. The people didn’t care that he was being investigated by the RCMP; we did.</p>
      <p>He accused Rachel Notley of spending too much money, yet he is spending it faster than she did. In true dictator fashion, he punished the Alberta Energy Regulator for bringing the billion-dollar orphan well mess to the attention of the public by slashing their budget, and has now fired Election Commissioner Lorne Gibson for fining one-time UCP leadership candidate Jeff Callaway and others for allegedly funnelling money into the ‘kamikaze’ leadership campaign.</p>
      <p>In short, he has treated his supporters like morons for supporting him and done the exact opposite of what he said he would.</p>

      <h3>Wanting out</h3>
      <p>The West is highly entrepreneurial and filled with talented people. Independence will not be easy but we have the people and strength to do it. It will immediately diversify our economy by producing tens of thousands of jobs. It will immeasurably enhance our negotiating position with B.C. Tit for tat or access for access if you prefer. It will give us an opportunity to carefully consider how things are structured and perhaps resolve problems and renew our relationship with First Nations.</p>
      <p>It might be hard but not near as hard as continuing as part of the failed nation of Canada.</p>
