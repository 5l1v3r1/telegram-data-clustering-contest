      <p>After Haslegrave retired from playing he went into coaching and for many years was a coach at Cardinal Newman College’s football centre of excellence in Preston.</p>
      <p>In 2012, he did a 1,500-mile solo charity walk from Preston to Santiago de Compostela in Spain to raise money to send sick children on a pilgrimage to Lourdes.</p>
      <p>Haslegrave started his career with home-town club Stoke, before Brian Clough signed him for Nottingham Forest in 1975.</p>
      <p>North End swooped for his services in September 1977 and he made his debut in a 2-0 win over Cambridge, setting up a goal for Mick Baxter.</p>

      <p>He played every game to the end of the season as Preston were promoted in third place from Division Three under Nobby Stiles.</p>
      <p>When PNE finished seventh in their first season back in the Second Division, Haslegrave played 46 games in league and cup.</p>
      <p>Recalling that era in an interview with the Lancashire Evening Post in 2004, Haslegrave said: “That team had fantastic solidarity, smashing players like Ricky Thomson, Steve Doyle, Mike Elwiss, Alex Bruce and the late Mick Baxter.</p>
      <p>"Ricky was a class act, while Bruce was a cut-throat striker - he was a great finisher, and I always used to admire his ability in front of goal.</p>
      <p>"The Mike Elwiss and Alex Bruce partnership was a special one, and we played some really good football for a couple of seasons.</p>
      <p>"We knocked First Division Derby out of the FA Cup 3-0 and thrashed Charlton 6-1 in one of the best team performances I ever played in.</p>
      <p>“I had a bushy moustache in those days and the lads used to tease me, saying I looked like an out-of-work Mexican bandit. We had some real laughs at Deepdale.”</p>
      <p>Haslegrave left North End in 1981 after the club were relegated, going on to play for Crewe, York and Torquay.</p>
      <p>He was in the York side which won the Fourth Division title in 1983/84 with a record points haul.</p>
      <p>When Haslegrave joined Torquay, he ended-up as assistant manager to Cyril Knowles.</p>
