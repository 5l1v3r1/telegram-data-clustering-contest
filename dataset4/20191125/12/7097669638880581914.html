      <h1>Joe Biden: Stacey Abrams, Sally Yates could be potential vice president picks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:39:29+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/" target="_blank">Stephen Gruber-Miller, Des Moines Register</a></address>
      <p>WINTERSET, Iowa — <a href="http://bit.ly/33fD0Sh">Former Vice President Joe Biden</a> on Friday night identified several prominent Democratic women who he said could serve as his vice president if he is elected president.</p>
      <p>At a town hall, Biden was asked who his vice presidential pick would be if he wins the Democratic nomination.</p>
      <p>"You. Are you available?" Biden joked to the questioner, before giving a serious answer.</p>
      <p>Biden didn't name anyone specifically but said there are a number of people who are qualified.</p>
      <p>"I could start naming people but the press will think that’s who I picked," he said, before obliquely referring to several potential candidates.</p>
      <p>His list included "the former assistant attorney general who got fired," referring to Sally Yates; "the woman who should have been the governor of Georgia," referring to Stacey Abrams; and "the two senators from the state of New Hampshire," referring to U.S. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan.</p>
      <p>Yates garnered national attention in 2017 when President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/30/politics/donald-trump-immigration-order-department-of-justice/index.html">fired her from the U.S. Justice Department</a> for refusing to defend his administration's travel ban. She was acting U.S. attorney general at the time.</p>
      <p>Abrams, a former state lawmaker in Georgia, came close to winning that state's gubernatorial election last year and <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/2019/11/06/election-2020-stacey-abrams-happy-run-vice-presidential-candidate/4175741002/">said in Iowa this month</a> that she would be "happy" to run as a vice presidential nominee.</p>
      <p>Biden also expounded on his own relationship with President Barack Obama, for whom he served as vice president. He said the most important thing is to pick a running mate who aligns with you philosophically and who you can trust with big assignments.</p>
      <p>He said he would express his disagreements with Obama privately, but then was dedicated to carrying out the president's agenda.</p>
      <p>"We were philosophically in agreement and we strategically agreed on everything. We disagreed on tactics sometimes. And a vice president cannot be in a position even in a cabinet meeting where he or she is taking on the president," Biden said.</p>
      <p>"We’ve had arguments, we’ve shouted at each other in private, but we always completely trusted each other," he said.</p>
