      <h1>Andy Walker tips Rangers and Celtic title race to go to the wire as he pinpoints Alfredo Morelos improvement</h1>
      <h2>The former Hoops striker is expecting a very close title race as both sides won over the weekend.</h2>

      <p>Andy Walker expects <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> to duke it out with Celtic for the rest of the season, and believes a change in mentality has improved their title credentials.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> 's side beat Hamilton 3-1 yesterday to move back level with their city rivals at the top of the Premiership, the Hoops having thrashed Livingston the previous day.</p>
      <p>Only goal difference has <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> 's side at the top of the table, and Walker expects things to be close right up to the wire.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> striker said on <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11788/11869911/rangers-mentally-tougher-this-season-says-former-celtic-striker-andy-walker">Sky Sports</a> : (Rangers are) mentally stronger, mentally tougher, the players are absolutely focused on the job at hand.</p>
      <p>"None more so than Alfredo Morelos. I know he was on the bench yesterday but this is a guy that scores regularly when he plays. He scores on the big occasion.</p>
      <p>"You have a month coming up when Rangers and Celtic are going to be playing each other twice - once in the League Cup final and once in the league game just after Christmas.</p>
      <p>"I think Rangers have shown that they are mentally tougher this time round. It's going to be neck and neck between these two sides, I think all the way to the last few weeks of the season."</p>
