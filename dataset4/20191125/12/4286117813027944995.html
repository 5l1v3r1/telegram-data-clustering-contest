      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Sanjay Manjrekar was severely criticized after his on-air spat with Harsha Bhogle during India's crushing victory</li>
        <li>Manjrekar was a reliable middle-order batsman who has earned his stripes as a cricket commentator</li>
        <li>Harsha Bhogle, a seasoned commentator, reckoned India's cricketers needed to be asked about visibility of the pink ball</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sanjay Manjrekar was severely criticized after his on-air spat with Harsha Bhogle during India's crushing victory over Bangladesh in the historic Day-night Test in Kolkata.</p>
      <p>It is not often two Indian commentators spar on air. But it turned ugly enough for Manjrekar, who played 37 Tests and 74 ODIs for India to remind Bhogle, who was the more established cricket expert.</p>
      <p>The Day-night Test captured the imagination of the Indian cricket circuit for many reasons. And the pink ball was obviously the talk of the town. How would it behave under lights? Would there be a prodigious swing? Would the pronounced seam make it easier for the spinners?</p>
      <p>Harsha Bhogle, a seasoned commentator, suggested a post-mortem and reckoned India's cricketers needed to be asked about the visibility of the pink ball under twilight.</p>

Visibility of that ball will be a big factor against the big white sight-screen," Bhogle said.</p>
      <p>Manjrekar was quick to respond.</p>

      <p>"Don't think so. Because when you see the slip catchers, the way they have taken catches, I don't think visibility is an issue at all. The texture of the ball is the issue."<br/>Things took a rather avoidable and nasty turn from there.</p>
      <p>Harsha Bhogle kept on driving home his point but Manjrekar, who started his broadcasting career by the time Bhogle was a star commentator, said there was no need to ask the players everything since some aspects are visible to the naked eye.</p>
      <p>"We just need to ask the players what they think," replied Bhogle, who was the first Indian commentator to be invited by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for an overseas tour in 1992.</p>
      <p>And then these words doomed Manjrekar on social media: "You need to ask; for those who have played cricket, it's evident it (the ball) can be seen well."</p>
      <p>Now, you could argue that Sanjay Manjrekar was rather arrogant in his riposte. There is no pressing need for two commentators to be on the same page on all aspects of the game. But in all fairness, was Manjrekar really wrong?</p>
      <p>Sanjay Manjrekar was no superstar in his playing days but he was a reliable middle-order batsman who has earned his stripes as a cricket commentator.</p>
      <p>Even if you are an established commentator, there is no harm in admitting that a former international cricketer will have better insights on the game happening in the middle.</p>
      <p>Harsha Bhogle wanted to know the opinion of the players on the pink ball's visibility but before bringing in any major changes, do we really need to ask the players? One must not forget that India have been a late reactor to some of the biggest innovations in world cricket over the last few decades, much to the credit of their players.</p>
      <p>India have had their reservations about every successful innovative notion introduced in Cricket: from T20 cricket to Pink ball Tests, and not to forget India's staunch criticism of the DRS.</p>
      <p>It was because of the pressing need to ask players everything that India played their 1st ever Day-night Test after 8 Test-playing nations have had a taste of Pink-ball cricket. India refused to adapt to what is being seen as one of the most important innovations in modern-day cricket for nearly 4 years.</p>
      <p>India had been reluctant to be a part of the Pink ball experiment. Talks of the BCCI hosting New Zealand for a Day-night Test as early as 2016 surfaced but nothing came to fruition until Sourav Ganguly took over as the head of the world's richest cricket body.'</p>
      <p>India were the only team to have not accepted the DRS for so long. When the DRS was first put under trial in 2008, it was India who first came forward to be a part of the experiment. A series later, Indian cricketers became its staunchest critic, much to the surprise of many who expected India to embrace the technology.</p>
      <p>India won the maiden T20 World Cup in 2007 but before the championship, the selectors had their task cut out. India's big three legends had refused to take part in cricket's latest innovation i.e. T20. A young MS Dhoni was tasked with the responsibility of leading an inexperienced Team India because regular captain Rahul Dravid, former skippers Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly had their own reservations regarding T20 cricket.</p>
      <p>Hence, it is quite evident that taking the opinion of Indian players ahead of the imposition of any cricketing innovation has not always resulted in fruitful scenarios. Also, with no disrespect to Harsha Bhogle, Sanjay Manjrekar, being a former international cricketer, may have better first-hand knowledge of scenarios in international cricket.</p>
