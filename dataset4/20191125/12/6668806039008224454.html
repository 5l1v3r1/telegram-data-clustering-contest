      <p>As per a report in a leading daily, the actor will soon be heading to Chandigarh to shoot for the film. He’ll be shooting in Chandigarh from December 2 to December 30 after a month-long schedule. Reportedly set in the ’90s, the film will showcase the high and lows of this struggling cricketer. A source close to the project had this to say, “After prepping for almost two months on turf in suburban Mumbai, Shahid will start shooting from December 2. The month-long schedule stretches right up to December 30. After that, the team will take a break for around four-five days for the second schedule. The Jersey team will be moving in and out of Chandigarh a lot in the coming months. They will shoot at real locations, including a beautiful row house in the heart of the city which will be shown as Shahid’s house.”</p>
