        <b>FIGHT!</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/robbie-williams">Robbie Williams</a> has said he’s approached leading boxing promoter Eddie Hearn to organise a fight with his long-term rival <a href="http://nme.com/artists/liam-gallagher">Liam Gallagher</a>.</p>
      <p>The singer has a rivalry with Gallagher which dates back to the mid-nineties, at the height of <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/oasis">Oasis</a>‘ fame.</p>
      <p>In October, the ‘Angels’ singer said <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/robbie-williams-would-still-love-to-fight-liam-gallagher-2561966">he’d like to duke it out with Gallagher</a> to settle their differences once and for all. And now it seems he’s gone one step further by contacting the Matchroom Sport boss to make his dream a reality.</p>
      <p>“I’ve spoken to Eddie Hearn… Eddie Hearn’s up for it,” Williams revealed during an appearance on ITV’s <i>The Jonathan Ross Show</i>.</p>
      <p>But it still looks an unlikely prospect, with Williams admitting that Gallagher “hasn’t responded, twice. And I’d really like to do it.”</p>
      <p>He added: “I’ve been boxing and I love it and if there’s anybody that I want to box, it’s Liam Gallagher.”</p>

      <p>Eddie Hearn has been approached to organise and promote a potential scrap</p>
      <p>Robbie first laid down the gauntlet at the Brit Awards in 2000 when he collected the Best Video gong for ‘She’s The One’.</p>
      <p>He said at the time:  “Would anybody like to see me fight Liam? Liam: £100,000 of your money, £100,000 of mine… we’ll get in the ring and have a fight. Now are you gonna do it or pussy out, you fucking wimp?”</p>
      <p>Speaking about a potential fight with Liam, Williams also said he’d like to set up a professional one.</p>
      <p>“I’d love it. But I’d want it to be a professional fight. I’ve seen how much [YouTubers] KSI and Logan Paul made from theirs and I think we could trounce that,” he said.</p>
      <p>“But, yeah, I think last time in the noughties Liam wanted to go down to an abandoned railway track or something. I don’t want to do that.</p>
      <p>“It’s got to be fucking whistles and bells if it happens…Yeah, Liam and I would be a wonderful thing.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Robbie released ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/robbie-williams-the-christmas-present-album-review">The Christmas Present</a>‘ last week – his first ever festive album.</p>
