      <h1>When Santa will be calling in at your street in Swadlincote</h1>
      <h2>He will be meeting good boys and girls</h2>

      <p>Santa will be hopping in his sleigh to visit all the good boys and girls from around Swadlincote from next week.</p>
      <p>The big man himself will be joined by his helpful elves from Swadlincote Round Table as volunteers travel around town to spread festive cheer and raise money for good causes.</p>
      <p>This year, Father Christmas will be travelling around estates in Newhall, Midway, Gresley, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/loose-horses-cause-danger-drivers-3574649">Swadlincote</a> and Woodville to find out what youngsters would like to see under their Christmas tree.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Swadlincote Round Table said: "On week nights we try to visit between 6pm and 8pm, except on Fridays, when we continue until 8.30pm.</p>
      <p>"Please understand that whilst we try to visit at times suitable for children it isn't possible for us to be outside everyone's house at a time that is ideal for them.</p>
      <p>"Wherever possible we will try to stick to this schedule, but time and weather may mean that we have to adapt as we go through December.</p>
      <p>"We will be keeping Monday, November 23, free as an optional extra night to cover any areas that time or weather prevent us getting to as planned."</p>
