      <p>Emilia Clarke fought back tears as she recalled how landing a role in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/game-of-thrones/">Game Of Thrones</a> helped her find her place in the world.</p>
      <p>The Last Christmas actress, who played Daenerys Targaryen in the fantasy franchise, was close to balling as she talked about how the feisty character became her ‘saviour’.</p>
      <p>Speaking in the brand new season eight blue-ray DVD, Emilia confessed: ‘What I realised the other day is the show has given me more than just a job, it’s literally given me a family, it’s given me an identity that I didn’t have.</p>
      <p>‘I didn’t think I’d ever be able to play someone like this and so she’s been such a saviour for me in so many ways.’</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘I literally have David [Benioff] and Dan [Daniel Weiss] to thank for hiring me. I have the most hard-working crew. I keep saying it, but I mean it so much. They work harder than anyone.</p>

      <p>‘And the fans have given me a platform and given me hope.</p>
      <p>‘Thank you to all these people I don’t know, it’s amazing.’</p>

      <p>Last week, Emilia claimed that she was told that she would<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/emilia-clarke-told-disappoint-game-thrones-fans-didnt-nude-scenes-11181547/"> ‘disappoint’ the show’s fanbase if she didn’t do nude scenes</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Dax Shepard on his Armchair Expert podcast, the Last Christmas actress said: ‘I’m a lot more savvy [now] with what I’m comfortable with, and what I am okay with doing.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve had fights onset before where I’m like, “No, the sheet stays up”, and they’re like, “You don’t wanna disappoint your Game of Thrones fans”. And I’m like, “F*** you”.’</p>
      <p>The Khaleesi star added: ‘I took the job and then they sent me the scripts and I was reading them, and I was, like, “Oh, there’s the catch!” But I’d come fresh from drama school, and I approached [it] as a job – if it’s in the script then it’s clearly needed, this is what this is and I’m gonna make sense of it…</p>
      <p>‘Everything’s gonna be cool.’</p>
