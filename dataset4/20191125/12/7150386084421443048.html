      <p>Former limited-overs captain of <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/australia">Australia</a> <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/george-bailey">George Bailey</a> is all set to become the new national selector along side coach <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/justin-langer">Justin Langer</a> and chairman Trevor Hohns.</p>
      <p>The 37-year-old Bailey, who still plays for Big Bash League (BBL) side Hobart Hurricanes and in the Sheffield Shield for Tasmania, will not be the first active cricketer to be a national selector.</p>
      <p>In the past Don Bradman and Michael Clarke have enjoyed the post while still being the captain of the national team.</p>
      <p>Bailey, who has represented Australia in five Tests, 90 ODIs and 30 T20s, is yet to call it quits from the game.</p>
      <p>Asked about the necessity of a new selector, Cricket Australia head of national teams Ben Oliver said he was “really pleased with the people who put their hat in the ring for that role”.</p>
      <p>“There will be some people who are really disappointed no doubt but they should all take great encouragement and they all have a lot to offer,” he said.</p>
      <p>Although it is believed that CA is showing keen interest in Bailey because of his vast knowledge of the white-ball formats as a player, especially with next year’s Twenty20 World Cup at home round the corner, Oliver said the new selector would also be involved in selecting squads for Test matches.</p>
      <p>“The panel, and all three, will be responsible for all Australian men’s teams,” Oliver said.</p>
      <p>“What we’ve tried to achieve in this recruitment process is adding in some complementary skills to support Trevor and Justin and one of those is a consideration around short-format cricket.”</p>
