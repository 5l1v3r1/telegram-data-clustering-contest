      <p>Stagecoach has announced the head of its south West of England bus operations has left the company - the news comes seven weeks after a double decker bus crash.</p>
      <p>Bob Dennison, who been with the company for 20 years, 'stepped down' as its South West managing director last week.</p>
      <p>Mark Threapleton, Stagecoach chief operating officer, said: “I would like to thank Bob for the contribution he has made over many years at a number of companies across Stagecoach, including in the south west. We wish him well for the future.”</p>
      <p>Mr Dennison has stated the reason for his departure is seek out 'new challenges'.</p>
      <p>He said: “I've greatly enjoyed working with the team at Stagecoach South West, and with colleagues across the wider business, over the past two decades and I will look back fondly on the many achievements that I have been part of.</p>
      <p>"Stagecoach has been a huge part of my life, but the time has come for a different focus and I'm looking forward to new challenges ahead. I would like to thank all the people I've worked with at Stagecoach over the years for their commitment, assistance and support."</p>
      <p>Bob began his bus industry career in 1994 as an apprentice mechanic in New Zealand before starting work with Stagecoach in Hull.</p>
      <p>In 2000, Bob achieved a place on Stagecoach’s staff development programme, and subsequently moved to Cambridge as Engineering Supervisor.</p>
      <p>He then had a spell as engineering manager at Peterborough depot before being appointed engineering manager at Cambridge depot. Bob was appointed engineering director at Stagecoach east in 2008.</p>
      <p>For the past four years, Bob has managed Stagecoach’s south west of England business, which runs local bus services across Exeter, East Devon, Torbay, south Devon, north Devon, Somerset and into Cornwall and Dorset.</p>
      <p>While a formal recruitment process takes place to recruit a new south west managing director, Mike Watson, who was previously Stagecoach regional director for England and Wales and who has most recently been working with the business development team, has been appointed interim managing director, Stagecoach south west.</p>
      <p>More than 50 passengers and the driver of a bus travelling along the A385 between Totnes and Paignton were injured on Saturday, October 5, when it overturned in a field.</p>
      <p>The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) has confirmed it is working alongside the police to carry out an investigation into the incident.</p>
      <p>A member of staff recently told Devon Live the chief operations officer for Stagecoach nationally, Mark Threapleton, attended a meeting with a senior member of staff in Exeter on October 31.</p>
      <p>Talking last month Stagecoach said it would not comment specifically on any of its employees, but confirmed the two senior member of staff named to Devon Live are still employed by Stagecoach. </p>
