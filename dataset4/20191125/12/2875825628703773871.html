      <h2>Gardai say they are at the 'scene of an incident'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:02:14+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:02</time> by <a rel="author">Brynmor PattisonDeputy Online Editor, John Patrick Kierans</a></address>
      <p>A body was discovered at a laneway near a school in <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/dublin">Dublin</a> this morning.</p>
      <p>Gardai say they are at the "scene of an incident" at Balbutcher Lane in <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ballymun">Ballymun</a>.</p>
      <p>The Irish Mirror understands that a body was discovered there this morning.</p>
      <p>The discovery was made just yards from a local school.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/an-garda-siochana">garda</a> spokesman said: "Gardai are currently at the scene of an incident at Balbutcher Lane area of Ballymun.</p>
      <p>"A scene is currently in place. Further updates will issue."</p>

      <p>Just last Monday, there was a 'shooting' scare in the area.</p>
      <p>Gardai responded to reports of a loud bang from a place known locally as 'The Hill' near St Joseph's School at around 3pm on Monday, November 18.</p>
      <p>It was feared that a gun had gone off - however no evidence was found to suggest there was a shooting.</p>
      <p>Locals <a href="https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/quick-thinking-staff-lockdown-school-17277609">told Dublin Live</a> last week how the area has been known as an anti-social blackspot, describing it as a "no-go area".</p>
      <p>One said: "There's always trouble there, residents are sick. There's open drug dealing and fighting and we're scared someone will be hurt."</p>
