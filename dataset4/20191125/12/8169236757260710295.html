        <b>Former Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino is reportedly in no hurry to jump back into any job in football that comes along.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Argentine was sacked by Spurs last week and it is little surprise to now see him being linked with a number of big names after doing such a fine job for most of his time in north London.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/mauricio-pochettino-news-manchester-united-bayern-munich-real-madrid-arsenal-a9216461.html">Independent</a> give a good analysis of potential destinations for Pochettino as they stress that the 47-year-old will not be swayed by money or the status of a big club as he looks to take time out and reflect after his exit from Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Manchester United are one name mentioned, and it makes sense that they might soon be looking for a change in the dugout after a poor start to the season from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>That said, the Independent claim the Red Devils are determined to back the Norwegian tactician’s vision for the club as things stand.</p>

      <p>Most fans would surely love to see Man Utd swoop for the far more proven Pochettino as soon as possible, with Solskjaer not looking up to such a big job and likely only landing the role due to his legendary playing career at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Arsenal, meanwhile, are also mentioned by the Independent as a name that keeps coming up, though the report suggests it would be out of keeping with Pochettino’s character to manage Tottenham’s rivals.</p>
      <p>While Gooners would surely take him, the Independent references old quotes from Pochettino about not wanting to manage Barcelona due to having previously coached their rivals Espanyol.</p>
      <p>Still, an offer may well come in soon as Unai Emery looks under increasing pressure at the Emirates Stadium, as reported by the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/unai-emery-edging-closer-arsenal-20949405?d">Daily Mirror</a> and others.</p>
