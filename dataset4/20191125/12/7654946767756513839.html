      <h1>Julian Assange ‘could die in prison’ without urgent medical care: doctors</h1>

      <p>WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is so sick, he could die in prison if he does not get urgent medical care, according to an open letter sent Monday to British authorities.</p>
      <p>More than 60 doctors wrote to UK Home Secretary Priti Patel to express “serious concerns” about Assange’s fitness to stand trial as he <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/21/julian-assanges-lawyer-says-us-is-plotting-to-kidnap-and-harm-wikileaks-founder/">fights extradition to the US</a> on espionage charges.</p>
      <p>“It is our opinion that Mr. Assange requires urgent expert medical assessment of both his physical and psychological state of health,” wrote the doctors, from the UK, Australia, Europe and Sri Lanka.</p>
      <p>“Were such urgent assessment and treatment not to take place, we have real concerns, on the evidence currently available, that Mr. Assange could die in prison.</p>
      <p>“The medical situation is thereby urgent. There is no time to lose,” they wrote.</p>
      <p>The letter says that Assange, 48, suffers from psychological problems including “major depression,” as well as dental issues and a serious shoulder ailment. He also shows the “symptoms of a torture victim,” the letter claims.</p>

      <p>Assange is currently in Belmarsh prison on the outskirts of London <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/01/julian-assange-gets-50-weeks-in-prison-for-jumping-uk-bail/">serving a 50-week sentence for jumping bail</a> as he also awaits his next extradition hearing in February.</p>
      <p>US authorities have accused Assange of scheming with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to hack a password for a classified government computer.</p>
      <p>He could face up to 175 years in prison under the Espionage Act but claims he is a journalist entitled to First Amendment protection.</p>
