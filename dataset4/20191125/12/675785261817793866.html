      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:54:33+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:54</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Sergio Aguero has been ruled out of the Manchester derby, but his injury is better than first feared, Pep Guardiola has confirmed.</p>
      <p>Manchester City boss Guardiola feared the worst when his talisman hobbled off in the 77th minute of Manchester City's 2-1 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>But the tendon injury is better than first feared, and should only keep Aguero out for a few games rather than a couple of months.</p>
      <p>"A few games, I don't know exactly," said Guardiola. "He has a tendon problem in front - will be a few games out."</p>
      <p>Both David Silva and Rodri were also forced off against Chelsea, but Guardiola was less concerned for the Spainards.</p>

      <p>Providing an update on their conditions on Monday, he added: "We have no other [new] injuries. David Silva [and Rodri] had cramp but he's okay."</p>
      <p>The Citizens went behind against Chelsea at the Etihad after N'Golo Kante slotted past Ederson after getting the better of Benjamin Mendy.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> hit back through Kevin de Bruyne who leveled the scores.</p>

      <p>Riyad Mahrez had the final say for the Citizens when he produced a moment of magic to beat two Chelsea defenders and fire City ahead.</p>
      <p>Raheem Sterling had the goal in the back of the net late on for City, but it was ruled out by VAR.</p>
