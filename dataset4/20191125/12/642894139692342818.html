      <p>“Getting to connect with my fans on tour is a truly humbling experience,” says Brooks. “You learn so much about a day in the life of these folks and you see that we really aren’t all that different. Music, art, games – they bring people together for a great shared experience. Being able to gift <i>Words With Friends </i>players like me with a cool tile style is such a great thing – it’s a real source of joy for me.”</p>
      <p>“Meeting Garth Brooks is every fan’s biggest dream; to get to actually work with him on <i>Words With Friends</i>, a game that has united millions across the world, has been extraordinary,” said Bernard Kim, President of Publishing at Zynga. “<i>Words With Friends</i> players love Garth, and our platform has given them the chance to connect with one of country music’s biggest idols. Celebrating the season with the man himself is a testament to the game’s ability to build community.”</p>
      <p>Garth Brooks just won Entertainer of the Year at the CMA Awards for the seventh time, a first for any artist. He is also the first artist in history to receive seven Diamond awards for the now seven albums certified by the RIAA at over 10 million album sales each and remains the #1-selling solo artist in U.S. history certified by the RIAA with over 148 million album sales. He has received every accolade the recording industry can bestow on an artist. Garth has been inducted into the International Songwriters Hall of Fame in New York, the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, Country Music Hall of Fame and most recently, the Musicians Hall of Fame. Garth just finished the three and a half year long, Garth Brooks World Tour with Trisha Yearwood. Beginning with 11 sold out shows at the Allstate Arena in Chicago, the tour smashed records previously held by such acts as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and even Garth Brooks. The tour sold over 6.3 million tickets, making it the biggest North American tour in history and the biggest American tour in the world.</p>
