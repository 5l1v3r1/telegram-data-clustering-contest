      <h2>Former Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho had plenty of ups and downs during his time at Old Trafford - and it seems one memorable moment stayed with him throughout his tenure</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:33:52+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:33</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Gibbs</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> is well known for rarely showing emotion on the touchline - especially when his team nets an important goal.</p>
      <p>But there are a few exceptions - with one of the most bizarre coming against Young Boys back in 2018.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> had struggled to find a way past a resilient Young Boys defence but Marouane Fellaini popped up with a late injury-time winner to secure a 1-0 victory.</p>
      <p>Mourinho certainly didn’t hide his emotions as the ball hit the back of the net, letting off steam as he picked up a crate of water bottles, promptly slamming it to the ground.</p>
      <p>And according to <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1398545/2019/11/25/ornstein-on-monday-raiola-complicates-united-pursuit-of-haaland-adidas-gives-mourinho-special-treatment-rogue-firms-exploit-premier-league-clubs-bruce-shelves-new-book/">The Athletic</a> , that crate of drinks then found its way into his office at Carrington.</p>

      <p>Mourinho was a huge fan of Fellaini with the Belgian rescuing him on numerous occasions - perhaps the drinks crate was a nice reminder of how they’d stuck by each other when the majority of the Old Trafford faithful were calling for their heads at one time or another during their spells.</p>
      <p>The Special One is unlikely to have taken his piece of memorabilia to London though with Mourinho now settling into his new role as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> boss after succeeding Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese led his team to a 3-2 win over rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on Saturday with his task to now ensure Spurs finish in the top four this season.</p>

      <p>Mourinho has won 20 major trophies and will now aim to end Tottenham’s wait for silverware with their last coming in the League Cup back in 2008.</p>
      <p>Captain Harry Kane is convinced the 56-year-old is the right man to do just that.</p>
      <p>"The gaffer's won at every club he's gone to - there's no hiding away from that," said Kane.</p>
      <p>"I've made it clear that I'm at the stage of my career where I want to win trophies. I've made it clear I want to win them here and it's a big year for us.</p>
      <p>"Realistically we look at the Champions League and the FA Cup this season to try to do that, so we'll see how that goes and then from my point of view I'll keep doing what I'm doing, keep fighting for this club on the pitch.</p>
      <p>"We all want to win. We wanted to win when Mauricio was here; we want to win the same now the gaffer's here.</p>
      <p>"But of course when someone's got a reputation like he has, it gives you confidence, it gives you that belief in the team.</p>
      <p>"It's almost a fresh slate for everyone now to show the manager what they can do and hopefully the players can thrive on that."</p>
