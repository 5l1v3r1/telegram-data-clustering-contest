      <p>I'm a Celebrity's Jacqueline Jossa was accused of "putting it on" by a former campmate on This Morning today.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebrity-winner-toff-tears-17304573">Former winner Toff</a> appeared on the sofa with Stanley Johnson to speak about the developments in this year's series.</p>
      <p>Chatting to Holly and Phil the group spoke about <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/ian-wright-takes-swipe-jacqueline-17304142">how much Jacqueline</a> appeared to struggle when she was picked to do trials.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline has been picked to do several trials by the public in recent days and cried before each of them, saying she didn't think she could do them.</p>

      <p>But despite her hysterics Jacqueline has actually done well in most of the tasks she's undertaken.</p>
      <p>And Stanley Johnson slammed her antics and said: "Don't you just think she's putting it on a bit."</p>
      <p>Toff and Holly disagreed and said: "I think she's just stronger than she thinks."</p>

      <p>But some viewers at home agreed with Stanley, taking to social media.</p>
      <p>mellers1313 said: "I tink Jacqueline does put it on Stanely. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ImACeleb">#ImACeleb</a> "</p>
      <p>Dave said: "Jacqueline's acting... she cries and begs not to do the trials because she wants people to feel sorry for her and not vote for her. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thismorning">#thismorning</a> "</p>
      <p>And JTP said: "People keep voting for Jacqueline because of how she acts, at first is was because she wouldn't stop whining, then, cockily going 'thanks public' is gonna get her more votes...people don't like cocky people <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ThisMorning">#ThisMorning</a><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Imaceleb">#Imaceleb</a> "</p>
      <p>Jacqueline was previously criticised for not putting her name in the hat to go to jungle jail.</p>
      <p>Her actions caused the first camp argument, with <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/andrew-maxwell-sparks-health-concern-17304165">Andrew particularly annoyed</a> she counted herself out of the ordeal.</p>
