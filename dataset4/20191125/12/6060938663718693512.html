      <p>NEW DELHI: India's aviation regulator on Monday directed IndiGo to ground an Airbus A320/21 currently in its fleet with unmodified Pratt &amp; Whitney (PW) engines each time it inducts a new A320/21 with modified PW engines under both its wings.</p>
      <p>The earlier Neo will be grounded till it gets modified engines. And the new one will fly it's routes till then so that there is no schedule disruption in the ongoing winter travel season.</p>
      <p>Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) chief Arun Kumar has also ordered that IndiGo should lease only A320/21 Neos that have modified PW engines under both their wings.</p>
      <p>IndiGo is the world’s largest customer of Airbus A320 Neo family of aircraft with 635 of these yet to be delivered at the rate of one plane a week for the next 12-13 years. The order could hit IndiGo’s growth plans in the short to medium term. An IndiGo spokesperson said: “The current schedule remains intact. IndiGo is working with PW and Airbus to adjust inflow of modified engines to meet DGCA guidelines.”</p>
      <p>The unprecedented order came after DGCA on Monday reviewed IndiGo’s action plan to meet the earlier regulatory deadline for having only modified engines on all its Neos by January 31, 2020. IndiGo will need over 110 PW engines for that purpose and the regulator felt that at current pace of replacement the deadline is unlikely to be met for all.</p>
      <p>Last week, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a notice saying PW was going to replace the material of an affected part of its engines for Neos which is less susceptible to impact damage. “These conditions, if not addressed, could result in uncontained release of the LPT (low pressure turbine) third stage blades, failure of one or more engines, loss of thrust control, and loss of airplane,” the DGCA said about the FAA note.</p>
      <p>Keeping the FAA warning in mind and with an impression that Airbus and PW are not helping IndiGo get the required number of replacement engines in time for the January 31 deadline, the DGCA issued Monday’s orders.</p>
      <p>“If left unaddressed, we may find ourselves in a situation in which we remain saddled with large number of aircraft with unmodified engines and operating on a schedule approved by us and we are left with the only option to ground them on or after January 31, 2020. If DGCA exercise this option, large scale disruptions with its attendant consequences shall follow,” the DGCA order said.</p>
      <p>“At this stage, DGCA is of the view that it is a sub optional solution and therefore, be avoided to the extent possible. Though DGCA does not wish to interfere with the import of aircraft however, it is the considered view of DGCA that from now onwards, every aircraft that is added to the existing fleet, should lead to one of those with unmodified engines to be grounded,” the order added.</p>
      <p>This process is to be followed till all engine replacement is complete. “DGCA perceives that this substitution of an aircraft with unmodified engines with modified one, will not cause any disruption and shall improve the safety of aircraft operations and maintain the regularity of operations,” it added.</p>
