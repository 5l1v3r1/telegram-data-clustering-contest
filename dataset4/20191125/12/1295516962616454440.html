      <p>Fans of the Skywalker Saga almost got a chance to own the script for <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-episode-ix/"><i>The Rise of Skywalker</i></a> after it was stolen from a cast member and wound up on eBay.</p>
      <p>Director/co-writer J.J. Abrams appeared on <i><a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/star-wars-director-jj-abrams-reveals-rise-skywalker-67289571">Good Morning America</a> o</i>n Monday and recalled the ordeal, saying, "One of our actors, I won’t say which one — I want to, but I won’t — left it under their bed and it was found by someone who was cleaning their place. It was then given to someone else who went to sell it on eBay."</p>

      <p><a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-disney-hiatus-after-rise-skywalker/amp/">Disney and Lucasfilm</a> are notorious for the lengths they go to avoid spoilers, and it was a Disney employee who found the script early enough to prevent anyone from scooping it up. The script probably would have gone for a tidy sum, even though, as Abrams reports, the film has been doing reshoots and only finished this Sunday.</p>

      <p>Abrams also went on to mention how important the Skywalker Saga is to fans and to him, and what the late Carrie Fisher means to the franchise. Even though she died in 2016, before <i>Episode IX</i> began production, Abrams is repurposing older footage so she can be a part of the film.</p>
      <p>Directed and co-written by J.J. Abrams, <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> stars Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong’o, Domhnall Gleeson, Kelly Marie Tran, Joonas Suotamo, Billie Lourd, Keri Russell, Anthony Daniels, Mark Hamill, Billy Dee Williams, and Carrie Fisher, with Naomi Ackie and Richard E. Grant. The film arrives on Dec. 20.</p>
