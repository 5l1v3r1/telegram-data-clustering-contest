      <p>The Huawei Sound X is a high-end speaker produced in collaboration with Devialet. Devialet is a French tech firm dedicated to creating high-end amplifiers, speakers and whatnot. This collaboration brought to us a speaker which design is inspired by the Vienna Golden Hall.</p>
      <p>The Sound X adopts a fully symmetric design with a diameter of 165mm, height of 203mm for 3.5kg. The speaker uses a NCVM (non-conductive vacuum plating) process, which means it has a metal-like texture while not affecting wireless signal transmissions. It’s also quite scratch resistant, water resistant and it could be cleaned with alcohol.</p>

      <p>Specs wise, Huawei’s Sound X sports a 60W dual-subwoofer which utilizes a patented speaker-matching signal processing technology. This combined with a unique symmetrical subwoofer design and a calibration by Devialat’s Paris laboratory, should bring a shockingly good audio.</p>
      <p>According to Huawei, this “Push-Push” symmetrical design also allows the back-wave interference generated by the two speakers to cancel each other; resulting in a noise-free and energy-rich sound experience. The Sound X is then the first Hi-Res-certified smart speaker with sound that extends to up to 40KHz for richer trebles.</p>

      <p>The Sound X also supports a feature called “touch of sound”. This means sound will start playing through the speaker once you tap on it with the smartphone. Additionally, when an incoming call is detected, the speaker will pause itself.</p>
      <p>Finally, Huawei’s speaker comes with Bluetooth 5.0 and supports 2.4/5Ghz WiFi.</p>

      <p>The Huawei Sound X will cost 1999 Yuan for a single unit ($280). While for a stereo experience price almost doubles at 3888 Yuan ($550).</p>
