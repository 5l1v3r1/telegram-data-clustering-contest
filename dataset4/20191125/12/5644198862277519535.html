      </h3>
      <p>Mr Anwar, the Port Dickson Member of Parliament, was replying to a question on whether he would join the Cabinet when Dr Mahathir decides to reshuffle it.</p>
      <p>In his speech, Mr Anwar reminded leaders and members of PKR to stop raising the issue of power transition for the post of prime minister.</p>
      <p>“Give space to Dr Mahathir so that the process of transition (of power) can be carried out in a proper manner," he said. </p>
      <p>"If the situation is calm and peaceful, it will be easier for (Dr Mahathir) to discharge his duty ... I’m not upset and not worried although there are quarters trying to undermine this understanding (on power transfer)."</p>
      <p>Mr Anwar said only the PH Presidential Council could decide on the person to be appointed the eighth prime minister and the date for the power transition.</p>
