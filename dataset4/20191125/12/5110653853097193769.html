      <h1>College football bowl projections Week 14: Utah, Oklahoma, Alabama in Playoff hunt</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:41:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:41</time> by <a rel="author">Bill Bender</a></address>
      <p>Sporting News' Week 14 bowl projections are here in time for the fourth set of College Football Playoff rankings, which will be unveiled on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Playoff picture saw some major changes after Oregonâ€™s loss to Arizona State. That opens up a wide-open debate for the No. 4 final spot.</p>

      </p>
      <p>For now, SN has Oklahoma in the final spot. Utah and Alabama will have a strong case, but the Sooners might get the edge with a Big 12 championship, buoyed by potential quality wins against Oklahoma State and Baylor the next two weeks. All this assumes Georgia loses in the SEC championship game to LSU.</p>
      <p>That would put LSU and Oklahoma in the Chick-Fil-A Peach Bowl and Clemson and Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl.</p>
