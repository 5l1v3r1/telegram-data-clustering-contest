        <b>- It is not called Hollywierd for nothing, but this latest revelation from Hollywood is really shocking</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>- The screenwriter of the newly-released movie Harriet revealed that a studio executive once suggested that Julia Roberts play the icon in the film</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>- Tubman was African-American, which is what makes the suggestion ludicrous</b>
      </p>
      <p>Harriet Tubman was a political activist who is famous for helping dozens of people escape slavery. The movie Harriet<i> </i>was released on Friday, November 1, and the leading lady is British actress Cynthia Erivo.</p>

      <p>However, strangely, a black woman in the lead might not have been the case had the movie been made 25 years ago.</p>
      <p>The movie's screenwriter, Gregory Allen Howard, revealed that a studio president suggested Julia Roberts play the human rights hero when the idea for the film was tabled over two decades ago.</p>
      <p>Howard told the LA Times: <i>"Fortunately, there was a single black person in that studio meeting 25 years ago who told him that Harriet Tubman was a black woman."</i></p>

      </p>
      <p>According to Howard, the studio president then replied: <i>"That was so long ago. No one will know that."</i></p>
      <p>First of all, let's give Howard a hand for holding onto his dream until it materialised a whole 25 years later.</p>
      <p>Secondly, can you imagine Julia Roberts playing Harriet Tubman, a black woman? Well, many people on social media certainly cannot.</p>

      <p>One user pointed out that they were not surprised, and identified multiple times that Hollywood executives had white actors portray characters that were actually people of colour.</p>

      <p>In 2016 it was announced that Tubman would be on the $20 currency note in the States, but the Trump administration has delayed that process until 2028.</p>
