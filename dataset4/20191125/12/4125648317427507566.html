In addition to taking part in the southeastern Idlib offensive, Liwaa Al-Quds also has troops in the Badiya Al-Sham region of Homs and Deir Ezzor; they are currently taking part in the combing operations against the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL/IS/Daesh) there. As arguably one of the powerful Palestinian paramilitary forces in Syria, Liwaa Al-Quds has proven themselves as a formidable force inside the country, especially against terrorist groups like Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham and Daesh."/>
