      <h1>KUWK: Kendall Jenner Hints She Might Want To ‘Start A Family’ While Playing With Kimye’s Sons – Check Out The Cute Pics!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:26:52+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:26</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Mitchell</a></address>
      <p>The supermodel is the only one that is yet to become a parent out of the whole Kardashian-Jenner clan. That being said, is Kendall Jenner ready to take on that role as well?</p>
      <p>Whether she is getting any closer to wanting kids of her own or not, it’s safe to say that Kendall is an amazing aunt to her 10 nephews and nieces!</p>
      <p>But since she knows that some fans would love to see her start a family early on like her younger sister, Kylie, she played around with the idea in a new post!</p>
      <p>Kendall took to her platform to share a couple of cute pics that showed her doing her duty as the cool aunt and playing with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s sons, Saint and Psalm.</p>
      <p>The photos are definitely super adorable but the caption managed to gather almost the same amount of attention!</p>
      <p>After all, she suggested she may have baby fever, writing: ‘everyone in favor of Fai and i starting a family say ‘I’ ✋🏼.’</p>
      <p>A couple of snaps showed the model goofing around with the older child, even holding Saint upside down on her knees while also holding little Psalm in her arms. Aww….</p>

      <p>As for the one she mentioned in the cation, it was her BFF Fai Khadra, who was also hanging out with her and the kids.</p>
      <p>The two close friends were linked romantically before and even went to Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin’s wedding together as each other’s dates.</p>
      <p>However, Kendall made it very clear that ‘We don’t date, he’s just my date,’ when she posted a pic from the singer and model pair’s ceremony.</p>
      <p>But, as it seems, fans are not the only ones shipping the two since her famous friends were quick to show enthusiasm over the idea of Kendall and Fai starting a family together.</p>
      <p>Hailey Baldwin, in particular, was super excited, writing sever comments about it in a row, reading: ‘I SAY YES.’ / ‘MEEEEE.’ / ‘I DOOO.’ / ‘IIIII.’</p>
