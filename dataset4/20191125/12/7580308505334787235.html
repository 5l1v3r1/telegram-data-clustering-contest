      <p>Nigeria’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Monday said Lagos was the country’s top investment destination for the third quarter of 2019.</p>
      <p>“By Destination of Investment, Lagos state emerged as the top destination of capital investment in Nigeria in Q3 2019 with $4,976.40 billion,” NBS said in its Q3 capital importation report.</p>
      <p>The $4,976.40 billion, NBS said, accounted for 92.71% of the total capital inflow in Q3 2019.</p>
      <p>Asides Lagos, Nigeria’s capital city Abuja, Edo, Kaduna, Kano, Ogun and Oyo state also featured in the report.</p>

      <p>The NBS said <a href="https://guardian.ng/news/nigerias-capital-importation-drops-in-q3-nbs/">Nigeria’s total investment inflows dropped by $460m</a> from $5.82bn in the second quarter of this year to $5.36bn in the third quarter of the year.</p>
      <p>This is the lowest amount of capital importation received in the year.</p>
      <p>“The largest amount of capital importation by type was received through portfolio investment, which accounted for 55.88% ($2,999.50m) of total capital importation, followed by Other Investment, which accounted for 40.39% ($2.167.98m) of total capital, and then Foreign Direct Investment FDI, which accounted for 3.73% ($200.08m) of total capital imported in Q3 2019,” NBS said in the report.</p>
