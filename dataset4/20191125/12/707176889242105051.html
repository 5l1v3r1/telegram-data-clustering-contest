      <h2>Success for Luis Lacalle Pou would be blow for leftist Broad Front coalition</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:00:49+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Benedict Mander</a></address>
      <p>Uruguay’s conservative opposition leader Luis Lacalle Pou is on track for victory in Sunday’s presidential elections with a razor-thin margin, in what would be another blow for a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/04a32b00-03bb-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd">left-leaning bloc</a> in South America.</p>
      <p>But the electoral court said it would confirm the result when a final count was completed later this week. The 46-year-old lawyer and son of a former president was in the lead by slightly less than 30,000 votes in a run-off poll, leaving Daniel Martínez, the 62-year-old former mayor of the capital Montevideo representing the ruling Broad Front coalition, in second place after 100 per cent of the vote was counted.</p>
      <p>“Formally, we will know the result in a few days. Unfortunately, the government’s candidate has not recognised a result that from our point of view is irreversible,” said Mr Lacalle Pou as he addressed supporters after midnight on Sunday, urging them to go home in peace. The results are likely to be confirmed on Thursday or Friday.</p>
      <p>Because the margin of victory is so small, the electoral authority said it needed to scrutinise 35,229 votes cast by people unable to vote in their designated electoral ward before declaring a definitive winner. These votes have yet to be counted.</p>
      <p>José Arocena, head of Uruguay’s electoral court, said it could not yet declare a winner because “there was never such a tight ballot”.</p>
      <p>A win for Mr Lacalle Pou would put an end to 15 years in power for the Broad Front, the last to fall of the leftist governments that swept to power during the commodities-fuelled boom at the turn of the century. Bolivia’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8549edc6-0a72-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">Evo Morales</a> fled to Mexico amid violent protests earlier this month.</p>

      <p>As well as presiding over one of the longest cycles of economic growth in Uruguay’s history that saw both poverty and inequality fall, the Broad Front has also implemented pioneering social reforms that have won widespread international acclaim, including the legalisation of abortion, same-sex marriage and cannabis.</p>
      <p>“The Broad Front’s legacy is very positive. They [would] leave behind a country that is richer and fairer, and made huge progress in terms of [social] rights,” said Adolfo Garcé, a political scientist in Montevideo.</p>
      <p>“But today there are <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/37702dac-904e-11e9-b7ea-60e35ef678d2">many problems</a>, and they are tired and lacking ideas,” added Mr Garcé, identifying a rise in violent crime, a struggling economy and a fall in education standards as the principal challenges facing Uruguay, one of Latin America’s most stable countries.</p>
      <p>Support for the government of Tabaré Vázquez, who was re-elected to a second term as president for the Broad Front in 2014, waned after a doubling in homicide rates in recent years to about 12 per 100,000 people in 2018. In addition, the Broad Front’s popularity has suffered from a stalling economy, with average annual economic growth of just 1.6 per cent over the past five years dropping from 5 per cent during its first decade in power from 2005 to 2015.</p>
      <p>The market-friendly Mr Lacalle Pou, who leads the conservative National party, has pledged to boost competitiveness and cut a fiscal deficit of about 5 per cent of gross domestic product without raising the tax burden, which is already one of the highest in the region. He claims that he can reduce state spending by as much as $900m without cutting public sector jobs.</p>
      <p>The coalition led by Mr Lacalle Pou, whose father Luis Alberto Lacalle was president from 1990 to 1995, includes Uruguay’s two main parties, the Colorado party and the National party, which alternated in power for most of Uruguay’s history since independence in 1828.</p>
      <p>In an effort to defeat the Broad Front, they this year joined forces with others including a far-right party founded this year and led by the former head of the army, Guido Manini Ríos. The retired general performed unexpectedly well in a primary election between all opposition parties, almost defeating the Colorado party’s candidate, Ernesto Talvi.</p>
      <p>Mr Lacalle Pou’s loose coalition is set to have a majority in congress, controlling 56 out of 99 seats in the lower house and 17 out of 31 seats in the senate. But analysts question its stability, and point out that the Broad Front remains the largest single force, with 42 deputies and 13 senators.</p>
