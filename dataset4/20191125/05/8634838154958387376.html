        <b>A seemingly fed-up Jubilee <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46778-mt-kenya-will-accept-bbi-under-1-condition-ruto-ally">member of the National Assembly took matters into his own hands </a>and stormed a Chinese construction site confronted some Chinese contractors at a work station in his county.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to a video aired by <i>KTN News</i> on Sunday, November 24, Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua confronted the contractors for by-passing locals to employ foreigners in the project.</p>
      <p>The visibly angry lawmaker further gave ultimatums to the contractors demanding that they should rectify the situation as soon as possible and ensure at least Ksh500 million of the Ksh1.5 billion project circulates within the county.</p>

      <p>"You cannot come here with people from other places and there are people here who are not working and yet where you operate depends on the taxpayers' money.</p>
      <p>"Ksh500 million must be left here with our people, you understand? We want the money to circulate for the locals to feel the benefit of this project," stated Gachagua.</p>
      <p>The lawmaker was reacting after receiving complaints from locals that the firm had not employed any of their people since starting the construction works.</p>
      <p>The broadcaster further indicated that the contractor had imported workers from a previous work station in Kirinyaga County to Mathira, Nyeri County.</p>
      <p>"What we cannot accept is that you go and bring people from all over the country while our people are not working</p>
      <p>"What is happening is that when they came to build this road, they had come from other projects, they came with some supervisors from other projects," he continued.</p>
      <p>After the meeting, <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/45858-cs-bows-pressure-after-backlash-over-uhurus-project">the Chinese contractors agreed to make the changes</a>. On Sunday, November 24, an interview for truck drivers was carried out at the site.</p>
