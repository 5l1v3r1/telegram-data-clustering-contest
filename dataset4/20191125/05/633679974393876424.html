      <p>Twelve people accused of publishing hate speech on Facebook are expected to appear in the South Gauteng High Court (sitting as the Equality Court) on Monday.</p>
      <p>The legal steps were taken by "The Chinese Association" (TCA) following a series of comments made by individuals which were posted on the Facebook pages of Carte Blanche and the Karoo Donkey Sanctuary in early 2017.</p>
      <p>The speech being challenged includes statements that Chinese people are "not human, are "vile and barbaric", and that South Africa should "get rid" of the Chinese. Further statements are that they should be "wipe[d] out" and that "we should start killing their children".</p>
      <p>Deputy Chairperson for the TCA Francis Lai Hong says the case is about shining a spotlight on how Chinese people in South Africa face frequent hate speech, particularly on social media.</p>
      <p>He says there were about 200 comments on the two Facebook pages but they decided to take the 12 most offensive ones to court and reported the others to the South African Human Rights Commission.</p>
      <p>The matter was briefly heard in March where a trial date for November was set.</p>
