      <h1>Super funds with related-party insurers in firing line</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:40:34+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:40</time> by <a rel="author">John Collett</a></address>
      <p>The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority <a href="https://www.apra.gov.au/news-and-publications/apra-proposes-changes-to-prudential-standard-governing-insurance">has sent a letter to the trustees of super funds</a> spelling out new reporting requirements that will help ensure life insurance made available to their members is in their members' best interests.</p>
      <p>From January 1, 2021, super funds will have to obtain independent certification that insurance arrangements are in the "best interests" of members.</p>

      <p>The certification is only required for funds who have insurance arrangements with a related-party insurers or gives a "priority or privilege" to a particular insurer.</p>
      <p>It was one of the recommendations of the Hayne royal commission into misconduct in the financial services industry and is aimed at helping to deal with any conflicts of interests between parent organisation that own the super fund and insurer and the members of the super fund.</p>
      <p>Such a conflict could mean, for example, that members pay more for cover than if their super fund was an unrelated insurer.</p>
      <p>Mark Kachor, managing director of super industry researcher DEXX&amp;R, said the affected super funds include Westpac and may include NAB, which has a minority shareholding in MLC Insurance.</p>
      <p>It could also affect AMP, though the company has plans to sell its life insurance division but could retain some ownership.</p>
      <p>Colonial First State, which is owned by the Commonwealth Bank, did use CommInsure for the members of its super funds, but CommInsure is now under the "effective control" of AIA, an unrelated insurer, Mr Kachor said.</p>
      <p>Nor-for-profit super funds, such as industry funds, generally use non-related insurers. QSuper, which owns a life insurance company that provides cover to members, is an exception, Mr Kachor noted.</p>
      <p>Sunsuper and QSuper are in <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p537gd.html">the early stages</a> of merger talks to create $182 billion giant and it is not known what that will mean for the provision of insurance.</p>
      <p>Super funds will also have to show the level and type of insurance cover that is provided will not " inappropriately erode the retirement income of beneficiaries [members]".</p>
      <p>And members must be able to easily opt out of the insurance, which is likely a response to some funds making if difficult to opt out.</p>
      <p>The proposed changes are designed to strengthen the existing standards detailed in <a href="https://www.apra.gov.au/consultation-on-prudential-standard-sps-250-insurance-superannuation">Prudential Standard SPS 250, Insurance in Superannuation</a>.</p>
      <p>The regulator is consulting with the financial services industry on the changes until February 1, 2020. APRA intends to finalise the prudential standard by mid-2020 before coming into effect on January 1, 2021.</p>
