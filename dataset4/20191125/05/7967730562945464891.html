      <p>A bag filled with human excrement has been thrown at a bus driver in Melbourne's north before exploding over his face, hitting his eye and splattering across his driver's seat.</p>
      <p>The bus driver stopped to let a passenger off in Wollert at 9.40pm on November 13 when a bearded Caucasian man, aged 30 to 40, stepped onto the bus.</p>

      <p>The high-vis-clad man lobbed a plastic bag of poo at the driver before running off.</p>
      <p>"Obviously the faeces has gone all over the driver," acting Sergeant Todd Little told reporters on Monday.</p>
      <p>"The driver believes that it is human faeces.</p>
      <p>"It is quite runny so it has splattered throughout the driver compartment of the vehicle and it has gone onto the driver's face and into his eye."</p>

      <p>A number of small rocks were found inside the bag after it hit the safety security mesh and splattered throughout the driver's compartment.</p>
      <p>The attacker was wearing a beige beanie, a yellow and black high-visibility jumper with its hood up, and dark pants with a white stripe down each leg.</p>
      <p>The driver remains distressed and is yet to return to work, and is receiving ongoing medical and psychological help.</p>
      <p>"It is an absolutely disgusting act and we are doing our best to identify the male and hold him to account," acting Sergeant Todd said.</p>
      <p>Police wish to speak to anyone who saw the incident or the man described.</p>
