      <p>No matter how hectic your day was or how many coworkers got on your nerves (looking at you, <i>Karen</i>), there’s nothing a few strategically placed plants can’t fix. I mean it! There’s something so calming and relaxing about coming home to an apartment packed to the gills with beautiful greenery. Heck, I’d make my apartment look like an extra from <i>The Secret Garden</i> if my budget allowed. And if you live in a city, filling your space with plants can actually improve your health or, at the very least, level up the quality of the air you breathe at home.</p>
      <p>Assuming you’re new to the Greening Up Your Life Project, let’s set a few guidelines. You need a plant that’s low maintenance, which means it doesn’t require loads of natural light or lots of attentive care. You also need a plant small enough to fit on a bookshelf or a bedside table or maybe even on your desk at work once you’re feeling confident in your plant parenting skills. Basically, we are not here to talk orchids, people.</p>
      <p>Although the plants included here are easy to grow and take up little space, they will add a ton of lush jungle vibes to any room. Choose from this list of small indoor house plants—including aloe vera, succulents, and jade, to name a few—to get started. Oh, and obviously, you’ll need to grab a couple of cute decorative potters too, to make this whole endeavor Instagram official. Pretty soon, people might start mistaking you for a bona fide gardener. You ready?</p>

      <p>Fine, the Zs in this plant’s name technically stand for “Zamioculcas zamiifolia,” but I like to think they’re here to remind you that you could literally take care of this plant in your sleep. It’s that easy. Some people even call it unkillable. ZZ plants can grow in low light and you only need to water them every three to four weeks. Doesn’t get much more low maintenance than that.</p>

      <p>TBQH, the name “air plant” is mildly misleading—these little guys need a bit more than air to survive, but they <i>are</i> pretty simple to look after. All they need is a good soaking every one to two weeks and they’ll be happy as clams. Cute too.</p>

      <p>Some believe this plant will bring you success in areas of ~finance~, and while of course there’s no proof of that, it couldn’t hurt to try, amirite? At the very least, it won’t cost you much dough to buy or care for a Chinese money plant. (The price of this option includes the porcelain planter, btw.) These guys usually grow to be less than a foot tall and don’t need much in the way of water or additional fertilizers.</p>
      <h3>4 if you’re all about aesthetics Hoya Heart Plant</h3>

      <p>Let’s address the elephant in the room: This tropical succulent is cute as hell. Hoya kerrii—or as they’re affectionately known, hoya heart plants—love bright, direct light (although they’ll also tolerate bright, indirect light), and they only need to be watered every three to four weeks. Easy-peasy!</p>
      <h3>5 an easy hanging option String of Pearls Succulent</h3>

      <p>Caring for this fast-growing succulent is easy—all it needs is bright, indirect light and the occasional water (they like to dry out completely before you give ’em another dose of H2O). Seriously, do not overwater this lil guy—that’s the most important instruction. If you begin to feel confident in your plant parenting skills, you can even trim off a stem and replant it in another pot (experts call this “propagating”).</p>
      <h3>6 if you want a bit of color Polka-Dot Plant</h3>

      <p>The colorful dotted leaves of the—ready for this mouthful?—Hypoestes phyllostachya will add a little somethin’-somethin’ to any indoor plant collection. You’ll actually get the most color out of these guys when they’re in low lighting, so while you may groan about the fact that your apartment gets barely any sunlight, your polka-dot plant will love it.</p>
      <h3>7 the stylish one Haworthia Zebra</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1574698498-screen-shot-2019-11-25-at-11-13-38-am-1574698443.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=480:*"/>

      <p>This succulent might be mini, but don’t be fooled by its stature—it’s extremely hardy. Haworthia plants are pet-friendly and they thrive in bright, direct sunlight. You don’t need to water them more often than every three to four weeks, so in other words, they’re perfect for lazy plant parents.</p>
      <h3>8 the easygoing succulent Aloe Vera</h3>

      <p>If you are like me and could be second cousins with Casper the Friendly Ghost, you’re probably verrry familiar with aloe in its lotion form. Turns out, it’s also a pretty plant that’s perfect for apartment life! All your aloe needs is a decently sunny and warm spot and a minimal watering schedule. Plus, if you’re feeling really crafty, you can cut off the leaves and use them to make your own burn treatments, skincare, or even toothpaste.</p>
      <h3>9 the classic Baby Rubber Plant</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1574699032-screen-shot-2019-11-25-at-11-23-18-am-1574699019.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=480:*"/>

      <p>This plant’s proper name is Peperomia obtusfolia, but most people refer to it as a baby rubber plant, thanks to its thick spoon-shaped leaves. It can handle most lighting situations besides intense, direct sun (although it prefers medium to bright, indirect light above all) and should be watered every other week. If you’re lucky, your baby rubber plant will flower, growing narrow white spikes.</p>
      <h3>10 if you love flowers Anthurium</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1574699824-gettyimages-639411804-1574699815.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=480:*"/>

      <p>Although the anthurium plant can grow to be about a foot tall, it can still easily fit on the edge of any desk or bookshelf, and it’s so dang pretty that it’s kind of like having fresh flowers in your apartment at all times. Anthuriums will thrive in indirect or low light, but keep in mind, they’ll have fewer of those cute stamens if it gets only low light.</p>
      <h3>11 for a vine-y look Pothos</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1574700094-gettyimages-117982574-1574700087.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=480:*"/>

      <p>Another good plant for beginners, the tropical vine known as pothos will quickly grow under nearly any conditions—it just doesn’t like intense direct sunlight. Put this guy on a bookshelf and its long vines will make your space look extra lush.</p>
      <h3>12 the cactus option Moon Cactus</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1574700693-gettyimages-697413860-1574700671.jpg?crop=0.534xw:1.00xh;0,0&amp;resize=480:*"/>

      <p>A little cactus is pretty much the go-to easy-to-care-for apartment plant, but the moon cactus in particular adds a nice pop of color in addition to being truly super simple to keep alive. Get this: After your moon cactus is at least a year old, you don’t have to water it—at all!—during the winter.</p>
      <h3>13 the air purifier Peace Lily</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1574701454-il_570xN.1211862072_3kuo.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=480:*"/>

      <p>The peace lily will add an element of zen to your space, even when it’s surrounded by a week’s worth of laundry. But make sure to water this tropical plant only when the soil is completely dry, otherwise you’ll have an unhappy flower on your hands. According to research conducted by NASA (!!!!), peace lilies can help purify air.</p>
      <h3>14 the one that’ll live forever Jade Plant</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1574699947-screen-shot-2019-11-25-at-11-38-38-am-1574699938.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=480:*"/>

      <p>Okay, maybe not <i>forever</i>, but jade plants can live for a super-long time—like, we’re talking more than a decade. Jade plants love bright, direct light, and they only need to be watered every three to four weeks. If you want your jade plant to bring you good luck, read up on feng shui practices, which suggest placing the plant in specific locations in your home to yield certain outcomes (like prosperity and success!).</p>
