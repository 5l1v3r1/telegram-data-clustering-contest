      <p>Las Vegas has a hero: “Jeopardy! James” Holzhauer, who won $250,000 on the “Jeopardy!” Tournament of Champions. What an achievement. But what really makes him a hero is his dedication to his hometown, Las Vegas. He has made generous donations to organizations here, including the Las Vegas-Clark County Library District.
