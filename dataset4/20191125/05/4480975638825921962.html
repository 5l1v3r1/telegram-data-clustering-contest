      <h1>GBP/USD recovery attempt faces significant resistance — Confluence Detector</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:51:17+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/yohay-elam" target="_blank">Yohay Elam</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">GBP/USD</a> has been moving marginally higher as Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party has gained ground in the polls. Can cable extend its gains? It may struggle.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">Technical Confluences Indicator</a> is showing that fierce resistance is waiting at <b>1.2887</b>, which is the convergence of the Simple Moving Average 100-4h, the Fibonacci 38.2% one-week, the Fibonacci 61.8% one-day, the Bollinger Band 1h-Upper, and the BB one-day Middle. </p>
      <p>If pound/dollar succeeds in breaking higher, the target is <b>1.3013</b>, which is the meeting point of the Pivot Point one-day Resistance 3 and the previous monthly high. </p>
      <p>Support awaits at <b>1.2821</b>, which is the confluence of the BB 1h-Lower, the Fibonacci 23.6% one-month, and the previous daily low. </p>
      <p>If it loses that cushion, the next target is <b>1.2721</b>, where the PP one-week S2 and the 200-day SMA hits the price.</p>
      <p>This is how it looks on the tool:</p>

      <h3>Confluence Detector</h3>
      <p>The Confluence Detector finds exciting opportunities using Technical Confluences. The TC is a tool to locate and point out those price levels where there is a <b>congestion of indicators,</b> moving averages, <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci levels</a>, Pivot Points, etc. Knowing where these congestion points are located is very useful for the trader, and can be used as a basis for different strategies.</p>
      <p>This tool assigns a certain amount of “weight” to each indicator, and this “weight” can influence adjacents price levels. This means that one <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin">price level without any indicator</a> or moving average but under the influence of two “strongly weighted” levels accumulate more resistance than their neighbors. In these cases, the tool signals resistance in apparently empty areas.</p>
