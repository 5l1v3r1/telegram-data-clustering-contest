      <h1>Buttigieg’s ‘big tent’ appeal rises in Silicon Valley</h1>
      <h2>Tech friendly candidate wins influential backers for Democratic nomination</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:00:31+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Waters, Miles Kruppa</a></address>
      <p>When US investors and Silicon Valley power couple Matt Rogers and Swati Mylavarapu organised their first fundraising event for Pete Buttigieg in February, it was a small affair — 25 people in their living room. Now Mr Rogers says that whenever the 37-year-old candidate for the Democratic nomination stops in San Francisco, they have to book a venue big enough for 2,000 people.</p>
      <p>“It’s the fastest growing start-up I’ve ever seen,” said Mr Rogers, who co-founded the smart home device company Nest.<br/><br/>As support for Mr Buttigieg <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bdcb6dde-0b1f-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67">surged</a> in Iowa, the site of the first Democratic presidential primary in February, so too has his popularity among a different kind of constituency. Venture capitalists, start-up founders and tech workers have warmed to the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, backing him with their cheque books and social networks.</p>
      <p>Californians have contributed the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/2020-presidential-race/geography?id=N00044183">bulk</a> of Mr Buttigieg’s campaign funds, making up 22.1 per cent from individuals contributing more than $200 of his nearly $51m, which includes donations of smaller amounts raised through mid-October, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Mr Buttigieg’s $8.9m haul lags that of Kamala Harris, the California senator who has raised $13.4m from the state, but is more than double the amount raised by Cory Booker, the historically tech-friendly New Jersey senator.</p>
      <p>Supporters in Silicon Valley say Mr Buttigieg drew them with his youth, “big tent” rhetoric and policies that appear more practical than those of his rivals. Others see Mr Buttigieg, a Harvard-educated Rhodes Scholar and former McKinsey consultant, as a friendly candidate tailor-made for a tech industry facing a barrage of criticism from both Republicans and Democrats.<br/><br/>“He reflects the vision the Valley has of itself — smart, clean-cut, went to the right schools,” said Jeff Hauser, director of the Revolving Door Project, which scrutinises executive branch appointments. “I think Buttigieg regards Silicon Valley the way most Democrats did four or five years ago, but few do now.”</p>

      <p>Mr Buttigieg’s rise in California comes as the Democratic party grapples with the power of tech platforms such as Facebook, which has been blamed for fuelling the rise of Donald Trump’s 2016 candidacy.<br/><br/>Unlike Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, Mr Buttigieg has not advocated the break-up of the large tech companies. In an <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/7/15/20693930/mayor-pete-buttigieg-kara-swisher-recode-decode-podcast-interview-2020-presidential-race-racism-tech">interview</a> on the Recode Decode podcast, Mr Buttigieg expressed reservations about tech companies being “blown up at my whim”, adding that he is worried about “anti-competitive behaviour”.<br/><br/>Recently, Mr Buttigieg has been accused of being cosy with Mark Zuckerberg after hiring two staffers recommended by Mr Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan. He also hosted Mr Zuckerberg in South Bend during the Facebook chief executive's tour of the US in 2017.</p>

      <p>Mr Buttigieg has also shown an ability to unite people with different political leanings, his supporters say. They include some with the sort of strong libertarian preferences not normally drawn to Democratic candidates, such as tech investor Cyan Banister, a partner at billionaire Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, who identifies as “genderqueer” and “socially libertarian”.<br/><br/>“The Trump presidency has really been quite radicalising,” said Marc Bodnick, a former executive at the tech investment firm Silver Lake Partners. “Trump tapped into some real unhappiness. Pete is a candidate who can bring a lot of people on to the team.”</p>
      <p>Mr Bodnick said Mr Buttigieg’s appeal caught him off guard in May: he expected about 30 people to attend his fundraiser for the candidate. But in a matter of weeks, 125 guests had signed up.</p>

      <p>Silicon Valley and California could prove increasingly important for Democratic candidates next year, following former governor Jerry Brown's decision to move the state’s primary up to the “Super Tuesday” voting period in March.<br/><br/>But Mr Buttigieg’s momentum in Iowa has yet to translate to the western coast state, where he has faced difficulties winning black and Hispanic voters. Data from Real Clear Politics <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/ca/california_democratic_primary-6879.html">showed</a> Mr Buttigieg polling in fifth with 6.7 per cent of the vote, behind Mrs Harris.</p>
      <p>Many of Silicon Valley’s largest donors, such as LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, have also opted to spread bets between multiple candidacies. Entrepreneur and tech investor Sam Altman is planning to fundraise for Mr Buttigieg after recently hosting an event for Andrew Yang, the former tech executive known for his universal basic income proposals.<br/><br/>“People in the venture community have a different view of handicapping organisations and individuals than . . . traditional East Coast channels do,” said Scott Krisiloff, political adviser to Mr Altman. “That is showing up in willingness to support early on two candidates who would have been perceived as total dark horses.”</p>
      <p>Jacob Helberg, a news products policy adviser at Google, said a fundraiser he hosted for Mr Buttigieg attracted supporters who had not previously made large political donations. Mr Helberg’s husband Keith Rabois, a Founders Fund partner known as one of Silicon Valley’s most prominent conservatives, helped recruit supporters for the candidate.<br/><br/>“There were a lot of young people,” Mr Helberg said. “There were gays, straights, African Americans, Hispanics, libertarians, vegetarians, you name it.”</p>
