      <p>The history of some of the most iconic places in West Cork are explored through the pages of a new illustrated book that charts the character and the beauty of the region.</p>
      <p>50 Gems of West Cork by Kieran McCarthy, a local historian, author, and Cork City councillor, takes the reader through the heritage of the landscapes and seascapes of the south-western corner of Ireland.</p>
      <p>From Bandon to Dursey Island, and from Gougane Barra to the Healy Pass, Mr McCarthy seeks out the unique heritage of each of the 50 places mapped out, providing insights into how it gives them their personality.</p>

      <p>Including 100 illustrations and photographs of some of West Cork’s best scenery, the book considers the history behind some of the region’s landmarks.</p>
      <p>These include the Ford Model T sculpture in Ballinascarty, the Courtmacsherry Lifeboat Station, and Drombeg Stone Circle.</p>
      <p>Inchydoney Island, Timoleague Abbey, Fastnet Rock, and Mizen Head, Ireland’s most southerly point, also feature.</p>

      <p>Writing in the book’s bio, Mr McCarthy says that he drew from digitised past editions of the Cork Examiner and The Southern Star, which are available on the Irish Newspaper Archive, to glean as much information as he could about different points of each site’s development.</p>
      <p>“Researching West Cork, the visitor discovers that each parish has its own local historian, historical society, village council, sometimes a library, tidy town’s group, community group and business community, which have inspired the collection of stories, the creation of heritage trails and information panels, and have championed a strong sense of place and identity,” writes Mr McCarthy.</p>

      <p>“Looking closely at the human detail of a building, statue or view can reveal nuances about how places are seen and understood and ultimately can be championed going forward into the future.”</p>
      <p>This latest publication by Mr McCarthy follows West Cork Through Time which explored the fascination of postcard makers 100 years ago with the region’s scenery, culture, and people.</p>
