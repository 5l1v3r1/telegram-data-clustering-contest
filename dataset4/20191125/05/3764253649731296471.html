      <h3>Vivo S5 review</h3>
      <p>Here are what some people said about the new handset on YouTube.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shinjuko Altabano: <i>Diamond shaped camera looks different it's much better if it's round... anyways.. it's just my opinion</i>.</li>
        <li>S6 Updates: <i>It'll sell like Hot Cakes in Markets like India and China. Vivo has their own fan base which includes majority of Girls. Design looks 10/10, Camera seems Good, Battery is also Good.. what else Girls want?</i></li>
        <li>Vimal reigns: <i>At that price point there is a 108mp phone and also there is a snapdragon 855+ phone so no need of s5.</i></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>If you are to pick the best smartphone from the Vivo S series, then S5 is a perfect choice. You can, however, consider other devices with a more powerful processor and that are relatively cheap like Google Pixel 3A, Galaxy S9 SCV38, and <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1262064-xiaomi-mi-9--review-price.html">Xiaomi Mi 9</a> among others.</p>
