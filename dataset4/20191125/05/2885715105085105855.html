      <p>Haryana’s Johads (community-owned rainwater storage wetland mainly used for harnessing water resources) are all set for a revamp. The state government has come out with a plan of rehabilitating over 16,400 ponds in rural areas across the state in order to analyze pond water to ascertain its suitability for irrigation and other uses.</p>
      <p>To analyse water resources, other than canal water, for irrigation purposes, Haryana’s Pond and Waste Management Authority in coordination with various departments of the state government has started surveying these ponds. <i><a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a></i> explains the state government’s plan of action for this ambitious project:</p>
      <p>
        <b>How did the pond rehabilitation begin in Haryana?</b>
      </p>
      <p>In April this year, Haryana’s Pond and Waste Management Authority on the National Green Tribunal’s orders asked urban local bodies to identify water bodies under their jurisdiction and assign them a unique identification number so that data can be collected for the preservation of such water bodies. Currently, three departments — animal husbandry and dairying, irrigation and urban local bodies — are coordinating with the Pond and Waste Management Authority — governed by Haryana’s Pond and Waste Management Authority Act — to rehabilitate ponds across Haryana.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What is Haryana’s Pond and Waste Management Authority Act?</b>
      </p>
      <p>An Act to establish an authority in the State for development, protection, rejuvenation, conservation, construction and management of pond, utilisation of pond water and treatment thereof, to manage and utilise treated effluent of sewage effluent treatment plants for irrigation, thereby reducing over-exploitation of ground water.</p>
      <p>The Authority’s primary functions are to conduct survey and study the ponds, their boundaries and protected areas, to analyze pond water for ascertaining its suitability for irrigation and other uses, to take steps for regulation, control, protection, cleaning, beautification, conservation, reclamation, regeneration, restoration and construction of ponds, to make environmental impact assessment of the ponds, to develop infrastructure including pumping machinery, channels and pipe systems for utilization of pond water and effluent of sewage effluent treatment plants for irrigation.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How is the government identifying the ponds?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The government has created a Pond Data Management Software and started generating a 21-digit unique identification number each such water body. A detailed database was prepared collecting details including name and type of water body (ponds, lakes, reservoirs), rural or urban, water conservation schemes, name of basin and sub-basin in which it is located and whether it falls in a drought-prone or floor-prone area. Under the Act, no person is allowed to construct any structure on pond land, green belt and catchment areas, occupy any pond land or part thereof or cause any obstruction in the natural or normal course of inflow or outflow of water into or from the pond on the upstream or down-stream without permission of the authority.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are model ponds?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Haryana Pond and Waste Water Management Authority shall now be developing 18 model ponds on a pilot project basis and based on it, a future action plan will be prepared for renovation of other ponds. Beautification, demarcation of area for fishing and animals, conservation of water to be used for irrigation purposes shall be the main focus of model ponds. To begin with, each district of the state shall have a model pond each. Government officials claim that with this, Haryana will become the first state in the country to have a model village pond in each district.</p>
      <p>The Command Area Development Authority (CADA) of Haryana has also taken up a pilot project for installation of solar powered micro irrigation infrastructure on 11 overflowing ponds of 11 villages of four districts costing over Rs 3.74 crore. After successful implementation of these 11 schemes, similar project will be replicated in the remaining identified overflowing ponds in the state.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What is the Haryana government doing to rehabilitate ponds?</b>
      </p>
      <p>For solid and liquid waste management, rehabilitation of 1,323 ponds is being done by Panchayati Raj department, of which work on 465 has been completed. Besides this, 16,458 ponds have been identified in rural areas, of which 15,946 are located in half acre land and above 6,498 are dirty water ponds, 7,554 are used for cattle, 407 for fisheries, and 74 for irrigation, apart from 1,413 other ponds.</p>
      <p>Similarly, 639 ponds have been identified in urban areas, of which 600 ponds are located in half acres and above, 210 dirty water ponds, 140 ponds are used for animals, 16 ponds for fisheries, 55 ponds are used for irrigation and there are other 179 ponds.</p>
      <p>The maximum number of ponds are located in Hisar district (1353), followed by 1,182 in Jind and 1,130 in Sonipat district. Panchkula district has the lowest number of ponds — 192 — in its jurisdiction.</p>
