      <h1>PlayStation 5 Might Be Released On 20 Nov 2020 For US$499; To Come With 2TB SSD</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:50:17+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/ian/" target="_blank">Ian Chee</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/195967/sony-playstation-5-official-date-holiday-2020/">Sony PlayStation 5</a> (PS5) is scheduled to be announced at the end of next year. It’s a broad window, but now a leaker has claimed to know the exact date of the console’s launch. Not only that, they also claim to know the price tag that will accompany the console at launch.</p>
      <p>Twitter user @PSErebus has posted a series of tweets which relate to the history of the console series of sorts. But two of them stand out. One says that the PS5 will be available in North America on 20 November 2020 for US$499 (~RM2084). The other states the launch price in Europe and the UK, as well as the claim that the PS5 will launch with a 2TB SSD.</p>

      <p>That last one sounds a little too good to be true, especially considering the price of the console itself. While there’s little doubt that the PS5 will have SSD’s as its storgae medium, one of that capacity would cost almost half the asking price of the PS5, assuming these leaks are accurate. But considering the console’s games will come in physical disks of 100GB, it will definitely need a large storage drive to store a reasonable number of games.</p>

      <p>At any rate, the only way to know if these leaks are accurate is to wait for Sony to officially announce the PlayStation 5. BGR reports that this could happen as soon as February 2020, but it’s probably better to take even that with a pinch of salt for now.</p>
