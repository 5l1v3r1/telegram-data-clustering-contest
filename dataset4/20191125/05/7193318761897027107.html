      <h1>BBB offers special holiday season tips for businesses and consumers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:01:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:01</time> by <a rel="author">Eddie Roach</a></address>
      <p>Better Business Bureau of Central Oklahoma wants everyone to know they are more than just a place to report businesses for poor performance.</p>
      <p>While business reviews and complaints are an important part of their service, they offer a wide range of other services for businesses and consumers, including special holiday season planning resources so businesses can make the most of the busiest shopping season.</p>
      <p>“We want people to look at us as a resource,” said Kitt Letcher, President and CEO. “Black Friday and Small Business Saturday are fast approaching. As shoppers are gearing up to fulfill their holiday shopping lists, we are offering tips on best practices to prepare for the holiday shopping weekend.”</p>
      <p>Some of the ideas, advice, tips include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure online listings, social media platforms and other extensions of your website are up to date and accurate.</li>
        <li>If your office is closed during the holiday shopping weekend, consider partnering with neighboring businesses by providing coupons or handouts, that neighboring stores could pass out, on your behalf.</li>
        <li>Decorate your store/place of business and don’t shy away from a theme.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>“We have a special <u><a href="https://bbbcentralokholidays.com/">holiday website</a></u> which includes many more tips for businesses,” Letcher added.</p>

      <p>In addition to the downloadable checklists, businesses can find resources like daily social media tips, ideas on how to set your business up for success during the holidays, and ideas on how to set your business apart from competitors.</p>
      <p>“Follow us on social media, @BBBCentralOk for daily holiday planning tips,” Letcher said. “Our social media posts provide daily reminders, action steps and more for your business to make this holiday season a success.”</p>
      <p>The <u><a href="https://bbbcentralokholidays.com/">website</a></u> also includes links to accredited and non-accredited business, along with consumer resource links. Her recommendations for consumers to make the most of the season include creating a budget and making a list of retail shops you want to visit. Be sure to ask store owners about their holiday return policy.</p>
      <p>“As you begin to form a plan for holiday shopping, consider searching local businesses for Small Business Saturday on <u><a href="https://www.bbb.org/local-bbb/better-business-bureau-of-central-oklahoma">bbb.org/oklahomacity</a></u>,” Letcher said.</p>
      <p>Business profiles show how long they have been in business, whether they are accredited by Better Business Bureau, what their BBB Rating is, and any customer reviews or complaints. For some businesses, there is a direct link to receive a quote for services.</p>
      <p>“We want to be a resource for consumers,” Letcher said. “Just call and ask your questions. We can definitely connect people with the right resources.” She noted there is a special <u><a href="https://www.bbb.org/oklahomacity/crc">consumer resources</a></u> page that provides tips year-round for topics ranging from taxes, to automotive, to weddings and more.</p>
      <p>Accreditation means the business meets BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review and monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.</p>
      <p>BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.</p>
      <p>BBB ratings represent the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers based on information obtained about the business, including complaints received from the public. BBB seeks and uses information directly from businesses and from public data sources.</p>
      <p>BBB assigns ratings from A+ (highest) to F (lowest). In some cases, BBB will not rate the business (indicated by an NR, or "No Rating") for reasons that include insufficient information about a business or ongoing review/update of the business's file.</p>
      <p>For businesses, after making sure they are ready for the holiday shopping season, Letcher encourages them to take these steps to finalize year-end planning. These include: create a plan for the upcoming year, develop assets to launch marketing efforts, and finalize any new services or features which will be offered in the upcoming year, and create assets to support those programs. Also, start conversations with potential partners to your business for events, programs and more.</p>
      <p>Letcher pointed to several opportunities businesses have to make use of services and programs offered by Better Business Bureau.</p>
      <p>“Trust Talks are our biggest outreach,” she said. “These are a monthly lunch, learn and networking series promoting a deeper understanding of best business practices and innovative concepts to help your business grow.”</p>
      <p>In a recent Trust Talk, Midfirst Bank shared the importance of having financial education programs in place for employees. Among the highlights were that 80% of employees indicate they would participate if financial education were available in the workplace. Financial knowledge will increase an employee’s ability and confidence to make quality financial decisions, reduce financial problems, thus enabling more focus and energy on work activities.</p>
