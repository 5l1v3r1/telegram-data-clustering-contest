      <p><a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/07/star-wars-galaxys-edges-big-new-ride-is-coming-to-disney-world-this-december"><i>Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge</i></a> is at the cutting edge (heh) of <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/08/the-immersive-star-wars-hotel-will-feel-like-a-cruise-ship-and-now-has-a-name">reality imitating fiction</a>, with Disney spending massive sums of money on converting a little pocket of its park to looking, feeling, <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/08/you-cant-bring-galaxys-edge-coke-bottles-on-planes-because-the-tsa-thinks-they-look-like-bombs">tasting</a>, and smelling like it’s really a part of the <i>Star Wars</i> universe, only with many more opportunities to give Disney your money.</p>
      <p>But this next endeavour, as reported by <a href="http://www.theforce.net/story/front/Disney_Testing_XWing_Drones_The_Size_Of_SUVs_For_Galaxys_Edge_185734.asp">TheForce.net</a>, is taking things to a whole ‘nother level. What is Disney doing? They are currently testing two X-Wing drones <i>the size of cars</i> to, (emphasis mine), “<i>fly over the land</i> during a one-time media event scheduled for December.” It’s worth noting that these are one-time only experiments, for a media event, and these specific devices will probably not be seen by the public.</p>
      <p>But just. Let me reiterate. These are <i>flying, car-sized drones</i> shaped like X-Wings. Which basically just means they’re real-life X-Wings. That fly. In the sky. Yeah, sure, that’s not space, but it’s something.</p>
      <p>Oh, here’s a picture of the in-progress drones, courtesy of MickeyBlog:</p>

      <p>It’s making me excited for the second version of <i>Galaxy’s Edge</i>, which will probably just involve getting shot by lasers in space.</p>
