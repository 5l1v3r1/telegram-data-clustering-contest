      <h1>Birmingham's Ivory Wave, Dream Nights - EP review</h1>
      <h2>There's a big buzz around Birmingham right now, with the 'B-Town' scene grabbing the attention of musical moguls the country over.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/leigh-sanders/" target="_blank">Leigh Sanders</a></address>
      <p>One of the releases to garner the most hope and expectation is this five-track EP from Brummie indie-dance boys Ivory Wave.</p>
      <p>And while it stands up to criticism and delights at times with those airy atmospherics, it doesn't quite live up to the social media hype.</p>

            <b>Ivory Wave release new single Uptown</b>
          </a>

      <p>There's plenty to love. The happy nature of Uptown with that shout-along chorus and stomping beats will prove popular wherever they play - such as at Digbeth's The Legitimate Peaky Blinders festival this year. Jangling guitars accompany happy-go-lucky vocals from frontman George Johnson and it's the kind of beer-can-fuelled house party anthem you'd expect.</p>
      <p>It's accompanied with the funky and foot-tapping Pale Moonlight. Accented delivery from Johnson spews forth in almost guttural fashion before things open up for a real pop-jangler of a chorus. The dance vibes tucked within leave you recalling The Music.</p>
      <p>But this track more than most leaves you feeling like a little oomph was lost somewhere along the way. The production from Matt Terry (The Prodigy, You Me At Six) upon recording at VADA Studios, Warwickshire, and mixing from Grammy Award-winner Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse, Everything Everything) leaves it polished. But some gravitas feels extracted and the party vibe can feel a little shallow.</p>
      <p>Further examples are opener The Middle and Weigh Me Down. The Stone Roses-esque latter number is clearly aimed at fans of that genre, and why not? They site the Mancunians as major influences so channel that love by all means.</p>
      <p>The Middle does feel slightly heavier and full or a more raw energy powering it from start to finish. Seb Baldwin's percussion and the bass of Luke Morris really work here as they weave a delightful engine together that allows Connor McMin's guitar to dance.</p>
      <p>The EP's finest moment is the emotive Young Blood that starts with a Young Aviators-style guitar ode to youthfulness before opening up into a vast wall of sound that thumps off your eardrums and features some excellent vocal support from Birmingham Community Gospel Choir.</p>
      <p>Solid foundations from which to flourish from. There's nothing wrong with planting your feet firmly before pushing on - and the prospects look good for this positive mouthpiece for Birmingham's youth.</p>
