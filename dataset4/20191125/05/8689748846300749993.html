      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:57:07+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/sergent/" target="_blank">BB Jones</a></address>
      <p>A Ghanaian man by name Osman Hafiz is buzzing the internet after he got married to three women at the same time in Walewale, the capital of the West Mamprusi District in the North East Region of Ghana.</p>
      <p>The ceremony which lasted for an hour and a half on Saturday November 23, 2019, saw Hafiz marry Karima, Sikena and Huzaima.</p>
      <p>Although polygamy is an accepted form of marriage in Islam, this is the first time we have seen anything of that sort from Ghana and Africa as a whole.</p>
      <p>In fact, he is even entitled to another wife per Islamic laws, which limits the number of wives a man can take to four.</p>
      <p>The ceremony which lasted for an hour and a half on Saturday November 23, 2019, saw Hafiz marry Karima, Sikena and Huzaima.</p>
