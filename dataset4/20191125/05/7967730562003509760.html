      <p>Queensland Police on Monday doubled the reward to $500,000 for information that leads to solving the April 11, 2012 murder.</p>
      <p>Mr Lazzaro was repeatedly shot in front of his 19-year-old daughter at their Rochedale home, south of Brisbane.</p>
      <p>She was unharmed as she frantically phoned triple zero.</p>
      <p>Intruders also shot the 56-year-old's Rottweiler-cross, Kilo, in the back but the dog survived.</p>
      <p>More than 150 statements have been taken but police are no closer to solving the case, Detective Inspector Mark White said.</p>
      <p>"We know there were two offenders inside the house, but we believe there may have been some other people involved," he said.</p>
      <p>"We are hoping that (the reward) is going to be an incentive for people if they do have information, to reconsider whether they sit on that information or if they contact the police and come forward.</p>
      <p>"I'm convinced someone in the community knows and can assist us, and that is why we are appealing for that person or persons to come forward and help us out."</p>
      <p>Police found empty shell casings and a handgun when they searched Mr Lazzaro's Priestdale Road home after his murder.</p>
