      <p>Graduation rates within the Okanagan Skaha School District for the 2018/19 year fell below 80 per cent, according to new data going before the board Monday.</p>
      <p>Of 643 students, 79.4 per cent of students achieved graduation within six years of entering Grade 8, down from 85.3 per cent the previous year. The six year completion rate has hovered near that figure, but was as high as 87.1 per cent in 2014/15.</p>
      <p>The data shows that 91 per cent of students that entered Grade 12 last year graduated in the same school year, indicating many students that drop out do so before their senior year.</p>
      <p>The numbers improve if international students and non-residents are excluded from the mix: 85.7 per cent of resident students graduated within six years, with 92 per cent of seniors completing Grade 12.</p>
      <p>Six-year completion rates for Indigenous students slid last year to 65.4 per cent, down from a high of 75.5 per cent in 2016/17. Eighty-six per cent of Indigenous Grade 12 students last year graduated.</p>
      <p>SD 67 includes schools in Penticton, Summerland, Naramata and Kaleden.</p>
      <p>Also included in this week's agenda, the school district published its annual required "sunshine list," disclosing salaries for everyone over $75,000 a year. The top five earners at SD 67 are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wendy Hyer, Superintendent: $185,000</li>
        <li>Kevin Lorenz, Secretary Treasurer: $161,000 </li>
