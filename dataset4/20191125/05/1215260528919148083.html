      <h1>Cuban nurses take a year to learn Patois</h1>

      <p>With the constant migration of Jamaican nurses to North America, the Ministry of Health and Wellness continues to recruit nurses from overseas to address the trend of attrition.</p>
      <p>Last year, the health sector lost just over 500 nurses, and up to October 2019, the number had surpassed 460.</p>
      <p>However, president of the Nurses Association of Jamaica Carmen Johnson has asserted that while the recruited nurses help to ease the burden on the nursing staff, there are challenges.</p>
      <p>“I’ll put it in the words of some of those whom I’ve had meetings with – they said to me, ‘Madam President, I think we should get a three-year contract because it takes us one year to learn the language and to learn healthcare in Jamaica, and by [the time] we learn it, we only have one year to function, and then we’re gone,” Johnson said at a Gleaner Editors’ Forum at the newspaper’s North Street offices on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The president added that even after a year, some nurses have difficulty communicating with patients who speak mainly Patois.</p>
      <p>Johnson said that another challenge is that the nurses come to Jamaica with specialist skills and are being asked to function in general practice.</p>
      <p>“When you take these individuals to work in your general setting, wherever you need them, it has its shortcomings,” she said.</p>
      <h3>Learning curve</h3>
      <p>Johnson said it takes the nurses a while to get to understand how they are expected to examine patients, and then come up with nursing diagnoses and plans of care to treat them.</p>
      <p>While the nurses undergo training, for the first few months, hospitals will only have increased staff, but not added hands.</p>
      <p>She said that in the few instances when nurses are placed in their area of specialisation, they are still not able to function fully but can assist with familiar tasks.</p>
      <p>The latest addition to the local nursing crop was in September, when more than 130 Cuban nurses were temporarily placed in the health sector.</p>
