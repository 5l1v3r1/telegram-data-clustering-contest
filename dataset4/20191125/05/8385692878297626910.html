      <p>Amazon has a <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">really good deal</a> on the Jabra Elite 65t truly wireless headphones right now. You can pick them up for just $99.</p>
      <p>Now that's a really good price for any pair of truly wireless headphones, but the Jabra Elite 65t are perhaps the best out there, and getting these for $99 is a steal.</p>
      <p>Normally, the Jabra Elite 65t would cost you $169, but today you can get them for just $99. That is also their lowest price all-time.</p>

      <p>The Jabra Elite 65t are a really great pair of truly wireless headphones. They fit in your ears quite nicely, and don't feel like they are going to fall out. Of course, Jabra also includes three different sets of ear tips to go with the 65t's. So that you can choose the ones that fit your ears the best.</p>
      <p>On top of that, the Jabra Elite 65t also have some really good sounding audio. With plenty of bass, and you can adjust them with the Android app, if you want a bit less bass, or even more bass. The mids and highs are also crystal clear.</p>
      <p>But, perhaps what really makes the Jabra Elite 65t a popular pair of truly wireless headphones, is the battery life. We're looking at around five to six hours on a single charge. That is pretty impressive, considering most other truly wireless headphones of this size are closer to around four. The included carrying case will get you two full charges â€“ for 15 hours total.</p>

      <p>That carrying case isn't super large, so the fact that it only gets you around two full charges is not a big surprise, at all. But still nice to have, and it fits in your pocket quite nicely.</p>
