      <p>Senior Congress leaders <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shashi-tharoor">Shashi Tharoor </a>and Manish Tiwari met former finance minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/p-chidambaram">P Chidambaram </a>in Tihar Jail here on Monday.</p>
      <p>Chidambaram was first arrested by the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/central-bureau-of-investigation">Central Bureau of Investigation </a>(CBI) on August 21 in the INX Media corruption case and was granted bail by the Supreme Court on October 22.</p>
      <p>The senior Congress leader was also arrested by the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/enforcement-directorate">Enforcement Directorate </a>(ED) in the money-laundering case on October 16 and is in judicial custody till November 27 under the order of a trial court.</p>
      <p>"Today, the Constitution's basic commitment to liberty is being violated. 98 days today...for what? Rs 9.96 lakh, which is not even a controversial issue since there is a cheque involved...it sends a very bad signal...if we treat our respectable, upright citizens this way, it sends a very wrong signal to the world. We came to show our solidarity with him," Tharoor told reporters after meeting Chidambaram.</p>
      <p>Tharoor and Tiwari were accompanied by Chidambaram's son Karti.</p>
      <p>"Allegedly, a bribe of Rs 9.96 lakh has been given...Chidambaram is the country's seniormost lawyer, he can make this money within 10 seconds of appearing in court.</p>
      <p>"Tomorrow is Constitution Day and there is a golden triangle in our Constitution -- Articles 14, 19 and 21 -- this means that the rights under the Constitution need to be protected. His (Chidambaram's) bail plea will be heard in the Supreme Court tomorrow and we hope that a right decision is taken, based on the Constitution, and that he will get relief from the illegal way in which he has been kept in custody," Tiwari told reporters.</p>
