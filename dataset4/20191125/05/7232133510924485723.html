      <h3>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In the past few days, bitcoin cash price started a sharp decline below the $265 support against the US Dollar. BCH tumbled below many supports near $250 and $235 to move into a bearish zone. Moreover, there was a break below the $210 support and the price is now trading below the $200 support level.</p>
      <p>The next immediate support is near the $185 level, where the bulls may emerge. On the upside, the previous supports near $210 and $215 are likely to act as hurdles in the near term.</p>
      <h3>Litecoin (LTC), EOS and Stellar (XLM) Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Litecoin price is down sharply and it settled below the $50.00 support. LTC price even broke the $45.00 support area and it is now approaching the $42.00 support area. If there are more losses, the next support is seen near the $40.00 level. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the $45.50 and $46.20 levels.</p>
      <p>EOS price is down close to 10% and it broke many supports near the $2.500 level. The price is now trading near the $2.350 support and it could continue to move down towards the $2.250 level. On the upside, there are many hurdles for a recovery near the $2.500 and $2.550 levels.</p>
      <p>Cardano price is tumbling and now trading well below the key $0.0500 and $0.0450 support levels. ADA price is trading below the $0.0350 support and it is approaching the $0.0320 support. Any further losses might call for a test of the $0.0305 level.</p>
