      <h1>Khap leader says love marriages ‘unacceptable’ and ‘will never allow it’</h1>
      <h2>Parents should have a say in the selection of the life partner of their daughters, says Naresh Tikait</h2>

      <p>Chief of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) and head of the Baliyan Khap of Jats Naresh Tikait has said that “love marriages are not acceptable and the ‘Khap’ will never allow it”.</p>
      <p>In a video that is gaining traction on social media, Mr. Tikait could be heard saying that parents these days spent ₹30-40 lakhs on the education of their girls and then they go and marry somebody of their choice. “This is not right. When they spend on their nurturing, parents should have a say in the selection of the life partner of their daughters.” He said his appeal was not just for girls but boys as well. “But it is more directed towards girls, as they are the ‘izzat’ (pride) of the family. Such actions lower the pride of the family in society.”</p>
      <p>The video was recorded at a community convention of Jats in Baghpat last Friday.</p>
      <p>Senior leader and BKU spokesperson Rakesh Tikait told <i>The Hindu </i>that the guidelines were more about love marriages within the ‘gotra’<i>. “</i>The ‘Khap’ is open to inter-caste marriages, most of which are love marriages, among equivalent caste groups. We attend such marriages but marriages within the ‘gotra’ are still looked down upon, despite the Supreme Court directions. Villagers still boycott such weddings as it is against their customs,” said Mr. Rakesh.</p>
      <p>He said the ‘Khap’ had accepted that love marriage was a reality these days. “Their numbers are increasing with the movement of our children to cities for jobs. But the children should understand that love and marriage are two different things. In our society, it is a kind of pact between two families. Parents should also understand that the forced separation of lovers is not a solution. Youngsters understand their rights under the law, and social pressure doesn’t work on them. It is better to turn love marriages into arranged marriages.”</p>
