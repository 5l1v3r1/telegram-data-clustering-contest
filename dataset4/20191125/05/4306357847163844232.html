      <h2>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has his say on Arsenal's recent form under Unai Emery</h2>

      <h3>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has admitted that he cannot pinpoint the reason for Arsenal’s recent struggles under Unai Emery.</h3>
      <p>The Gunners left it late to claim a 2-2 draw with Southampton in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon as their winless run in the top flight continued.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are now without a win in five Premier League games and their stuttering form has caused them to drop well off the pace in the race for Champions League qualification.</p>
      <p>Their stuttering form has inevitably heaped pressure on manager Emery and it remains to be seen what the future holds for the Spanish head coach.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang was asked to explain Arsenal’s recent struggles after the game on Saturday but he was unable to provide a concrete explanation.</p>
      <p>Asked to pinpoint the reason for Arsenal’s struggles, Aubameyang is quoted as saying by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/pierre-emerick-aubameyang-sends-message-arsenal-fans-disappointing-southampton-draw-11207465/">Metro</a>: “I don’t know. Sincerely, I don’t know.</p>
      <p>“I think everybody has to try to ask themselves that, and what they can change, what they can give more of.</p>
      <p>“Everybody has to do this, me first. I will try to work hard and to get back to winning ways.”</p>
      <p>Aubameyang has scored eight goals in 13 Premier League games this season.</p>
      <p>Arsenal will return to Premier League action next weekend with a trip to Norwich City in the top flight.</p>
      <p>The north London side are in Europa League action on Thursday night when they take on Eintracht Frankfurt in the European competition.</p>
