      <p>With the aim of implementing natural disaster protection works, including rural development and poverty reduction, the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation plans to implement Resilient Community Development Project (RCDP) from 2019-20 to 2025-26 fiscal year. </p>
      <p>According to the Global Climate Risk Index 2017, Myanmar is on the list of the countries  most affected by extreme weather events. Due to natural disasters, those living in disaster-prone areas, those with livelihoods affected by climate  change and those who have no knowledge about natural disaster protection are experiencing more losses. As a result, they have to live below the poverty line, said Deputy Minister Hla Kyaw. </p>
      <p>Disaster risk reduction should be put in sustainable development and poverty reduction projects. Based on that point, the ministry plans to implement the RCDP. </p>
      <p>The main objective of RCDP is to promote the income and living standards of rural families through the public participation in regional development tasks and to enhance the people’s resilience to natural disasters. </p>
      <p>Rural Development Department conducted a preliminary survey in cooperation with Asian Development Bank (ADB) for one year in 2018. The project design has been created. According to the project design, the project is estimated to cost 244.95 million US dollars. </p>
      <p>In his opening speech at the 11th ASEAN Ministers Meeting on Rural Development and Poverty Eradication (AMRDPE) and related meetings in Nay Pyi Taw on November 8,  Vice-President Henry Van Thio said the government needs to organize the public to encourage the private sector participation in the field of rural development and poverty reduction.  </p>
