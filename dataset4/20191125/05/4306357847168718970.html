      <h2>Craig Burley says Manchester United should try to sign Leicester star James Maddison</h2>

      <h3>Manchester United have been urged to sign Leicester City midfielder James Maddison by Craig Burley.</h3>
      <p>The Red Devils have been regularly linked with the English midfielder over the past couple of months.</p>
      <p>Maddison has been one of the key players in Brendan Rodgers’ impressive Leicester side in the current campaign.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has scored four goals and has made two assists in 12 games in the Premier League this term.</p>
      <p>The Leicester playmaker was handed his England debut in their 7-0 victory over Montenegro in their Uefa 2020 qualifier.</p>
      <p>Former Chelsea FC defender Burley believes Manchester United should consider a swoop to sign to Maddison.</p>
      <p>“Of course they’d be interested in him and I believe they’re interested in him,” Burley told ESPN FC.</p>
      <p>“Not before the end of the season because we don’t know what Leicester are going to do.</p>
      <p>“It could be a great season for Leicester City, he’s a big part of that.</p>
      <p>“United did want [Youri] Tielemans and Leicester managed to coax him into coming there.</p>
      <p>“So you’re talking about trying to convince a guy who potentially is going to get an offer in the summer from Man United as I say.</p>
      <p>“If they sold him in January, Brendan Rodgers might as well pack his bags and go.</p>
      <p>“So I don’t think it will happen then but there’s potential for that to happen in the summer.”</p>
      <p>Maddison has netted 11 times in 47 games in the Premier League over the past two seasons since his move to Leicester from Norwich City in a £20m deal in 2018.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils have already raided Leicester City on one occasion this year after Manchester United signed Harry Maguire in a £80m deal from the Foxes in the summer.</p>
      <p>In doing so, Manchester United made Maguire the most expensive defender in the world ahead of the Liverpool FC centre-half Virgil van Dijk.</p>
      <p>The 20-time English champions have been linked with a host of English players since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer took over the reins from Jose Mourinho back in December.</p>
