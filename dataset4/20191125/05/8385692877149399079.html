      <p>Amazon has the 32-inch Insignia 720p Fire TV <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">on sale</a> today for just $99. Saving you $80 0ff of its regular price, making this a great time to pick one up.</p>
      <p>Now you might be wondering why anyone would want a 720p TV in 2019. Well, it's great to put into a guest bedroom, a second bedroom or even your kids bedroom. And since it is 32-inches, it's a pretty good size to go into a bedroom too.</p>
      <p>If you're using it to watch cable, then this resolution is perfectly fine. Since most content on cable is still in 720p (if you're lucky).</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>As far as ports go, there are 3 HDMI including 1 with ARC, USB, composite input, antenna/cable input, digital output (optical), audio output, Ethernet. Which is pretty much the standard array of ports for a TV today.</p>
      <p>There's also Fire TV built-in here, which has a lot of the apps that you'd expect from a streaming TV platform in 2019. This includes Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Netflix, Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu and so much more. Just about any app that you can think of, is going to be available on Fire TV. So there's plenty of content to watch on your new TV.</p>
      <p>This TV is a really good value actually, especially at $99. Insignia is Best Buy's store brand, so don't expect this to have an incredible picture â€“ plus its only 720p. But for most people, this is going to be a totally capable TV for a number of reasons. It might not be suitable for use in your living room, given its size and resolution, but for a spare bedroom, this is going to be perfect. That way you can offer your guests a TV in their room when they stay at your home.</p>
