      <p>Drape dresses can look beautiful if worn correctly. However, there are times when these drapes can look awful too. And guess what two of Bollywood hottest actresses have committed the blunder. It's Kriti Sanon and Kareena Kapoor Khan. </p>
      <p>You may recall, Kareena Kapoor Khan had worn a Ziad Germanos dark green leather tube dress with a light geen drape around the waist for one of the episodes of Dance India Dance. We had also brought to you a fashion report on the same and unfortunately Bebo's score card ran in minus. </p>

      <p>A day back, we saw Kriti Sanon repeat the blunder. She was also spotted in a black dress with a shocking pink drape around her waist. Now, both looks were quite similar, not only in terms of styling but in the aspect of being disappointing too. </p>

      <p>While Kareena Kapoor Khan's leather tube dress was quite sexy had she not decorated it with the leafy drape, Kriti did not score on her black dress as well. Even without the pink drape, it would have looked quite blah. </p>

      <p>So, here are the two cases of drape dress going wrong. We hope that Bollywood ladies take a cue from this and not repeat the blunder.<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- instagram/therealkareenakapoor/ afashionistasdiaries/ </i><i>kritisanon</i></p>
