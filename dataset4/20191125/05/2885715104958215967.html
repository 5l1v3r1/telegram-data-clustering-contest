      <h1>Sunil Gavaskar rebukes Virat Kohli, says India won Tests before Sourav Ganguly too</h1>
      <h2>"I know Dada is the BCCI President, so maybe Virat Kohli wanted to say nice things about him. But India were also winning in the '70s and '80s. He wasn't born then," said Sunil Gavaskar.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:17:41+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/sports-desk/" target="_blank">Sports Desk</a></address>
      <p>Sunil Gavaskar took exception to <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/virat-kohli/">Virat Kohli</a>’s comment that India began to stand up to tough Test challenges during <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sourav-ganguly/">Sourav Ganguly</a>’s era, saying that Team India had been winning even before the current captain was born.</p>
      <p>“The Indian captain (Kohli) said that this thing started in 2000 with Dada’s (Ganguly’s) team.”</p>
      <p>“I know Dada is the BCCI President, so maybe Kohli wanted to say nice things about him. But India were also winning in the ’70s and ’80s. He wasn’t born then,” Gavaskar said.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people still think that cricket started only in the 2000s. But the Indian team won overseas in the ’70s. The Indian team also won away in 1986. India also drew series overseas.”</p>
      <p>They lost as other teams did,” Gavaskar added. He was speaking on the post-match show on the broadcasting channel.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the presentation ceremony after India won the Kolkata Test against Bangladesh by an innings, Kohli said, “Test cricket is a mental battle. We’ve learnt to stand up – it all started from Dada’s (Sourav Ganguly) team. The belief is key and to be honest we’ve worked hard, and reaping the rewards of it.”</p>
