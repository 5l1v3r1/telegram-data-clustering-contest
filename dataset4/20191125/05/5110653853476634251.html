      <p>Anthony Joshua has promised an "incredible night" of boxing on Dec. 7 after arriving in Saudi Arabia ahead of his rematch against Andy Ruiz Jr.</p>
      <p>Joshua is aiming to reclaim the IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight titles after suffering a shock loss —the first of his professional career —at the hands of replacement opponent Ruiz last June.</p>

      <p>Having dropped his rival earlier in the round, the Briton was sensationally floored in the third. He was also knocked down twice in the seventh, leading to the contest being stopped.</p>
      <p>After their first bout was staged at the iconic Madison Square Garden in New York, the duo will meet again in Riyadh, with the determined challenger predicting an unforgettable fight as he bids to avenge the only blot on his boxing CV.</p>
      <p>"It's going to be an incredible night and I'm thrilled so many of my fans are going to be there, particularly from the United Kingdom," said Joshua.</p>
      <p>"It'll definitely be a night people will tell their grandchildren they were at, one of those iconic evenings of boxing. Everyone from Saudi has been brilliant to work with."</p>
