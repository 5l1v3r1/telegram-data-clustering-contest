      <h1>Sydney bracing for 90km/h winds, severe storms</h1>

      <p>The northern and western parts of Sydney are expected to be lashed by heavy thunderstorms and massive winds as the Bureau of Meteorology issued a severe weather warning on Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Hornsby and surrounding suburbs are set to be the heaviest hit, but meteorologist Katarina Kovacevic said that "later on this afternoon and into the evening, the storms could extend".</p>

      <p>"If you drew a line from Camden to the CBD, probably north of that line [is the area that will be affected]," she said.</p>
      <p>Hail fell in the north-west suburb of Galston in the afternoon and could spread further.</p>

      <p>"We could see wind gusts of up to 90km/h. That's strong enough to bring down trees and potentially powerlines," Ms Kovacevic said.</p>

      <p>While Sydney, the Central Coast and the Hunter prepare for a wet evening, the areas in NSW that need rain the most will be mostly unaffected.</p>
      <p>"We've got some storms that are currently going off in the north of the state, around Armidale for example, as well as near Moree," Ms Kovacevic said.</p>
      <p>"In terms of the rainfall, it's going to be associated with storms that are pretty hit-and-miss."</p>

      <p>She added that, in terms of mitigating drought, there were only one or two areas that might benefit from some rainfall but that it wasn't going to be enough.</p>

      <p>"Many, many months of below average rainfall aren't going to be offset by one or two days of storms."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the Rural Fire Service fears storms that brought rain to a number of firegrounds in northern NSW may end up worsening the bushfire crisis.</p>
      <p>RFS spokesman James Morris said the rain that fell over the weekend was too isolated and not sufficient to help put out the fires burning across large parts of the state's north, while a large number of lightning strikes might prove a ticking time bomb for when hot and windy weather returns.</p>
