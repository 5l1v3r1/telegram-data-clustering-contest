      <h1>'One or two disaffected people': Libs play down mooted Coe coup</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Jervis-Bardy, Daniella White</a></address>
      <p>A small group of "disaffected" Liberals is being blamed for plotting to potentially overthrow Opposition Leader Alistair Coe before next year's ACT election.</p>
      <p><i>The Canberra Times</i> understands up to four of the party's 11 MLAs have been open to removing Mr Coe as leader.</p>
      <p>Deputy Opposition Leader Nicole Lawder confirmed different "points of view" on the Liberal leadership were aired at a party room meeting on Monday morning, but insisted the opposition was now "united" behind Mr Coe.</p>
      <p>Ms Lawder was the only Liberal MLA to publicly address reports that some of her colleagues were canvassing the option of replacing Mr Coe as <a href="https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6507566/canberra-liberals-leadership-in-turmoil-as-doubts-cast-on-coe/?cs=14225">party leader - possibly with senior moderate Elizabeth Lee</a>.</p>
      <p>One Liberal source described the attempted coup as "amateurish".</p>
      <p>Ms Lee did not respond to calls from <i>The Canberra Times</i> asking to clarify her position. But she took to Twitter, saying she was committed to winning next year's election under Mr Coe's leadership.</p>
      <p>Despite those assurances, speculation about Mr Coe's leadership is likely to loom large over the year's final week of sittings in the ACT Legislative Assembly.</p>

      <p>Ms Lawder fronted reporters on Monday to discuss crime in Tuggeranong - but attention quickly turned to rumblings about her party's leadership.</p>
      <p>She described the speculation as a "storm in a tea cup", but acknowledged there were "one or two disaffected" people in the Liberal party room.</p>
      <p>Mr Coe did not comment on Monday, but he was understood to be buoyed by the level of support he received from colleagues since reports of the potential coup emerged.</p>
      <p>It was understood that Mr Coe wasn't surprised by the rumoured challenge, as he has been forced to contend with resistance from a small section of his party room since taking on the leadership in the wake of the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>Ms Lawder insisted the Liberals were united behind Mr Coe, even suggesting party unity would be strengthened by the leadership speculation.</p>
      <p>She maintained that the opposition could win next October's election with Mr Coe at the helm.</p>
      <p>Asked if the Liberals would be better placed to topple Labor with a more moderate leader in charge, Ms Lawder said: "If only I had a crystal ball ... I would be able to answer these questions."</p>
      <p>"This is what the party room has decided [to support Mr Coe] and this is the way forward," she said.</p>
      <p>"We're not looking back or contemplating our navels. We're looking forward, the election is less than 12 months away - that's entirely the whole team's focus."</p>

      <p>A senior party source said it was a "bit of a stretch" to suggest that disaffected MLAs were "doing the numbers" ahead of a serious challenge to Mr Coe's leadership.</p>
      <p>Instead, party members had simply been "having robust discussions about the best way forward", the source said.</p>
      <p>Outgoing ACT Labor secretary Matt Byrne said Ms Lee's failure to hose down the speculation until more than 24 hours after the story surfaced implied a change in leadership was being seriously considered within the party.</p>
      <p>"The Canberra Liberals have finally joined the rest of Canberra and realised having one of the most conservative politicians as leader is toxic for your vote," Mr Byrne said.</p>
      <p>"But I don't think it really matters who their leader is, it's controlled by the hard right."</p>
      <p>He disputed Ms Lee's credentials as a moderate, claiming she was a climate sceptic.</p>
      <p>"I think the only thing she's ever come out in favour of is marriage equality," Mr Byrne said.</p>
      <p>Rumblings about Mr Coe's leadership come as the <a href="https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6490278/migrant-leaders-put-hand-up-for-canberra-liberals-election-team/">Canberra Liberals prepare to preselect the remaining 15 candidates for their 2020 election team</a>.</p>
      <p>Aside from the retiring Vicki Dunne, all of the Liberals' sitting MLAs have already been endorsed to contest the October 2020 ballot.</p>
      <p>Branch members in each of the five electorates will meet this week to select non-incumbents, although contested ballots will only be needed for two seats - the Belconnen-based seat of Ginninderra and the electorate of Brindabella, in Canberra's south.</p>
