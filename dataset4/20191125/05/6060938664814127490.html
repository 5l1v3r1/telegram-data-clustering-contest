      <h1>Taapsee Pannu gives a befitting reply to an attendee who asked her to speak in Hindi at an event</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:41:34+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:41</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>The video of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Taapsee-Pannu">Taapsee Pannu</a> giving a befitting reply to an audience member, who tried to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/troll">troll</a> her for not speaking in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hindi">Hindi</a> at a recent event in Goa, is going viral on the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Internet">Internet</a> since yesterday.</p>
      <p>Taapsee Pannu was invited as a guest speaker at the event where she was interrupted by a person sitting in the audience who asked her to speak in Hindi as 'she is a Hindi film actress.'</p>
      <p>As soon as the attendee said this, Taapsee was quick to reply, "Sir, main to pura Hindi me baat karsakti hoon, par kya yahan sabko Hindi samajh aayegi?" (Sir, I can speak in Hindi for the entire session but will the audience understand Hindi?)</p>
      <p>She further went on to say, "Main <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/south-Indian">south Indian</a> actress bhi hoon... Tamil aur Telugu main bhi baat karu?" (I'm also a south Indian actress, so, should I speak in Tamil and Telugu too?)</p>
      <p>Taapsee was applauded for her response and reportedly the rest of the session went on without interruptions. Since yesterday #TappseeOnFire has been trending on <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Twitter">Twitter</a> for the actress' best reply to the attendee. " <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/forbes-list-aside-taapsee-pannu-is-confident-that-she-can-beat-akshay-kumar-at-this-race-2092851">You slay like a boss</a>," one fan commented, while another wrote, "#TaapseeOnFire! She sIayed a vicious troll who was trying to school her... Taapsee you are a staaaa (that's star but with an accent)."</p>

      <p>However, one of the users blamed the '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Saand-Ki-Aankh">Saand Ki Aankh</a>' actress for not speaking Hindi because it is not an 'elite language'. To which Taapsee replied, "Thinking and not language makes a person elite."</p>
