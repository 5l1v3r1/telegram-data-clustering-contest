      <p>"On December 5 we will be taking over Blossoms Liquor &amp; Grind for one spectacular night only. Expect live music and DJ sets from the best talent the region has to offer, alongside a truly unique shopping experience."</p>
      <p>The live music comes in the form of three top acts - former Unsigned column stars Alex Ohm and Bryony Williams, as well as Black Country Music Award winner Ryan Evans.</p>
      <p>All three will be playing material nerw and old - Ohm has a new single out soon and an EP planned for next year, while Evans has been busy promoting his latest single 21 Candles, a homage to Dudley's late, great Manchester United and England hero Duncan Edwards.</p>
      <p>And True Reverie continued: "Tickets are priced at a mere £5 and when you buy one, not only will it gain you admission to our incredible Christmas Carnival, but you will also be supporting the Good Shepherd Services as all profits from ticket sales will be donated directly to this Wolverhampton homelessness charity.</p>
      <p>"Enjoy a night out, support a local charity, discover amazing music, buy from local artists, support local businesses - Christmas shopping has never been so much fun."</p>
      <p>As well as the three singer-songwriters, there will also be DJ sets on the night from Right on DJ sets from: Stay Loose Records' Ian Davies and Stewart Kendrick from All Hands On Decks.</p>
      <p>And as well as True Reverie and Stay Loose Records, stalls on the night include, among others, author and designer Maisie Baker, illustrator Ruth Radcliffe and Black Country Type.</p>
      <p>Tickets are £5 in advance from <a href="https://www.ticketsource.co.uk/true-reverie/?fbclid=IwAR3htL6TZ4At-tU2gW0Y5TbJc_cc9wn1qiogSbtXKwGWl9KkVWu0fwwBe6A">TicketSource</a>, and for more information on the carnival see the dedicated <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2581581915232570/">Facebook event page</a>.</p>
