      <p>The move would help to address the diseases like diabetes, hypertension, kidney and cancer, which are the number one killer diseases in Tanzania and across the world.</p>
      <p>Head of Diabetic Clinic at Regency Medical Center, Dr Emmanuel Maganga, made the suggesting when speaking during the free diabetic camp organised by Regency Hospital and Baps Charities in Dar es Salaam.</p>
      <p>Maganga said: “It is sad to see that working force particularly youth between 30 years of age and 45 are the ones who suffer mostly with NCDs.”</p>
      <p>He suggested the need for the government and community to educate the people about the seriousness of the problem in the country.</p>
      <p>He said life style especially for the youth who prefer to eat food that contains a lot of fats and lack of regular exercises has caused the youth in the country to suffer diabetes mostly compared to elders.</p>
      <p>“People must understand that the moment you are announced diabetic there is a possibilities for your kidney to fail, you would suffer hypertension and eventually eye problems will start so it is better if we change our lifestyle to avoid this situation,” he said</p>
      <p>“People must be educated on importance of eating healthy food such as vegetables and fruits as well as doing regular exercises.”</p>
      <p>“It is bad to see that youth of productive age are the ones who are at risk of diabetes, because of lifestyles. This is a challenge that needs collective efforts, if we’re to make the public healthier,” he said.</p>
