      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a>’s mum was overcome with emotion when the Shake It Off hit-maker was honoured at the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/american-music-awards/">American Music Awards</a> on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Before the awards took place in Los Angeles at the Microsoft Theatre, it was revealed that Taylor would be honoured with the coveted award that named her the Artist of the Decade.</p>
      <p>She put on an epic performance that paid tribute to her career over the last 10 years and saw her perform a medley of a number of her hits, including the likes of Love Story, Blank Space and Shake It Off.</p>
      <p>But the moment that really got us feeling all the feels, was Taylor’s mum tearing up as her baby girl accepted her iconic prize.</p>
      <p>Taylor was awarded the Artist of the Decade gong by singer Carole King – who she revealed was one of her mum’s favourite artists and the artist that inspired her to pursue a career in music during her speech.</p>

      <p>Swifty’s parents were cheering her on from the audience and it all got a bit too much for Taylor’s mum, Andrea, who was seen wiping away tears from her eyes with a tissue.</p>
      <p>Taylor said: ‘I cannot believe it’s you Carole King who gave me this award. My parents are here tonight, they would listen to Tapestry and all your other records in high school… when they had my brother and I they played those records for us.</p>
      <p>‘When I fell in love with music it was around the time I realised how marvellous it was that artists could transcend so many different phases and changes in people’s lives. You taught me that that’s a possibility.</p>
      <p>‘All any of the artists, or anyone in this room, really wants is to create something that lasts. The fact that this is an award that celebrates a decade of hard work and art and fun and memories… all that matters to me is the memories that I have had with you guys, the fans, over the years.</p>

      <p>‘We’ve had fun, incredible, exhilarating, extraordinary times together and may it continue… I’m so lucky I get to do this.’</p>
      <p>Taylor’s appearance at the AMAs this year came after she seemed to reignite her feud with Scooter Braun, after he purchased Big Machine Label Group, who own Taylor’s entire back catalogue.</p>
      <p>She claimed that she wasn’t allowed to buy the masters of her work and recently accused Scooter of banning her from performing her old songs at the AMAs.</p>

      <p>Scooter denied this and it was later confirmed that Taylor had <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/taylor-swift-perform-old-songs-american-music-awards-reaching-deal-scooter-brauns-label-11178243/">reached a deal with Big Records to perform her old hits</a>, with the label stating: ‘It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media.’</p>

      <p>Taylor seemed to allude to the drama during her performance on stage as it kicked off with her wearing a white shirt with the titles of her past albums printed across it in prison font.</p>
      <p>She sang her track The Man which seems to highlight gender inequality, before ripping off the shirt and launching into a medley of her past hits.</p>
      <p>Taylor dominated the AMAs and scooped up a huge six wins on the night, including Artist of the Year, which saw her break the record for the most AMA wins of all time – she now totals 29.</p>
      <p>Michael Jackson previously held the record with 24 wins.</p>
