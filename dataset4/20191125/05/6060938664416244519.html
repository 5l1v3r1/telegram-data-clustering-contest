      <p>GLASGOW: Fast-rising Indian shuttler <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Lakshya-Sen">Lakshya Sen</a> claimed his fourth title in three months, bagging the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Scottish-Open">Scottish Open</a> title with a thrilling win over Brazil's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ygor-Coelho">Ygor Coelho</a> in the men's singles summit clash here.</p>
      <p>The top-seeded Indian overcame his Brazilian opponent 18-21, 21-18, 21-19 in a 56-minute final on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old from Uttarakhand has now clinched three titles out of the four tournaments that he has played since September -- SaarLorLux Open, Dutch Open, and Belgian International.</p>
      <p>After losing in the second round of Irish Open, Lakshya made amends this week and dished out some superb performances right from the start.</p>

      <p>The Indian began his campaign with a straight-game win over Austria's Luka Wraber, before defeating compatriot Kiran George to reach the quarterfinals.</p>
      <p>The world No. 41 Indian then recorded another straight-game win over sixth-seed Brian Yang before seeing off France's Christo Popov in the semifinals.</p>
      <p>After this win, Lakshya will break into the top-40 in the BWF rankings and inch closer to a direct qualification in the top grade 2 events.</p>
      <p>Lakshya thus joined fellow Indians Anand Pawar (2010 and 2012), Arvind Bhatt (2004) and Pullela Gopichand (1999) in winning the Scottish Open title.</p>
      <p>During the final, Lakshya had fallen behind in the opening game but he managed to turn the tables and grab a 10-8 lead. Coelho, however, reeled off six straight points to move to a 14-10 lead.</p>
      <p>The Indian kept breathing down his opponent's neck but Coelho ensured he had the bragging rights after the opening game.</p>
      <p>Stung by the reversal, Lakshya came out firing in the second game and jumped to a 7-0 lead. The Brazilian slowly clawed back to make it 17-17 but Lakshya managed to bounce back into the contest by levelling the match.</p>
      <p>The decider turned out to be an evenly-fought contest and both the shuttlers battled hard to gain the lead. Coelho enjoyed an 11-8 advantage at the break but a gritty Lakshya kept drawing parity and eventually had the last laugh.</p>
      <p>Lakshya will now play at the Syed Modi International Super 300 tournament at Lucknow starting Tuesday.</p>
