      <p>New Zealand spinner Mitchell Santner had a terrific outing in the first Test against England. He not only picked up three top-order wickets on day four to set up a deserved win for New Zealand, Santner also played a crucial knock with the bat.</p>
      <p>He scored his first Test century on day four during the record-breaking partnership with double-centurion BJ Watling and picked up three for 53 in Englandâ€™s second innings on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He capped off the match with a stunning catch at short-cover position to dismiss Ollie Pope on day five as England were bowled out for 197, <a href="https://scroll.in/field/944805/watling-wagner-star-as-new-zealand-fight-back-to-beat-england-by-an-innings-in-first-test">losing the match by an innings and 65 runs</a> at Mount Maunganui.</p>

      <p>Neil Wagner, who finished with a five-wicket haul, bowled a wide and low full-toss. Pope decided to throw his bat at it with no control over the shot.</p>
      <p>It flew to the right of Santner, who stretched full-length to pull-off an incredible one-handed catch.</p>
