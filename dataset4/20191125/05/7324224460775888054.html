      <p>Bernard Hill who appeared in blockbusters like Lord of the Rings and Titanic, is a lifelong Manchester United fan and asked to be involved in the production after being interviewed by Rose Cook-Monk, of the Duncan Edwards Foundation.</p>
      <p>The actor, who had his big break playing Yosser Hughes in Alan Bleasdale’s groundbreaking 80s’ TV series Boys From The Black Stuff, will play the character Time, essentially in the role of narrator.</p>
      <p>The tour will raise funds for The Duncan Edwards Foundation, launched in February last year, 60 years after the Munich air crash claimed Duncan's life, along with others of United's celebrated Busby Babes</p>
      <p>Rose, who founded the Foundation and wrote Keeping The Dream Alive, has also won plaudits for her 55-minute documentary And Then Came Munich which told the story of the 21-year-old footballing giant.</p>
      <p>The foundation provides grants and bursaries for young people in the Black Country with sporting ability who cannot afford training fees, kit or travelling expenses.</p>
      <p>The part of Edwards will be played by 21-year-old actor Zac Wadley from Sedgley.</p>
      <p>Rose said: "It's absolutely incredible that so many people are on the waiting list for tickets. We're really looking forward to the tour.</p>
      <p>"To have an actor like Bernard Hill on board is amazing. I didn't even have to ask him, he's such a massive Manchester United fan he asked me whether he could be part of it.</p>
      <p>"I told him I could never afford him but he was adamant and said something could be arranged. Obviously I accepted his kind offer.</p>
      <p>"At the same time it exciting to have a young actor like Zac on board, who apart from being a great actor also looks incredibly like Duncan."</p>
      <p>Hill will be at the premiere in Brierley Hill and all the other dates on the tour.</p>
