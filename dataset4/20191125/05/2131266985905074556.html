      <p>The beleaguered NZ Breakers hope they'll have the services of star import Scotty Hopson back in time for their clash with the Illawarra Hawks at Spark Arena on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The American hasn't played since he split a ligament in his knee during the win over the Cairns Taipans on October 31.</p>
      <p>Now back to full training, Hopson has his sights set on a return to the court this weekend.</p>
      <p>"The knee is great," said Hopson. "I've had a good couple of solid weeks of rehab, the team has done a great job, the staff have done a great job of helping me out, but I'm feeling good.  </p>

      </p>
      <p>"I've done what I have to do on my part to strengthen the leg and put myself in good condition, so I'm looking forward to a good week of practice, helping the guys out, so we get things going on the right track.  </p>
      <p>"I know I've missed them like they missed me."</p>
      <p>Given the team's on and off-court struggles - compounded by injury to Hopson's fellow backcourt gunner Corey Webster on Sunday - his return would be welcome news.</p>
      <p>Webster has been cleared of any fracture in his left ankle, but may still have damaged ligaments that would likely see him sidelined. </p>
      <p>Hopson was one of the Breakers' best through the early season, with per-game averages of 16.2 points and 6.6 assists in his debut campaign for the Auckland-based franchise.</p>
      <p>The Breakers have lost five straight games and are currently mired in eighth place on the competition ladder.</p>
