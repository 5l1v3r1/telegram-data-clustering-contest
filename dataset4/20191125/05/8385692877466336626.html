      <p>The Galaxy S11+ may differ from the Galaxy S11 and S11e, and be <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/samsung">Samsung</a>'s "nuclear weapon". This <a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1197858156002430978?s=09">information</a> comes from a well-known tipster, Ice Universe, who used quoted words exactly. In his tweet, he suggests that the S11+ may surprise us, though he did not really clarify what exactly that means.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy S11 and S11e already leaked recently. Both devices surfaced in CAD-based renders, with some additional information. We basically know what both phones will look like, along with some additional info.</p>
      <p>The only device that did not surface is the Galaxy S11+. You'd expect that the Galaxy S11+ will look like the Galaxy S11 and S11e, but be larger, right? Well, that may not be the case.</p>

      <h3>"Nuclear weapon" description suggests Samsung prepares significant changes for the Galaxy S11+</h3>
      <p>Ice Universe claims that the Galaxy S11+ will differ from its siblings, and be Samsung's "nuclear weapon", it seems. The tipster also added that the S11+ is not the same as the S11.</p>
      <p>He went further to clarify that the S11+ will not be as similar to the S11, as the Galaxy Note 10 is to the Galaxy Note 10+. He also listed the Galaxy S10 and S10+ as examples, suggesting that we're in for a treat with the Galaxy S11+.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, that is pretty much everything that the tipster shared. We can only suggest what he meant, as he did not clarify whether he's talking about the design, specs, or features. Maybe even all three.</p>

      <p>Let's assume that a different design will be a part of the equation. That only makes sense, as he really wanted us to know how different will it be. So, it may include even thinner bezels, or perhaps a different implementation of a display camera hole, if it ends up sporting one.</p>
      <p>It is even possible that the tipster was referring to the camera setup on the back. The Galaxy S11+ may offer some considerable advantages over the S11 and S11e, we'll have to wait and see.</p>
      <p>This has managed to peak our interest in the Galaxy S11+. @OnLeaks had already shared the S11 and S11e designs, along with some additional info, we're hoping that he'll do the same for the S11+, soon.</p>

      <h3>It will be larger than its siblings</h3>
      <p>The Galaxy S11+ will be larger than both the S11 and S11e, that much is certain. The Galaxy S11 will feature a 6.7-inch display, based on previously leaked info. The S11+, on the other hand, will probably ship with a 6.9-inch panel.</p>
      <p>The device will include the same processor(s) as the Galaxy S11, and S11e. It will be fueled by the Exynos 9830 in Europe and India, while the Snapdragon 865 will fuel it in the US and China.</p>
      <p>Android 10 will come pre-installed on the phone, with Samsung's custom UI. One UI 2 will probably come pre-installed on the device, unless Samsung ends up releasing another new version at some point.</p>
