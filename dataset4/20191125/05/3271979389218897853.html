      <p>Remember <b>Gwen Stefani</b> and <b>Blake Shelton</b>’s wedding in Reno, Nevada last year? No? That’s because it never happened, despite a tabloid story claiming otherwise. <b>Gossip Cop</b> debunked the phony article at the time, and one year later, our reporting has shown to be correct.</p>
      <p>On November 25, 2018, the <b><i>Globe</i></b> declared <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-married-wedding-reno/">Shelton “gave in” and eloped with Stefani in Reno</a>. According to the bogus story, the couple secretly “snatched up a marriage license and got hitched by a preacher in the privacy of their hotel room.” The tabloid quoted a so-called insider as saying, “It was the way they wanted it, a marriage ceremony for just the two of them.” Really? Exchanging vows in a hotel room in Reno was exactly “the way they wanted it”?</p>
      <p>Of course, nothing about the story was true, as we confirmed this time last year. The couple didn’t elope in Reno, or anywhere else for that matter. The magazine’s report was also very sketchy on details. As <b>Gossip Cop</b> pointed out, there was no date mentioned, only a vague “late October” reference. The outlet didn’t know the name of the hotel where this supposed wedding took place, and most suspiciously, it was the only publication in the world reporting on the nuptials of the wildly popular coaches on <i>The Voice</i>. <b>Gossip Cop</b> looked into the claim, researching the public records in Nevada, and unsurprisingly came up with nothing.</p>
      <p>In the 365 days since, there have been multiple interviews with the two singers talking about their relationship and the prospect of marriage. Note – they discuss the prospect of marriage, not a secret wedding in Reno. Certainly, if this article were true, they would be wearing wedding rings, or at the very least talking about being married. The whole story stunk then and time has not been kind to the outlet’s claim.</p>
      <p>As if it wasn’t silly enough that the tabloid published such an outrageously false report, the outlet has covered the couple multiple times in the past 12 months, with subjects like <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-lose-weight-truth/">Stefani demanding Shelton lose weight</a> and <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-adopting-orphan-girl/">Shelton and Stefani adopting an orphan</a>. Neither of those bogus articles mentioned the secret ceremony in Nevada. The latter story came just weeks after <b>Gossip Cop</b> busted the tabloid for its poor reporting on the supposed Reno wedding.</p>
      <p>In August, <b>Gossip Cop</b> debunked an article in the <i>Globe</i> claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-meat-lose-weight/">Stefani was forcing Shelton to give up meat to lose weight</a>. In that piece, the tabloid alleged the No Doubt singer was demanding her boyfriend lose 20 pounds and to do so, he had to give up carbs and meat. As <b>Gossip Cop</b> noted, Stefani had thrown a pizza party for Shelton, making him a carb-heavy pepperoni pizza for his birthday. The tabloid doesn’t have any insight into the couple’s diets, let alone their marriage plans.</p>
