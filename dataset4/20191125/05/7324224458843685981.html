      <h2>Fans of Birmingham's The Twang have waited a long time to hear the words "new album", and boy was it worth the wait.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/leigh-sanders/" target="_blank">Leigh Sanders</a></address>
      <p>Record number five, If Confronted Just Go Mad is the first full-length we've heard from the gang since 2014's exciting Neon Twang.</p>
      <p>Five years - five years - they've left their devotees waiting.</p>

      <p>And one soundbite from a spokesperson summed it up perfectly when they said: "It is a reminiscent throwback to times gone by and youthful love in the 1990s."</p>
      <p>It definitely does have that feel of yesteryear. The summery, reminiscent guitars; Phil Etheridge's softly delivered vocals; Ash Sheehan's hopeful and positive-thinking drumming.</p>
      <p>Nearly everything here shouts of summertime beer garden slurps, happy times shared with friends full of laughter.</p>
      <p>It Feels Like (You're Wasting My Time) might not sound like what we described above, but wait for those jangling care-free guitars from Stu Hartland. It's a breezy, flighty romp through these guys' back catalogue.</p>
      <p>The almost-Springsteen-esque Tinseltown In The Rain might hold a little more atmospherics deep in its soul, but there's something still open armed and welcoming about how the versus weave together before a piano-led chorus opens up to hold court.</p>
      <p>One of the best recent additions to The Twang is the backing vocals from Cat Mctigue - most notably in opening number Everytime. She bounces off Etheridge as their deliveries wrestle to and fro, and the dualling guitars in the interlude sound more than a little like that reverberating refrain throughout Stardust's dance anthem Music Sounds Better With You.</p>

      <p>There's a disgustingly likeable swagger to the scratching and abrasive Dream. Here, there's all sorts being thrown into the mixing bowl, including the kind of wah-wah guitars that city mates Ocean Colour Scene would be proud of. Again, Mctigue and Etheridge combine to great effect.</p>
      <p>The electronic atmospherics in Izal showcase the other vocal addition - Rio Hellyer. Compressed, lo-fi dance vibes accompany the breezy lyrics throughout, waiting for the guitars to step in and carry the track onwards.</p>
      <p>Pick it up and have a gander. There's something you'll notice differently on each listen. It's possibly one to listen through twice before making a decision, but give it the time to fester in your mind and you'll beam from ear to ear.</p>
