      <h1>Are Australian banks facing a new great crisis?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:58:51+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/tmfdelboy/" target="_blank">Tom Richardson</a></address>
      <p><b>Westpac Banking Corp</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Westpac+Banking+Corp/?ticker=ASX-WBC">(ASX: WBC)</a> shares are now down 15% over just the last month as the bank faces a perfect storm of disappointing earnings numbers and diabolical publicity. </p>
      <p>The first wave of bad news came on November 4 when the bank revealed a weaker-than-expected cash profit of $6,849 million. That was down 15% on the prior fiscal year.</p>
      <p>The dividend also fell 15%, with the bank’s net interest margin and return on equity also falling.</p>
      <p>Westpac also announced a $2.5 billion cash call in order to bolster its capital adequacy reserve ratio. Any capital raising is of course dilutive to earnings per share going forward.</p>
      <p>On November 5 Westpac sold 79 million new shares to institutional investors at $25.32 per share.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately many of those institutional investors are upset with the shares now trading at $24.44 on the back of a regulatory compliance scandal.</p>
      <p>On November 20 Westpac admitted AUSTRAC has launched proceedings against it for up to 23 million breaches of its financial transaction reporting requirements.</p>
      <p>Already business commentators are speculating that Westpac may face the biggest fine in Australian corporate history as a result of its compliance failings.</p>
      <p>It’s a wonder then that share price hasn’t fallen any further.</p>
      <h3>Is it crisis time for Westpac?</h3>
      <p>As an aside on October 30 (just before Westpac unravelled) I enjoyed lunch with David Morgan the ex-Westpac CEO and a number of other heavy hitters in Australian finance.</p>
      <p>At the time I commented how bearish Mr. Morgan seemed on the outlook for Australian banks.</p>
      <p>Mr. Morgan even stated he believed Australian banks were facing their “fourth great crisis” due to the regulatory pressure being exerted.</p>
      <p>The first three ‘great crises’ being deregulation and the arrival of overseas competitors in the mid 1980’s, the early 1990’s recession, and the GFC.</p>
      <p>At the time Mr. Morgan’s comments struck me as over-the-top, but I suppose you shouldn’t doubt someone as well connected as Mr Morgan.</p>
      <p>Given Mr Morgan’s views have proven on the money so far, tomorrow (time permitting) I’ll write up some of the other views he offered on Australian bank shares.</p>
