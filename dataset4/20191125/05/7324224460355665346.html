      <p>Kesha made a triumphant return to the American Music Awards following a six-year absence.</p>

      <p>In a nod to Kanye West’s gospel-inspired weekend shows, Kesha told the audience “welcome to our Sunday service”.</p>
      <p>However, it was the raucous rendition of 2009 hit Tik Tok that sent fans inside Los Angeles’s Microsoft Theater into a state of frenzied excitement.</p>
      <p>Rapper Post Malone, nominated for seven AMAs, was among those dancing in the audience while the actor Taran Killam was captured looking stunned by Kesha’s performance.</p>

      <p>Fans reacted on Twitter, with one declaring the song contained “so much nostalgia in one performance”.</p>
      <p>Kesha’s appearance comes after a long-running legal battle with the music producer Dr Luke forced her to put her career on hold.</p>
      <p>Kesha, 32, accused Dr Luke of abusing her “to the point where (she) nearly lost her life”. He denies the allegations.</p>
      <p>Kesha is now preparing for the January release of her album High Road.</p>
