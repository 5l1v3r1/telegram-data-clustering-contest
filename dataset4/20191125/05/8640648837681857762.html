      <h1>LETTER: Las Vegas teachers union wants another $1 billion</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Trexler, Las Vegas</a></address>
      <p>Every year, the Clark County Education Association dreams up ways to get more tax dollars. But this new $1 billion tax proposal is out-of-the-question crazy (Wednesday Review-Journal). Consider that all the revenue from this new tax would go toward increased pay for teachers and staff through arbitration.</p>
      <p>The new tax would have to come from somewhere, but the union doesnâ€™t know where. But the union believes there are revenue streams that can be increased to generate more than $1 billion a year for education.</p>
      <p>This taxpayer will object to any initiative to add more taxes to my budget. My Social Security will increase by 1.6 percent next year, while I must pay a 7 percent increase for Medicare. I cannot see where the population can support any new taxes or increases to old taxes. The taxpayers are being taxed out as it is.</p>
