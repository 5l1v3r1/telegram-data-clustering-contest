      <p>GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Fatigue set in for the Edmonton Oilers in the second game of a back-to-back as part of a five-game road trip.</p>
      <p>However. the Oilers found a way to tie the score late in the third period and pick up two more key points with a shootout win.</p>
      <p>Connor McDavid got the only goal of the tiebreaker, and the Pacific Division-leading Oilers beat the second-place Coyotes 4-3 Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Mikko Koskinen stopped Vinnie Hinostroza on Arizona's last shootout attempt and finished with 27 saves. The Oilers got even for an overtime loss to Arizona at home earlier this month.</p>
      <p>"This is a really big road trip for us," Koskinen said. "We're never giving up, and when you believe in each other good things start to happen."</p>
      <p>James Neal, Alex Chiasson and Markus Granlund scored in regulation time for the Oilers, who have won three of four on their current road trip.</p>
      <p>Hinostroza, Carl Soderberg and Christian Fischer scored for Arizona, which was also playing the second game of a back-to-back. Alex Goligoski had three assists and Darcy Kuemper stopped 34 shots.</p>
      <p>Granlund tied the score at 3 when he collected a dropped catch from Kuemper of his own shot, and put in the rebound with 6:48 to play in regulation.</p>
      <p>"That goal, you've got to take the body, can't watch the puck," Coyotes coach Rick Tocchet said. "I thought we were doing well."</p>
      <p>The Oilers were more active around the net over the final minutes of the third period and overtime, but couldn't get another goal.</p>
      <p>McDavid extended his point streak to 11 games with his 29th assist of the season, while Leon Draisatl got his NHL-leading 32nd.</p>
      <p>The league’s second-best power play entering the game struck quickly. After a too many men on the ice penalty against Arizona, McDavid slid a pass across the Coyotes zone to Draisatl, who found Neal alone near the goal for a tap-in at 2:05 of the first period. It was Neal’s 14th of the season and gave him 21 points and 12 career goals against the Coyotes.</p>
      <p>Arizona tied it at 9:43 of the period, with 4 seconds left on a power play. Nick Schmaltz sent a pass to Soderberg, whose long wrist shot zoomed past Koskinen for his seventh goal of the season.</p>
      <p>Arizona had a chance to go in front before the first period ended, but Michael Grabner just missed a chance when Koskinen pushed the puck off the post just as it was about to get past him.</p>
      <p>Edmonton scored another quick goal to start the second period, Chiasson putting in a pass from Sam Gagner from behind the net.</p>
      <p>Gagner replaced injured second-line center Ryan Nugent-Hopkins after being scratched the previous three games.</p>
      <p>"(Gagner) comes in and gives us a lot of energy. That's what you need in this league, for guys to step up at different times," Chiasson said.</p>
      <p>Arizona tied it at 2 on Fischer’s goal off a pass from Grabner behind the net at 11:52. Fischer wriggled away from being tangled up with McDavid along the boards and skated back into the play to collect the pass and score.</p>
      <p>"That's a team we're chasing, and to give them a point when we have control, it stinks," Fischer said.</p>
      <p>Less than two minutes later, Hinostroza scored on a slap shot from the side that appeared to take a deflection in front of the net. Goligoski got his third assist of the game on the play.</p>
      <p>"We didn't have much gas in the tank, you could tell," Oilers coach Dave Tippett said. "Tough turnaround, so I'm proud of my guys for hanging around. It's a good two days for us."</p>
      <p>NOTES: The game marked the return of former longtime Coyotes-now-Oilers head coach Dave Tippett to Arizona. The Coyotes parted ways with Tippett after the 2016-2017 season, and after serving as am adviser for the NHL expansion team coming to Seattle, he was hired by Oilers. The Coyotes played a video tribute to Tippett, who waved in appreciation. ... Oilers F Jujhar Khaira was scratched for the second straight game after hurting his hand blocking a shot against the Los Angeles Kings Thursday. Nugent-Hopkins (hand injury) was scratched just before the game, missing his first game of the season, and is expected to miss at least one more. ... Coyotes F Lawson Crouse was scratched after suffering a head injury Saturday night at Los Angeles.</p>
