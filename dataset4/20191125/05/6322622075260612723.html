      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 25): CIMB Bank Bhd and Sun Life Malaysia have teamed up to offer customers access to global healthcare through a new product called Sun Prestige Health (SPH).</p>
      <p>CIMB Group's consumer banking chief executive officer (CEO) Samir Gupta said the non-participating universal life plan is aimed at meeting customers’ need for specialised medical expertise that may not be available in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>“This plan is designed for global coverage for customers; they can go to any hospital anywhere in the world to get the best possible treatment,” he told reporters after the SPH launch here today.</p>
      <p>CIMB Bank and Sun Life will continue to leverage on each other's strengths and expertise, enabling them to consistently offer innovative products to meet their customers’ varied needs.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Sun Life Malaysia CEO/president Raymond Lew described SPH as the latest in a long list of unique and tailor-made protection solution in the company’s ongoing efforts to provide consumers with lifetime financial security.</p>
      <p>“The customers will be provided with full concierge services so that they have peace of mind and most importantly to stay focused on their treatment and recuperation,” he added.</p>
      <p>Customers will be covered up to RM16 million with access to world-leading medical treatment for selected covered conditions or procedures.</p>
      <p>SPH also offers high coverage for death, permanent disability as well as benefits for critical illness from early to the advanced stage.</p>
