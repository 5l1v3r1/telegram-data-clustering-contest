      <p>SEOUL, Nov 25 — The Seoul Police Department has concluded there is no foul play in the death of K-pop star Goo Hara.</p>
      <p>The former member of girl group Kara was found dead at her home in Seoul yesterday. She was 28.</p>
      <p>During a press conference today, the police confirmed that Goo was last seen arriving home alone after midnight yesterday and a check of CCTV cameras showed no one visited her after that.</p>
      <p>“After an on-site investigation and testimonies from family and friends, it seems that there are no criminal charges currently,” a spokesman has been quoted as saying by various news outlets, including entertainment site <i>Koreaboo.com</i></p>
      <p>“CCTV shows that Goo arrived home at 12:35am on the 24th. Her time of death is estimated to be after that.”</p>
      <p>Proecutors will decide whether to proceed with an autopsy once they have examined the on-site investigation report together with her family, he continued.</p>
      <p>The police also revealed today that Goo’s body was found by her housekeeper last evening.</p>
      <p>The housekeeper, whom the police have not named, is known to have been close to Goo and decided to check on her when efforts to reach her failed.</p>
      <p>“The housekeeper found Goo Hara passed away at her house on November 24 around 6pm KST,” the spokesman added.</p>
      <p>The police confirmed earlier reports that a handwritten note was found in Goo’s house after her death.</p>
      <p>“A pessimistic note about her life written in Hara’s handwriting was discovered on the table in the living room,” he said.</p>
      <p>In May, Goo was hospitalised after a failed suicide attempt, following a public row with a former boyfriend, hairdresser Choi Jong-bum.</p>
      <p>Her death comes a month after Sulli — another K-pop star and Goo’s close friend — took her own life after a long struggle with online bullying.</p>
