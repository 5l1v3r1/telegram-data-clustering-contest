      <h1>Chandigarh proposes dedicated corridor for ambulances</h1>
      <h2>The situation is worse for those being referred from Panchkula civil hospital as the ambulance has to take the entire route from Madhya Marg to PGIMER and the same gets stuck.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:14:17+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/hina-rohtaki/" target="_blank">Hina Rohtaki</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a> urban planning department has mooted a dedicated corridor for ambulances in the city, connecting peripheral areas.</p>
      <p>The department has made this proposal after the issue was raised several times at meetings of the Road Safety Council.</p>
      <p>A senior officer of the planning department said, “To have a dedicated corridor for ambulances, we are studying traffic volumes along major city roads which connect the Tricity, like the Madhya Marg and other routes. Only after the traffic study, will we be able to draw the complete picture and send it to the engineering wing.”</p>
      <p>One issue that is acting as a hindrance in having a dedicated lane purely on the Madhya Marg is paucity of space.</p>
      <p>“The area is already choked due to traffic. We may try and give connectivity to the internal lanes running across the Madhya Marg, the way connecting the cycle tracks have been given,” the officer added.</p>
      <p>There have been instances when ambulances have remained stuck in traffic jams, particularly on the routes from Zirakpur, Hallomajra, Madhya Marg and other points. It leads to loss of “golden hour” when patients are rushed to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research(PGIMER) or other hospitals like the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, and the Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, Chandigarh.</p>
      <p>The situation is worse for those being referred from Panchkula civil hospital as the ambulance has to take the entire route from Madhya Marg to PGIMER and the same gets stuck.</p>
      <p>Officials in the urban planning department stated that the demand for having a dedicated corridor for ambulances came from PGIMER, following which they have been asked to work over it. Once a dedicated lane is made, ambulances need not get stuck in traffic jams.</p>
      <p>The plan will be placed before the next Road Safety Council meeting that is chaired by the UT Adviser.</p>
      <p>Already only for ambulance movement, the UT traffic police has tried restricting the movement of vehicles, except two-wheelers, on the service road between the Zirakpur barrier and the Hallo Majra light point.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lay-bys</b>
      </p>
      <p>The department of urban planning is also working on the provision of having lay-bys on V1, V2, V3 and other major city roads where auto-rickshaws and buses can pull back from the normal flow of traffic and stop for a short time.</p>
      <p>In foreign countries, lay-bys are made mostly near pedestrian pathways so that public vehicles may pick or drop passengers at a distance from the normal traffic lane.</p>
      <p>The proposal had come from the transport department that had suggested that the lay-bys be carved out near bus queue shelters on the city’s major roads, depending upon the space available. There have been many cases where these auto-rickshaw drivers stop all of a sudden in the moving traffic that causes accidents.</p>
      <p>The urban planning department has already suggested that there should be a restriction on stopping or parking of vehicles within 75 m of an intersection or within 10 m of bus stops.</p>
