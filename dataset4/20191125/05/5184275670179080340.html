      <p>Last week, the makers of Kartik Aaryan, Ananya Panday and Bhumi Pednekar’s <i>Pati Patni Aur Woh</i> released a new song, Ankiyon Se Goli Maare. The song is a recreation of Govinda &amp; Raveena Tandon’s hit track from the movie Dulhe Raja. However, the viewers weren’t happy about the recreation and expressed their views online, but what one wants to know is the original actor’s reaction to it.</p>
      <p>A lot of social media users expressed their disappointment, saying that the song was low on energy and didn’t match the level that Raveena Tandon and Govinda created in the original. Now, if recent reports are to be believed, Govinda isn’t happy with the Ankiyon Se Goli Maare recreation either but is maintaining his silence in order to not pay more attention to the song.</p>

      <p>A source close to Deccan Herald revealed the same as, “Govinda is not flattered. Far from it, Kartik, Bhumi and Ananya seem clueless about the pace and rhythm of the song.”</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the report suggests that Govinda and Raveena would rather not give more heat to the song that it’s already receiving and that’s the reason they’re refraining from making a statement about it publically.</p>
      <p>Ankhiyon Se Goli Maare has been recreated by composer Tanishk Bagchi and sung by Mika Singh and Tulsi Kumar. It is choreographed by Farah Khan.</p>
      <p>Talking about the song, Tulsi said: “We have all grown up listening to these peppy numbers which just remind you of so many things and memories. I have grown up to the 90’s music getting an opportunity be a part of this iconic Govinda – Raveena Tandon number Is a dream come true.</p>
      <p><i>Pati Patni Aur Woh</i> is an adaptation of B.R. Chopra’s 1978 film with the same title.</p>
      <p>The film is slated to release on December 6, 2019.</p>
