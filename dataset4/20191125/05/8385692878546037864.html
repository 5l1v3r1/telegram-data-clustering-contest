      <p>Black Friday is coming early for the <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">Sony PlayStation 4 Pro</a>. Today, over at Amazon, you can save $100 off of its regular price. Getting the console for just $299.</p>
      <p>Now, unfortunately, unlike the PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 4 Slim, you aren't getting any games included here. It's just the console and an extra controller. But, you can save big on plenty of games right now. There are a number of PlayStation 4 hits on sale over at Best Buy, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/334843/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpromo%2Fcw-save-on-top-titles">starting at $10</a>.</p>
      <p>The PlayStation 4 Pro is the high-end console from Sony right now. The biggest difference between it and the regular PlayStation 4 is 4K. With the PlayStation 4 Pro, you're going to be able to game in 4K HDR, as well as watch content from Netflix and others in that same 4K HDR. Which makes for a really big difference, if you have the right TV.</p>

      <p>If you have a TV that supports both 4K and HDR, then the PlayStation 4 Pro is definitely the console to get. Playing a game like Rocket League in 4K HDR versus 1080p is a really big difference, and you'll be glad you spent the extra $100 on the PlayStation 4 Pro.</p>
      <p>Of course, with the PlayStation 4 Pro, you're going to want to get some games. And there are plenty of great games available for the PlayStation 4 Pro right now. As we already mentioned, Rocket League is a great one to pick up. And it's usually around $10-$15 anyways. There's also God of War, The Last of Us, and much more available.</p>
      <p>The PlayStation 4 Pro is good for more than just playing games though. It can be your streaming set top box. With many apps available including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, YouTube and much more. So you won't need to spend money on an Android TV box or even a Roku this year.</p>
