      <p>Though Kiara Advani made her Bollywood debut with <i>Fugly,</i> it was her appearance in Sushant Singh Rajput’s <i>M.S Dhoni: The Untold Story</i> that catapulted her into a household name. And now, it is in her recent interview that Kiara has revealed that it was the producer of her debut film, Akshay Kumar, who has mentored her right through her journey.</p>
      <p>Kiara further revealed that when she was battling depression, it was indeed Khiladi Kumar who helped her come back in shape. Speaking to Pinkvilla, Kiara revealed, “A lot of people think Dhoni was my first film but it was <i>Fugly</i> that came a year before Dhoni. I did not become an overnight sensation or anything. People dint know me, I was still auditioning and all of that was still happening. That was the lowest point in my career where I thought, Will I even get a second chance? What will happen to my career? Will I get another opportunity? I know people think that I know Salman sir and so and so, it must be easy. It wasn’t.”</p>
