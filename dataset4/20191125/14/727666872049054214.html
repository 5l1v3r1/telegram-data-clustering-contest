      <h1>What Does Jay-Z Have In Store For Mach Hommy?</h1>

      <p>What are Jay-Z and Mach Hommy working on?</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop Rumors)</b> Did you peep this? Mach Hommy is one of the kings of the New York underground! Well, he and Jay are up to something. "What?" is the big question! Griselda Records got down with Jay-Z earlier in the year to really solidify Jigga's commitment to domination - commercially and underground. And, Mach Hommy isn't even as well known as Westside, Benny and Conway, but he's definitely impacting the game. Jay-Z's interest is interesting to me. He's also from Newark, NJ and not NY, which is interesting. Time will tell, but Mach Hommy is one unique dude. We don't even know what he looks like!</p>
      <p>Here is some random stuff that didn't make it over the week, because of random system issues.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop Rumors) </b>OK...this is going to be a lot so let's just <i>PLOW THROUGH THESE RUMORS AND NOT SO RUMORS!</i></p>
      <p>I don't know how Ciara and Megan Thee Stallion are having a twerk off even in good fun! Megan is a professional twerker and Ciara is a dancer! Now a dancer can twerk and a twerker can dance, but a twerker and never be bested by a dancer in twerking. PERIOD!</p>
      <p>Check them out!</p>
      <p>Let us take it to the old school. "They" are saying that Bobby Brown did not sing "Every Little Step," one of his hit records from back in the day. Ralph Tresvant though? A website failed to offer any real proof, yet made these sensational allegations. I have been told that they likely altered Bobby's rugged voiced slightly to make it "softer" and more palatable to the masses. I gotta say, this is POPPYCOCK! But take a listen!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ray J...Is Having A Bad, BAD Look!</b>
      </p>
      <p>I am NOT about to write a bunch of stuff about Ray J, but this brother's life is going haywire right now!</p>
      <blockquote>My heart has been heavy for the last past week. I miss my baby Melody so much it hurts! Iâ€™m so sorry the world has to watch a young relationship like ours fall down. In order to be solid in a relationship you have to keep people out of it and let God work it out. But this hasnâ€™t been the case. I will continue being the best man and father I can be no matter whatâ€™s on the other side. Without respect there is nothing. Love took a L this time. ðŸ’”</blockquote>
      <p>Now, Ray J has apparently blocked his pregnant WIFE from the Gram? How do you leave them in Vegas and also block the DM? Well, I am not judging. I am just asking questions! Damn B! They have such a beautiful family!</p>
      <p>As a matter of record, Ray J denies the allegations of abandonment. "To insinuate that I would do anything to harm my daughter is just sad man." - Ray J! His pregnant wife-to-be is allegedly OVER it. This saga will continue to play out since she's giving us a play by play.Â </p>
