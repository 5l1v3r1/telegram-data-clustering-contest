      <h1>Google’s new ‘My Storytime’ platform helps families stay in touch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:00:59+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shereesa Moodley</a></address>
      <p>Google has launched a new platform called My Storytime, which aims to keep families in touch with pre-recorded audio via Google Assistant.</p>
      <p>According to the company, the tool allows users to create and share audio recordings, such as bedtime stories, that others can playback using Google Nest.</p>
      <p>“All your recordings are saved securely on the cloud. Only you and those you share them with will be able to access them,” Google explained on <a href="https://mystorytime.com/">My Storytime’s website</a>.</p>
      <p>Once a story is uploaded onto the platform, users can ask the Assistant to play them by saying “Hey Google, talk to My Storytime”.</p>
      <p>Essentially, My Storytime gives families a platform to stay in touch when they can’t in real-time.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Google Assistant now features the ability to <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/11/google-assistant-latest-news-united-states/">read out the news</a> and <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/11/google-assistant-movie-tickets/">buy movie tickets</a> for users in the United States.</p>
