      <p>Every retailer under the sun seemed to launch their Black Friday bargains last week, but what about Game - the only high street retailer that seems to give a damn about video games? Its Black Friday subsite was suspiciously dead last week, <a href="https://www.game.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/HubArticleView?hubId=268755&amp;articleId=268755&amp;catalogId=10201&amp;langId=44&amp;storeId=10151">but today things have changed a bit.</a></p>
      <p>Those deals have gone live today, and Game has promised that there will be new offers being added to its site every single day. In other words, it might be the right time to try and save yourself money on a new Nintendo Switch, PS4, or some other things game sells. Does Game still sell Pop Vinyls?
