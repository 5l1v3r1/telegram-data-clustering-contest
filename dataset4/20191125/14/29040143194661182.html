This is the holiday price, so you can find the deal at several other retailers like <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/159229/612734/9383?sharedid=1943169&amp;subId1=UUacUdUnU82803YYw&amp;subId2=thrifter&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-4-Pro-1TB-Gaming-Console-Wireless-Game-Pad-Black%2F741505081%3Fmnsid%3Dthrifter">Walmart</a> and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/159229/81938/2092?subId1=UUacUdUnU82803YYw&amp;subId2=thrifter&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-4-pro-1tb-console%2F-%2FA-51610033%3Fmnsid%3Dthrifter">Target</a>.</p>
