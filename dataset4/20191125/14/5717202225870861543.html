      <h1>Report: Eddie Howe may be more open to Everton approach</h1>

      </p>
      <p>It appears that Marco Silva’s days at Goodison Park could be numbered. Sky Sports reports that the Toffees are considering replacing the Portuguese before they face Leicester City this weekend.</p>

      <p>The report suggests that Everton could make a move to bring David Moyes back. But it is also suggested that Howe is on their radar.</p>

However, he was reluctant to leave Bournemouth and the Toffees appointed Ronald Koeman.</p>

      <p>But the report is now claiming that Howe is thought to be more open to the idea of taking over from Silva. The Cherries have won one game since September, and it is hinted that that run may prove to be a factor in Howe’s thinking.</p>
      <p>Bournemouth’s recent run certainly does hint that Howe may have taken the club as far as he can. They are now in their fifth season in the top flight and have not finished in the top-half since 2016/17.</p>
      <p>They are just three points off fifth. But their form may hint that they are going to have to do extremely well to finish in the top-half this season.</p>
      <p>Everton, of course, are several places lower in the table. But you could understand Howe’s thinking if he felt that there is greater potential on Merseyside.</p>
      <p>It will be interesting to see how Howe responds if Everton do come calling. This latest report suggests that he will have plenty of thinking to do.</p>
