      <h1>Tekashi 6ix9ine's Houston Mall Assault Case Reportedly Dismissed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:10:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/Kyle%20Eustice" target="_blank">Kyle Eustice</a></address>
      <p>Houston, TX – As <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53099/title.tekashi-6ix9ine-reportedly-getting-10m-for-2-new-albums">Tekashi 6ix9ine</a> continues to sit behind the bars of a New York jail, one of his cases has reportedly been dismissed.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/25/tekashi-6ix9ine-houston-mall-assault-case-dismissed/">TMZ, </a>The State of Texas formally requested 6ix9ine’s 2018 Houston assault case be thrown out and subsequently, a judge signed off on it on Monday (November 25).</p>
      <p>The alleged victim, Santigo Albarran, claims the “GUMMO” mastermind attacked him at the Galleria Mall last year. However, Albarran <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.48889/title.tekashi-6ix9ines-alleged-assault-victim-drops-case">dropped the charges</a> in October 2018. At the court hearing, Albarran and 6ix9ine posed for a photograph, making it clear the incident was water under the bridge.</p>

      <p>But there’s another reason a judge decided to dismiss the case. Due to 6ix9ine’s pending racketeering case, prosecutors believe transferring the controversial rapper to Texas is a “security risk,” especially since he became the <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53036/title.tekashi-6ix9ines-testimony-helps-convict-ex-fellow-gang-members">government’s star witness</a> during the trial.</p>
      <p><a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53180/title.mel-murda-sentenced-in-tekashi-6ix9ine-nine-trey-blood-case">6ix9ine</a> is expected to be sentenced on December 18. Due to his cooperation, it’s possible he won’t receive any additional jail time.</p>

      <p><a href="http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.48625/title.tekashi-6ix9ines-brooklyn-home-raided-by-fbi">Tekashi 6ix9ine </a>was all smiles leaving a Houston courthouse on Thursday (October 18). Santiago Albarran, the 16-year-old who accused 6ix9ine of <a href="http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.47623/title.tekashi-6ix9ine-arrested-for-outstanding-warrant-for-allegedly-choking-teen">attacking him at the Galleria Mall,</a> showed up at court to essentially drop the pending assault charges.</p>
      <p>During the proceedings, Albarran reportedly made it clear he didn’t want to prosecute the polarizing rapper.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2018/10/19/tekashi69-alleged-mall-attack-victim-does-not-want-prosecuted-court-houston/">TMZ,</a> Albarran told 6ix9ine’s attorney Carl Moore he wasn’t interested in going through with the charges and let prosecutors know that as well.</p>
      <p>Afterward, the Brooklyn native and Albarran ran into each other in the hallway where they posed for a picture.</p>
      <p>A judge issued a<a href="http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.46874/title.warrant-reportedly-issued-for-6ix9ine-over-fan-choking-claims"> warrant for 6ix9ine back in May </a>following the alleged assault. 6ix9ine was apprehended at the John F. Kennedy International Airport two months later. </p>
