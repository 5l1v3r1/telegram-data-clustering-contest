      <h1>Paul Finebaum Thinks There Is “Bias Against Alabama” This Year For The Playoff</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:26:44+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Alabama can’t win the SEC West and can’t play in the league’s title game, but the Crimson Tide are still very much alive for a potential College Football Playoff berth. ESPN’s Paul Finebaum thinks there is some “bias” against Alabama and the idea of them sneaking into the event.</p>
      <p>Finebaum joined WJOX 94.5 on Monday morning to talk about the Iron Bowl. During the segment, he noted that he thinks Alabama is in “great shape” for the playoff – arguing that people who have the Crimson Tide ranked No. 7 or No. 8 are biased.</p>
      <p>Here’s what Finebaum had to say about the idea of Alabama getting in:</p>
      <p>“In my mind, they are in great shape. Now again, you have to be careful here because there is a tremendous amount of bias against Alabama by people in the media. Yeah, I said it.</p>
      <p>You read various columns and some people have Alabama No. 7 or No. 8, No. 6 – right now, I don’t know how you can objectively say that. To me, Alabama looks like one of the four or five best teams in the country. You start doing comparison tests. Somebody this morning put Oklahoma ahead of them – I mean are you out of your mind? Oklahoma is not better than Alabama.”</p>

      <p>We’ll know a lot more after we see how Alabama performs with Mac Jones at quarterback against rival Auburn on the road. If the Crimson Tide dominates, it could be enough for the selection committee to put them in.</p>
      <p>This year’s Iron Bowl will kick off at 3:30 PM ET on CBS.</p>
