      <p>Living near a busy street or road can significantly increase the risk of developing lung cancer – and impede lung growth in children, a new study says.</p>
      <p>Research by a team at King’s College London shows that people living within 165 feet (50 meters) of busy roads in London were 9.7% more likely to develop lung cancer than people who lived on less heavily traveled streets in the UK capital.</p>
      <p>The primary cause of the elevated cancer risk factor for those living near high-traffic streets is said to be PM2.5, a small particle released into the air by fossil fuel-burning vehicles which can damage DNA in lung cells if inhaled.</p>
      <p>The study also found that living close to busy streets or roads impeded lung growth in children.</p>
      <p>By comparing children ages 11 to 15 who lived in busy streets, compared to quieter roads, researchers found that living close to heavily-used traffic arteries slows lung growth in children by 12.5%.</p>
