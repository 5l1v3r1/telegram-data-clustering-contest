      <h1>Bristol Rovers coach in the running for Grimsby Town managerial role</h1>
      <h2>He is one of the bookies' favourites</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:10:55+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:10</time> by <a rel="author">David Byrom</a></address>
      <p>Bristol Rovers coach Chris Hargreaves is one of the bookies' favourites for the Grimsby Town job.</p>
      <p>The Mariners are on the lookout for a new manager after parting company with Michael Jolley earlier this month, and the <a href="https://www.thesackrace.com/teams/grimsby-town">Sack Race</a> lists Hargreaves as fourth favourite for the role at 12/1.</p>
      <p>After joining the club in 2016 as under-23s manager, Hargreaves had a brief stint as <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Rovers</a> assistant under Graham Coughlan in the second half of last season, but a staff reshuffle in the summer saw him become academy manager.</p>

      <p>On the face of it, the bookies offering short odds on Hargreaves make sense - he was born in Cleethorpes and began his career at Blundell Park, making over 50 appearances for his hometown club.</p>
      <p>However, the links may well prompt some raised eyebrows, with Hargreaves having not managed a senior team since leaving Torquay United in 2015.</p>
      <p>Hargreaves has half a season's experience at management at League Two level, taking over the Gulls in January 2014.</p>
      <p>He was unable to save them from relegation despite an upturn in performances and results, and then led them to 14th in the National League in his one full season in charge at Plainmoor.</p>
      <p>Hargreaves has previously also held a coaching role at Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>His stint as assistant manager of <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">the Gas</a> last season, helping them to avoid relegation from League One, combined with the fact he is well-known around the lower-league game thanks to his punditry roles on BT Sport, may well stand him in good stead should he want the job.</p>
