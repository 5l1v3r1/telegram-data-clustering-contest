      <p>Host <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/piers-morgan/">Piers Morgan</a> asked her: "How's your love life which I keep reading about. On-off, on-off, on-off. Is it on or off?"</p>
      <p>Gemma replied: "It's good. It's very much on, Piers. James are you up out of bed yet?"</p>
      <aside>I can't wait much longer, it's either soon or I'm out of there.</aside>
      <p>Piers asked: "You are back on?" to which Gemma insisted: "Yes, well, yes. Last time I spoke to him we were."</p>
      <p>Piers asked: "When was that?" as Gemma replied: "Last night but you never know, things could be different this morning... no I'm only joking. Everything is good, everything's good. I'm happy."</p>
      <p>The presenter asked: "Any wedding bells? Has he ever asked you?" to which Gemma said: "Well, I'm waiting. No [he hasn't]."</p>

      <p>Piers said: "Would that help calm things?"</p>
      <p>Gemma admitted: "I don't know, Piers."</p>
      <p>Turning to the camera, Piers said: "Look James, Christmas is coming. This lady wants you to propose marriage."</p>
      <p>Gemma confessed: "I can't wait much longer, it's either soon or I'm out of there. [Marriage] is not for everyone, it's a tie isn't it. Unless you really love them, you're going to be tied to them for a long time.</p>
      <p>"But I am getting a little bit older now Piers, I need the big bling on the finger. If it's meant to be it'll be and if it's not, it's not. I don't lose any sleep over it.</p>

      <p>"I need to be made an honest woman of."</p>
      <p>Piers said: "Well it can't get more direct than this. Come on James, if you're awake and out of bed..."</p>
      <p>Gemma told the camera: "Call De Beers Diamonds now James. Wakey, wakey, get on the phone and [get] a nice big yellow rock."</p>
      <p>Piers asked: "How big a rock?" to which Gemma said: "Like Elizabeth Taylor's."</p>
