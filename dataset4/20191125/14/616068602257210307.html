      <p>Julia Fellman was driving the morning of Dec. 20, 2017, when the driver of a black Mercedes SUV passed her at high speed.</p>
      <p>The vice-principal of Hillcrest Elementary was so surprised, she looked down at her own speedometer to check her speed.</p>
      <p>“I was going 50,” Fellman testified Monday on the first day of Tenessa Nikirk’s trial in Victoria. Nikirk is charged with dangerous driving causing bodily harm. “And the SUV appeared to be going faster and faster as it accelerated away from me.”</p>
      <p>Nikirk struck 11-year-old Leila Bui, leaving her with brain damage, a fractured neck and a lacerated spleen.</p>
      <p>Fellman testified that she watched the black SUV disappear over the crest of the hill.</p>
      <p>“When I got to the top of the hill, I saw the black SUV had stopped. There were about four vehicles stopped at the crosswalk and on the opposite side I saw the top of the head of what looked like a small person or a child beside the second car,” Fellman said.</p>
      <p>Admissions of fact, read into the court record, show that between 8 and 8:20 a.m., Nikirk sent 11 text messages and received 13 texts from a 604 number. Leila was hit between 8:15 and 8:16 a.m.</p>
      <p>The evidence will show that Leila was thrown quite a distance.</p>
      <p>Expert witnesses and collision analysts are expected to testify about the speed the black Mercedes was going.</p>
