      <h1>Watch: BBC Drops ‘Doctor Who’ Season 12 Trailer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:59:42+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/stephanie_m/" target="_blank">Stephanie Mlot</a></address>
      <p>As promised, the BBC on Saturday gave audiences our first proper look at the new season of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIz50Iu-_Zs&amp;feature=emb_title"><i>Doctor Who</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The minute-long trailer teases the same hijinks, humor, and heart we’ve come to know and love (if not expect) over the last five decades.</p>
      <p>Jodie Whittaker returns as the Thirteenth Doctor, who, alongside companions Yaz (Mandip Gill), Ryan (Tosin Cole), and Graham (Bradley Walsh), is ready to defend the universe once again.</p>

      <h3>The Name’s Doctor, The Doctor</h3>
      <p>In a rare out-of-costume moment, the Doctor leads Team TARDIS to what appears to be (or has been mistaken for) a black-tie event. Once the shock of seeing Whittaker’s Time Lord out of her braces and boots wore off, I was delighted by her suit-and-tie ensemble—a modern choice for a progressive character.</p>
      <h3>A Bit of Fry and Henry</h3>
      <p>The BBC last week <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/stephen-fry-sir-lenny-henry-to-guest-star-in-doctor-who-season-opener-1811425/">announced</a> British TV legends Stephen Fry (<i>Bones</i>) and Sir Lenny Henry CBE (<i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i>) will guest star in the series opener. So Fry’s dramatic observation that “The security of this entire planet is at stake” suggests a sensational start to the new season.</p>
      <p>Blink and you’ll miss Henry’s appearance as a gleeful gunman shooting at the dolled-up friends riding motorcycles through what looks like a winery.</p>
      <h3>Oh non</h3>
      <p>No stranger to a history lesson, <i>Doctor Who</i> transports the team to World War II France, where the Doctor &amp; Co. will undoubtedly once again meet Nazi foes. And maybe another familiar enemy…?</p>
      <h3>The Cybermen Are Coming!</h3>
      <p>In a tense twist, the Time Lord declares that “something’s coming for me.” Cut to a rusty-looking <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/mondasian-cybermen-return-for-doctor-who-finale-1691331/">Cyberman</a>* marching through a fiery field, out for Gallifreyan blood. Could mean the end of the Doctor, who may be on her final regeneration? The titular character certainly won’t go down without a fight.</p>
      <h3>Jo Tro Do Plo Plo No</h3>
      <p><i>What?</i> <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/jo-tro-do-plo-plo-no-doctor-who-welcomes-back-familiar-monster-1788213/">As we know</a>, the rhinoceros-headed Judoon are back—more than 12 years after stampeding onto the Moon to terrorize the Tenth Doctor and Martha Jones.</p>
      <h3>Aliens and Spaceships and Birds, Oh My!</h3>
      <p>The frenetic trailer doesn’t offer much in the way of specifics. Eagle-eyed viewers may recognize the return of <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/doctor-who-underrated-villain-of-the-week-racnoss-1701909/">half-human, half-spider race Racnoss</a>, which terrorized Earth in the 2006 Christmas special “The Runaway Bride.” There are also hints of a storyline involving Nikola Tesla (I think), a robotic scorpion, and Hitchcock-style swarms of birds.</p>
      <p>Goran Višnjić (<i>ER</i>) and Robert Glenister (<i>Paranoid</i>) are also <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/doctorwho/entries/fdb98f3d-2738-4c56-84ef-13109683d59c">set to appear</a> in an episode of series 12—coming “early 2020.”</p>
      <p>(<a href="http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/rumour-no-xmas-day-special-series-12-begins-new-years-day-91211.htm">Rumor has it</a> the show’s 10-episode run will kick off on New Year’s Day.)</p>
      <p>Catch up on the gang’s latest adventures in our recaps of <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/doctor-who-episode-10-what-season-finale-lacks-tardis-fam-makes-up-for-1765138/">season 11 finale</a> “The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos” and <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/doctor-who-new-years-day-special-team-tardis-save-the-world-again-1767908/">2019 New Year’s special</a> “Resolution.”</p>
      <p>* I admittedly groaned my way through the trailer’s Cybermen scenes, dreading the return of one of the show’s most overused characters. But showrunner Chris Chibnall surprised me with his skillful sort-of Dalek origin story early this year. Maybe he can pull another miracle out of his hat in 2020.</p>
