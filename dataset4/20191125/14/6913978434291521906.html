      <p><b>BEIRUT —</b> Supporters of the Hezbollah and Amal movements attacked Lebanese anti-government protesters in Beirut on Monday, with army reinforcements intervening to diffuse tensions.<br/><br/>Shortly before midnight on Sunday, men on foot and scooters arrived at a roadblock set up by anti-graft protesters across a key street in the capital, local television showed.<br/><br/>They shouted insults and chanted in support of the chiefs of the Shiite movements Hezbollah and Amal, before briefly breaking through and attacking some demonstrators.<br/><br/>Those at the roadblock chanted "peaceful, peaceful", as the security forces and army reinforcements deployed in a thick line between both sides in the early hours of Monday morning.<br/><br/>The counter-protesters also headed to a main nerve center of protests nearby and destroyed tents there, a local television channel said.<br/><br/>The tensions came after a peaceful day of demonstrations, more than a month into a spontaneous nationwide street movement against the political elite.<br/><br/>On Saturday, Lebanese security forces briefly detained five youths, including three minors, for allegedly pulling down a sign for President Michel Aoun's political party in the town of Hammana east of Beirut, sparking outrage on social media.<br/><br/>Security forces released them after midnight, the Committee of Lawyers for the Defense of Protesters said.<br/><br/>The army said two of the children were 15 years old and the third was 12.<br/><br/>"Down with the regime that arrests children," a Twitter user said.<br/><br/>"When a 12-year-old child manages to shake the state's throne, you know the state is corrupt," another wrote.<br/><br/>During the first month of demonstrations, security forces arrested 300 people including 12 minors who were released within 24 to 48 hours, according to the lawyers' committee.<br/><br/>But 11 people — including two minors — remain in detention accused of attacking a hotel in the southern city of Tyre during the first week of the uprising.<br/><br/>The demonstrators managed to bring down the government less than two weeks into the protests, but it remains in a caretaker capacity and no new cabinet has since been formed.<br/><br/>Late Sunday, protesters blocked major roads in several parts of the country and called for a general strike the following day in protest at the lack of progress in forming a fresh government.<br/><br/>Earlier, hundreds had gathered in protest centers in Beirut, the northern city of Tripoli and in Tyre.<br/><br/>In Beirut's Martyrs' Square, hundreds of women and men demanded their rights, some waving the national red and white flag or chanting "Revolution, Revolution!"<br/><br/>Lebanon's protests have brought together people of all ages from across the political spectrum, tired of what they describe as sectarian politics three decades after a civil war.<br/><br/>In the latest show of unity, a festive mood had reigned Sunday afternoon as Lebanese came together in public spaces across the country on the second day of the weekend.<br/><br/>North of the capital women prepared traditional salads to share, while a group of men danced on a beach south of the city, state television footage showed.<br/><br/>The Free Patriotic Movement party that Aoun founded is now led by his son-in-law, outgoing foreign minister Gibran Bassil, one of the most reviled figures in the protests.<br/><br/>Hezbollah is the only party not to have disarmed after the 1975-1990 civil war and plays a key role in Lebanese politics. — AFP</p>
