      <p>An investigation is underway at a Devon hospital after a patient is believed to have taken their own life on a mental health ward.</p>
      <p>The Devon Partnership Trust has confirmed there was an "unexpected death" on a ward it operates at North Devon District Hospital in Barnstaple.</p>
      <p>The Trust, which is responsible for mental health care across the county, would not confirm the exact date of the incident but it is believed to have happened within the past two weeks.</p>
      <p>Devon Partnership Trust operates three main mental health wards at the hospital, including the Ocean View ward and the Moorland ward.</p>
      <p>It is not known at which ward the incident took place.</p>

      <p>The news of the suspected suicide was revealed when Devon Live was contacted by an anonymous source at the hospital.</p>
      <p>The person got in touch after reading our report last week on <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/devons-lack-mental-health-beds-3564636">the loss of a further eight mental health beds</a> at the hospital due to staff shortages.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Devon Partnership NHS Trust confirmed that there had been an unexpected death and that an investigation is under way.</p>
      <p>Devon Live also contacted the Northern Devon Healthcare NHS Trust, but as they do not run the ward they declined to comment.</p>

      <p>Last week we reported how a further eight mental health beds were set to be lost at North Devon District Hospital - bringing the total loss this year to 16.</p>
      <p>In May, Devon Partnership trust (DPT) confirmed beds at the hospital were being closed, but would not state how many and confirmed there were no plans to close either of its mental health wards.</p>
      <p>Despite claiming it was a 'short term issue', the following month it confirmed the loss of eight beds and said it had 'temporarily' merged two wards to create one 24-bed ward.</p>
      <p>Further reassurances were made it planned to reopen the other ward following a recruitment drive.</p>
      <p>However, last week an NHS whistleblower told Devon Live that eight more mental health beds were set to be lost.  They said the remaining beds would be prioritised for local people.</p>
      <p>The whistleblower said: “It is leaving us with just 16 beds left."</p>
      <p>Adding: “It’s disgraceful. They are going to use the remaining 16 beds solely for north Devon patients.</p>
      <p>DPT runs adult mental health provisions in the county. Following its latest CQC inspection, the results of which were published last month, one of its four core services were rated outstanding, one as good, one as requires improvement and one inadequate.</p>
      <p>The overall rating given was 'good'.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Devon Partnership NHS Trust said: “We have had to temporarily suspend some of our inpatient beds in north Devon because of severe difficulty in recruiting qualified mental health nurses.</p>
      <p>"The situation is under continuous review and we will start to re-open beds as soon as it improves.”</p>
