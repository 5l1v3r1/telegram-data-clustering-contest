      <h1>Cindy Thompson Exposes Gospel Artists Not Called By God</h1>

      <p>Veteran Gospel musician, Cindy Thompson has cautioned consumers of Gospel music to be wary of fake gospel artists since it’s not all of them who are doing the work of God.</p>
      <p>The singer shared her opinion on this subject with Graphic Showbiz in an interview.</p>
      <p><b>“The fact that people tell you, you have a nice voice doesn’t mean you are called by God. You may have the gift which comes to everyone in different ways but God should direct you as to what you have to do with it and how to use it,”</b> she said.</p>
      <p>Buttressing her point further, she said:</p>
      <p>
        <b>“I believe this so very much because I recall I had an event in Holland and before my performance, a choir came to sing very beautifully.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>After the show, we had to go and grab something to eat and to my surprise I saw the choristers taking their robes off, pulling out cigarettes and alcohol and I was shocked.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“I went to ask them if they knew what they were doing was wrong and to my amazement, they answered that they were not Christians but only singers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Some said, they sang because they have the voice and people encouraged them to join the choir but they were not believers of the things of God or Christians.”</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>“I had another experience in Benin as well so yes it is not every Gospel artiste that is called by God</b>,” she told Graphic Showbiz.</p>
      <p>When asked to explain how a ‘real’ gospel artist operate she answered thus: <b>“Anyone who is called by God understands the ministry he or she is in.”</b></p>
      <p>“<b>Whatever step one takes, one asks God for guidance; one waits for Him to speak before one acts.</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>When one has been called by God, one does not associate with the things of this world.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>One is not in competition with anyone because one trusts the person who has called you,” </b>she noted.</p>
