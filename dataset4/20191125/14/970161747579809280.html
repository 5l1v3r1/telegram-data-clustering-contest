      <p>Perfect, winged eyeliner is the holy grail of sleek, sophisticated make-up looks. But it’s damn-near impossible to get right.</p>
      <p>We normally end up with one perfect eye, and one panda eye – and then spend the next 45 minutes trying to even them out. And we do not have time for this nonsense.</p>
      <p>Luckily, a stylist has revealed her simple trick for drawing professional-looking winged eyeliner in seconds.</p>

      <p>Susie Hasler, 36, from East Grinstead, West Sussex, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B41pc4TAeTf/">posted a video to her Instagram</a> followers revealing how she mastered the look by using eyeshadow pads from Amazon – which only cost about £1.</p>

      <p>The mum-of-one, who specialises in styling women whose body shapes have changed, shared a tutorial showing how she applied her eyeliner, and the finished look.</p>
      <p>The post, entitled ‘cheat your way to winged eyeliner’, has already attracted more than 6,000 views in just a few days on Susie’s account.</p>
      <p>Susie said in the footage that a makeup stylist friend had recommended the eyeshadow pads, adding: ‘I have tried so many tutorials and just can’t do it.’</p>

      <p>Susie demonstrates in the video where to apply the pads on her face, and then continues to add eyeshadow to the edges of her eyelid, working her way in.</p>
      <p>‘It’s basically like a stencil,’ Susie explains. ‘And it stops those dark colours going under your eyes.’</p>
      <p>She also reveals how using brighter colours towards the centre of the eyelids helps to ‘open up your eyes’.</p>

      <p>Susie uses a pen eyeliner to draw along the curve of the eyeshadow pad, away from her eye. She then reveals the finished look.</p>
      <p>Susie added: ‘Winged eyeliner is a great way to at a bit of edginess to a look, but it’s also really tricky to do it right.</p>
      <p>‘I loved hearing about this simple trick and wanted to share it with my followers, as it really does work!’</p>

      <p>The post attracted loads of comments from fans and people desperate to try the technique for themselves. Hagardashery wrote: ‘They look great what a good idea!’</p>
      <p>Daughterofpearl added: ‘Ooh I love that! I’m always 50/50 when it comes to liquid eyeliner. It either looks badass or terrible.’</p>
      <p>‘You can buy those Make up pads in primark too 50 for £1.50 :)’ said Itsaboss_life.</p>
