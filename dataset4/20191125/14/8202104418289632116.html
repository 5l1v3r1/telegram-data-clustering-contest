      <h3>I volunteered at the kid’s area at the FSIN pow wow a couple weeks ago. I started off small by organizing the paper, glitter and dull scissors — but then I noticed a long line forming for the face-painters.</h3>
      <p>There were multiple lines of little girls in ages ranging from five to eight and while they were patient, they had that desperate look on their faces that I get when I see a 50 per cent off sale at Old Navy. I thought, how hard could it be?</p>
      <p>Still I hesitated before sitting down at the face-painter table because I am not good at drawing. In fact, during my lifetime I have twice seen my drawings held up to the mockery of my coworkers, “THAT’S SUPPOSED TO BE A HORSE? WHY DOES IT HAVE A DOG’S HEAD?”</p>
      <p>To be fair, horses are like level 10 when it comes to art.</p>
      <p>But all the self-help books tell me that you are supposed to jump into challenges, not run from them. That you are supposed to feel uncomfortable and then more uncomfortable … and then, I dunno, something magical happens (or you get diarrhea)?</p>
      <p>The first little girl sat down and asked for a dreamcatcher on her cheek. I Googled “dreamcatcher” and shook my head. I pointed at one of the other volunteers, a woman with her eyeliner and blush perfectly executed: “Now that’s your girl over there. Next?”</p>
      <p>The next little girl was about seven and her name was Marie. She explained that she had already had her face painted, washed it off and wanted something new. I felt like I had been sent to teach her the lesson that the grass is always greener or don’t go chasing waterfalls.</p>
      <p>She wanted me to make her into Minnie Mouse, complete with a pink polka dotted bow. I was armed with only Q-tips and a lot of paint, but I decided to go for it. I was having trouble with the black paint for her mouse ears and Marie pointed out that you were supposed to dip the Q-tip in water. That’s a pro-tip. (Maybe Marie was sent to teach me!)</p>
      <p>We got the ears done and then I started on the bow, which was a herculean task because it had to go all the way across her forehead. I started sweating like Don Cherry at a multicultural festival, but I had committed to that bow and I finished it. After that it was just dotting in the polka dots. I hesitated to show Marie the picture, but when she saw it, she smiled.</p>
      <p>There was no time to celebrate as the next girl was already in the seat. This one had shrewd eyes and she asked for a small bee on her cheek, having already figured out that my skill was in dots and not large pictures. I nailed the bee and thought maybe I should switch careers. Perhaps I’ve had it all wrong — novels aren’t the place for me, children’s parties are the way to go.</p>
      <p>That’s when the five-year-old sat down. Her mother hovered behind her and though she didn’t look mad, I already felt scared. Her daughter asked for a lady bug on her cheek. It was small and not complex, so I took a deep breath and dived in.</p>
      <p>Things started to go sideways right from the start. First of all, ladybugs have these curly whisker things that are really hard to make with a big, fatheaded Q-tip. Second, five-year-olds do not sit still the same way that seven-year-olds do. She kept turning her head this way and that. My outline of the lady bug was uneven … and it was only the beginning …</p>
      <p>I realized that I had reached the extent of my ability to decorate tiny faces and I tapped out. I called in one of the more senior face painters (meaning they had been there a couple hours longer than me). “So, this picture is a two face-painter-job?” the mom asked with more than a little bit of sarcasm.</p>
      <p>“It sure is,” I answered as I ran away, glad to be out of the firing line and a bit pleased to be mistaken for a real face-painter.</p>
