      <p>With <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/legends-of-tomorrow/">DC's Legends of Tomorrow</a></i>'s Season 5 premiere airing after <a href="https://www.cbr.com/cw-legends-tomorrow-season-5-debut-date/">a special episode</a> that ties into the upcoming "<a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths/">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>" crossover, fans might be wondering when exactly the season takes place. However, according to "Crisis" showrunner Marc Guggenheim, the premiere, as well as the following six episodes of the season, all take place before the event.</p>
      <p>On Twitter, a fan asked Guggenheim about whether the first seven episodes take place before or after "Crisis," to which he replied, "Before. It will be very clear."</p>

      <p>Guggenheim didn't delve any further into what would happen in those episodes, though given what the Season 4 finale of <i>Legends</i> had set up, the team may have been too busy to prepare for the event.</p>
      <p>Season 5 of <i>DC's Legends of Tomorrow </i>will also see the departure of series star <a href="https://www.cbr.com/legends-of-tomorrow-brandon-routh-courtney-ford-season-5-exit/">Brandon Routh</a>, who plays the Ray Palmer incarnation of the Atom and who has been a part of the cast since the series premiere. However, with the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/crisis-on-infinite-earths-osric-chau-ryan-choi-atom/">Ryan Choi Atom</a> set to debut in "Crisis," it's possible he could fill the void Routh leaves behind.</p>
      <p>Returning Jan. 21, 2020, <i>DC’s Legends of Tomorrow</i> stars Caity Lotz, Dominic Purcell, Brandon Routh, Nick Zano, Maisie Richardson-Sellers, Tala Ashe, Matt Ryan, Jes Macallan and Courtney Ford.</p>
