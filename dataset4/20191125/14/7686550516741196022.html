      <h1>BBC Sports Personality of the Year shortlist 2019: Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones nominated for prestigious award</h1>
      <h2>Jones led Wales to the Six Nations Grand Slam in the saw year that he became the nation's record cap-holder</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:57:25+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:57</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Southcombe</a></address>
      <p>Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones has been nominated for BBC Sports Personality of the Year.</p>
      <p>The indomitable 34-year-old led Wales to the Grand Slam in style earlier this year, helping them beat Ireland 25-7 on the final day in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>Perhaps even more impressive is that he played the majority of the game with ligament damage in his knee and was one of Wales' top performers on the day.</p>
      <p>On a personal note, the second row became Wales' record cap-holder at this year's Rugby World Cup, taking over Gethin Jenkins. When he led the side out against Australia, he earned his 130th cap, making him the most-capped Welshman of all time.</p>
      <p>By the end of the World Cup, he'd moved into second on the all-time cap list and currently sits five behind leader Richie McCaw, a milestone he looks destined to surpass.</p>
      <p>Following the conclusion of the World Cup, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/alun-wyn-jones-wales-rugby-17192869">legends of the game lauded the Wales skipper</a> , with 1995 World Cup-winner Francois Pienaar branding him 'the best captain in the world'.</p>
      <p>"I’ve said that if you look at how he’s rallied his team, when they were down and out and they came back when they shouldn’t have. I put that down to him," Pienaar told WalesOnline after the World Cup.</p>

      <p>“To make that call against South Africa in the scrum. I thought ‘wow’ and bang, it got them right back in the game.</p>
      <p>“That’s the mark of a great captain. I’m a fan of the way he handles himself. When I saw him put his arm around that little mascot singing the anthem, I thought ‘that’s generosity of spirit’.</p>
      <p>“He's a great, great servant of the game and has really done well. If you look at the Welsh performances over the last two years, they’ve been phenomenal.”</p>
      <p>Announcing Jones as a nominee, last year's winner Geraint Thomas said: "You've had an incredible year and I'm going to tell everyone why they should vote for you.</p>
      <p>"You led Wales to a Six Nations Grand Slam, were their star player at the Rugby World Cup and became Wales' most capped player.</p>
      <p>"You're a legend mate and you've got my vote. Everyone should vote for Alun on the night."</p>
      <p>Jones finds himself on a shortlist with the great and the good of British sport.</p>
      <p>Also nominated so far is England cricket star Ben Stokes, whose heroics hauled England back into the cricket World Cup final before eventually helping his side over the line.</p>
