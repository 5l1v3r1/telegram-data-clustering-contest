      <h1>‘Priceless’ jewellery stolen in German museum heist</h1>

      <p>Three jewellery sets of diamonds and rubies were stolen from a state museum in Germany in a brazen heist on Monday, director Marion Ackermann said, calling the haul “priceless”.</p>
      <p>Ackermann refused to estimate the exact value of the items stolen from a display cabinet at the near 300-year-old Green Vault museum in Dresden, adding that the jewellery was of “inestimable cultural and historical value.”</p>
      <p>The German state museum holds one of the biggest collection of baroque treasures in Europe.</p>
      <p>The Green Vault at Dresden’s Royal Palace, which is home to around 4,000 precious objects made of ivory, gold, silver and jewels, was broken into early Monday morning.</p>
      <p>“This morning there was a break-in at the Green Vault,” police in Saxony state confirmed on Twitter, adding that an estimate of the damages was “not yet possible”.</p>
      <p><i>Bild</i> newspaper reported meanwhile that “antique jewellery worth around a billion euros has been stolen” in what it called “probably the biggest art theft since World War Two.”</p>
      <p>One of the oldest museums in Europe, the Green Vault holds treasures including a 63.8-centimetre figure of a Moor studded with emeralds and a 547.71-carat sapphire gifted by Tsar Peter I of Russia.</p>
      <p><i>Bild</i> said the criminals had broken into the well-protected palace by attacking a nearby power distributor and climbing through a window.</p>
      <p>They then proceeded to target smaller items of jewellery, leaving larger, bulkier items behind, Bild claimed, without citing sources.</p>
      <p>Founded by August the Strong, Elector of Saxony in 1723, the Green Vault is one of 12 museums which make up the famous Dresden State Art Collections.</p>
      <p>Its historic section, which contains around three-quarters of the museum’s treasures, was the one broken into on Monday.</p>
      <p>With a strict limit on the amount of daily visitors, entrance to the historic vault can only be reserved in advance.</p>
      <p>Exhibits are arranged into nine rooms, including an ivory room, a silver-gilt room and the central “Hall of Treasures”.</p>
      <p>One of its most valuable pieces, the green diamond, is currently on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where it is a headline attraction in the temporary exhibition “Making Marvels: Science and Splendor at the Courts of Europe”.</p>
      <p>After the Royal Palace suffered severe damage in World War Two, the Green Vault remained closed for decades before it was restored and re-opened in 2006.</p>
      <p>For Saxony’s state premier, the heist went beyond the value of the artefacts stolen.</p>
      <p>“The treasures that are found in the Green Vault and the Dresden Royal palace were hard-earned by the people of Saxony over many centuries,” said Michael Kretschmer.</p>
      <p>“One cannot understand the history of our country, our state without the Green Vault and Saxony’s State Art Collections.”</p>
      <p>In 2010, the museum hosted a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and then President of the United States Barack Obama, on the latter’s first state visit to Germany.</p>
      <p>Monday’s theft is the second high-profile heist in Germany in recent years, after a 100kg, 24-carat giant gold coin was stolen.</p>
