      <p>ALOR STAR, Nov 25 — Two government retirees lost a total of RM190,000 after being duped by a Macau scam syndicate in two separate incidents in Kota Setar district recently.</p>
      <p>Kota Setar district police chief ACP Mohd Rozi said in the first incident on Nov 13, the 49-year-old victim received a call from a man who introduced himself as a representative of Telekom Malaysia based in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
      <p>“The man informed the victim that he had a outstanding bill before the line was transferred to a man claiming to be a police officer from the Kuala Lumpur police contingent headquarters, who told him that he was involved in the movement of illegal funds.</p>
      <p>“The victim was then instructed to transfer money to a bank account for bail and investigations payment. The worried victim then made 29 transactions totalling RM180,000 to the account,” he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>He said using the same modus operandi, the syndicate, on Nov 18, scammed another retiree, aged 62, who ended up losing 9,000 to them.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mohd Rozi said 65 police reports over Macau scam cases were lodged in the district between January and October, involving losses totalling RM1.67 million.</p>
      <p>He said police had made several arrests of those who conspired with the scammers by providing them bank account numbers.</p>
      <p>Mohd Rozi advised the public not to panic easily when receiving such calls as the police, courts or bank have no authority to order cash transfers to third party accounts. — Bernama</p>
