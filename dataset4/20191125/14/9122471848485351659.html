      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:54:14+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Ohio State improved to 11-0 on Saturday, topping Penn State at Ohio Stadium. The Buckeyes went up big early, but nearly collapsed in the second half, ultimately holding off the Nittany Lions in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Penn State started to feel itself a bit in the second half. The Nittany Lions forced multiple turnovers, leading to the near-comeback.</p>
      <p>One Penn State player, defensive back Lamont Wade, had a viral celebration on the sideline.</p>
      <p>Wade had forced a Buckeyes’ fumble:</p>

      <p>Ohio State standout defensive lineman Chase Young, who dominated the Nittany Lions’ offense all game long, has responded to the celebration on Twitter:</p>

      <p>It seemed to be all in good fun, though.</p>

      <p>Young was the star of Saturday’s game, returning from a two-game suspension. He had three sacks, setting the Buckeyes’ single-season sack record at 16.5.</p>
      <p>“I was itching to get back on the field, just not being on there for two weeks,” Young said. “I just tried to give it all I had today and we won the game, and that’s all we care about.”</p>
