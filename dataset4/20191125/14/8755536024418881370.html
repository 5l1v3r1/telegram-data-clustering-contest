      <p>Victoria Beckham has revealed that one of her children used her fame to garner more social media clout.</p>
      <p>Speaking on The Ellen DeGeneres show, Victoria explained that 17-year-old son Romeo recently joined teen video app TikTok, and wanted to launch his profile with a band,</p>
      <p>Victoria said that her son asked if she would do a dance with him for the app.</p>

      <p>“What should we dance to? He said ‘the Spice Girls,'” Victoria said in the clip.</p>
      <p>“And then he took my phone, he posted it on my Instagram and said ‘That’ll get my numbers up’… He used me!”</p>
      <p>The pair danced to Spice Up Your Life in the kitchen of their home.</p>

      <p>However, Victoria wasn’t impressed with her son’s dance moves.</p>
      <p>“It was a lot of fun, but I have to say I think that Romeo definitely takes after his dad with his moves,” she joked.</p>
      <p>Touching on her son Brooklyn, Ellen asked the designer how she felt about him being listed in People’s 2019 Sexiest Man Alive issue.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know if I want to know that,” Vic replied. “I don’t need to know.”</p>
