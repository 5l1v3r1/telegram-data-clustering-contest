        <b>Several Tottenham players said their goodbyes to Mauricio Pochettino at the Argentine's house after he was axed as manager last week.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The north London club severed ties with the 47-year-old after five years at the helm following a poor run of results that dates back to January.</p>
      <p>A breakdown in relations between Pochettino and Tottenham chiefs was clear, but the timing of the decision still bought about plenty of shock.</p>
      <p>Harry Kane, who was a major beneficiary of Pochettino's tenure, went to console his former mentor and concedes the club have asked to keep quiet about how he was informed, reports <i>The Mirror</i>.</p>
      <p>“They’ve asked me not to talk about it," said the Tottenham marksman.</p>
      <p>But he added: “I went round his house and caught up with him the next day.</p>
      <p>“It was a shock for everyone, so I wanted to go and see him and we had a chat for a couple of hours and it was nice to do that before the new manager came in.”</p>
      <p>Eric Dier, who had lost his way under Pochettino but is expected to be a favourite under Jose Mourinho, also spoke to the Argentine following his dismissal.</p>
      <p>But he insists, while emotion was present, the players had to remain focused ahead of the weekend's action.</p>
      <p>He said: “We found out that night [through the club]. And obviously it was quite emotional.</p>
      <p>“It was important for everyone to be able to go to see him. I spoke with him and it was good to be able to do that.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a week I’ve never really had in my career before. A big shock on Tuesday night for everyone, the players included.</p>
      <p>“Then it was a quick turnaround - all of a sudden we got a new manager, one of the best managers there has been in the game.</p>
      <p>“So you have to automatically have to turn your head towards that and focus on the game. Obviously, a lot of emotion, a lot of energy, but since the gaffer came in it was all about: ‘Just prepare for Saturday, get yourselves ready, you don’t have to impress me on days one and two, just run about and waste your energy.’</p>
      <p>“So it was about going out there and performing and thankfully we got the win.”</p>
