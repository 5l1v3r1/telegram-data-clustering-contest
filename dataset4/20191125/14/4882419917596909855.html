      <h2>L'Equipe report that talks between the player and the club are advancing well</h2>

      <p>Paris Saint-Germain are confident that they will finally get star forward Kylian Mbappe to sign a new long-term contract with the club, according to L'Eqipe, who say that recent talks between the club and the player have been positive.</p>
      <p>The report says that first contact was made at the beginning of November and that negotiations have continued since, with Mbappe said to be more open to putting pen to paper than he was a few months ago.</p>
      <p>All the while, Real Madrid have remained as a threat to PSG in the background. Los Blancos are long-time fans of the French international and <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/real-madrid/hazard-if-i-could-help-bring-mbappe-to-madrid-tomorrow-i-would-7749539"><b>Eden Hazard has voiced his desire to line up alongside him</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The Ligue 1 champions, through sporting director Leonardo, will continue to work hard for Mbappe to renew. He joined the club from Monaco in 2017 and has a deal until 2020. Leonardo wants to extend his terms and improve his salary.</p>
