      <p>‘It is still too soon to say anything, as this community is hurting, but what I will say there was very much an outpouring of love for this young man.’</p>
      <p>Scott had not been seen since Thursday, November 21, and police launched a public appeal to help find him.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, November 23, police were called to a remote woodland location on the outskirts of the village following an ‘incident’, where they found the boy’s body.</p>
      <p>A cordon was put in place for several hours while police and forensic teams investigated the area and residents were advised to stay away from the scene.</p>
      <p>He had been reported missing to the police on Thursday evening, after being last seen at about 5.30pm.</p>
