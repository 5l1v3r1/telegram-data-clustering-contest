      <p><a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/shania-twain">Shania Twain</a> and <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a> were two of many huge names that attended the American Music Awards last night in Los Angeles, California, at the Microsoft Theater and posed for a photo together at the ceremony. Twain shared a shot of the duo to her Instagram account where they both rocked pink ensembles.</p>
      <p>Swift owned a glittery gold garment which she paired a sheer pink cape over the top. The “We Are Never Getting Back Together” hitmaker sported her blond hair behind her ears and applied a red lip. Shania, on the other hand, also stunned in a pink cape-style dress with fishnet tights. She owned her curly hair down and appeared to be very happy to be in the photo with Taylor.</p>
      <p>For her caption, Twain described the photo as “pretty in pink,” attaching a red heart emoji.</p>
      <p>In the span of six hours, her post racked up more than 42,000 likes and over 660 comments, proving to be popular with her 1 million followers.</p>
      <p>“Diamond selling crossover legends,” one user wrote.</p>
      <p>“You are such a Queen Shania Twain,” another shared.</p>
      <p>“TWO ICONIC QUEENS, LETS GO GIRLS,” a third fan remarked passionately in capital letters.</p>
      <p>“Wow!!! It only seems like yesterday that you were the young ingenue, and now you’re an inspiration for our future stars. The circle of life indeed,” a fourth follower commented.</p>
