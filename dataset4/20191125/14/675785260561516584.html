      <p>A doctor has hit back at a Question Time audience member who said doctors earn over £80,000 - by sharing his £48,000 payslip.</p>
      <p>Last week IT consultant Rob Barber appeared on BBC Question Time and claimed he was not in the country's top 50% of earners - despite earning over £80,000.</p>
      <p>He said: "Every doctor in this country earns more than that. Every doctor, every accountant, every solicitor earns more than that. That's not five percent."</p>
      <p>Now, Dr Asif Munaf has shared his own payslip on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , revealing his £48,000 payslip</p>
      <p>He said: "This guy is terribly misinformed.</p>

      <p>"I spent 6 years at medschool and a further 7 years of specialist training and I get paid £48,000.</p>
      <p>"He needs to #factscheck and use some of his £80,000 on a new shirt and a trim."</p>
      <p>Dr Munaf, who has an 18-month-old son, also revealed his wage is the only income for his family.</p>
      <p>After appearing on the political panel show, it was revealed Rob, 36, was an IT consultant and champion professional motorcycle racer.</p>
      <p>Rob, from Bury, Lancashire, runs race team PBR Racing alongside his dad Phil.</p>

      <p>He has had multiple podium finishes in the TT Zero, including a second place in 2010 Isle of Man TT and third at the 2013 Isle of Man TT and 2014 Isle of Man TT.</p>
      <p>During his questioning on the show, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> MP Richard Burgon and host Fiona Bruce went on to attempt to explain how those earning £80,000 are in fact in the top 5% of earners.</p>
      <p>According to the most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics, an income of £75,300 places an earner in the top 5 per cent.</p>
      <p>Under Labour's plan for a 45p rate on earnings over £80,000, he would pay an extra £4.81 per week if he earned £85,000 per year.</p>

      <p>Question Time viewers took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> calling out the audience member.</p>
      <p>Josie Hall said: "God I would love to earn £80,000 a year! My husband and I run a 2 man business, work hard and earn not a fraction of that! Yet every year we pay Corporation tax and happy and willing to pay more so we are all secure! I just don't understand."</p>
      <p>Tom Joad said: "The beauty of a manifesto that only raises taxes for those earning over £80,000 a year is that it only highlights the greed of those affected when they shout about it like this idiot did."</p>
