      <h3>How to fix iPhone 11 overheating issues</h3>
      <h4>Solution 1: Restart your iPhone</h4>
      <p>As we already suggested, when you notice your iPhone is getting hot, you should let it cool off first. Once it is back to normal, restart it. A restart will close the processes and apps that run in the background. Also, it will refresh the memory of the phone.</p>
      <h4>Solution 2: All about apps</h4>
      <p>Smartphones would not be fun without apps, right? So, everything goes around apps. The first thing you should do is see how the apps behave. You can do that by viewing Battery usage information. Go to Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Background Activity. There, you can see how the apps behave in the background and how they affect battery life. Usually, the apps that affect battery life the most are the ones that can cause overheating as well. You may turn off Background activity for the apps you want.</p>
      <h4>Solution 3: Remove the apps you don’t use</h4>
      <p>If you have a bunch of apps that you don’t use, remove them from your device. This is a pretty simple thing to do but you may find it effective.</p>
      <h4>Solution 4: Update the apps</h4>
      <p>As we mentioned before, it is all about apps. So, now you know the background activity, you have removed the apps you don’t use, it is the time to update the ones you have. Open the App Store and choose the option to update all.</p>
      <h4>Solution 5: Update the software</h4>
      <p>People often forget how important software updates are. When you think about an update, you are usually focused on new features. But, software updates are more than new features. Every new version includes security patches, and most importantly, bug fixes. Here is what you need to do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to Settings</li>
        <li>Tap General</li>
        <li>Tap Software update.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If there is a new version, tap Download and Install.</p>
      <h4>Solution 6: Reset all settings</h4>
      <p>To reset all settings on your device, follow the steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset</li>
        <li>Tap Reset all settings</li>
        <li>Enter your passcode</li>
        <li>Tap Reset all settings to confirm.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Solution 7: Erase all content and settings</h4>
      <p>A factory reset is another thing for you to try, but first, create a backup because the settings will go to factory defaults and data will be erased. When you complete this, do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Navigate to Settings</li>
        <li>Tap General</li>
        <li>Tap Reset</li>
        <li>Choose Erase all content and settings option</li>
        <li>Enter your passcode</li>
        <li>Tap Erase iPhone to confirm.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When all of it is done, follow the steps to set up your iPhone 11 as a new device.</p>
      <p>If you still experiencing overheating, contact Apple.</p>
