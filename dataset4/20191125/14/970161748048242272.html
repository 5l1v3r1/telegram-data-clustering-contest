      <p>Celebrity Christmas Come Dine With Me has the weirdest line up in store for us this year.</p>
      <p>Drag Race star Courtney Act, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> finalist Debbie McGee, and children’s TV presenters Richard McCourt and Dominic Wood – better known as Dick and Dom – are going to rustle up dinner for each other this Christmas.</p>
      <p>They will be joined by TV personality Charlotte Dawson, daughter of comedian Les Dawson, and internet entertainer Stevo The Madman.</p>
      <p>Like any other CDWM, the celeb version will run for five days from 16 December to 20 December on E4 to get you in the festive mood.</p>
      <p>The random dinner guests will display their culinary skills, or lack of, to each other for a good cause.</p>
      <p>Courtney is hoping to whip up a pink themed vegan menu, Debbie is going to go posh for her black tie evening with some pretty special entertainment – a professional ballroom dance demonstration inside a massive snow globe. Fingers crossed for an appearance from her Strictly partner Giovanni Pernice dropping in to lend a hand.</p>

      <p>We’re also fully expecting Dick and Dom’s evening to be as chaotic as their hilarious TV show In Da Bungalow.</p>
