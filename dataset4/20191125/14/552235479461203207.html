      <h1>Grado's Scottish Cup draw and 5 other times Scottish football made a right balls up of it</h1>
      <h2>The wrestler cut an amusing figure on yesterday's draw as he stood next to Kieron Achara.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:25:28+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:25</time> by <a rel="author">Gabriel McKay</a></address>
      <p>Anyone who has ever watched a draw for one of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/uefa">UEFA</a> or FIFA's tournaments will know just how convoluted the process can be these days.</p>
      <p>Video montages, celebrity guests and vainglorious speeches all serve as a prelude to what is essentially a bit of admin.</p>
      <p>As you might expect though, Scottish football tends to be rather more about the patter when such draws come around.</p>
      <p>Viewers tuning into Sportscene last night would have been treated to the sight of wrestler Grado, who had decided to attend while looking like Jonah Hill's character at the start of 21 Jump Street.</p>
      <p>Alongside the Scot Squad star, whose previous contributions to the cultural zeitgeist include a litter awareness campaign at T in the Park and a brief spell on River City, was Scottish Rocks basketball star Kieron Achara.</p>
      <p>At 6ft 10in he towered above Grado, with the result looking less like a Scottish Cup draw and more like a remake of Twins.</p>
      <p>That's far from the only notable incident we've seen at such draws though, with the below examples taking us through the good, the bad and the ugly.</p>
      <h3>Tunnocks Caramel Wafer Cup</h3>

      <p>When the Tunnocks decided to start sponsoring the Challenge Cup it was, to be honest, inherently funny.</p>
      <p>Renaming a competition the Tunnocks Caramel Wafer Challenge Cup is, frankly, magnificent. It's the specificity that makes it - not just the Tunnocks Cup, the Tunnocks <i>Caramel Wafer</i> Cup.</p>
      <p>Things were already rather amusing, then we saw the first round draw and the studio design.</p>
      <p>A domestic cup competition featuring teams from five different nations and some under-21 teams thrown in for good measure, being drawn on the set of a low-budget rip-off of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.</p>
      <p>Magnificent.</p>
      <h3>Getting the draw entirely wrong</h3>

      <p>For fans reaching a cup-semi final is an exciting time, with supporters watching the draw with baited breath to see who stands between their side and a shot at the trophy.</p>
      <p>For clubs the games being played at Hampden means plenty of negotiation over dates, times, ticket allocations and prices.</p>
      <p>Those were the discussions Hearts and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dundee-united-fc">Dundee United</a> were locked in shortly after the 2007-08 CIS Cup semi-final draw had been made.</p>
      <p>A mere FOUR HOURS after the draw had been made though the SFL informed the clubs that they wouldn't be playing each other after all.</p>
      <p>Scottish Parliament presiding officer Alex Fergusson had mixed up the numbers and called the wrong ties.</p>
      <p>The SFL sheepishly announced that Hearts would be taking on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> and Dundee United facing Aberdeen.</p>
      <p>Dundee United chairman Eddie Thompson said: "It's a total farce. I've spent four hours on the phone with Hearts arranging when the game would be played, where the game would be played and so on.</p>
      <p>"I'd like to know what the SFL have been doing for four hours between 1330 GMT when the draw was made, and 1720 GMT, when they notified us of the mistake.</p>
      <p>"It was a member of the media who contacted me long before I heard from the SFL and I thought he was off his head."</p>

      <p>The daddy of them all - Rod Stewart performing the Scottish Cup draw after a few tinnies.</p>
      <p>In which other country would you get a tanked-up rock star in a cheetah-skin scarf picking out the balls like some sort of ersatz flamingo, before presenting them bleary-eyed to the camera?</p>
      <p>Ever seen Paul McCartney do a cup draw while clearly blootered? No, you haven't. Take that, the FA Cup.</p>

      <p>In the old days you might hear the cup draw on the radio if you were lucky. More likely you'd just read about it in the next day's paper.</p>
      <p>These days modern technology allows proceedings to be beamed all over the world as it's happening - or that's the theory.</p>
      <p>In February 2016 the Scottish Cup quarter-final draw was broadcast live from Hampden Park, on Sky Sports News no less.</p>
      <p>Sadly for the SFA they managed to draw precisely one tie - Dundee United v Celtic - when someone noticed one of the balls was already open.</p>
      <p>A bemused Lubo Moravcik watched on as the draw had to be completely restarted, with Dundee defender Darren O'Dea taking to Twitter to declare: "Just heard if we beat Dumbarton we've got Juventus in the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey".</p>

      <p>Making such an embarrassing mistake in front of so many people must have been embarrassing, and there would be no repeat in September this year.</p>
      <p>Or rather, if there was no-one could have seen it.</p>
      <p>The fourth round draw for the aforementioned Tunnocks Caramel Wafer Cup was to be streamed live on the SPFL's YouTube channel, but technical issues meant the broadcast didn't start until halfway through the draw.</p>
      <p>That left fans of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/arbroath-fc">Arbroath</a> , Elgin City, Glenavon, Partick Thistle, Raith Rovers, Airdrie, Connah's Quay and Clyde with no idea who they were actually playing.</p>

      <p>The draw was eventually made clear to everyone involved, but it somewhat defeated the point of the live stream.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly there were no allegations of the draw being fiddled - though going on previous evidence trying such a complex move would be well beyond the capabilities of those doing the draw in any case.</p>
