      <h1>Let's demand accountability from duty-bearers - Dr Zanetor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:05:20+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:05</time> by <a rel="author">Samuel Akumatey, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Ho, Nov. 25, GNA – Dr Zanetor Agyeman Rawlings, Member of Parliament for Klottey-Korley Constituency in the Greater Accra Region, has called on the citizenry to arm themselves with knowledge to demand accountability from duty-bearers.</p>
      <p>She said every citizen had the right to demand accountability, especially at the local level and charged them to wake up to the responsibility.</p>
      <p>Dr Rawlings was speaking at an orientation and handing over ceremony in Ho for freshers, and executives of the National Democratic Congress’s Tertiary Education Institutions Network (TEIN).</p>
      <p>She said structures were in place to ensure transparency and accountability, but the problem was that citizens' resolve to keep duty-bearers on their toes was at the minimum.</p>
      <p>“You have the right to information, and the right to information with regards to what is happening with our money is there. It is written in law. Please read. Equip yourselves with knowledge. Build your capacity,” she said.</p>
      <p>“You must possess analytical minds, and help share the figures so people can see the true situation on the ground. You should pay attention not only to the budget, but to the unbiased analysis of the budget”.</p>
      <p>Dr. Rawlings said people must understand the concept of social democracy and appreciate its values, adding that decentralisation aligned with the values of the NDC, which had laid “a proper foundation for good governance”.</p>
      <p>She said the youth therefore had a legacy to protect, and commit to efforts towards safeguarding the rights of the citizenry.</p>
      <p>“It’s time to exercise your rights and responsibilities. You owe it to the others who don’t know, and as members of the NDC, if we don’t stand up for those who are being taken for granted, those whose voices are being taken away, then we are failing the people of Ghana,” she added.</p>
      <p>“We have a duty to be a strong force to stand for what is right and what is good. So let’s work together”.</p>
      <p>The MP appealed to TEIN members to contribute their quota to help resource the various groups.</p>
      <p>The event was on the theme “Mobilizing and Equipping the Youth for Victory 2020, the Role of TEIN”.</p>
      <p>Mr Goerge Loh, Vice Chairman of NDC in the Volta Region said a lot must be invested in strengthening the student wing of the Party to deliver, and that the NDC was strengthening relationships and fostering cooperation on campuses for a “stronger and more unified front”.</p>
      <p>He said the NDC gave youth most opportunities to work in government, and asked the students to invest time in helping the Party win back power in 2020.</p>
      <p>Mr Loh said a database of TEIN members would be developed to help “deploy arsenals better”.</p>
      <p>Mr Edem Agbanu, Deputy National Youth Organiser of NDC, said TEIN members, particularly the executives must be bold to defend the Party, and help increase membership, saying “executives who cannot help the Party win power will have their powers taken away”.</p>
      <p>Mr Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, Member of Parliament for North Tongu Constituency, said TEIN members must support constituency and branch executives on outreach programmes towards building a strong and formidable teams.</p>
      <p>He called for unity among members of the Party, and asked them to “create space” for new members.</p>
      <p>The MP also asked members to use social media to unite, inspire people and build a “strong supportive team”.</p>
      <p>Twelve executive members from each TEIN chapter were sworn in.</p>
