      <h1>Elon Musk Explains Why Window Broke On The Cybertruck</h1>
      <h2>Do you believe him?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:15:32+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author">Jared Rosenholtz</a></address>
      <p>No matter if you're a Tesla fan or not, there's no arguing that the reveal event for the all-new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/tesla/cybertruck">Cybertruck</a> could have gone better. Tesla's <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-arrives-with-500-mile-range-and-39900-price-tag">predicted specs for the truck are undeniably great</a> - a $39,900 starting price, a 500-mile max range, and a 0-60 mph time of under three seconds on the fastest model. During the reveal, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wanted to show off one of the Cybertruck's other unique features - supposedly "bulletproof" windows that the company calls 'Armor Glass.'</p>
      <p>Musk invited a Tesla employee on stage to throw a metal ball at the Cybertruck's windows, showing their durability. The metal ball was supposed to bounce right off the window but in a stunning turn of events, it created a huge crack. He then threw the ball at the rear window and just like the front glass, it cracked. Musk was clearly unhappy with the result of the demonstration so the CEO took to Twitter to explain why the window didn't stand up to the ball.</p>

      <p>Twitter user Rod Adib said, "I know the real reason behind the window crack. It's ok Elon, But maybe you should've threw (sic) the ball of (sic) the window before you decided to hit the door with a sledgehammer." Musk responded to Adib's comment to confirm this theory saying, "Yup. Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn't bounce off. Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door. Next time â€¦"</p>
      <p>This seems like a reasonable explanation for why the ball didn't bounce off the window but there's just one issue - why didn't it bounce off the rear window? Before throwing the ball, Tesla demonstrated the toughness of the stainless steel door by hitting it with a sledgehammer, which supposedly broke the base of the front window. But the rear door wasn't hit with a hammer, so why did the window crack?</p>

      <p>In another demonstration of the Cybertruck's abilities, Musk posted a tug-of-war test versus a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/f-150">Ford F-150</a>. Tesla says the Cybertruck can tow up to 14,000 pounds, which is about 600 pounds more than the F-150. Tesla's video shows the Cybertruck pulling the F-150 up a hill in a tug-of-war but like the metal ball demonstration, there is a problem here.</p>
      <p>The video clearly shows the Tesla moving first, meaning the Ford is immediately at a disadvantage for traction. And as the Cybertruck starts pulling the F-150, only the rear wheels spin, so clearly 4WD mode was not active for the test. As with the metal ball best, the tug-of-war video shows the Cybertruck may not be ready for prime time just yet. But that hasn't stopped some 200,000 people <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-orders-come-piling-in-online">slapping down a refundable $100 deposit</a> on the latest piece of Musk wizardry.</p>
