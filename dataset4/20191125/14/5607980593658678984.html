      <h1>MediaTek is developing 5G modems for PCs with Intel chips</h1>

      <p>Taiwanese chip maker MediaTek is probably best known for making processors for smartphones, tablets, and Chromebooks. But this year the company also introduced its <a href="https://liliputing.com/2019/05/mediatek-unveils-a-7nm-arm-cortex-a77-chip-with-an-integrated-5g-modem.html">first smartphone chip with an integrated 5G modem</a>, and now the company has <a href="https://www.mediatek.com/news-events/press-releases/mediatek-and-intel-partner-to-bring-5g-connectivity-to-the-next-generation-of-pcs">announced a partnership with Intel</a> to bring 5G modems to Intel-powered laptop computers.</p>
      <p>At least two major PC makers seem to be on board: Dell and HP are said to be planning to launch Intel/MediaTek laptops. But you’ll have to wait a little while to get your hands on one — rollout isn’t expected to begin until early 2021.</p>

      <p>While MediaTek says its new 5G modems for laptops will be based on the company’s existing Helio M70 5G modem, it seems like it’ll take a little while to adapt that technology into a solution for laptop PCs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-mediatek-partner-deliver-5g-pc/">Intel says</a> it will “define a 5G solution specification focused on deployment in key laptop segments,” and “develop and validate platform-level hardware ans software integration, including OS host drivers,” while MediaTek will be responsible for developing the modem.</p>
      <p>The two companies also then work with <a href="http://www.fibocom.com/">Fibocom</a> to develop M.2 modules.</p>
      <p>This announcements comes after Intel dropped plans to develop its own 5G chips in-house. Partnering with MediaTek could help Intel offer a solution for PC makers at a time when rival chip maker Qualcomm is not only offering 4G and 5G chips, but also whole system-on-a-chip solutions that can power Windows laptops and tablets like the new <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-pro-x/8VDNRP2M6HHC?activetab=overview">Surface Pro X</a>.</p>
