      <p>COLLEGE PARK, Md. -- A man was arrested after he was allegedly found hiding in a woman's bedroom closet, <a href="https://www.wmar2news.com/homepage-showcase/woman-finds-intruder-wearing-towel-in-bedroom-closet-in-college-park">wearing only a towel.</a></p>
      <p>Eric Tata, 24, is charged with fourth-degree burglary, trespassing and trespassing/peeping tom.</p>
      <p>It happened back on November 19, just before 11 p.m. at an apartment in College Park, Maryland.</p>
      <p>The woman told Prince George's County Police she found the intruder in her closet after hearing a noise in the apartment.</p>
      <p>He apparently ran off when the victim screamed, and was no longer there when police arrived.</p>
      <p>The victim was not hurt.</p>
      <p>Investigators were able to identify the suspect as Tata, and found out that he lived at a neighboring apartment.</p>
      <p>Officers went to the apartment, found Tata and arrested him. He has since been released on a $2,500 unsecured bond.</p>
      <p>Police think Tata may have done this to other victims before, and are asking anyone with information to call 301-699-2601.</p>
      <p>It's unclear how he got into the woman's apartment.</p>
