      <p>A 36-year-old man has pleaded guilty to stealing the wallet from a man who was later found dead between Derry's walls and Millennium Forum four years ago.</p>
      <p>Adrian Vasile Aitoneanu, a Romanian national whose address was given as Selway Street in Rotherham, England, was re-arraigned on the day of his trial at Derry Crown Court on a charge of robbing Conall Kerrigan of his wallet and contents on August 23 2015.</p>
      <p>Mr Kerrigan (35) had just returned home from England to Claudy and had planned to set up his own plumbing business.</p>
      <p>He was out celebrating with friends on the night his body was found. At the time police said they did not believe his death was the result of a crime.</p>
      <p>The defendant also pleaded guilty on re-arraignment to stealing an iPhone 6 valued at Â£600 from a woman on the same night.</p>
      <p>Defence barrister Sean Doherty said there was a potential second defendant in the case, also a Romanian man, whose extradition from the Republic was recently approved.</p>
      <p>Mr Doherty said that man had 15 days to appeal the extradition order.</p>
      <p>A barrister for the Public Prosecution Service told Judge Elizabeth McCaffrey that if the extradition went ahead "proceedings here are ready to go".</p>
      <p>Aitoneanu was released on continuing bail until his plea and sentence hearing takes place on January 7.</p>
      <p>Judge McCaffrey ordered a pre-sentence report for that date and also adjourned the case against the man awaiting extradition until December 17.</p>
