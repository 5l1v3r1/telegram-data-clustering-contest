      <h1>Rare Pokemon to return in 2019's final Pokemon GO Community Day</h1>

      <p>Niantic <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/en/post/dec19-cd/">has revealed that the final <i>Pokémon GO</i> Community Day of 2019</a> will offer fans another opportunity to bag those super-duper-elusive Pokemon that appeared during previous Community Day events from 2019 and 2018.<br/><br/>For a short two-day period, 2019's Community Day Pokémon will once again roam the wild, perhaps hanging out at your local church, supermarket or... driving range? Meanwhile, the Community Day Pokémon from 2018 will be available to battle and capture during raid events. If that wasn't enough, then each critter's exclusive "move" can also be re-learned, provided you evolve the character during the event timespan.<br/><br/>Now, I may not be a dedicated <i>Pokémon GO</i> player, but that sounds like a helluva lot of searching, battling, capturing and evolving for a mere two days, so I hope all of you hardcore <i>GO</i> players are able to bag some rare Pokémon in that slim time frame. The event will run from 09:00 until 21:00 on both days, so at least sleeping remains mandatory.<br/><br/>For full details on the Community Day event, the Pokémon available, and any other bonuses, check out <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/en/post/dec19-cd/">the official <i>Pokémon GO</i> website</a>. <i><br/><br/>Pokémon GO</i> is available now on iOS and Android devices.</p>
