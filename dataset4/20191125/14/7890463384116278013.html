      <h1>Football Manager 2020 outsells Shenmue 3 in launch week</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/shenmue-3">Shenmue 3</a> was one of the most highly anticipated games of the year before its launch last week. It was the best-funded videogame Kickstarter campaign ever and went on to receive a generally positive fan reception at launch. However, the long-awaited game has struggled to make much of a dent in the UK physical sales charts, coming in at No. 17 in its debut week.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps it is an unsurprising result, given the Shenmue series’ status as a cult hit rather than being a game with mainstream, blockbuster appeal. What is surprising, however, is that a game that came out on PC and PS4 was beaten by the PC-exclusive <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/football-manager-2020">Football Manager 2020</a>, which debuted at No. 16.</p>
      <p>Obviously, releasing on two platforms rather than one is itself an advantage, but there’s more to it than that. Only physical sales count towards UKIE’s charts – so what the charts actually tell us is that more people bought a boxed copy of Football Manager 2020 than a boxed copy of Shenmue 3, even though the latter came out on PC <i>and </i>PS4, where a greater proportion of players buy physical.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a> returns to No. 1, while <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> keeps its No. 2 spot. Pokemon Sword, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/fifa-20">FIFA 20</a>, and Pokemon Shield round out the top five – but <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/fortnite">Fortnite</a>‘s new Darkfire bundle does manage to sneak into the top 10.</p>
      <p>You can see the full top 10 below via GfK Chart-Track and <a href="https://ukie.org.uk/news/2019/11/%E2%80%98call-duty-modern-warfare%E2%80%99-keeps-jedi-bay-take-back-no1-slot">UKIE</a>.</p>
