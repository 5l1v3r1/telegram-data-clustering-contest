      <p>KYIV -- Vandals have painted large swastikas on a monument of the prominent Jewish author and playwright Sholem Aleichem in Kyiv just days ahead of a summit of regional Jewish leaders in Ukraine.<br/><br/>Worshippers at the Brodskiy Synagogue in central Kyiv found the sculpture in the morning on November 25 vandalized with a large red swastika painted on the body of the monument, which depicts Aleichem standing with a cane in one hand while doffing his hat with the other.</p>
      <p>Foreign Minister Vadym Prystayko denounced the act in a tweet as “disgusting, appalling, and in need of prompt investigation.”</p>
      <p>"The perpetrator(s) <b><a href="https://twitter.com/VPrystaiko/status/1198891300424212480">must be brought to justice,"</a></b> he said.</p>
      <p>The National Police of Ukraine said in a <b><a href="https://kyiv.npu.gov.ua/news/publichna-bezpeka-ta-poryadok/pravooxoronczi-z-yasovuyut-obstavini-poshkodzhennya-pam-yatnika-na-stolichnomu-pechersku/">statement</a></b> that a probe has been launched into what they called "hooliganism."</p>
      <p>Sholem Aleichem, born as Solomon Naumoych Rabynovych in Ukraine in 1859, wrote his works in Yiddish.<br/><br/>His most known and popular book was a series of short stories about Tevye the Dairyman, a pious Jewish milkman living in Tsarist Russia, upon which the musical Fiddler On The Roof was based.<br/><br/>In 1906, Sholem Aleichem emigrated to the West after a series of Jewish pogroms in the southern regions of the then Russian Empire, including Ukraine, and died in New York in 1916 of tuberculosis.<br/><br/>His funeral was considered to be one of the largest in New York City at the time, with some 100,000 mourners attending the farewell ceremony.<br/><br/>Members of the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress (EAJC) and Europea Jewish Parliament (EJP) will gather in Ukraine on November 27 for the Summit of Eurasian Jewry, where they will address a number of issues and call for a peaceful dialogue in resolving conflicts.<br/><br/>The summit will take place in Anatevka, a small village outside of Kyiv named after the fictional hometown of Tevye the Dairyman.</p>
