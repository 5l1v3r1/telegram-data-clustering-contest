      <h1>The Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show Is Officially Over</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:22:48+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://collegecandy.com/author/candidwithconstance/" target="_blank">Constance Kalpakis</a></address>
      <p>And no, it’s not because <u><a href="http://collegecandy.com/tag/rihanna/">Rihanna</a></u> can’t return as musical guest. But at least we can all respectfully eat cake for dinner without feeling guilty this time around.</p>
      <p>Every year, girls from all over the world gawk at The Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show in envy and admiration. Between the iconic outfits, the reveal of the fantasy bra, the unique theme, and entertaining musical performances, the show has become a major annual event and inspiring to girls all over.</p>
      <p>However, there’s been a lot of controversy and issues revolving around the brand for a while. Sales have declined ever since there’s been complaints of lack of body diversity in their merchandise, and despicable comments towards transgender and plus-sized women were made by the chief marketing officer.</p>

      <p>In speak of this, CFO, Stuart Burgdoerfer, had mentioned to <i>Fortune</i> that the show will not be taking place this year in order to “evolve the messaging of [the company], and will be communicating to customers, but nothing similar in magnitude to the fashion show.”</p>
      <p>The first to reveal its cancellation was VS model, Shanina Shaik, who had accidentally let it slip out in an interview this past summer with <i>The Telegraph</i>.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, the Victoria’s Secret show won’t be happening this year. It’s something I’m not used to because every year around this time I’m training like an angel. But I’m sure in the future something will happen, which I’m pretty sure about. I’m sure they’re trying to work on branding and new ways to do the show because it’s the best show in the world.”</p>
