      <p>Mateu Lahoz has been named as the referee for this weekend's top of the table clash between Barcelona and Atletico Madrid at the Wanda Metropolitano.</p>
      <p>League leaders Barça travel to Madrid tied with Real Madrid on 28 points, while Atletico sit fourth with 25 points having played one game more.</p>
      <p>Lahoz was in charge the first time the two sides met at the Wanda, on Oct. 14, 2017. The game ended in a 1-1 draw on that occasion.</p>
      <p>He was also controversially in charge of Barcelona's win over Sevilla in October, when he sent off Ousmane Dembele and Ronald Araujo in the final minutes.</p>
      <p>Dembele was subsequently given a two-game ban for telling the official he was: "Very bad. You are very bad."</p>
      <p>Lahoz will be supported on Sunday by Gonzalez Gonzalez, who will be in charge of VAR operations for the game between two of La Liga's title challengers.</p>
