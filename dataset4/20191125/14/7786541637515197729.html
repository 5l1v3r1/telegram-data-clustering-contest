      <p><b>BERLINÂ (AP)</b> - German officials say they are investigating whether the deaths of 18 porpoises in the Baltic Sea is connected to a navy demining operation earlier this year.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Germany's Defense Ministry said Monday that "so far no direct link has been established" between the detonation of 42 WWII-era mines and the deaths of the endangered marine mammals.</p>
      <p>Frank Faehnrich told reporters that should a link be found "we obviously regret it."</p>
      <p>The mines were blown up in August during a NATO maneuver, after civilian authorities warned they were becoming increasingly unsafe with age.</p>
      <p>Environment Ministry spokesman Stephan Gabriel Haufe said the detonation took place in a marine reserve and that porpoises in the Baltic enjoy "particularly strict protection."</p>
