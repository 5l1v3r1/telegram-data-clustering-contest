      <p>Mississippi residents lined up on Monday to buy <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/lucky-illinois-man-named-gambles-won-lottery-numbers/story?id=40112757">lottery tickets</a> for the first time in the state's history.</p>
      <p>However, only scratch-off <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/bartender-tipped-winning-50000-lottery-ticket/story?id=66613850">tickets</a> were for sale, while jackpots such as the Powerball and Mega Millions games will be available starting Jan. 30, according to the <a href="https://www.mslotteryhome.com/">Mississippi Lottery website</a>.</p>
      <p>Legislation allowing lottery games in Mississippi was passed in 2018. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/north-carolina-man-battling-cancer-wins-200000-lottery/story?id=66567609">Winners</a> can choose to remain anonymous as long as they provide a valid form of identification when claiming their winnings.</p>
      <p>The decision faced strong opposition from churches that wield political power, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/jackpot-lottery-tickets-sale-1st-time-mississippi-67292587">The Associated Press</a> reported.</p>

      <p>Lottery tickets were available in about 1,200 convenience stores on Monday, according to AP.</p>
      <p>The first $80 million in proceeds the lottery generates every year will go to state infrastructure, and any revenue after that will go to state education, according to the Mississippi Lottery website.</p>
      <p>The state had generated $300,000 in ticket sales in the first two hours after the scratch-offs became available, AP reported.</p>
      <p>Unlike other states, which sell lottery tickets as cash-only purchases, Mississippi allows people to use a credit or debit card without an additional fee, ABC Jackson, Mississippi, affiliate <a href="https://www.wapt.com/article/mississippi-lottery-will-begin-selling-tickets-nov-25/29476045">WAPT</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada and Utah are the five remaining states without lotteries.</p>
