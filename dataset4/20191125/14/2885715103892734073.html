      <p>The first semester examinations of Delhi University (DU)’s School Of Open Learning (SOL) have been postponed and now will be held along with the second-semester tests in May-June, following a Delhi High Court order.</p>
      <p>The first semester examinations were supposed to be held in November-December. A notification was issued by SOL on Monday after the Delhi High Court order on November 21.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The HC had asked the administration to postpone the examination while hearing a plea by students which asked for the semester system be implemented from next year. The institute has also formed a committee to examine the grievances of the students and to suggest remedies.</p>
      <p>The students have been agitating against the implementation of the Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) in SOL after the varsity took a decision in August.</p>
      <p>Under the CBCS, the school of open learning was asked to switch from annual mode to semester mode to bring it on par with other DU colleges.</p>
      <p>Harish Gautam, a third-year student of SOL and a member of Krantikari Yuva Sangathan (KYS), welcomed the notification.</p>
      <p>The KYS has been a frontrunner in demanding that the semester mode be implemented from next year to allow more time for students to get acquainted with the system.</p>
