      <p>A Toyota worker who called in sick so he could take his son to see The Wiggles was sacked after a colleague grassed him up.</p>
      <p>Sean Mamo called in saying he couldn’t make it into the dealership in Yarrawonga, northern Victoria, because his boy wasn’t well.</p>
      <p>But he actually had a pair of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tickets/">tickets</a> for them both to see The Wiggles in concert, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7721767/Father-faked-sick-day-son-Wiggles-sacked-boss-saw-photo-them.html">MailOnline</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Mr Mamo was rumbled when a picture of them both enjoying the gig posted to social media was shown to general manager Steven Zandt.</p>
      <p>When quizzed by the owner he initially denied claiming personal leave, but admitted he’d gone to the concert when confronted with the picture.</p>

      <p>Mr Mamo said he didn’t ask for a day’s annual leave because he didn’t think he would get it and he failed to apologise after being caught out.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/no-way-to-wiggle-out-of-sacking/news-story/ab0537b0f7893907e5d638654808495a">The Australian</a> reported that the incident, combined with his past poor performance, led the company to lose trust in Mr Mamo and give him the boot.</p>
      <p>Mr Mamo lodged a claim for unfair dismissal with the Fair Work Commission, claiming the sick day was not enough to cost him his job.</p>
      <p>But the application was dismissed by president Alan Coleman, who said Mr Mamo had been ‘dishonest’ in seeking ‘to obtain financial advantage by deception’ and ‘asserting a legitimate right to be absent from work when none in fact exists’.</p>
      <p>Mr Colman ruled the bogus sick day was ‘of sufficient gravity’ for him to be fired.</p>
      <p>Given all evidence, he concluded that dismissal was neither harsh, unjust nor unreasonable and ultimately ‘not unfair’.</p>
