      <p>During the hearing before Mr Justice Edis, he admitted conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration between May 1 2018 and October 24 2019.</p>
      <p>The charge states that he plotted with others to do "an act or series of acts which facilitated the commission of a breach of immigration law by various persons".</p>
      <p>He also admitted acquiring criminal property - namely cash - on the same dates.</p>
      <p>Robinson, who is known as Mo, faces 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration between December 1, 2018 and October 24, 2019.</p>
      <p>The defendant, of Laurel Drive in Craigavon in Northern Ireland, was not asked to enter pleas to other charges, including the 39 counts of manslaughter.</p>
      <p>He is also charged with conspiracy to commit human trafficking offences between May 1, 2018 and October 24, 2019.</p>
