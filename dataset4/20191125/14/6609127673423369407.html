        <b>A MURDER suspect allegedly claimed he had “stabbed the f*** out” of a dad killed outside his mum's pub.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Craig Corrall was said to have made the remark to a friend following the death of Owen Hassan in November 2018.</p>

      <p>Jurors heard the 39 year-old also apparently stated he had “done something bad”.</p>
      <p>Corrall and David Callaghan, 30, are on trial where they deny the murder of Mr Hassan.</p>
      <p>The 30 year-old was found injured outside the Old Stag Inn bar in Glasgow's Pollokshaws, which was run by his mum Ann Marie Lynch.</p>
      <p>Corrall's former friend Stephen Ward today gave evidence at the High Court in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>The 24 year-old – who also knew Mr Hassan – recalled a visit to the home of Corrall's dad.</p>
      <p>Mr Ward and Corrall had a chat that evening.</p>

      <p>Mr Ward claimed Corrall told him he had been “involved” in the death.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Lynsey MacDonald asked: “What did he say about his involvement?”</p>
      <p>The witness: “That he had done something bad.”</p>
      <p>Mr Ward said he quizzed Corrall on what he had done.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He told the jury: “He said that he had stabbed the f*** out of somebody.”</p>
      <p>Miss MacDonald asked did he say who the person was.</p>

      <p>The witness: “Owen Hassan. He informed me where it had taken place. He said that it was a very short distance from the Old Stag Inn in Pollokshaws.”</p>
      <p>The prosecutor: “At the time, did you know the details of where Owen Hassan had died?”</p>
      <p>Mr Ward: “I had only seen it on the news.”</p>
      <p>He added that Corrall did not give him further “particular details”, but apparently claimed “another person” was with him.</p>
      <p>The witness told the trial he had been friends with Corrall, but stopped “about a year ago”.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors claim Mr Hassan was chased, seized by the body and the repeatedly struck with knives or machetes.</p>
      <p>Corrall's QC Thomas Ross later quizzed Mr Ward on the alleged conversation.</p>
      <p>Mr Ross: "What I am getting at is that you are a liar."</p>
      <p>The witness: "No."</p>
      <p>The QC said Mr Ward had only ever been at Corrall's dad's home once and that was on Christmas Day 2017.</p>
      <p>Mr Ross also put to him: "So, out of the blue, Craig Corrall decides to unburden himself with this information?"</p>
      <p>Mr Ward: "Correct. What reason have I got to lie? You have not got a reason for it."</p>
      <p>The advocate earlier said the witness had given a statement after getting drunk and being held by police.</p>
      <p>Mr Ross: "You tried to buy yourself out by making up this admission from Craig Corrall?"</p>
      <p>Mr Ward: "Nonsense."</p>
      <p>Jurors were later read out facts agreed by the prosecution and the defence legal teams.</p>
      <p>This included information on Mr Hassan's injuries.</p>
      <p>He suffered a series of wounds - one of which pierced his heart.</p>
      <p>The trial, before Lord Woolman, continues.</p>
