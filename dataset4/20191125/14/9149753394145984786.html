      <h1>Save £60 on the HyperX Cloud Revolver S Dolby 7.1 gaming headset</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:49:53+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/author/tom-senior/" target="_blank">Tom Senior</a></address>
      <p>Prices are dropping fast when it comes to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday PC gaming deals</a>. This is a good price for a surround sound headset, and from one of our favourite gaming headset brands too. The Cloud Revolver is the premium tier of the HyperX line, which means you get an advanced USB audio control box with a built-in sound card, along with a superior microphone. It also comes in smooth gunmetal grey.</p>
      <p>According to HyperX this set features a "studio-grade sound stage that excels in FPS and open-environment settings". The Dolby surround sound ought to let you pinpoint player positions with decent accuracy. The surround sound is delivered by "next-gen" 50mm directional drivers. Yes, technically true, but we can safely say that it sounds great when you actually use it.</p>
      <p>It's compatible with most gaming and TV devices too. If you want to move to the living room this will happily plug into an Xbox or PS4 controller, though you'll likely lose the use of the USB sound card dongle, and the 7.1 sound.</p>
      <p>For more options, be sure to check out our rolling, regularly updated list of the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/black-friday-gaming-headset-deals-2019/">best Black Friday headset deals</a>. There will likely be loads more as we head towards Black Friday itself.</p>
