      <h1>Samsung hint they are responsible for PlayStation 5’s incredibly fast loading speed</h1>

      <p>Samsung have hinted strongly that they are responsible for PlayStation 5’s rather incredible loading speed. During the recent Samsung SSD forum in Tokyo the company announced a new NVMe SSD, or Non-Volatile Memory Express Solid State Drive, which they said will be an integral component on a new game console released in 2020. Just to add fuel o the fire, a slide during their presentation included a PlayStation DualShock controller.</p>

      <p>The drive is said to boast bandwidth higher than any drive which is currently available to PC owners with Samsung claiming that Monster Hunter, that currently takes 38 seconds to load on a console, will launch in less than 13 seconds on the new NVMe SSD.</p>

      <p>A few days ago there were reports of the price and release date of the PlayStation 5 leaking. The release date was said to be November 2020 with a price of $499, with a 2TB SSD and Gran Turismo 7 as a launch game. However, the source for all these rumours is 4Chan so they’re almost certainly a load of old tosh, albeit very obvious guesses.</p>
