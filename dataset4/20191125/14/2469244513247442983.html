      <p>A jealous husband battered his terrified wife about the head with a hammer while allegedly telling her 'you are going to die now'.</p>
      <p>Michael Sparkes thought his wife was about to leave him and attacked her in the kitchen of their flat in the centre of Exeter as she was making a late night microwave meal.</p>
      <p>He took a hammer from a tool drawer and hit her eight to ten times before she grabbed the weapon off him, a jury at Exeter Crown Court was told.</p>
      <p>Neighbours who heard her screams had already alerted police, who found her with two wounds to the back of her head, one to her cheek, and several more to her arms, which he had used to protect herself.</p>
      <p>She needed treatment at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital to glue the worst injuries, but a scan showed she had not suffered a fractures skull or any brain injury.</p>
      <p>Sparkes, aged 51, of Silver Lane, Exeter, denies wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm but admits the lesser offence of wounding.</p>
      <p>Judge Peter Johnson has told the jury that the only issue in the case is whether he intended to cause his wife really serious injury when he carried out the attack.</p>
      <p>Mr Tom Bradnock, prosecuting, said Sparkes and his wife have been a couple for 19 years and married since 2004 but their relationship was under strain at the time of the attack in June this year.</p>
      <p>She had felt he had become jealous and controlling in the days before the incident.</p>
      <p>On the night of June 3, they watched television together at home with him, before having an apparently amicable discussion about their relationship.</p>
      <p>She was making a microwave meal in the kitchen shortly after midnight when her husband followed her in and attacked her without warning.</p>
      <p>Mr Bradnock said:"He said something along the lines of 'you're going to leave me' and was muttering under his breath. He went to a drawer which was used to keep DIY equipment and pulled out a hammer.</p>
      <p>"He raised it above his head and as she turned to face him, he said 'you are going to f***ing die now' in an aggressive voice. She says his eyes were full of anger and he lunged towards her with the hammer.</p>
      <p>"He hit her on the top of the head. She put her hand up to protect herself and fell to the floor. She recalls that he hit her again in the same place and she began bleeding.</p>
      <p>"There was blood on the wall, the skirting board and the fridge and she was afraid she was going to die. She says he came at her again and again with the hammer.</p>
      <p>"She is a little bigger than him and was able to grab his wrist to try to stop him from hitting her. She tried to push him away. We say it was a violent, frenzied and unprovoked attack."</p>
      <p>The attack ended when a girl who was in the flat came into the kitchen and told him to stop. The police arrived very shortly afterwards and arrested him.</p>
      <p>He told police he had used the hammer to attack his wife but denied telling her she was going to die and said he had not hit her as hard as he could have done and did not intend to hurt her really badly.</p>
