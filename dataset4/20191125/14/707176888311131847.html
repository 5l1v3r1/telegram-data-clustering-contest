      <h1>General Electric names Maersk executive as chief financial officer</h1>
      <h2>Carolina Dybeck Happe is second big outside appointment following Larry Culp as CEO</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:34:56+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:34</time> by <a rel="author">Peter Wells, Gregory Meyer</a></address>
      <p>General Electric has named an executive of shipping group AP Moller-Maersk as its new chief financial officer, in the second big appointment of an outsider in just over a year as the US industrial group attempts to revive itself.</p>
      <p>Carolina Dybeck Happe, who has been CFO of Denmark-based Maersk for 10 months, will join Larry Culp, appointed as chairman and chief executive in October last year, at GE in early 2020.</p>
      <p>It is the first time the conglomerate has appointed outsiders to the two key executive positions in its 127-year history.</p>
      <p>Ms Dybeck Happe takes over from Jamie Miller, who joined GE in 2008 and became its first female CFO two years ago. Ms Miller said in the summer that she would step aside as <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d4020278-25b7-11e9-b329-c7e6ceb5ffdf">Mr Culp</a> reshapes senior management ranks.</p>
      <p>Ms Dybeck Happe’s appointment underscores GE’s efforts to bring in outside help and experience to help the group recover from financial and business mis-steps. The company’s accounting remains under investigation by the US Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
      <p>Mr Culp became the first chief executive in the conglomerate’s history not to have risen through its ranks when he took the reins 13 months ago. He has since slashed the company’s dividend and delivered swingeing changes to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/349014da-e8ff-11e9-a240-3b065ef5fc55">retiree pensions</a> in an effort to improve <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ddd1b9da-fb02-11e9-98fd-4d6c20050229">cash flow</a> and reduce its pension deficit and debt pile.</p>
      <p>“Carolina is a proven global CFO with a superior record of delivering results and creating value,” Mr Culp said on Monday.</p>
      <p>GE’s accounting team has also taken on outside help in the past 18 months, with Thomas Timko taking on the mantle of chief accounting officer, having held the same role at General Motors.</p>
      <p>Last December, GE also started a tender process for the appointment of an independent auditor, which could result in the replacement of longtime accounting firm KPMG.</p>
      <p>Analysts at Barclays said in a note on Monday that the extent of the management and board level changes that had taken place during the past 12 to 18 months “bode well for a possible turnround in the company’s culture, and eventually, in the operations”.</p>
      <p>Nigel Coe, analyst at Wolfe Research, called Ms Dybeck Happe a “heavyweight appointment” who had strong experience in cost control at global companies. Before joining Maersk in January, Ms Dybeck Happe had served for several years as CFO of Assa Abloy, a Stockholm-based maker of locks, doors and gates.</p>
      <p>GE shares rose 1 per cent to $11.65 by lunchtime in New York.</p>
      <p>Ms Dybeck Happe’s departure from Maersk is the latest leadership change at the container shipping and ports company, which has been feeling the strain from global trade wars. Soren Toft, the company’s chief operating officer, resigned this month and has been appointed chief executive of Mediterranean Shipping Company.</p>
