      <h1>Jose Mourinho wants his Manchester United top target at Tottenham as he plots key signing</h1>
      <h2>The Portuguese has discussed a sporting director role with key ally Luis Campos.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:41:40+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:41</time> by <a rel="author">Duncan Castles, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/duncan-castles/</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho is working to bring Luis Campos to Tottenham Hotspur to aid in ending the London club's 11-year wait for major silverware. The <i><b>Daily Record</b> </i>understands that Tottenham's newly installed manager – who began his reign with Saturday's 3-2 victory at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham United</a> – has asked Campos if he would be interested in filling the club's vacant technical director role. <br/><br/>Campos has established a reputation as one of the game's most accomplished recruitment specialists, building the AS Monaco squad that took the 2016-17 French title off Paris Saint-Germain, then restructuring Lille into Ligue 1 runners-up. Signings from which those two clubs generated huge profits include Fabinho, Thomas Lemar, Benjamin Mendy, Nicolas Pepe, Bernardo Silva and Kylian Mbappe, the most expensive teenager in the history of the game. <br/><br/>Campos worked for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho">Mourinho</a> at Real Madrid and remains a trusted confidant and friend, hosting his fellow Portuguese at Lille matches following his dismissal as Manchester United manager last December. Mourinho recommended Campos to United when Ed Woodward drew up plans to appoints the club's first director of football last year, but the executive vice-chairman refused to interview his then manager's candidate for the role.</p>

      <p>Although Daniel Levy was one of English football's early champions of the technical director post, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> are currently without one. Franco Baldini formally exited the position in September 2015 after finding Mauricio Pochettino difficult to work with. Paul Mitchell also failed to survive the Argentine's period as manager, resigning as Head of Recruitment and Analysis in February 2018. <br/><br/>Campos has a long standing interest in working at an elite Premier League club and would like to partner Mourinho again. First, however, he would want to assess Levy's thoughts on the proposal and the dimension of any role at Tottenham before making a decision. Campos is both well regarded and well remunerated at Lille, and turned down an offer to replace Monchi at AS Roma last summer in order to continue with French club. <br/><br/>"Luis is 200 per cent invested in the project and I don't see a 1000th of a wish to look elsewhere,” said Lille coach Christophe Galtier last week. “We're close and looking forward." <br/><br/>Mourinho has already added two members of Lille's technical team to his Tottenham staff, hiring assistant coach Joao Sacramento and goalkeeping coach Nuno Santos on Tuesday. Sacramento is a protege of Campos, who employed the young Portuguese as a tactical analyst at both Monaco and Lille before deploying the then-28-year-old as an interim replacement to Marcelo Bielsa in 2017. <br/><br/>Sacramento's selection as assistant offers echoes of the hugely successful coaching relationship Mourinho developed with Rui Faria at Uniao Leiria, FC Porto, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> , Internazionale, Real Madrid and United. Like Mourinho and Sacramento, academically trained, Faria was replaced at Old Trafford by two inexperienced coaches in Kieran McKenna and Michael Carrick, plus Italian fitness specialist Stefano Rapetti.</p>
