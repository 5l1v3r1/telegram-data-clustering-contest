      <h1>Maha crisis: Of horse trading, a stable flipping, and on-the-run jockey</h1>
      <h2>The Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress combine had moved the top court challenging Devendra Fadnavis being sworn in as the state's Chief Minister</h2>

      <p>The high-voltage hearing in the Supreme Court on Monday over the government formation crisis in Maharashtra witnessed a sharp exchange of words between the two sides on the issue of horse trading.</p>
      <p>"This is not a case of horse trading, but a case of one entire stable going the other way," Solicitor General Tushar Mehta remarked during the arguments on the numbers game in the state's Assembly.</p>
      <p>Senior advocate Kapil Sibal took note of the jibe and retorted: "The stable is still there, only the jockey (Ajit Pawar) has run away."<br/><br/>Mehta then took another dig that there was an agreement to file one petition by the combine but too many counsel -- Sibal, A M Singhvi and others -- were appearing in the case.</p>
      <p>"The three parties can't even agree to field a common counsel," he said on a lighter note before a bench comprising Justices N V Ramana, Ashok Bhushan and Sanjiv Khanna.</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress combine has moved the top court challenging Devendra Fadnavis being sworn in as the state's Chief Minister.</p>
      <p>While Mehta was representing the Secretary to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and Maharashtra Government, Sibal was appearing for the Shiv Sena.</p>
