      <h1>Charles Schwab to buy rival TD Ameritrade in $26B stock deal</h1>

      <p>Charles Schwab announced plans Monday to buy its rival TD Ameritrade for about $26 billion in a deal that will create a colossal discount brokerage.</p>
      <p>The combined company will boast 24 million brokerage accounts with more than $5 trillion in client assets after the all-stock acquisition closes in the second half of next year, the two firms said.</p>
      <p>“We believe the combination of our two great companies positions us to be competing and winning in the investment services business for the long run — the very long run,” Schwab President and CEO Walt Bettinger said in a statement.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/23/charles-schwab-td-ameritrade-deal-would-show-fallacy-of-free-trade/">Reports emerged</a> last week that the two largest publicly traded discount brokerages would unite after scrapping commission fees for online trades, a move that shook up the industry and put pressure on the companies’ stock prices.</p>
      <p>Ameritrade shares were up 3.8 percent in premarket trading Monday morning, while Schwab’s were down 0.1 percent.</p>
      <p>Both companies’ boards of directors have unanimously approved the purchase, which will give TD Ameritrade stockholders 1.0837 Schwab shares for every Ameritrade share, the companies said.</p>
      <p>TD Bank — which currently owns more than 40 percent of Ameritrade — will end up with a roughly 13 percent stake in the merged company, according to a press release. Ameritrade’s other stockholders will own about 18 percent, while Schwab’s existing shareholders will have a 69 percent majority, the firms said.</p>
      <p>The combined company will eventually be headquartered at Schwab’s new campus in Westlake, Texas, northwest of Dallas. TD Ameritrade has also suspended its search for a chief executive and named Stephen Boyle interim president and CEO.</p>
      <p>The one-time executive vice president and chief financial officer will guide the Nebraska-based company through its integration with San Francisco-based Schwab, which is expected to take 18 to 36 months after the deal closes, the firms said.</p>
      <p>“Partnering with Schwab on this transformative opportunity makes the right strategic and financial sense for TD Ameritrade,” Boyle said in a statement. “… We can continue to challenge the status quo, pooling our resources and expertise to transform lives — and investing — and deliver sustainable, long-term value to our many stakeholders.”</p>
