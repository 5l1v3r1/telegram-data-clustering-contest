        <b>Director General of the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ), Dr Wayne Henry, has indicated that persons falling within the country’s working-age range of 15 to 64 years now stand at 69.7 per cent of the overall population of 2.9 million.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Henry says this represents the largest figure ever attained in Jamaica’s history and creates a window of opportunity for the country, often referred to as a demographic dividend.</p>
      <p>“The demographic dividend is the economic growth potential that can result from shifts in a population’s age structure, mainly when the share of the working-age population is disproportionately larger than the dependent population… that is, persons 14 years and younger as well as those 65 years and older,” he outlined.</p>
      <p>Henry was speaking at the PIOJ’s quarterly briefing at the Institute’s head office in New Kingston on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>He noted that an increase in the working-age population, relative to dependents, provides Jamaica with a “tremendous opportunity” to boost economic growth.</p>
      <p>This, he said, through increased labour force participation and employment, particularly for groups deemed typically under-represented such as youth, women and persons with disabilities; increased allocation of resources towards savings rather than consumption, as the dependency ratio falls, thereby facilitating investments and growth; and human capital development through the provision of more resources towards strengthening education and health outcomes, “which will contribute to the increased productivity of the labour force”.</p>
