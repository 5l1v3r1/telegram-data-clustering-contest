      <p>Kumasi, Nov. 25, GNA – Mr Joseph Kwabena Onyinah, former Ashanti Regional Director of Education, has urged heads of senior high schools to attach greater importance to the moral training of students since that was key to academic excellence.</p>
      <p>He said preparing the students adequately to observe high moral values would not only help the youth to cultivate positive attitudes towards life, but would also help them to appreciate God’s creation and respect for the environment.</p>
      <p>Mr Onyinah was speaking at the launch of the 40th Anniversary celebration of the Association of Catholic Heads of Higher Institutions (ACHHI) in Kumasi.</p>
      <p>The Association was formed 39 years ago to bring all heads of Catholic higher institutions together to promote holistic quality education through Christian principles.</p>
      <p>Mr Onyinah called for unity among members and advised them to focus on helping students to develop critical thinking skills, while improving standards of education in the country.</p>
      <p>Reverend Father Nicholas Apetorgbor, the National President of the Association, said it would continue to partner with the Catholic Church and the Ghana Education Service to provide quality education to students.</p>
