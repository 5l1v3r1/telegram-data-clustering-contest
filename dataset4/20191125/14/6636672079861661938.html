        <b>“They have it all – Money, Technology, Vision &amp; Cook!” tweeted President Trump recently revealing that he’d asked Tim Cook to help out with 5G infrastructure.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Leaving aside what President Trump would probably regard as the insignificant detail that Apple has never made telecoms infrastructure, one has to ask: What could Apple do?</p>
      <p>Well he could take up the offer of Huawei’s Ren  Zhengfei and license Huawei’s technology and manufacturing know-how to build Apple-branded 5G switchgear in the USA.</p>
      <p>That approach might be exactly what President Trump is so keen to avoid – having anything Huawei-ish in the US telecoms network.</p>
      <p>Or Tim might get together with his new friend Steve of San Diego to try and lash something up. Since President Trump saved Steve’s ass from the predatory attentions of Broadcom, President Trump might feel Steve owes him a quid pro quo. Apparently President Trump goes in for quid pro quos.</p>
      <p>Failing Steve, there must be dozens of Americans who can design 5G base-stations while Apple has a procurement machine which could source the components cost-effectively and contacts with assemblers who could put it all together.</p>
      <p>When he first came to power in 2017, President Trump suggested that Uncle Sam should build the nation’s 5G network and the telcos should rent capacity off it.</p>
      <p>The telcos lobbied against it furiously and the idea was dropped.</p>
      <p>But now, with Huawei hors de combat, and a President who wants as much as possible of everything used in America to be manufactured in America, there could be a chance to resurrect that aspiration.</p>
      <p>This is not, actually, a bad idea.</p>
