      <h1>Dow's 11-Month Rally Is About to Welcome Back Forgotten Investors</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>The Dow, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq all rose to kick off the holiday-shortened trading week.</li>
        <li>The stock market has boomed in 2019, but average investors have mostly sat the rally out.</li>
        <li>JP Morgan says that’s about to change.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Dow ratcheted higher on Monday, erasing last week’s losses and pushing the stock market back toward all-time highs.</p>
      <p>As Wall Street debates whether the rally will hold, investment bank JP Morgan says that an investor class who went AWOL in 2019 will return to equities with a vengeance in 2020.</p>
      <h3>Dow Presses Toward All-Time High</h3>
      <p>The US stock market’s three primary indices took a collective step forward on Monday.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.ccn.com/dow-jones-price">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> bounced 89.29 points or 0.32%, lifting the index to 27,964.91.</p>

      <p>The S&amp;P 500 rose 13.22 points or 0.43% to 3,123.74. Ten of 11 primary sectors reported gains, led by technology’s 0.78% surge. Only energy traded in the red, losing 0.25% as the price of oil fell.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq secured the best performance, jumping 58.29 points or 0.68% to 8,578.18.</p>
      <h3>Skeptical Investors Are About to Dive Back Into the Stock Market</h3>
      <p>The stock market has raced higher this year, but for the most part, <a href="https://www.ccn.com/investors-flee-stocks-sp500-dow-smash-records/">ordinary investors haven’t been the ones in the driver’s seat</a>. Retail buyers have navigated the markets with extreme caution, <a href="https://www.ccn.com/dow-futures-crash-moodys-16-fatal-recession-triggers/">fearing a recession</a> and remaining skeptical about the US-China trade deal.</p>
      <p>As the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones speed toward one of their best years since the financial crisis, investors are tiring of missing out on the fun. According to JP Morgan, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-great-rotation-will-arrive-in-2020-and-bring-another-strong-year-for-stocks-jp-morgan-says-2019-11-25?mod=home-page">2020 will usher in a “great rotation”</a> in which retail buyers begin abandoning cautious investments in bond funds in favor of equities.</p>

      <p>The investment bank wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>Given this year proved to be a strong year for equity markets, helped by institutional investors, then we should see retail investors responding to this year’s equity market strength by turning [into] big buyers of equity funds in 2020. This suggests 2020 could be another strong year for equities driven by retail rather than institutional investors.</blockquote>
      <p>Retail’s return comes at a pivotal time for the US stock market. While institutional investors had stayed the course – and reaped the rewards – the absence of ordinary investors had created a drag on equities.</p>
      <p>Filling the void have been the public companies themselves, who have been <a href="https://www.ccn.com/crucial-stock-market-catalyst-is-plummeting-as-rally-enters-2nd-decade/">gobbling up their shares on the open market</a> at a record pace. But the buyback rate has begun to wane heading toward the year’s close, and Goldman Sachs predicts that it will continue to edge lower in 2020.</p>
