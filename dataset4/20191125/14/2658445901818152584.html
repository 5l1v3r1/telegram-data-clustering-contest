      <p>A 34-year-old woman, Chineye Nwakwo, on Monday, appeared before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly selling her one-day-old female baby for N300, 000.</p>
      <p>The alleged buyer, Happiness Bini, 49, who was arraigned alongside the defendant, was charged with unlawful adoption of baby.</p>
      <p>The duo, whose residential addresses were not given, are facing a three-count-charge of conspiracy, child trafficking and unlawful adoption.</p>
      <p>They, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor, ASP Ezekiel Ayorinde, told the court that that defendants committed the offences on Oct. 4, at 10:00p.m. at No. 10 Oki Lane, Sari Iganmu, Orile, Lagos State.</p>
      <p>According to him, the duo conspired to engage in child trafficking.</p>
      <p>Ayorinde told the court that the arrest of the duo followed information received by the police that Bini was in possession of a newborn suspected to have been stolen.</p>
