      <h1>Bizarre Huawei Devialet speaker looks like cross between Mac Pro and HomePod</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:16:53+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/benlovejoy/" target="_blank">Ben Lovejoy</a></address>
      <p>A bizarre Huawei Devialet partnership has resulted in the Sound X, a smart speaker that looks like the love child of a trashcan <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> and a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/homepod/">HomePod</a>…</p>
      <p>Huawei emulating Apple designs is nothing new. We’ve previously seen it produce <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/06/27/compared-huawei-matebook-x-pro-vs-macbook-pro-should-apple-fans-be-jealous/">a MacBook lookalike</a>, the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Dh2zIc">MateBook</a>; <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/03/28/huawei-freebuds-apple-airpods/">not just one</a> but two generations <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/06/airpods-clones/">of AirPods clones</a>; and an <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/01/matepad-pro/">iPad Pro with Smart Keyboard clone</a>.</p>
      <p>The company also has form when it comes to smart speakers. Its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/26/huawei-smart-speaker-homepod-clone/">previous AI Speaker</a> looked almost exactly like someone had slotted an Amazon <a href="https://amzn.to/2DdBUMr">Echo Dot</a> into the top of a HomePod.</p>
      <p>The latest model, the <a href="https://chinese.engadget.com/2019/11/25/sound-x-devialet-speaker/?guccounter=1">Sound X</a>, looks rather like a trashcan Mac Pro on the top half and a HomePod on the bottom half.</p>
      <p>So far, nothing too surprising. But slightly more surprising is that high-end French audio company Devialet has partnered with Huawei on the new device.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/25/huawei-devialet-sound-x-speaker/"><i>Engadget</i></a> reports.</p>
      <blockquote>Huawei has unveiled the Sound X, a smart speaker it build in conjunction with bespoke French HiFi company Devialet. On top of the premium look, it packs a 60 watt double subwoofer and 360-degree sound, along with Devialet’s speaker active matching (SAM) that eliminates distortion and push-push woofer vibration-cancelling tech.</blockquote>
      <p>Devialet is the company behind <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2015/10/12/devialet-phantom-review/">the $2000 Phantom</a>, a Bluetooth speaker which aims to replace your hi-fi, so pairing up with a Chinese company on a $285 speaker is a little odd.</p>
      <p>Then again, as <i>Engadget</i> notes, it’s not the first time we’ve seen an unlikely partnership from Devialet.</p>
      <blockquote>Devialet said the Sound X represents its “first partnership in Asia,” and noted that China is its “second-largest region worldwide in terms of sales.” The company has done a number of alliances elsewhere, however, including a surround sound <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/07/27/sky-soundbox-tv-speaker-devialet/">TV speaker</a> for Sky, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/07/altice-amplify-smart-speaker/">Altice Amplify</a> smart speaker from Altice USA, Renault’s crazy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/13/renault-symbioz-concept-ev-vr-impressions/">Symbioz</a> self-driving car and an unusual <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/02/23/freebox-delta-set-top-box-devialet-speakers-impressions/">set-top box</a> with internet provider Free in France.</blockquote>
      <p>The Sound X will be sold only in China.</p>
