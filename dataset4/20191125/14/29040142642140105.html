      <ul>
        <li>Xiaomi has teased the launch of the Mi Note 10 in India.</li>
        <li>The Mi Note 10 was launched in Europe earlier this month and is the first phone to feature a 108MP primary camera.</li>
        <li>It also offers a 6.47-inch FHD+ AMOLED display, Snapdragon 730G chipset, and a massive 5,260mAh battery with 30W fast charging.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Earlier this month, Xiaomi launched its first smartphone with a 108MP main camera in China, dubbed <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomi-mi-cc9-pro-here-108mp-penta-camera-setup-massive-5260mah-battery">Mi CC9 Pro</a>. Shortly after its launch in China, the smartphone made its debut as the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomi-mi-note-10-preview">Mi Note 10</a> in Europe. Now, Xiaomi has started teasing the launch of the smartphone in India.</p>

      <p>Xiaomi India has confirmed in a tweet that a new smartphone with a 108MP camera is coming to the Indian market soon, clearly hinting at the Mi Note 10. If the folks at <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/mi-note-10-108mp-phone-india-launch-plans-exclusive/"><i>91Mobiles</i></a> are to be believed, the Mi Note 10 will not be only 108MP camera phone that Xiaomi will bring to India soon. The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomis-mi-mix-alpha-has-crazy-wraparound-display-108mp-camera">Mi Mix Alpha</a> will apparently be launched in country as well, although it will only be available in limited quantities.</p>
      <p>While the Mi Note 10 may not be a flagship-grade phone, it is still extremely impressive in the camera department. In addition to the 108MP primary sensor with 4-axis OIS, the phone has a 20MP ultra wide-angle lens, 12MP portrait lens with 2x optical zoom, 5MP telephoto lens with 10x hybrid zoom, and a 2MP macro lens.</p>
      <p>The rest of the spec sheet isn't too shabby either. It runs on an 8nm Snapdragon 730G processor, paired with 6GB of RAM and 128GB storage. You also get a large 6.47-inch AMOLED display with FHD+ resolution and an in-display fingerprint sensor. For selfies, the Mi Note 10 has a 32MP camera housed within the waterdrop notch at the top of the display. Battery life is another area where the phone is extremely impressive, thanks to a massive 5,260mAh cell with 30W fast charging.</p>
