      <h1>Pique: President of Barça? Right now I'm really having fun with the tennis</h1>
      <h2>The Barcelona defender evaluated the success of this week's Davis Cup, won by Spain</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:54:08+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:54</time> by <a rel="author">SPORT.es</a></address>
      <p>Gerard Pique says he's delighted with how the Davis Cup has gone this week, with the competition ending on Sunday when a Rafa Nadal-inspired Spain beat Canada in the final.</p>
      <p>Pique's company Kosmos organised the tournament, which took place in Madrid, and the Barcelona defender was present throughout the week to oversee how everything panned out.</p>
      <p>"We're delighted with how everything went and above all with the final, which Spain won," he told Onda Cero. "There are things which need to be improved, like the times of the games, which has an easy solution in the form of adding another court and changing the times a little bit."</p>
      <p>Pique also looked back on when the idea to revamp the Davis Cup came to him: "I have always loved sport and tennis has been something I have always followed closely. Before, (countries) had to dedicate four weeks to the event and after seeing things clearly, I tried to be proactive to get it through. I spoke with my dad first and he said it was impossible because they would not let it be the World Cup of tennis."</p>
      <p>He added in this sense that "there are loads of good ideas but the complicated thing is the execution. I looked at options to finance it and now it seems to be going well. I am aware that in the first few years there will be losses, but from the fourth year our expectations are that it will be getting better and better because it's a 25-year project."</p>
      <h3>BARCELONA PRESIDENT?</h3>
      <p>Away from the Davis Cup, Pique was also asked, once again, about the idea of becoming Barcelona president in the future.</p>
      <p>"At the moment I am really entertained with this and the truth is that I'm really enjoying it. "Right now I want to compete as a footballer and try to keep going for as long as possible."</p>
      <p>Finally, he was asked how he felt in Madrid: "I have been coming to Madrid for 16 years and I have never encountered any problems. One thing is the rivalry between Madrid and Barcelona but it's another thing being human. I have always felt very comfortable and Madrid is my second home."</p>
