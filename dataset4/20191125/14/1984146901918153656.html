      <p>A councillor in Newcastle’s West End has been charged with aggravated stalking.</p>
      <p>Dipu Ahad, who represents the Elswick ward, will appear at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/courts">North Tyneside Magistrates’ Court</a> on December 31 after being charged by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">Northumbria Police.</a></p>
      <p>The 39-year-old has been suspended by the Labour Party but will retain his seat on the council as an independent.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-council">Newcastle City Council </a>said: “We are aware Coun Dipu Ahad has been charged with an offence by Northumbria Police.</p>
      <p>"He continues to be a councillor representing the Elswick ward pending the outcome of the police investigation.</p>
      <p>"It is inappropriate to make any further comment on what is a police matter at this stage.”</p>
      <p>Coun Ahad has served as a Labour councillor in the Elswick ward since 2007 and has chosen to remain in post as an independent councillor, after his suspension from the Labour Party and from the council’s Labour group.</p>
      <p>His current term of office runs to May 2020.</p>
      <p>A Labour spokesperson said: “The Labour Party takes all complaints extremely seriously, which are fully investigated in line with our procedures and any appropriate disciplinary action taken.”</p>
      <p>A Northumbria Police spokesman said: “Dipu Ahad, 39, of Benwell, Newcastle, has been charged with aggravated stalking.</p>
      <p>"He will appear at North Tyneside Magistrates’ Court on December 31.”</p>
