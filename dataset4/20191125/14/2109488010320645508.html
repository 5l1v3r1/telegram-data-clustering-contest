      <p>SoftBank Vision Fund and Alipay-parent Ant Financial were among the high-profile backers to increase existing investments in mobile payments company Paytm during its latest funding round.</p>
      <p>India-based Paytm announced the cash boost in a statement, though did not disclose exact sums. In an interview with <i>The</i> <i>Economic Times,</i> the company’s founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma said it had raised a total of $1 billion.</p>
      <p>The cash will contribute to the company’s <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/money/news-money/paytm-sets-aside-36m-for-expansion-drive/">previously stated goal</a> of increasing the scale and scope of its operation.</p>
      <p>In a statement Paytm said its next phase of growth would include expanding its “consumer internet” offer and bring a range of advanced financial services to a wider audience. These include loans, insurance, share dealing and sale of investment products.</p>
      <p>Other initiatives targeted include providing content services including games, news and videos through its existing platforms.</p>
      <p>Sharma added the company was “committed to bringing half a billion Indians to the mainstream economy by onboarding them in the formal financial ecosystem”.</p>
      <p>As part of its efforts to increase its reach in financial underserved areas of India, the company is set to invest INR100 billion ($1.4 billion) over the next three years.</p>
