      <h1>Nevada congresswoman endorses Biden in 2020 race</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:44:45+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rebecca-klar" target="_blank">Rebecca Klar</a></address>
      <p>Former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> on Monday picked up a congressional endorsement in the 2020 presidential primary race.</p>
      <p>Nevada Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/dina-titus">Dina Titus</a> (D), touting herself and Biden as progressives, announced the endorsement on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“Today, I’m proud to announce my endorsement of Joe Biden for President. I’m a proud progressive champion and I believe that nominating Joe gives us the best chance to enact the progressive reforms that our country desperately needs,” Titus said in a statement shared on Twitter and by the Biden campaign. </p>
      <p>Titus, seemingly referencing Biden’s years serving in the Obama administration, said he won’t need any “on-the-job training.”</p>
      <p>“I told my constituents that I would speak up about this race once I reached a decision about who will be our strongest nominee. Now I am making good on that promise. I’m excited to campaign for Joe Biden in Nevada and across the country,” she added. </p>
      <p>The Nevada Democratic caucuses will be held on Feb. 22, 2020. Nevada will be the third state to vote on a Democratic nominee, following Iowa and New Hampshire, respectively.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/nv/nevada_democratic_presidential_caucus-6866.html">RealClearPolitics average</a> of Nevada Democratic polls has Biden leading in the state by 9 points with 29 percent support. His closest competitor is Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.) at 20 percent, closely followed by Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.) less than half a point away from Warren, according to the average. </p>
      <p>But recent polls of Iowa and New Hampshire Democrats have depicted a closer race between Biden, Sanders, Warren and South Bend, Ind., Mayor <a href="https://thehill.com/people/peter-pete-buttigieg">Pete Buttigieg</a>. </p>
