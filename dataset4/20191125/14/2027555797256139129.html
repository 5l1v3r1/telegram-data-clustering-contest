      <h1>SRK to co-produce 'Bob Biswas' with Sujoy Ghosh</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:35:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Superstar Shah Rukh Khan on Monday announced his next production, "Bob Biswas", featuring Abhishek Bachchan in the lead.</p>
      <p>The actor, who is co-producing the project through Red Chillies Entertainment with director Sujoy Ghosh's Bound Script Production, took to Twitter to share the news.</p>
      <p>"#BobBiswas is coming to 'kill it!' Happy to associate with Bound Script Production to bring #BobBiswas, played by @juniorbachchan and directed by Diya Annapurna Ghosh. @RedChilliesEnt @gaurikhan @sujoy_g @_GauravVerma," Shah Rukh tweeted, along with a photo with Abhishek.</p>
      <p>Bob Biswas was a breakout character in Sujoy Ghosh's 2012 thriller "Kahaani". Played by actor Saswata Chatterjee, Biswas was an LIC agent who moonlighted as a cold-blooded contract killer.</p>
      <p>However, it is not confirmed if "Bob Biswas" is a spin-off of the character though Sujoy is associated with both the films. Diya Annapurna Ghosh will direct the new project.</p>
      <p>Red Chillies announced the project, writing, "Nomoshkar", a hat-tip to Biswas' catchphrase, "Nomoshkar... ek minute," which he used before killing his target.</p>
      <p>Abhishek said he is looking forward to working in the film.</p>
      <p>"Excited to announce my next film! Bob Biswas. Canâ€™t wait to get started. Working with many favourites. @iamsrk @gaurikhan @sujoy_g @_GauravVerma #DiyaAnnapurnaGhosh," he wrote.</p>
      <p>Sujoy said he needs "blessings and good wishes" for the film, adding, "And a minute of your time."</p>
