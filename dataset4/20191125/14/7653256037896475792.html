      <p>Mumbai: The <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Mumbai">Mumbai</a> bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/NCLT">NCLT</a>) on Monday summoned <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/axis-bank-ltd/stocks/companyid-9175.cms">Axis Bank</a> chief Amitabh Chaudhry and Zarin Daruwala, the India head of foreign lender <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Standard-Chartered">Standard Chartered</a> Bank, in connection with an alleged contempt of court case pertaining to the IL&amp;FS case.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) in a submission to the tribunal alleged that StanChart and Axis Bank were guilty of contempt of court as they had allowed Ramesh Bawa, the former chief of IL&amp;FS Financial Services, to access his bank accounts and locker despite a court-administered freeze on his assets.</p>
      <p>An Axis Bank spokesperson said the matter pertained to operations of these accounts in the bank’s branch and that it had high respect for all court/tribunal orders. The bank denied the allegations and said it would take appropriate steps.</p>
      <p>StanChart has yet to receive a copy of the order, a spokesperson said, adding, “Upon review of the contents of the order, we will decide the way forward.”</p>
      <p>The ministry’s counsel, Sanjay Shorey, submitted that Bawa and his wife accessed their joint locker on December 9 last year and then on March 26 this year, notwithstanding the asset freeze order of December 3. Inventory of the locker was yet to be determined.</p>
      <p>Bawa had also allegedly transferred nearly Rs 1.14 crore from his account despite a court order restraining him and capping his withdrawals at Rs 2 lakh per month.</p>
      <p>The NCLT issued notices to the CEOs of both banks, seeking their personal appearance, under the Contempt of Courts Act. The matter will now be heard on December 16 by a bench comprising Bhaskara Pantula Mohan and Rajesh Sharma.</p>
      <p>A bench of VP Singh and Ravikumar Duraisamy had on December 3, 2018, restrained the former directors of the IL&amp;FS group from mortgaging, selling, or creating third-party interests or disposing of movable, immovable or jointly held properties. It, however, had allowed them to withdraw Rs 2 lakh each per month from one of their accounts.</p>
