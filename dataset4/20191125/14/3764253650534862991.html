      <p>Ana-Maria Stoica, a spokesperson for the emergency services in Constanta, explained: <i>"We have already saved a small number. They were swimming in the sea."</i></p>
      <p>The reports said an investigation would commence ascertaining the reason for the accident as one of the crew members has been hospitalized.</p>
      <p>In another development, <b>Legit.ng</b> reported that Togo recently <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1260602-togoleses-designer-aman-ayviv-works-2nd-clothes-sell-europe.html">caused a revolution in the fashion industry across the world</a> in the way it has been dealing with discarded clothing items sent to it from Europe.</p>
      <p>It was reported that the discarded items are dusted off, given little or no touch and sent back to Europe where they are bought at greater prices.</p>
