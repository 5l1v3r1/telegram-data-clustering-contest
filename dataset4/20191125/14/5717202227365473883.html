        <b>Jose Mourinho has suggested that he has told the Tottenham Hotspur squad that they are always welcome to invite Mauricio Pochettino back to the club for a visit, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/tottenham-boss-jose-mourinho-opens-20956750">in comments reported by the Daily Mirror</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pochettino’s tenure was brought to an end last week, with Mourinho arriving as his successor within 24 hours of his departure being announced.</p>

      <p>The fans were keen to pay tribute to Pochettino at the weekend as Spurs won their first game under the new head coach. And it is clear that the large majority of the squad will only remember their time working under the Argentinian positively.</p>
      <p>And ahead of his second game in charge, Mourinho insisted that he has no plans to prevent the players from staying in contact with their former boss.</p>

      <p>“I spoke to his son, in our academy, and I will call him,” he said about Pochettino, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/tottenham-boss-jose-mourinho-opens-20956750">as reported by the Daily Mirror</a>.</p>
      <p>“I told the players here to tell him he’s free to come here whenever, to have a meal with the players, if he wants me here or not that’s fine.”</p>
      <h3>TBR View – Move shows Mourinho’s confidence</h3>
      <p>It is arguably a brave move from Mourinho to leave the door open for Pochettino. He will be remembered as one of the club’s most popular managers of all-time. And it would be no surprise if he was linked with a return the moment Mourinho comes under pressure or leaves.</p>
      <p>So it is a big statement from Mourinho. It gives off the impression that he is not expecting to feel insecure in his position anytime soon. The last thing he would want when the pressure is on is for his players to start inviting Pochettino back to the club.</p>
      <p>But if the club are successful, very little can be made of Pochettino remaining in contact with his former players.</p>
