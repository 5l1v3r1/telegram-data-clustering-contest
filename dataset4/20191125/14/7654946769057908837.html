      <h1>Eagles’ Carson Wentz nightmare comes without a safety net</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:40:03+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:40</time> by <a rel="author">Post Wire Report</a></address>
      <p>Eagles fans may be looking longingly in the direction of Jacksonville these days.</p>
      <p>That’s where Nick Foles, the quarterback who led them to a Super Bowl championship two seasons ago, is playing. In Philadelphia, the Carson Wentz worries are reaching new highs weekly.</p>
      <p>Wentz was picked off twice, lost two fumbles and was sacked three times against the Seahawks in a 17-9 defeat that was crushing for the Eagles’ playoff chances.</p>
      <p>“I have to be better,” Wentz, who hurt his throwing hand during the game, said afterwards. “I have to lead this team better, I’ve got to protect the football better, we can’t put it on the ground the way we did and that starts with me.”</p>
      <p>Wentz was off from the start, missing open receivers, trying short passes to eat up yards, and then shaking his hand after throws once he was hurt. He was swarmed by about the entire Seahawks defense on one snap in the second quarter and lost 8 yards on a fumble.</p>
      <p>Wentz lost a fumble in the third on a muffed handoff to Miles Sanders that led to the QB trying to turn into a run stopper. He hurt his hand, possibly his thumb, when he tried to tackle a defensive lineman. Wentz said the x-rays were negative.</p>
      <p>“It was a new kind of play,” Wentz said. “Miles and I probably didn’t just communicate enough on it. I’ve got to be better for him and give him a chance on it.”</p>

      <p>Wentz hasn’t been the same since he tore two knee ligaments in 2017 and hasn’t been helped by throwing to one of the league’s worst groups of wide receivers. Last week in a loss to New England, he was sacked five times, lost a fumble and completed only half his passes.</p>
      <p>Wentz was even worse against the Seahawks, and there’s no guarantee he’ll be better for Sunday’s game at Miami.</p>
      <p>The Eagles are 5-6, need an amazing string of fortunate events to win the NFC East, and Foles is not walking into their locker room.</p>
      <p>“It’s a hard look in the mirror,” Wentz said. “Where can I be better? We realize there’s going to be a lot of outside noise and guys looking at us. As a leader, I’ve got to be better. I’ve got to lead these guys better.”</p>
