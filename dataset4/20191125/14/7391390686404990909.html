      <p><b>What fans love: </b>"I live on a large farm and spend the day with cattle and sheep. It is inevitable that the clothes will get on the clothes, and even after passing through the washing machine and the dryer, the hair seems to remain on the clothes. These laundry balls have already completed this trouble, you put them in the washing machine, they grabbed the hair during the washing process. I have used it a dozen times and you can start to see the hair build up around the ball, but if you pull it a little, you can pull it down and toss it. So far, the results are very satisfactory."</p>
