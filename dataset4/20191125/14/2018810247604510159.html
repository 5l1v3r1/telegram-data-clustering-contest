      <p>A <i>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</i> remake is in the works from Capcom, according to two new reports. It will reportedly release in 2020.</p>
      <p>Capcom released a remake of <i>Resident Evil 2</i> this year, which was <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/01/resident-evil-2-the-kotaku-review">received warmly by fans of the franchise</a>. Given how <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/07/fans-are-remastering-resident-evil-3-nemesis">difficult it is to play <i>Resident Evil 3</i> at the moment</a>, fans have hoped for a remake of that game as well. According to a YouTube Channel called Spawn Wave, a remake of that game is not only currently in development, but on track for a 2020 release. The major European games outlet <i>Eurogamer</i> confirmed as much with their own sources, reporting this morning that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-22-sources-resident-evil-3-remake-in-development">they have also heard of this project</a>.</p>
      <p>Capcom has also been public about its desire to re-release more <i>Resident Evil</i> games.</p>

      <p>I can’t play scary games because they spook me too much, but I look forward to watching over Heather’s shoulder as she plays this one. At least I definitely have enough time to re-up my anxiety meds before all my favourite Let’s Players start getting chased around by Nemesis.</p>
