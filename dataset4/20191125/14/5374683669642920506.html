      <p>A Russian court of appeals will hold a hearing next month for an Israeli-American woman jailed on drug charges.</p>
      <p>Naama Issachar, an Israeli-American tourist in Russia who was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison after she was caught with 9.5 grams of marijuana in her bag during a stop over, will receive a court hearing for her appeal request on December 12th, local attorneys representing Issachar say.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/270153">The Israeli government</a> and <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/272155">Issacharâ€™s family</a> have called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to pardon Issachar, calling her punishment disproportionate to the crime.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/270116">The Russian government has said</a> it will consider the request for a pardon.</p>
