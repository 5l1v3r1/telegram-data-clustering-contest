      <p>A British man has been arrested in Calais after his mother was reportedly found dead next to him in the car as he was about to board a ferry to the UK.</p>
      <p>The pair, who are originally from the Isle of Wight, were due to travel back from France on Friday.</p>
      <p>French media reported that an investigation has been launched into the death and that a post-mortem on the woman, believed to be in her 80s, took place on Friday.</p>

      <p>Prosecutor of the Republic of Boulogne, Pascal Marconville, told local paper Le Journal Du Centre: “It was at the moment where they had to get out of the vehicle that the son realised she had died.</p>
      <p>“She died because of her age and a cancerous pathology which could explain the marks found on the body, which are in fact bruises.</p>
      <p>“According to the son, it would be linked to recurring falls.”</p>
      <p>Local police said that nothing suspicious was found at any of the three properties belonging to the pair.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman from the Foreign Office said: “We are aware of the death of a British woman and the arrest of a British man in Calais. We are liaising with the French authorities.”</p>
      <p>The son is reported to have been taken to a hospital in Calais.</p>
