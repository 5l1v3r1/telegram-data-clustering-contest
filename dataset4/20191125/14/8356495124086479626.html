      <p>Farm animals are suffering in muddy, confined spaces, with many people ignoring the problem and officials unsure of what to do about it, a hard- hitting report has found.</p>
      <p>The comments came in a report by a special taskforce on winter grazing.</p>
      <p>The report was ordered by the government after animal rights activists released pictures of large numbers of cows wallowing in mud after being confined in a restricted area, which was soon trampled into a quagmire.</p>
      <p>The activists said this was cruel and cited cases of cows giving birth to calves while standing knee deep in mud.</p>
      <p>Farm groups said the pictures were taken out of context and most winter grazing was not like this.</p>
      <p>Intensive winter grazing is used so that grass on the main part of the farm can recover at a time when pasture growth is limited by cool temperatures and short daylight hours.</p>
      <p>The animals are then fed crops or other food in a confined area.</p>
      <p>The report said this could cause serious harm to animal welfare, but it admitted it did not know how extensive the problem was.</p>
      <p>"Reports to the Taskforce varied, with some reporting as low as 5 percent of farmers are doing badly ... while other reports suggest 20 percent or more are doing badly with a further 30 percent of farmers not following best practice.</p>
      <p>"However there is no objective measurement."</p>
      <p>The taskforce added getting rid of winter grazing was not a sure fix either, since animals kept on their usual paddocks could be exposed to winter storms and suffer a lack of nutrition from slow-growing grass.</p>
      <p>It wanted an urgent study to be undertaken to understand winter grazing better.</p>
      <p>People needed to become more sensitive to the problem.</p>
      <p>"The widespread prevalence of poor intensive winter grazing practices leads to people 'walking past' or being desensitized to poor practice and considering it as normal," the report said.</p>
      <p>"This is unacceptable."</p>
      <p>And there were further problems, even when people cared about animal welfare.</p>
      <p>"Detection and reporting of poor performance does not appear to be happening to any great degree," it went on.</p>
      <p>"It may be hindered by parties feeling uncomfortable, a lack of understanding that complaints are anonymous, an unwillingness to report on clients or neighbours, or not knowing how to or when to report what they see."</p>
      <p>The report was even more critical of how officials were dealing with this, saying not all compliance tools available were being used and enforcement activity was hindered by a lack of clear rules.</p>
      <p>Further enforcement tools were needed, and above all, codes of welfare needed to be aligned with emerging scientific understandings of animals' sensitivity.</p>
      <p>The taskforce said animals themselves were being taken for granted.</p>
      <p>"Cows can handle a lot, but in some ways this hasn't done them any favours," the report said.</p>
      <p>"Just because they are stoic doesn't mean their welfare isn't affected. We need to remember the cow underneath."</p>
      <p>There had to be several changes, which included making sure cows can lie on dry ground, have access to shelter, have continuous clean water and a balanced diet.</p>
      <p>Animal welfare had to be taken into account as an intrinsic part of all farm management decisions.</p>
      <p>There should be a clear set of animal welfare benchmarks for all people caring for livestock, and regulators needed to set and operate against clear bottom lines, and make sure that they were met.</p>
      <p>Above all, the Ministry for Primary Industries had to take steps to implement tighter rules immediately, in order to drive change for next winter.</p>
