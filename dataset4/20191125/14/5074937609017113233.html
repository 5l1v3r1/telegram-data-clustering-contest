      <h1>Ghana AIDS Commission encourages public to access HIV testing services</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:10:53+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:10</time> by <a rel="author">Mildred Siabi-Mensah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Sekondi, Nov 25, GNA â€“ The Western Regional Committee of the Ghana AIDS Commission has urged the public to avail themselves for HIV testing services for comprehensive care as the country strives to meet the global target of ending AIDS by 2030.</p>
      <p>The HIV situation in the oil enclave of the country has raised a growing concern in recent times after registering a two percent prevalence rate over the last five years as against the national prevalence of 2.4 percent.</p>
      <p>In the 2018 National and Subnational HIV and AIDS estimates and projections, the HIV population within the region stood at 21,467 with new infections pegged at 1,278, while 910 died of AIDS related illness.</p>
      <p>Dr. Naa Jacob Mahama, the Western Regional Director of Ghana Health Service, said this in a statement to announce the region's preparedness for the 2019 World AIDS day celebration.</p>
      <p>He called on communities to make a difference by contributing their quota to eradicate the deadly disease.</p>
      <p>The call is in line with UNAIDS 90-90-90 treatment targets which ensures that 90 percent of all persons tested for the condition, 90 percent diagnosed are put on treatment and 90 percent achieve viral suppression to help eliminate HIV and end AIDS by 2030.</p>
      <p>Dr Mahama said, as Ghana strived to achieve epidemic control, it was important stakeholders worked together to achieve what he called fast track target by 2020.</p>
      <p>The Western Regional AIDS day is scheduled to take place at the Takoradi Library Conference Hall on 1st December 2019.</p>
