        <b>Burglars made off with three priceless diamond sets from a state museum in Dresden, police and museum directors confirmed Monday, in what German media have described as the biggest art heist since World War Two.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The thieves broke into the Green Vault at Dresden's Royal Palace -- home to around 4,000 precious objects made of ivory, gold, silver and jewels -- after a power cut deactivated the alarm at dawn Monday.</p>

      <p>Museum directors had earlier feared much of three sets of diamond jewellery in the collection were snatched, but the loss turned out to be more limited than thought.</p>
      <p>"The criminals didn't manage to take everything," the director of Dresden's state art collections Marion Ackermann told public broadcaster ZDF on Monday evening.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the stolen items are "of inestimable art-historical and cultural-historical value," she said.</p>
      <p>"We cannot put an exact value on them because they are priceless," said Ackermann, adding she was "shocked by the brutality of the break-in."</p>
      <p>The thieves launched their brazen raid after having set off a fire at an electrical panel near the museum in the early hours of Monday, deactivating its alarm as well as street lighting, police said.</p>
      <p>Despite the power cut, a surveillance camera kept working and filmed two<br/>men breaking in.</p>
      <p>A video released by police showed one of the men, armed with a torch, using an axe to smash the display case.</p>
      <p>"The whole act lasted only a few minutes," said police in a statement.</p>
      <p>The suspects then fled in an Audi A6 and remain on the run.</p>
      <p>The apparent getaway car was found on fire later elsewhere in the city, said police, adding that the vehicle was being examined for clues.</p>
      <p>Bild daily said the heist was "probably the biggest art theft since World<br/>War Two".</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Brutality'</b>
      </p>
      <p>At dawn on Monday, a fire had broken out at an electrical panel nearby, deactivating the museum's alarm as well as street lighting, police said, adding the investigations were ongoing to determine if there was a link to the robbery.</p>
      <p>Despite the power cut, a surveillance camera kept working and filmed two men breaking in.</p>
      <p>The thieves had smashed a window and cut through a fence before "approaching in a targeted manner a showcase, which they destroyed", head of Dresden police Volker Lange said.</p>
      <p>Using an axe, they smashed a window and cut through a grill before making their way to a display case "in a targeted manner" and destroying it, police said.</p>
      <p>They then fled in an Audi A6 and remain on the run.</p>
      <p>Ackermann said she was "shocked by the brutality of the break-in."</p>
      <p>Founded by Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony in 1723, the Green Vault is one of 12 museums which make up the famous Dresden State Art Collections.</p>
      <p>One of the oldest museums in Europe, the Green Vault holds treasures including a 63.8-centimetre figure of a Moor studded with emeralds and a 547.71-carat sapphire gifted by Tsar Peter I of Russia.</p>
      <p>The museum is now made up of two sections -- a historic part and a new part.</p>
      <p>And its historic section, which contains around three-quarters of the museum's treasures, was the one broken into on Monday.</p>
      <p>With a strict limit on the number of daily visitors, entrance to the historic vault can only be reserved in advance.</p>
      <p>Exhibits are arranged into nine rooms, including an ivory room, a silver gilt room and the central "Hall of Treasures".</p>

      </p>
      <p>One of its most valuable pieces, the green diamond, is currently on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where it is a headline attraction in the temporary exhibition "Making Marvels: Science and Splendor at the Courts of Europe".</p>
      <p>After the Royal Palace suffered severe damage in World War Two, the Green Vault remained closed for decades before it was restored and re-opened in 2006.<br/><br/><b>'Hard-earned' treasures'</b><br/><br/>For Saxony's state premier, the heist went beyond the value of the artefacts stolen.</p>
      <p>"The treasures that are found in the Green Vault and the Dresden Royal palace were hard-earned by the people of Saxony over many centuries," Michael Kretschmer said.</p>
      <p>"One cannot understand the history of our country, our state without the Green Vault and Saxony's State Art Collections."</p>
      <p>In 2010, the museum hosted a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and then president of the United States Barack Obama, on the latter's first state visit to Germany.</p>
      <p>Monday's theft is the second high-profile heist in Germany in recent years, after a 100-kilogramme, 24-carat giant gold coin was stolen from Berlin's Bode Museum in 2017.</p>
      <p>Germany's culture minister Monika Gruetters said that protection of museums and cultural institutions was now of "the highest priority".</p>
      <p>"The theft of items which make up our identity as a nation of culture<br/>strikes at our hearts," she said.</p>
