      <p>Since the start of September gold investors have been nervous, as prices haven’t moved anywhere and remained stuck in a narrow range of $100 i.e $1,440-1,540. This consolidation is a result of complex factors revolving around the commodity starting from the stance of the US <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Federal-Reserve">Federal Reserve</a> and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/European-Central-Bank">European Central Bank</a>, the slow momentum in the US economy, slow job growth in the US, disappointing China data, slowdown in Britain’s economy and the never-ending Sino-American trade dispute.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Actions of central banks</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gold investors are closely watching the stance of the US Federal Reserve in forecasting further trajectory as to what next, while the slowdown in the US economy have been blamed on the Trump administration’s year-long trade war with China, which has eroded business sentiment and plunged US and global manufacturing into recession.</p>
      <p>Although, Fed Chair Jerome Powell statement in Zurich, Switzerland, in September stated that he was not forecasting or expecting a recession, but reiterated the US central bank would continue to act "as appropriate" to keep the longest expansion in history on track.</p>
      <p>The non-farm payrolls data released On November 1 stated that US job growth slowed less than expected in October as the drag from a strike at <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/General-Motors">General Motors</a> was offset by gains elsewhere and hiring in the prior two months was stronger than previously estimated, offering some assurance that consumers would continue to support the slowing economy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Neverending trade war</b>
      </p>
      <p>The US-China trade war has damaged sentiment across the world and has resulted in monetary loss for China to the tune of $35 billion in the first half of 2019. The US imports from China subject to tariffs fell to $95 billion between January and June from $130 billion during the same period of 2018, according to a study released by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The sectors hit hardest by the tariffs are US imports of Chinese office machinery and communication equipment, which fell by $15 billion.</p>
      <p>The initial ‘phase one’ trade pact with China appeared to be in good shape and was likely to be signed around mid-November, although a finite date is still in question. However, the mood in Beijing about a trade deal is pessimistic due to the US President Donald Trump’s reluctance to roll back tariffs. When this trade war resolves is a big question for investors across the world.</p>
      <p><b>Outlook<br/></b>The trade and tariff story is a long drag and is here to stay unless both the countries come on the negotiating table. To ease tensions, China has invited US trade negotiators for a new round of face-to-face talks in Beijing as reports of ‘phase one’ trade deal may not be inked this year lingers the investors sentiment. The outcome of this event, although uncertain, will bring in volatile movements in the yellow metal.</p>
      <p>The tariff war has propelled gold, about 15 per cent higher this year in the international markets on track for its biggest yearly gain since 2010. While on the MCX, futures prices have risen by around 22 per cent.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Britain's economy grew at its slowest annual rate in nearly a decade in the three months to September as a global slowdown and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Brexit">Brexit</a> worries hit business investment and manufacturing.</p>
      <p>Gold is traditionally a safe asset in times of political and economic uncertainty and this trade war and Brexit uncertainty are the right mix to push <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/gold-prices">gold prices</a> higher in the near term. However, despite these uncertainties, the yellow metal has not been moving higher. Hence, we expect gold prices in the international markets to move lower towards $1,420 mark in a month’s time frame while MCX gold futures might move lower towards Rs 37,000 in the same time.</p>
