        <i>The Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, Chuka Umunna, has said he believes Boris Johnson's record of lying and prejudice makes him unsuitable to be prime minister.<br/>When asked by the Guardian's Peter Walker whether he thought J<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson">ohnson</a> was fit to be PM, Umunna replied: 'If you look at the things he has said and done in his behaviour, which follows the Donald Trump playbook, that should disqualify him from being able to be in office in my view. And it is a perfectly legitimate point for us to be making in this general election campaign.'<br/>Umunna did not give examples but <a href="https://boris-johnson-lies.com/">there is at least one website </a>devoted to false and misleading things Johnson has said. For examples of the PM displaying prejudice, the BBC presenter Fiona Bruce produced a list <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/22/general-election-2019-corbyn-tells-voters-to-make-sure-their-voice-is-heard-live-news?page=with:block-5dd85c2e8f080fd59fb15acc#block-5dd85c2e8f080fd59fb15acc">on Question Time on Friday</a></i>
