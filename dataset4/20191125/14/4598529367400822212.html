      <p>Outgoing Energy Secretary Rick Perry believes President Trump has a higher calling.</p>
      <p>During a preview of an interview aired on “Fox and Friends” Sunday, Perry said that he told Trump that he was God’s “chosen one” — a phrase that he appeared to borrow from a boast the President once made of himself.</p>
      <p>Last August, Trump drew backlash for saying that he was the <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-chosen-one-sarcasm">“chosen one”</a> meant to fix the U.S. economy and trade relations during an impromptu gaggle with reporters. Trump’s remarks came just hours after he tweeted a conspiracist’s quote about him being the “King of Israel” and the “second coming of God.” The President soon after said it was “fake news” that anyone took his remarks seriously.</p>
      <p>“God’s used imperfect people all through history. King David wasn’t perfect. Saul wasn’t perfect. Solomon wasn’t perfect,” Perry said.</p>
      <p>Perry then recalled what led him to tell Trump that he was “the chosen one.”</p>
      <p>“And I actually gave the President a little one pager on those Old Testament kings about a month ago and I shared it with him,” Perry said. “I said, ‘Mr. President, I know there are people that say you said you were the chosen one and I said, ‘You were.’”</p>
      <p>Perry added that he told Trump that “if you’re a believing Christian, you understand God’s plan for the people who rule and judge over us on this planet in our government.”</p>
      <p>Last month, it was reported that Perry eyed his <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/rick-perry-expected-exit-ukraine-whistleblower-scandal">resignation</a> in the wake of getting roped into the Ukraine scandal, which involved Perry and Rudy Giuliani reportedly <a href="https://www.apnews.com/d7440cffba4940f5b85cd3dfa3500fb2">wielding their influence</a> in Ukraine’s natural gas sector. Soon after, Perry was also <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/read-rick-perry-subpoenaed-in-house-impeachment-probe">subpoenaed</a> as part of the House’s ongoing impeachment inquiry.</p>
