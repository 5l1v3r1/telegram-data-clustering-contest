      <p>Karen Rhodes of Coddenham has styled her offerings around human hampers from upmarket London department store Fortnum and Mason.</p>
      <p>Retailing at up to £75 for an 'Ultimate Indulgence Kong hamper', the collection of treats takes canine luxury to new heights.</p>
      <p>Each hamper contains "sustainably sourced, safe and decadent" gifts and are presented in a reusable wicker basket.</p>
      <p>Karen said she was inspired by her love for her elderly collie cross Bailey, aged 14, which she rescued 12 years ago from a council pound.</p>

      <p>He now suffers from arthritis and hearing loss, and after she searched high and lower for suitable treats for him, she decided to launch her luxury gift service for pampered pooches.</p>
      <p>"I was watching and thinking about the luxury hampers Fortnum and Mason create for humans and how there might be many dog owners who would like the same," she said.</p>
      <p>"I googled 'luxury dog hampers' and there was nothing out there, so I decided to create them myself. It meant I could care for Bailey at home as he became less active.</p>
      <p>Karen, who runs dog walking company Suffolk Dog Services, said she also wanted to spend more time with her ageing pet.</p>
      <p>"He means the world to me and I wanted to spend the time we have together making his life as full as possible," she said.</p>
      <p>She launched Luxury Dog Hampers in October, having made Bailey her chief taster.</p>
      <p>"I'm still doing something I'm passionate about, helping dogs, while supporting Bailey," she said.</p>
      <p>She researched and sourced safe, healthy and natural products from other independent UK based businesses.</p>
      <p>Prices start at £35, with each gift box containing a selection of treats, accessories, enrichment toys and grooming products, with all items either re-usable or recyclable.</p>
      <p>Karen, who lives with husband Bill, is still walking dogs in Suffolk but her new venture means she can spend more time at home with Bailey.</p>
      <p>She's also supports animal, veterans and services charity Service Dog UK as her husband was in the army for 22 years.</p>
