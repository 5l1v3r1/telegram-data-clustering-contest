      <h2>Presenting duo Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly have defended last night's Bush Tucker trial after OfCom received 48 complaints about the tricky task</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:57:56+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:57</time> by <a rel="author">Sara-Aisha Kent, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sara-aisha-kent/</a></address>
      <p>Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, both 44, have revealed that stand-ins completed Sunday evening's 'impossible' and 'unfair' Bush Tucker trial.</p>
      <p>Ofcom revealed to Mirror Online that 48 complaints were made about last night's episode, with viewers angry that the starving campmates weren't given enough time to complete the task.</p>
      <p>Following the backlash, Geordie duo Ant and Dec took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to defend the length of time the celebs were given for the task.</p>
      <p>They also revealed that the time given for the task was justified as stand-ins managed to complete the trial in the allocated time prior to the stars taking part.</p>

      <p>Replying to an angry Twitter user, who slammed that 90 seconds was not adequate for James Haskell and Roman Kemp to have a fighting chance, the comedy pair typed: "The stand ins did it when we tested it <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> ," alongside a shrugging emoji.</p>
      <p>That was not the end of it as fans then replied to the Tweet asking for proof.</p>
      <p>One watcher demanded: "Show the stand ins doing it, I for one don’t believe it, sorry but think this is to purposely stir the s*** and spoilt an otherwise brilliant episode tonight x"</p>

      <p>Another cynical viewer wrote: "Normally I would agree. But how the stand-ins did it 15 seconds per star I find implausible."</p>
      <p>A third added: "Let’s see you both do it in 90 secs!"</p>
      <p>"Who were the stand ins?? Superman and the Flash?!?" and "Was the stand in an octopus??" joked other I'm A Celeb fans.</p>
      <p>Even TV personality Alison Hammond slammed the trial, as she responded: "Well <a href="https://twitter.com/antanddec">@antanddec</a> were the stand ins starving and weak from not having any food ?"</p>

      <p>Sunday night's show saw James and Roman left empty-handed after taking too long to extract three stars from the day bed segment of the Love Island themed challenge.</p>
      <p>It meant Ian Wright, Andy Whyment and Cliff Parisi went hungry as they weren't able to get their much-needed roast dinners.</p>
      <p>James and Roman had to lie on a Love Island-style bed and be covered with snakes as they worked to unscrew three stars from one side and screw them into other cages on the opposite side of the bed.</p>
      <p>But rugby ace James was unable to get hold of one star because there was a crab holding on to the screw.</p>

      <p>He apologised afterwards to his co-stars, but lost his temper when Dec questioned what had happened.</p>
      <p>"What was it? Well the very fact there was a giant crab in the way that you wanted me to carefully caress in a different direction while I was trying to unscrew a star in its face," he snapped.</p>
      <p>"Ooh, someone's getting a bit prickly!" Dec quipped.</p>
      <p>"Competitive spirit," laughed James.</p>
      <p>"The crab was holding onto the screw," Roman tried to explain.</p>

      <p>Their co-stars rallied around to offer them support, with Adele Roberts saying: "No one could have done that any quicker.</p>
      <p>"That's impossible. That's impossible, no one could have done that," said Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
      <p>"They needed more time, surely," muttered Ian Wright.</p>
      <p>"Ooh, someone's getting a bit prickly!" Dec quipped.</p>
