      <p><b>JERUSALEM —</b> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday accused Iran of planning attacks against the Jewish state and said everything possible would be done to prevent them.<br/><br/>The premier, who was indicted on corruption charges on Thursday and is seen to be battling for his political life, made his remarks on a visit to an army base near the border with conflict-ravaged Syria.<br/><br/>"Iran's aggression in our region, and against us, continues," Netanyahu said.<br/><br/>He was speaking on the day US General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was in the country to meet his Israeli counterpart Aviv Kohavi.<br/><br/>The two generals discussed "operational questions and regional developments", an army statement said.<br/><br/>Speaking on the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, Netanyahu said "we are taking all necessary actions to prevent Iran from entrenching here in our region."<br/><br/>"This includes the activity necessary to thwart the transfer of lethal weaponry from Iran to Syria, whether by air or overland.<br/><br/>"We will also take action to thwart Iran's effort to turn Iraq and Yemen into bases for launching rockets and missiles" at Israel, he added.<br/><br/>On Wednesday, in a rare confirmation of such operations, Israel said its warplanes carried out a "very intense" attack against Iranian forces and Syrian army targets in Syria.<br/><br/>Britain-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 23 people were killed in the strikes — 21 fighters and two civilians.<br/><br/>The previous day, Israel's "Iron Dome" missile defense system had intercepted four rockets fired from Syria, with the army blaming an "Iranian force".<br/><br/>Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit announced on Thursday he had charged Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, prompting speculation that the end of the premier's decade-long tenure was nigh. — AFP</p>
