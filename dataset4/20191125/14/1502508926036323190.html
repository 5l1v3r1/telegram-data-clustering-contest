      <h2>Barclays sees Brent trading near $60 a barrel for two years</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:40:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:40</time> by <a rel="author">Seng Li Peng and Dmitry Zhdannikov | Reuters</a></address>
      <p><b>Singapore/London:</b> <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/oil-prices">Oil prices </a>held above $63 a barrel on Monday as positive comments from the United States and China rekindled hopes in global <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/markets">markets </a>that the world's two largest economies could soon sign an interim deal to end their trade war.</p>
      <p>Brent crude futures were down 5 cents at $63.34 a barrel by 1424 GMT. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 20 cents at $57.57.</p>
      <p>"It is still all about trade talks," said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/markets">Markets </a>in Sydney. "It seems to be dominating <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/markets">markets </a>action at the moment." A move by China to protect intellectual property was also providing a supportive atmosphere for the trade talks, McCarthy added.</p>
      <p>Analysts at Barclays said they expect Brent to oscillate around $60 a barrel for the next two years.</p>
      <p>U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien on Saturday said that an initial trade agreement with China was still possible by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Chinese daily Global Times on Monday cited experts close to trade talks as saying that China and the United States have reached a broad consensus on the first phase of the trade deal, though some differences remain over the removal of tariffs.</p>
      <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Friday expressed a desire to sign an initial trade deal and defuse a 16-month tariff war that has lowered global growth.</p>
      <p>However, concern remains that events in Hong Kong, riven by months of anti-government unrest, could undermine progress in trade talk.</p>
      <p>O'Brien warned on Saturday that Washington would not turn a blind eye to what happens in Hong Kong, where demonstrators were angry at what they see as an erosion of freedoms.</p>
      <p>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meets on Dec. 5 at its headquarters in Vienna, followed by talks with other oil producers in the OPEC+ group, led by Russia.</p>
      <p>The group is widely expected to extend its supply cut to mid-2020.</p>
