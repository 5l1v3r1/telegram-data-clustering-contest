      <p>In an extremely rare case, a woman in India has given birth to a boy with two heads and three hands in a village in the Vidisha district of Madhya Pradesh state on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The doctors at the district hospital reportedly said that only one heart was visible during an ultrasound of the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911211077368719-uk-indian-experts-launch-worlds-largest-study-on-newborns-with-brain-injuries-in-india---report/">newborn</a>. However, media reports state that her husband said that in a sonography performed two months ago, the couple was told that there would be twins.</p>
      <p>The baby, which was born to a 21-year-old resident of the Ganjbasoda area, is currently undergoing intensive <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911191077347015-india-develops-worlds-first-male-contraceptive-injection/">treatment</a> in the hospital’s Intensive Care Unit.</p>

      <p>The last such case was reported from the western state of Rajashtan in 2016, when two-headed boy weighing 2.5 kg (5 lbs., 7 oz.), was born healthy but died within 32 hours of his birth.  </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/gynaecology-and-obstetrics/congenital-anomalies-birth-defects">National Health Portal of India</a> says on its website that the prevalence of birth defects in India is 6-7%, which translates to around 1.7 million birth defects annually.</p>
