      <h1>Caitlyn Jenner's daughter Kylie sips wine with Kris in cryptic post amid I'm A Celeb drama</h1>
      <h2>Kylie and Kris Jenner posted a photo mimicking the "but that's none of my business" meme in an apparent dig at Caityn</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:05:53+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:05</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kylie-jenner">Kylie</a> and Kris Jenner have posted a pointed photo where they sip their drinks silently.</p>
      <p>The picture appears to be a reference to a popular online meme which showed Kermit the Frog sipping tea and deliberately not commenting on something scandalous.</p>
      <p>It comes as they have been scrutinised for not offering a single message of support to Caitlyn Jenner, Kris' ex partner and Kylie and Kendall's parent.</p>
      <p>Kylie is wearing a leather trenchcoat while Kris donned glamorous designer sunglasses as they posed in unison for the photo.</p>
      <p>Mum of one Kylie encouraged her fans to caption the photo.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "Waiting to spill the tea like", implying there had some serious gossip to tell but were holding back.</p>

      <p>Kylie's sister <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/khloe-kardashian">Khloe Kardashian</a> suggested "two peas in a pod" for the photo which showcases Kris' strong genes.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn, 70, has become one of the favourites in the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> camp but she still has been snubbed by her daughters more than a week after she touched down in Australia.</p>
      <p>The former Olympian has been ignored by Kylie and Kendall Jenner since she embarked on her jungle adventure.</p>

      <p>Her son Brody has already declared that he is not interested what she gets up to on the ITV show, and said he had never heard of the show.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile sisters Kylie and Kendall have decided to turn a blind eye to it at all, offering not one message of support to their parent.</p>
      <p>There have already been some Kardashian secrets spilled in the jungle camp.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn recalled how Kim had dropped out of full-time education so that she could start a business selling used clothes from the great and good of Beverly Hills.</p>
      <p>She initially cried when she first went into the jungle, saying she missed her children and grandchilren.</p>
      <p>While the relationship between Caitlyn and the KarJenners has been strained in the past, it would seem that it is not just the miles between her and the family that is widening the current alleged rift between them.</p>
