      <p>Tributes have been paid to a brave young Co <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/louth">Louth</a> boy after his death at the age of 11.</p>
      <p>Daragh McNally, from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/dundalk">Dundalk</a>, passed away at Crumlin Children's Hospital on Sunday after battling an aggressive lymphoma.</p>
      <p>The youngster was diagnosed with the illness in October, shortly after returning from a family holiday.</p>
      <p>Daragh, who had autism, was delighted when his service dog Lenny won the national Nose of Tralee award in 2017 for helping him cope with behavioural issues and get him outside on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>Family friend Sheila Murphy set up a GoFundMe page last month to help fund Daragh's cancer treatment and related expenses. The page raised over €28,000.</p>

      <p>"We will all be forever grateful for everything and our little angel Daragh will be eternally in our hearts."</p>
      <p>A funeral notice on RIP.ie reads: "Peacefully, at Our Lady’s Children’s Hospital, Crumlin, in his eleventh year, nestled in the mantle of his family’s love and devoted care.</p>

      <p>A family message read: "Colleen and Paul, the Moran and McNally families would like to take this opportunity to thank most sincerely, the doctors, nurses and staff of Our Lady’s Children’s Hospital Crumlin for the wonderful care they gave to Daragh, also the staff of Scoil Réalt na Mara and The Maria Goretti Respite”<i>.</i></p>
