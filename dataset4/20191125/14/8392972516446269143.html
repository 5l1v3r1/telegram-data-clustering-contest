      <p>"I took myself off, had a little moment, looked at my kids on my pillow and I'll do the best I can, for them," Jac said.</p>
      <p>"I think she's just really scared and I know exactly that feeling and you just get to a point where you're too tired and you think, I can't do it again," said Kate Garraway.</p>
      <p>"You just have to remember, it's for your family," James Haskell reassured the star.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline actually fared better than Ian Wright during the Crevice Of Cruelty task as he was heard <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-ian-wright-screams-for-his-mum-in-tonights-terrifying-bushtucker-trial/">screaming for his mum</a> during the trial.</p>
