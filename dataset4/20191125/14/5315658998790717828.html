      <h1>Ideological Government has forgotten Victims of crime</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:02:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Sensible_Sentencing_Trust" target="_blank">Sensible Sentencing Trust</a></address>

      <p>The Sensible Sentencing Trust say the Government has lost touch with reality and public opinion with Justice Minister Andrew Little’s raft of changes proposed for corrections and justice.</p>
      <p>SST National Spokesperson Jess McVicar said “Littles announcements over the weekend that prisoners with a sentence of 3 years or less will be able to vote in next year’s Election is a major step backwards for Victims of violent crime. The Government has lost touch with reality and public protection.”</p>
      <p>“This is a purely political move, putting Victims on the back burner to get a few extra votes. Child abusers and sex offenders are commonly sentenced to less than 3 years. But Andrew Little appears to be ignoring that in making this call. Creeps who are who are imprisoned for crimes such as child pornography should not be able to vote.”</p>
