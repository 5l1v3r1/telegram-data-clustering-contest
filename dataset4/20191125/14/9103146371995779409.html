        <b>The International Police Uganda has set restrictions on vehicles entering Uganda from South Sudan.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This applies to mainly those vehicles whose owners want to change the registration to Ugandan number plates.</p>
      <p>While addressing journalists at a press briefing at the Interpol Offices in Kololo yesterday, the Interpol Director, Moses Balimwoyo said the move was agreed upon with their counterparts from South Sudan.</p>
      <p>“Whoever is entering Uganda from South Sudan and wants to change the registration to Ugandan number plates should declare it at Nimule Border. Our officials at the border will have to send documents for verification to have them cleared. All number plates will be plucked off at the border,” he noted.</p>
      <p>He said people have been entering with cars with documents in a pretext of visiting, but don’t drive back.</p>
      <p>“They later sell them off quickly when they are required to change registration. Even the South Sudan Government was complaining that they were finding it hard to know how many cars are imported in their country,” he explained.</p>

        <b>Cars intercepted</b>
      </p>
      <p>Balimwoyo said in their recent joint “Usalama Operation” against transnational crimes; they managed to intercept several posh cars suspected to have been stolen from UK, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Malawi, and South Africa.</p>
      <p>The operation was carried out between October 30th, to November 5th, by police together with other security agencies (ISO, CMI, and ESO), Directorate of Immigration and Citizens Control, Uganda Revenue Authority (URA), Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), and Uganda Registration Services Bureau (URSB).</p>
      <p>A total of 10 cars including Range Rovers and Saloon Cars are parked at the Interpol premises, while others are still held at the customs bond.</p>
      <p>Balimwoyo cautioned the public against purchasing posh cars, before crosschecking with Interpol to confirm whether the cars are not stolen or involved in any crimes.</p>
      <p>“This will safeguard you from losing your money. Now all these cars have question marks and we are still verifying them,” he noted.</p>
      <p>He also warned against rushing to buy vehicles with South Sudan number plates, saying many of them also have issues.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Arrests and recoveries</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the same operation, police discovered and destroyed 33 gardens of cannabis measuring about 30 acres, six bags of dried and crushed cannabis, and 20kgs of cannabis seeds in Busia district.</p>
      <p>“Cannabis is high in Busia. We suspect those who were cultivating cannabis in  Kenya crossed to Uganda after their country introduced a strong low. We need local authorities to help in this fight,” he added.</p>
      <p>One person was arrested at Entebbe International Airport with 134 grams of smuggled gold valued at sh17.5million, six suspected drug dealers were arrested from Kisenyi, two arrested trafficking narcotic drugs in Busia.</p>
      <p>Ten suspects were arrested in possession of about 10kgs of dried cannabis leaves and seeds in Busia, three for cultivating narcotic drugs, and two arrested with smoked monitor lizard meat and its skin; and for extracting sand from a forest reserve and lake victoria illegally.</p>
      <p>Fours vehicles were intercepted while loading illegally mined sand. They recovered 106 counterfeit printing cartridges, 2 million and 15,000 pirated CD movies and textbooks respectively, 10 bearings for timber sewing machines, 174 pieces of piston rings and 108 tension slides.</p>
      <p>Nine cases of trafficking were registered, six under inquiry, three taken to court, while 30 victims intercepted and 10 suspects arrested.</p>
      <p>Balimwoyo said the operation was intelligence-led. “We first got information and swung into action.  </p>
      <p>“Regular joint operations are needed. These crimes lead to loss of lives, taxes, destruction of the environment, affecting the tourism sector,” he added.</p>
