      <p>Bale's already-frosty relationship with Los Blancos' fans plunged to new depths during the international break, when he celebrated Wales' 2020 UEFA European Championship qualifying win over Hungary by holding a flag that controversially insulted the Spanish club. </p>
      <p>The former Tottenham Hotspur winger bore the brunt of the fans' anger on Saturday, when he was widely booed by the club's supporters during his substitute cameo in Real's 3-1 LaLiga win over Real Sociedad. </p>
      <p>After the match, Zidane, who has endured a cold relationship with Bale himself, came to the defence of the Welshman, and even praised his performance off the bench. </p>
      <p>"What we want is for our fans to be with us from start to finish, but we have no control over that," the Frenchman said, as reported by <i>Wales Online.</i></p>
      <p>"The fans can do as they please, but let's not focus on the jeers. Bale came on and did very well, he had a good 20 minutes, but let's focus on the win and the three points.</p>

      </p>
      <p>"I congratulated Bale on his performance, as I did all of the players. I haven't spoken to him about the jeers. It's something that has happened to the best players in the past, and today it's Bale's turn.</p>
      <p>"He came on and did very well and, at the end of the day, we need our fans to get behind us. That's all there is to say.</p>
      <p>"It won't affect things because it's something that's always happened, and it'll happen to many of them.</p>
      <p>"What we've got to do is keep working hard and delivering on the pitch, because what the fans want to see is that their team keep on winning.</p>
      <p>"I can't say whether it's unfair or not. Everyone's entitled to their opinion and has to make a decision about what they say on it.</p>
      <p>"The important thing in this is us and what we need. As I said yesterday, we need our fans, I can't control things, nor can Bale or anybody else. We always need our fans' backing because they give us that boost."</p>
