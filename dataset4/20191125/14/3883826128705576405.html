      <h1>General election 2019: Alliance says this campaign among worst for 'lies'</h1>

        <b>Alliance leader Naomi Long has said the current general election campaign is "one of the worst" she has ever fought in terms of "smears and lies".</b>
      </p>
      <p>She was speaking as she helped launch her party's manifesto at a Belfast hotel.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, banners attacking a variety of politicians and parties have appeared in North and South Belfast and in North Down.</p>
      <p>The party is standing candidates in all 18 seats in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>It had no MPs in the last Parliament.</p>

      <p>Mrs Long told BBC News NI: "I think it is one of the worst elections that I have ever fought in terms of the levels of smears, the levels of lies. The levels of discrimination.</p>
      <p>"I think it is just a fact now of the kind of culture that we see in politics where we treat people with disrespect where people are not allowed to differ and have a disagreement."</p>
      <p>Mrs Long, who won East Belfast in 2010 but lost it in 2015, refused to be drawn on what her target was in terms of winning seats.</p>
      <p>She said: "Of course I want to win seats and of course we are ambitious to be represented at Westminster.</p>
      <p>"It is the only level of government where we don't have an elected representative."</p>
      <p>The party remains confident that it can win parliamentary seats next month.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, Mrs Long became the party's first MEP and Alliance secured gains in the local council elections.</p>
      <p>The 40-page manifesto, entitled Demand Better, examines Brexit, Stormont, governance and transparency, work and welfare and climate action.</p>
      <p>The party wants a fresh EU referendum with the option to remain in the EU.</p>
      <p>It says there should be a special deal for Northern Ireland and that the whole of the UK should remain in the single market and the customs union.</p>
      <p>"Brexit must not become an orange and green issue," Mrs Long said.</p>
      <p>The Alliance leader added that her party was pro-Remain.</p>
      <p>"Our future lies at the heart of the EU," she said.</p>
      <p>In relation to restoring devolution in Northern Ireland, Alliance say any future inter-party talks should be "time-bound" and should be chaired by an "independent mediator".</p>
      <p>Mrs Long said that if there is no agreement by 13 January 2020, there should be "fresh elections".</p>
      <p>On the issue of securing local political agreement, the Alliance leader said "the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in must compromise".</p>
      <p>Alliance would like to see a new civic forum made up of local politicians and citizens.</p>
      <p>The party says there should be "full transparency of political donations" and it would like to see proportional representation for elections to the House of Commons and a directly elected House of Lords.</p>
      <p>Alliance would also like to see 16-year-olds allowed to vote in elections.</p>
      <p>On work and welfare issues, Alliance would like to see the repeal of the bedroom tax and an overhaul of bereavement benefits.</p>
