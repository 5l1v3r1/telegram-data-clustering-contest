      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:20:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/JustinI" target="_blank">Justin Ivey</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.52399/title.post-malones-face-is-now-on-bud-light-beer-cans">Post Malone</a> has reached the top of the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8544750/post-malone-circles-number-one-hot-100">Billboard</a> Hot 100 for the fourth time in his career. The diamond-selling artist’s single “Circles” hit No. 1 on the chart dated November 30.</p>
      <p>The single joins the Republic Records signee’s previous hits “Rockstar,” “Psycho” and “Sunflower” as No. 1 songs in his discography. “Circles” is also his first track without a guest artist to claim the top spot on the Hot 100.</p>

      <p>“Circles” appears on Malone’s latest album <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/reviews/id.3527/title.review-post-malone-backstrokes-in-his-sorrow-on-the-star-studded-hollywoods-bleeding"><i>Hollywood’s Bleeding</i></a>, which was released in September. The LP debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 after selling 489,000 album equivalent units in its first week, according to Nielsen Music.</p>
      <p>Malone’s continued chart dominance wasn’t his only achievement for the week though. He also took home the award for Favorite Rap/Hip Hop Album at the <a href="https://www.theamas.com/winners/2019-winners/">2019 American Music Awards</a> on Sunday (November 24).</p>
