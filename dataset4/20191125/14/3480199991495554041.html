      <p>Dean McDonald was in a group that threw weapons towards the Hadley house of a family involved in a feud, Shrewsbury Crown Court heard.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old, recently married and expecting a child next year, was involved in the incident on April 3 this year which began after a fight with the homeowner’s son.</p>
      <p>Prosecuting barrister Mr Dean Easthope said: “At about 7.20pm on April 3 the homeowner heard tyres screech outside.”</p>
      <p>The court heard a van and car pulled up at the address before a group armed with a knuckle duster, spanner, baseball bats, kitchen knife, spade and a pitch fork got out and were shouting for the residents to come outside and fight.</p>
      <p>The group began to throw the weapons like “missiles” towards the house.</p>
      <p>Mr Easthope added: “One of the group got into the car and drove it into the front gate. At this point they drove off."</p>
      <p>The court heard McDonald, of Websters Lane, Market Drayton, has one previous conviction of shoplifting in 2018 and breached a conditional discharge given to him for that offence.</p>
      <p>Defence barrister Mr Kevin Jones said: “The weapons were used as spears rather than in the hand.”</p>
      <p>McDonald pleaded guilty to affray on October 21. He was sentenced to an 18-month community order, 25-day rehabilitation requirement and 220 hours of unpaid work. He was fined £150 for breaching his discharge and must pay court costs of £535.</p>
