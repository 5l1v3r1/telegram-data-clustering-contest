        <b>The reported tests come a few days after a high ranking US State Department official urged Turkey to stop using the S-400 missile systems so that Ankara can get back into the F-35 stealth fighter programme.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Turkey has begun testing the S-400 missile defence systems that it purchased from Russia this summer, <a href="http://www.milliyet.com.tr/">the Milliyet daily cited an unnamed source as saying</a> on Monday.</p>
      <p>The source added that the Ankara Governorate earlier announced that the military will fly its fighter jets near the Turkish capital to test the S-400's radar systems in the next few days.</p>
      <blockquote>“Within the scope of some projects carried out in coordination with the Presidency of Defence Industries, F-16 aircraft and other aircraft belonging to the [Turkish] Air Force will carry out low and high altitude test flights on Monday and Tuesday in the skies of Ankara,” the governorate said.</blockquote>
      <h3>US Urges Turkey ‘to Destroy’ S-400s</h3>
      <p>The statement comes after a senior US State Department <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201911221077379292-turkey-says-it-will-activate-s-400s-as-us-state-department-advises-to-destroy-them/">official called on Turkish authorities to stop using the S-400s</a>, saying that “there is room for Turkey to come back to the table” to get Ankara back into the US’ F-35 stealth fighter programme.</p>
      <blockquote>“They know that to make this work they need to either destroy or return or somehow get rid of the S-400," the official told reporters at last week’s briefing.</blockquote>
      <p>It was preceded by Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar stating that his country is going to activate and make use of the S-400 air defences.  </p>
      <blockquote>“The S-400 will be functioning. At the moment, Turkish military personnel are undergoing training on the use of the S-400s. After this is concluded, the planned [use of the S-400s] will start. Do not doubt it,” he pointed out.</blockquote>
      <h3>Washington, Ankara Lock Horns Over S-400</h3>
      <p>Earlier this year, Washington announced its <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911191077347179-erdogan-says-if-us-stance-on-f-35s-doesnt-change-turkey-will-have-to-look-for-defence-alternatives/">decision to suspend Turkey's participation in the international F-35 programme</a> over Ankara's purchase of the S-400s, adding that the country would be completely removed from the project by late March 2020. Under the programme, Turkey ordered more than 100 F-35 fighter jets.</p>
      <p>The US claims that the S-400 systems are incompatible with NATO's air defence weapons and may compromise the operations of the F-35 fighter jets. Washington has repeatedly threatened to slap sanctions on Ankara over its purchase of the S-400s.</p>

      <p>Despite the US pressure, Turkey refused to reverse its contract with Russia, saying that it was a done deal which is vital for its national defence. Ankara also stressed that the S-400s were not related to the security of NATO, the US, or the F-35 in any way.</p>
      <p>Moscow and Ankara signed a loan agreement for the supply of Russian S-400 air defence systems to Turkey in September 2017. Russia completed the first shipment of S-400 components to Turkey in late July 2019.</p>

      <p>This was followed by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu saying that he did not rule out Ankara purchasing an additional batch of S-400s if necessary. The country’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that the S-400s will be fully operational in the country by April 2020.</p>
