      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:04:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:04</time> by <a rel="author">ANI</a></address>
      <p>The areas of Delhi, Haryana and Punjab are expected to get some relief from pollution as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted light to moderate <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rainfall">rainfall </a>in the next 48 hours.</p>
      <p>"According to the information by IMD, in the next 24-48 hours, a fresh western disturbance from a low-pressure area in the Pakistan-Afghanistan region will approach northern areas of India, and can cause light to moderate <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rainfall">rainfall </a>in Delhi, Punjab and Haryana," Dr PK Sidhu, head of the Department of Climate Change and Agricultural Meteorology, Punjab Agricultural University, told ANI.</p>
      <p>She further stated that people who were suffering from breathing problems caused by pollution will also get mild relief.</p>
      <p>According to IMD, light rain or drizzle is also likely to occur in several areas of Delhi between November 25 to 27.</p>
      <p>Thunderstorm or hailstorm accompanied by lightning is also likely to take place at isolated places in Delhi, Punjab and Haryana, Chandigarh, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand on November 26 and 27.</p>
      <p>Burning crop residue in the fields of Punjab has been a major reason for the rise of pollution in Haryana, Delhi-NCR and Punjab regions, leading to a thick layer of smog in the areas earlier this month. The AQI on Monday in Delhi docked at 218, which falls in the 'poor' category.</p>
