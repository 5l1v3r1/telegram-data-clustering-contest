      <h1>Colum Eastwood in warning over NHS future following 'bad Brexit'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:11:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:11</time> by <a rel="author">Michael McHugh, Press Association</a></address>
      <p>A rearguard action will be needed to save Northern Ireland's NHS if Boris Johnson wins the election and forces through a bad Brexit, the SDLP leader said.</p>
      <p>The country is struggling with long waiting lists for treatment and Colum Eastwood said difficult decisions were needed on the provision of care.</p>
      <p>Stormont has not sat since 2017 and politicians are gearing up for more negotiations aimed at restoring devolved powersharing after the general glection.</p>
      <p>Mr Eastwood said: "We think if Brexit happens badly then the NHS could be up for negotiation.</p>
      <p>"I worry about the axis between (Donald) Trump and Johnson.</p>
      <p>"I think Johnson has got no cards to play in a trade deal with the US.</p>
      <p>"Where that leaves us could be very interesting so we are going to have to fight a real rearguard action to protect public services here over the next parliament."</p>
      <p>Today, health workers <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/25/news/first-day-of-strike-action-by-healthcare-workers-begins-1773848/">took industrial action</a> in a row over pay and staffing levels.</p>
      <p>Recently the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee of MPs warned services risked deteriorating to the point of collapse without a long-term funding strategy.</p>
      <p>Mr Eastwood addressed a meeting of business leaders in Belfast.</p>
      <p>He is challenging Sinn FÃ©in's Elisha McCallion for the Foyle Westminster seat and is pledged to "stop" Brexit.</p>
      <p>Some commentators expect the SDLP to take two seats in the next parliament.</p>
      <p>Mr Eastwood said there should be no economic borders between the north and the Republic or with the rest of the UK.</p>
      <p>He added: "We will continue, the last Vietnamese soldier in the jungle, fighting to try to stop it."</p>
      <p>If Brexit happens badly, the NHS could be up for negotiation, he added, and said pro-remain voices needed to put every possible effort into stopping the divorce.</p>
      <p>He said: "It is not a done deal. A coalition of progressive parties at Westminster can, and I hope will, deliver at the very least a people's vote on the terms of Brexit.</p>
      <p>"But if there's anything we've learned over the last three years, it's that you need a plan B.</p>
      <p>"That's why I have urged parties in London to bank the terms of the backstop, preventing the return of a border across this island.</p>
      <p>"Brexit was and is an issue of such scale and importance that I continue to believe it requires a united and passionate civic response - a response giving a factual outline of the economic damage it has the potential to do to this region."</p>
      <p>The Northern Ireland Chamber of business leaders and Ulster Bank hosted Monday's discussion.</p>
      <p>Chamber president John Healy said the economy was locked on a low growth trajectory and firms were unable to plan for the future.</p>
      <p>He added: "The message from businesses therefore could not be clearer: the next Government must deliver an end to the Brexit stalemate and take decisive steps to improve business confidence across all regions of the UK."</p>
