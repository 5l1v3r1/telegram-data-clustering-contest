      <p>Musical Theatre Academy Nenagh are on a roll this month have hit all the high notes this month.</p>
      <p>They started off by winning the National Show Choir Ireland Finals on November 2 in Dublin, with 46 MTAN students between the ages of 11-19 being one of seven schools competing in the live final.</p>
      <p>And to cap it off, they will appear on this Friday’s Late Late Toy Show.</p>
      <p>For the national finals, they had to perform an eight minute singing/acting and dance piece covering a topic or theme.</p>
      <p>This was the academy’s first year taking part in the competition.</p>
      <p>They took the title of National Show Choir Ireland Champions as well as the prize money of €1,000.</p>
      <p>Their piece highlighted the importance of remembering that there is always light at the end of the tunnel, no matter how dark the journey feels.</p>
      <p>Because of the importance of their theme, the group has generously decided to donate a large portion of their prize money to a charity connected with this topic.</p>
      <p>To end what was a month, six members of the academy will perform on the Late Late Toy Show this Friday.</p>
      <p>Cleo Griffin, Leah Slevin, Kaitlyn Conroy, Grace Kilgannon, Jayden Guilfoyle and Eamonn Coffey make up the vocal group 6 Sounds and will be seen in a few segments of the show.</p>
      <p>This group have had great success this year making it to the semi-finals of RTE’s Junior Eurovision.</p>
      <p>Although they can’t give away anything, they have had the most amazing time rehearsing for the Toy Show and have got great support from everyone in Nenagh already.</p>
      <p>“It has been the most amazing few weeks, to become national champions as first timers competing in Show Choir Ireland, and to then perform on the Toy Show really is a dream come true,” said Musical Theatre Academy Nenagh director Stephanie Browne said.</p>
