      <p>THE HAGUE (Reuters) - European police agencies have knocked out several internet servers used by Islamic State in a significant blow to the armed group’s ability to spread propaganda online, the Europol police agency said on Monday.</p>
      <p>The move shut down a large number of accounts and websites run by the group’s news arm, Europol said.</p>
      <p>“They have disappeared from an important part of the internet”, Belgian prosecutors’ spokesman Eric Van Der Sypt said at a news conference at Europol headquarters in The Hague.</p>
      <p>“I cannot say at this time it is 100%, we will see how they recuperate from this. It will take a huge effort for them to come back.”</p>
      <p>Police officers involved in the joint action by Europol and police agencies in 11 countries said around 26,000 items were taken offline last week, including a high number of communication channels.</p>
      <p>Europol earlier said in a statement it had been working with nine of the largest Internet platforms to counter Islamic State propaganda operations, including with Google, Twitter, Instagram and Telegram.</p>
      <p>Europol said on its website it had examined “propaganda videos, publications and social media accounts supporting terrorism and violent extremism” over the course of two days last week.</p>
      <p>“Telegram was the online service provider” where most offending material was found, Europol said.</p>
      <p>“As a result, a significant portion of key actors within the IS network on Telegram was pushed away from the platform.”</p>
      <p>It praised Telegram’s assistance and said the company was helping Europol to “root out ... malicious content.”</p>
      <p>There was no immediate response from Telegram to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>“IS is not all about the battlefield. They have radicalized and have recruited a large number of foreign fighters in our countries through those media channels,” Van Der Sypt said.</p>
      <p>“These activities can be directly linked to the radicalization of European citizens.”</p>
