      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Intel and MediaTek partnered together to bring 5G modems to PCs.</li>
        <li>Dell and HP are "expected to be among the first OEMs" to make laptops powered by Intel and MediaTek 5G technology.</li>
        <li>The first rollout of 5G PCs is expected in early 2021.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>MediaTek announced a partnership with Intel that will bring 5G modems to PCs. The first PCs with built-in 5G support are expected in early 2021, according to MediaTek. MediaTek adds that "Dell and HP are expected to be among the first original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to deliver laptops powered by Intel and MediaTek's 5G solution."</p>
      <p>MediaTek's work with 5G technology for mobile phones will help the transition to 5G support in PCs. The new 5G modems for PCs are based in part on the Helio M70 5G modem for smartphones.</p>
      <p>"5G is poised to unleash a new level of computing and connectivity that will transform the way we interact with the world," according to Intel executive vice president and general manager of the Client Computing Group, Gregory Bryant. He also states that "Intel's partnership with MediaTek brings together industry leaders with deep engineering, system integration, and connectivity expertise to deliver 5G experiences on the next generation of the world's best PCs."</p>
