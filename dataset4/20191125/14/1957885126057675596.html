      <h3>Dell Black Friday laptop deals</h3>
      <p>Let's start in the obvious place: laptops. Basically everything is on the table, from office-friendly models to Dell's assortment of own-brand and Alienware gaming machines. Even the latest models, with Intel 10th-generation processors, are included after being released just a few months earlier. Many laptops have only a nominal discount to get them onto the deal page, but you can get an additional 12 per cent or 15 per cent off with codes and so watch out for that!</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The best cheap gaming laptop on offer is the new Dell G3 15. For £680 (<a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/3gui">reduced by £119</a> with code <b>BF15</b>), you get a 9th-gen Core i5 and GTX 1050 3GB. That's not the best graphics card on the market, but it's good enough for CS:GO and other esports games with low system requirements - and noticeably better than integrated graphics cards. The rest of the specs are reasonable too - 8GB of RAM, a 512GB NVMe SSD and a 1080p display. If it's within your budget, you can upgrade to a higher spec model for £765 (<a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/30z8">again, reduced by £134 with code BF15</a>), which has a better GTX 1650 graphics card, a secondary 1TB HDD for installing games and a faster Core i7 processor.</p>
      <p>First up: the XPS 15-inch laptop is the first mega deal of the day, with a high-spec configuration discounted 21 per cent to £1999. That's over five hundred quid off a laptop that includes a ninth-generation Core i9 processor and 15-inch 4K display, backed with 32GB of RAM and a 1TB NVMe SSD. This is a great configuration for a mobile workstation, capable of photo and video work, and gaming is even on the cards thanks to the discrete GTX 1650 GPU.</p>
      <p>Next is the <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/category/xps-deals">new XPS 13</a>, which comes with a tenth-generation Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/3bqk">This is a mid-range configuration</a>, dropping from £1199 to £1020 with code BF15, but it's still a powerful yet compact laptop - ideal for work and even capable of gaming in esports titles thanks to the decent integrated graphics solution.</p>

        <img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2019/articles/2019-11-25-10-01/inspiron_laptops.jpg/EG11/resize/1280x-1/quality/75/format/jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Another mega deal is the Inspiron 14 3000 laptop, a budget model that has <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/3ix0">has dropped from £300 to £200</a>. There are only a few units left here, but you get very solid specs for the money: an Intel Celeron processor, a 14-inch 768p display, 128GB SSD and 4GB of RAM. Not the fastest laptop in the world, but for £200 it's an unparalleled choice!</p>
      <p>Another Inspiron laptop, the Inspiron 15 5000, is also a mega deal, and has been <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/3ix2">reduced from £668 to £579</a>. For the extra cash, you get a 15-inch 1080p display, sizeable 512GB SSD, 8GB of RAM and a 10th-gen Core i5 processor. That sounds like a really good mix of price and performance, so if you're looking for a fast laptop for work or school, I'd go for this one!</p>

      <h3>Dell Black Friday monitor deals</h3>
      <p>Let's take a look at monitors now. Dell and its subsidiary, Alienware, make some of the best in the business, whether you're looking for a fast refresh gaming panel or a colour-accurate model ideal for content creation.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2019/articles/2019-11-25-14-30/AW2720hf.jpg/EG11/resize/1280x-1/quality/75/format/jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The best deal we've found so far is on the AW2720HF, a 27-inch IPS monitor with a "blazing" 240Hz refresh rate. It's been <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/3jq2">discounted from £580 to a cool £450</a>, a reduction of about £130. That makes it an excellent choice for fast-paced games, while offering a larger picture and better colour reproduction than Dell's earlier 240Hz monitors, which used 24.5-inch TN panels. Despite being an IPS screen, pixel response times are excellent at 1ms and contrast ratio is decent too, at 1000:1. In terms of variable refresh rate (VRR) tech, the monitor is both FreeSync and G-Sync Compatible so it works great out of the box with Nvidia and AMD graphics cards.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2019/articles/2019-11-25-10-37/monitors.jpg/EG11/resize/1280x-1/quality/75/format/jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Another good deal is on the Dell S2716DG, which has been <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/3ic2">reduced by 51 per cent to £403</a>. This is a great price for a 27-inch monitor that includes all of the must-have gaming specs: a 2560x1440 resolution, a 155Hz refresh rate, 1ms GtG pixel response times and full-fat G-Sync. This is an awesome spec sheet that sits right in the current sweet spot for mid-range gaming, and it's backed up by universally positive user and critic reviews. If I had to go out and buy a monitor today for playing slow and fast-paced games, this is the best-of-both-worlds option I'd go for!</p>
      <p>Another obvious highlight from today's sale is the 240Hz Alienware 25, also known as the AW2518HF, which has been discounted from <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/3ibs">£430 to £299 - a 30 per cent reduction</a> - although it has occasionally sold for as little as £250 earlier this year. This FreeSync and G-Sync Compatible monitor works well on both AMD and Nvidia graphics cards and has that ridiculously high 240Hz refresh rate, making it easier to excel at fast-paced competitive games like Counter-Strike or Call of Duty. The display's image quality is surprisingly strong for a TN panel, so watching videos or image editing works well too.</p>
      <p>(The G-Sync version of this monitor, the AW2518<b>H</b>, has also been <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/3ibu">reduced from £635 to £550</a>, but we recommend getting this model on Amazon (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alienware-AW2518H-Anti-Glare-LED-backlit-Response/dp/B073RLP9QC?tag=eurgam-df-uk-21">where it's cheaper at £459</a>) - or consider the cheaper FreeSync version as you can manually enable G-Sync in the Nvidia control panel.)</p>
      <p>Another interesting inclusion is the extremely extra AW3418DW, a 34-inch 3440x1440 monitor that overclocks to 120Hz. It's been <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-uk/productdetail/3ibw">reduced from £1170 to £849</a>. (The same monitor is also <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alienware-AW3418DW-Curved-UltraWide-Monitor/dp/B076PTMVJ8?tag=eurgam-df-uk-21">available on Amazon at the same price if you prefer</a>.) That results in a crisp, fluid picture that completely fills your field of view - quite an experience. As it's an IPS panel, colours are accurate and viewing angles are strong too, so this is a great choice for colour-sensitive work like image or video editing. The monitor includes G-Sync, which removes tearing and judder without hampering input lag on PCs with Nvidia graphics cards. This monitor isn't cheap, but given that this ultra-wide could replace two smaller monitors it's actually quite reasonable! After all, once you try ultra-wide you won't want to go back...</p>
