      <h1>Cowboys Reportedly Make Decision On Potential Staff Changes After Loss To Patriots</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:59:40+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>The Dallas Cowboys lost to the New England Patriots on the road on Sunday, falling to 6-5 on the season. In the aftermath, many have been wondering if the team will make any coaching changes – especially since team owner Jerry Jones <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/jerry-jones-reaction-loss-patriots">expressed his frustration after the game.</a></p>
      <p>According to ESPN’s Ed Werder, the Cowboys will not be making any changes just yet. Werder reports that there will be no “immediate” changes to the staff – including on special teams.</p>

      <p>Of course, that doesn’t mean Jason Garrett and his staff aren’t on the hot seat. The Cowboys still lead the NFC East, but they’ve played underwhelming football much of the season. They likely need to make a deep playoff run for Jones to consider keeping the staff intact.</p>
      <p>Dallas struggled to move the ball on offense on Sunday, though much of that was due to the weather. The bigger issues came on special teams.</p>
      <p>New England, meanwhile, didn’t play its best game of the season but still found a way to get to 10-1. The Patriots are trending towards the No. 1 seed in the AFC.</p>
      <p>Dallas won’t have much time to lick its wounds. The Cowboys play on Thanksgiving Day against the 8-3 Buffalo Bills.</p>
