      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/filton">Filton</a> Leisure Centre could shut unless the town council forces residents to pay an extra 26 per cent in its share of council tax, it has been claimed.</p>
      <p>The potential hike in the precept — about £60 a year on average — has sparked a row between <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/south-gloucestershire">South Gloucestershire</a><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/conservative-party">Conservatives</a> and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">the Labour group</a> which runs the town council.</p>
      <p>Tories claim the massive rise in bills, in an area where householders already foot the highest council tax in the district, is “shameful”.</p>
      <p>Labour insists nothing has yet been proposed, let alone decided, but admits the figures, which came from a report by the town council’s accountant at its latest meeting, were “frightening”.</p>
      <p>South Gloucestershire Tory Cllr Chris Wood, who is also a Filton town councillor, blamed “financial mismanagement” on the threat to bills and the loss-making leisure centre, which is the only one in the unitary authority district to be run by a town or parish council.</p>
      <p>He said the extra £133,000 that would be generated by the tax increase would be spent keeping it afloat, meaning over three-quarters of the town council’s entire budget was swallowed up by the complex.</p>
      <p>“Our town council already charges local residents the highest precept in South Gloucestershire, and now households on average are going to be taxed an extra £60 a year without any longer-term financial plan in place to make the leisure centre sustainable,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Instead of coming up with a strategy that deals with the problem, years of poor financial management means residents are instead being lumbered with this demonstrable tax hike.</p>
      <h3>'Desperately sad situation'</h3>
      <p>“Back in May I raised the point that many leisure centres around the country, including those in South Gloucestershire, are run by external charitable trusts and that we should consider a similar model if we are to make positive progress.</p>
      <p>“Sadly, however, this suggestion was not taken seriously and despite the seriousness of the situation being right in front of everyone’s faces, very little effort has been made to investigate these alternative models.</p>
      <p>“As such the town council is now in an even worse situation and the leisure centre may be forced to close.</p>
      <p>“It’s a desperately sad situation because after years of financial mismanagement, this treasured community asset, which has been used for generations, may be forced to close.”</p>
      <p>Filton Town Council’s Labour chairman Darryl Collins told BBC Radio Bristol’s Emma Britton breakfast show: “The situation is our accountant gave us our annual report and it frightened us to death.</p>
      <p>“It blew us out of the water, really.</p>
      <p>“It’s not shameful, it’s what the accountant is telling us.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got to work with that. The accountant has dumped us with this challenge and we’ve got to find out how to work around it.</p>
      <p>“At this moment I have no idea because we’ve been struggling for a while with the reductions from South Gloucestershire year on year — they call it austerity — and somewhere we’ve got to find that money.</p>
      <h3>'Leisure centre struggling'</h3>
      <p>“We now have to figure out how we can move forward without this massive increase in the precept.</p>
      <p>“We have a leisure centre that’s struggling.</p>
      <p>“There are all sorts of options but we haven’t had the discussions yet.”</p>
      <p>Mr Collins said town council staff were investigating whether the leisure centre could be run as a charitable trust.</p>
      <p>He added that it was “just not true” that the council had agreed a 26 per cent rise.</p>
      <p>The town council currently charges Filton residents in Band D homes £233.69 a year, which is called the precept.</p>
      <p>It is added to the amount billed by South Gloucestershire Council, which forms the bulk of council tax, as well as the police and fire service.</p>
