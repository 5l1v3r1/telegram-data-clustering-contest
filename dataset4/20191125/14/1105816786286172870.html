      <h1>Transport for London rejects new licence for Uber</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:11:41+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>LONDON: </b>London’s transport authority on Monday refused to renew an operating licence for the ride-hailing giant Uber because of safety and security concerns.</p>
      <p>“Transport for London (TfL) has concluded that it will not grant Uber London Limited (Uber) a new private hire operator’s licence in response to its latest application,” it said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The rejection is the latest set-back to the firm’s operations in London, which have been targeted by protests from traditional black cab drivers to previous licence suspensions.</p>
      <p>In September, Uber was granted a two-month extension to its licence following the expiry of a previous 15-month agreement. The extension was conditional on passenger safety improvements.</p>
      <p>But TfL said on Monday there were a “pattern of failures”, including the use of unauthorised drivers on other drivers’ accounts, allowing them to pick up passengers.</p>
      <p>The transport authority said this happened at least 14,000 times, endangering users, as it invalidated insurance. Some trips took place with unlicensed, suspended or dismissed drivers.</p>

      <p>TfL said it recognised steps the company had taken to address such issues but was concerned about the ease with which its checks and balances could be manipulated.</p>
      <p>Legislation allows Uber 21 days to appeal and the company can continue to operate during this time.</p>
      <p>Helen Chapman, director of licensing, regulation and charging at TfL, said safety was its “absolute top priority” and the infringements were “unacceptable”.</p>
      <p>“It is clearly concerning that these issues arose, but it is also concerning that we cannot be confident that similar issues won’t happen again in future,” she added.</p>
      <p>Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said he backed the decision. He added he recognises the decision would be unpopular but that companies need to play by the rules.</p>
      <p>“Keeping Londoners safe is my absolute number-one priority, and TfL have identified a pattern of failure by Uber that has directly put passengers’ safety at risk,” he said.</p>
