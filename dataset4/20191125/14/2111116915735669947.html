      <p>We're only a few days away from <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a>, but retailers have launched fantastic AirPods deals earlier than ever this year. We've got options for every version covered too with the standard or wireless charging case models of the standard AirPods and even a first-time discount for the superb AirPods Pro.</p>
      <p>So if you've been waiting for a great AirPod deal, today's your lucky day. In the US Walmart and Amazon have come out fighting and have the lowest prices the AirPods and AirPods Pro respectively. Over in the UK, the honors are split between Amazon and Laptops Direct. You can get the standard 2019 AirPods from just <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model/604342441">$139</a> in the US, while in the UK, they're down to a very tempting <a href="https://www.laptopsdirect.co.uk/apple-airpods-with-charging-case-2nd-generation-mv7n2zm-a/version.asp">Â£129</a>. And while those are great prices, we've found discounts for the versions with the wireless charging case that are arguably even better value.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-airpods-2019-review">Apple AirPods</a> come with a charging case that provides 20 hours of battery life and up to three hours of talk time on a single charge. The truly wireless earbuds received an upgraded H1 Chip that results in faster pairing and seamless connectivity. The H1 chip also allows you to use your voice to ask Siri questions. You can adjust the volume, skip songs, and even make calls completely hands-free.<br/><br/>Discounts on AirPods are extremely rare but this is the best time of year to get a better deal than usual for the Apple earbuds. We don't know how much longer these stores will have the AirPods on sale, so you should take advantage while you can. Not ready to buy today, then feel free to bookmark our guide to the best <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/apple-airpods-black-friday-deals">AirPods Black Friday</a> deals.</p>

      <p>Save $20 on Apple's latest model AirPods at Walmart today. That's the biggest discount yet for this model. When the original AirPods first released we rarely saw any discounts at all. This is certainly better than the Black Friday price last year which saw a mere $7 shaved from the MSRP on the last-gen version.View Deal</p>

      <p>Amazon has the cheapest price in the land for the brand new AirPods Pro and this is a red hot deal. Stock keeps going in and out, but you can still order them at this fantastic price even if you might have a wait a while for delivery - for what it's worth we don't see stock taking that long to arrive at all.<br/>View Deal</p>
