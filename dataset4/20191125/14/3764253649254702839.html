      <p>Pep Guardiola has dropped hints suggesting his assistant Mikel Arteta could replace embattled Arsenal manager Unai Emery at Emirates Stadium.</p>
      <p>Emery is currently going through a turbulent time at Arsenal and another disappointing <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1278389-arsenal-southampton-lacazettes-goal-gunners-2-2-draw-saints.html">2-2 draw against Southampton</a> has piled up more pressure on the Spaniard with Arsenal fans desperately seeking for a fresh breath.</p>

      <p>Although the former PSG boss <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1272491-unai-emery-arsenal-boss-suggests-quit-growing-pressure.html">admitted he was not deterred by the growing discussion</a> surrounding his job, report from England claims he has been <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276403-unai-emery-arsenal-boss-1-month-ultimatum-save-job.html">issued one-month ultimatum</a> to prove his potential worth.</p>
      <p>Arteta, who represented Arsenal from 2011 to 2016, has now been tipped as a potential replacement for Emery who took up Arsenal mantle after Arsene Wenger's lately inglorious 22-year spell.</p>

      <p>Speaking about the Spaniard's potential move from Etihad to Emirates, Manchester City manager Guardiola bluntly suggested it is possible.</p>
      <p><i>"I Want him to stay but personal live, professional desire is the professional desire,"</i> Pep Guardiola said.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"I want Arteta to stay with us whatever rumours there might be linking him to any other job. He was an incredible player with great vision.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"As a defensive midfielder it’s the perfect position to learn the game. He will be a manager soon or later."</i>
