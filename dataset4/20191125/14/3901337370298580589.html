      <h1>Onyango’s Substitution Explained After Downs TKO Win  </h1>

      <p>Mamelodi Sundowns suffered an early blow during their 2-1 win over Golden Arrows at the weekend, though they were still able to secure a spot in the final of the Telkom Knockout next month to face Maritzburg United.</p>

      <p>At half-time, goalkeeper Denis Onyango was replaced by Kennedy Mweene and coach Pitso Mosimane explained after the match why the Ugandan shot-stopper had to make way for his deputy midway through the cup tie. </p>
      <p>“He’s got a hamstring problem,” Mosimane told reporters.  </p>
      <p>“There are a lot of games and then they come from the international duty. He played two games, kept two clean sheets and he has been travelling as well. All those things contribute. Sometimes they train hard these national teams.” </p>
      <p>Sundowns host AmaZulu at Loftus Versfeld tomorrow night as they resume their Absa Premiership campaign and look to close the gap on log leaders Kaizer Chiefs, who lead by a healthy 10 points.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear yet whether Onyango will return to action, but the early substitution on Saturday afternoon suggests he may need more time to recover.</p>
