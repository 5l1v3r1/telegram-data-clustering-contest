      </figure>
      <p>The HQ building for the <a href="https://www.mclaren.com/group/news/views/stunning-and-sustainable-mclaren-technology-centre/">McLaren Group</a> in Woking, Greater London, is one great example of a cool office. It houses around <b>1,000 workers</b> and is also home for McLaren's Racing Formula One and McLaren Automotive.</p>
      <p>For any fan of racing and high-performance automobiles in general, having a chance to work in this office must seem like a dream come true. The building comes complete with a fine collection of vintage cars from McLaren's times gone by. </p>
      <p>The building is also a masterpiece in modern architecture and is one of the sustainable buildings in the UK. Built on the site of a former intensive farm, the building was designed from the ground up to help "breathe life" back into the local environment.</p>
      <p>"In 2010 the building earned Carbon Trust Standard certification. In order to keep this highly valued recognition of commitment to the environment, we are re-evaluated every two years. Just like our search for new ideas, this is a challenge we rise to with a constantly renewed enthusiasm." - <a href="https://www.mclaren.com/group/news/views/stunning-and-sustainable-mclaren-technology-centre/">McLaren</a>. </p>
      <h3>2. Steelworks, Grand Rapids, Michigan U.S.</h3>

        <figcaption>Source: <i><a href="https://www.steelcase.com/find-us/locations/americas/grand-rapids-michigan/">Steelworks</a></i></figcaption>

      <p><a href="https://www.steelcase.com/find-us/locations/americas/grand-rapids-michigan/">Steelworks</a>, a Michigan-based architecture, furniture, and technology products, and services company, is another organization with an awesome office. This HQ in Grand Rapids, Michigan looks more like a place of play than work.</p>
      <p>The company was founded in 1912 and has grown to become one of the world's leaders in its field. Their HQ building in Grand Rapids is today, home to over <b>2,000</b> employees.</p>
      <p>Steelwork's open-plan office's design pushes the very definition of the term. Airy, open-plan and well designed, the office feels more like somewhere you'd go to meet your friends for a coffee rather than sit down to work.</p>
      <h3>3. Canary Wharf, London, UK</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Home to multiple organizations, <a href="https://canarywharf.com/">Canary Wharf</a> in London, UK is another example of a great office to work. Rather than being one single building, the wharf is an entire business district.</p>
      <p>It covers well over <b>1.3 million square meters</b> and is sited in West India Docks in East London. The site is widely considered to be one of the world's greatest feats of civil engineering.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://business.financialpost.com/business-insider/an-inside-look-at-googles-luxurious-googleplex-campus-in-california">Google's Googleplex</a> HQ, located near San Jose in California is another of the world's coolest offices. The name for the campus is a portmanteau of Google and Complex. </p>
      <p>With Google constantly being voted as one of the best companies to work for, their main HQ office doesn't disappoint. </p>
      <p>While specific details about the site are few and far between, Google's PR team is very strict on releasing details, it is clearly a fun place to work. </p>
      <h3>5. Skype Office in Stockholm, Sweden</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/nR6bkKzMwo/sizes/worlds-coolest-offices-canary-skype_resize_md.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.archdaily.com/136529/skype-offices-in-stockholm-ps-arkitektur">Skype's office in Stockholm</a>, Sweden is another fantastic office to work at. Set up in a former clothing factory built-in 1846, the office is very cool indeed. </p>
      <p>The factory was used as a clothing factory until 1857 when it was duly converted for use as a brewery and renamed to <a href="https://munchenbryggeriet.se/"><i>Münchenbryggeriet</i></a>. It would remain as a brewery until 1971.</p>
      <p>Skype commissioned <b>PS Arkitektur</b> to transform the former München Brewery into an office space for roughly <b>100 employees. </b></p>
      <h3>6. Etsy Office, New York, U.S.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.officelovin.com/2017/02/13/tour-etsys-super-cool-brooklyn-headquarters/">Etsy's</a> office in Brooklyn, New York is another example of offices-done-right. Designed from the ground up to be as cozy as possible, the office is a wonderful place to work.</p>
      <p>The popular e-commerce company moved to its new office in 2016 after it was totally refurbished by the design firm <a href="https://www.gensler.com/">Gensler</a>. Like other offices on this list, it resembles less an office and more somewhere you would actually pay to visit.</p>
      <p>Resplendent with interesting architectural features it also has a large number of indoor plants to help make staff want to return rather than run away at day's end.</p>
      <h3>7.Cannon Design, St. Louis Regional Office</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Located in the <a href="https://www.cannondesign.com/our-work/work/cannondesign-st-louis-power-house/">Power House building in St. Louis</a>, Cannon Design's office is like nothing else you've seen. The building, built-in 1928,  used to be used to provide steam heating to several buildings in the local area until around 1980 when it was decommissioned. </p>
      <p>Left as a derelict for many decades thereafter, Cannon Design acquired the site and decided to revive it to its former glory. </p>
      <p>"Although the building’s exterior shell and original structural steel were fundamentally sound, significant imagination and rigorous design analysis were required to convert the building for workplace use." - <a href="https://www.cannondesign.com/our-work/work/cannondesign-st-louis-power-house/">Cannon Design</a>. </p>
      <p>Today it is a masterpiece in how to design an office from the ground up. </p>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.vocon.com/">Vocon's HQ</a> is another awesome office that anyone would kill to work at given half a chance. Situated in Cleveland, the office is located in a historic building from the 1920s.</p>
      <p>Vocon is an interior and architectural design studio with around <b>60-70 employees</b>. According to Vocon, their HQ interior was designed “to bring clients in and demonstrate numerous design concepts simply by walking them through the office”.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Designed by <a href="https://www.designbuild-network.com/projects/red-bull-new-amsterdam-hq/">Sid Lee Architecture</a>, the energy drink manufacturer that "gives you wings" HQ is something out of this world. Built inside an ex-shipbuilding factory in Northern Amsterdam, this is one of the coolest offices in the world.</p>
      <p>It is divided into three main parts all decorated with plywood and metal parts. And the coolest part is that it also comes complete with a DJ console.</p>
