      <h1>Chubb to buy added stake in China's Huatai Insurance for $1.53 bln</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:31:32+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:31</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Insurer Chubb Ltd said on Monday it will buy up to an additional 22.4% stake in Chinese insurer Huatai Insurance Group Co Ltd for 10.8 billion yuan ($1.53 billion), as it looks to bank on a rapidly growing sector in the country.</p>
      <p>Chubb, which already holds nearly 27% stake in Huatai, said it would first buy 15.1% and then an additional 7.1% stake based on the completion of the first contingent.</p>
      <p>The Chinese insurance market has seen fast growth in recent years, becoming an attractive market for foreign companies seeking new sources of growth and revenue.</p>
      <p>In March, Chubb raised its stake in Huatai to 26.2%, following an approval from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, marking the first time a domestic Chinese financial services company converted to a so-called “Sino-foreign joint venture.”</p>
      <p>Last year, Beijing set an agenda to open up its financial sector and has been taking steps to relax foreign ownership in life insurance and asset-management joint ventures.</p>
      <p>“We are committed to supporting Huatai as a long-term strategic shareholder and we have great confidence in the long-term potential of the Chinese insurance market,” said Evan Greenberg, Chief Executive Officer of Chubb.</p>
      <p>Chubb will buy Huatai shares from its shareholders, Chinese chemicals maker Inner Mongolia Junzheng Energy and Chemical Group Co Ltd, and one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.</p>
