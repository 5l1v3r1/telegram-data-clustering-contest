      <h1>A Komodo dragon hit the beach wearing a turtle as a hat, and there's video evidence, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h1>

        <li>Fashion’s all about taking risks, but a Komodo dragon has taken it to another level by hitting the beach with a turtle as a hat.</li>
        <li>The large lizard rocks the hat in a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=19&amp;amp;v=M2h0ZEi65W8&amp;amp;feature=emb_title">posted</a> to YouTube.</li>
        <li>Seemingly realizing the trend isn’t likely to take off, the image-conscious Komodo dragon eventually discards the headwear.</li>
        <li>Only about 3,000 Komodo dragons remain in the wild, according to <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/03/05/komodo-population-continues-decline-national-park.html">The Jakarta Post</a>.</li>

      <p>Fashion has given us a lot of strange trends over the years, but even we have a hard time thinking turtles as hats will ever become a thing.</p>
      <p>Despite that, a seriously strange video posted to YouTube by the channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdAeRRjq6vjnAkxatZVxxxg/featured">RM Videos</a> – which appears to license user-generated content from a company called <a href="https://www.jukinmedia.com/">Jukin Media</a> – shows a Komodo dragon sauntering onto a tropical beach in Indonesia wearing a turtle’s shell on its head.</p>
      <p>After glancing around, and apparently feeling self-conscious, the rather large lizard decides to remove the head-snapping headwear and pose dramatically – no doubt hoping it’ll be discovered and become Asia’s next fashion icon.</p>
      <p>It’s unknown who originally shot the video or when it was taken, making it rather difficult for potential casting agents to get in touch with the Komodo dragon undoubtedly dreaming of a life of glitz and glamor.</p>

      <p>At up to 10 feet long and typically weighing about 150 pounds, Komodo dragons are the world’s largest lizards.</p>
      <p>Found in Indonesia, their bites can be deadly because of the amount of venom and harmful bacteria in their saliva. <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/03/05/komodo-population-continues-decline-national-park.html">According to The Jakarta Post</a>, only about 3,000 of the animals are thought to be left in the wild.</p>
      <p>It should also be noted it’s not a very good idea to get close to a Komodo dragon – they have been known to attack humans, sometimes fatally.</p>
      <p>While the rarity of the cold-blooded creatures means seeing one is a pretty special experience, it’s clear this image-conscious Komodo dragon wanted to be a little more extra.</p>
