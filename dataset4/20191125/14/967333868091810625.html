      <p>The world's top luxury goods company, Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH), has agreed to buy US-based jeweller Tiffany&amp;Co for $16.2 billion.</p>
      <blockquote>"The acquisition of Tiffany will strengthen LVMH's position in jewellery and further increase its presence in the United States," LVMH and Tiffany said in a joint statement.</blockquote>
      <p>Under the deal, each Tiffany share is valued at $135 in cash and is higher than the initial offer of $120 per one share - which valued the business at $14.5bn. The companies said that the deal is expected to be closed in mid-2020. </p>
      <p>LVMH is run by France's richest man, Bernard Arnault, and has 75 brands, 156,000 employees and a network of more than 4,590 stores. Other brands include Christian Dior, Kenzo, Dom Pérignon, Tag Heuer, and Moet &amp; Chandon.</p>
      <p>Tiffany&amp;Co was founded in New York in 1837 and is best known for its signature robin's-egg blue packaging. The Louis Vuitton brand is famous for its handbags. </p>
