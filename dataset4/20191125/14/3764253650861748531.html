        <b>Lionel Messi has over the decade proved his amazing superhuman on the pitch to the joy of football fans but nothing warms hearts than the Barcelona star's fatherhood experience.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Argentine football captain was recently spotted playing with his child Ciro and that experience shows how lenient Messi can be with kids.</p>
      <p>In a short clip shared by his wife Antonella Roccuzzo, the 32-year-old was seen playing with Ciro in what appears to be a <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1250385-soft-bentley-benz-gucci-audio-lyrics-reactions.html">soft</a> duel between a loving father and son.</p>

      <p>Donning a grey-looking long-sleeve cloth with a black trouser that has glaring touches of wine, Messi sits on the bare floor in a corner of his parlour tossing a small plastic bottle up to the joy of his watching kid.</p>
      <p>Ciro made futile attempts to get the bottle from his father, but the moment he managed to beat his Messi to the tool, they lightened the atmosphere up with bright soft laughter.</p>

      <p>The video, which has amassed over three hundred and eighty-five thousand views on Twitter, has warmed hearts of football-loving social media users who hailed the Barcelona talisman's fatherhood style.</p>
      <p><i>"Ciro's laugh is everything. So cute,"</i> a user said accompanied by a two beautiful emojis.</p>
      <p><i>"Ciro is Leo's carbon copy. Might be the one to show interest in the round leather game later," </i>another fan said.</p>
      <p>And of course, some Ronaldo's fans see nothing spectacular about the video.</p>

      <p>Outside the pitch, if anything would be said about the Liverpool forward, apparently it would about his gladsome humbleness which has marked him out as a special breed.</p>
