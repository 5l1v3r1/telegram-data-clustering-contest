      <h1>How Jada Pinkett Smith made Red Table Talk the chat show to beat</h1>

      <p>In March 2019, an event occurred that had everybody glued to their screens.</p>
      <p>A huge showbiz scandal, which had been played out via source quotes and cryptic Instagram unfollowings, was coming to a head via an interview with the person at the centre of the drama, and 33 million of us tuned in to find out what she had to say.</p>
      <p>Only it wasn’t on television. <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/01/jordyn-woods-breaks-silence-on-tristan-thompson-cheating-scandal-on-red-table-talk-8790004/">The interview, with Jordyn Woods, aired on Facebook Watch,</a> and it attracted 7.5 million views in the first 24 hours. That’s over four times the amount of people who watched Emily Maitlis interview <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> on BBC Newsnight, the same audience as Strictly Come Dancing 2019’s opening episode, and nearly a million more viewers than the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/great-british-bake-off/">Great British Bake Off</a> final.</p>
      <p>The person who managed to bring all of those people to Facebook Watch? Jada Pinkett Smith, who secured the first interview with Jordyn Woods after her kiss with Khloe Kardashian’s boyfriend <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tristan-thompson/">Tristan Thompson</a> for her Facebook Watch series Red Table Talk.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>It was guaranteed ratings gold. Jordyn – Kylie Jenner’s best friend – was reported to have kissed Tristan, the partner and baby daddy of Kylie’s big sister Khloe, at a house party. It was all celebrity gossip and reality TV fans could talk about for weeks. So when they were teased with a shot of Jordyn – a family friend of the Smiths – sitting at the red table, millions were ready to tune in when Red Table Talk went live.</p>

      <p>Jordyn then spilled the tea with Jada – that she did not have an affair with Tristan – and the ratings rolled in.</p>
      <p>But Red Table Talk isn’t a one-off ratings hit. The very first episode of the series, which aired in May 2018 and saw Jada chatting with her husband Will’s ex-wife Sheree Elizabeth Zampino, has racked up 31 million views. The two series so far, across 46 episodes, have racked up 482 million views, with an average viewership of 10.47 million viewers per episode.</p>
      <p>Sure, a Facebook view isn’t the same as a TV industry view – Facebook counts the total number of people who watch at least one minute of their show, rather than the US TV industry standard of the average minute audience. But when considering that Game Of Thrones, arguably the biggest series of the decade, averaged at 44.2 million an episode, Red Table Talk’s Facebook Watch figures don’t look too shabby.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The concept of Red Table Talk is as follows – Jada, the matriarch of the Smith family and star of films including The Matrix and Girls Trip, is joined by her mother Adrienne Banfield-Norris and her 19-year-old daughter Willow around the aforementioned red table to discuss a variety of hot topics. These topics can range from sex habits to self-harm, and often involve a special guest at the table.</p>
      <p>Celebrities who have joined the trio of women include Leah Remini, who discussed Scientology, Ellen Pompeo, who talked interracial marriage, and Sex and The City’s Kristin Davis, who, as the mum of two adopted black children, addressed whether white people should adopt black kids.</p>

      <p>Most recently, Demi Moore was joined by two of her daughters around the red table as they discussed her addiction issues, while Robyn Crawford also stopped by to talk about her relationship with Whitney Houston – leading to Jada opening up about her own relationship with Tupac Shakur.</p>
      <p>And today, the Red Table hosts one of its most fascinating interviews yet – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/t-will-red-table-talk-discuss-controversy-daughters-hymen-checked-11179733/">T.I. in his first interview</a> since he revealed on a podcast that he gets his 18-year-old daughter’s hymen checked every year to ensure she’s still a virgin.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>It’s a daytime talk show where the host has stories that are equally as fascinating, or even moreso, as the guest’s – like Loose Women, but A-list. The format is far from breaking the wheel, but there is something about Red Table Talk that brings people away from their tellies and over to their computers or phones to watch a traditional half hour episode of chat.</p>
      <p>Jada is a hugely successful, well connected woman, so it’s no surprise that she can bag high profile guests. But Red Table Talk’s appeal doesn’t appear to be down to the status of the guests. The Demi Moore episode had 4.3 million views, while Alicia Keys’ episode had 4.2m. Meanwhile, an episode about forced child marriage was viewed 6.6 million times, and an episode on domestic violence racked up 11.8 million views in a year.</p>

      <p>The gold within the show is the Smiths themselves. Will, Jada and their kids Willow and Jaden are one of the most famous families in Hollywood, with each of them commanding their own space in the industry. Will is a Grammy award winning rapper, Oscar nominated actor and star of Fresh Prince of Bel Air; Jada is a successful actress, singer and businesswoman; Jaden, 21, released his second album this year and has starred in The Get Down and The Karate Kid; and Willow, 19, is the BET Award-nominated singer behind Whip My Hair with three albums under her belt.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>As with all celeb dynasties, things aren’t perfect. Jada met Will when he was married to Sheree Zampino, the mother of his son, Trey. The couple have been plagued by rumours for years that they are in an open relationship.</p>
      <p>But it’s how the Smiths address these topics on Red Table Talk that make them so likeable and so accessible, unlike many celeb families out there with similar platforms.</p>
      <p>The very first episode of Red Table Talk saw Jada sitting down with her husband’s ex-wife to address their blended family. <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/21/jada-pinkett-smith-unhealthy-relationship-porn-will-smith-marriage-9619641/">Jada has discussed her own porn addiction</a>, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/22/jada-pinkett-smith-confronts-will-smith-drinking-alcohol-reaction-priceless-10786107/">questioned her husband on the show about his drinking</a>, as well as talking about the low points in their marriage. Adrienne shared the details of her heroin addiction. <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/15/plunged-black-hole-willow-smith-reveals-self-harmed-aged-12-7546379/">Willow told her mum on the show that she used to self-harm</a> following the success of Whip My Hair. Jada invited vocal anti-Scientologist Leah Remini on the show to discuss rumours the Smiths are Scientologists.</p>
      <p>Instead of talking about other people’s problems and skirting around their own, Red Table Talk sees the Smiths using themselves as examples and case studies. The show is basically a therapy session for the family that we are all invited to, which was pretty much the next step in allowing the cameras into a family home.</p>
      <p>Perhaps that’s why celebrities trust them so much in telling their stories in times of crisis or controversy. Jada isn’t there to judge or to grill – she’s a mediator on the red table which has hosted some of her own private issues being laid bare. Her marriage has been under the microscope for years, and now she is regaining control of the narrative by being brutally honest; maybe she can do the same for her guests in their times of scandal.</p>
      <p>When Jada opened the series by addressing whether she was a homewrecker, we knew that no topic was off limits. It’s that candid honesty that keeps us all coming back for more, and that keeps guests signing up for a seat at the Red Table. Red Table Talk may not be on the TV, but Jada is fast becoming one of the queens of the chat show.</p>
