      <h1>Kim Kardashian Explains the Real Reason She’s Wrapping Up Her Naked Selfie Era</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:07:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:07</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>The 2010s are ending and so too is the era of Kim Kardashian's regular <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/g28126/kim-kardashian-naked-selfies/">naked selfies</a>. Despite the reality star's <a href="https://www.papermag.com/kim-kardashian-promises-nude-selfies-till-i-die-1803310639.html">one-time promise</a> of "nude selfies till I die," Kardashian explained to <i><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/11/kim-kardashian-west-on-her-decade-of-multi-platform-fame.html">The Cut</a> </i>that she's decided to scale back on the sexy photos. It's not because Kanye West suddenly no longer likes <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29459369/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-met-gala-dress-fight/">his wife dressing so sexy</a> in public—it's because of her kids and the political work she's trying to do.</p>
      <p>Kardashian was candid about the coverage of her dressing more conservatively.</p>
      <blockquote>I saw this whole thing where it’s like, 'She’s so demure, and she’s covered, and I was like, "Guys, I had a shearling coat on and a turtleneck because it’s, like, freezing." But I think I have [covered up] a little bit. I don’t know if it’s the fact that my husband has voiced that sometimes too sexy is just overkill and he’s not comfortable with that. I listen to him and understand him. Still, at the end of the day, he always gives me the freedom to be and do what I want. But I have kind of had this awakening myself. I realized I could not even scroll through Instagram in front of my kids without full nudity coming up on my feed pretty much all the time. And I definitely contributed to that. I mean, one of my most iconic covers was the <i>Paper</i> magazine one, when I was all oiled up and ripping my dress off. I also did think, like, <i>Okay, I’m here in the White House</i> <i>and then the next day I was posting, like, a crazy bikini selfie.</i> And I was thinking, <i>I hope they don’t see this.</i> I have to go back there next week.</blockquote>
      <p>Kardashian continued, "I think I’m evolving to where I don’t feel the need to want to keep up," she said. "Not that I did it to feel like I had to keep up, but I guess I just don’t care as much anymore to want to take tons of photos in a thong bikini…now I’m just like, “Let’s actually live in real time and enjoy it. If we happen to get a photo, great.”</p>
      <p>Kanye West made headlines in October for an argument he had with Kardashian over her 2019 Met Gala dress looking too sexy. <i>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</i> shot footage of their argument.</p>

      <p>West, who had become more religious recently, <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29459369/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-met-gala-dress-fight/">explained on the show</a>, "I went through this transition where being a rapper, looking at all these girls and looking at my wife, like, ‘Oh my girl needs to be just like the other girls showing their body off.’ I didn’t realize that that was affecting my soul and my spirit as someone who is married and the father of now…about to be four kids. A corset is a form of underwear, it’s hot, for who though?" Kardashian responded then that "you built me up to be this sexy person and confidence and all this, and just because you’re on a journey and transformation doesn’t mean I’m in the same spot with you."</p>
      <p>Kardashian also spoke to <i>The Cut </i>about society being more accepting of plastic surgery and body modification, and her own experience researching procedures. "The Instagram accounts from surgeons are something that I love to go through," Kardashian said. "The one thing that only my close circle knows is that I love to research every single procedure to know exactly what’s out there. And people call me all the time, like really famous people, out of the blue and are like, 'I know we don’t know each other, but I’ve heard you’re the expert and I’m looking to do <i>x, y, </i>and <i>z.</i> Who would you recommend?' And I’ll be like, 'Actually, I’ve just researched this!' I’ll meet with doctors and be like, 'So when I’m 50, do you think my neck is going to, like…? What’s the best way to do it?'"</p>
