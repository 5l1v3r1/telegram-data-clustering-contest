      <p>Sex Education season two is now officially in sight and by in sight we mean it’s charging at us ready for an early 2020 release date.</p>
      <p>The surprise hit of 2019 is by far the best teen drama since Skins, following awkward Otis Milburn (Asa Butterfield), who becomes Moordale High <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/school/">School</a>’s resident sex therapist, reluctantly following his mother’s (Gillian Anderson) footsteps despite never actually having sex himself.</p>
      <p>However, this time around Otis has a girlfriend and the question is: can he practise what he preaches? We’ll find out when series 2 lands on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> on January 17, 2020.</p>

      <p>With a chlamydia outbreak storming through the school like some unfortunate STI riddled tidal wave, no doubt Otis and his ‘business partner’ Maeve ( Emma Margaret Tachard-Mackey) will have class mates queueing around the yard for much needed sexual, and medicinal, advice.</p>

      <p>Adam (Connor Swindells) is now miles away in a military camp, struggling to come to terms with his sexuality after pulling Eric during detention.</p>
      <p>As for Eric, alongside Otis, he appears to be distracting himself by perusing more needless but problematic adventures, while Maeve’s ex-boyfriend Jackson (Kedar Williams-Stirling) is still tormented by his parents piling on the pressure to become the next Michael Phelps.</p>
      <p>Season two will welcome super intelligent but unlucky in love pupil Viv (Chinenye Ezeudu), French head-turner Rahim (Sami Outalbali) and Maeve’s new next door neighbour, Isaac (George Robertson).</p>
