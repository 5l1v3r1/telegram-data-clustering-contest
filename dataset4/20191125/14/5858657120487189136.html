      <h1>CN Rail strike prompts frustration from farmers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:44:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:44</time> by <a rel="author">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>MONTREAL – The strike by more than three-thousand CN Rail workers has stalled commodities and frustrated farmers who rely on propane to dry their grain and heat their barns and greenhouses.</p>
      <p>The sense of urgency around the week-long strike’s ripple effects continues to grow.</p>
      <p>Today, hundreds of Quebec farmers marched through the streets of Montreal alongside a convoy of tractors to dump heaps of corn at the steps of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s riding office.</p>
      <p>They’re calling on Ottawa to resolve the labour stoppage that has idled trains across the country.</p>
      <p>Pascal Leduc, a corn producer from north of Montreal, says half his crop lies in the fields because a full silo prevents him from harvesting it while winter snows threaten to blanket it and leave the yield unusable.</p>
      <p>He says he doesn’t want to lose his crop.</p>
      <p>On another front, Canada’s largest potash mine announced today it will temporarily shut down and lay off 550 employees as a result of the strike.</p>
      <p>Fertilizer giant Nutrien has notified workers that its mine in southeastern Saskatchewan will halt operations for two weeks starting December 2nd.</p>
      <p>The vast majority of the Rocanville mine’s product is shipped by C-N Rail, which is now operating at 10 per cent capacity.</p>
      <p>The announcement comes two days after news broke of 70 short-term layoffs at C-N’s auto terminal in the Halifax area due to halted car shipments.</p>
