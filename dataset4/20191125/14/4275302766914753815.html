      <h2>An iconic building in Kirkcaldy High Street will be turned into a pub when two more stores leave the Lang Toun.</h2>

      <p>Amber Taverns has applied for change of use permission in relation to 85-95 High Street, which is currently a department store occupied by Burton and Dorothy Perkins.</p>
      <p>As it emerged the clothing chains are looking to vacate the premises, Amber Taverns want to spend a six-figure sum on refurbishing the three-storey B-listed art deco building and open it as public house.</p>
      <p>According to plans submitted to Fife Council, the name Montagues has been chosen for the proposed pub in tribute to Raymond Montague Burton – in order to draw attention to the history of the prominent building.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Colliers International, which is acting as agents for the applicant, noted that a number of listed buildings are currently at risk in Kirkcaldy High Street, and added: “As the current retailer no longer has the market to operate from Kirkcaldy, it is essential that the Burton’s Building is not added to this list, particularly as the building is already falling into disrepair in its current use.</p>
      <p>“The majority of the buildings at risk formally offered High Street functions.</p>
      <p>“There is no longer demand for these uses on the High Street and therefore it is essential that new, viable uses are found in order to activate the High Street and maintain these buildings in the long term.</p>
      <p>If approved, the development is likely to create between 15 and 20 full and part time jobs.</p>
      <p>Amber Taverns say the building in question is the only viable site in the town for its plans.</p>
