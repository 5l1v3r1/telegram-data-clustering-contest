      <p><b>MUMBAI: </b>Subhash Chandra, the media baron who rode India’s tumultuous media and entertainment scene to make <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/zee-entertainment-enterprises-ltd/stocks/companyid-11769.cms">Zee Entertainment Enterprises</a> (ZEE) one of India’s biggest media groups, on Monday quit as chairman of the company which he founded in 1992 after watching CNN make a big splash with satellite television. He will, however, continue as a non-executive board member, ZEE said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The resignation comes days after Chandra’s family saw its stake in ZEE fall to 5% following a series of mistimed and expensive infrastructure bets. Chandra’s investment companies had borrowed heavily from mutual funds and non-bank firms to fund road and renewable energy projects.</p>
      <p>The family had pledged ZEE shares to obtain these loans but was forced to sell and repay after lenders threatened to offload them in the market in case of a default.</p>
      <p>The Chandra family’s stake in ZEE has come down to 5% now from 41% a year ago while the shares have fallen 27% year to date. On Monday, they ended 5.33% lower at ₹339, ahead of the resignation.</p>
      <p>
        <b>NEW DIRECTORS</b>
      </p>
      <p>ZEE said in a statement that Chandra stepped down to fulfil the requirements of Regulation 17 (lB) of SEBI Listing Regulations, which mandated that the chairperson of the board shall not be related to the managing director or the chief executive officer of the company.</p>
      <p>The ZEE board inducted three independent directors – former finance secretary R Gopalan, ex-head of Intelligence Bureau Surinder Singh and art aficionado Aparajita Jain in lieu of two independent directors Niharika Vora and Sunil Sharma as well as nominee director of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Essel-Group">Essel Group</a> Subodh Kumar. After reconstitution, the board now has six independent directors besides two members from the Essel Group —Chandra and his son Punit Goenka.</p>
      <p>“The reconstitution of the board was to strengthen and induct independent members with varied experiences to build value and provide a strong signal to the existing and new institutional investors who have recently reposed their faith in the intrinsic value of the company,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>TAKEOVER TARGET?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The resignation seemingly creates a vacuum at the top of the board. Punit Goenka continues to be the MD and CEO but the board will soon have to appoint a chairman and is expected to do so in its next meeting. It also raises the question of whether Chandra’s resignation and the fall in the family’s holding will entice a hostile bid from rival media and entertainment groups.</p>
      <p>What makes ZEE attractive is its 20% market share in India’s entertainment market, programming content in 12 languages and a billion plus viewers across more than 100 countries. An attractive price could make investors hand over shares to a new bidder though hostile takeovers have rarely succeeded in India and the news and entertainment business is a highly sensitive sector.</p>
      <p>Chandra is likely to continue to enjoy political heft and clout despite the apparent loss of control of ZEE. The long battle to save the company and prevent a precipitous collapse in share price and stake may have sapped his financial strength but the new bidder will also have to contend with ZEE’s existing investors, especially ones who have been around for a long time and are considered close to the Chandra family.</p>
      <p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Invesco">Invesco</a> Oppenheimer, now the largest shareholder in ZEE with almost 19% stake, has been a ZEE investor since 2002. For any interested party seeking control of ZEE, it is essential to reach out to the fund. Another large chunk is with Singapore governmentbacked GIC, which now owns around 8.5%.</p>
      <p>“The basic rule for any hostile takeover is that you pick up 26% and then do an open offer. In ZEE’s case, there are only a few big institutional investors like Invesco Oppenheimer that can deliver a big block. But given their long relationship (with the promoters) and the fact that they rely on the promoter family to run the business, it is difficult to imagine,” said advocate Sudip Mahapatra, partner at law firm S&amp;R Associates and an expert on M&amp;As.</p>
      <p>“ZEE is an attractive opportunity, but a hostile takeover is highly unlikely. For all practical purposes, the promoters will continue to run the show,” said Rohit Dokania, senior VP – research, IDFC Securities.</p>
      <p>
        <b>THREE-DECADE REIGN</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chandra’s move brings an end to a successful, near-three decade reign as boss of Zee Entertainment, India’s first satellite television company. He successfully built ZEE into an entertainment conglomerate in face of stiff competition from Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing’s Star, which was later taken over by Rupert Murdoch, and the local arm of Japan’s Sony Corporation. He launched India’s first dish TV firm and promoted a controversial, short-lived T20 cricket league, forcing the Indian cricket board to come up with the now-famous Indian Premier League (IPL).</p>
      <p>“Chandra has been the original media entrepreneur in India...He is the towering personality, and even if he steps down today, I am sure a newer innings is waiting to happen. He has got too much fire in his belly. He is too young to hang up boots,” said Sameer Nair, CEO, Applause Entertainment. As former CEO of Star India, Nair often sparred with Chandra’s Zee in the late 1990s and early years of the 21st century.</p>
