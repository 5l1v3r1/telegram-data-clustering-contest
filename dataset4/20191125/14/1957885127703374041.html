      <h1>Games of the Decade: Clash Royale - less a game, more of a place</h1>
      <h2>Cards across.</h2>

      <p>I love Brighton, where I live, with a passion. Which is to say that I'm always falling in and out of love with it. Sometimes it is too much. Sometimes it is just right. Sometimes I cannot face it in the morning. Sometimes I think I never want to leave.</p>
      <p>This is where Clash Royale lives, I think. It is one of those games that is less an activity and more simply the place where I find myself. Clash Royale is the place where I live. I play it on buses, in cabs, on the sofa, in the queue at Tesco's. I play it at my desk and I play it sometimes in meetings. And always that shuffling in and out of affections with it: I love it. It's too much. It's just right. I cannot face it.</p>
      <p>I always wanted a game like this - something where I could spend a long time learning and getting better at. Yet it seems so simple! Clash Royale is a multiplayer game in which two players - or four - meet on a board with a set of towers at each end. I try to take down your towers. You try to take down mine. At the end of three minutes, who is the winner?</p>
      <p>You take down these towers by playing cards. Spells, buildings, troops. Spells might be a lightning bolt or a giant snowball - I think that one is a spell. Buildings might be a zappy turret or a goblin in a cage. Troops? Troops are all sorts.</p>

      <p>There are 95 cards by this point, and you take them into battle in the form of a deck of eight. That eight is the magic number. Hearthstone's thirty cards is the reason I quit: I couldn't hold that much in my head. Eight is where things get interesting. Suddenly I can think about the basics of deck building: where's my attack and where's my defence? Suddenly I can try stupid stuff, like a deck of really cheap cards or a deck of absolute monsters. 95 cards, and I honestly think I've used them all at one point or another. And I have weekends where I'm gripped by sudden manias. Heal is a lovely card - a honeyish elixir that seems to glow. It radiates! Put it down and any troops in its range will be healed as long as they <i>stay</i> in its range. I spent three days recently as an absolute Heal monster. That has passed. I don't use it anymore.</p>
      <p>I'm in a clan, which I never thought would happen, and I'm in the end-game, which I also never thought would happen. I also read about the game constantly and watch videos and read balance notes and do all that jazz. Clash Royale could just about be the only game I ever played, but of course it works so well because it's more like the mortar than the bricks. It's the game that keeps all the other games separated.</p>
      <p>Actually forget all that brick and mortar stuff. Let's stick with my first thought. Clash Royale is the place where I live. I am always in there somewhere.</p>
