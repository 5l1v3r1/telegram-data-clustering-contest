      <p>Former Olympic shooting champion Michael Diamond may need a heart transplant and is selling a second gold medal to support his family.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old’s ambitions of competing at a seventh Olympics in Tokyo next year ended after heart failure left him in a Newcastle hospital.</p>
      <p>According to <i>New Idea</i>, Diamond’s health problems started about a month ago when he suffered a shortness of breath with tests revealing his heart was only functioning at 15 per cent.</p>
      <p>“It was bizarre and alarming,” Diamond told the magazine.</p>
      <p>Doctors then told Diamond, who won gold at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and four years later in Sydney, he was in line for a heart transplant.</p>
      <p>“I thought, ‘I’m too young for that’,” the father-of-three said. “This is the greatest fight of my life.”</p>
      <p>“It’s a pretty sobering feeling to have your heart fail on you.</p>
      <blockquote>I do want to hang around – I want to see my kids get older and get married and I want to have grandchildren.”</blockquote>
      <p>Separated from his wife Cathy, Diamond has three daughters and is selling his Atlanta gold medal to support them after selling his Sydney gold two years ago for $72,000.</p>
      <p>Diamond’s career went off the rails in 2016 following an alleged domestic dispute and high-range drink-driving charge.</p>
      <p>He was then convicted for firearms offences, which carried a ban from holding a gun licence so he missed the 2016 Rio Olympics.</p>
      <p>Diamond successfully appealed against the conviction a year later.</p>
      <p>He felt the stress may have contributed to his heart issues.</p>
      <p>“I was nervous and stressed out all the time,” Diamond said.</p>
      <p>“I believe everything has snowballed to how I am feeling today.”</p>
      <p>Diamond’s second trap shooting medal goes under the hammer on December 5 in Melbourne.</p>
      <p>“I still have bills and I’ve still got to survive,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got kids to worry about and I’m doing just that,”</p>
