      <p>The 9-year-old San Diego boy who <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/9-year-old-boy-fighting-for-his-life-after-san-diego-murder-suicide-relatives/">was the </a><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/9-year-old-boy-fighting-for-his-life-after-san-diego-murder-suicide-relatives/">was the sole survivor</a><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/9-year-old-boy-fighting-for-his-life-after-san-diego-murder-suicide-relatives/"> survivor</a> after his father gunned down his mother and three brothers in a murder-suicide died over the weekend, according to a new report.</p>
      <p>Ezequiel Valdivia was left clinging to life after his dad José Valdivia, 31, shot and killed his mother Sabrina Rosario, 29; brothers Zeth Valdivia, 11, Zuriel Valdivia, 5, and Enzi Valdivia, 3, and then himself on Nov. 16 at the family’s home in the Paradise Hills neighborhood.</p>
      <p>Ezequiel sustained gunshot wounds to his head and leg and remained on life support in an intensive care unit for a week before he succumbed to his injuries Saturday night, his uncle, Karl Albright, <a href="https://fox5sandiego.com/2019/11/24/fourth-boy-dies-in-paradise-hills-murder-suicide/">confirmed to the local FOX 5 station</a>.</p>
      <p>“God wanted him to come home,” Albright told the outlet. “If he wanted him to stay, he’d be here. But he’s home with his family; they’re playing, they’re rollerblading, skating around, chasing Pokemon up in heaven.”</p>
      <p>The family has decided to donate Ezequiel’s organs, Albright said.</p>

      <p>“It’s a tragic thing for us, but if we can turn that around for anybody else, that’s all we ask,” the grieving uncle told the station.</p>

      <p>Before the shooting, Sabrina had recently obtained a restraining order against Jose, and police had visited the home at least once before to “preserve the peace,” reports said.</p>
      <p>Sabrina’s sister, Jocelyn Rosario, claimed that Jose struggled to accept that the couple was headed for divorce and began stalking his wife, telling her that he had suicidal thoughts, according to reports. Valdivia also sent Sabrina photos of alcohol and a gun, according to Rosario.</p>
      <p>A GoFundMe page launched by Albright after the murders to help cover Ezequiel’s medical expenses raised more than $57,000 by Monday morning — exceeding its $50,000 goal.</p>
