      <p>Rob McBride, from Ellesmere, was invited to take part in a segment of Plant a Tree to Save the World which was hosted by broadcaster John Humphrys.</p>
      <p>He joined the ITN filming crew at a private estate in Kent to visit the largest maiden oak in Europe.</p>
      <p>It was a tree that Rob, who is best known locally as the Tree Hunter, has been longing to see for more than a decade.</p>
      <p>"People are now realising just how important trees are to our future," Rob said.</p>
      <p>"I was invited by the Woodland Trust to discuss how trees can have a positive affect on our mental health.</p>
      <p>"We went down to a private estate in Kent to see this oak and it was fantastic. I have always wanted to see it.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to ruin the surprise but when people see it on TV they will understand why it is so magnificent."</p>
      <p>Rob said he feels incredibly privileged to have been invited to take part.</p>
      <p>"This is something I'm really passionate about," he said.</p>
      <p>"It's my hobby first and foremost and I work in Tesco Whitchurch to fund all the work and research I do so to be able to take part in things like this is amazing. I feel very privileged to do it.</p>
      <p>"Meeting John Humphreys was brilliant too. We got along really well and had a good laugh. I even got in some of my best tree puns so I'll be interested to see if they make the cut."</p>
      <p>The first part of the documentary airs at 8pm on November 28.</p>
