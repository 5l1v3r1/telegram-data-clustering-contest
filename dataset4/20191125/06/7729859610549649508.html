        <b>Team NXT dominated Survivor Series, winning four of their matches to take overall brand victory.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Shayna Baszler</b> forced <b>Bayley</b> to tap out in a main-event match, which also included <b>Becky Lynch</b>, to collect the fourth win for the Wednesday night crew and give them the win.</p>
      <p>SmackDown banked two victories with Raw taking just one, and although Lynch drove Baszler through a table after the match, the night was a glorious success for NXT and their women's champion.</p>
      <p><b>Rey Mysterio</b> narrowly missed out on a major upset in his No Holds Barred match against <b>Brock Lesnar</b> but The Beast ultimately prevailed.</p>
      <p>Mysterio and his son Dominick dropped Lesnar with several shots with a lead pipe before tandem 619 and frog splashes but the WWE champion kicked off of the pin attempt and hit an F5 on Rey for the win.</p>
      <p>NXT star <b>Keith Lee</b> enjoyed what could turn out to be a breakout performance for him in the men's five-against-five elimination match, which boiled down to him against <b>Roman Reigns</b>.</p>
      <p>Ultimately it was Reigns who picked up the win for SmackDown with a Spear but Lee came close to victory before missing a second-rope moonsault and comes away from the event with his reputation enormously enhanced.</p>

      <p><b>The Fiend</b> made the first defence of his Universal title and although <b>Daniel Bryan</b> had some strong moments the championship remains firmly around the waist of Bray Wyatt's supernatural creation.</p>
      <p>With the ring bathed in the red light which has become The Fiend's tradition, he sank Bryan with a Mandible Claw to retain the gold.</p>
      <p>A very strong performance from <b>Rhea Ripley</b> gave Team NXT the win in the women's triple threat five-on-five match.</p>

      <p>The rising Australian star, who pinned Charlotte Flair on Raw last week, benefited from some assistance from <b>Io Shirai</b> and <b>Candice Le Rae</b>, this time beat <b>Sasha Banks</b> to win it for the black-and-gold team.</p>
      <p>In a brutal match, <b>Adam Cole</b> retained the NXT Championship with a Last Shot on <b>Pete Dunne</b> and his Undisputed Era colleague <b>Roderick Strong</b> won a triple threat against Intercontinental champion <b>Shinsuke Nakamura</b> and United States champion <b>AJ Styles</b>.</p>
      <p>On the event's pre-show, the <b>Viking Raiders</b> proved their superiority by beating SmackDown champions <b>The New Day</b> and NXT title-holders <b>Kyle O'Reilly &amp; Bobby Fish</b>, and <b>Lio Rush</b> retained the NXT cruiserweight title with victory over <b>Akira Tozawa</b> (Raw) and <b>Kalisto</b> (SmackDown).</p>
