      <h1>Analysts, Gamers, and Blade Runner's Artistic Director React To The Look of Tesla's Cybertruck</h1>

      <p>Syd Mead, the artistic director on <i>Blade Runner</i> says Tesla's new Cybertruck "has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/blade-runners-syd-mead-says-cybertruck-exceeds-expectations-2019-11">completely changed the vocabulary of the personal truck market design</a>."<br/><br/>Or, for another perspective, "Tesla's Cybertruck looks weird... like, really weird," wrote Toni Sacconaghi, a senior equity research analyst at the global asset management firm AllianceBernstein. "Add a little bit of dirt, and you could even say it gives off a retro-future vibe a la Mad Max."<br/><br/>That's from a Market Insider article citing Wall Street analysts they say "<a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-cybertruck-analyst-reaction-live-demo-wall-street-puzzled-appearance-2019-11-1028712126">aren't buying the futuristic design of Tesla's new electric pickup truck</a>." For example, Dan Levy of Credit Suisse, who wrote "amid the radical design for Cybertruck, it's somewhat unclear to us who the core buyer will be." <i>"We do not see this vehicle in its current form being a success," Jeffrey Osborne of Cowen wrote in a note on Friday, adding that he doesn't see the Tesla brand or the Cybertruck design "resonating with existing pickup truck owners...." <br/><br/>Still, the Cybertruck's design wasn't unanimously disliked by Wall Street. The design "will be a hit with the company's fanatic EV installed base globally as Musk &amp; Co. are clearly thinking way out of the box on this model design," Dan Ives of Wedbush wrote in a Friday note....<br/><br/>[And] "While styling will always be subjective, we believe the unique and futuristic design will resonate with consumers, leading to solid demand," Jed Dorsheimer of Canaccord Genuity wrote in a Friday note.</i> <br/>The article also quotes Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein as saying that the "really futuristic, like cyberpunk Blade Runner" design "is too bad, because its on-paper specs are insane."<br/><br/>But IGN reports there's another group commenting enthusiastically on the Cybertruck's looks: gamers. <i>Unlike anything else we've seen from Musk's line of vehicles before, the Tesla truck resembles something you'd see in an old video game set in the future or sci-fi flick from the late '90s to the early 2000s.<br/><br/>Of course, gamers all over the internet couldn't help themselves from <a href="https://me.ign.com/en/pc/167898/feature/tesla-cybertruck-gamers-poke-fun-at-elon-musks-low-poly-truck">sharing images, making memes, and drawing comparisons</a> to look-alikes we've seen in games, TV shows, and movies... According to the internet, the Tesla Cybertruck either hasn't finished rendering yet or is made of some very dated graphics. Either way, it takes us back to the days where we got to experience the famous low-poly Lara Croft.</i></p>
