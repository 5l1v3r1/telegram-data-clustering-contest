      <p>Grapevine has it that Vijay Sethupathi is likely to play a negative role in <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/kamal-haasan/">Kamal Haasan</a>-starrer Indian 2, directed by Shankar.</p>
      <p>Multiple reports suggest that Sethupathi is “almost on board, and will be shooting for his portions from February 2020”. However, an official word is awaited. It looks like the actor will join the sets of Indian 2 once he completes Thalapathy 64.</p>
      <p>At a recent event, Vijay Sethupathi had revealed that he was offered a crucial character in Indian 2, but couldn’t accept it owing to date issues.</p>
      <p>For now, Indian 2 actor Kamal Haasan is on a break following surgery for the removal of an implant in his leg. However, Shankar is shooting for the film and is keen to complete majority of the portions by the time Haasan recovers.</p>
      <p>At a recent event, Shankar had revealed Haasan will be speaking in Gujarati in Indian 2. Ulaganayagan, who was present at the event, went on to speak a line in Gujarati on the stage, which was well received by the audience.</p>
      <p>While Kajal Aggarwal is playing the lead, we learn Priya Bhavani Shankar will play Kamal Haasan’s wife, reprising Suganya’s role in the original. The Monster fame actor will appear as an octogenarian, according to a source.</p>
      <p>Bankrolled by Lyca Productions, Indian 2 also stars Anil Kapoor, Siddharth, Rakul Preet, Bobby Simhaa and Vivekh. According to sources, Rakul Preet is paired opposite Siddharth and will play his love interest.</p>
      <p>A while ago, the team, led by Peter Hein, had shot important action sequences in Bhopal and Gwalior. The budget of the action sequences was pegged at Rs 40 crore.</p>
      <p>Indian 2 has music by Anirudh Ravichander and cinematography by Rathnavelu. The cameraman had worked with Shankar in <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/rajinikanth/">Rajinikanth</a>-starrer Enthiran.</p>
