        <b>Lindsay Lohan 's ex Harry Morton has been found dead at his home, passing away at the age of 38.</b>
      </p>
      <p>TMZ reports that the Pink Taco founder has died after being found unresponsive at his home by a relative on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Harry was pronounced dead at his Beverly Hills home, according to the publication.</p>
      <p>It's said that foul play is not suspected and an autopsy will be carried out to determine the cause of his death.</p>
      <p>Harry famously dated Mean Girls actress Lindsay in 2006, but the relationship fizzled out.</p>
      <p>The businessman was also romantically linked to Demi Moore, Britney Spears and Paris Hilton at various stages.</p>
      <p>Reports also linked him to Jennifer Aniston and Hayden Panettiere, according to TMZ.</p>
      <p>Harry also bought The Viper Room in 2008, where actor River Phoenix died of an overdose in 1993, but is said to have sold it.</p>
      <p>He was the son of Hard Rock Cafe co-founder Peter Morton and his grandfather Arnie was also in the restaurant business and co-founded Morton's Steakhouse back in 1978.</p>
      <p>Harry founded Pink Taco when he was just 18 years old.</p>
      <p>Harry also owned Elvis Presley's former Beverly Hills estate, but it is not believed that Harry died at that residence.</p>
      <p>Following his death Lindsay's mom Dina is said to have posted an image of her daughter with Harry to Instagram, writing: "RIP Harry God has an angel, we love you!</p>
      <p>"Prayers to the family."</p>
      <p>Lindsay is yet to respond to the news of her ex-boyfriend's passing.</p>
