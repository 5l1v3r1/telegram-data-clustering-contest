      <h1>'Incorrect' legal advice responsible for Afterpay's AUSTRAC breaches</h1>

      <p>An independent audit by the financial crimes regulator has blamed an unnamed top tier law firm for "incorrect" advice given to Afterpay that resulted in breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) laws.</p>
      <p>The $8 billion valued buy now pay later service on Monday released findings from the 300 page audit to the ASX. The summary from the report said there was no evidence of Afterpay actually being used for money laundering or terrorism financing despite numerous compliance breaches. Shares in the buy now pay later service rose 7 per cent to $32.64 on the news.</p>

      <p>"Despite Afterpay having a compliance-focused culture, the consequences of being provided with incorrect legal advice has resulted in historic non-compliance with the AML/CTF Act and Rules," said the report conducted by compliance expert Neil Jeans from Initialism.</p>
      <p>Experts estimated</p>
      <p>AUSTRAC confirmed it has received the auditor’s final report and said it will now examine the findings and recommendations.</p>
      <p>"It is not appropriate for AUSTRAC to comment further at this stage," said an AUSTRAC spokesman.</p>
      <p>The report noted that Afterpay is a "low risk business" in relation to its ability to used for money laundering or terrorism financing and said the nature of the business, "mitigates" these risks.</p>

      <p>The report also makes the finding that Afterpay's service is a "loan to consumers" saying the service "constitutes the provision of a loan and payment of a loan."</p>
      <p>Afterpay's service allows users to purchase goods with no upfront payment and then pay for the good in four equal installments. The company makes money through fees from merchants, as well as late fees from users.</p>
      <p>The company was under a regulatory cloud last year while ASIC reviewed the buy now, pay later sector amid arguments it was a credit provider and should come under the provisions of laws which would require it to perform credit checks on customers. It was an argument Afterpay rejected.</p>
      <p>The legal advice concluded Afterpay provided a factoring service for merchants whereby itacquired customer's receivables from merchants at a discount. "I am of the opinion this initial legal advice was incorrect," said Mr Jeans.</p>
      <p>The advice resulted in Afterpay developing its compliance framework based on merchants only and not usage by individuals.</p>
      <p>Afterpay was plunged into controversy in June this year when AUSTRAC ordered the independent audit just days after the company raised $317 million from investors and company founders sold $100 million worth of stock.</p>
