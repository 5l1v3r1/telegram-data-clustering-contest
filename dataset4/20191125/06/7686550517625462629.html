      <p>After a week in the jungle with very little food and not much sleep it is all starting to get a bit tense in the I'm a Celebrity camp.</p>
      <p>A heated argument over 'sexist' decisions descended into chaos when tearful Andrew Maxwell accused shouting Ian Wright of purposefully 'singling him out'.</p>
      <p>It all started with a tense debate over who who should get roast dinners ahead of an upcoming live trial - with Kate Garraway confronting James Haskell over "chivalrous nonsense".</p>
      <p>It all came to a head after it was announced that Andy, Kate, Myles and Nadine would be travelling into the Australian Bush, on a mission to win twelve care packages for camp.</p>
      <p>The rest were to take part in a live trial, where they had the opportunity to win up to 12 stars.</p>
      <p>They had to come up with an ordered list and only those celebrities with a star next to their name at the end of the live trial would be allowed to visit the Jungle Dining Room where they will be served a roast dinner.</p>
      <p>It was up to the contestants to decide the order in which the stars are allocated. The first star won will go to the celebrity in position 1, the second star won will go to the celebrity in position 2 and so on. The celebrities then had to decide in which order they were placing everyone for the roast dinner on the board that was in camp.</p>
      <p>Myles suggested the ladies of the camp went in the top five spots, Kate was happy to go further down but they all wanted ladies at the top so decided on (in order) Adele, Jacqueline, Nadine, Caitlyn and Kate.</p>

      <p>Andy W put his name at the bottom of the board. They all eventually agreed on James, Myles, Roman, Andrew, Ian, Cliff and Andy. The whole decision process was slightly tense as the celebrities were tired and hungry.</p>
      <p>James said: “Can we just all agree moving forward that for anything else and I think every man in here agrees that woman go first and cut all that chivalrous nonsense.”</p>
      <p>Kate snapped back: “But that is chivalrous nonsense.”</p>
      <p>James said: “You fight every time, just go with it.”</p>
      <p>Kate said “I’m allowed to have a view too.”</p>
      <p>As the camp began to clash, comedian Andrew said he did not like the way former football Ian kept speaking to him.</p>

        <figcaption>The pair did sort their differences out before taking part in the live trial<cite>(Image: ITV/REX/Shutterstock)</cite></figcaption>

      <p>Frustrated Andrew, 45, then stood up and said: “You keep shouting at me Ian.”</p>
      <p>Ian, 56, looked at him shocked and asked: “Who is shouting? When did I shout?”</p>
      <p>When Andrew told him it was "just then", Ian claimed: “I wasn’t even talking to you, what did I say?”</p>
      <p>In the Bush Telegraph, Roman Kemp admitted he was a little bit lost and did not understand how the situation had happened.</p>
      <p>Back in camp, Ian told Andrew: "What are you talking about? I didn’t shout at you."</p>
      <p>When Andrew asked why Ian was singling him out, Ian firmly denied that he was and asked the comedian to repeat what he had supposedly said. As things got heated, Andrew claimed he could not remember and was tired so walked to his bed.</p>
      <p>Ian was not happy with the situation, but Andrew then walked back to the football pundit and opened his arms to make up.</p>

        <figcaption>Andrew said he was feeling very emotional<cite>(Image: ITV/REX/Shutterstock)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Andrew said: “I’m sorry, I’m really tired, I don’t know, I’m really tired."</p>
      <p>When Andrew started to get emotional in front of Ian, the former Arsenal striker said: “Don’t cry.”</p>
      <p>Close to tears, apologetic Andrew confessed: "I’m not going to cry, I’m sorry."</p>
      <p>A tired and emotional Ian and Andrew both hugged each other as they settled their differences.</p>
      <p>“You’re my pal and I’m just really sensitive," admitted Andrew.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Andrew had got into an argument over the question in the Dingo Dollar challenge.</p>

      <p>Kiosk Kev called the celebrities back in main camp and asked "What % of adults do not trust politicians?’ a) 59% or b) 79%."</p>
      <p>Adele thought it would be 79%, Andrew thought lower.</p>
      <p>James asked for a show of hands any most of the celebrities thought 79% so James told Andy W to say that. Andrew said “Not everyone put their hands up.” James snapped back “they did’.”</p>
      <p>Andrew walked away and said “It’s just as shambolic as ever, we’re not getting chocolate.”</p>
      <p>Talking in the BT, James said "Everyone’s tired, everyone’s a bit chippy, everyone’s had a long day, things happen. I’m just mortified if he (Andrew) think I just closed him down."</p>
      <p>Nadine, Ian and Adele felt you should always go with your gut reaction to the Outback Shack questions. James spoke to Andrew away from the others to clear the air and they hugged it out.</p>
      <p>Talking in the BT, Andrew said "I said my piece, everyone said their piece and big James gave me a hug, job done."</p>
      <p>Roman and Kate came back and revealed they’d all won jelly beans, everyone cheered.</p>
      <p>Andrew did say: “Thank God for Adele, thank God people didn’t listen to me.”</p>

      <p>Later, eight of the celebrities took part in a series of Love Island themed challenges in the live trial and despite drinking a disgusting shake of blended pigs penis, Ian missed out on a roast dinner along with Andy and Cliff.</p>
