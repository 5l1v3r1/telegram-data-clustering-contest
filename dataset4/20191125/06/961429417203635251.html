        <b>A clinical commissioning group has switched health systems ahead of a merger next year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a move backed by NHS England and Improvement, Hambleton, Richmondshire and Whitby CCG will move from the North East and North Cumbria integrated care system to the Humber, Coast and Vale sustainability and transformation partnership from April 2020.</p>
      <p>The body, which purchases care for around 144,000 people, is due to merge with Harrogate and Rural District and Scarborough and Ryedale CCGs next year to form a new North Yorkshire CCG.</p>
      <p>The CCG told <i>HSJ</i> the move of HRW CCG means the new body “will be a member of two, rather than three, integrated care systems supported by NHSE”. All three CCGs are currently members of three separate systems, with Harrogate and Rural District part of the West Yorkshire and Harrogate ICS.</p>
      <p>The merged North Yorkshire CCG will be a part of West Yorkshire and Harrogate ICS and Humber, Coast and Vale STP.</p>
      <p>A statement added: “The CCG will continue to be involved in, and influence, commissioning and contractual flows for acute services in the North East for the local population.”</p>
      <p>
        <i>Updated 25 November 1.43pm: Corrected the second from last line, to correct the systems which North Yorkshire CCG will be a part of. </i>
