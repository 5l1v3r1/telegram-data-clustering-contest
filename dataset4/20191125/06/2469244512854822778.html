      <h1>Dad's 'demanding' rules to visit newborn son leave family furious</h1>
      <h2>The seven instructions have left people divided</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:55:33+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:55</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, Jamie Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>The parents of a dad as well as his in-laws have been left angry after he made a list of instructions when visiting his newborn son.</p>
      <p>The man and his wife welcomed a baby into the world and 'held off' on visits for the first day after he admitted he was a 'very anxious' new parent, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/family-lash-out-dads-list-20943776">The Mirror</a> reports.</p>
      <p>He explained that his and his wife's parents are very different, with his very 'old fashioned and thinking letting a child eat dirt is better than any vaccine'.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, he says his wife's family 'just have a tendency to be very me me me'.</p>
      <p>In an effort to nip any potential problems in the bud, the dad sent out an email laying down his visitation rules - but it's led to him being branded 'rude' and 'demanding'.</p>
      <p>
        <b>His rules were:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can't visit if you feel ill</li>
        <li>No children under 18 because 'schools are breeding grounds for viruses'</li>
        <li>Visitors to wear 'light' perfume or no perfume at all</li>
        <li>Always agree a visiting time first</li>
        <li>Visits only between the hours of 9am and 5pm</li>
        <li>No gifts because 'it'll be a hassle to bring home'</li>
        <li>Keep visits between 3-4 people at a time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>He  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/e0cxbn/aita_for_sending_an_email_out_with_guidelines_on/">wrote</a>  : "I felt a little overbearing, but my wife read it over and said it sounded fine."</p>
      <p>His aunt was the first to visit with her husband and two adult children, meaning his own parents are asked to wait outside when they arrived due to the rule stating a maximum of four visitors at one time.</p>

      <p>The aunt was 'polite and cut her time short', allowing his parents to meet their grandson for the first time.</p>
      <p>An hour later, with his parents still there, his wife's parents arrive with another grandson in tow.</p>
      <p>"My wife tells them that they can't bring him in," he says. "Their grandson starts to cry and my mother-in-law starts to scold us for forbidding children, so my father pipes up saying that we're being too coddling.</p>
      <p>"Then my mother starts up and tells us that we've been very rude and cold and says that as grandmother, it's her right to visit the baby when she pleases and she shouldn't have to 'RSVP' to her grandson's birth.</p>
      <p>"She calls me impolite for sending out a 'demanding' email like I did and insists that if I regulate my son as strictly as I did his visitings, he'll grow up resenting my wife and I.</p>
      <p>"We told them to go, and my mother told me she raised me too well to have me be so rude to my own family.</p>
      <p>"My mother-in-law said that if my wife didn't 'crack down on me', they'd never be visiting again.</p>
      <p>"My wife has changed her tune about the whole thing and thinks I was being too combative.</p>
      <p>"I really don't think I was that wrong in exercising my boundaries, and I think that them not listening is proof it was needed."</p>
      <p>After asking if he had been wrong to send out the list, the majority took his side, with one replying: "Most of this is pretty common sense.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately refusing to respect boundaries and having a sense of entitlement over the newborn doesn’t bode well for your future privacy and your wife’s recovery.</p>
      <p>"Please stand your ground. You need to do what is best for you, your wife and your new babe."</p>
      <p>Not everyone agreed, with another commenting: "You're the a**hole. You are being ridiculous."</p>
