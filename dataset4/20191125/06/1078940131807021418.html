      <p>LAHOR, Pakistan: Technology is becoming better, smarter and more affordable over time. Innovative features that were once synonymous with flagship devices are trickling down in midrange and entry-level smartphones. Lately, the midrange segment is burgeoning with a plethora of options giving people the chance to get the very best. Take for example, the HUAWEI Y9 Prime 2019 – a solid bestseller that captured the hearts and minds of consumers all over Pakistan. With its delicate design, outstanding display, long battery life, and impressive camera – it is a smartphone that amalgamated all the best flagship features into one.</p>
      <p>With the year coming to a close, Huawei is poised to make the best even better with a smartphone that will surely take the HUAWEI Y Series to a new high. While the anticipation builds up, here’s everything you need to look forward to.</p>

      <h3>Bigger and Better Brought By a 6.59-Inch FHD+ Ultra FullView Display</h3>
      <p>Our eyes are constantly glued to our smartphone screens and if the experience isn’t truly notch-less and immersive, then one can’t really enjoy their smartphone experience. With the HUAWEI Y9s, a 6.59” FHD+ Ultra FullView Display gives you a fuller, notch-less, edge-to-edge vibrant experience. It offers the most pixels-per-inch with 391 ppi that brings out true colours and sharp graphics.</p>
      <h3>Real Camera Performance with A 48MP Triple AI Camera</h3>
      <p>A good camera is generally the most significant aspect of a smartphone. With everyone trying to look good in their photos and capture some breathtaking shots, HUAWEI Y9s will be a must-have. It comes with a true 48MP + 8MP + 2MP Triple AI Camera setup at the back that lets you take Ultra Wide Angle photos. The Night Mode is also a killer feature. Not only that, but the 16MP pop-up front AI camera that debuted on the HUAWEI Y9 Prime 2019 appears on it as well – but only better. It lets you take dazzling selfies and bokeh shots, making you look your best!</p>
      <h3>Large Storage and Powerful Hardware</h3>
      <p>With more photos and videos to shoot and watch comes the need for a larger storage and faster performance. The HUAWEI Y9s keeps you covered in that domain with a massive 128GB storage (expandable to 512GB separately) and 6GB RAM. The entertainment doesn’t stop with the large 4,000 mAh battery that runs for around 1-2 days with the power efficient with the Kirin 710F.</p>
      <h3>A Glass Body Design to Make You Shine</h3>
      <p>The HUAWEI Y9s is meticulously crafted with 21 Levels Glass Craft* – offering the real bang for your buck with a 3D Arc Design. A side mounted fingerprint scanner makes accessing your phone convenient, superfast and secure.</p>
      <p>With such amazing features, the HUAWEI Y9s is quite a tease. Pre-orders for the smartphone will open in a week’s time while people can keep their anticipation running!!!</p>
