      <p>One of the major reasons for weight gain is slow body <a href="https://www.india.com/photos/health/are-you-gaining-weight-these-6-foods-make-your-metabolism-extremely-slow-and-lead-to-weight-gain-115361/alcohol-makes-your-metabolism-extremely-slow-115368/">metabolism</a>. And, regular consumption of amla juice can help in flushing out the toxins in the body associated with inadequate metabolism and boost fat burning.</p>
      <h3>Enhances synthesis of protein</h3>
      <p>It is needless to say that greater protein synthesis means effective weight loss. And, reduced protein synthesis decreases the body’s metabolism hence contributing to extra pounds. Daily intake of amla juice (no matter whether in concentrated and diluted form), can help in boosting your body’s rate of breaking protein.</p>
      <h3>Removes toxins</h3>

Amla juice removes these harmful toxins and helps in detoxing. It not only combats the reason for weight gain but also prevents further buildup of toxins. Consuming amla juice regularly can potentially increase your body’s digestion rate. Being rich in fiber, it can keep your gut healthy and help in fighting constipation, another reason for weight gain. Having amla daily can also reduce your risk of developing diabetes by reducing the level of sugar in the blood.</p>
      <h3>Increases satiety</h3>
      <p>Being rich in fiber, amla juice can keep you satisfied for a longer duration preventing you from overeating. This carbohydrate helps in keeping sugar level under check.</p>
