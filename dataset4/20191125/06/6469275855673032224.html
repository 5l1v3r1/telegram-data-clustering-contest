        <b>Residents in Fulwood are joining forces to fight against plans to tear down a community hub.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Proposals to demolish St Martin’s Chapel in Broadway, which was closed to the public in September, are sitting with planners at Preston City Council.</p>
      <p><b>READ MORE: </b><a href="https://www.lep.co.uk/your-lancashire/preston/fulwood/angry-demonstrations-after-plans-to-demolish-preston-church-hall-out-of-the-blue-1-9441275"><b>Angry demonstrations after plans to demolish Preston church hall 'out of the blue'<br/></b><br/></a>The church’s parochial church council (PCC) is seeking permission to build 14 new homes on the land as well as a new chapel or parish hall after the existing chapel building, Guides hut and bowling green are demolished.</p>
      <p>According to planning documents from the Parish of St John Baptist in Broughton which oversees St Martin’s, the complex is “neither fit for purpose nor financially viable”.</p>
      <p>But people who live in the vicinity say that the building was a highly valued “lively community centre” and see the proposed redevelopment of the site as a big loss.</p>
      <p>They are now gearing up to galvanise residents to object to the application.</p>
      <p>Resident Dominic Swarbrick said: “I know it belongs to the church but it is a community asset, everybody uses it. We are up in arms about it.”</p>
      <p>After the building was shut on September 30, Broughton and Fulwood Guides, Brownies and Rainbows which met in a building at the complex have relocated to Broughton and members of St John Baptist Church Bowling Club joined other clubs in the area.</p>
      <p>A social club which also used the hub has stopped.</p>
      <p>According to plans “all existing groups who previously used the Parish Hall can be accommodated within the new building” - apart from the Guides, Bowling Club and social group.</p>
