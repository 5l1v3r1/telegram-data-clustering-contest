      <p>The Supreme Court on Monday said it will pass its order at 10.30 am on Tuesday on the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress combine's plea against the Maharashtra governor's decision to swear in Devendra Fadnavis as chief minister.</p>
      <p>A bench comprising Justices N V Ramana, Ashok Bhushan and Sanjiv Khanna is likely to pass an order on holding of a floor test.</p>
      <p>The combine was pressing that the floor test is ordered today itself which was opposed by Fadnavis and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar.</p>
