      <h1>Final Destination? Watch out for this Thai truck’s load of swinging death sticks (Video)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:00:25+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bangkok" target="_blank">Coconuts Bangkok</a></address>
      <p>Being impaled by the pointy ends of long, sharp poles is not a hazard you want to add to an already tricky mountain road, but one driver’s video of such an encounter is terrifying other motorists online today.</p>
      <p>Failing to buckle up or skipping the motorbike helmet are dangerous road behaviors, sure, but hardly anything unusual. And everyone in Thailand at some point has seen a truck carrying a load completely beyond its rated capacity. But it was a video of the truck carrying a ill-fitting and poorly secured load that has many reaching for the panic button.</p>
      <p>“Not only have I seen Final Destination, I’ve seen news of sharp objects stabbing people like this. I was kind of freaked the hell out, so I decided to overtake the asshole, hahaha,” Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/Psolemn">@Psolemn</a> wrote in a tweet of the first video of the incident last night.</p>
      <p>The motorist said it was during a drive up to Mon Cham, a busy mountaintop tourist destination with panoramic views in Chiang Mai’s Mae Rim District, that the truck was encountered.</p>
      <p>In the video, it is seen slowly trundling up the mountain with hundreds of long bamboo shafts stretching way past its bed. Every time it turns, the bamboo – which juts out threateningly to the peril of passing vehicles –  looks ready to fall out at any moment.</p>
      <p>As to the truck’s final destination, that was unclear as <a href="https://twitter.com/Psolemn">@Psolemn</a> ran into it again on the way back down. The truck – still carrying the bamboo loads – made the Twitter user’s “heart drop” once again.</p>

      <p>“Every time the car turns, I get scared and have to leave it room… When it turns, it can easily smack someone, because the bamboo sticks poking out are so long,” a voice can be heard describing the situation.</p>
      <p>As of early Monday afternoon, the two videos had been watched more than 23,000 times.</p>
