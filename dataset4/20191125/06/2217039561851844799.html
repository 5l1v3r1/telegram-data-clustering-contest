        <b>BERLIN Temasek, the biggest shareholder in Austria's AMS, backs the sensor-maker's planned US$5 billion (S$6.8 billion) takeover of German lighting group Osram, the fund's managing director told a magazine on Saturday.</b>

      <p>"We think the coming together of AMS with Osram is sensible, especially in the field of optoelectronics," Tema- sek's Uwe Krueger was quoted as saying by German weekly Euro am Sonntag.</p>
      <p>However, he added that he would not get involved in business decisions, a stance he had also made clear to the IG Metall union, which had asked Temasek to speak out against the plans.</p>
      <p>AMS' bid to create a global leader in sensors and lights stumbled last month when it fell short of the necessary shareholder backing.</p>
      <p>Since then AMS has offered to protect jobs in Germany and lowered the acceptance threshold to try to get the deal over the line.</p>
      <p>Osram shareholders have until Dec 5 to accept the offer.</p>
      <p>Dr Krueger also told Euro am Sonntag magazine that he stood by Temasek's investment in German chemicals giant Bayer, even though litigation over glyphosate-based weed-killer, which tens of thousands of plaintiffs blame for cancer, will drag on.</p>
      <p>"But that does not change anything in terms of the basic strategy. We remain convinced by Bayer's operating business," he added.</p>
      <p>Bayer, which said last month the number of US plaintiffs had more than doubled since July, argues that regulators and extensive research have found glyphosate to be safe. - REUTERS</p>
