      <h1>Ambulance 'turnaround' times see huge rise as only 15.9% meet guidelines</h1>
      <h2>Turnaround times deemed to be safe are being regularly missed throughout the country</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Liz Farsaci</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/hospitals">Hospitals</a> have seen a huge rise in the time it takes <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ambulance-services">ambulance</a> crews to prepare for new emergencies – with only 15.9% of cases meeting guidelines.</p>
      <p>Turnaround times deemed to be safe by the Health Information and Quality Authority (<a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/hiqa">HIQA</a>) are being regularly missed throughout the country.</p>
      <p>They measure how long it takes from an ambulance arriving at a hospital to when the crew is ready to accept another call.</p>
      <p>The figures were released to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fianna-fail">Fianna Fail</a> health spokesman <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/stephen-donnelly">Stephen Donnelly</a> who described them as “shocking”.</p>
      <p>The HIQA reported 95% of patients should be handed over from an ambulance crew to emergency department staff in less than 20 minutes. This differs from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/hse">HSE</a> guidelines, which state 30 minutes as the target time.</p>

      <p>The 20-minute target was only met in 15.9% of cases in September.</p>
      <p>The HSE 30-minute guideline was achieved 37.1% of the time.</p>
      <p>Both sets of figures have dropped dramatically since September 2017, when they stood at 25.2% and 53.2% respectively.</p>
      <p>For Kerry University Hospital, there is a turnaround of less than 20 minutes in just 1.7% of cases.</p>
      <p>Mayo General, University Hospital Galway and South Tipperary all came in below the 5% mark.</p>

      <p>Deputy Donnelly said: “The decline in the transfer turnaround times is yet another reflection of the pressures on hospitals and the lack of capacity.</p>
      <p>“The main reason for the delay is because emergency departments are too busy with too few staff to process a patient coming in by ambulance.”</p>
      <p>The Coombe Maternity Hospital and the National Maternity Hospital met the 20-minute turnaround times in 57.7% and 42.1% of cases respectively.</p>
      <p>The figure for Temple Street Children’s Hospital was 60.9%.</p>
