        <b>Adelani Adepegba, Abuja</b>
      </p>
      <p>The outgoing Catholic Bishop of Abuja, Cardinal John Onaiyekan, has urged Nigerians to look forward to a glorious future despite the failure of political leaders to make a difference.</p>
      <p>Speaking with journalists after he led a procession of parishioners of Our Lady Queen of Nigeria, Pro-Cathedral Garki, Abuja, on Sunday, he expressed the hope that the country would become great.</p>
      <p>He said, “When I see the sample of the governor in my state who is supposed to be the youngest among the governors, I’ve not seen anything in him that shows that we have something new coming, but we cannot lose hope.</p>
      <p>“I will soon leave this world and I hope by the time I leave this world, we will begin to see a bit of light at the end of the tunnel. We cannot deceive ourselves.</p>
      <p>“We started at independence with great hopes for this country, but they were dashed and when we thought we’ve finished with military rule, another soldier came and drove away the civilians.</p>
      <p>He added, “And the irony of it is that that same man is still ruling us today. It’s an irony I would say because it is a complete total disgrace for the nation. We cannot move, simply repeating the same thing and hoping that we will succeed.”</p>
      <p>The cleric sought prayers for his successor, Bishop Ignatius Kaigama, who would be inaugurated on December 5.</p>
