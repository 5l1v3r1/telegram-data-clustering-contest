      <h2>Arsenal legend Paul Merson raises questions about Jose Mourinho's appointment at Spurs</h2>

      <h3>Paul Merson has accused Tottenham Hotspur of panicking after their appointment of Jose Mourinho as their new manager.</h3>
      <p>Spurs turned to Mourinho after the north London outfit parted company with Mauricio Pochettino last week following five seasons in charge.</p>
      <p>Mourinho returned to Premier League management almost 11 months after the Portuguese head coach was sacked by Manchester United.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old has previously managed Chelsea FC and Manchester United as Spurs become Mourinho’s third Premier League club.</p>
      <p>His reputation has been damaged by a largely negative two-and-a-half year spell in charge of Manchester United despite winning the Europa League and the League Cup.</p>
      <p>Mourinho made a victorious start to his Tottenham reign on Saturday after Spurs were 3-2 winners against West Ham at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>But former Arsenal midfielder Merson believes Tottenham have made a mistake turning to Mourinho to replace Pochettino at the north London club.</p>
      <p>“Jose Mourinho was the best of the best when talking about top managers. But WAS is a very big word when we are talking about the Special One now,” Merson wrote in the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/paul-merson-column-jose-mourinho-20938245">Daily Star</a>.</p>
      <p>“Football has changed since he was flying high in his glory days with Porto, Chelsea and Inter Milan. Back then you could win games 1-0 and nobody would really care.</p>
      <p>“Keep it tight and get the three points was all that mattered. But now there is huge pressure to score goals.</p>
      <p>“While you also have the talent around in the Premier League now that makes it even harder to keep clean sheets.</p>
      <p>“There is no doubt he is still a very good manager. But I still cannot believe that he is the new Tottenham boss.</p>
      <p>“I cannot see the plan behind this, it is simply a quick fix. Spurs have panicked because they are worried they won’t qualify for the Champions League next season.”</p>
      <p>Spurs are in ninth position in the Premier League table and nine points adrift of the top four.</p>
      <p>Tottenham finished in the top four in their last four seasons under Pochettino, something which the club hadn’t achieved previously.</p>
      <p>Spurs lost 2-0 to Liverpool FC in the Champions League final in Madrid last term after Tottenham beat Borussia Dortmund, Manchester City and Ajax in the knockout stages.</p>
