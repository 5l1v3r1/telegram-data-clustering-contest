      <h1>Knicks’ embattled Kevin Knox gets surprise vote of confidence</h1>

      <p>Kevin Knox went from getting benched to getting a vote of confidence from Knicks coach David Fizdale in less than 24 hours.</p>
      <p>The second-year wing had been buried in the rotation of late, getting benched for the second half of back-to-back games before being a surprise addition to the starting lineup Sunday night. RJ Barrett was scratched nearly 90 minutes before tipoff against the Nets because of an illness, so Fizdale called on Knox to make his first start of the year.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to give Kevin a vote of confidence, and I really thought he played some good basketball tonight,” Fizdale said after the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/nets-hold-off-knicks-in-dramatic-closing-moments/">Knicks fell to the Nets 103-101</a> at the Garden. “I thought he competed well on the defensive end and his minutes were quality minutes.”</p>
      <p>Knox still struggled to get on the floor late in the game, playing just 3:59 in the third quarter and none in the fourth. He finished with five points, shooting 1-for-4 from the floor, to go with three assists and three rebounds in 17:40.</p>

      <p>“You gotta be ready when your name gets called,” said Knox, who had been challenged by Fizdale recently to improve his defense. “Unfortunately my boy RJ is a little sick. Just want to be able to bring the same energy he brings and hopefully get him back soon.”</p>
      <p>Barrett went through the Knicks’ walkthrough before the game before getting sent home. The rookie will try to get healthy in time for his homecoming Wednesday in Toronto against the Raptors.</p>

      <p>The last time the Knicks played the Nets, Frank Ntilikina couldn’t even get off the bench.</p>
      <p>By their second meeting of the season Sunday — just under a month later — the point guard was starting his 12th straight game and had a chance to blow the roof off the Garden in the final minute of the fourth quarter. As the Knicks made their comeback, Ntilikina got a good look at an open 3 from the corner that could have tied the game at 100, but it wouldn’t go down.</p>
      <p>“I gotta go back in the gym and be ready to take that next shot the next time,” said Ntilikina, who finished with eight points (on 3-for-11 shooting), five assists and three rebounds.</p>
      <p>Fizdale said before the game he was encouraging Ntilikina to keep shooting, even when his shots are not falling. The 21-year-old has come into his own since taking over as the starter and has brought with him a different mentality with the support from Fizdale.</p>
      <p>“It’s definitely easier to take these shots and not refuse them,” Ntilikina said. “It’s the right play and I have confidence in my abilities. If I miss, I’ll just be ready for the next one because I know I can make these shots.”</p>

      <p>Dennis Smith Jr. chipped in 10 points and five rebounds in 20 minutes off the bench. … Wayne Ellington (12 points) scored in double digits for the second straight game.</p>
