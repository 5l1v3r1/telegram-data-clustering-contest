      <p>A murder investigation is underway after a 22 year-old man was shot dead in Dublin yesterday evening.</p>
      <p>The victim was shot in the chest several times was taken to Beaumont Hospital where he was later pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>He was in his front garden when it is believed at least two gunmen shot him shortly after 5pm.</p>
      <p>Gardaí believe last night's shooting in Dublin was related to the ongoing gang feud in Coolock. and are appealing for witnesses to come forward.</p>
      <p>They are also appealing to anyone with camera footage from the vicinity of Clonshaugh Avenue between 4.30pm and 5.30pm today to make it available to investigators.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is asked to contact Coolock Garda Station 01-6664200 or the Garda Confidential Line 1800 666 111.</p>
      <p>Local councillor Racheal Batten said that children in Coolock are becoming too familiar with the sound of gunshots.</p>
      <p>"It's become a stage where now children are familiar the sound of gunshots, and that's not acceptable in any society.</p>
      <p>"We've got children going to school this morning passing gardaí and gardaí tape and there's asking what's happened and it's not a position that any young child should be in."</p>
      <p>The Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said he was "deeply concerned" to hear of the shooting.</p>
      <p>He said: "I condemn this wanton violence. I urge anyone with information to please contact An Garda Siochana and assist them with their investigation."</p>
      <p><b>Update - 10.47am:</b> Independent councillor John Lyons has warned that years of underinvestment in the Coolock area has led to the growing drug and crime problems which culminated in the death of a 22 year old man at the weekend.</p>
      <p>“People are hugely concerned that a brutal murder happened in a residential area,” he told RTÉ radio’s Today with Séan O’Rourke show.</p>
      <p>He pointed out that the public fears the gangland feud is escalating and that recently the home of an innocent family was fired at in a case of mistaken identity.</p>
      <p>“People feel it is not safe, even for those not involved in the drug trade.”</p>
      <p>Cllr Lyons said that while resources are being made available for the gardaí, “they are playing catch up”.</p>
      <p>Open drug dealing is going on in the area and “people’s lives are being destroyed” he warned.</p>
      <p>It was alarming to see taxies coming into and out of the area for people buying drugs. “That’s been allowed to develop.</p>
      <p>“We’ve seen some improvement, but more needs to be done. We need greater commitment from the Government, to multiply resources. What is needed is a multi pronged approach.”</p>
      <p>He said that gardaí in Coolock are very involved with community initiatives in an effort to keep teens from being attracted to “a life of crime and death.”</p>
