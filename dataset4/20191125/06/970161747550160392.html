      <p>The Prince of Wales has conducted a speech in pidgin to hundreds of school pupils and other guests during the last day of his Royal tour.</p>
      <p>Charles arrived at the Lawson Tama in Honiara to applause and was presented with a chupu – a traditional offering which included a live pig tied up.</p>
      <p>His speech was greeted with laughter and applause as it became clear he would continue speaking in pidgin English throughout.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Queen blong yumi and Duke blong Edinburgh telling me such a good memories blong time algeter visitin this islands.</p>

      <p>Charles also spoke about environmental issues in his speech, saying: ‘Sorry tumas how environment blong yufala al se everywhere lo world had threatened by climate change, global warming, pollution, unsustainable logging, over-fishing.’</p>
      <p>He also underlined the importance of preserving natural environments for future generations, saying: ‘Suppose yufala keep im good algether natural heritage blong yufala, by algether piccinni and grandpiccinni blong you, fella se benefit lo hem.’</p>
      <p>The last day of the tour also saw Charles address the Solomon Islands parliament, where he spoke of the need to address violence against women and girls.</p>
      <p>Calling gender-based violence an ‘appalling scourge’, the prince told MPs: ‘In the Solomon Islands, as elsewhere, as long as women face the despicable threat of physical and sexual violence, or discrimination on the basis of their gender, your economy and your society will simply never be able to achieve their full and extraordinary potential.’</p>

      <p>A 2009 study carried out by the Pacific Community suggested that nearly two in three women aged 15-49 has suffered physical and/or sexual violence from their partner at least once in their lifetime, and 42% in the last 12 months.</p>
      <p>Charles’s last day in the Solomon Islands also saw him skip lunch in favour of meeting guests at a reception in a Honiara hotel and visiting the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency, an organisation which works to control tuna fishing and keep it sustainable.</p>

      <p>The prince’s motorcade was given a guard of honour by schoolchildren as it rolled into Honiara airport.</p>
      <p>There, he inspected a police guard on the tarmac, and the force band went on to play God Save the Queen and God Save Our Solomon Islands.</p>
      <p>Charles then boarded the Bombardier plane for his return to the UK.</p>
