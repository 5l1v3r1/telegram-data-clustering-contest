      <p>This time of year is my absolute favourite. As a proud summer-disliker, the chilly winds are no worry to me, and I live for cosy nights in with blankets, soft socks, and hot beverages. It also starts to feel really Christmassy around now, and you inevitably look to the new year ahead. With this comes a need to buy a brand new paper diary. I've never been about the digi planners, and have always keep my organisation skills proudly analog. With that in mind, I have found 7 of <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/9-best-beauty-advent-calendars-in-the-uk-for-christmas-2019-18789590">the best 2020 diaries</a> for peak organisation.</p>
      <p>There are certain brands that just always nail their diary designs and who I usually turn to. The past couple of years I've opted for a design by Papier. Papier offers a wide range of different styles, all of which can be personalised and range in colour and design. Other brands that do them well are the Rifle Paper Co. (who I turned to for my 2017 diary), Ban.Do, Kikki-K, and Typo. Along with the traditional cool stationary brands, there's also stores like Liberty, whose own-brand diaries are the most sophisticated of the bunch, and are totally worth paying a little extra for.</p>
      <p>Keep reading to check out my top 7 for 2020 so you can start getting your life planned out already.</p>
