      <h1>Robby Anderson’s persistence pays off in big way for Jets</h1>

      <p>Robby Anderson climbed into the stands and looked out into MetLife Stadium on Sunday afternoon, outstretching his arms after scoring the Jets’ third touchdown of the day.</p>
      <p>Fans screaming in his face and patting him on the head, Anderson had just given the Jets a 27-3 lead over the Raiders.</p>
      <p>Anderson finished with four catches on five targets for a game-high 86 yards and the touchdown <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/jets-completely-dominate-raiders-for-third-straight-win/">in the Jets’ 34-3 blowout.</a> He averaged 21.5 yards per reception and gave Oakland’s defense fits.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old receiver was coming off quiet games against the Giants and the Redskins, when he combined for two receptions for 17 yards in back-to-back wins.</p>
      <p>“Before, it wasn’t really anything he was doing,” coach Adam Gase said. “He was doing a good job of getting open. For whatever reason — we couldn’t get the throw to him or the read took [Sam Darnold] somewhere else first — I just think it worked out right for him today.</p>
      <p>“He really has been doing a good job of staying with it. Today, it finally paid off.”</p>

      <p>On a third down early in the second quarter at Oakland’s 43, Darnold ignored the wide-open space in front of him when he could have run for a first down and connected with Anderson in the middle of the field for a 31-yard gain, setting up a 35-yard Sam Ficken field goal to give the Jets a 13-3 lead.</p>
      <p>Anderson said that the biggest difference between the Jets’ 1-7 start and the last three games has been the team’s accountability for each individual job. Anderson’s chemistry with Darnold has grown, even if the results were limited before Sunday.</p>
      <p>“I practice with him week in and week out, and I know what he can do,” Demaryius Thomas said of Anderson. “It’s just about taking advantage of his opportunities. He can run the whole route tree, he can flat-out fly and he’s a good teammates I’m happy for him.’’</p>
      <p>With Sunday’s performance, Anderson now has 445 yards and three touchdowns.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s good momentum,” Anderson said. “Regardless of who it’s against, we need to win. But, you know, it feels good to come out and put up a win like that against a very good team like that.”</p>
