      <p>Former Minister of Youth and Sports, Elvis Afriyie Ankrah has admitted that he could not lead investigations into the infamous Ghana Youth Employment Entrepreneurship Development Agency (GYEEDA) scandal which involved the wrongful payment of huge sums of monies to persons and companies because he was in a conflict situation.</p>
      <p>He disclosed that as Sports Minister, he was in a conflict of interest situation because he had been tasked to investigate persons who had given him financial support in the electioneering campaign</p>
      <p>“I am talking from experience. I was the one who was made to investigate GYEEDA, I was in conflict because the people involved were the people who gave me money.  People don’t like the truth. That’s why we are deceived. We must tell the truth,” he thundered at the event.</p>
      <p>The National Democratic Congress (NDC) Director of Elections, Elvis Afriyie Ankrah explained that corruption in government is fueled by sponsors and financiers of politicians who expect to get their monies back by any means necessary.</p>
      <p>The former Sports Minister decried people’s dislike for the truth which leads to deception in politics, admonishing all and sundry to be truthful.</p>
      <p>“So for those people, they are not NGOs so when they put in the money, they definitely want a payback,” he said at a public event recently in a video sighted by <a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/">MyNewsGh.com</a></p>
      <p>It would be recalled that the GYEEDA scandal involved the wrongful payment of huge sums of monies to persons and companies who had purported to have provided services to the agency which was under the Youth and Sports Ministry.</p>
      <p>The scandal  eventually  led to the jailing  of a former National Coordinator of the defunct Ghana Youth Employment and Entrepreneurial Development Agency (GYEEDA), Abuga Pele, and a businessman, Philip Akpeena Assibit to a total of 18 years in prison for their involvement in the GH¢4.1 million GYEEDA scandal.</p>
