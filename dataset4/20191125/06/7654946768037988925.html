      <h1>Josh Roberts is big St. John’s surprise: ‘Oozing with potential’</h1>

      <p>UNCASVILLE, Conn. — Ian Steere was supposed to be the big-man addition that could erase some of St. John’s problems in the paint.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/24/st-johns-adding-ex-n-c-state-player-in-latest-transfer/">N.C. State transfer, eligible in mid-December</a>, may provide plenty of production when he joins the team on the floor. But when the skilled 6-foot-9 forward does come back, it will be as a complement to the Johnnies’ biggest surprise through seven games.</p>
      <p>Josh Roberts, rarely used a year ago, continued to be a revelation on Sunday, delivering the best game of his college career in a much-needed, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/bench-rallies-st-johns-to-significant-early-season-win/">come-from-behind 78-63 victory over UMass</a> at Mohegan Sun Arena.</p>
      <p>The lanky 6-foot-9 sophomore forward scored a career-high 16 points, grabbed eight rebounds and blocked three shots, continuing his unexpectedly rapid development.</p>
      <p>“He’s oozing with potential,” coach Mike Anderson said.</p>
      <p>A three-star recruit from Alabama, Roberts was a late bloomer when it came to basketball. Football was his sport of choice. He was raw last year, appearing in just 18 games and averaging 6.2 minutes when he did see the floor. He admitted spending so much time on the bench discouraged him.</p>
      <p>But Roberts spent the offseason working to not let that happen, adding significant muscle to his slim frame to avoid getting pushed around. During the preseason, teammates talked up his progress. It quickly became clear it was more than just talk, Roberts producing nine points, seven rebounds and four blocks in the opener against Mercer. He’s only improved since then. It’s not a coincidence the two games he got in foul trouble St. John’s lost.</p>

      <p>“I’m having a lot of fun, man,” Roberts said. “I don’t take it for granted, but it’s fun being out there, being able to play the minutes that I’m playing and helping my team [by] doing what I need to do.”</p>
      <p>When Roberts played last year, he was unsure of himself, often in the wrong position. Now he looks in command, crediting the coaching staff with having him prepared for every situation. He makes quick decisions with the ball. If he’s close enough to the hoop, Roberts will look to make a move. Otherwise, he searches for a teammate.</p>
      <p>“I think he’s stayed within the confines of what he can do right now,” Anderson said.</p>
      <p>Roberts’ most valuable assets are his rim protection and finishing ability. He’s frequently the last line of defense for St. John’s, making up for teammates when they get beat. He’s already had a number of thunderous put-back dunks, making opponents pay for double-teaming stars LJ Figueroa and Mustapha Heron.</p>
      <p>After his stellar performance, Roberts was asked what he prefers, a big follow dunk or an emphatic rejection. He paused, looking over to Anderson.</p>
      <p>“You’re going to say offense, I know it,” Anderson said. “Go ahead, say it.”</p>
      <p>“Probably a put-back,” Roberts said. “It gives me a lot of energy and I just feed off of that and I play defense better.”</p>
      <p>“Good answer,” his coach said.</p>
      <p>He’s doing almost everything right so far.</p>
