      <p>Survivor Series featured NXT, RAW and SmackDown engage in a war to establish brand superiority. With the Black-and-Gold brand already leading, the men's traditional tag team elimination match played a vital role in determining which show will get the ultimate upper hand.</p>
      <p>Towards the end of the match, NXT's Keith Lee pinned the Red brand's Seth Rollins leaving him and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/roman-reigns">Roman Reigns</a> as the last men standing. Eventually, The Big Dog would pick up the win after having a back-and-forth altercation with the NXT Superstar. Post-match, Reigns and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/keith-lee">Keith Lee</a> both appreciated the efforts put in by one another, which left the fans yearning for one more match between the two.</p>
      <h3>Roman Reigns' comment</h3>
      <p>After WWE Survivor Series 2019 went off-air, Roman Reigns took to Twitter to comment on SmackDown's victory in that match and yet again, acknowledged the performance of Keith Lee.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>Well, damn. That was fun, Chicago. Respect to #Raw and #WWENXT @RealKeithLee, Iâ€™ll see you again big man. #SurvivorSeries</i>
      </blockquote>

      <p>WWE COO <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/triple-h">Triple H</a> was also full of praises for the NXT Superstar as he had put up a valiant effort to guide the NXT team to victory.</p>

      <p>As evident from their Survivor Series confrontation, Roman Reigns and Keith Lee will steal the show if they collide in the ring in singles action and we hope this dream match becomes a reality pretty soon.</p>
