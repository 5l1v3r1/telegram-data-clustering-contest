      <h2>The appeal has been backed by Sir David Attenborough</h2>

      <p>An<b><i> '</i></b>urgent' appeal has been launched to secure the long-term future of Attenborough Nature Reserve after the landowner announced plans to sell the site.</p>
      <p>World renowned natural history broadcaster <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/david-attenborough">Sir David Attenborough</a> is backing Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust's bid to buy the reserve.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/charities">charity</a> has described it as a "once in a lifetime opportunity" after helping to maintain the site alongside the landowners for the last 60 years.</p>
      <p>Situated in the village of Attenborough, on the banks of the River Trent, the land was used for sand and gravel extraction from the 1920s until 2017.</p>
      <p>Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust has now agreed to buy the land from building materials company Cemex UK.</p>
      <p>The Trust has launched a £1m 'Attenborough Nature Reserve Lifeline Appeal' to raise enough cash by the end of January, 2020 to buy and maintain the land.</p>
      <p>Chief executive of Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust, Paul Wilkinson said: “We’re so excited to finally have the opportunity to secure the long term future of this remarkable nature reserve.  </p>
      <p>"Attenborough Nature Reserve is part of the Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust’s DNA.</p>
      <p>"It’s the site that provided the spark for our formation and for all we’ve achieved across the county in the past six decades, and we need people to help us ensure that the reserve can be forever safe in our hands.”</p>

      <p>While not actually being named after him, Sir David Attenborough, president emeritus of The Wildlife Trusts, has a long-standing connection with the reserve stretching back to 1966 when he was invited to officially open it.</p>
      <p>It transpired that Sir David's family's name originated from the village, and his grandfather and parents were all born nearby.</p>
      <p>Sir David returned in 1988 for the part of the Trust's Silver Jubilee and again in 2005 to open the Attenborough Nature Centre.</p>
      <p>Speaking in support of the appeal, Sir David said: “Attenborough Nature Reserve is a symbol of hope in a challenging world.</p>
      <p>"It is a natural oasis on the edge of a big city, full of remarkable and beautiful birds and other wildlife.</p>
      <p>"Please give as generously as you can to help us make sure this place is forever safe in the hands of Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust.”</p>

      <p>Wildlife recording at Attenborough began in 1948 as many of the extraction lagoons had been attracting birds and other wildlife.</p>
      <p>Then in the 1960s, a fledgling Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust fought alongside local residents to prevent the lagoons being filled with ash from the new Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station.</p>
      <p>With permission from the then owners, Trent Gravels Ltd, in 1966 the reserve was created.</p>
      <p>Now, more than 500,000 people visit the reserve every year which has been noted as one of the best sites in the UK to see the kingfisher.</p>
      <p>As well as rare wildlife such as otters and bitterns, it is home to more than 450 plant species, 400 moth species, 160 bird species and 100 species of hoverfly.</p>

      <p>Visitors at Attenborough Nature Reserve shared how special the site is to their families.</p>
      <p>Luke Barton, 40, of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/long-eaton">Long Eaton</a>, was with his partner Jessica Horsman, 29, and daughter Georgia Horsman, aged three.</p>
      <p>He said: "Whenever we come here and I put pictures on social media people always comment saying how beautiful it looks and asking where we are and it's just on our doorstep.</p>
      <p>"When my first daughter was born we were here taking pictures of her at the reserve so this is a really special place for us as a family and I think a lot of other families would say the same."</p>
      <p>Oli Heathcote, 39, of Attenborough, was visiting the reserve with his wife Helen, 36, and son Alex, aged four. He said: "For us the reserve has been a God-send recently because our dog is only a year old so he always needs a walk and you couldn't ask for a nicer place to do that.</p>
      <p>"We've lived in the village of Attenborough for around ten years and we're so lucky to have such a beautiful selection of wildlife on our doorstep.</p>
      <p>"It's a great way to get children out as well and our son Alex loves going in puddles, climbing and especially eating the cake in the cafe."</p>
      <p>Anyone who wants to donate the Attenborough Nature Reserve Lifeline Appeal can do so online at <a href="https://www.nottinghamshirewildlife.org/lifelineappeal">www.nottinghamshirewildlife.org/LifelineAppeal</a> or in person at Attenborough Nature Centre.</p>
