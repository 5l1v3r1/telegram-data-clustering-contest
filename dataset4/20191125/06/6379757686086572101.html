      <p>Speaking at State House in Chamwino, Dodoma Region yesterday during a ceremony where he received dividend cheques from some parastatals   and other companies where the government holds shares, the Head of State said out of 266 companies the government has invested in, only 79 paid dividends for the financial year 2018/19.</p>
      <p>The government has invested a total of 56trn/- in the companies which must remit returns to government or their leaders leave office, he said.</p>
      <p>“When the 60 days elapse, the board of directors of companies that will not have paid dividend will have to dissolve themselves by writing a letter. For the boards that I appoint, they will cease to exist that day and those appointed by other authorities will be dissolved,” he said. </p>
      <p>The President said that it is unacceptable that parastatals with boards and chief executive officers and a host of experts who are paid handsomely operate on losses.</p>
      <p>He said after the two months, no heads of loss-making parastatals will keep their jobs.</p>
      <p>“It’s unacceptable to continue having such parastatals. It’s unacceptable to continue keeping leaders of that type. It’s unacceptable to continue with boards of directors that do not want to change,” he said.</p>
      <p>President Magufuli directed Finance and Planning Minister Dr Philip Mpango to write to heads of the 187 loss-making entities, informing them if they don’t write dividend cheques within 60 days, they will be jobless.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the president showered the 79 entities that paid dividends totaling 1.05trn/-, encouraging them to keep up the good job that brings profits.</p>
      <p>He also praised Treasury Registrar Athuman Mbutuka for overseeing the performance of government-owned companies and reclaiming government assets that were being held by private individuals.</p>
      <p>“We would rather have few parastatals that perform than having a lot of them that do nothing,” he said.</p>
      <p>The president also challenged the minister to embrace meritocracy while nominating people for appointment by selecting hardworking individuals instead of those they went to school with.</p>
      <p>Citing an example, he said despite that the chairman of the board of directors of the Tanzania National Electric Supply Co. Ltd (TANESCO) Dr Alexander Kyaruzi was a hard worker the minister in charge of the firm did not recommend him for reappointment.</p>
      <p>“I went through the names submitted to me but I didn’t see your name Dr Kyaruzi. I put it myself and you have already received your letter of reappointment,” he said.</p>
      <p>For his part, the Minister for Finance and Planning Dr Philip Mpango said revenue collections obtained from dividends and contributions of public entities have risen from 162bn/- in the year 2014/15 to 1.05trilion in fiscal 2018/19.</p>
      <p>He said that in the year 2018/19 revenue collections passing in the Treasury Registrar account reached 683.23bn/- (114.3 percent of estimates), surpassing the set goal of collecting 597.7bn/-. The collections are from the Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA), Tanzania Airports Authority (TAA), Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) and Tanzania Gaming Board (TGB).</p>
      <p>“All these achievements are the result of good supervision of public resources which include increase of institutions that provide dividends and contributions. Close supervision of policy issues on the public entities also sounds as among reasons for these achievements,” he said.</p>
      <p>Dr Mpango commended ministers for various sectors for their great support as well as the Treasury Registrar’s office for coordinating and supervising well its duties.</p>
      <p>“I also commend the Parliamentary Committee on Public Investments for its support and advice which has been helping in strengthening supervision of public institutions,” he added.</p>
