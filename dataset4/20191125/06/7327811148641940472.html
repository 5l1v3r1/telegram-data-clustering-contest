      <p>KLEIN, Texas -- The Klein Fire Dept. and the Harris County Precinct 4 Constable's Office welcomed their newest member on Sunday, a very special young man in the fight of his life.</p>
      <p>Ezra Menke was sworn-in as an honorary deputy constable and made an honorary firefighter at a surprise event on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Ezra's mother, Heather Menke, was overwhelmed by the support from first responders, friends, and medical staff that came out to the event.</p>
      <p>"This is unbelievable. First of all, I'm having a hard time not crying," Menke said. "This is huge for us because of everything Ezra's gone through."</p>
      <p>Ezra suffers from Gould Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder known to exist in only 200 people in the world, according to his mother. Ezra also has epilepsy, autism, and hemiplegia.</p>
      <p>Ezra's scheduled to undergo brain surgery in December, his fourth in an attempt to stop seizures from happening.</p>
