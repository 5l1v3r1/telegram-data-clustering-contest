        <b>Arsenal have regressed under manager Unai Emery, said former England striker Alan Shearer after the Gunners needed a stoppage-time goal from Alexandre Lacazette to earn a 2-2 draw with Southampton yesterday morning (Singapore time).</b>
      </p>
      <p>The visitors twice led with goals from Danny Ings and James Ward-Prowse, but Lacazette's brace, including his 96th-minute winner, denied Southampton a first win at Arsenal since 1987.</p>
      <p>Emery admitted that he understands supporters' frustrations, but BBC's Match of the Day pundit Shearer does not think the under-pressure Spaniard, whom fans booed off the pitch, will last much longer at the helm.</p>
      <p>Shearer said: "I don't see him getting out of it because I don't see Arsenal improving. They're getting worse.</p>
      <p>"These are mistakes that are happening every single week from trying to play out from the back. Arsenal are not good enough to do so. They keep giving chances away.</p>
      <h3>BOOS DESERVED</h3>
      <p>"I'm just seeing the same every single week, Arsenal are terrible defensively, they're getting worse!"</p>
      <p>Former Arsenal defender Tony Adams also hit out at the Gunners' defence which allowed the Saints, who are second from bottom, to register 21 shots.</p>
      <p>"The boos are deserved. It was a terrible, terrible performance, very disjointed, no defending in sight, changed his system three times - Emery's not doing himself any favours," Adams told BT Sport.</p>
      <p>"I don't want any coach losing his job, but the club are not going forward, they are not progressing... There's no one going out there to keep clean sheets.</p>
      <p>"When you're giving the opposition team at the Emirates 20 chances on your goal, you're never going to keep clean sheets."</p>
      <p>Going into the Saints' game, Arsenal have won just two of their last 10 league games, but Emery had been told by the club hierarchy before kick-off that his job was not in immediate danger so long as results improved.</p>
      <p>"We are disappointed and frustrated," Emery said.</p>
      <p>"I understand the supporters... They helped us for 90 minutes, but we didn't achieve the win to connect with them."</p>
      <p>Asked whether he feared the club's backing would be withdrawn soon, Emery replied: "They are supporting me and also I have a responsibility, I know I can do better and I'm going to try to do so."</p>
