      <p>MORGANTOWN, W.Va. — OSU quarterback Spencer Sanders’ thumb surgery was successful last Monday, and coach Mike Gundy says it’s possible the redshirt freshman could return in time to play in a bowl game at the end of December.</p>
      <p>Gundy compared Sanders’ surgery to what New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees had earlier this season to repair the UCL in the thumb on his throwing hand. Brees missed five games.</p>
      <p>But Gundy admitted that was about as detailed as he could get on Sanders’ operation.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what it’s called but I think there’s a ligament or something in there,” Gundy said. “I made a C in biology. Did better in kinesiology.</p>
      <p>“He’s a competitive little guy. He’s like the Tasmanian Devil, you know, he just keeps rolling all the time. And finally, the doctors made him come out.”</p>
      <p>Gundy did not specify whether he would play Sanders in a bowl game, even if the first-year starter was healthy in time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cowboys play it safe with Brown in QB run game</b>
      </p>
      <p>Oklahoma State quarterback Dru Brown’s primary job on Saturday was getting rid of the ball, either to Chuba Hubbard or a receiver.</p>
      <p>Though he has shown the ability to run throughout his career, Brown carried the ball on his own just four times Saturday — much fewer than Spencer Sanders had been running before his injury — to go with three sacks.</p>
      <p>Gundy and offensive coordinator Sean Gleeson mostly stayed away from the quarterback run game.</p>
      <p>Was it because Brown isn’t the dynamic runner Sanders is, or because of the Cowboys’ quarterback situation, Brown needed to be protected?</p>
      <p>“Both,” Gundy said. “I started calling for (quarterback runs) in the second half and Sean ran some of it.</p>
      <p>“We started doing some of it in the third quarter and early fourth quarter and it helped us a little bit. When you’re in a position we are, we gotta protect our guys best we can. But we also have to do what we can do to win.”</p>
      <p>OSU traveled with a pair of walk-ons, redshirt freshman Shaun Taylor and true freshman Peyton Thompson, as Brown's backups Saturday.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pokes in the polls</b>
      </p>
      <p>Oklahoma State came in at No. 21 in the Associated Press poll Sunday, and moved up two spots to 21 in the coaches’ poll as well.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys will likely hold that same spot in the College Football Playoff rankings, which come out Tuesday. Nearly every team ranked ahead of OSU either won or had an open date Saturday.</p>
