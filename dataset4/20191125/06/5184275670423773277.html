      <p>It was a decent Sunday for <i>Marjaavaan</i> as <b>2.32 crores</b> came in. Overall, the weekend has been fair and though after first week it had seemed that around <b>8 crores</b> would be on the cards between Friday to Sunday, the collections have been somewhat lesser than that.</p>
      <p>Overall, the total of the Sidharth Malhotra and Riteish Deshmukh starrer stands at <b>42.92 crores.</b> From here, the Milap Zaveri directed film should manage to stretch towards the <b>50 crores</b> total. The film is a commercial success due to costs involved and the price at which it was sold. For a predominantly single screen affair, this Milap Zaveri directed film has managed to keep its head high, despite not so flattering reviews.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the film’s producers Emmay Entertainment [Nikkhil Advani, Monisha Advani, Madhu Bhojwani] are through with the shooting of their next film, Indoo Ki Jawaani. Spearheaded by Kiara Advani with Aditya Seal as the leading man, this would be yet another film belonging to an altogether different zone and genre for the production house after Batla House and Marjaavaan.</p>
