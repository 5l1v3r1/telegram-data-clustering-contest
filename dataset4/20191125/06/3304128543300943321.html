      <p>An assistant minister who worked during President Daniel Moi’s tenure has passed away at the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) after a long term illness.</p>
      <p>Tola Kofa, a former member of parliament for Galole passed on at 75 years after having been admitted at the KNH for about a week.</p>
      <p>According to his son, Patrick Mgawa, the former legislator had been ailing for a period of time before it got worse and had to be admitted for one week.</p>
      <p>Tofa served as an MP for 15 years and was the assistant minister for water between 1998 and 2002, under Moi’s tenure.</p>

      <p>In 2010, the former legislator made an astounding move by applying for a bursary to help him fund his masters degree education that he claimed he had not completed.</p>
      <p>He was among the applicants from Tana River District who sought funding from the Galole Constituency Development Fund.</p>
      <p>Apparently, he turned up for an interview with his wife and two children, and when asked why he needed funding yet he owed properties, he was unable to explain.</p>

      <p>He has been at loggerheads with several authority officials both during his time as MP and even after.</p>
      <p>An incident in 2003 for instance, a water pump valued to be Sh700,000 was found at his premises after it had been reported missing from the Ministry of Water Development.</p>
      <p>He was under fire, with the then police Chief Danson Mutun stating that it had been given to the legislator as a constituency public property but instead he opted to take it to his home.</p>
