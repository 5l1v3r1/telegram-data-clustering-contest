      <h1>Bristol Rovers finding that attack is the best form of defence after Shrewsbury Town win</h1>
      <h2>The view from the stands</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Dennis Payter</a></address>
      <p>At last we discovered that attack is the best form of defence.</p>
      <p>Speaking to some Shrews fans before the game they felt defending was their strength and they were poor going forward. It could have been <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Bristol Rovers </a>they were talking about, especially after Bromley, so we all agreed we were about to witness a boring 0-0 draw.</p>
      <p>I feared we would be parking the bus once I discovered Jonson Clarke-Harris was not in the line-up. Some were upset he had played last Tuesday but I didn’t blame Graham Coughlan for playing him - I think it is vital for the club to have a good cup run. We need the money, I can’t see us getting promotion and it is about time we did well in the FA Cup again.</p>
      <p>With just Victor Adeboyejo up front I was delighted how we took the game to the home side right from the start. Well virtually from the start. I don’t know if we practise the kick-off but the four times we restarted the game the ball went straight into touch.</p>

      <p>But never mind that, Ollie Clarke and Liam Sercombe in particular were offering tireless support to Adeboyejo up front and it was Sercombe’s brilliant corner that gave us the start we deserved. It came in at pace and just right for Tony Clark to nod in superbly at the far post. Who needed JCH?</p>
      <p>At Bromley we probably scored too early as we then spent 87 minutes defending and it did not make for good viewing on national television. But suddenly we were two up and it could have been three except for a very tight offside in a crowded goalmouth.</p>
      <p>So we had gone in just one goal in front at half-time as Town had scored from their only shot on target. We were expecting a rear-guard action after the break but no, thanks to a poor headed clearance from the home keeper, Liam Sercombe kept his cool and picked his spot from the edge of the area to put it away.</p>
      <p>The exhausted Adeboyejo then made way for Tyler Smith whose tireless running in the last 15 minutes proved invaluable.</p>
      <p>Yet in keeping with this unpredictable game our defence, which has looked so good in recent games suddenly gave two goals away and all the good work was coming undone. But then up popped Abu Ogogo - what was he doing in the home goalmouth? - to smash home the deserved winner in front of the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Bristol Rovers </a>fans.</p>
      <p>So we scored four goals away without JCH, marvellous. Now let’s take this more attacking spirit forward to next week, defeat Plymouth and get a big fish in the third round.</p>
