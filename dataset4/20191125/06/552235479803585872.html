      <h2>Glasgow Uni accents all round as Lib Dem leader Swinson looks back on the weekend's top flight action with OldFirmFacts</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Old Firm Facts</a></address>
      <p>Hoy ghuoys, Jo Swinson here!</p>
      <p>Happy Monday to you all, or as we say in Scotland, ‘Och aye just now’!</p>
      <p>I’ve taken a break from turning up on doorsteps and being asked questions like “Who are you?”, “Why?” and “Seriously, why?” to provide my take on this weekend’s Scotch Premier League action.</p>
      <p>Paisley, Kilmarnock, Glasgow, Hamilton, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Handily, that’s both where this weekend’s top flight fixtures were contested and all the Scottish accents I utilise in the space of a single sentence.</p>
      <p>Hamilton v <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> kicked off just as I was putting in my traditional Sunday lunchtime order of haggis, nukes and tatties. Ryan Jack put Rangers in front after just seven minutes, but Lewis Smith equalised six minutes later thanks to defending so uninspiring I mistook it for my leadership of the Liberal Democrats.</p>
      <p>Steven Gerrard left top goalscorer Alfredo Morelos on the bench, with the striker continuing to be the subject of intense transfer speculation. As a former Parliamentary Private Secretary to Nick Clegg, my advice to Rangers would be to tell interested clubs that they won’t have to pay a fee for Morelos, and then once you’ve gained their trust decide that, actually, you’ve dropped your pledge to scrap fees. The yellow card he picked up within minutes of replacing Jermain Defoe proved he’s not completely moved on from last season, when his disciplinary record was only marginally less problematic than my voting record.</p>
      <p>Ryan Kent restored Rangers’ advantage just before half-time, with a shot so powerful it was almost the exact opposite of my party’s appeal to voters. Kent scored his second late on to wrap up a 3-1 win for the visitors, ensuring that just like the 2019 General Election the title remains a two-horse race.</p>
      <p>It was a vital win for Rangers after <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> beat Livingston 4-0 on Saturday, avenging a 2-0 defeat earlier this season that was almost as uncomfortable to look back on as my decision to support the bedroom tax. An injury to Jonny Hayes was the only downside for Neil Lennon’s team, with the utility man somehow managing to remain on the pitch until the 50th minute despite having dislocated his shoulder early in the game. Despite overwhelming evidence that he wasn’t fit to compete, he limped on regardless. Not everything that happened during Celtic v Livingston was a metaphor for the Lib Dems’ election campaign though.</p>
      <p>Livingston’s star man was goalkeeper Matija Šarkić, without whom the margin of defeat could have been as high as the one polls are warning our party members to expect on December 12th. As Celtic mounted wave after wave of attack, Livi looked about as comfortable as a political leader repeatedly insisting that that they’re anti-fracking despite having received £14,000 in donations from a fracking businessman.</p>
      <p>Jack Ross led <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> to a 3-1 win victory against Motherwell at Easter Road in his first game as manager. Stephen Robinson’s men took the lead after nine minutes, but Hibs quickly turned the tables and Daryl Horgan’s late goal ensured there would be no way back for Motherwell. A brief period of hope at the start before watching the margin of defeat widen? I can relate, lol!</p>
      <p>Defender Andrew Considine made his 500th appearance for Aberdeen during their 1-1 draw with nine-man St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park. Considine’s displayed the kind of gluttony for punishment I’ve not seen since last week, when I lasted the whole of my Question Time grilling without walking off sporting the thousand-yard stare of a Vietnam veteran.</p>
      <p>St Mirren beat Ross County 2-1, but like my party’s manifestos since the tuition fees scandal the details are irrelevant. Besides, that game took place in Paisley and this Bearsden girl has standards.</p>
      <p>With 16 minutes played between Kilmarnock and Hearts at Rugby Park, the game was effectively over. Killie raced into a 3-0 lead, with Hearts looking so out of their depth on the Sportscene highlights I thought the BBC were showing my Question Time performance again. Chris Burke scored twice, as well as setting up Eamonn Brophy’s goal with the sort of stunning assist not seen since my party joined the Tories in a coalition government between 2010 and 2015.</p>
