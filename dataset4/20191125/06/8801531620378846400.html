      <h1>Jessica Lal Case: Delhi HC Asks Jail Authority To Take A Decision On Manu Sharma's Furlough Plea Within A Week</h1>

      <p>Delhi High Court has asked jail authorities in Tihar prison to decide upon Manu Sharma's furlough application within one week.</p>
      <p>Manu Sharma, who was convicted of murdering model Jessica Lal, and consequently serving a life sentence, had moved a furlough application before the Delhi High Court on the ground on maintaining the family ties.</p>
      <p>Arguing against the application, GNCTD's Standing Counsel (Criminal) Rahul Mehra argued that as per the Prison Manual, it is the jail authority that has to decide upon the furlough application.</p>
      <p>Mr Mehra also pointed out that Manu Sharma has been in an open jail for two years now. Prior to that, he was in a semi-open jail for another couple of years.</p>
      <p>Highlighting the need to address the application in light of the facts of the case, Mr Mehra said:</p>
      <p>'The convict was already provided with 3 furloughs and 1 parole for each year. Unfortunately we have different standards for different people. Three application is pending before the jail authorities, and they will decide upon in it accordingly. As per the Prison Manual, authorities are given a period of 4 weeks to decide upon a furlough application'.</p>
      <p>Replying to that statement, Sharma's counsel informed the court that the application has been pending for 9 weeks.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it was also pointed out that all the furloughs that were previously granted to the convict, were decided as per the law.</p>
      <p>In light of the submissions made, Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar directed the jail authorities to decide upon the furlough application with 7 days.</p>
      <p>Earlier in November, the Division Bench of Justice Manmohan and Justice Sehgal had asked the Delhi Government to file its reply to Manu Sharma's plea challenging the July order of the Sentence Review Board, which had rejected Sharma's demand for premature release.</p>
