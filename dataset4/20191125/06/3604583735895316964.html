      <p>For the vast majority of his life, Peter McMahon has been working hard to ensure other people's safety.</p>
      <p>The career firefighter has worked to help reduce harm with the Australian government, as well as around the globe.</p>
      <p>Now he faces what may be his biggest challenge, which will start by hopefully landing safely at one of the world's five most dangerous airports.</p>
      <p>Mr McMahon will travel to Bhutan, a tiny nation tucked between China and India.</p>
      <p>The nation is home to just over 800,000 people and is known as one of the happiest places in the world.</p>
      <p>Despite the general cheer of its population, Bhutan regularly deals with natural disasters, primarily earthquakes.</p>
      <p>Mr McMahon is hoping his trip will help the first responders of Bhutan be better prepared and better protected when they turn out to these events.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to just go over there and donate my time and expertise to help where I'm really needed," he said.</p>
      <p>"In terms of training, they have nothing so I'm going to show the proper way to safely turn out to these events.</p>
      <p>"I'll also be donating a heap of personal protective equipment (PPE)... the stuff they have now, they may as well not even be wearing any PPE, which a lot of them don't."</p>
      <p>While in Bhutan, Mr McMahon will also get the opportunity to sit down with Prime Minister Lotay Tshering and outline steps to help the nation progress in the emergency response sector.</p>
      <p>"I'll be meeting with the Prime Minister and talking directly with him about emergency preparedness and what they can do when disaster strikes."</p>
      <p>Mr McMahon says he just wants to lend a helping hand to a country without the majority of the resources available throughout much of the rest of the world.</p>
      <p>"What we're doing and what we're donating are all tangible things to help them be better resourced... it will 100 per cent save lives."</p>
