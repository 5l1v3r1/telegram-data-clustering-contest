      <p>Metro Vancouverites now have a new option for flights to destinations in B.C. and Alberta.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.airwestcharters.com/">Air West Charters</a>, which flies out of Delta’s Boundary Bay Airport, began offering chartered flights in June.</p>
      <p>The airline operates a 6-passenger plane known as the King Air 90, which has lower operating costs than other chartered jets. This, along with flying slower than other jets, means passengers will pay less.</p>
      <p>“Essentially, we can offer passengers the ability to save thousands of dollars in exchange for it costing them a moderate amount of extra time in the air,” said the airline’s chief pilot, Mark Watkins.</p>
      <p>The company, however, wouldn’t disclose what airfares cost, but did say flights typically cost thousands rather than hundreds.</p>
      <p>But, said Watkins, Air West offers flights for approximately 40 to 50 per cent of what jet aircraft charters charge.</p>
      <p>The planes flown by Air West have a range of 600 nautical miles (approximately 1,100 kilometres).</p>
      <p>The company currently flies to more than 80 airports across B.C. and Alberta, and is planning on offering flights to U.S. cities – such as Seattle, Portland or Great Falls, Montana – in early 2020.</p>

      <p>Because the aircraft is capable of landing on shorter runways, according to Watkins, it is able to access a much greater number of airports than many other jet charter aircraft.</p>
      <p>“That also helps reduce travel times because passengers can get closer to their intended destination without having to rely on ground transportation as much,” said Watkins.</p>
      <p>Boundary Bay Airport is located around seven kilometres south of the Massey Tunnel, and, due to its smaller size, allows for easier and faster boarding.</p>
      <p>According to Air West, passengers will be in the air within 20 minutes of arriving at the airport.</p>
