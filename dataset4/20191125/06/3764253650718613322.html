        <b>Nigerian singer, Oluwatosin Oluwole Ajibade, better known by his stage name, Mr Eazi, has taken to social media to blast the organisers of the Headies Awards for not giving him the car gift for an award he won three years ago.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Recall back in 2016, the singer's career grew impressively and it came as no surprise when <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1079033-mr-eazi-wins-headies-next-rated-award-2016.html">he was honoured with the Next Rated award at the 2016 Headies Award show,</a> an award which comes with a car gift.</p>
      <p>The controversy already surrounding the award show might have just gotten worse with the singer's new claims of not yet receiving the car gift even though it has been three years since he won the award.</p>

      <p>The official Twitter handle of the award show had made a tweet celebrating the singer and his girlfriend, Temi Otedola.</p>

      </p>
      <p>However, the singer was not flattered by this and instead, called them out about the car gift which he is yet to receive. Mr Eazi quoted the tweet with the caption: <i>"Instead make u gimme my car u dey here dey tweet couple goals."</i></p>
