      <p>A man was gunned down in a hail of bullets as he stood in his front garden yesterday evening.</p>
      <p>The latest <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/gangland-violence">gangland</a> murder victim Eoin Boylan, 22, died a short time after the shooting at Clonshaugh Avenue housing estate in Coolock, north <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/dublin">Dublin</a>.</p>
      <p>Armed <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/an-garda-siochana">gardai</a> and emergency services rushed to the scene after he was blasted six times by two hitmen at 5.15pm. He was blasted in the upper body, arm and chest.</p>
      <p>Boylan was treated at the scene by paramedics before being taken to Beaumont Hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later.</p>

      <p>It is understood at least two gunmen, who escaped in a Renault Clio, were involved in the shooting and gardai were last night searching for the getaway car.</p>
      <p>A neighbour said: “My sister-in-law heard the shot and she couldn’t believe it. He used to work as a milkman.</p>
      <p>“There is a feud around the area. But his mother is a lovely woman and it’s terrible for something like this to happen.”</p>
      <p>The latest murder is the fifth of the ongoing Coolock feud, which has so far claimed the lives of four men in their early twenties.</p>
      <p>Boylan was well known to gardai and it is understood he knew his life was in danger.</p>

      <p>The Coolock feud kicked off as criminal gangs tried to wrestle control of the drugs trade in the north Dublin area.</p>
      <p>The death of Zach Parker, 23, who was was gunned down outside a gym in Swords last January, ignited the murderous killing spree.</p>
      <p>One local man said: “It is shocking but it’s not really anymore to be honest. There’s so many of them. There was two of them a few months ago close by as well so it’s not really shocking at all.</p>
      <p>“And you see stuff going around and you know who’s at what.</p>
      <p>“But you just keep your head down and keep yourself to yourself and say nothing.</p>
      <p>“It is a bit shocking obviously, but it’s not surprising.</p>
      <p>“I would have known him [the victim] to see because I walk this way to work and I think there were at least two lads in the house.”</p>
      <p>The area around Clonshaugh Avenue was sealed off last night as forensic evidence was preserved and detectives combed the area for clues.</p>

      <p>A local woman, who did not want to be identified, said: “He only gave my daughter a lift home last weekend and he brought her home from [District 8 nightclub] in Swords.</p>
      <p>“We only really knew him to see and that night in Swords he knew her [my daughter] from living here and he gave her a lift home.</p>
      <p>“He seemed like a nice lad, he did me a favour bringing her home that night from [District 8] and he was very polite to her and dropped her right to the door.</p>
      <p>“He knew my brother as he did filming and stuff and he was complimenting her on her uncle as well.</p>
      <p>“He seemed like a lovely lad. He was always very polite and he’d always say hello to us when he was walking dogs and stuff, so it’s just terribly sad.</p>

      <p>“Young lads getting themselves involved in stupid s**t.</p>
      <p>“A lot of youngsters do but they don’t deserve something like this.”</p>
      <p>The teenage daughter said: “I just got talking to him outside the club in Swords and we couldn’t get a taxi then so he said he’d drop us home.</p>
      <p>“He was very nice.”</p>
      <p>Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan said yesterday: “I was deeply concerned to hear of the shooting this evening in the Clonshaugh area. I condemn this wanton violence.</p>
      <p>“I urge anyone with information to please contact An Garda Siochana and assist them with their investigation.”</p>
      <p>A Garda spokesman said: “Members of the Garda Technical Bureau are currently examining the scene and an incident room has been established at Coolock Garda Station.</p>
      <p>“The Coroner has been notified and the services of the State Pathologist have been requested. Arrangements are being made for a post-mortem examination.</p>
      <p>“Gardai are appealing for witnesses to come forward, they are also appealing to anyone with camera footage from the vicinity of Clonshaugh Avenue between 4.30pm and 5.30pm today to make it available to investigators.</p>
      <p>“Anyone with information is asked to contact Coolock Garda Station 01-6664200 or the Garda Confidential Line 1800 666 111."</p>
