      <p>Amazon.com Inc filed a lawsuit in a federal US court on Friday contesting the US Defense Department's decision last month to award a Pentagon cloud computing contract worth up to US$10 billion (Â£7.8 billion) to rival bidder Microsoft Corp .</p>
      <p>The complaint and supplemental motion for discovery were filed in the US Court of Federal Claims under seal, according to a spokesman for Amazon Web Services, a division of the online retail giant founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos.</p>
      <p>The company did not explain the basis for its complaint.</p>
      <p>The filings contain "proprietary information, trade secrets, and confidential financial information" that could "cause either party severe competitive harm," Amazon said in a court document seeking a protective order.</p>
      <p>"The record in this bid protest likely will contain similarly sensitive information," it said.</p>
      <p>Last week, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper rejected any suggestion of bias in the Pentagon's decision to award Microsoft the contract after Amazon announced plans to challenge it.</p>
      <p>"We believe the facts will show they (DoD) ran a detailed, thorough and fair process in determining the needs of the warfighter were best met by Microsoft," Microsoft said in an emailed statement.</p>
      <p>Amazon had been considered a favorite for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud (JEDI) contract, part of a broader digital modernization project at the Pentagon, before software developer Microsoft emerged as the surprise winner.</p>
      <p>Amazon has previously said that politics got in the way of a fair bidding process. Bezos, the chief executive officer of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post, has been an outspoken critic of US President Donald Trump.</p>
