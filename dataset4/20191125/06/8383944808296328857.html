      <p>Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) President Mustafa Akıncı expressed hope Sunday for making progress in reviving U.N.-led talks for a settlement in Cyprus.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters in Berlin ahead of a trilateral meeting Monday with his Greek Cypriot counterpart Nicos Anastasiades and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Akıncı said he would try to achieve positive results.</p>
      <p>"We came here with the hope and intention to make a positive step forward toward a solution to the Cyprus problem," he said.</p>
      <p>"Our wish, our goal would be to give good news to Cyprus."</p>
      <p>Akıncı said they would discuss a road map and exchange views on how to create conditions to move forward.</p>
      <p>He remained cautious about a probable five-party Cyprus conference in the coming months involving guarantor powers Turkey, Greece and the U.K., saying there is still more work needed to ensure that such a meeting would not be another unsuccessful attempt.</p>
      <p>The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved for decades despite a series of efforts by the UN for a lasting settlement between Turkish and Greek Cypriots.</p>
      <p>The latest attempt to resolve the problem ended with failure two years ago in Switzerland, and recent tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean have further complicated efforts for a settlement.</p>
      <p>The Greek Cypriot administration continues to oppose recognizing the political equality of Turkish Cypriots and claims to be the sole legitimate government of the whole of Cyprus.</p>
      <p>The island has been divided into a Turkish Cypriot government in the northern third and Greek Cypriot administration in the south since a 1974 military coup aimed at Cyprus' annexation by Greece.</p>
      <p>Turkey's intervention as a guarantor power in 1974 had stopped years-long persecution and violence against Turkish Cypriots by ultra-nationalist Greek Cypriots.</p>
      <p>The TRNC was founded in 1983.</p>
