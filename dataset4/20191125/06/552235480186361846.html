      <h1>Florian Kamberi pinpoints the key to Hibs surge as he hails Jack Ross impact</h1>
      <h2>The Swiss striker and partner Chris Doidge proved pivotal as the new boss delivered victory in his first game in charge.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Pilcher, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-pilcher/</a></address>
      <p>Florian Kamberi believes two is the magic number for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> in attack after he and Chris Doidge once again played a pivotal role in a second successive win.</p>
      <p>They had to come from behind to do it in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a>’ first game in the Easter Road dugout.</p>
      <p>But they proved that two is better than the one up front Paul Heckingbottom seemed too keen to persevere with.</p>
      <p>After Liam Polworth had put Motherwell in front, Doidge bundled in from close range to make it four goals in two games before Kamberi smashed the home side in front.</p>
      <p>Daryl Horgan’s late third allowed everyone to relax a bit as Hibs lifted themselves in to the Premiership top six.</p>
      <p>As far as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/florian-kamberi">Kamberi</a> is concerned, continuing to play him and Doidge together with Scott Allan pulling the strings behind them is the way forward.</p>

      <p>The Swiss striker said: “In my opinion we play a very good formation – 4-4-2 diamond with two up top.</p>
      <p>“The most successful time the club had was always with two up front and the last two games have been very good playing that way. That was the difference.</p>
      <p>“Everybody knows Scott can play the final pass. Doidgey’s very good in the air and I do all the other stuff on the floor, so it’s a very good mix of all three.”</p>
      <p>Having a manager in place that rates him is no doubt also a big help.</p>
      <p>Kamberi’s demeanour, along with some pointed comments suggested all was not well between him and ex-boss Heckingbottom.</p>
      <p>But given Ross had wanted to take him to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> before Hibs exercised an option to make his loan from Grasshoppers permanent in 2018, Kamberi was glad to see the former St Mirren manager take over.</p>
      <p>He added: “I knew him last summer because he tried to sign me for Sunderland. He’s a very good manager and a very good person.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t that close to signing. I just had a chat with him but it was nothing really close. I just wanted to meet him and see how he was as a person. He was great.</p>

      <p>“When I saw he was going to be appointed as the new manager here I was even happier.</p>
      <p>“He’s a quiet person. He knows exactly what he’s doing and he prepared us very well.”</p>
      <p>Ross had the option of either sticking with the side that dismantled St Johnstone in Perth prior to the international break, or putting his own stamp on things for his first match in charge.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly he opted to go with the formula that had worked so well under Eddie May and Grant Murray at McDiarmid Park,</p>
      <p>Despite an encouraging start by the home side, Motherwell’s first real attempt resulted in the opening goal.</p>
      <p>Jermaine Hylton’s clever feet bamboozled Vykintas Slivka and the wide man danced in to the box before setting up Jake Carroll.</p>
      <p>His low shot took a slight deflection that saw it come off the far post, but Polworth was on hand to apply a simple finish.</p>

      <p>But the leveller wasn’t long in coming. Kamberi’s through ball inside Liam Grimshaw put Joe Newell in on goal. He slid the ball under the advancing Gillespie although would likely have been cleared off the line but for Doidge following it in, and did enough to force it home at the back post.</p>
      <p>Less than five minutes later Ross’ team had turned the game on its head. As we’ve come to expect now, an Allan through ball was the source, putting Jason Naismith in behind.</p>
      <p>The full-back cut back for Doidge who saw his initial effort blocked.</p>
      <p>But Kamberi was alert enough to pick up the loose ball and showed good strength to holed off his man before smashing home from close range.</p>
      <p>Hibs appeared to get away with one in the second half. Chris Long’s nutmeg on Ryan Porteous took him past the recent Scotland call-up, and it looked for all the world like the defender had <br/>clumsily hauled in down as he moved towards goal.</p>
      <p>But ref John Beaton remained firm in his denial, despite Well’s protests. Just as an equaliser looked on the cards with the away side in the ascendency, Hibs wrapped it up on the counter.</p>
      <p>Stevie Mallan, fresh off the bench, provided the final pass of a sweeping move to set up fellow sub Horgan, who shot low across Gillespie in to the far corner. Should Kamberi maintain his <br/>level of performance domestically he will no doubt be included in the Albania squad once again after red tape prevented him making his debut last week.</p>
      <p>The hitman said: “The Swiss had to send some documents to UEFA but they didn’t. That was annoying.</p>
      <p>“The coach told me I was going to start against Andorra and play against France but then I was told the documents weren’t ready.</p>
      <p>“But I was happy to be there and meet everyone so now I’m looking forward to the next year.”</p>
