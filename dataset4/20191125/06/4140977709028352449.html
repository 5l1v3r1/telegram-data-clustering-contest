          <p>It is no secret that the Manchester United is vastly inferior to the ones that played under Alex Ferguson. However, when the manager says that the team has taken big strides after drawing a match against a newly promoted side, you know that the club has sunk into new lows.</p>

                <p>Manchester United started their match against Sheffield United on the backfoot. They first conceded in the 19<sup>th</sup> minute before letting another one in the 52<sup>nd</sup> minute. In that time Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side had only registered one shot on target in comparison to Sheffield United’s 6.</p>
                <p>United’s Academy graduates however, rose to the occasion and scored 3 goals in the span of 7 minutes to put the Red Devils in the driver’s seat. Brandon Williams first scored in the 72<sup>nd</sup> minute before Mason Greenwood added to the score in the 77<sup>th</sup> minute. Marcus Rashford then struck a couple of minutes later to put United ahead by a goal.</p>

                      <p>It seemed that United would leave Bramall lane with 3 points in the bag. However, Oli McBurnie levelled the scores after firing one behind the net in stoppage time. Most fans were disappointed at the team for allowing themselves to reach the point where even 3 goals couldn’t result in a victory. Ole Gunnar Soslkjaer though, has a different point of view.</p>

                      <p>United’s manager seemed content with the performance of the side and used their match against Everton last year as an example of why this team is better than the one, he managed last season.</p>

                          <p><i>“The difference between this team and last year’s team is huge,”</i> he told Sky Sports after the game. <i>“At 2-0, my mind is going back to Everton [where United lost 4-0 last season].</i></p>

                              <i>“No doubt about the drive, the energy, the attitude of these boys – they never give in.</i>
                            </p>
                            <p><i>“Last year we would have been three, four, or five down. This is such a big stride forward for them</i>.”</p>

                            <p>Surely the manager has to talk his players up in the press but there is no way Alex Ferguson or even Jose Mourinho would have called a draw against Sheffield United ‘big strides.’</p>
