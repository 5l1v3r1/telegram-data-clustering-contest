      <p>After a whirlwind week of exciting tennis action, it was <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/rafael-nadal">Rafael Nadal</a> who headlined the act for Team Spain and brought them a sixth <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/davis-cup-first-round">Davis Cup </a>title home. Team Spain did not allow the title to leave the Spanish soil as the Caja Magica lit up with the home country's magnificent victory. The revamped edition of the Davis Cup by Rakuten Madrid Finals showcased the 18 top nations of the world over a week of gripping tennis. Divided over six groups of three nations each, it was ultimately Team Spain, a 10-time finalist, and Team Canada, a debut finalist, who were the last two countries standing.</p>
      <p>Team Canada needs to be especially lauded for its efforts in the 108th edition of the Davis Cup as they went on to qualify for their first-ever finals here. Comprising mostly young under-23 players, Team Canada brought fresh energy and showed incredible promise. That said, it would be wrong to state that they were any match for the much more experienced and seasoned troop of Spaniards. Led by Rafael Nadal, Team Spain all but crushed the Canadian opposition and handed them a 2-0 defeat to bag the 6th Davis Cup title for Spain.</p>
      <p>The World No. 1 has been on a phenomenal run this week and he took the burden of his team almost single-handedly whilst delivering the winning act for Spain. Most spectacularly, Nadal has remained undefeated in all his singles and doubles ventures this week. In the first match, it was <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/roberto-bautista-agut">Roberto Bautista-Agut</a> who opened the campaign against Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime. Agut was relentless against the youngster and with a 7-6, 6-3 win, Spain were off to a positive start for the day.</p>

      <p>Soon enough, it was Rafael Nadal's turn to take to the court against Canada's best bet- Denis Shapovalov. The 20-year-old Shapovalov and Nadal were tied at 1-1 before the beginning of the match but a gritty performance by the World No. 1 against the determined Canadian first-time Davis Cup finalist, ensured it was the Spaniard who got his way. The quality of tennis was intense with Shapovalov really making Nadal go the distance but by the end, it was Rafa who had the last say with a nail-biting 6-3, 7-6 finish which won Team Spain their sixth Davis Cup title! With that emphatic performance, Rafael Nadal and Co. from Spain ensured that they are without a doubt the best tennis nation of the world.</p>
