        <figcaption>"Dearest Riaan, Every parent says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want him to grow up, I want to freeze this age forever‚Äù.. But I don‚Äôt.. I want to enjoy every year of yours, I want to see you grow into a fine young man, I want to give you wings to fly and I‚Äôd like to be the wind beneath those wings. I want to tell you that life is tough but you are tougher, I want you to always believe in yourself no matter what happens cause I will always believe in you.. Apart from everything I want and I wish for you, the one thing I never want to fail to let you know, is that I love you so so so much and you are the greatest thing that happened to me.. There is nothing I‚Äôd rather see than your smile and nothing I‚Äôd rather hear than your laughter. For all the things my hands have held, the best by far is you. Happy Birthday to the little boy who made me a Mom- My First Born ‚ù§Ô∏è," wrote Genelia sharing the photos. (Photo: Genelia D'Souza/Instagram)</figcaption>
