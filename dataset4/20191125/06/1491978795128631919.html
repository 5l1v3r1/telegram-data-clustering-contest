        <i><b>Brighton Dome<br/></b>In an endearing but gentle show, the comedian tries to leave his Father Ted alter ego behind</i>
      </p>
      <p>Father Dougal casts a long shadow, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/oct/29/ardal-ohanlon-interview-father-ted-death-in-paradise-standup-comedy-tour">Ardal O’Hanlon</a> laments at the start of his touring show. But it’s clear that the dopey sitcom alter ego is more a blessing than a curse. It gives him (as when I last saw him a decade ago) a winning opening to his set, as he demonstrates – with loveably low-status examples – how no one takes him remotely seriously. What better scene-setter for a show that offers up O’Hanlon himself (notwithstanding his recent commitment to a less dorky, more confessional mode) as the butt of plenty of its jokes.</p>
      <p>He’s still gorm-lite, then – but not gormless. Bemusement at the world comes as characteristic now, not caricature. The Showing Off Must Go On finds O’Hanlon buffeted by midlife’s currents: dad to terrifying teens, “a little bit afraid of” his wife, aghast at carrot cake and £17.50 gin and tonics. That’s a familiar comedian pose, and players of middle-aged standup bingo will soon be shouting “house!” as the jokes pile up about food served on slates and O’Hanlon forgetting why he’s entered the room.</p>
      <p>But if the setups are often familiar, the 54-year-old can be counted on for an idiosyncratic change of direction, as with the joke about life pre-smartphones that ends with O’Hanlon staring at imaginary porn on the palm of his empty hand. The same dusting of featherlight surrealism garlands a fun section on the Irish hatred of attention-seeking, and on the evaporation of the certainties (Santa, the tooth fairy and so on) we felt as children.</p>
      <p>It all adds up to an endearing if gentle show, with the biggest laughs coming from a reading of the alarming label on O’Hanlon’s anxiety medication. There’s a little light raillery, too, at England’s Brexit travails (delivered in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/31/terry-wogan-intriguingly-subversive-national-treasure">Terry Wogan</a> lilt at which no Brit could possibly take umbrage) plus tales of O’Hanlon’s unglamorous upbringing, and act-your-age commentary on the antics of his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/stormzy">Stormzy</a>-quoting contemporaries. It’s a more worldly-wise O’Hanlon, then, who comes to the fore – even if the guileless ghost of Dougal is never entirely dispelled.</p>
