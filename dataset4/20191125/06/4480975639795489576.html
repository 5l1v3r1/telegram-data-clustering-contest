      <p>As the market focus remains on US-China trade developments, analysts at Danske Bank outlined this week's important market-moving economic releases.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>“Focus continues to be on US-China trade talks and the tentative signs of a bottoming in the global business cycle. Today, the German ifo index will provide more clues to the state of the euro area economy. A rise in <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">manufacturing PMI</a> new orders on Friday points to some upside risk to the ifo expectations index. Overall we expect the euro business cycle to stay soft in the short term but a gradual recovery in early 2020.”</p>
      <p>“Over the coming week, the main <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> to watch will be the core durable goods orders (a good capex indicator) and inflation data out of both the US and <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">the euro</a> area.”</p>
      <p>“In Scandi, focus this week turns to consumer and business surveys and Q3 GDP in Sweden as well as unemployment and retail sales in Norway.”</p>
