      <p>British writer Lee Child, creator of the Jack Reacher thriller series, is reportedly applying for an Irish passport due to Brexit.</p>
      <p>Child, whose real name is James Grant, has sold more than 100 million books.</p>
      <p>He lives between the UK and the US but is entitled to an Irish passport as his father was born in Belfast.</p>
      <blockquote>If he had gone to my school (Boris Johnson) would not now be prime minister<cite>Lee Child</cite></blockquote>
      <p>The author said he wants an Irish passport to avoid the possibility of post-Brexit travel restrictions in Europe.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t got the passport yet but I will do very soon, it feels like I’m cheating to be honest as I will get in the back door,” Child told The Irish Times.</p>
      <p>He was speaking in Berlin as part of a European “Friendship Tour”, where Child and fellow British authors Kate Mosse, Jojo Moyes and Ken Follett spoke out against Brexit.</p>
      <p>“I am not a huge fan of Britain, even though I was born there.</p>
      <p>“It’s a silly and frustrating country, which is why I moved to America,” Child said.</p>
      <p>He also criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnson, portraying him as an elitist.</p>
      <p>“If he had gone to my school he would not now be Prime Minister,” said Child.</p>
      <p>Child’s new book, Blue Moon, has just been released.</p>
