      <p><b>New Delhi: </b>Congress on Monday went on an offensive over the <a href="https://www.india.com/news/india/in-massive-twist-devendra-fadnavis-takes-oath-as-maharashtra-cm-ajit-pawar-deputy-cm-3853881/">current political situation in Maharashtra</a>, with siblings Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi breaking their silence on the issue. Party president, and their mother, Sonia Gandhi, meanwhile, led a Congress protest outside the Parliament.</p>
      <p>Speaking in the ongoing winter session for the first time, Rahul, the party’s Wayanad MP, said in the Lok Sabha, “I wanted to ask a question in the House but it doesn’t make any sense to ask a question right now.”</p>
      <p>“Democracy has been murdered in Maharashtra”, the former national president of the party said.</p>
