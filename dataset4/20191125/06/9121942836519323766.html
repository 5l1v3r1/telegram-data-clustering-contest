      <h3>Movie review</h3>
      <p>Count me among those who wouldn’t have guessed that Rian Johnson would follow up his “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” success with an old-fashioned whodunit — but count me delighted. In this season of Big, Serious Movies, what a treat to find this wonderfully silly, perfectly paced hall of mirrors hanging out at the multiplexes. It’s as if Agatha Christie came back for a visit, after getting caught up on pop culture in the beyond.</p>
      <p>The plot is absolutely what you think it is, and exactly what it should be: Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) — a bestselling crime-fiction author and wealthy patriarch of a squabbling family — is found dead in his gothic New England mansion, just after the clan had gathered for his 85<sup>th</sup> birthday. Enter detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) — a sort of Hercule Poirot, minus mustache and plus syrupy drawl — who intends to get to the bottom of this, yaaas indeed he does.</p>

      <p>And off we go, through a thicket of characters and motives and clues scattered all over the house (it’s as if Harlan lives inside an extremely lavish solve-the-mystery board game; pay attention to the details). Turns out that pretty much all of Harlan’s children, children-in-law and grandchildren are crawling with motives to bump him off and collect his sizable estate, even as they loudly pretend they don’t. Among the crowd, I particularly enjoyed Toni Collette’s preening lifestyle-guru daughter-in-law (her wellness company, inexplicably and perfectly, is called Flam), Chris Evans’ besweatered trust-fund-brat grandson and Jamie Lee Curtis’ slyly wary eldest daughter. And Plummer, mostly through flashbacks and one very realistic portrait on the wall, provides an indelible presence.</p>
      <p>But it’s Craig, expanding on that goofball capacity he <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/logan-lucky-review-steven-soderbergh-returns-with-another-heist-film/">showed us ever-so-briefly in “Logan Lucky,”</a> who steals the show here. “My presence will be ornamental,” he promises early on, slouching in a chair and letting the words slide out like taffy. He’s having even more fun than we are — and that’s saying a lot, because “Knives Out” is a kick. By the time it was finally revealed whodunit, I just wanted to start over and play again.</p>
      <p>_____</p>
