      <p>CLEVELAND — A woman who says her son was killed by gang members connected to an Ohio mayor’s grandson has filed a wrongful death lawsuit saying the mayor and a police chief interfered in the slaying’s investigation.</p>
      <p>Andrea Parra’s 30-year-old son Antonio was fatally shot Aug. 28 in Cleveland. Authorities says suspects were seen fleeing in a car registered to Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson’s grandson, Frank Q. Jackson.</p>
      <p>Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael O’Malley has said Frank Q. Jackson is a “prime suspect” in the slaying and that the investigation should be turned over to an outside agency.</p>
      <p>In a YouTube video, the mayor denied interfering with any criminal investigations involving his grandson. A Cleveland spokeswoman says the city had no comment about the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>Frank Q. Jackson’s attorney didn’t return messages seeking comment.</p>
