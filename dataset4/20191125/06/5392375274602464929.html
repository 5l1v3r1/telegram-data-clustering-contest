      <p>Along with the most interesting <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/25/huawei-matepad-pro-official/">Huawei MatePad Pro</a>, a tablet that’s expected to compete with Apple’s iPad Pro, the Chinese tech giant also announced a new series of laptops – meet the Huawei MateBook D 14 and MateBook D 15.</p>

      <p>As the name suggests, the difference between the two models is in the size of the display. A 14-inch panel for the smaller and 15.6-inch for the bigger brother. But these aren’t the only specs that differ between the laptops, as a matter of fact Huawei decided to bring as many versions as possible, including Intel and Ryzen alternatives as well.</p>
      <p>So, let’s start with the most affordable of them all, the Huawei MateBook D 14 Ryzen Edition with a price tag of 3999 Yuan, around $570. The laptop does, of course, feature a 14-inch panel of the IPS type with 1920x1080p resolution. We then find 4.8mm thin bezels, a screen to body ratio of 84% and 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
      <h3>Huawei MateBook D 14 &amp; 15 Announced, Both with Intel &amp; Ryzen CPUs</h3>

      <p>Internal specs wise, the MateBook D 14 Ryzen Edition features a Ryzen R5 CPU, 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. There’s also a variant with 16GB of RAM selling for 4299 Yuan ($610).</p>
      <p>Moving onto the ordinary MateBook D 14 (or Intel edition), this lineup features either an Intel i5 or i7 10th generation CPU, 8GB or 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD internal storage. On the graphics size, all variants sport an Nvidia MX250 GPU. Prices for the Intel versions go from 5199 Yuan ($740) for i5 / 8GB RAM; 5499 Yuan ($780) for i5 / 16GB; and 6499 Yuan ($920) for i7 / 16GB / 512GB.</p>

      <p>Finally, as far as the Huawei MateBook D 14 is concerned, the laptop supports 65W fast charging, it’s 15.9mm thick and weighs 1.38Kg.</p>
      <p>As we previously mentioned, there’s also the MateBook D 15; basically the same PC with the main difference being the screen size. The display here is 15.6-inch, for a total body thickness of 16.9mm and a weight of 1.62kg.</p>

      <p>The Huawei MateBook D 15 series comes with around the same prices as the 14-inch variant, but we get different storage configurations.
