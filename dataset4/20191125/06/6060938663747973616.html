      <h1>Man comes up with clever bottle-feeding hack; wins dad of the year!</h1>

      <p>When babies are little, breastfeeding is the best form of nutrition for them. There's no better alternative than mother's milk. However, motherhood is tough and exhausting and you can't always be there by your baby's side to manage the feeding schedules, clean up or take care of the baby. Hence, bringing up a new baby is the time when you need as many hands on deck, particularly from the dads!</p>
      <p>Fathers play a crucial rule too in bringing up babies. When moms are busy, fathers take on the job- taking care of the baby, making them sleep and even feeding them.</p>
      <p>This dad, in particular, is winning a lot of praise on the internet for his clever trick to bottle feed his baby when the mama was away!</p>
      <p>Two-week-old baby girl Ava was hungry and giving her milk was the only thing that was going to help her fussiness. Sadly, her mom was away and Ava wouldn't drink through the bottle. This left dad Allen a little room to improvise and a baby to feed. So, he put his brain to good use and inspired many other dads along the line.</p>
      <p>Inventing a brilliant feeding hack, Allen introduced a unique bottle feeding technique for dads around the world to feed their children. Because Ava won't take the bottle, Allen decided to make use of opportunities and stimulate natural breastfeeding by cutting a "hole" in his shirt and placing the milk bottle underneath!</p>
      <p>It took a little try and garnered confusing looks from the baby, but both Allen and Ava were able to do the job well! Soon after his hack worked, he decided to share this parenting tip on the internet and went viral in no time!</p>
      <p>Sharing a few pictures and a video alongside, dad Allen wrote:</p>

      <p>“My wife left the house and the baby got hungry. [She] wouldn’t take the bottle and I didn’t know what to do,”</p>
      <p>“The baby knew something wasn’t the same but she took it because I guess she felt comfortable,”</p>
      <p>The tweet gathered over 5.1 million views, love and a lot of comments from fellow parents and netizens who called him 'dad of the year'.</p>

      <p>In an interview, Allen said that he did this because he wanted to show parents around the world that both parents have to pitch in, make efforts while parenting and show people that there's more than one way to do something.</p>

      <p>He also added that his wife was exhausted and he wanted to help her out, any way possible. He said:</p>
      <p>“Whenever you care about somebody you’ll do anything to make it work, even when you don’t have the resources.”</p>
      <p>When the mom finally came back, she was all laughs about her husband's clever parenting hacks!</p>
