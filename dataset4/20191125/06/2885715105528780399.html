      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:14:42+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>India’s economic growth is expected to slow further in the second half of the year, Singapore’s DBS Bank said on Monday.</p>
      <p>“Real GDP is likely to print 4.3 per cent YoY in 3Q vs 2Q’s 5 per cent, nearing the trough for this cycle,” DBS said in its daily economic report.</p>
      <p>Weakness in the crucial consumption sector is likely to be extended into the quarter along with tepid private sector activity.</p>
      <p>New project announcements remain at a multi-year low, while production was depressed by weak consumer durables, non-durables, intermediate and capital goods, the bank pointed out.</p>
      <p>Surveys by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reflect downbeat consumer sentiments towards income and employment conditions.</p>
      <p>Indirect and direct tax collections also reflected slower demand, as did sluggish credit growth as banks and non-banks tightened due diligence, it said.</p>
      <p>Providing a counterweight, fiscal spending likely quickened after slower disbursements in the first half of the year due to the general elections.</p>
      <p>Net trade is unlikely to be a drag with weak exports accompanied by a sharper fall in non-oil, non-gold imports.</p>
      <p>“Under GVA (Gross Value Added), we expect 4.1 per cent print, with most sectors barring public administration to have slowed in the quarter,” said DBS.</p>
      <p>The third quarter economic numbers are due this week.</p>
