      <p>Rohtang tunnel, that is a strategically important project may become operational soon. This is what official sources have stated. This 8.8 km long tunnel is of utmost importance as it will ensure all-weather connectivity to <a href="https://www.india.com/travel/articles/5-beautiful-valleys-of-ladakh-3231513/">Ladakh</a> areas that are close to the borders of China and Pakistan. This road tunnel is being built at an elevation of 10171 ft under the <a href="https://www.india.com/travel/articles/manali-to-rohtang-pass-how-to-reach-rohtang-pass-from-manali-by-road-3239177/">Rohtang Pass</a>. The Rohtang tunnel, after being operational, will reduce the distance between Keylong and Manali by approximately 45 km.</p>
      <p>According to the officials belonging to the ongoing project, this 8.8 long Rohtang tunnel may become operational by May 2020 and will be a boon for the people living in the cold deserts of Lahaul Valley. Notably, this horseshoe-shaped cross-section tunnel will be 11.25 meters wide and will give enough space for two-way traffic.</p>
      <p>According to the latest reports, Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh recently asked Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur to speed up the construction work which is going on for a long time now. Also, he urged him to improve the condition of roads in the valley.</p>
      <p>Notably, Rohtang Pass remains operational for the people for just 5 months. This is because of the extreme <a href="https://www.india.com/travel/articles/to-experience-snowfall-this-season-head-to-almora-in-uttarakhand-3514494/">snowfall</a> the place receives and cut off more than 20,000 people from the rest of the country owing to the closure of the Rohtang Pass.</p>
      <p>That is the reason this Rs.1,495-crore project was introduced in 2010 by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi. This project has been given to the BRO in collaboration with Strabag-Afcons.</p>
