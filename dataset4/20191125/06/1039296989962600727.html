      <p>Refreshed Mustang will be sold with a re-tuned V8 engine in India; may feature a new 10-speed gearbox, additional paint shades and more.</p>
      <p>Ford India will bring the updated Mustang to our shores in the second half next year. The updated Mustang has been on sale internationally for quite some time and was first unveiled at the 2018 Frankfurt Motor Show.</p>
      <p>The India-spec Mustang facelift will continue to be sold with the same 5.0-litre, V8 engine seen in the pre-facelift model. However, the motor has now been upgraded to 450hp (up from the previous 415hp). The big news is that Ford plans to pair the engine with a 10-speed automatic gearbox instead of the 6-speed torque convertor unit that was on offer before.</p>
      <p>As part of the mid-cycle refresh, Ford has lowered the Mustang's bonnet and integrated air vents onto it, while the grille has been redesigned to form a slimmer, sleeker unit. The rear end of the car has been tweaked with a redesigned bumper and diffuser. The iconic sportscar also gets reshaped headlamps, which go well with the updated looks.</p>
      <p>The new Mustang also gets three additional exterior paint shades – blue, orange and red – and gets a new 19-inch alloy wheel design, which is available in three finishes.</p>
      <p>The interior gets a new 12.0-inch LCD instrument display and a more generous use of soft-touch plastics on the centre console and doors. Equipment has been updated to include LED lights as standard, and adaptive cruise control is available too. Expect more details about the India-bound Ford Mustang to surface closer to its market launch and price announcement.</p>
