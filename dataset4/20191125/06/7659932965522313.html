      <p>Hezbollah and Amal movement supporters attacked overnight anti-government protesters who had been rallying on a main bridge in Beirut.<br/><br/>The confrontations began after dozens of supporters of the parties arrived on scooters and attacked the protesters at the Ring Bridge with clubs and metal rods, chanting pro-Hezbollah slogans. Riot police and soldiers then formed a human barrier, separating between the two sides.<br/><br/>Groups of young men threw stones at each other for hours, with security forces in the middle. Several people were beaten and injured.<br/><br/>Security forces fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, three local television stations reported.<br/><br/>They shouted insults and chanted in support of the chiefs of the Hezbollah and Amal, before briefly breaking through and attacking some demonstrators.<br/><br/>Those at the roadblock chanted "peaceful, peaceful", as the security forces and army reinforcements deployed in a thick line between both sides in the early hours of Monday morning. <br/><br/>The counter-protesters also headed to a main nerve center of protests nearby and destroyed tents there, a local television channel said.<br/><br/>The Lebanese civil defense said on its Twitter account that it was administering first aid to five people suffering from “various injuries.”<br/><br/>Calm has since been restored and the bridge has been reopened.<br/><br/>Hezbollah supporters have attacked the main protest camp in central Beirut on at least two occasions, destroying tents set up by protesters. The protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful.<br/><br/>Lebanon has faced five weeks of anti-government protests, fueled by anger at corruption among the sectarian politicians who have governed Lebanon for decades. Demonstrators want to see the entire ruling class gone from power.<br/><br/>Hezbollah and Amal were both represented in the coalition government led by Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who quit on October 29 after the protests began. Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, had opposed Hariri’s resignation.<br/><br/>Politicians have failed to agree on a new cabinet since, despite a rapidly deteriorating economic crisis.<br/><br/>The leaderless protesters say they are blocking roads to exert pressure on politicians to form a new government.<br/><br/>The unprecedented nationwide protests were triggered by proposed new taxes, including on the use of the WhatsApp mobile app. They came on the heels of an austerity budget that cut public spending, pensions and employee benefits to tackle a deepening economic crisis.<br/><br/>They have since evolved into calls for the entire political class, of which Hezbollah is part, to leave.</p>
