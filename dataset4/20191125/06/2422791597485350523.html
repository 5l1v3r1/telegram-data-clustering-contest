      <p>CALGARY -- The Winnipeg Blue Bombers ended a 29-year championship drought by defeating the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 33-12 in the 107th Grey Cup from McMahon Stadium in Calgary.</p>
      <p>Here's a look at five big moments from the game:</p>
      <p>---</p>
      <p>
        <b>EARLY TURNOVERS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Coming into this CFL title game, teams with the better turnover ratio had won 23 of the last 24 Grey Cups.</p>
      <p>That might explain why the Bombers' defence wasted no time trying to create some takeaways.</p>
      <p>On Hamilton's third offensive play from scrimmage, quarterback Dane Evans' first pass in a Grey Cup went off the hands of Jaelon Acklin and right into the arms of Brandon Alexander for an interception.</p>
      <p>Then, less than three minutes later, Evans coughed up the football again thanks to two of the Bombers' best and brightest. First, the newly-crowned most outstanding defensive player Willie Jefferson came in with the strip-sack, followed by the former most outstanding defensive player Adam Bighill who recovered the ball in Ticats' territory.</p>
      <p>That series of events led to the first points of the game as Andrew Harris scored on a 15-yard touchdown run on the very next play.</p>
      <p>The tone set by Winnipeg's defence was unquestionably the catalyst that led to their 15-point lead by halftime.</p>
      <p>---</p>
      <p>
        <b>HARRIS'S MONSTER FIRST HALF</b>
      </p>
      <p>After scoring the game's opening touchdown, Harris continued to show off his versatility on the CFL's biggest stage.</p>
      <p>Around the midway point of the second quarter, Harris put together his longest run of the first half with a 21-yard carry. He then followed that up, on the very next snap, by making one of the plays of the game.</p>
      <p>On an 18-yard pass from Chris Streveler, Harris stretched out for a diving catch in the end zone for his second touchdown of the half.</p>
      <p>He picked up 88 yards in the first half alone, averaging 10.6 yards per carry.</p>
      <p>---</p>
      <p>
        <b>SPEEDY BANKS INJURY</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brandon Banks caught 5-of-6 targets for 67 yards in the first half, but this year's most outstanding player was absent for much of the game's final two quarters.</p>
      <p>On Hamilton's first play of the second half, Banks was injured when Bombers' defensive back Mike Jones landed a big hit on the 31-year-old wideout. The league's leading receiver left the game with a lower-body injury and wouldn't return.</p>
      <p>Banks led the CFL in catches (112), receiving yards (1,550) and touchdown (13) this season. His departure from the game will have hindered any potential rally by the Ticats.</p>
      <p>---</p>
      <p>
        <b>THE TOUCHDOWN THAT WASN'T</b>
      </p>
      <p>Trailing 27-12 early in the fourth quarter, it appeared for a moment that Hamilton might be in the midst of a comeback.</p>
      <p>On second and long, Evans heaved the ball 50 yards to a wide-open Mike Jones, who had split a couple of defenders and found himself in a position to score.</p>
      <p>But the Ticats receiver couldn't corral the pass. He dropped the ball inside the five-yard line, preventing what could have been a game-changing play in this 107th Grey Cup.</p>
      <p>To make matters worst, Jones was slow getting up and needed help getting off the field.</p>
      <p>---</p>
      <p>
        <b>DEFENCE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Blue Bombers' defence had already created four turnovers through three quarters and held one of the CFL's most prolific offences to just 12 points.</p>
      <p>However, that wasn't enough for Winnipeg.</p>
      <p>With under six minutes to go, Jefferson made sure Evans felt his presence once again. This season's most outstanding defensive player came up with another strip-sack, before the Ticats recovered the loose ball.</p>
      <p>Then, on the very next play, Hamilton wasn't so lucky.</p>
      <p>On second and 26, Winnipeg's defensive end Jackson Jeffcoat came up with a sack, strip and fumble recovery of his own.</p>
      <p>It marked one of seven turnovers committed by the Ticats, and one of six sacks by the Bombers.</p>
