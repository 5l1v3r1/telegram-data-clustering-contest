      <h2>A whopping 25,418 people were given fines for travelling without a ticket between January 1 and October 24 this year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sonia Sharma</a></address>
      <p>Thousands of people have been caught trying to dodge Metro fares this year - and we can reveal the stations where most ticket dodgers were stopped.</p>
      <p>A Freedom of Information request by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/">ChronicleLive </a>shows that a staggering 25,418 people were handed penalty fare notices between January 1 and October 24 this year.</p>
      <p>Of those, the most were caught at Monument station, where 3,106 fines were issued.</p>
      <p>Central Station was second with 2,316 notices given out, followed by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-shields">North Shields</a>, where 2,287 passengers were caught without a ticket.</p>
      <p>During the 10-month period, Nexus collected around £197,418 in fines.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/nexus">Nexus</a>, which owns and operates Metro, says Monument is at the top of the list because it is the busiest station on the network.</p>
      <p>Huw Lewis, customer services director, added: "Metro is a public service, Nexus does not seek to make a profit and every penny we receive in fares goes back into meeting the cost of operating the system.</p>
      <p>"When people cheat their fare they are choosing to starve Metro of the money we need to pay people’s wages and maintain the system – they may also be prosecuted and end up with a criminal record.</p>
      <p>"The money we claim back in penalty fare notices - £20 each time we stop someone, and more in admin payments if we have to chase them for payment – goes back into <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/tyne-and-wear-metro">Metro</a> alongside normal fares income.</p>
      <p>"We have increased the number of customer service staff we have to the highest number ever, and this means we can do more roving patrols, as well as protecting revenue on the 75% of journeys that pass through gates at busier stations.</p>
      <p>"Metro fares offer really good value, from as little as £1 a journey for 16-18 year olds, even less for children, and less than £5 all day for the longest journeys by adults with Pop Pay As You Go.</p>
      <p>"Payment is simple by cash, card or online. It is simply not worth cheating Metro and other passengers."</p>
      <p>Here's a look at the Metro stations where the most fare dodgers were caught:</p>
