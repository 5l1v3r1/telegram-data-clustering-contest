      <p>Haydn ‘Ed’ Smith is 26 and ‘not the best coach in the world but football mad.’</p>
      <p>He’s had an Argyle season ticket since he was six.</p>
      <p>Haydn and his wife Alex lost Michael in March 2018.</p>
      <p>He told me: “She essentially went into pre-term labour at just under 21 weeks, so when he was born, he wasn’t viable.</p>
      <p>“He was alive for two hours, which is a miracle.</p>
      <p>“That’s why we’re in this situation. We had a lot of support from different charities. <a href="https://www.sands.org.uk/">Sands</a> being one. <a href="http://www.ltandco.org/">Little Things</a> have been our main group.”</p>
      <p>This led to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sandsunitedfcplymouth/">Sands United Plymouth</a>, a football team that has been set up by bereaved parents, for bereaved parents.</p>
      <p>The main aim is to get dads together and give them the opportunity to represent their angel babies.</p>

      <p>Haydn continued: “I heard about the team and always loved football. Alex suggested the idea of setting it up, I turned it down at first.</p>
      <p>“But then I messaged them, asked if they thought about setting up a team down here. They gave me the team logo and said shoot on and do it.</p>
      <p>“That was five weeks ago, since then it’s become a real thing. We’ve got kits ordered.”</p>
      <p>Haydn and Alex have been married since October 2017. They are currently trying for another baby and are being referred for fertility treatments. They’ve had two miscarriages since Michael.</p>
      <p>Haydn spoke about how he felt at the time, he said: “I was on my notice period at work when we lost Michael, I couldn’t go straight in and say that.</p>
      <p>“You feel alone. There isn’t a lot of male based support, and it’s trying to reach those. It is dark.</p>
      <p>“I struggled to talk about it. I keep it in and you get pent-up anger. People don’t understand you when you talk about it. You get sympathy, you don’t get empathy.</p>

      <p>“It’s hard. You don’t realise you’re bad. It’s just the norm. You’re down, and that’s it.</p>
      <p>“When you sit back and think about it, it’s hard to notice when someone is down. It’s hard to notice when you are down.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t have anyone to talk to. You find it hard to talk to people. As soon as you mention it they back off. They don’t want to upset you.</p>
      <p>“You get to a point where you’re seeing people and they’re scared to share their life with you.</p>
      <p>“Our best friend had a baby and they didn’t want to post any pictures in our group chat.</p>
      <p>“I said we’re not bitter. But I can understand. It’s hard to explain.”</p>

      <p>How has the team helped him? He said: “The best way to cure mental health is to get out.</p>
      <p>“The idea of getting everyone out there together, they can talk about it and have a run around. You’re destressing.</p>
      <p>“Everyone is in the same situation and nobody feels uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>“There are people there who haven’t suffered baby loss, but their friends have. It impacts the friends as much as it does the dads, the brothers, the uncles.”</p>
      <p>Alex agreed.</p>
      <p>Haydn said: “We’ve had a couple of players come along, our friends. We didn’t know anything was wrong. They’ve reached out to us, they’ve had miscarriages.”</p>
      <p>“It helps me to realise I’m not the only one. That’s the aim of it, to get everyone together.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had loads of support. We’ve had local people ringing up with kit and equipment donated.</p>
      <p>“People coming is more of a help than people giving money in some cases. The support people get from others coming along and speaking, it’s better.”</p>
      <p>The team currently has 15 players but are in touch with people in Exeter and Tavistock. They play in the Sunday evening six-a-side league at Manadon and are looking to join the 11-a-side league in the future.</p>

      <p>Haydn encourages anyone to join, he said: “Just come along, it’s worth it. Rather than coming and just playing football, we want it so people come and talk to each other.</p>
      <p>“I never used to speak about it. The main help for me is seeing people like Stevie come and talk about it.”</p>
      <p>Stevie Clements, 19, did take the plunge to come along last week and has been in touch since the beginning of the team.</p>
      <p>He was 11-years-old when his little brother Oliver was stillborn and has suffered with his mental health since.</p>
      <p>With the encouragement of his proud mother, he said: “It’s not easy to get over.</p>
      <p>“Going through it is not a nice experience. You see your family upset and all struggling.</p>
      <p>“It takes its toll.</p>
      <p>“These are the first people I’ve opened up to about it. I don’t like to talk about because it’s still an emotional subject.</p>
      <p>“Ed and the team help because you can talk to them and release your feelings. It’s not very often I get to do that.”</p>
      <p>His mum is overjoyed that Stevie’s getting out again. She dropped him to his first training session and smiled when she told me how he walked by himself from the car park to the pitch.</p>
      <p>Like Ed, Stevie is a lifelong football fan. I asked if he’d always been a keeper, he joked: “Yeah, best place for me.”</p>
      <p>We carried on talking about the team. He said: “It’s getting out and getting myself to go to the training because of the anxiety. Meeting new people is difficult for me.</p>
      <p>“I don’t like meeting new people and talking about it, it’s too emotional. He’s my little brother and I just wanted to see him grow up.”</p>

      <p>Morgan Parsonage is the sports hub coordinator at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ManadonSportsHub/">Manadon Sports and Community Hub</a>. They’ve provided equipment and support to the team.  </p>
      <p>Morgan said: “They got in contact a couple months ago and told us what they’re about. We like the idea of everything they’re trying to do for their community.</p>
      <p>“We offered them our astro every Saturday which they book and they’ve entered our six-a-side league on a Sunday.</p>
      <p>“It’s rewarding to help people going through what they’ve been through. To give them a place to come and not have to worry about anything.</p>
      <p>“To enjoy football and have a laugh, that’s what we’re about.”</p>
      <p>Below is some information from <a href="https://www.sands.org.uk/">Sands</a>, a stillborn and neonatal death charity.</p>
      <p>“Sadly, the death of a baby is not a rare event.</p>
      <p>“The latest statistics published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that the number of babies who are stillborn or die within 4 weeks of birth in the UK has fallen to an average of 14 babies a day.</p>
      <p>“That’s 345 fewer baby deaths in 2018 than in 2017.</p>
      <p>“In the UK in 2018, one in every 250 births was a stillbirth. In total there were 2,958 stillbirths.</p>
      <p>“Around one-third of stillbirths happen after 37 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
      <p>“Stillbirths account for more than half of the deaths of infants under one year in the UK.</p>
      <p>“In the UK in 2018, 2,028 babies died within 4 weeks of birth. That’s one baby in every 360 births.</p>
      <p>“A stillborn baby is one who has died before or during birth at or after 24 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
      <p>“A neonatal death happens in the first 28 days after birth.”</p>
