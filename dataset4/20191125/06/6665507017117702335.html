      <h1>Why Sanjay Manjrekar's Comments Against Harsha Bhogle Has Twitter Riled Up</h1>
      <h2>Manjrekar has landed himself in another controversy after his "bits and pieces" remark against Ravindra Jadeja.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:49:37+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:49</time> by <a rel="author">Akshita Jain</a></address>
      <p>Just a few months after Sanjay Manjrekar received severe <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/cricket-world-cup-fans-rush-to-ravindra-jadejas-aid-troll-sanjay-manjrekar-for-verbal-diarrhea-after-twitter-spat-2216511.html">flak for calling</a> Ravindra Jadeja “a bits and pieces player”, the former cricketer has landed himself in another controversy for his on-air comments against Harsha Bhogle. </p>
      <p>During the third day of the day/night Test between India and Bangladesh, Bhogle suggested that the players need to be asked about the visibility of the pink ball, according to <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/india-vs-bangladesh-2019-20/day-night-test-fans-ask-sanjay-manjrekar-to-apologise-to-harsha-bhogle-heres-why-2137861"><i>NDTV</i></a>. He also asked for a proper analysis of the pink ball Test during the commentary. </p>
      <p>“Don’t think so. Because when you see the slip catchers the way they have taken catches, I don’t think visibility is an issue at all. The texture of the ball is the issue,” responded Manjrekar, according to <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/sanjay-manjrekars-rude-jibe-at-harsha-bhogle-over-pink-ball-visibility-has-angered-fans-2398635.html"><i>News18</i></a>.</p>

      <p>Bhogle, however, said that he would ask the players from both sides.</p>
      <p>Manjrekar, according to the <i>NDTV</i> report, replied, “only you need to ask Harsha, not us, who have played a fair bit of the game.”</p>
      <p>Manjrekar further added that he could perhaps say that with some authority after having played 10-15 years of first-class cricket. Bhogle, according to <i>News18</i>, responded by saying, “having played cricket should never be a limitation or a ceiling to learning.”</p>
      <p>Manjrekar’s comments did not go down well with Twitter users who asked him to apologise to Bhogle. </p>

      <p>Others said that they were switching channels to avoid Manjrekar’s commentary. </p>

      <p>In July, Jadeja had also hit out at Manjrekar over his “bits and pieces” statement and said he had “heard enough of your verbal diarrhoea”.</p>
      <p>“Still I have played twice the number of matches you have played and I am still playing. Learn to respect people who have achieved. I have heard enough of your verbal diarrhoea,” Jadeja had tweeted.</p>
      <p>After Jadeja’s brilliant performance in the World Cup semifinal, Manjrekar admitted that he has been “ripped apart on all fronts”.</p>
      <p>“By bits ‘n’ pieces of sheer brilliance, he’s ripped me apart on all fronts. This is the Jadeja we haven’t seen before. Today (Wednesday) he was brilliant,” Manjrekar said, according to <i>PTI</i>.</p>
