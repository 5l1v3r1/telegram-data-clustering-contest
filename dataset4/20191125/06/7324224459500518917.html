      <p>The Duke of York is standing back from all of the organisations of which he is a patron after the backlash which followed an interview he gave to BBC’s Newsnight programme.</p>
      <p>After the interview, Andrew faced criticism for showing a lack of empathy towards the victims of his late friend, convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>The duke was also criticised for what was seen by many as a lack of remorse over his friendship with Epstein, who took his own life in prison earlier this year while awaiting trial on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.</p>

      <p>Andrew also faces the prospect of Virginia Giuffre – an alleged Epstein victim who claims she had under-age sex with the duke, which he strenuously denies – being interviewed on BBC’s Panorama programme early in December.</p>
      <p>Actor John Challis, best known for playing Boycie in the BBC comedy series Only Fools And Horses, has defended the duke saying he should be “given a chance to actually make things better”.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Channel 5’s Jeremy Vine show the performer said: “I think the poor man’s made an awful lot of mistakes which he now regrets, do you know, obviously.</p>
      <p>“And what he’s done, retiring and so on from the public gaze, I think is exactly what should happen but I think he should be given a break because after all nothing’s been proved, has it, there is no proof.”</p>

      <p>Over the weekend, it was reported the duke had resigned from his role with his flagship business project Pitch@Palace after days of speculation about his future with the initiative he founded.</p>
      <p>High-profile business sponsors KPMG, Standard Chartered and Inmarsat, a British satellite telecommunications company, all said they would not renew their financial support for Pitch while Barclays, a partner of the project, ended its association on Friday.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman told the PA news agency: “The duke has over 230 patronages.</p>
      <p>“He will be stepping back from public duty and temporarily standing back from all his patronages.</p>

      <p>“The duke will continue to work on Pitch and will look at how he takes this forward outside of his public duties, and outside of Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>“We recognise there will be a period of time while this transition takes place.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it has been reported the Queen has cancelled a party she was to host for Andrew’s 60th birthday on February 19.</p>
      <p>There were plans for a formal reception for Andrew and the charities he was a patron of.</p>
      <p>When the Prince of Wales turned 60 in 2008, he was given a 41-gun salute in Hyde Park and a party with more than 400 guests including European royalty and members of his charity.</p>
