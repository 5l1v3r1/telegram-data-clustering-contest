      <h1>‘Soooo trashy,’ say the many hate-watching Netflix’s ‘Singapore Social’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:23:33+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Singapore" target="_blank">Coconuts Singapore</a></address>
      <p>A Singaporean reality show that premiered Saturday on Netflix is being mocked for its lack of local authenticity and other shortcomings.</p>
      <p>Viewers who have been hate-yet-can’t-stop-watching the first season of <i>Singapore Social </i>have called it out in snarky (and times hilarious) terms for featuring characters that don’t even speak with a Singaporean accent or appear way beyond privileged.</p>
      <p>“So many issues with Singapore Social but my main one is this: Why isn’t anyone talking with a Singaporean accent ???” @DarcelAnastasia <a href="https://twitter.com/DarcelAnastasia/status/1197889901879939074">tweeted</a>. </p>
      <p>“OK NO IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THOUGH WHAT IS SINGAPORE SOCIAL – I’m 15 mins in, the amount of unacknowledged privilege is off the roof – am I the only one feeling the same way about the show ?????” <a href="https://twitter.com/prostalkr/status/1198164012568965121">@Prostalkr wrote.</a></p>

      <p>The Netflix original series, one of <a href="https://coconuts.co/bangkok/lifestyle/netflixs-first-original-thai-series-gets-november-premiere/">several debuting</a> in Southeast Asia, focuses on the lives of six Singaporeans and how they try to make it in their supposedly unique career paths. They are burlesque dancer Sukki Singapora, singer Tabitha Nauser, fashion influencer Mae Tan, YouTuber Vinny Sharp, blockchain entrepreneur Nicole Ong, and television personality Paul Foster. </p>
      <p>Really representative sample, guys.</p>
      <p>Melodramatic moments include Sukki, the dancer, laying into Nicole the blockchainer for tattooing her inner lip, as if it was a socially treasonous act.</p>

      <p>The show first gained attention earlier this month when its trailer was wide panned, especially by critics calling it out for looking like a reality show version of <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i>, which centered on a wealthy Singaporean family. </p>
      <p>Some have also said that the show harks back to other popular reality shows like <i>The Hills</i> and another Netflix original, <i>Terrace House</i>. </p>

      <p>But it hasn’t been all bad reviews. Despite the many cringe-worthy things people have pointed out, many say they can’t stop watching it. </p>
      <p>“I was going to go to the gym, but here we are…. episode 7,” <a href="https://twitter.com/sameersadhu/status/1198738453950685185">@SameerSadhu</a> wrote.</p>
      <p>“Wow. Singapore Social is bad. Really really bad. So bad that everyone in Singapore should watch,” <a href="https://twitter.com/dk/status/1198097293053837312">@Dk</a> wrote. </p>
