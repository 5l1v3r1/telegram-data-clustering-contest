      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 25): Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation (Matrade) has identified various Malaysian products which could potentially fill in the gaps arising from the US-China trade conflict.</p>
      <p>Deputy chief executive officer Mohd Mustafa Abdul Aziz said the product categories include electrical and electronics (E&amp;E), machinery and equipment, optical and scientific products, petroleum as well as chemicals and chemical products.</p>
      <p>Mohd Mustafa said the trade war created opportunities for ASEAN countries like Malaysia.</p>
      <p>"Malaysia companies should be more proactive in navigating trade tension challenges to expand their business wisely," he said in a speech at the 2nd China- Malaysia 'Belt &amp; Road' Shaanxi Trade expo here, today.</p>
      <p>He said the Belt &amp; Road Initiative (BRI) presented opportunities for the Malaysian business community to tap into smart partnerships, collaborations and joint ventures, among others.</p>
      <p>"The initiative is extremely beneficial, not only for Malaysia and China, but also other countries along the BRI, especially in outbound capital projects and infrastructure.</p>
      <p>"Companies from Shaanxi could forge a win-win partnership in many areas such as supply equipment, technology, engineering, procurement and construction," he said.</p>
      <p>Mohd Mustafa said Malaysian companies are open to form strategic partnerships with Chinese companies to jointly undertake projects in Malaysia, China and countries along the BRI.</p>
      <p>He said Malaysian companies should also use Shaanxi as a gateway to northwestern China, adding that it is the most populated and developed province in the region.</p>
      <p>"There are areas with opportunities that we can collaborate on, such as aerospace parts and components, E&amp;E, commodities like palm oil, rubber and timber, consumer products as well as services including healthcare, education, retailing and franchising," he said.</p>
      <p>He added that Shaanxi can also serve as a springboard for Malaysian halal exporters to tap into the 400,000 Muslim population in western China.</p>
      <p>From January to September 2019, trade with China stood at US$55.36 billion (US$1 = RM4.18), with exports at US$24.13 billion and imports at US$31.23 billion.</p>
      <p>"China was the biggest contributor of approved foreign investments into the manufacturing sector last year at US$4.8 billion," he said, adding that in 2018, the total trade value between Malaysia and China reached a historic high at US$108.6 billion.</p>
      <p>"Moreover, 2019 is a special year as it marks the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Malaysia and China," he noted.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, China Council for the Promotion of International Trade Shaanxi Sub-Council vice-chairman Wu Fu Jie said he hoped Malaysia businesses will be able to take this opportunity to enter Shaanxi, in order to enhance Malaysia-China friendship with the expo.</p>
