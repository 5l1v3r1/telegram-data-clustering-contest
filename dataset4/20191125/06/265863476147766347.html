      <h1>Kim Kardashian Empathizes With Prince Harry And Meghan Markle Over Intense Media Scrutiny</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:08:42+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:08</time> by <a rel="author">Rachelle Lewis</a></address>
      <p>Kim Kardashian West empathizes with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle over the intense media scrutiny the royal couple faces daily.</p>
      <p>The reality TV star spoke with the Australian outlet<i> The Sunday Project</i> regarding the subject of media scrutiny. Kardashian was asked how she felt about the way the British press was treating The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.</p>
      <p>“I think everyone has their own journey. I think their journey is extremely personal, with you know, what his mother experienced and how her life was so affected by the spotlight and by paparazzi,” the KKW Beauty mogul expressed.</p>
      <p>Prince Harry recently released a statement regarding the media continuously hounding his wife, comparing it to the way his late mother, Princess Diana was treated. Markle is also fighting back against those vicious tabloid rumors. The couple has filed a lawsuit against one U.K newspaper.</p>

      <p>The negative media attention is something Kardashian knows well. She too often finds herself being scrutinized by the media. It is one of the reasons she empathizes with the royal couple.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think anyone can really understand what that’s like except for them. But I think as I’m older and as I have kids, what I would want for them is just the safest place. I can definitely empathize with their need for having a secure, safe place and taking time for themselves and having privacy when they need it,” the mother of four shared.</p>
      <p>Megan and Harry will be taking the much-needed private time Kardashian is talking about, as they end the year focusing on their family. The Palace announced the couple will be taking a sabbatical from their royal duties around the holidays.</p>

      <p>It has been reported they would be <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-reportedly-bringing-baby-archie-to-u-s-during-family-time-off-332516/">spending Thanksgiving in the United States with her mom, Doria Ragland</a> but nothing was confirmed. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be skipping Christmas with the royal family to spend it with Meghan’s mom. The Palace did not reveal if the holiday would be spent at their Frogmore Cottage home or elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Kim Kardashian West knows a little something about being crucified by the media. She has expressed that she sympathizes with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle for the awful way the tabloids are treating them.</p>
      <p>Markle knew she would be in the public eye when she married Prince Harry. Kardashian wanted to be a celebrity and live her life in the spotlight. However, does that mean they deserve the scrutiny that plagues them?</p>
