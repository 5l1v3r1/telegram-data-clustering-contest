      <p>With the richest prize in women's golf history riding on the outcome, Sei Young Kim delivered the ultimate money putt. Even if she didn't even know the score.</p>
      <p>Kim was tied for the lead going to the final hole Sunday at the CME Group Tour Championship in Naples, Florida. The nerves were obvious as she missed each of four straight putts from 12 feet or closer.</p>
      <p>Moments later, the 26-year-old South Korean took her place in LPGA Tour history.</p>
      <p>Kim made the putt of her life, a 25-footer for birdie that broke sharply to the right and into the cup for a 2-under 70, a one-shot victory over hard-charging Charley Hull and a $1.5 million payoff.</p>
      <p>"It means a lot to me just knowing that I won the biggest purse in women's golf history," said Kim, whose wire-to-wire win was her third of the year. "That itself is an incredible honor."</p>
      <p><b>PGA:</b> Tyler Duncan made a 12-foot putt on the second hole of a playoff with Webb Simpson on Sunday in the RSM Classic at St. Simons Island, Georgia, for his first PGA Tour title.</p>
      <p>Playing two groups ahead of Simpson in windy conditions on Sea Island's Seaside Course, Duncan birdied three of the last four holes in regulation for a 5-under 65. He two-putted the par-5 15h for a birdie, made a 6-footer on the par-3 17th and a 25-footer on the par-4 18th.</p>
      <p>Simpson birdied 15 and 16 and closed with two pars, making a 5-footer on 18 to match Duncan at 19-under 263 and force a playoff.</p>
      <p><b>EUROPEAN TOUR:</b> Jon Rahm is $5 million richer after capturing the Race to Dubai title on the European Tour on Sunday by winning the season-ending World Tour Championship with a birdie on the final hole.</p>
      <p>The world No. 5 got up and down from a greenside bunker at the 18th hole to win the tournament by a stroke from Tommy Fleetwood.</p>

        <b>Baylor downs Villanova to win tournament</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jared Butler scored 10 of his 22 points during the final 6 minutes, helping No. 24 Baylor pull away for an 87-78 victory over No. 17 Villanova on Sunday night and win the Myrtle Beach Invitational in Conway, South Carolina.</p>
      <p>MaCio Teague scored 18 points while Davion Mitchell added 13 to help the Bears (5-1) pass their first Top 25 test, a matchup that for much of the way felt like a potential Sweet 16 preview. Butler was named MVP of the tournament.</p>
      <p><b>NO. 12 TEXAS TECH 96, LONG-ISLAND BROOKLYN 66:</b> Freshman Jahmi'us Ramsey scored a career-high 27 points with a game-high five 3-pointers for the Red Raiders.</p>

        <b>Nadal leads Spain to Davis Cup crown</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rafael Nadal gave all he had on the Caja Magica center court in Madrid.</p>
      <p>The top-ranked Spanish star even admitted he risked getting injured by playing eight matches five singles, three doubles in six days at the Davis Cup Finals, the new World Cup of men's team tennis.</p>
      <p>Nadal won all his matches, leading Spain to its sixth Davis Cup title after a 2-0 win over first-time finalist Canada on Sunday.</p>
      <p>But in Nadal's eyes, the only hero for Spain was grieving teammate Roberto Bautista Agut. He sent Spain on its way to victory by winning the first singles match on Sunday, three days after the death of his father.</p>
