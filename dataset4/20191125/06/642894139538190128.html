      <h1>New CompTIA report tracks SA teenagers’ thoughts on technology usage and career</h1>
      <h2>The report reveals 57% of teens say they would consider a career in tech, but perceived barriers and lack of career information persist.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:36:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:36</time> by <a rel="author">CompTIA</a></address>
      <p>New research published by <a href="https://www.comptia.org/">CompTIA</a>, the leading trade association for the global technology industry, finds that teenagers in South Africa believe technology is generally moving in a positive direction and is a force for good that will play an even greater role in their lives as they grow older.</p>
      <p>The CompTIA report: “<a href="https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/docs/default-source/research-reports/comptia-international-youth-technology-and-career-perceptions.pdf?sfvrsn=f0dfb41e_2">International Youth Perspectives of Technology and Careers</a>” reveals that 57% of the South African teenagers surveyed would consider a career in technology, compared to 50% globally. South African teens are generally positive about what a job in tech entails – solving problems, doing work that’s interesting and fun and earning a good salary.</p>
      <p>But the survey also finds that barriers are still in place that may be keeping even more young people from looking at the technology field as a profession. More than 1 500 teenagers between the ages of 13 and 18 from 11 different countries [1] participated in the online survey.</p>
      <p>“It’s encouraging to see that a sizeable percentage of young people see tech as a viable career option,” said Loraine Vorster, vice-president for business development at CompTIA. “But it’s also quite apparent that we still have work to do to correct misperceptions about tech occupations and to provide career instruction and resources that reflect the reality of the 21 century tech workforce.”</p>
      <p>For example, the data shows that 32% of South African teenagers feel there are few available technology job opportunities in their local areas. Also, 31% cite a lack of affordable schooling and training options.</p>
      <p>The report also confirms gender bias is still present when it comes to career advice. Boys in South Africa receive higher levels of encouragement from parents, teachers, peers and others to consider a career in tech than girls (68% vs 45%).</p>
      <p>When teens were asked about specific career opportunities in tech, the most popular choices are designing video games, designing apps for smartphones, running a tech business and using technology to solve problems in healthcare and education.</p>
      <p>“These are all great career choices, but there are many more job roles in tech that provide the opportunity to earn a good salary, take on new and greater responsibilities and, most importantly, have a positive impact on society,” Vorster said. “We need to expand our outreach to get that message out to the next generations of workers.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Interacting with technology</b>
      </p>
      <p>Among South African teenagers, 61% generally believe technology is heading in a positive direction compared to 11% who feel that tech is heading in a negative direction, and 28% who are unsure. The corresponding global figures are 54% positive, 11% negative and 35% unsure.</p>
      <p>Factors contributing to the positive feelings include the expectation that technology will continue to get faster, better and more feature rich. Teens also view innovation and technology breakthroughs as a way to further improve lives and will provide more choices, offering something to meet the needs of almost every user.</p>
      <p>Nearly 70% of young people in South Africa report seeing or hearing something about automating technologies and the future of work. They also expressed a degree of concern over the uncertainty of automation.</p>
      <p>“Teens astutely anticipate the need for more training and hands-on experience in various technology disciplines to ensure that they are well positioned for the workplace of tomorrow,” said Anna Matthai, senior manager, research and market intelligence, CompTIA.</p>
