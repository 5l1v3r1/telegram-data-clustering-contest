      <h1>Very Ex-Pollie David Leyonhjelm Cops $120,000 Whack For Defaming Greens Senator</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:24:11+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:24</time> by <a rel="author">By Cam Tyeson</a></address>
      <p><b>David Leyonhjelm</b>, the one-time Liberal Democrats Federal Senator who voluntarily quit his post in January to launch a bid for the NSW Legislative Council only to cop a fuckin’ trouncing on election day, has been ordered to pay current Federal Greens senator <b>Sarah Hanson-Young </b>$120,000 in damages after a Federal Court ruled their on-going defamation case in Hanson-Young’s favour.</p>
      <p>Hanson-Young sued Leyonhjelm for defamation over comments he made to the media last year over a series of heated Senate debates on violence against women, during which Leyonhjelm heckled Hanson-Young that she should “stop shagging men.”</p>
      <p>That comment, due to it being made on the floor of Parliament, was protected by Parliamentary Privilege. However comments Leyonhjelm made on <i>7:30</i>, Sky News, and 3AW afterwards became the subject of the defamation proceedings.</p>

      <p>In those appearances, Leyonhjelm asserted Hanson-Young had said “all men are rapists,” and called her a hypocrite for stating that and yet still sleeping with men. He also claimed that Hanson-Young was a “misandrist.”</p>
      <p>Hanson-Young steadfastly denied ever saying this, and the court today ruled that Leyonhjelm’s statements did not have any established basis of truth.</p>
      <p>Leyonhjelm and his lawyers had attempted to claim the case was a breach of Parliamentary Privilege owing to the courts having to assess Hanson-Young’s remarks made on the senate floor, but that defence was dismissed.</p>
      <p>Leyonhjelm will also have to pay interest on top of $120,000 in damages awarded to Hanson-Young, as well as legal costs. Those figures are yet to be calculated, but will make the final payout a fairly hefty one.</p>
      <p>And to all that, you can only say: Ahh well my dude.</p>
