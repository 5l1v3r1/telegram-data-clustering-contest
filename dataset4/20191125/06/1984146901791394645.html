      <p>Newcastle United were keeping tabs on Brazilian ace Gabriel Barbosa before his sensational two-goal blast in the Copa Libertadores final on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>South American sources have indicated that the Magpies are one of the Premier League sides to run the rule over the Inter Milan player.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old's late double for Flamengo, with his strikes winning the trophy for his club on 89 and 90 minutes, were witnessed by a live TV audience in the UK after BBC Two presented a package for the big game in Lima against River Plate.</p>
      <p>At 23, Barbosa has been branded a flop by the Italian media after scoring just once in Serie A in the 2016/17 season following a €29.5million move from Santos.</p>

      </p>
      <p>He has since been loaned out to Benfica, his old club Santos and now Flamengo but he is due to return to Inter in January.</p>
      <p>But Antonio Conte's side are ready to cash in on the Brazil international with a fee of £20million mooted in recent times.</p>
      <p>United's interest only goes as far as scouting missions so far but Barbosa will be offered to a clutch of European clubs in the window in January.</p>

      <p>Crystal Palace have been credited with interest in recent days but while Newcastle's priorities lie elsewhere in the next window, Steve Bruce is mindful of the fact that he only has Dwight Gayle and Yoshinori Muto as cover for Joelinton.</p>
      <p>Andy Carroll is getting closer to full fitness but is yet to start a game as he feels his way back into the picture on Tyneside after long-term injury.</p>
      <p>When asked about his future this week Barbosa, speaking to German newspaper Bild after being linked with Bundesliga clubs this season, said: "I'm sure I'll have enough time to think about the future when our season is over."</p>
      <p>Speaking about his move to Inter and what went wrong, Barbosa added:"There were big expectations when I arrived.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, the result was not what I had in mind.</p>
      <p>"I did not get much playing time. But I still have a lot of respect for Inter and especially the fans. "</p>
