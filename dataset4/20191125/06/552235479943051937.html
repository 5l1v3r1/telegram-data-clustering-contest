      <h1>The Celtic and Rangers exits far more terrifying than any big money transfer departure - Keith Jackson</h1>
      <h2>Keith reckons Peter Lawwell and Dave King will be fully aware of the trigger fingers getting itchy in the English Premier League.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>So what exactly is it going to take to break this deadlock at the top of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a>?</p>
      <p>That <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> have both harvested a huge haul of 34 points from the first 39 available to them doesn’t just point to the size of the gulf between them and the rest.</p>
      <p>It suggests this tit-for-tat stalemate could continue for some considerable time, assuming that is nothing happens in the meantime to materially affect the destiny of this year’s title.</p>
      <p>Something unforeseen and almost certainly completely unsolicited.</p>
      <p>It could come in the shape of a funny money offer for the headline acts, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/odsonne-edouard">Odsonne Edouard</a> and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a>.</p>
      <p>Or perhaps they’ll be blind-sided by offers for other key men such as Ryan Christie, James Forrest, Ryan Jack or Ryan Kent, who offered a glimpse or two yesterday of why Rangers were willing to part with £7million for him. The loss of any of those players might throw a spanner into the works.</p>

      <p>But there is another potential danger to these sides which is a lot less obvious but every bit as significant. Maybe more.</p>
      <p>That’s why Peter Lawwell and Dave King should hold their respective managers close this Christmas and let them know just how cherished and needed they are.</p>
      <p>It can’t have escaped their notice that across the border the trigger fingers are getting itchy already before winter’s even properly set in.</p>
      <p>Put it this way, when Spurs fired the first bullet at Mauricio Pochettino last week the bang should have echoed all the way up to Glasgow because the work being carried out by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> has to be creating ripples outside of Scottish football’s goldfish bowl.</p>
      <p>Gerrard’s profile as a player alone will guarantee that soon his name will become part of the conversation when one of these plum Premier League jobs becomes vacant – and there could be a few coming up over the next few weeks and months.</p>

      <p>But he is now delivering some substantial results as a manager in his own right.</p>
      <p>Neck and neck with Celtic at the top of the table and this week heading to Feyenoord with the aim of qualifying for the knockout stages of the Europa League in only his second season in the role.</p>
      <p>It really is a highly impressive CV that Gerrard is writing for himself at Ibrox.</p>
      <p>And his credentials are being underpinned by the manner in which Frank Lampard has settled into his role at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>Lampard is coping more than comfortably with life in the fast lane at Chelsea after first cutting his teeth at Derby last season, at the same time as his old England team-mate took on the almighty task of rebuilding Rangers.</p>
      <p>It stands to reason then that Gerrard will come into that same category.</p>

      <p>And with a number of managers now feeling some serious heat down south it’s not too much of a stretch to imagine his name will feature fairly highly on at least one or two lists of possible candidates.</p>
      <p>If so it’s hard to imagine why Lennon too would not come into the discussion even if he was overlooked by everyone but Bolton when he previously stepped away from the home dugout at Celtic Park.</p>
      <p>That didn’t work out the way either party had wished it might.</p>
      <p>But, if anything, Lennon has added a great deal to the body of evidence piling up at his back.</p>
      <p>His work at Hibs was impressive if not quite earth shattering enough to raise much interest down south.</p>
      <p>But what Lennon is achieving back in Glasgow’s east end is another matter entirely. When he took Lazio’s scalp in Rome earlier this month he elevated himself on to a different managerial level.</p>

      <p>Statement victories like that – and that famous Champions League win over Barcelona – do not come around by accident.</p>
      <p>So would it really be a surprise if, for example, the likes of a Leicester were paying some attention to what their former player is doing at Celtic.</p>
      <p>They certainly ought to be assessing their options because Brendan Rodgers looks destined for bigger and better things than the King Power Stadium given the spectacular success he’s been making of things there this season.</p>
      <p>That Leicester are sitting in second place, above Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City, points a manager who is going places all over again.</p>
      <p>It could have been Spurs if the rumours are to be believed he was up there with Jose Mourinho on Daniel Levy’s original wanted list.</p>
      <p>And, unless Unai Emery gets the finger out at Arsenal, there could soon be another opportunity with his name all over it. So, yes, Leicester would be guilty of mismanagement were they not drawing up some kind of Plan B and, given the job Lennon has done of filling Rodgers’ shoes at Celtic, it’d make little sense were he not at least a person of interest.</p>

      <p>Of course, there’s absolutely nothing to suggest that either Lennon or Gerrard would wish to disengage from this season’s utterly compelling title fight that cranked up another notch over the weekend with wins for both sides.</p>
      <p>Yes, Hamilton made it a hard Sunday shift for Rangers but once more Gerrard’s judgment was vindicated by the couple of moments of multimillion pound magnificence by Kent.</p>
      <p>That will have doubtless pleased chairman King who is in town for this week’s AGM and got the chance to see in person what kind of bang he’s getting for his bucks where his most expensive signing is concerned.</p>
      <p>Yet the more Gerrard and Lennon get it right the more the men upstairs might soon have significant reason to worry.</p>
