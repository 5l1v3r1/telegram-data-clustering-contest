      <p>The miDiagnostics device can perform a complete cell blood count (CBC) from only drops of blood</p>
      <p>Imec will design test parameters and perform experiments in different gravity scenarios using one of miDiagnostics’ devices that is built around a silicon-based nanofluidic processor that performs a series of blood sample manipulations yielding a cell blood count with fast turnaround time.</p>
      <p>Imec  will test the device in parabolic flight, which offers different gravitational loads. This specific environment will allow testing of the functionality of the nanofluidic system and its independence from gravity—from sample capture at the inlet port to its migration within the nanofluidic channel network.</p>
