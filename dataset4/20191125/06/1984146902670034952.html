      <h2>The old Marley Hill primary school is going to be redeveloped as part of a £1.2m scheme</h2>

      <p>Work is under way on a £1.2m scheme to regenerate the site of a former <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead">Gateshead</a> school.</p>
      <p>The work includes the redevelopment of the former 4,000 sq ft<a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/marley-hill-primary-school-closes-1424022"> Marley Hill Primary School </a>house on the A692 outside Sunniside, which has been vacant for almost a decade.</p>
      <p>The plans will see the old school buildings converted into two luxury residential homes as part of wider multi-million pound redevelopment of the entire site, including the former playground area.</p>
      <p>A number of two, three and four-bedroomed properties have recently been completed on land to the rear of the school building, while plans for the former Victorian era classrooms are being transformed into modern living accommodation while retaining some of the existing internal finishes.</p>
      <p>The two five-bedroomed homes, which are expected to be worth in excess of £600,000 each when finished in 2020, are being designed and project managed by Newcastle architectural technologists and design firm, Ergo Projects.</p>
      <p>The move is part of plans by the firm to reinvigorate the former school after it closed its gates in 2010 as a result of the borough's bid to cut surplus primary school places.</p>
      <p>Adrian Reay, managing director of Ergo Projects, said redevelopment ushers in a new phase in the site’s long history.</p>
      <p>He said: “As architectural technologists, you always want to work on challenging projects and for clients with ambition.</p>
      <p>"Working with Camfero Homes, we have designed a highly creative development that both respects the site’s heritage and provides an outstanding vision of modern living.</p>
      <p>“On the back of a growing client base and an impressive portfolio of work, we are going from strength-to-strength. The opportunity to work for high-profile individuals is always one that we would welcome as a creatively-driven design office.”</p>
