        <b>ETF Overview</b>
      </p>
      <p>iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IHI">IHI</a>) owns a portfolio of large-cap medical devices stocks. The ETF is a nice defensive choice as demands for healthcare devices are less impacted in an economic recession. Stocks in IHI’s portfolio should benefit from an ageing population in the world. In addition, the advancement of technology and the implementation of AI should bring significant growth in the industry. Despite a long runway of growth ahead, most stocks in IHI’s portfolio are currently overvalued. Therefore, investors may want to wait on the sidelines until a better entry point.</p>

      <p>Stocks in IHI’s portfolio should benefit from an ageing population in the world. According to a report by the United Nation, the number of people aged 60 years or older will double by 2050 from the current level today (see chart below). This presents tremendous opportunities for stocks in IHI’s portfolio to grow their businesses.</p>

      <p>Medical devices industry is a good defensive choice, especially during an economic downturn, because demand for medical devices is less impacted in an economic recession. Therefore, IHI’s portfolio of stocks is a nice investment choice, especially during periods of economic uncertainties. In addition, stocks in IHI’s portfolio are stocks with competitive positions over their smaller peers. As can be seen from the chart below, all of the top 10 holdings in IHI’s portfolio receive either narrow or wide moat status, according to Morningstar’s research. These top 10 stocks represent 71% of IHI’s portfolio.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The advancement of technology will continue to bring transformation to the entire medical devices industry in the next few decades. Stocks in IHI’s portfolio will benefit from the popularity of Internet of Things. In fact, Markets and Markets <a href="http://www.sbwire.com/press-releases/iot-healthcare-market-worth-15807-billion-usd-by-2022-1035689.htm">anticipates</a> that the healthcare IoT market will be worth $158.07 billion by 2022 (a growth rate of 30.8% annually). Besides growth in healthcare IoT market, artificial intelligence is also poised to lead to <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/features/artificial-intelligence-promises-a-new-paradigm-for-healthcare">significant</a> growth in the healthcare industry. Medical equipment with AI capabilities can be used to detect many diseases quickly. Therefore, we see a long runway of growth for stocks in IHI’s portfolio.</p>

      </p>
      <p>While we like the growth outlook of stocks in IHI’s portfolio, its portfolio of stocks is expensive. As can be seen from the table below, the average P/E ratio of IHI’s stocks is 26.72x. This is significantly higher than the S&amp;P 500 Index. Its price to cash flow ratio of 13.70x is also considerably higher than the S&amp;P 500 Index. Even though it has higher valuation, IHI’s average sales growth rate of 6.61% is lower than the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 7.06%.</p>

      <p>Let us now take a look at the top 10 holdings of IHI’s portfolio. As can be seen from the table, 9 out of 10 stocks in its top 10 holdings have higher forward P/E ratios than their own 5-year average forward P/E ratios. The weighted-average forward P/E ratio of IHI’s top 10 holdings is 24.70x. This is higher than their 5-year weighted-average P/E ratio of 21.51x. Therefore, we think IHI is currently overvalued.</p>

        <b>Risks and Challenges</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Currency risks</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Since many stocks in IHI’s portfolio have sizable businesses internationally, these stocks’ revenues and profits can also be impacted by foreign exchange rates.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Medical devices industry can be highly competitive</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Companies in IHI’s portfolio may face competition from new entrants. Many consumer electronics companies are trying to enter this space because gross margins of medical devices are generally much higher than gross margins of consumer electronics.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Investor Takeaway</b>
      </p>
      <p>Although we see a long runway of growth for stocks in IHI’s portfolio, thanks to technology advancements and an ageing population in the world, we recognize that most stocks in IHI’s portfolio are currently overvalued. Therefore, we believe investors may want to wait for a pullback before initiating a position.</p>
