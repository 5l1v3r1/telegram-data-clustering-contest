      <p>ZERA said the new prices were premised on the interbank market rate and will see a litre of blend petrol (E20) retailing at $17,44 while diesel will sell at $17,90 per litre.</p>
      <p>Last week, the price of petrol was pegged at $17,07 while diesel was at $17,74 per litre.</p>
      <p>The price changes are due to the FOB (Free on Board) price movement and the revised duty regime.</p>
