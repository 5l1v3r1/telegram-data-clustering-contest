      <p>Luka Doncic scored 41 points, Tim Hardaway Jr. added a season-high 31 and the Dallas Mavericks never trailed in a 137-123 victory over the Houston Rockets on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Mavericks scored 45 points in the first quarter and were up 78-60 at halftime. Hardaway had 19 in the half, Doncic 17 and Kristaps Porzingis 15.</p>
      <p>The Mavericks have won five straight, scoring at least 137 in the last three. Houston has lost three straight after winning eight in a row.</p>
      <p><b>KINGS 113, WIZARDS 106:</b> Harrison Barnes matched his season high with 26 points on 7-of-8 shooting and Bojan Bogdanovic had 21 points for Sacramento.</p>
      <p>Buddy Hield added 18 points, including a late 3-pointer that put Sacramento's lead at multiple possessions for good, and Richaun Holmes had 16 points and 10 rebounds. The Kings won for the seventh time in 10 games to improve to 7-8.</p>
      <p><b>NUGGETS 116, SUNS 104:</b> Paul Millsap scored 23 points and Jamal Murray and Will Barton each had 22 to help Denver win its fifth straight.</p>
      <p>Nikola Jokic had just eight points, but grabbed 13 rebounds. The Nuggets held Phoenix guard Devin Booker to a season-low 12 points on 5-of-13 shooting. Booker came in averaging 26.2 points in November.</p>
      <p>Cheick Diallo led Phoenix with a career-high 22 points. Dario Saric had a career-high 17 rebounds to go with 18 points.</p>
      <p><b>NETS 103, KNICKS 101:</b> Spencer Dinwiddie scored 30 points in another strong start in place of the injured Kyrie Irving and Brooklyn beat New York for its season-high third straight victory.</p>
      <p>Irving continues to rest an injured right shoulder, and Dinwiddie is making sure they get by without him, scoring 20 or more points in a career-best five straight games after stepping into the starting lineup.</p>
      <p>He was 13 of 14 from the foul line, where the Nets had a whopping 27-9 advantage in makes.</p>
