      <p>Kwame Asare Obeng alias A Plus   has called out President  Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo for failing  to condemn his attack dogs  who insult his critics with all sort of names including ‘useless Ashawos’ alleging  that the President’s silence amounts to supporting the actions.</p>
      <p>A Plus who until recently is a known NPP member, has detailed how he tirelessly defended the integrity of the President when he was a presidential candidate and faced myriad choice insults from his opponents. He however is disappointed that the President seems to endorse the raining of insults on critics of the NPP.</p>
      <p>“They said Nana Addo is a wee smoker, we said he is not. We defended him because yes, he is not. They said Nana  sniffs cocaine, we said no he does not. It’s just lies. They said Nana Addo killed his wife, we said no!!! He will never do such a thing. He is a good man. They said Nana Addo is arrogant. We said no!!! He is confident. We spent close to 10 years defending him till he became president. Today, when you simply ask what he has done as president, he sends his people to insult you and call women ashawo. Yes it’s Nana. He hears everything. He has not condemned it. He is enjoying it. He supports it. Those who do that are his heroes. Very disappointing!!! This president is not my Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo Addo, the world class diplomat I knew in 07/08,” he wrote on social media Friday sighted by MyNewsGh.com.</p>
      <p>His comments come on the back of insults that have been rained on many critics of the NPP, especially broadcast journalist Nana Aba Anamoah after she criticised the NPP for constantly comparing its record  with the National  Democratic Congress (NDC) instead of telling Ghanaians how they are fulfilling their promises.</p>
      <p>Nana Aba after the criticism, came under attack from supporters of the governing NPP with one leading NPP member describing her as a prostitute. He would later apologize to Ms Anamoah after much criticism.</p>
      <p>The President silence on the insulting comments of his supporters, especially on the deluge of insults Ms Anamoah received, is what has led A Plus to conclude that the President is “enjoying” the actions of his offensive supporters.</p>
