      <h1>Brutal daylight bashing on packed CBD tram, man in hospital</h1>

      <p>A man has been brutally bashed in broad daylight on a packed CBD tram, raising fresh concerns about the safety of Melbourne's trams following alleged sex assaults on the same route.</p>
      <p>The man, believed to be in his late 30s or early 40s, was taken to St Vincent's Hospital in a stable condition after the attack on the 96 tram on Bourke Street about 2.20pm on Monday.</p>

      <p>A commuter on the tram said the attack began just before the Queen Street stop.</p>
      <p>"I heard this huge commotion and all these people screaming," she said. "I looked up and this man - they were sitting opposite each other - was just punching the (victim) over and over and over, with a huge amount to force.</p>
      <p>"People were screaming to stop the tram and they were trying to move away because this guy was going nuts."</p>
      <p>She said fellow commuters pulled the pair apart, but the attacker hoisted himself up using the poles and launched a vicious kick into the victim's back, sending him sprawling to the tram floor.</p>
      <p>"(The attacker) turned around and walked to the doors of the tram - it was coming to a stop - he was pressing the button and muttering. Then he got off and walked away," she said. "This guy, the victim, was dripping with blood. It was all over the platform and these two lovely people, a guy and girl, got out tissues and were helping to get the blood off."</p>
      <p>She said the victim indicated to her after the incident that he did not know the attacker.</p>
      <p>Last week police charged a man over the sexual assault of at least three women on Melbourne trams since February.</p>
      <p>Two of the alleged assaults happened on the same route as Thursday's bashing.</p>
      <p>Daniel Bowen from the Public Transport Users Association said violent attacks in broad daylight were rare and acknowledged Protective Services Officers "could not be everywhere".</p>
      <p>But he said the incident was concerning and urged authorities to consider new ways to keep commuters safe on full CBD trams. This could involve faster means of communication between tram drivers and emergency services, he said.</p>
      <p>"Once upon a time we had conductors riding around with passengers, and that's no longer the case," he said.</p>
      <p>Most efforts to curb rising crime on Melbourne's public transport have focused on the train network and night-time hours.</p>
      <p>However, Police Minister Lisa Neville announced in January that <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p50teb.html">Protective Services Officers would be deployed on tram routes with higher incidences of crime</a>.</p>
      <p>She stopped short of committing to patrols across Melbourne's entire tram network.</p>
      <p>Data from the Crime Statistics Agency released in January showed assaults on Melbourne's public transport had increased since 2016, <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p50tm6.html">with a 60 per cent rise in sexual offences alone</a>.</p>
      <p>A report from the Productivity Commission, also released in January, showed nearly a third of Victorians felt unsafe travelling on public transport at night.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Ms Neville said the government had committed to rolling out 100 additional PSOs across the public transport system.</p>
      <p>"We made changes to the legislation to enable police to deploy PSOs on all transport modes, including trams. Victoria Police have deployed PSOs on trams - particularly over summer - and will continue to deploy them based on need and intelligence," the spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>"We’re working with Victoria Police to deliver new legislation that means PSOs could be deployed even more flexibly in the community when and where they’re needed, while at the same time maintaining their current presence across the public transport network."</p>
      <p>She said the 2019 Report on Government Services showed feelings of safety on public transport increased 14.7 for daylight hours and 34.3 percent for night hours, compared to the previous year.</p>
      <p>Yarra Trams have been contacted for comment.</p>
