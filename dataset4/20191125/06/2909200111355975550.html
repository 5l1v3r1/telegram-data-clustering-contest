      <p>Founder of the International Central Gospel Church (ICGC), Pastor Mensa Otabil has stated that successful people come under attack because their success is a threat others.</p>
      <p>In a sermon themed “Defend your portion” delivered to his congregants, Pastor Otabil explained that unsuccessful people who feel threatened by the success of others prefer to pull them down rather than they striving to be successful themselves.</p>
      <p>“You get attacked because your success is a threat. For somebody who wishes your downfall, when you succeed, it diminishes their power. You threaten them… And people will prefer to pull everybody to their level instead of rising to a higher level. And so your success is a threat; it’s an annoyance to somebody else and that’s why they going to attack you. And fourthly,   people will attack you because your success will encourage others to trust God,” he said.</p>
      <p>The renowned  pastor  who is also the founder  and chancellor  of  Central University, added that  pioneers come under special  attacks because they  set a chain reaction  of successful  people, and so are usually  viciously attacked so as to stop them in the first place.</p>
      <p>“Whenever you’re the first to start anything successful, you will come under intense attack.  Whenever  you’re the first  in any endeavor…you come under special attacks  because  the adversary, Satan, would make sure he doesn’t  allow  you to start because when  you are  successful,  you will infect  others  with your success,” he explained.</p>
      <p>Pastor Otabil oversees the ICGC churches worldwide. He is also an entrepreneur, a motivational speaker and a philanthropist.</p>

        <b>Controversy</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pastor Otabil was the board chairman of defunct Capital Bank that had its license revoked for breaching banking regulations.</p>
      <p>Founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of defunct Capital Bank, William Ato Essien however revealed that his father-son relationship with Pastor Mensa Otabil did not give him the chance to misconduct himself as CEO of his now collapsed bank, stressing that Pastor Otabil “disciplined” him than anyone else.</p>
      <p>Ato Essien revealed that as Board Chairman of the now collapsed Bank, Pastor Mensa Otabil  was the one who pulled the brakes on many issues contrary to popular belief that he may have been less rigorous with him because of the very cordial relationship that exists between them, leading ultimately to the collapse of the bank.</p>
      <p>“If anybody pulled the brakes, if anybody disciplined William A to Essien, if anybody had influence to bring to bare it was Dr Otabil,” he remarked to Paul Adom-Otchere on Metro TV’s Good Evening Ghana show monitored by MyNewsGh.com a little over a month ago.</p>
