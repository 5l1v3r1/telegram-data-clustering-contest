      <h2>The Gender Matters in Ireland 2019 report said there has been a continuation of so-called lad culture.</h2>

      <p>YOUNGER PEOPLE OFTEN hold more rigid views on gender equality and roles, according to a new report from Safe Ireland. </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.safeireland.ie/more-rigid-views-on-gender-equality-and-roles-often-held-by-younger-people-new-safe-ireland-research-indicates/">Gender Matters in Ireland 2019</a> report showed that a significant number of people continue to hold traditional views of gender-based roles and responsibilities. </p>
      <p>26% of young people under 25 believe a man should be the head of a household. One-fifth of young people in this age group believe a man should drive the car for couples in heterosexual relationships. </p>
      <p>The research in the report was carried out for Safe Ireland, a government-funded agency working to end domestic abuse and coercive control.  </p>
      <p>Caitriona Gleeson, programme and communications manager with the organisation, said these results show a “need to re-think the way we are teaching” young people about respect and equality.</p>
      <p>“It also indicates that the views and actions of parents and older role-models may be reinforcing rigid views about home and societal positioning for men and women,” said Gleeson. </p>
      <p>Nearly 30% of over-65s believe that household chores like cooking and cleaning should be done by women, compared to 17% of people in general.  </p>
      <p>The report indicated that so-called lad culture continues as younger women in particular say macho behaviour is a serious and intimidating issue faced regularly in their lives.  </p>
      <p>One-third of adults from farming backgrounds believe grocery shopping is a woman’s job, while just over one-fifth of people on average believe this. </p>
      <p>In terms of attitudes towards domestic violence, 20% of men said they believe women may provoke abuse against themselves, while 16% of adults in general feel this way. </p>
      <p>Women, younger people and those from rural backgrounds are more likely to disagree with the view that men should not have to admit that their feelings are hurt. </p>
      <p>The research in the report was conducted through surveys of around 830 adults. It was used to gather modern attitudes towards gender equality, roles and responsibilities.  </p>
