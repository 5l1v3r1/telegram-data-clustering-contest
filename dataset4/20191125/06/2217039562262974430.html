        <b>Royal Caribbean International has entered into a new multi-million-dollar marketing partnership with the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) and Changi Airport Group (CAG) to promote fly-cruises.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The five-year tripartite collaboration is expected to bring some 623,000 international fly-cruise visitors to Singapore and generate more than $430 million in tourism receipts between end-2019 and 2024.</p>
      <p>The announcement of the partnership is in tandem with news of the cruise line's five-year Quantum-class deployment in Singapore, which includes Quantum of the Seas, one of Asia's largest and most revolutionary cruise ships.</p>
      <p>To kick off the partnership, Quantum of the Seas has arrived fresh from her multi-million-dollar refurbishment for her six-month homeporting season in Singapore - Royal Caribbean's longest Singapore deployment for a Quantum Class ship - which is expected to add some 150,000 overseas and local guests to the local cruising scene.</p>
