        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 25 – A 25-year-old man accused of killing a woman in Kibra slum, Nairobi was due in court Monday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He was arrested by detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) who recovered a blood-stained kitchen knife from him following the incident that occurred in Silanga area.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>The deceased was identified by police as Mwandikwa Kimwele, 33.</p>
      <p>“The deceased was found murdered at Silanga area in Kibera. A blood-stained Kitchen knife suspected to be the murder weapon recovered,” DCI said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred days after Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi termed the rising cases of violence against women, as a national security threat and called for concerted efforts to manage the situation.</p>
      <p>Matiangi said that rampant killings have “left a disjointed society living in fear and underscored the need for a candid discussion on the emotive topic.”</p>
      <p>Just last week, a military officer based at the Laikipia airbase was arrested over the murder of his estranged wife and two children believed to have been killed inside the military barracks. He is held alongside two other suspects.</p>
