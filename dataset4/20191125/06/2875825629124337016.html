      <p>Chris Blake admits returning to the AIB Leinster club final with Eire Og is like going back to the future.</p>
      <p>Attacker Blake blasted 1-4 in Portlaoise as the Carlow town outfit surged to their first provincial decider since 1998.</p>
      <p>The club won five titles in all in the 1990s and many of those players’ sons featured in Saturday’s win.</p>
      <p>Niall Quinlan, son of club and county great Willie, converted three second-half frees as Eire Og turned the screw on the seven-time champions.</p>
      <p>Ross Dunphy set the seal on a famous win with Eire Og’s second goal on the hour mark - securing their place in next Sunday week’s final.</p>

      <p>Blake said: “I grew up listening to stories about all those Leinster winning teams, players like Morrisesey, Quinlan, ‘Smoky’ Joe (Hayden), those lads were legends in the 1990s and now their sons are there; Jordan, Niall, Derek, it’s unbelievable, a great club, I love it.”</p>
      <p>The scores were tied at half-time but Eire Og outscored Portlaoise 1-6 to 0-1 after the break.</p>
      <p>Portlaoise’s only score in that period was a converted free and both Kieran Lillis and Conor Boyle were sent off in the final quarter.</p>
      <p>Eire Og hit 10 wides in total, had a 26th minute penalty saved and still won by nine points - underlining their superiority.</p>
      <p>Blake admitted they were inspired by watching Carlow hurling champions St Mullins reach their provincial final.</p>
      <p>Blake said: “St Mullins put on an absolute show. They’re a small club and I was talking to a few of their lads during the week, they just said, ‘Look, go out and die in your boots’. That’s what the St Mullins lads did and we did exactly the same.”</p>
      <p><b>Scorers - Eire Og:</b> C Blake 1-4 (0-1f), R Dunphy 1-1, N Quinlan 0-3 (0-3f), J Lowry, C Hulton, D O’Brien 0-1.</p>
      <p><b>Portlaoise:</b> K Lillis 1-1, B McCormack 0-2 (0-1f), B Carroll, G Dillon, C Boyle 0-1.</p>
