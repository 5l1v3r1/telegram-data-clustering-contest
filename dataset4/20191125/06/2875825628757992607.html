      <p>"The rain will become confined to Ulster this morning, with scattered showers elsewhere, a few of these heavy. A few patches of fog also.</p>
      <p>"Top temperatures of 9 to 12 C. Light to moderate southeast breezes will become southwesterly or variable.</p>
      <p>"A few clear spells tonight, but generally misty and cloudy, with patches of fog in places. Scattered showers at first, but wet and windy weather will develop over Munster and south Leinster later in the night.</p>
      <p>"Rain will move northwards tomorrow morning, heavy in places. Brighter, more showery weather will follow from the south.</p>
      <p>"Windy, with strong to gale force southerly winds on southern coasts and fresh to strong easterly winds elsewhere. Top temperatures of 8 to 11 C."</p>

      <p>A forecaster added: "Low pressure will make for further unsettled conditions, rather dull generally with showery spells of rain occurring most days.</p>
      <p>"However, it should become somewhat drier by Friday. Temperatures will be around normal for the first half of the week, with mostly frost free nights, but becoming colder later in the week with frosty nights returning.</p>
      <p>"Outbreaks of rain on Thursday; driest and brightest cross southern counties at first, and later across northern areas. Highs of 8 to 11 degrees, in light to moderate northwest breezes.</p>
