        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/30/who-is-jade-in-coronation-street-and-what-is-she-up-to-with-fiz-10833639/">Jade Rowan</a> (Lottie Henshall) has been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/30/who-is-jade-in-coronation-street-and-what-is-she-up-to-with-fiz-10833639/">acting suspiciously on Coronation Street</a> for weeks, and now it seems she’s finally about to put her vile plans into action.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jade arrived on the scene as a tutor for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fiz/">Fiz Stape</a>’s (Jennie McAlpine) troubled daughter Hope, and it’s been pretty clear that she’s harboured some sort of vendetta against the family from the first.</p>
      <p>In upcoming scenes, Jade will be able to convince the powers that be that Fiz and Tyrone (Alan Halsall) are unfit parents, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/coronation-street-spoilers-nanny-jade-fiz-stape-tyrone-11195109/">social services will get involved</a>.</p>
      <p>So what has Jade got against Fiz and her husband?</p>
      <h3>What is Jade’s secret in Coronation Street?</h3>
      <p>It’s not yet known exactly what grudge Jade has against Fiz and her family, but we’re set to find out this week.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Whatever it is, it’s got to be pretty big if she’s willing to stoop so low as to try getting their children taken away from them.</p>
      <p>A source has told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10388454/corries-fiz-tyrone-social-services/">The Sun</a>: ‘The couple will be completely blindsided by having their children taken off them and at a loss as to how it could have happened. But it is actually Jade that has reported them to social services for allegedly abusing Hope and Tyrone’s daughter, Ruby.</p>

      <p>‘They are taken away from the couple while an investigation into the claims is carried out. In the meantime, Fiz and Tyrone face 2020 wondering what happened to their family.’</p>
      <p>As Fiz and Tyrone try to prove their innocence, they’ll also attempt to figure out why Jade has done this to them.</p>

      <p>Jade used to be Hope’s teaching assistant in Birmingham, but Evelyn (Maureen Lipman) was suspicious from the start about the fact that Jade would be willing to drop everything to become a live-in-tutor for the girl.</p>
      <p>It turns out Evelyn was right to be concerned – will Jade ever get her comeuppance for trying to destroy Fiz’s family?</p>
      <p>Only time will tell…</p>
