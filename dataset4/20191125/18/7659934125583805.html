      <p>A Human Rights Watch (HRW) researcher complied with an Israeli expulsion order on Monday imposed over accusations he backs an international pro-Palestinian boycott, but said the edict would only encourage rights abuses.<br/><br/>HRW and Omar Shakir, a US citizen representing the New York-based organization in Israel and the Palestinian territories, have denied the allegations.<br/><br/>Three weeks ago, Israel's Supreme Court upheld the Interior Ministry's refusal to renew Shakir's work visa and ordered him to leave by Nov. 25.<br/><br/>The ministry said Shakir actively supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Israeli law allows for authorities to ban the entry of foreign citizens who call for a boycott of Israel.<br/><br/>Shakir denies that his HRW work and pro-Palestinian statements he made before being appointed to the HRW post in 2016 constitute active support for BDS.<br/><br/>"If the Israeli government can deport somebody documenting rights abuses without facing consequences, how can we ever stop rights abuses?" Shakir said at a news conference in Jerusalem on Monday before heading to the airport for his departure.<br/><br/>Israel's Ministry of Strategic Affairs, which is tasked with combating the BDS movement, welcomed Shakir's removal, calling him "an active BDS propagator".<br/><br/>"Israel, like any sane country, has the right to decide who is given the freedom to enter and work within its borders," the ministry said in a statement.<br/><br/>Shakir will continue in his role from neighboring Jordan, relying on a network of researchers in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza to conduct field work, HRW's executive director Kenneth Roth said at the news conference.<br/><br/>"There's no point in replacing Omar because our next researcher would have the same problem," Roth said.<br/><br/>Roth said Shakir was being punished in part for HRW's work calling for businesses active in Israel's settlements in the occupied West Bank to cease their activities.</p>
