      <p>AMARILLO, Texas (KFDA) - We are tracking a very strong low pressure system that will affect our region tomorrow.</p>
      <p>This system will generate some intense wind and could cause sustained winds in the 30-40 mph range with gusts over 6 0mph.</p>
      <p>A High Wind Watch has been issued as well as a Fire Weather Watch for most of our area.</p>
      <p>Loose items and decorations should be secured around your home and travel could be very dangerous for high profile vehicles.</p>
      <p>The threat for wildfires will be significant and precautions should be taken to prevent starting fires.</p>
