      <h1>After Jokowi’s ‘millennials’ team, Ma’ruf picks ‘colonial era’ expert staff</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:35:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:35</time> by <a rel="author">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>After President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo made headlines last week for appointing seven millennial-generation people to his team of aides, Vice President Ma’ruf Amin has now grabbed public attention because of his expert staff members, albeit for a very different reason.</p>
      <p>The 76-year-old Ma’ruf, a renowned Islamic figure, recently recruited eight people “from his generation” who are to help him in office, according to vice presidential spokesperson Masduki Baidlowi.</p>
      <p>Ma’ruf’s expert staff members mostly comprise individuals affiliated with the country’s largest Muslim organization, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), of which he himself is a senior figure.</p>
      <p>The members included Indonesian Ulema Council Food and Drug Analysis Agency director Lukmanul Hakim, NU chairmen Muhammad Imam Aziz and Robikin Emhas, Masduki himself — who is also an NU member — and Islamic State University professor Masykuri Abdillah. </p>
      <p>Others included legal expert Satya Arinanto, former research, technology and higher education minister Mohamad Nasir and a former member of the Agriculture Ministry’s expert staff, Sukriansyah S. Latief. </p>
      <p>Ma’ruf, who is also a non-active chairman of MUI, previously served as Rais Aam (supreme leader) of NU.</p>
      <p>“I thought that because the President has already recruited millennials, it was only fitting that <i>kiai </i>[Ma’ruf] should recruit people from his era – the colonial era,” Masduki said in jest on Monday, as quoted by <i>kompas.com</i>. “But it doesn’t detract from the fact that [the appointees] are competent and skilled.”</p>
      <p>He added that, above all else, the most important aspect of an expert staff member was competence.</p>
      <p>“Whether they’re of the millennial or the colonial generation, I think they’re pretty much the same,” Masduki said. </p>
      <p>He said that Jokowi did not intervene in the selection of Ma’ruf’s expert staff members as the President had recognized the Vice President's prerogative right to make his own choices. </p>
      <p>The vice presidential expert staff members had started their duties on Monday. They and Ma’ruf had agreed to convene for meetings every Sunday to discuss strategic issues, Masduki added.</p>
      <p>Jokowi announced his 12 presidential expert staff members on Thursday, seven of whom were millennials with ages ranging from 23 to 36 years old. (rfa)</p>
