      <h1>Yahoo Fantasy Football Picks Week 13: NFL DFS lineup advice for cash games</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:38:19+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:38</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Lutovsky</a></address>
      <p>Well,last week's<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/yahoo-fantasy-football-picks-week-12-nfl-dfs-lineup-advice-daily-cash-games/o8bn8v9f30rh1lwohptvc8gkk">Yahoo DFS cash lineup</a>didn't turn out well, now did it? It started when Matt Ryan failed to throw a TD against the worst pass defense in the NFL, and it continued through David Montgomery's and Jamison Crowder's duds. Chris Godwin and Nick Chubb came through (and the Redskins D/ST, DeVante Parker, and Le'Veon Bell weren't terrible), but clearly the memo didn't get to all of our players. It happens. We'll regroup and do better with ourWeek 13daily fantasy football cash lineup picks.</p>
      <p>This week's lineup will need to be carried by Patrick Mahomes and Christian McCaffrey. Assuming they can produce as they normally do and the rest of our players come close to hitting their floors, we should cash, but we still have to take some calculated risks. The biggest risk might be a RB/WR stack that doesn't normally correlate, but in cash games, you can make that move if the matchups/prices allow for it. A combined $34 for two players facing the Dolphins qualifies.</p>

      <p>Our D/ST is also a bit of a gamble, especially since it's up against one of our stars. But, again, we're getting it at a good price that allows for other studs who have a better chance of carrying us past the cash line.</p>
      <h3>Week 13 Yahoo NFL DFS Lineup: Picks, Advice for cash games</h3>
      <p><b>QB: Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs vs. Raiders ($38). </b>When these teams played in Week 2, Mahomes had four touchdown passes...in the second quarter. Even if Tyreek Hill (hamstring) is out (like he was in Week 2), Mahomes still has more upside than any QB on this slate, which is why we're willing to pay QB1 price for him. Lamar Jackson is a little more interesting in GPPs, as he might be faded because of the matchup against the Niners, but in cash, Mahomes is our guy.</p>
      <p><b>RB: Christian McCaffrey, Panthers vs. Redskins ($42). </b>The price is silly, but we don't like the cheaper backs as much this week. As such, we're willing to pay $9 more than any other RB for Mr. Automatic, who gets the added advantage of facing a Redskins defense allowing the ninth-most fantasy points per game (FPPG) to RBs.</p>
      <p><b>RB: Miles Sanders, Eagles @ Dolphins ($16). </b>In order to afford Mahomes and McCaffrey, we need to look for values, and Sanders fits the bill. Even if Jordan Howard (shoulder) is back and getting the bulk of the carries, Sanders should see 10-plus touches. In the last game in which Sanders and Howard played together, Howard had 20 touches and Sanders had 13. Against the Dolphins, who allow 23 FPPG to RBs (tied for fourth most), both backs can produce, and Sanders is the slightly better value at $2 cheaper than Howard. If Howard is out again, Sanders will be a chalk play.</p>
      <p><b>WR: Julian Edelman, Patriots @ Texans ($22). </b>Edelman has had double-digit targets in each of the past six games, and Houston allows 23.8FPPG to WRs (12th most). With injuries limiting New England's receivers, Edelman is the one player Tom Brady knows he can count on. In this matchup, he'll count on him often, making Edelman the perfect cash game option at a relatively affordable $22.</p>
      <p><b>WR: DeVante Parker, Dolphins vs. Eagles ($18). </b>The Eagles have tightened up against WRs lately, but they still allow the fourth-most FPPG to the position. Parker continues to have a high floor,receiving double-digit targets in each of the past three games. Yahoo keeps upping his price slightly, but he still checks in as a value in this favorable matchup.</p>
      <p><b>WR: Alshon Jeffery, Eagles @ Dolphins ($18). </b>Jeffery (ankle) has missed the past couple games, but he was a surprise scratch last week, so we expect him to be ready for this matchup. Miami allows just under 26 FPPG to WRs (fifth most), and while Jeffery has been limited in tough matchups this year, he's mostly taken advantage of favorable ones, scoring against Washington and Minnesota. He's also one of just seven WRs to score against the Packers. His price is depressed because of injury and prior disappointing performances in brutal matchups (Cowboys, Bills, Bears) leading up to that, so take advantage.</p>
      <p><b>TE: Gerald Everett, Rams @ Cardinals ($18). </b>The Cardinals continue to bethe worst team at covering TEs by a significant margin, allowing at least one TE touchdown in every game but one (assuming you count Taysom Hill as a TE). Either way, regardless of Everett's recent struggles, he's a must-play in this game, and getting him at TE8 pricing is worth the risk.</p>

        <b>MORE WEEK 13 DFS: <a href="http://rotoql.com/sportingnews">Lineup Builder</a></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>FLEX: Damien Williams, Chiefs vs. Raiders ($17). </b>We'll have to make sure Williams (ribs) is active after exiting Kansas City's last game early, but he had become locked in as the Chiefs' primary RB, receiving 24 touches in Week 9. The Raiders allow a healthy 19.1 FPPG to RBs, which includes 542 RB receiving yards (seventh most) and five RB receiving TDs (tied for second most). Williams can do damage as a runner and receiver with around 15 touches, giving him a solid floor at a nice price.</p>
      <p><b>D/ST: Redskins @ Panthers ($11). </b>We rode the Redskins to a solid showing last week, and while we're hesitant to do it again -- especially with Christian McCaffrey also in our lineup -- we just don't like most of the other choices this week, at least relative to their prices. This is another situation where we have to sacrifice a bit to fit in Mahomes and McCaffrey, so we'll bank on Kyle Allen turning it over a few times and taking a few sacks.In Carolina's past five games, it's allowed 22 sacks and turned it over 11 times. Even Washington can take advantage.</p>
