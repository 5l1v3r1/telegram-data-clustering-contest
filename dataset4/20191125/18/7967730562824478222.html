      <h1>'The most successful accident': Adults-only Agro hits road for birthday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Toby Crockford</a></address>
      <p>From interviewing former prime minister Bob Hawke and 1980s heart-throb Jason Donovan, to advertising recycled toilet paper and cracking crude jokes at the expense of his co-hosts, Agro has enjoyed a colourful life during the past 30 years.</p>
      <p>Even though he admits it might kill him, puppeteer Jamie Dunn is taking Agro on a Queensland tour to celebrate the television icon's birthday.</p>

      <p>Dunn admits he never believed Agro - "the most successful accident around" - would become the national sensation he did.</p>
      <p>"I think it’s his eyebrows – the heritage he got from Mal Meninga. It’s just one big eyebrow that comes down like a roller door," he said.</p>
      <p>"In all seriousness, Agro had something different, he went through the kids, to adults and to grandparents.</p>
      <p>"When we did shopping centres, we did Westfield Strathpine [about 45 minutes north of Brisbane] and the parents and grandparents stayed with the kids for the show.</p>

      <p>"We only went there once because nobody was shopping, everyone was watching the show."</p>
      <p>When it comes to naming some of his favourite moments, Dunn has no hesitation.</p>
      <p>"You know you're massive when the prime minister wants to talk one-on-one," he said.</p>
      <p>"Agro was in an armchair and Bob Hawke was there - some would say there were two puppets in that one scene.</p>
      <p>"Then there was the statue of Wally Lewis ... and any guest on <i>Agro's Cartoon Connection</i> had to turn towards Wally and do the salute. Agro would not speak to them until that happened.</p>
      <p>"My favourite commercial was for recycled toilet tissue. I had to put my arm up through a dunny because the door opens and there's Agro sitting on the old dunny reading the paper. I just loved it."</p>
      <p>The character has sprung back into popular culture after an outtakes video attracted more than 4 million views online and ice-cream chain Wendy’s relaunched the official Agro Cone for his 30th birthday.</p>
      <p><i>Big Brother Australia</i> star Ben Zabel, better known as Ben from Brisbane, will join the tour during audience's adults-only journey back in time.</p>
      <p>Dunn was confident Agro's loyal audience from the '90s would buy tickets, and if sales did not go well, he would simply blame his new sidekick.</p>

      <p>The Agro puppet to be used on the tour is, in fact, Agro II after the original became very dirty and a replica was made with no custard on its cheeks.</p>
      <p>"The old one is in the bottom drawer of my dresser. When I die, probably just after these shows - and I use the term 'show' very loosely - he will be on eBay or hopefully the TV Hall of Fame," Dunn said.</p>
      <p>The show promises classic Agro outrageousness, with Zabel providing an "entirely new canvas".</p>
      <p>"It will be classic Agro while working with Ben, he is a wonderful man and I’m looking forward to working with someone new," Dunn said.</p>
      <p>"He’ll be tense ... but if for any reason I felt he didn’t have it, I wouldn’t be there – actually I would still be there for the money."</p>
      <p>However, there is one thing missing from the show that Mr Dunn would have liked.</p>
      <p>"I would love to have a guest spot on the night with Israel Folau and get stuck into that young man. According to Israel, I may have started the bushfires," Mr Dunn said.</p>
