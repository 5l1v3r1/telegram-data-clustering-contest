      <h1>Last Mount Rushmore carver dies at 98</h1>
      <h2>Don 'Nick' Clifford worked on it from 1938 to 1940</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:21:22+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:21</time> by <a rel="author">David Williams, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - The last remaining member of the team that carved the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/10/01/us/mount-rushmore-national-memorial-fast-facts/index.html">Mount Rushmore National Memorial</a> died on Saturday, according to his wife.</p>
      <p>Don "Nick" Clifford worked on Mount Rushmore from 1938 to 1940, according to the <a href="http://www.mountrushmorecarver.com/">self-published book</a> that he wrote with his wife, Carolyn. They were married for more than 45 years.</p>
      <p>Carolyn Clifford told CNN that she was talking to park rangers on Monday and making plans for a memorial service.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/10/us/mt-rushmore-carver-birthday-trnd/index.html">Clifford celebrated his 98th birthday in July</a>.</p>
      <p>Her husband was one of the almost 400 workers between 1927 and 1941 who used jackhammers, and dynamite to carve the 60-foot-tall heads of Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt and Lincoln into the side of the mountain.</p>
      <p>Clifford got the job as a teenager because he knew how to use a jackhammer from his time working in mines, he said in his book.</p>
      <p>Sculptor Gutzon Borglum <a href="https://www.nps.gov/moru/learn/historyculture/why-these-four-presidents.htm">selected the four presidents</a> to represent major events in the history of the United States: Washington represents its birth, Jefferson symbolizes its growth or expansion, Lincoln illustrates its preservation and Roosevelt embodies its development.</p>
      <p>The National Park Service says the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/moru/learn/historyculture/the-workers.htm">crews worked long hours in harsh and dangerous conditions</a>, but there wasn't a single fatality on the project.</p>
      <p>Clifford spent a lot of time at Mount Rushmore in the summers, chatting with visitors and signing copies of his book.</p>
      <p>At his birthday party in July, Carolyn <a href="https://www.kotatv.com/content/news/Mount-Rushmores-last-living-carver-celebrates-98th-birthday-512454552.html">told CNN affiliate KOTA</a> that her husband was kind of reserved.</p>
      <p>"He's been a wonderful man. He's very kind and generous, and somewhat shy," she told KOTA. "You wouldn't know that since he's in the public, but he enjoys what he's doing a lot."</p>
