      <h1>Dodge Journey Replacement Plans Just Got More Interesting</h1>
      <h2>Looks like Dodge is plotting a new HEMI-powered performance SUV to replace the Journey.</h2>

      <p>The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/dodge/journey">Dodge Journey</a> has been around since the 2009 model year. While it boasts a spacious cabin and an affordable price tag, the Journey is showing its age and looks dated compared to other newer crossovers on the market. A replacement is long overdue. FCA passenger car brand chief Steve Beahm has already admitted the Journey is living on borrowed time, as is the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/dodge/grand-caravan">Grand Caravan</a>.</p>
      <p>When these models get discontinued, Dodge will only have three core models in its lineup: the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/dodge/challenger-coupe">Challenger</a>, Charger, and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/dodge/durango">Durango</a>. According to Mopar Insiders, however, Dodge is plotting a new high-performance five-passenger utility vehicle to fill the void left by the Journey.</p>

      <p>Sources have told the publication that the new utility vehicle will be based on the Giorgio architecture that underpins the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/alfa-romeo/giulia">Alfa Romeo Giulia</a> and Stelvio, meaning it will be offered with rear-wheel drive or optional all-wheel drive. The same platform will also underpin the next-generation <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/jeep/grand-cherokee">Jeep Grand Cherokee</a> that's expected to debut in time for the 2020 model year, including the new three-row variant.</p>
      <p>In terms of size, the new model will reportedly have similar proportions to the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/alfa-romeo/stelvio">Alfa Romeo Stelvio</a> and share styling cues with the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/dodge/charger">Dodge Charger</a>, so it should look sporty. It isn't clear if the new SUV will keep the Journey moniker or adopt a new name, however.</p>

      <p>Several powertrain options will also be available, including a range-topping Hemi V8. Details of the displacement and horsepower are unknown, but Fiat Chrysler currently offers 5.7-liter and 6.4-liter variants of the Hemi V8. We'd also love to see it pack the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/alfa-romeo/stelvio-quadrifoglio">Stelvio Quadrifoglio</a>'s Ferrari-derived twin-turbo 2.9-liter V6 that produces 505 hp.</p>
      <p>Several trim levels will also be available including a Scat Pack model. The focus will also be on on-road performance rather than off-road capability, so when combined with rear-wheel drive it should also be a lot more fun to drive than the current Journey. As for when Dodge's new midsized UV will arrive, sources claim it will go on sale in 2022 possibly as a 2023 model.</p>
