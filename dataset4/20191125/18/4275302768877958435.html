      <p>Families were invited to Charlotte Street for a fun afternoon of entertainment, music and refreshments before the lights on a giant tree outside Society were turned on at 6pm.</p>
      <p>It followed the successful reindeer parade which kicked off the festivities last weekend.</p>
      <p>Saturday also saw the launch of Kirkcaldy4All’s Christmas Star Trail, which will see 30 stars – some over a metre tall – appearing in shop windows in the town centre, with a map guiding families to them.</p>
      <p>The stars have all been decorated by local schools and artists, or the businesses themselves, and shoppers who spot all them will be in with a chnce of winning a £100 shopping voucher.</p>
      <p>Bill Harvey, manager at Kirkcaldy4All, said: “This is the third year we have worked with the Mercat Shopping Centre to bring some Christmas cheer to the town and help its local businesses.</p>
      <p>“We are grateful to all the town centre businesses and local schools for supporting these initiatives so enthusiastically, and hope that the people of Kirkcaldy will also get behind us and come down to the high street and enjoy what’s on offer in the run-up to Christmas.”</p>
      <p>A Candy Cane Cocktail Trail will also be held for the first time for adults. Nine bars and pubs in the town will have the drinks on sale.</p>
