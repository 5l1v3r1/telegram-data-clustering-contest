      <h1>Even Legoland is Doing Black Friday</h1>

      <p>So far Lego's Black Friday tie-in sales have been rather mediocre, but it seems the company's English theme park is getting ready for a Black Friday sale of its own. Thankfully it doesn't mean you have to go to swarm down to Windsor and clog up the rides this Friday.</p>
      <p>No; instead <a href="http://www.legoland.co.uk/blackfriday">Legoland Windsor's 'Brick Friday' event</a> will offer discounts on visiting Legoland during the Christmas period, lettings kids stay free in the park's hotels in 2020, plus discounts on VIP packages next year.</p>
      <p>The Christmas deal will offer families the chance to snag tickets to see Father Christmas for £25 a person on 6th, 13th, and 20th December, while tickets to see Father Christmas and enjoy the park's rides will be £36 a person - a saving of eleven whole pounds. Obviously Legoland goes all in with Christmas, even going so far as to shut the park down in the weeks beforehand and decorate the place.</p>
      <p>If you don't want to see Father Christmas, but still want to check out the rides, you can get tickets for £15 per person, provided you go on certain dates, which are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>30th November</li>
        <li>1st December</li>
        <li>6th-8th December</li>
        <li>13-15th December</li>
        <li>20-24th December</li>
        <li>27th December to 6th January</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The kids go free offer applies to stays at the Legoland Windsor Resort between 13th March and 1st November 2020. You can choose to stay in both Legoland's own hotels, or one of the nearby (cheaper) partner hotels. This bundle comes with an overnight stay, a second day free park entry, and free meals for kids at the partner hotels.</p>
      <p>The VIP package discounts cover a shark feeding experience and the 'Model Maker for the Day' experience. Tickets normally cost £75 per person for the sharks, and £250 per person for the model making, but the Black Friday discount means they'll cost £30 and £150 per person, respectively. It's worth noting that these experiences are for *kids*, and not kidults.</p>
      <p>The shark feeding experience is pretty self-explanatory, and means you get to feed the sharks their breakfast before getting priority access to the Atlantis Submarine Voyage ride. Model Making is a bit trickier, and has you shadowing one of <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2017/11/an-inside-look-at-legoland-windsors-model-making-division/">the park's Master Builders</a> as they work making new models and maintaining the existing ones. It also includes a buffet breakfast and lunch, early access to the Ninjago ride, a Legoland uniform to wear and keep, and a figure of mini Model Maker to take home.</p>
      <p>Both experiences will be available to book between 13th March and 1st November 2020.</p>
      <p>Deals go live this Friday. <a href="http://www.legoland.co.uk/blackfriday">Experience and park ticket deals can be found here</a>, <a href="http://www.legolandholidays.co.uk/blackfriday">while hotel deals can be found here.</a></p>
