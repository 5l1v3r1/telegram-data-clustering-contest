      <p>Rapper Edem has lighted up the internet after a video of him preparing banku or probably ‘akple’ hit the net.</p>
      <p>Apparently the rapper, real name Denning Edem Hotor has some great culinary skills as he stirs the popular local dish to the delight of his friends who were videoing him.</p>
      <p>One of his friends even joked that it’s only a real man who knows how to cook that can ride a woman in bed.</p>
      <p>Banku or its variant Akple is a Ghanaian dish which is cooked by a proportionate mixture of fermented corn and cassava dough in hot water into a smooth, whitish paste, served with soup, stew or a pepper sauce with fish.</p>
