      <p>One of the area's biggest funeral home operators has been acquired by a publicly traded company out of Texas, marking the end of its independence even though it will continue operating under its name and family management.</p>
      <p>Carriage Services Inc., a major national operator of funeral homes and cemeteries, did not say how much it paid to acquire Buffalo's Lombardo Funeral Homes, which marks the company's entry into the Western New York market. Carriage, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, runs 183 funeral homes in 29 states and 29 cemeteries in 11 states, and operates as a consolidator of what it calls the "deathcare services" industry.</p>
      <p>Founded in 1907 by Joseph Lombardo Sr., and then led successively by his wife, his two sons and now his grandson, Lombardo Funeral Homes has four locations that serve about 2,000 families per year. Joseph P. Lombardo, the current president, said he talked to four companies before settling on Carriage. He will remain as head of Lombardo.</p>
