      <p>The 77-year-old billionaire <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-bloomberg/#5a28b88a1417">cofounded financial information and media company Bloomberg LP</a> in 1981, and he owns 88% of the business, according to Forbes.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bloomberg-hit-10-billion-in-annual-revenue-2019-1">Bloomberg LP brought in $10 billion in revenue</a> in 2018 and <a href="https://www.mikebloomberg.com/about/">employs almost 20,000 people</a> in 176 locations in 120 countries.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Born on Valentine’s Day in 1942, Bloomberg grew up in Medford, Massachusetts, a small city near Boston.</h3>

      <p>According to his website, <a href="https://www.mikebloomberg.com/about/">Bloomberg grew up in a middle-class family</a> and was in the Boy Scouts.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>After graduating from Johns Hopkins with an electrical engineering degree and earning an MBA from Harvard, Bloomberg went to work on Wall Street.</h3>

        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.my/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>He landed a job at Salomon Brothers in New York City, where he spent countless hours counting out stocks and bonds in the bank’s vault. <a href="https://www.mikebloomberg.com/about/">His starting salary was $9,000 a year</a>, according to his website.</p>
      <p>He eventually worked his way up the ranks and was named partner in 1972.</p>
      <p>In 1978, Bloomberg was put in charge of running the firm’s information technology division, which<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-bloomberg-achieved-massive-success-2015-1"> was a clear demotion</a>, according to John Sviokla and Mitch Cohen, authors of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Self-made-Billionaire-Effect-Producers/dp/159184763X?tag=bisafetynet2-20">The Self-Made Billionaire Effect: </a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Self-made-Billionaire-Effect-Producers/dp/159184763X?tag=bisafetynet2-20">How Extreme Producers Create Massive Value</a>.”</p>
      <p>Regardless, Bloomberg stayed at Salomon for three more years until the company merged with commodity trading firm Phibro in 1981 and let Bloomberg go with <a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/features/14573/">a severance check to the tune of $10 million.</a></p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>After leaving Salomon, Bloomberg used part of his severance to start his own business, a financial information technology company now known as Bloomberg LP.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Originally called Innovative Market Solutions, the company <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/life-of-michael-bloomberg-2014-9?op=1">aimed to make it easier for traders</a> to wade through data.</p>
      <p>It eventually debuted the Bloomberg terminal (first known as the MarketMaster terminal), and <a href="https://www.mikebloomberg.com/about/">Merrill Lynch was the first customer</a>, purchasing 22 of them and investing $30 million in the company for a 30% stake.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Bloomberg LP became widely successful throughout the ’80s and was worth $2 billion by 1989.</h3>

      <p>While in office, Bloomberg – already a billionaire – <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/nyregion/cost-of-being-mayor-650-million-if-hes-rich.html">accepted only $1 a year</a> throughout his 12 years in the mayor’s office, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/nyregion/cost-of-being-mayor-650-million-if-hes-rich.html">rejecting a salary</a> that would have amounted to $2.7 million throughout his tenure, according to The New York Times.</p>
      <p>Instead, Bloomberg spent $650,000 of his own personal fortune throughout his time as mayor, including roughly $6 million on private plane travel, according to the Times.</p>
      <p>When he wanted to run for a third term as mayor, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;amp;sid=aIFJHAgau83s">Bloomberg campaigned to change the law</a> that limited officials to only two terms in office – and won.</p>

      <p>In 2014, Bloomberg pledged to spend $50 million to build a grassroots network of voters dedicated to curbing gun violence, which led to the formation of <a href="https://everytown.org/who-we-are/">Everytown for Gun Safety</a>, a nonprofit organization that advocates for gun control.</p>

      <p>With his massive fortune, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-bloomberg-reasons-he-didnt-run-for-president-2019-2">Bloomberg could outspend much of the Democratic primary field</a>, Rebecca Katz, a progressive strategist and former aide to Mayor Bill de Blasio, told Insider in February. Indeed, Business Insider’s Mary Hanbury reported on Saturday (before the former mayor had even officially announced his candidacy) that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mike-bloomberg-spends-30-million-on-tv-ads-eclipsing-rivals-2019-11">Bloomberg spent $30 million on TV ads in a single week</a> – more than all his Democratic rivals spent in an entire year.</p>
      <p>But his relatively moderate policy positions and his status as a 77-year-old wealthy white man could hurt him.</p>
      <p>“For too long the people at the top of the Democratic Party have been wealthier, whiter, more male, and more conservative than the base of the Democratic Party which looks a lot more like [Rep.] Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,” Waleed Shahid, communications director for Justice Democrats, told Insider earlier this year.</p>
