      <h2>An 82-year-old woman said she was the target of a home break-in until she turned the situation around for the alleged intruder. Hint — it did not end well for him.</h2>

      <p>Willie Murphy, 82, says she was getting ready for bed just after 11 p.m. Thursday night when she heard a man pounding upon her door, urging her to call an ambulance on his behalf, WHAM <a href="https://13wham.com/news/local/he-picked-the-wrong-house-82-year-old-beats-up-break-in-suspect">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“He was outside and saying, ‘Please call an ambulance,’ saying, ‘I’m sick, I’m sick,’” she recalled.</p>
      <p>Murphy called the police but would not let the man inside her home. She became angry when the man started to break down her door.</p>
      <p>“I hear a loud noise,” Murphy said. “I’m thinking, ‘What the heck was that?’ The young man is in my home. He broke the door.”</p>
      <p>What the suspect did not realize is that Murphy is a bodybuilder who works out every day at the local YMCA to keep fit.</p>
      <p>Murphy has even won awards for being a competitive power-lifter, ESPN <a href="https://www.espn.com/espnw/life-style/story/_/id/24200181/at-81-willie-murphy-competitive-powerlifter">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Murphy said it was dark outside so she was able to find a hiding place while the suspect walked right into her house. She acted quickly to grab the closest item to her — a table — and used it to beat the home invasion suspect into submission.</p>
      <p>She also grabbed a bottle of shampoo and poured it all over him before hitting him with a broom.</p>
      <p>By the time officers arrived, the man was sent away in an ambulance and first responders <a href="https://twitter.com/RochesterNYPD/status/1198987973125169153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2F13wham.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Fhe-picked-the-wrong-house-82-year-old-beats-up-break-in-suspect">applauded</a> Murphy for her self-defense tactics.</p>

      <p>“The officers that came wanted to go on my front porch and take selfies with me,” she said.</p>
      <p>She returned to the Rochester YMCA on Friday where she works out and got a hero’s welcome.</p>
