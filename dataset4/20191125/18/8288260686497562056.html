      <h2>Latest West Bromwich Albion transfer rumours | We take a look at the players who have been tipped to make a move to The Hawthorns in the new year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:45:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:45</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Dicken, https://www.facebook.com/alexdickenjournalist/?fref=ts, Chris Watson, Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>The 2020 January transfer window is just around the corner, and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Bromwich Albion</a> look to be in a good place going into the New Year.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">Baggies </a>are currently top of the Sky Bet Championship table, as they and the rest of the teams in the league enjoy a break thanks to the last round of internationals in the calendar year.</p>
      <p>Slaven Bilic can feel pleased with the start he has made as Albion boss, but he, like most managers in the country, will also have one eye on the upcoming transfer window.</p>
      <p>Could we see Albion dip into the transfer market and strengthen their squad to help secure a promotion push in the second half of the season?</p>
      <p>That will no doubt change between now and January as Bilic, along with technical director Luke Dowling, irons out the areas he believes need strengthening.</p>
      <p>Here are the players who have been linked with Albion so far...</p>

      <h3>Dwight Gayle</h3>
      <p>The Baggies continue to be linked with Newcastle United striker Dwight Gayle and are tipped to re-sign him in January.</p>
      <p>Gayle's future is set to be decided in January and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">Albion</a> are keen to re-sign the striker after his successful loan spell at The Hawthorns last season.</p>
      <p>Gayle scored 24 goals in 42 Championship matches for the Baggies as they missed out on promotion to the Premier League.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/what-dwight-gayle-told-newcastle-17180764">Reports recently have suggested</a> Albion made a play to sign Gayle on loan at the end of the summer transfer window but the striker would prefer a permanent transfer.</p>

      <h3>Ronald Sobowale</h3>
      <p>West Brom have been credited with an interest in young forward Ronald Sobowale - the cousin of Bayern Munich and Austria star David Alaba.</p>
      <p>Sobowale, 22, was originally in the Chelsea academy, but was released at the age of 15 having lined up alongside the likes of Tammy Abraham and Dominic Solanke.</p>
      <p>Trials with Cardiff City, Barnsley and Brentford wouldn’t bear any fruit.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, Londoner Sobowale has been tearing it up in non-league to attract interest from the upper reaches of the English football ladder once more.</p>
      <p>The Whyteleafe striker has also been on trial with Albion’s Championship rivals Middlesbrough, but Premier League pair Leicester City and Watford - as well as Fulham - are all monitoring him, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7624783/Leicester-Watford-clubs-keeping-tabs-David-Alabas-cousin-Ronald-Sobowale.html">according to the Daily Mail.</a></p>

      <h3>Sam McCallum</h3>
      <p>Coventry City's 19-year-old full-back Sam McCallum is another player to have been linked with West Brom.</p>
      <p>Young defender McCallum, who has recently turned 19, enjoyed a breakthrough into the Sky Blues first team last season but has featured more regularly from the off under Robins this term.</p>
      <p>He signed a new contract in March which runs until the summer of 2022, but clubs in divisions above Coventry are already supposedly circling - including Albion.</p>
      <p>Sky Blues boss Mark Robins insists McCallum won't be sold on the cheap though. <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/monumental-bid-west-brom-leeds-16993382">He told CoventryLive:</a> “There’s no interest or appetite to sell and I wouldn’t think it would be beneficial for him to go anywhere at this stage."</p>
