      <h1>Nottingham Forest defender earns Championship recognition following Bristol City stalemate</h1>
      <h2>Latest Nottingham Forest news | The Reds played out a goalless draw with the Robins in the Championship clash at Ashton Gate on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:39:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:39</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>’s goalless draw with Bristol City at the weekend has seen one of their players earn some recognition.</p>
      <p>Left-back Jack Robinson has earned a place in WhoScored.com’s Championship team of the week for his performance at Ashton Gate.</p>
      <p>The former Liverpool defender has been handed a score of 7.5, and joins Fulham’s Denis Odoi, Millwall's Shaun Hutchinson and Stoke City’s Danny Batth in making up the rest of the back four.</p>
      <p>Millwall's Jed Wallace was deemed to be the star player of the weekend with a score of 9.2, after scoring his side’s only goal in the 1-0 win over Swansea City.</p>
      <p>Robinson will be hoping to put in another impressive performance for the Reds when they take on Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Robinson was released by QPR in the summer of 2018 and was subsequently signed by the Reds on a free transfer. He made four-year 42 appearances during his spell in west London</p>
