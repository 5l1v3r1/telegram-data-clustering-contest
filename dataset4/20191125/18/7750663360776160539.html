      <h1>Manchester City assistant Mikel Arteta 'ready to talk to Arsenal'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-city/"><b>Manchester City</b></a> assistant <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mikel-arteta/"><b>Mikel Arteta</b></a> is allegedly interested in holding talks with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/"><b>Arsenal</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>As <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/unai-emery/"><b>Unai Emery</b></a> continues to fight for his job at the Emirates Stadium, speculation persists regarding a change in the Gunners dugout.</p>
      <p>Having been linked with his former club in the past, Arteta is again likely to be among the north London outfit's thoughts should they part ways with Emery.</p>
      <p>While the Spaniard is enjoying his time with City, <i>The Times</i> claims that he is open to holding discussions with the Arsenal hierarchy.</p>
      <p>Should Everton opt to sack <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marco-silva/"><b>Marco Silva</b></a>, Arteta is also likely to be a contender for that managerial role, potentially putting Arsenal under pressure to make a decision regarding Emery.</p>
      <p>Arteta spent the final five years of his playing career at Arsenal before hanging up his boots in 2016.</p>
