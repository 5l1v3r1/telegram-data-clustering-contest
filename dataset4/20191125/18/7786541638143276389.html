      <p><b>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP)</b> - International experts are in Bolivia to investigate the deadly violence that followed a disputed Oct. 20 vote and the resignation of former President Evo Morales.</p>
      <p>Members of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on Monday arrived in the central city of Sacaba, where nine Morales supporters were killed in a clash with security forces on Nov. 15.</p>
      <p>Paulo Abrão, executive secretary of the Washington-based commission, says investigators are listening to all sides and will push authorities to "render justice, compensate victims and clarify the facts."</p>
      <p>At least 32 people died during protests since last month. Morales claimed victory in the election that international observers said was marred by irregularities.</p>
      <p>Morales resigned and went into exile on Nov. 10.</p>
      <p>Protests have eased and Bolivia's interim government is calling for new elections.</p>
