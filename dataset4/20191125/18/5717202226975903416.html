      <h1>Arsenal fans react as talk over Mikel Arteta increases</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:15:53+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/tom-procter/" target="_blank">Tom Procter</a></address>
      <p>Some Arsenal fans have been discussing the prospect of Mikel Arteta becoming the club’s next manager after another disappointing result under Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>Pressure is seriously mounting on the Spaniard now, with the club winless in the last six games in all competitions.</p>
      <p>The Gunners were lucky to come away with a 2-2 draw on Saturday against Southampton, who might have scored four or five on the day.</p>

      <p>The majority of Arsenal supporters appear to be ‘Emery out’ at this point due to things such as a lack of leadership and questionable tactics.</p>
      <p>The board have given Emery their backing in recent weeks, but his position as first-team manager is surely under serious threat.</p>
      <p>There have many names touted as potential replacements for the former Paris Saint-Germain manager, the latest being former midfielder Mikel Arteta (<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/sport/arsenal-set-sights-on-mikel-arteta-with-unai-emery-on-brink-cgc60vgsj?wgu=270525_54264_15746856198026_31ba8c7e4c&amp;wgexpiry=1582461619&amp;utm_source=planit&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=22278">The Times</a>).</p>
      <p>The 37-year-old has been Pep Guardiola’s assistant manager at Manchester City since 2016 and has won two league titles with the club, and the view is that he could soon be ready to take charge of a club.</p>
      <p>That is certainly the suggestion from Guardiola, who spoke of his number two in a press conference today.</p>

      <p>Arsenal would be a massive challenge for him, but he was a popular figure during his five years at the Emirates and many fans are at the end of their tether with Emery.</p>
      <h3>Arsenal fans react</h3>
      <p>Amid speculation Arsenal may consider their former captain, who has also been linked with Everton, fans have given a largely positive reaction on social media.</p>
