      <p>Muhammad gave the advice in Abuja in his address at the opening of 2019 All Nigeria Judges’ Conference of Superior Courts holding at the National Judicial Institute.</p>
      <p>The theme of the conference was: “Sustaining Democracy through Effective and Efficient Administration of Justice’’.</p>
      <p>He said there was a need for judges to redouble their standards in the process of discharging adjudicatory functions in order to sustain public confidence.</p>
      <p>The CJN said: “In order to sustain public confidence in the judiciary, judges must continue to be proactive by not allowing technicalities to stand in the way of substantive justice.’’</p>
      <p>He noted that relying on technicalities in justice dispensation contributed to the delay of justice delivery.</p>

      <p>“Technicalities in itself sometimes constitute unreasonable delay in dispensing with cases.</p>
      <p>“Timely disposition of cases in our courts will in no small measure shore up public confidence in the judiciary,’’ Justice Muhammad added.</p>
      <p>He said the delay in justice delivery and the volume of cases on the dockets of courts still left much to be desired.</p>
      <p>He, however, said that urgent reforms were being put in place to take care of the challenges.</p>
      <p>“In our desire to curb the delay in justice delivery, we have automated the Nigerian judiciary and developed and deployed the Nigerian Case Management System (NCMS) software,’’ he concluded. (NAN)</p>
