      <h1>Samsung Confuses Everyone Over S11 Lite</h1>

      <p>Samsung Galaxy S11 rumours have been heating up but a new piece of information suggests some predictions, like the addition of a Galaxy S11 Lite, have been a bit off.</p>
      <p>While it doesn't look like we were right about getting a Galaxy S11 Lite, we might be getting a new S10 product out of it. According to a new inclusion on the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) database, a Galaxy <i>S10</i> Lite is on the way with the model number SM-G770F, <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s10-lite-fcc-closer-to-release/">as spotted by SamMobile</a>.</p>

      <p>Ishan Agarwal, a known leaker, has said the Lite will come with a Snapdragon 855 processor and an impressive camera boasting a 48MP main camera, 5MP depth lens and a 12MP wide angle lens on the rear. It's selfie camera will reportedly be 32MP.</p>

      <p>Given the S10 series already has a pretty full lineup with the S10, S10+, S10e and S10 5G, we assumed the Lite leaks would replace the S11e when the new series is eventually released. This new information seems to suggest a S11 version of it isn't on the immediate horizon.</p>
      <p>We've reached to Samsung to confirm the Lite model is solely for the Galaxy S10 series, and not the S11. [<a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s10-lite-fcc-closer-to-release/">Via SamMobile</a>]</p>
