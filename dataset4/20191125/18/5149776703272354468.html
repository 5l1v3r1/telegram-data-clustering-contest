      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:03:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:03</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Gorman</a></address>
      <p>Get ready to roll out the red carpet, prime time TV hero Les Dennis, Noughties teen heart-throb Gareth Gates, Corrie baddie Connor McIntyre (Pat Phelan) and the one and only Sooty, have landed in Nottingham.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/celebrity-cast-revealed-nottinghams-theatre-2769012">star-studded line-up</a> will be treading the city's boards in this year's Theatre Royal panto, Cinderella, from Saturday, November 30 to Sunday, January 5, 2020.</p>
      <p>First things first however, the pros need to knuckle down and rehearse.</p>
      <p>In five days time Les and Connor will be unrecognisable as the Ugly Sisters, alongside Pop Idol star Gareth Gates as Prince Charming and Richard Cadell and Sooty starring as Buttons.</p>
