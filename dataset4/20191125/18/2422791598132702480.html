      <h1>Leader of major LGBTQ organization in Haiti found dead</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:20:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:20</time> by <a rel="author">The Associated Press, Staff</a></address>
      <p>PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- Charlot Jeudy, the leader of a prominent LGBTQ organization in Haiti, was found dead on Monday, according to friends.</p>
      <p>Geraldine Clair Museau, a member of the group known as Kouraj, which means "courage," in English, told The Associated Press that Jeudy's body was found at his home in the capital of Port-au-Prince.</p>
      <p>It wasn't immediately clear how he died, and police didn't return calls for comment.</p>
      <p>Jeudy has spoken out against homophobia and was forced to cancel a festival celebrating the Afro-Caribbean LGBTQ community in 2016 because of numerous threats of violence.</p>
      <p>In a statement on his group's website, Jeudy had vowed to keep fighting discrimination.</p>
      <p>"Faced with such permanent and brutal stigmatization, violence, and insults, many of us -- if not the totality -- have lost hope to see our own dignity respected. ... That is what I want to fight," he wrote.</p>
      <p>Haiti's LGBTQ community remains mostly underground because of social stigma, although there are no laws criminalizing homosexual relations as there are in several English-speaking Caribbean islands.</p>
      <p>A 2015 human rights report on Haiti by the U.S. State Department said "local attitudes remained hostile to outward" LGBTQ identification and expression, especially in the capital.</p>
