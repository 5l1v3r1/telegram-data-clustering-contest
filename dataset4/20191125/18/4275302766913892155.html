      <p>Hayden Campbell fled in the face of other traffic through the town centre, twice losing officers who were following at 50mph in the January evening pursuit.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has now been fined, banned and ordered to carry out unpaid work by a sheriff who told Campbell he had been lucky not to go to jail.</p>
      <p>Campbell, of Pitforthie Place, Brechin, admitted driving dangerously, failing to stop for police and driving without L-plates in various streets in the town on January 19.</p>
      <p>Depute fiscal Jill Drummond said the chase was sparked when officers saw the accused behind the wheeel and activated their blue lights to try to get him to stop.</p>
      <p>Instead of pulling over, he immediately overtook the vehicle in front of him and fled.</p>
      <p>He sped along narrow Damacre Road, where there were cars parked on both sides and several pedestrians, before turning into City Road and being lost to sight.</p>
      <p>“Police caught up with him again and at Montrose Street where there is a blind left hand turn he drove straight over the junction failing to stop,” added the fiscal.</p>
      <p>It was more than two weeks later when police caught up with Campbell after they went to the home of the car’s former owner who said he had sold the vehicle to him.</p>
      <p>Defence solicitor Nick Markowski said: “He has asked me to apologise for his actions on the night in question.</p>
      <p>“He held a provisional licence and took the foolish decision to drive the vehicle.</p>
      <p>“It was an immature decision and a minute’s madness.</p>
      <p>“Fortunately there wasn’t an accident, but obviously the potential was there,” said Mr Markowski.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Derek Reekie told Campbell: “It sounds to me it was significantly more than a minute’s madness.</p>
      <p>“You shouldn’t have been driving anyway. You took a chance because it was raining and were driving in an outrageous manner in a built-up area.”</p>
      <p>Campbell was banned for 21 months, ordered to carry out 135 hours unpaid work and fined £900.</p>
      <p>He must also sit an extended driving test at the end of the disqualification.</p>
