Two correctional officers responsible for guarding Epstein the night he killed himself have been charged with falsifying prison records. A grand jury indictment made public Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2019, accused guards Toval Noel and Michael Thomas of failing to perform checks on Epstein every half hour, as required, and of fabricating log entries to show they had.

      <p><b>NEW YORKÂ (AP)</b> - A judge has set an April trial date for two jail guards accused of failing to make required checks on Jeffrey Epstein the day he died.</p>
      <p>U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres said Monday that the trial of guards Tova Noel and Michael Thomas can begin April 20.</p>
      <p>They have pleaded not guilty to lying on prison records to make it seem as though they had made required checks on the financier before he was found unresponsive in his cell Aug. 10.</p>
      <p>New York City's medical examiner ruled Epstein's death a suicide.</p>
      <p>Epstein was awaiting trial on charges he sexually abused teenage girls at his Manhattan mansion and a Florida home.</p>
      <p>A defense lawyer says the guards are scapegoats for many failings in a trouble-plagued federal lockup.</p>
