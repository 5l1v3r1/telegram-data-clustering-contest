      <h1>Willie Taggart, Florida State Reportedly Never Signed A Formal Contract</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:07:39+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Florida State fired Willie Taggart midway through the 2019 season, despite the fact that it has to pay him approximately an $18 million buyout. But a contract snafu could wind up saving the Seminoles a whole heck of a lot of money.</p>
      <p>Matt Baker of the <i>Tampa Bay Times</i> reports Monday that <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/sports/seminoles/2019/11/25/willie-taggart-never-signed-a-final-contract-heres-why-it-could-matter/">Taggart and Florida State never actually signed a formal contract.</a> There was an initial letter – but the two sides never actually signed a contract later on.</p>
      <p>Baker reports that experts say it’s possible Florida State could consider Taggart an at-will employee – meaning it wouldn’t have to pay out his buyout.</p>
      <p>It’s a complicated matter, and you can be sure that Taggart will sue if he isn’t paid his buyout. Apparently, there is some precedent here too.</p>

      <p>Former Kentucky head coach Billy Gillispie found himself in the same situation back in 2009. The Wildcats wound up paying about half of what he thought they owed him in a settlement.</p>
      <p>If the report is correct, this is a massive oversight by Taggart and his lawyers. He could potentially miss out on millions of dollars.</p>
      <p>Florida State, meanwhile, is still looking for its next head coach. The Seminoles are 6-5 with a matchup with rival Florida left on the schedule.</p>
