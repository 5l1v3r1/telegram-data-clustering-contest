      <p>Accra, Nov. 25, GNA - Alhaji Mohamed N.D. Jawula, former chairman of the Ghana Football Association President (GFA) has been named as the new Chairman of a new seven-member Premier League Management Committee (PLMC).</p>
      <p>The GFA announced that Jesse Agyapong, a marketing consultant would be the Vice Chairman of the Committee with the Premier League clubs expected to nominate five other members to serve on the committee.</p>
      <p>The formation of the new committee was triggered after the GFA discarded the system which had all Premier League clubs represented on the Premier League Board as it was formerly known.</p>
      <p>The PLMC would serve a one-year term while the GFA engages Premier League Clubs towards an autonomous league.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the official date for the new football season would kick start on December 21, 2019.</p>
