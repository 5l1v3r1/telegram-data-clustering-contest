      <p>A 19 year-old boy tied a 17 year-old girl down and raped her after she withdrew consent for sex during foreplay, police say.</p>
      <p>Jamar Brandon Dulaney was arrested Friday, three months after he and his alleged victim had initiated consensual sexual contact at his home in Montgomery, Alabama.</p>
      <p>The girl, who has not been named to protect her identity, then changed her mind during the August 7 encounter, it is alleged.</p>
      <p>That prompted Dulaney to tie her hands and legs together and have sex with her against her will, court papers say.</p>
      <p>Further details of how the attack ended and how Dulaney’s victim escaped have not yet been made public.</p>
      <p>It is unclear whether Dulaney’s alleged victim reported him to police at the time, or waited until just before his arrest last week.</p>
