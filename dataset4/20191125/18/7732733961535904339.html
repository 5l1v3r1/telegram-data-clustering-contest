      <h1>8BitDo's tiny Bluetooth gamepad is now available to pre-order</h1>
      <h2>The Zero 2 will set you back $19.99</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:00:55+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shawn Knight</a></address>
      <h4>In a nutshell: At $19.99 each, the Zero 2 could serve as an excellent backup controller. Given its small size and lack of joystick, however, you’re probably not going to want to use it as your go-to gamepad unless you have really petite hands.</h4>
      <p>8BitDo is now accepting pre-orders for its keychain-sized Bluetooth controller.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/zero2/">Zero 2</a>, as it is affectionately called, measures 73mm x 36.5mm x 14.7mm (2.87” x 1.44” x 0.58”) and tips the scales at just 20 grams. They are offered in a variety of colors including pink, blue and yellow and are compatible with Windows, MacOS, Raspberry Pi and the Nintendo Switch.</p>

      <p>The minuscule gamepad is a standard affair. You get a directional pad, four primary action buttons, start and select buttons and top-mounted shoulder buttons. A micro-USB cable for charging purposes is also included. 8BitDo tells us that the 180mAh battery is good for around eight hours of play time with recharges taking 1-2 hours. The fact that it lacks a joystick means it’s intended only for 2D games.</p>
      <p>8BitDo also recently announced its <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/82737-8bitdo-n30-wireless-mouse-must-have-nes-lovers.html">N30 wireless mouse</a> that is modeled after the original Nintendo Entertainment System. That nostalgia-inducing piece of hardware is priced at $24.99 but appears to be out of stock at the moment.</p>
      <p>Those interested in securing their pre-order can do so over on Amazon. According to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081HML6MP?tag=httpwwwtechsp-20">product page</a>, they’ll ship on December 31, 2019.</p>
