      <h1>Mourinho rules out Zlatan signing for Spurs</h1>

      <p>Jose Mourinho says there is “no chance” of Tottenham signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic after the veteran forward was linked with a move to the club following his exit from LA Galaxy.</p>
      <p>Mourinho worked with Ibrahimovic at Inter Milan and Manchester United but said signing the 38-year-old would not make sense with Harry Kane at his disposal.</p>
      <p>“You are right about the connection, we have more than a connection,” Mourinho said when asked on Monday whether he would be trying to sign the Swede.</p>
      <p>“I would say also passion and understanding, an amazing player and an amazing guy, but I would say ‘no’. No chance.</p>
      <p>“We have the best striker in England, we have one of the top two or three strikers in the world, it doesn’t make any sense for a striker of Zlatan’s dimension, obviously in his late 30s, but still a striker that can play in any club in the world.”</p>
      <p>It has been a hectic first week for Mourinho at the Spurs helm following his appointment last week.</p>
      <p>After his unveiling to the media on Thursday, he had his first game 48 hours later at West Ham, which Spurs won 3-2, and is now preparing for a Champions League clash with Olympiakos on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Tottenham, who reached the Champions League final last season, would qualify for the knockout stages with a win or if they drew and Red Star failed to beat Bayern.</p>
      <p>Mourinho said he had not yet contacted his friend Mauricio Pochettino, who was sacked by Spurs last week.</p>
      <p>“I needed that little bit of space to process things when I left previous clubs,” said the former Chelsea and Manchester United boss. “It does not take just five or six days to be open again.</p>
      <p>“You take a little bit of time to process things and understand and to think and rethink. You speak with people and in a couple of weeks he will be fine and I will call him.”</p>
      <p>Part of Mourinho’s remit at Spurs is to do one thing that Pochettino could not do — win silverware.</p>
      <p>“I love the competition (Champions League) as much as everyone in football,” said Mourinho, who won the trophy with Porto and Inter Milan.</p>
      <p>“It’s something that everybody dreams about, to win it. Not everyone has the privilege to be a Champions League winner, which I was happy enough to do twice.</p>
      <p>“Do I want to win it a third time? Of course, I would love it but I know the difficulties of it.</p>
      <p>“But with these boys, I will never be afraid of any Champions League match that comes into our faces. I repeat, we need to qualify, that is the focus. I always say that.”</p>
