      <h2>A home buyer had approached TNRERA over delay in completing his property</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:47:11+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Sanjay-Vijayakumar-735/" target="_blank">Sanjay Vijayakumar</a></address>
      <p>The Tamil Nadu Real Estate Regulatory Authority (TNRERA) has ruled that builders cannot levy service tax on home buyers, if there is no such provision in the construction-cum-sale agreement.</p>
      <p>The ruling was given on a complaint from Venkatakrishnan Ramaswamy who had booked villa in the project “Dhakshin City/Avenue Phase-IV” developed by Green Avenue Homes and Gardens at Unamancherry village in Kancheepuram district.</p>
      <p>The construction agreement was signed in January 2013 and the construction activity commenced in October that year. However, there is delay in completion of the villa and the common facilities.</p>
      <p>In his response, the builder said that the project could not be completed due to delay in some payments by the buyer and service tax.</p>
      <p>The developer claimed that the buyer had agreed to pay the service tax for the villa, but did not pay the same.</p>
      <p>As a result, he faced problems from the Income Tax authorities for non-payment of service tax and his bank accounts were frozen.</p>
      <p>The developer said it could not provide the amenities promised in the Phase I to V of the project.</p>
      <p>TNRERA said there was no reference to service tax in the sale-cum-construction agreement in respect of the buyer, expect for the mention in the allotment letter.</p>
