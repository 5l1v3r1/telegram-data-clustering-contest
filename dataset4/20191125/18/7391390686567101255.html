      <p>Your Black Friday shopping list may feel like a never-ending compilation of all your favorites brands, but there's another one you need to add. <a href="https://www2.hm.com/en_us/seasonal/black-friday.html">H&amp;M's Black Friday Sale </a>has been announced, and the affordable brand is about to get even more cost-effective this shopping holiday. The deal is so good that it'll likely sky rocket to the top of your nice list.</p>
      <p>According to the H&amp;M website, the 2019 Black Friday deal will give customers 30% off site wide and free shipping. While some deals begin well before the official start of <a href="https://www.bustle.com/black-friday">Black Friday</a>, that's not the case with H&amp;M. You'll want to make sure you save space to shop beginning Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday itself. Everything from women's and men's apparel to home goods qualify for the 30% off discount, so whatever you need, H&amp;M has it on sale.</p>
      <p>Of course all <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-best-black-friday-cyber-monday-clothing-shoes-accessories-sales-you-cant-miss-19348002">Black Friday sales</a> offer quality deals, but H&amp;M's already affordable pricing sets it apart from other brands. With such a large percentage off, H&amp;M lovers can snag dresses for just $21, jeans for $14, and jackets and coats for under $50. If you need to stock up on winter must-haves, the H&amp;M Black Friday deal is the time to do so.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The 30% off deal is consistent with the offer that H&amp;M gave customers last year. Like many brands (here's looking at you, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/old-navys-black-friday-sale-will-offer-50-off-everything-19305775">Old Navy</a>), customers can count on H&amp;M's Black Friday sale to bring them quality clothing at affordable prices. However, the brand has something others don't: high-end collaborations.</p>
      <p>H&amp;M on YouTube</p>
      <p>In Nov. 2019, the <a href="https://www2.hm.com/en_us/life/culture/inside-h-m/giambattista-valli-hm-designer-collaboration-collection-2019.html">Giambattista Valli collection with H&amp;M</a> launched to overwhelming sales. With stars like Kendall Jenner, H.E.R., and Alexa Demie attending and walking in the show, the launch and prior runway show in Rome was star-studded, and fans responded. However, not everything from the <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/11/giambattista-valli-is-collaborating-with-h-and-m.html">collection has sold out</a> on the H&amp;M site, and according to the brand's website, there are currently no exceptions listed for the Black Friday sale. If you've been longing for a Valli x H&amp;M piece, now may be the time to snag one.</p>
      <p>Bustle reached out to H&amp;M for confirmation regarding the inclusion of Giambattista Valli x H&amp;M, and pieces will be included in the sale.</p>
