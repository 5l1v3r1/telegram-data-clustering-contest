      <p>Transport for London’s (TfL) decision to not renew Uber’s licence today may come as a shock to its 3.5m users in the capital, but what does it actually mean in the short-term? Here is what we know so far:</p>
      <p>Can I still use my Uber app?</p>
      <p>

        <a href="https://www.cityam.com/tfl-bans-uber-from-london/">TfL bans Uber after a ‘pattern of failures’ puts safety at risk</a>
      </p>
      <p>Yes. Uber immediately announced it would appeal the decision, which allows it to operate until a final decision is made.</p>
      <p>The app was previously banned in London two years ago, but was still able to operate while the appeal was ongoing.</p>
      <p>Does the ruling effect Uber Eats?</p>
      <p>The ruling does not effect UberEats as it is not regulated by TfL.</p>
      <p>In any case, the decision to ban the app in London was due to passenger safety concerns, which could not possibly be relevant for UberEats.</p>
      <p>Will the TfL ruling effect Uber outside the capital?</p>
      <p>No. TfL only has responsibility for transport in the 33 local government districts that make up Greater London.</p>
      <p>Licensing for other towns and cities is the responsibility of local authorities.</p>
      <p>The app currently operates in 19 cities across the UK, including Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Edinburgh, Belfast and Brighton.</p>
      <p>Have other cities in the UK banned Uber?</p>
      <p>Uber has faced similar problems in two other British cities, however the decisions have since been overturned.</p>
      <p>The ride-hailing app was suspended in Sheffield in 2017, after it failed to assuage council concerns about the company’s management.</p>
      <p>The suspension was overturned and a long-term licence awarded a few months later.</p>
      <p>Brighton and Hove Council refused to give Uber a licence in June last year due to concerns over cyber security.</p>
      <p>It was overturned last December by Brighton Magistrates’ Court.</p>
      <p>When will Uber’s appeal be heard?</p>
      <p>A TfL source said the best indication was the length of the last Uber appeals process.</p>
      <p>“If we look at prior experience then it should be about nine to 10 months,” they said.</p>
      <p>“In 2017, the decision to ban Uber was made in September and the appeal was finished by July the next year.”</p>
      <p>Uber faced similar problems in Denmark and decided to pull out in 2017, instead of appealing new legislation.</p>
      <p>It was also successfully banned in Bulgaria and Hungary due to pressure from taxi unions.</p>
      <p>Vanessa Barnett, commercial lawyer from Keystone Law, said it was unlikely the New York-listed company would pull out of London like it did overseas.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“It will be interesting to see how Uber react,” she said.</p>
      <p>“However, given the amount of revenue Uber generates from London I would anticipate them fighting hard to make it work and not pull out like they did in Denmark.”</p>
