      <p>Speaker of the House of Assembly, Rt. Hon Monday Obolo-Bobou in Yenagoa said the Assembly has enjoyed unbroken stability and cohesion for almost eight years under the leadership of Dickson.</p>
      <p>Obolo-Bobou along with 15 members also denied speculation making the rounds that some members are planning to defect from the ruling Peoples Democratic Party, PDP to other political parties.</p>
      <p>He said the House of Assembly has had a robust partnership for almost eight years working with the executive arm of government in the development of the state.</p>
      <p>Rt. Hon Obolo-Bobou explained that three members of the party were absent at the meeting due to other official engagements in the interest of the state.</p>
      <p>He assured the people of the state that the House of Assembly was committed to ensuring that the Restoration Government finish strong come February 14, 2020.</p>
