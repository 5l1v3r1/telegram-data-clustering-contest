      <p>After a lot of hype, Prada and Adidas dropped their first collaboration with two limited edition releases. Talks of a collaboration <a href="https://twitter.com/pyleaks/status/1185232261618290696?s=20">first started in October</a>, and was finally <a href="https://www.elle.com/fashion/shopping/a29723408/prada-adidas-collaboration/">confirmed earlier this month</a>, with the powerhouse brands teasing a possible sneaker release on Instagram.</p>

      <p>The first piece from Prada x Adidas is a take on the classic Adidas Superstar sneaker, crafted in Italy by Prada. Made of full-grain leather, the sneaker has the iconic shell toe and signature triple stripes, while the Prada logo is emblazoned on both heels. The second is a surprise addition: a Prada bowling bag for Adidas made of calf leather with a nylon strap. Both come in the colorway Optic White.</p>
      <p>Adidas is no stranger to collaborations, working in the past with designers like Raf Simmons and celebrities like Kanye West. This is Prada's first collab with the brand.</p>
