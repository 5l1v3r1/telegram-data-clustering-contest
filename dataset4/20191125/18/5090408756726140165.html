      <h1>W Singapore allegedly told a teen's mom she'd checked out, when she was really arrested because her deodorant was mistaken for drugs, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:42:47+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:42</time> by <a rel="author">Jessica Lin</a></address>
      <p>An unlabelled packet of white powder can seem very suspicious, and apparently, that’s exactly what caused staff at W Singapore at Sentosa Cove to call the cops on one of their guests earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The incident first came to light when a Facebook user by the name of Stanley Paruntu took to Facebook to recount how his daughter’s birthday staycation had turned into a nightmare.</p>
      <p>The teen, identified on her Instagram account as Sharonia Paruntu, later revealed more details about her encounter via Instagram Stories on Sunday (Nov 24).</p>
      <p>In a statement released to <i>Business Insider</i>, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) confirmed that officers arrested a man and three women, aged between 18 and 19, at W Singapore on the morning of November 10.</p>
      <p>SPF said it was “alerted to a packet of white powdery substance, suspected to be drugs” in a room occupied by the teens.</p>
      <p>They were arrested on suspicion of possession and consumption of controlled drugs, SPF said.</p>
      <p>However, the teens were released unconditionally at 1.43am the next day – over 16 hours after police were first alerted about the white powder – when preliminary testing revealed that the powder found was not a controlled drug.</p>
      <p>Paruntu, who identifies herself as an Indonesian based in Singapore, said in her posts that after her release, W Hotel had initially charged her S$1,700 for the broken glass door. They later provided a refund. They also told her parents she had checked out of the hotel, when they first became concerned that the teen could not be contacted, she said.</p>
      <p>Here’s the story of what happened, as told by Paruntu on her Instagram account:</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The teen said in a series of Instagram Stories on Nov 24 that her friends had gotten stuck in the hotel bathroom. When a glass door broke as they struggled to get out, they called hotel staff for help.</h3>
      <h3>They were then offered a change of rooms. “The hospitality is nice, actually,” Paruntu wrote. However, at around 10am, Paruntu was awoken by knocking on her room door.</h3>
      <h3>Before she could open the door, two members of W Singapore’s staff entered with “seven to nine” police officers, she said. She claimed one of them told her that it was “just a random check”.</h3>

      <h3>According to her, police officers asked if they knew why they were in the room, to which she responded: “Is it because of the glass door?”</h3>
      <h3>The officers then told her they were alerted to a packet of white powder, which she explained was actually deodorant powder.</h3>
      <h3>Unable to prove that it was not a controlled drug, Paruntu and her friends were arrested.</h3>

      <h3>Paruntu said she was locked up for a total of 14 hours, and could not contact her parents. “I don’t want to share about what happened inside the jail, because it was really horrible,” she added.</h3>
      <h3>Seeing that she was not contactable, Paruntu said her worried parents contacted W Singapore but her mother was told that she had already checked out.</h3>

      <h3>But by the third call, W Singapore staff allegedly told the teen’s mother a different story, saying that she “never checked out”.</h3>
      <h3>The day after she was released, Paruntu and her mother went back to W Singapore to collect her belongings and complain about the experience.</h3>
      <h3>Despite apologising, the staff suddenly asked them to pay S$1,700 for the broken door, she said.</h3>

      <h3>After the ordeal, Paruntu said she was for a time afraid to see police officers, but had since gotten over the fear.</h3>
      <h3>W Singapore eventually provided a refund, but the teen’s parents have sought legal advice against the hotel, she said. However, she added that “W Hotel is too big” and questioned her ability to challenge them in a lawsuit.</h3>
