      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">WWE Survivor Series 2019</a> saw NXT squaring off against RAW and SmackDown in the battle for brand supremacy for the first time in the company’s history. The Black and Gold brand's Superstars headed into their respective matches as the underdogs.</p>
      <p>Lio Rush, Roderick Strong, and Rhea Ripley won their respective matches to give NXT the lead and the brand ultimately emerged victorious. Despite the entire hype surrounding the Red and the Blue brands, the NXT Superstars proved why they claim their brand to be the main roster.</p>
      <p>In this piece, we take a look at the five best performers at the PPV; 5 Superstars who stole the show last night. So, without further ado, let’s begin.</p>

      <p>The reigning NXT North American Champion <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/roderick-strong">Roderick Strong</a> is widely regarded as the best athlete on the Black and Gold brand. At Survivor Series, he certainly proved that those claims are not false.</p>
      <p>Strong went up against <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/aj-styles">AJ Styles</a> and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/shinsuke-nakamura">Shinsuke Nakamura</a> in the battle for brand supremacy. Ever since this match was booked, we knew that these three Superstars would engage in an exciting encounter. While some may believe that their match wasn’t as good as it looked on paper, I think Strong deserves credit for the performance he put up against two of the biggest Superstars in pro-wrestling.</p>
      <p>Strong did not look weak at any point in the entire duration of this match. In fact, he managed to outsmart both his opponents to seal his victory and bag a point for NXT. Towards the end of this thrilling match, we saw Strong rolling out of the ring to take some time to recover from the beatdown he had just received.</p>
      <p>This allowed Nakamura and Styles to square off inside the ring amidst thunderous applause. The Phenomenal One took down the Intercontinental Champion, but Strong immediately got back inside the ring and pushed Styles out of the equation. He then pinned Nakamura to extend NXT’s lead at the PPV.</p>
      <p>Overall, this was my favorite match of the evening and Strong was the main reason for that.</p>
