      <h1>Arsenal and Unai Emery: Loyalty admirable, to a certain point</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal could not have been more loyal with their underperforming head coach, Unai Emery. It is an admirable characteristic, but only to a certain point.</h2>

      <p>Modern football is horribly ruthless. Clubs are under more financial pressure than they ever been, especially those that are threatened by dropping into lower divisions, the demand for success, footballing and commercial, is greater than ever, and the sport is as competitive as it has ever been.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>All these factors have led to extremely harsh decisions being made. Managers are fired faster than they have ever been, players are bought and sold at the drop of a hat, and clubs more generally are always looking for the next development.</p>
      <p><a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=arsenal">Arsenal</a> want to buck the trend. Where Manchester United only gave their Sir Alex Ferguson successor a year and Chelsea seemingly replace their manager every season and the rat race to wheel out the same old candidates is repeated over and over, the Gunners have sought out continuity, consistency, loyalty and patience. It is an admirable characteristic of the club, something they should be praised for, especially in the modern era. And this is not just something they are spouting while acting in a completely different manner. The club is acting on their statements.</p>
      <p>Current head coach <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=unai+emery">Unai Emery</a> is under increasing pressure. Just four league wins all season, only two points from his last five matches, now only 25 points from his last 20 league matches dating back to last season, a lack of identity and attacking flair, his management qualities are rightfully being called into question by supporters and pundits alike. And yet, despite the growing mountain of evidence, the club continues to support their head coach.</p>

      <p>Speaking after Saturday’s 2-2 draw with Southampton,<a href="https://www.arsenal.com/news/i-have-responsibility-i-know-i-can-do-better"> Emery stated</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“The club are supporting me every day and also I have a responsibility. I know I can do better, I can take more performances with the players and I’m going to try to do that.”</blockquote>
      <p>Given the recent performances and results, compounded by the growing air of negativity at the Emirates and criticisms throughout the media, Arsenal are taking the most resolute and loyal path here. As Spurs have demonstrated, it is possible to move on from a manager. While their sacking of Mauricio Pochettino is extremely harsh, and likely the wrong decision, their clinical, ruthless, ambitious nature is to be admired just as Arsenal’s loyalty is.</p>
      <p>Searching for continuity and consistency is wise and is an encouraging manner in which to run a football club, but doing so in spite of the obvious evidence that suggests such continuity is not beneficial is not being courageously loyal. It is stupid. That is what the Gunners are currently doing.</p>
      <p>Being loyal, patient and resilient is admirable, and it is something that Arsenal should be praised for. But it can slip into stupidity, and regarding Emery and his future, the club is being stupid.</p>
