      <h1>IDF Confirms: Mortar Shell Lands in Open Field</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:57:48+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/hlj/" target="_blank">Hana Levi Julian</a></address>
      <p>The IDF has confirmed that a mortar shell landed Monday evening in an open field in the Eshkol Regional Council district after being fired at southern Israel from Gaza.</p>
      <p>There are no specific details on exactly where the shell landed, although according to a spokesperson for the Eshkol district, security personnel are searching for the projectile.</p>
      <p>The launch did trigger warnings on the smartphone application of the IDF Home Front Command, but the Red Alert incoming rocket alert siren did not activate, since the shell was not heading towards a populated area.</p>
