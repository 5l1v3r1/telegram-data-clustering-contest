      <p>Johnson was signed by the XFL last week to be the starting quarterback for the league’s Los Angeles Wildcats franchise.</p>
      <p>Detroit has discussed shutting down starting QB Matthew Stafford for the season and wanted Johnson because of his familiarity with the team after spending part of the preseason in Detroit.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old former fifth-round pick of the Buccaneers back in 2012 has played for numerous teams during his career that includes the 49ers, Browns, Bengals, Chargers, Jets, Colts, Bills, Ravens, Giants, Texans and Raiders.</p>
      <p>Aside from getting ready to play in the XFL — Johnson was selected with the No. 1 overall pick by the San Diego Fleet of the Alliance of American Football before signing on with the Redskins last December.</p>
      <p>He played in four games in 2018, racking up 590 yards, three touchdowns and four interceptions.</p>
