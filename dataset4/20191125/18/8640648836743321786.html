      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:09:04+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/staff/mark-anderson/" target="_blank">Mark Anderson</a></address>
      <p>UNLV senior cornerback Jericho Flowers was named Mountain West defensive player of the week for his performance in <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/unlv/unlv-football/ex-players-watch-as-unlv-wins-sam-boyd-stadium-finale-38-35-1899292/">Saturday’s 38-35 victory</a> over San Jose State.</p>
      <p>He intercepted a pass, recovered a fumble and made 10 tackles that included one for loss. One of those tackles occurred late in the fourth quarter on a third-down screen play that allowed the Rebels to get the ball back and drive for the winning touchdown.</p>
      <p>Flowers is the second Rebel to claim this honor this season. Senior linebacker Javin White earned the award on Oct. 14.</p>
