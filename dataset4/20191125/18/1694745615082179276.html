      <p>Gravy is a delicious part of any holiday meal, yet <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/How-Chefs-Make-Gravy-44092289">preparing it</a> can be tricky (there are <i>so</i> many ways to do it). If you want to up your holiday meal game this year <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Culinary-Institute-America-Demonstrates-How-Make-Basic-Turkey-Gravy-12091621">and not use gravy from a jar</a> or packet, it's probably easier than you think to make smooth, flavorful, delicious gravy to put on top of everything. With a little bit of preparation and using some easy kitchen staples, you can make the perfect gravy to accompany your meal. This method uses only five ingredients, and is delicious every time.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Get your turkey drippings.</b> Take the drippings (this is all the fat and juices left in the bottom of the pan) from <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/how-to-cook-a-turkey-46924869">your turkey</a> and pour them into a bowl.</li>
        <li><b>Add your drippings to a saucepan.</b> Be sure to measure your drippings. You will need 1/4 cup of drippings per eight people, so calculate accordingly. Heat the drippings until they're bubbling.</li>
        <li><b>Stir in the flour.</b> Add 1/4 cup of flour to the drippings, creating a roux. Stir continuously to avoid lumps.</li>
        <li><b>Add liquid.</b> Add two cups of liquid. Ideally, you will use more juices from the turkey, but in a pinch, a mixture of water, broth, and turkey juices will do. Heat this to boiling, stirring constantly to combine all ingredients.</li>
        <li><b>Season the mixture.</b> Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Some additional tips:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Taste as you go!</b> Don't be afraid to try the gravy as you prepare it, seasoning it appropriately. Depending on how much seasoning you used on your turkey, you may need more or less salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><b>Thicken it if needed.</b> If your gravy seems thin, don't fret! Add one tablespoon of flour to two tablespoons of water. Mix, and then add it to the boiling gravy, continuing to stir it up. Repeat as many times as needed to get the consistency you desire, but don't forget to add more seasoning to avoid a bland flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Strain for lumps.</b> If you've stirred your gravy and still come up with lumps, pour it through a metal strainer to catch lumps before serving.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By following this foolproof method, you're sure to have a delicious gravy that will be the star of the meal.</p>
