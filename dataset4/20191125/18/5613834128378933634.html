      <h1>New ‘GTFO’ Trailer Explains “The Rundown”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:09:25+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/theaxegrinder/" target="_blank">Mike Wilson</a></address>
      <p>10 Chambers Collective are still working away at their squad-based FPS <b><i>GTFO</i></b>, which is scheduled to hit Steam Early Access before the year is out. To get the hype train going, the devs have released a new trailer showing what’s referred to as “The Rundown”.</p>
      <p>The Rundown is basically the menu you’ll get upon launching <i>GTFO</i>, showing what your objectives are for the mission. As you know, in <i>GTFO</i>, players are captives in an underground complex who are tasked with a work order every time they log into the game. There’ll be different tiers, and the deeper you go into the underground complex, the harder the missions will be.</p>
      <p>Additionally, there’ll be a countdown timer for the Rundown. After the countdown ends, the objectives will be replaced by new ones, leaving the previous Rundown objectives unavailable. The goal is to provide a dynamic environment for players while also focusing on a common set of missions at a time.</p>
      <p>If you can’t wait, there’ll be an Ambassador Beta Test ahead of the Steam Early Access release. For a chance to be selected, <a href="https://10chambers.us10.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=641903374c86bfa00614750d8&amp;id=45ca76337f">sign up here</a>.</p>
