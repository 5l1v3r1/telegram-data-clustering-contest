And during the meet, Vijay talked about how he had a crush on Deepika and Alia. Pointing at Deepika, the '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Arjun-Reddy">Arjun Reddy</a>' star added that she got married and before Vijay could say anything further, the 'Padmaavat' star interrupted and said she (pointing at Alia) is getting married. Then Vijay went on to say that Alia is getting married.</p>
      <p>Alia quickly halted the conversation and said that why Deepika made this declartion. The 'Piku' star then realised that she revealed too much and clarified saying she just made that because she wanted to see Vijay's reaction.</p>
      <p>Well, with this, Ranbir-Alia fans are now waiting for the couple to make an announcement about their marriage soon.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, on the work front, Alia and Ranbir are currently in Manali for the next schedule of their upcoming film '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Brahmastra">Brahmastra</a>'. Helmed by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ayan-Mukerji">Ayan Mukerji</a>, the film has been slated for Summer 2020 release.</p>
