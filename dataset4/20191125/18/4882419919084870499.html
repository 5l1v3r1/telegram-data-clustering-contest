      <p>Barcelona centre-back Samuel Umtiti says he is completely recovered from the knee problems which have blighted him since France's World Cup success in the summer of 2018.</p>
      <p>"My knee is perfect," he told Marca. "I feel really good and I am only thinking about playing football. I feel good. I am working really hard and have been for months. I am looking forward to the return of the Champions League."</p>
      <p>With Gerard Pique suspended, Umtiti will start against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday as Barça look to book their place in the last 16.</p>
      <p>For the France defender, what happened in last year's Champions League has to be left in the past and the page turned as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>"Roma and Liverpool were two games in which we made mistakes, but we will not make them again," he added.</p>

      <p>Barça's objective is to win everything this season: "We are favourites in every competition because we have the best players. We're one of the best teams in the world and, for that reason, we have to think about winning every game, later, if we can win the Champions League, it would be perfect.</p>
      <p>"My dream now is to play football and I'm really happy at Barça and here in Barcelona because it's a good life."</p>
      <p>On his international teammates, Umtiti added: "Griezmann? He's a really intelligent footballer and he's really happy here. Dembele? I hope this year will be the year he explodes."</p>
