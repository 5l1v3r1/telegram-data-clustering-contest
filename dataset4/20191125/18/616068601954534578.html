      <p>A Kelowna mother knows all too well about the lack of addiction services in Kelowna.</p>
      <p>Both of Helen Jennens' sons died from drug overdoses – Rian from a combination of prescription pills in 2011 and Tyler from fentanyl in 2016. And while several years have passed since her family was forced to seek help, very little has changed.</p>
      <p>“Access to affordable treatment is next to impossible, we are so under-resourced in Kelowna. We have 10 detox beds, that's about a third of what we need,” she said.</p>
      <p>“You just have to look at the death count, it just mounts daily ... This city is literally dying, people are dying.”</p>
