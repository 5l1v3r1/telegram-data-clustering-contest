      <h1>Jason Derulo Denies Photoshopping His ‘Package’ In Instagram Post</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:48:16+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://collegecandy.com/author/shivanisx17/" target="_blank">Shivani Singh</a></address>
      <p>If you haven’t heard by now, Jason Derulo posted a picture on Instagram from his recent trip to Bali. The photo compliments his body specifically one specific part of it. The singer posed in his black underwear paired with gold chains and you can pretty much guess what caught the attention of many fans which got this photo to go viral.</p>

      <p>He casually captions the post “Good Mornin’ 💦” but trust me, the caption is not what Instagram users were looking at. His bulge in his underwear is very attention-grabbing. So many users were commenting on the post, and Derulo decided to have fun with it. Someone asked “What animal are you hiding in your pants?” he replied, “Anaconda.”</p>
      <p>He asked his followers to admit if they zoomed in on *that area*, and the comment received over 10,000 “likes” and nearly 2,000 responses.</p>
      <p>However, there was many speculations around whether this photo was photoshopped or not. TMZ asked Derulo to confirm if it was edited but he denied it, “Photoshop? Photoshop? Don’t make me [pull it out]. It’s not enough women in this area. Just know that us Haitians, we look different.”</p>
      <p>“It was in Bali. I honestly [didn’t] feel like that was going to be my most liked picture when I woke up this morning. I posted the motherfucker very early. It was [a photo] from months ago. It was not even something that I just did,” he added.</p>
      <p>Getting past all the photoshop allegations, Derulo had even more fun with the photo. He posted a photo of him and a fan trying to mimic the picture, exaggerating the size of Derulo’s underwear print:</p>

      <p>Unlike Derulo, the photo on the right is definitely not the real deal.</p>
