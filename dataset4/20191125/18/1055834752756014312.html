      <p>The huge collectathon that is Donkey Kong 64 was originally meant to be a 2.5D title rather than full on 3D. However, as we know that changed and the developers at Rare settled on a 3D platformer in the vein of Banjo-Kazooie, Conker 64 and Mario 64. The news comes as part of a recent interview with Mark Stevenson, the game’s former lead artist. Here’s what was said by Mr. Stevenson.</p>
      <blockquote>“It was a monumental task, a massive game, a massive amount of work. Also it was in development for around 3 years, the team that created DKC3 moved onto it after shipping that game, but about 18 months into development it was rebooted, the team was changed up with the leads on design and software getting replaced and the game changed from being a more 2.5D platform to what it turned out to be more in line with the Mario and Banjo structure of open 3D level that got a lot of reuse. The original plans of trying to recreate the DKC format of tonnes of A-B levels just wasn’t going to be feasible from a production point of view.”</blockquote>
