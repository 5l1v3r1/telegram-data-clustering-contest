      <p>Fans of award-winning quiz show <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/the-chase">The Chase</a> are venting on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> after learning they won't be seeing the Chasers again till 2020.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV</a> took the controversial decision to drop the programme from its scheduling, replacing it with Cash Trapped.</p>
      <p>Although the gameshow is also hosted by Bradley Walsh, and on its fourth series, viewers have not been impressed with the change.</p>
      <p>Now people will have to wait for new episodes of The Chase until next year.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter, @Jamiie_said: " Replacing #CashTrapped for #TheChase until after Christmas has got to be one of the worst decisions in the history of TV decisions."</p>
      <p>Another, @snakecharmer888 said: " ITV just isn't the same without #thechase"</p>
      <p>A third, @JackSpa36001909 said: " What is this show doing for the ratings? Compared to the chase. #CashTrapped"</p>
      <p>A fourth, @MissSarrah said: "Bring back The Chase."</p>
      <p>But there is also good news for The Chase fans as ITV announced it is now looking for contestants for the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv-chase-getting-new-show-17293133">new spin-off show Beat The Chasers.</a></p>
      <p>It will be the first time Mark "The Beast" Labbett, Paul "The Sinnerman" Sinha, Anne "The Governess" Hegerty, Shaun "The Dark Destroyer" Wallace and Jenny "The Vixen" Ryan have worked together on screen.</p>
      <p>Beat The Chasers has been developed by Potato, the team behind <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/the-chase">The Chase</a> and a part of ITV Studios.</p>
      <p>The announcement comes after the show won the gong for best quiz at the National Television Awards 2019.</p>
      <p>Hegerty also appeared on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2018 while Ryan competed on the X Factor: Celebrity this autumn.</p>
      <p>In May this year Sinha was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at the age of 49, announcing his intention to continue appearing on The Chase.</p>
      <p>Bradley said: "The contestants are brave facing one Chaser, let alone all five.</p>
      <p>"With that group of top quizzing brains working as a team, it's going to take some beating. But I can't wait to see who's going to take them on."</p>
      <p>ITV's head of entertainment Katie Rawcliffe said: "It's so exciting to be expanding the award-winning The Chase format.</p>
      <p>"Chasers and contestants alike will really need to hold their nerve to come out victorious in this new spin on the quizzing format."</p>
      <p>Potato's managing director Michael Kelpie said: "For quiz fans, this is the equivalent of competing in the Olympics or playing in an FA Cup final.</p>
      <p>"It's the ultimate challenge against the greatest quiz team ever assembled.</p>
      <p>"In this brand new format, anyone who thinks they're clever enough can take on the nation's favourite quizzers."</p>
      <p>The series will be stripped across a week next year.</p>
