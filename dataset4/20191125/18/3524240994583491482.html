      <h1>VIDEO: Anthony Joshua lands in Saudi Arabia for Ruiz rematch</h1>

      <p>Boxer, Anthony Joshua, has landed in Saudi Arabia ahead of his rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr on December 7.</p>
      <p>Joshua shared the video of his arrival in the middle east country on Sunday.</p>
      <p>In the video, Joshua was seen fist-bumping his fans as he arrived at the airport.</p>
      <p>It would be recalled that RuizÂ dropped Joshua multiple times in New York earlier this year, leading to promoter Eddie Hearn invoking the immediate rematch clause.</p>
      <p>Joshua is the favourite to win this rematch. Also, the duo has been engaging in a lot of psychological warfare ahead of their time in the ring.</p>
