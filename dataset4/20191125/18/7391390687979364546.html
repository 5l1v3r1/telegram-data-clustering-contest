      <p>Forget all of those cute photos comparing the youngest member of the Teigen-Legend family to his famous dad, because <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/1198802929353777154">Chrissy Teigen just turned Miles into a meme</a>. And it's not nearly so wholesome. On Sunday, the <i>Cravings</i> author posted a picture of little <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/disaster-girl">Miles in full Disaster Girl meme mode</a> on Twitter — you know the meme, the one with a young girl smiling menacingly as a house burns down behind her. In the photo, Miles appears to be at an airport looking over his shoulder with a sly expression on his face as a yellow flare streams through the sky in the distance.</p>
      <p>Teigen made the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/luna-miles-are-basically-chrissy-teigen-john-legends-twins-in-this-adorable-new-photo-15520184">connection between Miles and the Disaster Girl meme</a>, and then shared side-by-side images of the two adorable kids looking very <i>Firestarter</i>-esque. The <i>Lip Sync Battle</i> co-host's Twitter followers responded by taking the meme and running with it. Soon, <a href="https://twitter.com/Allthelxvesm/status/1198807117848875008">Miles had replaced Disaster Girl</a>, been blamed for the downfall of the <a href="https://twitter.com/fineparadox/status/1198811488191946757">Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade Pikachu</a> balloon, and defended <a href="https://twitter.com/ilovepie84/status/1198932065162551296">John Legend's honor as <i>People</i>'s Sexiest Man Alive</a>. And his mom is not at all sure what's she wrought. She captioned her initial Tweet "Oh no," and upon seeing <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/1198819758788890626">Miles edited into the original meme</a>, she responded, "my bear nooooo."</p>

      <p>Despite the cookbook author's faux horror, Miles' Disaster Boy spin on the meme appears to be a hit. Even <a href="https://twitter.com/ZoeRoth8/status/1198818220318306305">the original Disaster Girl</a> gave Teigen's little boy her stamp of approval. The now teenage <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/07/116732/who-is-disaster-girl-meme">Zoe Rath, who achieved notoriety</a> thanks to her dad snapping a photo of her at a fire safety demonstration, commented, "hello chrissy teigen i am the child from that picture. love to see it."</p>
      <p>While Miles' burgeoning career as a meme superstar is off to an impressive start, his sister, <a href="https://twitter.com/stephfay_/status/1194078750612316161?">Luna, beat him to the meme recreation</a> action by a few days. No, Luna hasn't channeled her inner Disaster Girl, but it turns out she can do a spot on impression of her mom. Earlier this month, Legend took both kids with him to work at <i>The Voic</i>e, and neither of them was impressed. But <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/luna-already-perfected-chrissy-teigens-cringe-face-based-on-this-hilarious-side-by-side-photo-17858009">Luna showed her displeasure</a> by making the same awards show <a href="https://www.etonline.com/chrissy-teigens-daughter-luna-channels-her-amazing-awards-show-face-at-the-voice-with-dad-john">cringe-face that Teigen made iconic</a> at the 2018 Emmys.</p>

      <p>Whether they're keeping it in the family or taking on a famous meme, Miles and Luna's status as internet legends is unquestionable at this point.</p>
