      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:17:13+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:17</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Bartlett, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nicola-bartlett/</a></address>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has defended giving money to the women hit by pension changes as a "moral debt" owed by the country.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> leader hit out at the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> and Tories for shedding "crocodile tears" about the women's plight after they inflicted the "con" on women born in the 1950s.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn was warmly welcomed by a group of so-called WASPI women in Renishaw, Derbyshire who thanked Labour for listening to them.</p>
      <p>Over the weekend the party announced that the 3.8m women affected will receive up to £31,300 each</p>
      <p>Liz Topley, 65, told the Mirror: "I was gobsmacked when I heard because we've been waiting for so long.</p>
      <p>"There was more coverage yesterday than there has been in the last five years.</p>
      <p>"And it takes someone like <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> to bring it to the fore."</p>
      <p>She added: “Women are seen as a soft touch. If they'd done it to thee men they wouldn't have stood for it."</p>

      <p>Pauline Snaith 66 said: "It is so soul destroying feeling like you're being ignored."</p>
      <p>Dressed in their now characteristic purple and suffragette-style sashes and with hand knitted hats in yellow and black stripes the campaigners told Mr Corbyn how they had missed out because of the change with one of the women losing £60,000.</p>
      <p>One woman was close to tears as she spoke to the Labour leader.</p>
      <p>Pauline Snaith, 66, who was made redundant explained how angry she felt  <br/>The party say the money, which was announced after the launch of their manifesto and its costings, would come from contingency funding.</p>
      <p>But the independent think tank the Institute for Fiscal studies says the pledge, which will cost £58bn "drives a coach and horses immediately through the manifesto pledge to get to current budget surplus to remain at current budget balance”.</p>

      <p>The money will come from government contingency funding.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader agreed that it is a lot more money than normally comes from contingency money but said “it's over a longer period is set it's not only paid in one year.</p>
      <p>He conceded that "contingency funds rely on the government getting the income from taxation and if course if it wishes to from borrowing.</p>
      <p>"We owe a debt to these women they were misled they lost a lot of money."</p>
      <p>He added: "They're very angry about the way they have been treated this is righting a wrong that society has done to them - it has got to be put right."</p>
      <p>"It's a type of process, although clearly exceptions have been looked at, particularly, for example, sadly some woman have got life threatening conditions clearly they have to get a priority and that will be looked at but I just think it has to be paid, and it will be paid."</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn added: "It is a moral issue because these are proud women, independent women who worked very hard all their lives, were conned quite frankly, and now lost a great deal of money and some are living in great poverty as a result." </p>
      <p>Asked why it wasn’t in the manifesto he said: "We wanted to develop a policy on it to work out exactly what the cost of it would be," explaining the party had always planned to make the announcement separately.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn is visiting key former coalfield town constituencies in a bid to convince wavering Leave voters to stick with Labour.</p>
