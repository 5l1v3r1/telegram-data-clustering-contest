          <b>Manchester United chief Ed Woodward was snapped having a heated debate with Alex Ferguson during the club’s 3-3 Premier League draw with Sheffield United on Sunday.</b>

      </p>
      <p>And, now, a body language expert has opened up on the incident.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.buzz.ie/football/united-fans-ed-woodward-alex-ferguson-344105"><b><i>Manchester United fans flocked to social media on Sunday night to vent their fury at Woodward</i></b></a>, expressing their outrage at how he was seemingly talking to Ferguson.</p>
      <p>Body language expert Judi James has opened up to The Mirror about what the exchange of words was all about.</p>

      <p>James said: “Ed Woodward's very animated body language here suggests he's making some extremely lively and emphatic points to Sir Alex Ferguson while looking less than in awe of the Man United legend, who has a reputation for making some fiery points of his own in the past.</p>
      <p>“The rounding of his cheeks and the slight pursing of his lips suggest overall good humour in Ed's approach but he is using enough signals of fight or battle here to suggest he's firmly standing his ground in the face of what could be any criticism from Ferguson.</p>
      <p>“The impression of a battle between the two men comes primarily from the way the pointed fingers are being employed.</p>
      <p>“This gesture is like an invitation to a 'duel', with the index fingers acting as weapon-substitutes.</p>
      <p>“In this case Woodward appears to avoid aiming any direct pointing with the back of the hand on top at Ferguson, which would form the kind of mimed 'poking/prodding' gesture that can often prompt an angry response.</p>
      <p>“The one shot where he is pointing directly he keeps his hand palm-upward, suggesting he's keen to win verbal points rather than engage in an angry fight.”</p>

      <p>She added: “Woodward's facial expression suggest total emphasis on his message, as though he could be responding to a criticism and keen to defend himself actively.</p>
      <p>“His brows are fully raised, his eyes are wide open and staring in emphasis and his mouth is wide open too.</p>
      <p>“There's a hint of humour in the slightly rounded cheeks here though, rather than suggestions of genuine, open anger.</p>
      <p>“Both men have activated their index fingers here, which is a bit like unsheathing their weapons. Ed's is pointed to one side though and Fergie's is dropped down, so this isn't toe-to-toe at this moment.”</p>

      <p>A second image shows Woodward pointing at something, with Ferguson following his gesture.</p>
      <p>And James said: “Woodward is frowning here and using a lip clamp as he directs Ferguson to look upward with another finger point. Is he pointing at the scoreboard? Either way Ferguson looks up to study it too.”</p>
      <p>United are next in action against Astana in the Europa League on Thursday (3.50pm).</p>
      <p>And they’ll be hoping for a repeat of what happened when they met earlier this season.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils managed to beat the minnows from Kazakhstan 1-0 with Mason Greenwood scoring the only goal of the game.</p>
