      <p>Paul Pogba has reportedly refused to play for Manchester United despite being fit in his bid to force January 2020 transfer move to Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>The France international has not played for Manchester United since he got injured in the Premier League 1-1 draw against <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/arsenal-fc-news-now.html">Arsenal</a> in September.</p>

      <p>Real Madrid were linked with signing Paul Pogba before the last summer transfer closed, but Manchester United refused to do business with Los Blancos.</p>
      <p>Paul Pogba himself confirmed that he will be glad to play under fellow countryman Zinedine Zidane who is the manager of Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>Italian champions Juventus are also reportedly to be monitoring the progress of Paul Pogba with the interest of resigning him.</p>
      <p>Earlier, <b>Legit.ng</b> had reported how former Crystal Palace chairman Simon Jordan made it clear that he does not believe that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can operate at the required level that <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1256247-solskjaer-told-by-simon-jordan-boss-manchester-united.html">is expected from a Man United coach.</a></p>
      <p>Last year when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer replaced Mourinho at Old Trafford, he started well, as he went some games unbeaten but United ended up without a trophy.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils even failed to make the top four finish at the end of last Premier League campaign and will not play in the 2019/20 Champions League.</p>
