      <p>Facebook today announced a new app called Viewpoints. Viewpoints is a market research app like Google Opinion Rewards and it pays you for participating in surveys, tasks and research. Facebook will directly transfer the money to your PayPal account. Facebook will use the collected insights to improve products like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Portal and Oculus.</p>
      <p>Here’s how it works:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Once you set up a Facebook Viewpoints account, you’ll be invited to join programs.</li>
        <li>Before each program, we’ll explain what information will be collected, how it will be used and how many points you’ll receive for completing the program.</li>
        <li>We’ll let you know how many points you need in order to receive a payment.</li>
        <li>Every time you reach that amount of points, you’ll receive a payment sent directly to your PayPal account.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is important to note that Facebook may ask for information like your name, email address, country of residence, date of birth, gender and location before allowing you to take the survey. Facebook also promised not to sell this app’s data to any third party companies.</p>
      <p>Facebook Viewpoints app is currently available in the US and Facebook has plans to expand to other countries in the future.</p>
