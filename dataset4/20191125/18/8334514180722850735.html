      <p>BISHKEK (Reuters) - Hundreds of people protested in front of the Kyrgyz government headquarters on Monday demanding that the authorities follow up on a media investigation of alleged money laundering to the tune of $700 million involving former senior officials.</p>
      <p>Kyrgyzstan, a close ally of Moscow and site of a Russian military airbase, is the most politically volatile nation in Central Asia and protests which turned into violent riots toppled two Kyrgyz presidents in 2005 and 2010.</p>
      <p>Published this month, the investigative report by several local and international media outlets alleges that a well-connected group has for years been smuggling Chinese goods into Kyrgyzstan and then channeling its profits out of the country.</p>
      <p>Kyrgyz private news website Kloop, United States-sponsored Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and a collective of European news outlets called the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), who jointly produced the report, said their main source had been a Chinese-born businessman who fell out with his former partners in the former Soviet republic.</p>
      <p>The businessman was shot dead in Istanbul this month.</p>
      <p>On Monday, about 500 people gathered on a square outside the main government building in Bishkek, demanding an investigation into the matter and the resignation of senior officials in charge of combating financial crime.</p>
      <p>Some carried posters saying “Return our money” and “Kyrgyzstan is not impoverished, Kyrgyzstan is being robbed”.</p>
      <p>The Kyrgyz government has said it was investigating the allegations made in the report.</p>
