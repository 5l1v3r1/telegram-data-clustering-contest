      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> fans have been reminiscing about one of the greatest goals in recent claret and blue history.</p>
      <p>Exactly 12 months ago today (November 25) Villa cult hero Alan Hutton charged through Birmingham City's whole team to score a stunner in front of the Holte End.</p>
      <p>It was the final goal during Villa's 4-2 win over Blues and a goal that Villans still love to discuss.</p>

      <p>And it seems that players who were on the field that day, are also keen to talk about their derby day triumph and John McGinn, as he usually does, has chimed in with the best response.</p>
      <p>Hutton, who is now a free agent after his release at the end of last season, posted the video of his stunning solo goal, with a number of colleagues quick to have their say.</p>
      <p>Glenn Whelan replied to the video: "Check out @henri_lansbury10 pull up with his hammy after getting out of 2nd gear."</p>

      <p>But McGinn's message will be the one that raises the biggest smile. The Scotland international had a little piece of advice for his compatriot: "Should've passed it Alan."</p>
      <p>It's a feeling that would have been going through every Villa fans' mind as he made his lung bursting charge, but as Hutton replied: "Why John it went in?"</p>
