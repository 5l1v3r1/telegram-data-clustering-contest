      <h1>PS4 Black Friday deals 2019 – the best offers on consoles, PS4 Pro games, PSVR, and more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:35:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:35</time> by <a rel="author">Staff</a></address>
      <p>Now that the week has started we’re beginning to see more and more PS4 Black Friday deals appear online. There are some huge bargains up for grabs if you’re looking to get yourself a brand new PS4 Slim or PS4 Pro console. And there’s good news if you’re after a PSVR headset, too, as we’re seeing some considerable savings on PlayStation’s foray into the virtual world. Any more deals we find will be added here regularly!</p>
      <p>It’s early days but we’re already seeing some considerable savings available. If you’ve been gunning for a standard PS4 then you can’t really get much better than the Only on PlayStation bundle that Sony announced a couple of weeks ago. A console and three games for $200? Sign us up! We’re on the hunt for some good PS4 Pro deals this year too, especially with the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/08/ps5-name-playstation-5-release-date-2020/">PS5</a> due for release in 2020. That might see Sony discount its more powerful box even lower.</p>
      <p>Of course, there are a lot of games we might expect to see for cheap this year as well. It seems unlikely that many major releases will get massive discounts, though a few bucks off here or there wouldn’t be too crazy a prediction. For some of the year’s slightly older games, however, you can definitely expect to see a considerable reduction. Will now be the time to plump for the likes of Borderlands 3, Control or Resident Evil 2 for you?</p>
      <p>There are a great many accessories and extras we have already seen reduced this year. We always see a <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/22/playstation-plus-black-friday-deals-offers-subscription-service-cheap/">PS Plus deal</a> for Black Friday and 2019 is no different there. And don’t forget about <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/25/ps4-controller-black-friday-deals-rose-gold-glacier-camouflage/">PS4 controllers</a>, too. This surprisingly expensive bit of kit usually becomes more affordable in the big Black Friday sales. Be sure to stick with us throughout the week so you’re always up to date with all the best bargains.</p>
      <h3>Today’s best PS4 Black Friday deal</h3>
      <p>
        <b>In the US:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Interactive-Entertainment-LLC-Call-Duty/dp/B07YLDNTKB?tag=vg247-m-bf-20">Only on PlayStation PS4 Bundle (1TB PS4 + The Last of Us: Remastered, God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition) for $199</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Right now, this Only on PlayStation bundle in the US is the best PS4 Black Friday offer thus far. For starters,  you get a slightly beefier 1TB hard drive that gives you loads of room for your growing games library. Plus, there’s The Last of Us Remastered, God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn – Complete Edition to get stuck into right away. This is a top trio of PS4 exclusives that are all absolute must-plays on Sony’s console. All of that at a terrific price, too!</p>
      <p>
        <b>In the UK:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Call-Duty-Modern-Warfare-Bundle/dp/B07YM1Q9S4?tag=vg247-m-21">PS4 500GB + Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Bundle for £249.99</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Playstation-Stranding-Standard-Exclusive-Amazon-co-uk/dp/B07ZW7JVKL?tag=vg247-m-21">PS4 Pro 1TB + Death Stranding for £299.99</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sadly, that incredible PS4 bundle available in the US isn’t available in the UK as well. Disappointing! In Blighty, you’ll have to make do with a 500GB PS4 with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare for £249.99. It’s actually been lower in the past so if you’ve been thinking of grabbing a PS4 then we’d suggest holding off for some better deals later in the week. The PS4 Pro offers aren’t too bad, though, and you can get a console with Hideo Kojima’s latest opus for £299.99. We’ll keep an eye out for any new deals throughout the week.</p>
      <p>
        <b>PS4 Pro deals</b>

      </figure>
      <p>At the moment, PS4 Pro bundles are very underwhelming in the US. The best we’ve been able to track down is this <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-playstation-4-pro-1tb-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-console-bundle-jet-black/6378621.p">PS4 Pro 1TB Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Console Bundle for $299.99</a> at Best Buy. That’s not a bad price for the set, but we could see even more deals arrive over the next few days.</p>
      <p>In the UK, though, the PS4 Pro offers are absolutely flying. Whether you want to pair the console with the likes of Death Stranding, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare or FIFA 20, then there are options for you! Check out the list of offers below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.shopto.net/en/ps4hw266-ps4-pro-1tb-console-p61734/">PS4 Pro 1TB + Death Stranding for £289.95</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Playstation-Stranding-Standard-Exclusive-Amazon-co-uk/dp/B07YM1VZLR?tag=vg247-m-21">PS4 Pro 1TB + Call of Duty: Modern Warfare for £299.99</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Playstation-Stranding-Standard-Exclusive-Amazon-co-uk/dp/B07WFQGJ8R?tag=vg247-m-21">PS4 Pro 1TB + FIFA 20 for £299.99</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>PS4 Slim deals:</b>

      </figure>
      <p>As it currently sits as our pick for the best PS4 bundle available today, it would be wrong if we didn’t feature the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Pro-1TB-Console-Warfare/dp/B07YLDNTKB?tag=vg247-m-20">Only on PlayStation PS4 Bundle for $199.99</a> right here. For that comparatively small price, you’ll be getting a 1TB PS4 with The Last of Us Remastered, God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn – Complete Edition. Those are three terrific games to get your PS4 library up and running super-quick.</p>
      <p>Pop across the pond to the UK and you’ll find a couple of PS4 Slim consoles that are supposedly on offer. There’s a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Call-Duty-Modern-Warfare-Bundle/dp/B07YM1Q9S4?tag=vg247-m-20">PS4 500GB + Call of Duty Modern Warfare Bundle for £249.99</a> and <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/2073389">PS4 500GB + FIFA 20 Bundle for £249.99</a>. You might want to hold off on a purchase for now, though, as these aren’t exactly tempting prices for the smaller console.</p>
      <p>
        <b>PSVR deals:</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.vg247.com/current//2019/11/psvr-black-friday-600x338.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It’s great news if you’re looking for a PSVR deal in the US. Sony has dropped both the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Playstation-Bundle-Five-Game-Pack-4/dp/B07YLD3SHM?tag=vg247-m-bf-20">PSVR Mega Pack to $199.99</a> – that features Astro Bot Rescue Mission, Skyrim VR, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, Everybody’s Golf VR and PlayStation VR Worlds. Alternatively, there’s a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-VR-Blood-Everybodys-Bundle/dp/B07R4XM477?tag=vg247-m-bf-20">PSVR with Blood &amp; Truth and Everybody’s Golf Bundle for $249.99</a>. That higher price tag is due to the addition of the PS Move controllers, that’ll usually set you back around $100.</p>
      <p>Sadly, there’s no sign of any PSVR deals in the UK just yet. That said, you might want to keep your eye on the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/PlayStation-VR-Mega-Pack-PS4/dp/B07XYCQX58?tag=vg247-m-bf-21">New PlayStation VR Mega Pack</a> as if anything is going to go on sale for Black Friday this year it’s probably going to be this!</p>

      <p>As always seems to happen around Black Friday, you can find a reduction in a PS Plus subscription wherever you look. In the US it’s down to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Membership-Digital/dp/B004RMK5QG?tag=vg247-m-us-20">$44.99</a>, whereas in the UK you’re looking at paying <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/PlayStation-Plus-Membership-Download-account/dp/B00GUXZTAC?tag=vg247-m-21">£37.49</a>.</p>
      <p>On top of that, you’ll find a vast range of games on offer. You can browse the list below for some of the highlights on top PS4 exclusives and major releases that we thought were worth picking out:</p>

      <p>And we couldn’t possibly forget about accessories too, could we! It’s looking like now is a great time to get yourself a brand new PS4 controller over in the US as all <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DualShock-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-Black-4/dp/B01LWVX2RG?tag=vg247-m-us-20">Dualshock varieties are just $38.99 at Amazon</a>.</p>

      <h4>Should I get a PS4 or a PS4 Pro?</h4>
      <p>It’s the big question facing many looking to pick up a PlayStation 4 console this Black Friday. Is it worth grabbing a cheaper PS4 Slim or should you cough up the extra money and plump for a PS4 Pro? Essentially, your decision may come down as to whether you own or are going to buy a 4K TV or not. The biggest additional feature that you gain from picking up a PS4 Pro is that you can play games in the higher 4K resolution, something standard HD TVs cannot do. If you want the games you play to look the best they possibly can – and you have the TV tech to support it – then the Pro is the one for you.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.vg247.com/current//2018/11/ps4-vs-ps4-pro-black-friday-600x338.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>For everyone else: whether that extra graphical bump isn’t such a major concern or it’s your first foray into the world of console gaming – then a PS4 Slim will do you just fine. It’ll play all the same games a PS4 Pro can while saving you £100 or more off the asking price.</p>
      <p>That said, you can still use some of the PS4 Pro’s power while plugged into an HD TV. The Supersampling Mode, added in the PS4’s 5.50 firmware update, will render your games at a higher resolution to give the impression that they are running on a 4K display. Obviously, it’s not a true representation of a 4K image, but it’ll give you a bit of a visual bump. If you are considering an upgrade to a 4K TV soon too, you may want to future proof yourself with a PS4 Pro – at least for the next few years down the line.</p>
      <h4>Wait, isn’t the PS5 out soon?</h4>
      <p>That depends on your definition of soon. We now know that the<a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/08/ps5-name-playstation-5-release-date-2020/"> PS5 will be launching in 2020&lt;</a>, though it’ll be towards the end of the year. So, you’ve probably got a good 12 months until the next generation arrives.</p>
      <p>If you’re looking to pick up a PS4 this Black Friday, though, that could work in your favour. As this will likely be the last major sales event before the launch of the PS5 we could see some terrific PS4 deals to shift all the remaining consoles.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KTDETYChogU" width="500" height="281" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>&gt;Don’t expect a dramatic stock clearance price just yet, but picking up a console can make it easier to take advantage of dropping PS4 game prices as the PS5 gets closer to release.</p>
      <h3>What will the best PS4 Black Friday deals be this year?</h3>
      <p>It looks like the big PS4 Black Friday bundle is going to be this <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-playstation-4-1tb-only-on-playstation-console-bundle-jet-black/6380812.p">1TB PS4 with God of War, The Last of Us Remastered and Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition for $199.99</a>. That’s an incredibly good price for a brand new console and three of the best PS4 games currently available.</p>
      <p>If you’re looking for a PS4 Pro instead, though, Sony has announced that the system will be $100 off for Black Friday. Retailers are probably going to sweeten that deal with bundling some games with the Pro, so keep your eyes out!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.vg247.com/current//2018/11/psvr-black-friday-2019-deal-600x338.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>We were already very interested to see what would happen with<a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/09/sony-patent-shows-psvr-supports-bluetooth-transparent-view/"> PSVR</a> over Black Friday with the future of that technology up in the air as the<a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/08/ps5-name-playstation-5-release-date-2020/"> PS5</a> draws nearer. Sony is offering two bundles for the device. First is the PSVR Multigame bundle, which will include the PSVR, PS Camera, and five games for just $199.99. If you need the PS Move controllers, though, the PSVR PSVR Blood &amp; Truth + Everybody’s Golf Bundle will include everything you need to play the PSVR and two games for $249.99.</p>
      <p>And what about games? Well, the big end of year releases will most likely stick around their usual prices as they will have only been out for a few weeks.

      <h3>What were the best PS4 Black Friday deals last year?</h3>
      <p>The hot PS4 Black Friday deal from last year was a PS4 Pro with<a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/08/28/spider-man-game-of-the-year-edition-price-details/"> Spider-Man</a> for $349.99. Now that the more powerful console is selling at $399.99 with a game included as standard we should expect to see something ever cheaper in 2019. In the UK, a standard PS4 console with a single game was around £220, so it wouldn’t be too wild if a drop below £200 was coming.</p>
      <p>Other top Black Friday offers for PS4 in 2019 were some strong game discounts across a number of the year’s latest sports sims. They usually see a small price drop during that time of year as the season reaches its midway point. Elsewhere, titles from the PS Hits range saw even further reductions below their already very competitive price points.</p>
      <p>In the realm of accessories, it was controllers that stood out as one of the biggest bargains. These always seem far too expensive at full price so a few pennies off is definitely much appreciated – and we expect it to be repeated again this year.</p>
      <p>That about covers all the more interesting PS4 Black Friday deals from the past!</p>
