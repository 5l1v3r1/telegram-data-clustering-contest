      <h1>Ayrshire mum who piled on a staggering seven stone during pregnancy achieves dramatic weight loss</h1>
      <h2>Julie Charles' appetite while expecting had seen her give in to cravings for crisps, chocolate and takeaways.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:03:11+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:03</time> by <a rel="author">Eric McGowan, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/eric-mcgowan/</a></address>
      <p>An Irvine woman whose weight ballooned to 22 stone while pregnant with her second child has shed an impressive nine stone in just a year.</p>
      <p>Julie Charles put on a staggering seven stone during her second pregnancy, taking her to a size 22 before the birth of daughter Harlow.</p>
      <p>Her appetite while expecting had seen her give in to cravings for crisps, chocolate and takeaways.</p>
      <p>Julie is now back to a trim size 12 after joining Slimming World.</p>
      <p>She said: “I wasn’t just eating for two, I was eating for a whole family.</p>
      <p>“I was using my pregnancy as an excuse and, if I’m honest, I didn’t care how much I was putting on.</p>
      <p>“It’s only now when I look back that I see I wasn’t taking the healthy approach for me or my baby. Slimming World has totally changed my attitude towards food. I just can’t imagine eating like that now.”</p>
      <p>Three weeks before her due date Julie discovered she was suffering from pre-eclampsia, a condition related to high-blood pressure in pregnancy that can be life-threatening for mother and baby. One of the risk factors for pre-eclampsia is being overweight or obese.</p>
      <p>Julie was induced early to avoid further complications and baby Harlow arrived four days later on December 3, 2017.</p>

      <p>Julie said: “I wouldn’t be surprised if the pre-eclampsia was brought on by my size and that’s a difficult thing to acknowledge. I feel ashamed to think I could have been putting my life and my baby’s life at risk. I knew something had to change.”</p>
      <p>Soon after giving birth to Harlow, she decided to seek the help of her local Slimming World group.</p>
      <p>She said: “I felt absolutely determined. My consultant was very careful to make sure that as a new mum I was enjoying a varied and healthy diet to keep my energy levels up.</p>
      <p>“I felt really supported, not only by my consultant, but also by all my fellow members who were so encouraging. That really helped me to stick with it.”</p>
      <p>Julie rejoined her Slimming World group in Irvine in January 2018 and set herself a mini initial target of getting back to 15st and achieved a brilliant four stone loss in just seven months. It took another 20 weeks to lose the remaining two stone she needed to reach her target of 13 stone and she hit the milestone right before Christmas 2018.</p>
      <p>Julie said: “I had been so focused and it felt brilliant that all the hard work had paid off – I was beginning to feel like myself again.</p>
      <p>“At last I felt like I liked what I saw in the mirror again – I could shop for my age and for things that I liked rather than just buying cheap things in huge sizes.</p>
      <p>“More importantly, my energy levels were through the roof. I started going to the gym, doing three or four classes a week, and I also did the Couch To 5K app and started running.</p>
      <p>“I was determined to not be the person that everyone would look at as the fat mum at the school gate.”</p>
      <p>Changing her eating habits may also one day lead to a change of career for Julie.</p>
      <p>She added: “I really like the new way of life that Slimming World has taught me and I’m thinking of becoming a consultant myself one day, to help others in the way that it’s helped me.”</p>
