      <p>Speaking in an interview on Akoma FM in Kumasi, Strongman said : “Although the year has not ended yet, I would say 2019 has been the best year in my music career. I believe there are better years to come”.</p>
      <p>After his contract with Sarkcess Music expired, Strongman has gone ahead to win the hearts of many Ghanaians with his tracks and also won a couple of awards.</p>
      <p>It would be recalled that, less than a month after announcing the birth of his daughter, Strongman acquired a new house and a new car which he shared on his social media page.</p>
      <p>Strongman was recently in Kumasi to promote his new single ‘Mmaa’ which is targeted at treating women with the best of love and also campaign against domestic violence.<br/>Well, we wish Strongman all the best in his future endeavors.</p>
