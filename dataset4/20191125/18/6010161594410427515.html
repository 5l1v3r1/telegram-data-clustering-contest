      <h1>These PSVR Black Friday Bundles introduce you to VR at a discount</h1>

      <p>Is this year finally the year you’ll dive into the world of VR? Sony has two great PSVR Black Friday deals to take advantage of this year!</p>
      <p>Sony announced that two PSVR Black Friday deals were making their way to US retailers this Black Friday, and they’re already live at Amazon. One bundle gives you two games and everything you need to start playing with the PSVR, while the other provides five games, but you’ll need to buy the PlayStation Move controllers separately.</p>
      <p>Of the two, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Playstation-Bundle-Five-Game-Pack-4/dp/B07YLD3SHM?tag=vg247-m-bf-20">Playstation VR Bundle Five Game Pack for $199.99</a> is cheaper. The five games included are pretty great too, with the bundle including PlayStation VR Worlds, Skyrim VR, Astro Bot: Rescue Mission, Resident Evil 7, and Everybody’s Golf VR. It’s a great set to get started with the PSVR! However, this set doesn’t include the two PlayStation Move controllers that you need for some PSVR games. At Amazon, you can grab a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Move-Motion-Controllers-Pack-4/dp/B07B4BFC6S?tag=vg247-m-bf-20">PlayStation Move Controller 2-Pack for $91.99</a>, but if you really need everything, it may be better to grab the other PSVR Black Friday bundle.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-VR-Blood-Everybodys-Bundle/dp/B07R4XM477?tag=vg247-m-bf-20">PlayStation VR – Mega Blood + Truth and Everybody’s Golf Bundle for $249.99</a> may have fewer games, but it includes something the PSVR Black Friday Five-Game Pack doesn’t–a set of PlayStation Move controllers. Given how much the controllers are by themselves, if you don’t have them already this bundle is the best deal you could go for with the PSVR.</p>
      <p>Looking for more PSVR titles to go with your new device? Amazon US also has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Concrete-Genie-PlayStation-4/dp/B07NKVW3CH?tag=vg247-m-bf-20">Concrete Genie for $19.99</a>, which is a cool VR title to delve into. If you’re just interested in new PS4 game in general, PlayStation Hit titles are currently half off, with hit titles on sale like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nioh-Hits-PlayStation-4/dp/B07SVZL9XF?tag=vg247-m-bf-20">Nioh for $9.99</a>. The latest <a href="https://www.amazon.com/God-War-Hits-PlayStation-4/dp/B07XQKTPB2?tag=vg247-m-bf-20">God of War is also $9.99</a>!</p>
