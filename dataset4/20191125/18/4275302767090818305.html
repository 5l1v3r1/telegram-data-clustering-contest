      <p>Ryan Ogilvie, 31, admitted 15 charges of shoplifting and making death threats to store staff during the crime spree in July.</p>
      <p>Depute fiscal Charmaine Gilmartin told Perth Sheriff Court that Ogilvie – who has 72 previous convictions – particularly targeted supermarket vodka and aftershave.</p>
      <p>Ogilvie stole more than 40 bottles of vodka and was caught leaving several stores with a pair of bottles stuffed down his trousers.</p>
      <p>He regularly set off the store alarms by walking out the fire exits and issued threats of violence to security staff who tackled him.</p>
      <p>Ogilvie robbed the same branch of Sainsbury’s in Tom Johnston Road, Dundee, eight times between July 6-26.</p>
      <p>He also stole items from B&amp;M Bargains, Marks and Spencer, Boots and Asda branches in Dundee.</p>
      <p>Solicitor Ross Donnelly, defending, said: “He has been committing offences of this nature on a regular basis throughout much of his adult life.</p>
      <p>“At the time of these offences he was in the grip of a particularly voracious opiate addiction. He has struggled with that for much of his adult life.</p>
      <p>“Such was the grip that his desperation was such that he was almost indifferent as to whether or not he would be detected.</p>
      <p>“No real attempt or thought was given to how this would be committed. He was almost literally walking in, picking things up, and walking out again.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Pino di Emidio jailed Ogilvie for 137 weeks and said: “You are guilty of a series of offences covering a relatively short period of time.</p>
      <p>“In total there were a considerable number of theft by shoplifting offences. You also partially pulled out a knife and I treat that with more seriousness.”</p>
