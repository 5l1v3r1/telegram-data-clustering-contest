      <p>A grand public parade of MLAs from the NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena took place on Monday evening as a show of strength ahead of the crucial Supreme Court hearing on Tuesday. The three-party combine exuded confidence about proving the majority on the floor of the House.</p>
      <p>The political huddle in Maharashtra started after the BJP-Sena alliance came unstuck over the Chief Minister's position. The NCP, Congress, and Shiv Sena were in talks thereafter to stake claim to power. However, the situation took a completely different turn on Friday when BJP's Devendra Fadnavis was sworn-in as the Chief Minister for the second time with NCP's Ajit Pawar as the Deputy Chief Minister.</p>
