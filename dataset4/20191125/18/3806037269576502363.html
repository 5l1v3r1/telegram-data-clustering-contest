      <p>Towards the end of last month, <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/roddy-ricch">Roddy Ricch</a> teamed up with Gunna for a visual in support of their recent collaboration <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/roddy-ricch-start-wit-me-gunna-music-video">“Start Wit Me.”</a> Now, the West Coast star is enlisting <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/a-boogie-wit-da-hoodie">A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie</a> for a Christian Breslauer-helmed video in support of his latest <i>Please Excuse Me For Being Antisocial</i> single, “Tip Toe.”</p>
      <p>“When we first met each other it was just more so just conversation to understand where each other was from, understanding his perspective on how he was raised and what<br/>he was brought up doing and he just got to hear a little bit of what I got into and we just had a bond over that. And then it kind of just grew from that,” Roddy Ricch explained to Zane Lowe, opening up about the origins of his new collaboration with A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie for an exclusive Beats 1 interview.</p>
      <p>“I ain’t even really stepped into my prime at all. I’m really just growing every day. I’m glad that my fans feel like I ain’t really gave them that or anybody feel like I didn’t give them that, because they just show that I’m just on a constant progress … I just really just want people to just be connected with me as I go along this journey of my life. The album’s coming on December 6th,” Roddy Ricch added, revealing his next LP’s official release date. “It’s going to have a couple of features on it. I mean, most definitely. Me and Meek ain’t really had our time to really just shine on a record together. So for sure, me and Meek, we the only two on the song. I mean, coming from where he came from and just really stepping into the businessman role, for real, having that ownership and equity in everything he doing.”</p>
