      <p>A former lawmaker, Dino Melaye, has challenged the All Progressives Congress (ACP) to sue him over alleged vote-buying that reportedly occurred in the Kogi west senatorial election.</p>
      <p>Melaye, who is the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the Kogi west senatorial election issued the challenge when he was accused of vote-buying on Sunday, November 24, by Mohammed Onogwu, an aide to the Kogi state governor on Channels TV.</p>
      <p><i>“We have clips evidence where he (Melaye) was distributing money (voters) on the line where they were voting,”</i> Onogwu said.</p>

      <p>But Melaye who interrupted in laughter asked the APC to sue him.</p>
      <p><i>“What are you waiting for? Sue me,”</i> he said.</p>
      <p>Melaye, in turn, made a counter allegation that APC was responsible for the violence which he said claimed 16 lives.</p>
      <p>The former lawmaker said the PDP has evidence to prove that Governor Yahaya Bello and the APC were behind election violence in Kogi state</p>
      <p>However, Onogwu dismissed allegation linking Governor Bello, who was the APC governorship candidate, to the violence in Lokoja during the elections.</p>
      <p>The governor’s aide said Bello was at Agasa in Okene local government area with his convoy where he cast his vote and ensured that the exercise was peaceful.</p>

      <p><i>“These are fallacious statements that they are making to discredit the entire electoral processes, to discredit the entire institutions that were involved in the conduct of the election,</i>” the governor’s aide stated.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile,<a href="https://www.legit.ng/1278581-kogi-election-pdp-rubish-victory-kogi-state-government.html"> the Kogi state government has accused the PD</a>P of trying to rubbish the victory of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the November 16 governorship election in the state.</p>
      <p>Kingsly Fanwo, the director-general media and publicity to Kogi state governor who made the allegation in a press statement on Sunday, November 24, said the attempt by the PDP to rubbish their victory will definitely fail.</p>
      <p>The aide alleged that the PDP, through its propaganda wing, was attempting rubbish the well-deserved, hard-earned victory of the APC in the Kogi election.</p>
