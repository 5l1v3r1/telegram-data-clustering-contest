      <p>I'm A Celebrity presenters Ant &amp; Dec have hit back at 'fix' claims from viewers, which were prompted by Sunday night's live trial.</p>
      <p>Many viewers, as well as This Morning host Phillip Schofield, have hit out at the show after campmates were given a challenge which they believe was impossible to complete.</p>
      <p>Most of this year's <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> took part in the live trial, of course hosted by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/ant-dec-1">Ant &amp; Dec</a> , and they had to down gross 'shakes', hunt for stars and have a host of wriggling creepy crawlies dumped on them.</p>
      <p>For every star they won, they would win a roast dinner for a campmate. Earlier they had arranged everyone in order of who would win a meal. After faring well in the early part of the live trial, it was down to Roman and James to try and win the final stars but they struggled to get any of the remaining three.</p>
      <p>This left Ian, Cliff and Andy without a much-needed roast dinner and viewers were quick to vent their anger, saying that the last bit of the trial was "impossible."</p>
      <p>But, quoting a tweet from an incensed viewer, Ant &amp; Dec denied there was any wrong doing. The tweet read " There was no way anyone on this earth could have completed James &amp; Roman's trial in 90secs! Be fair &amp; feed the last 3 will ya #ImACelebrity2019 Shouldn't have had less than 3 mins on that."</p>
      <p>And the Geordie duo responded "The stand ins did it when we tested it," before agreeing with another viewer that the celebs should have tackled the crab part of the trial first.</p>
      <p>However, Ant &amp; Dec's assurances did little to quash viewers' frustrations, with one hastily replying "Most unrealistic time to complete a task!! Done it on purpose to cause friction in the camp!" and another ranting "That was so unfair there's no way it could be done in that time, the crabs were as big as the box! We want proof that the stand ins did it!!!!!"</p>
