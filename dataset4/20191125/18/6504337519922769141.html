      <p>Just one day after the startup laid off 2,400 employees, WeWork chairman Marcelo Claure was eating Michelin-starred pasta — and sharing it on Instagram.</p>
      <p>New York Times reporter Amy Chozick tweeted a screenshot from Claure's Instagram story: a photo of the $110 tasting menu from New York City restaurant Babbo with the caption "Pasta overdose" (accompanying wines with the tasting menu add an additional $80 per person). A <a href="https://twitter.com/BenjaminGoggin/status/1198274552293445632">screen recording</a> tweeted by Business Insider reporter Benjamin Goggin shows a video Claure also posted of the lavish meal.</p>

      <p>On Thursday, WeWork confirmed that it had <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/us/article/WeWork-cuts-nearly-20-of-workforce-in-14852439.php">cut 2,400 jobs</a> — about 20 percent of its workforce — after a failed IPO attempt that caused its value to tank from $47 billion to about $8 billion.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time WeWork has appeared tone-deaf in the handling of layoff announcements. Back in September, former WeWork CEO Adam Neumann somberly announced mass layoffs at an all-hands meeting, and then minutes later brought in Darryl McDaniels of hip-hop act Run-DMC to perform a set and <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/WeWork-CEO-reportedly-announced-firings-minutes-14450480.php">passed around tequila shots</a> to employees.</p>
      <p>Neumann stepped down from the CEO position at the end of September.</p>
      <p>Claure, the chief operating officer of SoftBank (one of WeWork's primary investors) was appointed the executive chairman of WeWork in October to help turn around the company.</p>
