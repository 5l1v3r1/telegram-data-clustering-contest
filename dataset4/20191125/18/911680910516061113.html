      <p>PHOENIX — Some 7.5 million people were expected to jam U.S. airports between Friday and Sunday as the Thanksgiving travel season officially kicks off.</p>
      <p>And that’s not going to be the worst of it.</p>
      <p>The Sunday after Thanksgiving alone is expected to see a record-breaking 3.1 million passengers take to the skies, according to a forecast from Airlines for America.</p>
      <p>“It’ll be the busiest day in the history of the U.S. industry,” said <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/search/results?q=John%20Heimlich">John Heimlich,</a> Airlines for America’s vice president and chief economist, in a phone call with reporters earlier in the week.</p>
      <p>In Arizona, the pain will come even sooner, with officials at <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/profile/company/org_ch_5bf88d7be694c02445e68099b7f1614e">AAA Arizona</a> and <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/profile/company/org_xx_23e5b6a6dba611e8bfb60e0374f60100">Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport</a> both saying the day before Thanksgiving is likely to be the heaviest travel day. People who wait until Wednesday afternoon for road trips could take four times as long as on a normal day, according to AAA.</p>
