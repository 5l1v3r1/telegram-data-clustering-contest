      <p>The fifth-generation <b>Honda City</b> sedan has made its debut in Thailand at the <b>2019 Bangkok motor show</b>.</p>
      <p>Due to enter Thai showrooms just before Christmas, the new <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/honda/city/">City</a> will go on sale across Asia during 2020. We're waiting to hear back from Honda Australia about local availability and timing.</p>
      <p>Thanks to its bar grille and the array of LEDs in the headlights, the City looks a lot like its big brother <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/honda/civic/">Civic</a>. Along the sides and at the rear, the new City's design is clearly an evolution of today's vehicle.</p>

      <p>The new City misses out on the simple, yet elegant dashboard fitted to the latest <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/honda/jazz/">Jazz</a> hatch, as well as its two-spoke steering wheel and digital instrumentation screen.</p>
      <p>Top-spec City models are fitted with an 8.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay compatibility and Bluetooth support.</p>
      <p>The car pictured here is a top-shelf RS variant which, as its name implies, is full of sporty styling features, including 16-inch wheels, red stitching, and a gloss black treatment for the grille, wing mirrors and boot-lip spoiler.</p>

      <p>In Thailand, the new City is only available with a <b>1.0-litre turbocharged three-cylinder engine</b> making <b>90kW</b> at 5500rpm, and <b>173Nm</b> between 2000 and 4500rpm.</p>
      <p>It drives the front wheels via a continuously variable transmission (CVT) with seven accessible virtual gears, and has a fuel economy rating of <b>4.2L/100km</b> in local testing.</p>
      <p>According the company's Thai website, the new City is <b>4553mm</b> long, <b>1748mm</b> wide, <b>1467mm</b> tall, and rides on a <b>2589mm</b> wheelbase. That makes it about <b>110mm</b> longer than the current car, but on a <b>11mm</b> shorter wheelbase.</p>
