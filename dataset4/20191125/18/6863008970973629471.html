      <p>Former Deputy Minister of Economic Development and Trade of Ukraine Yuriy Brovchenko has been released from a pretrial detention center on UAH 570,000 (US$23,700) bail.</p>
      <p>"My client is no longer in the detention center," Brovchenko's lawyer Serhiy Stretovich said, according to the <a href="https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/eks-zamministra-ekonomiki-brovchenko-vyshel-1574684838.html">news agency RBC-Ukraine</a>.</p>
      <p>The lawyer says the bail was posted last week.</p>
      <p>A number of restrictions imposed by the court in relation to Brovchenko are in effect now, he said.</p>
      <p>As UNIAN reported earlier, the SBU Security Service of Ukraine on October 22 detained a former deputy economy minister, who is suspected of treason related to causing large-scale damage to the country's defense sector. In particular, he is charged with signing a knowingly unprofitable contract with a foreign company for the supply of an artillery shell production line to the Artem plant for a total amount of over US$16.5 million.</p>
      <p>Kyiv's Shevchenkivsky district court late in October 2019 issued a warrant to detain him and set bail at UAH 3.4 million (US$141,667), but later the sum of the bail was drastically reduced.</p>
