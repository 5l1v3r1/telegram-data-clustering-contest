      <p>VANCOUVER (NEWS 1130) — Temperatures are set to dip in the Lower Mainland this week, prompting additional resources to be deployed to help people living on the streets.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Hunka with the Union Gospel Mission says the dip in temperature means outreach teams will be trying to connect with homeless individuals.</p>
      <p>“The dangers rise for people who are homeless or are out on the street and don’t have a place to go or a place to warm up. People face increase risk of anything from the emergency need from trying to get in from the cold to really complicated medical conditions,” he explains.</p>
      <p>He says in cold weather, shelters are often filled to capacity, leaving others to deal with the harsh conditions.</p>
      <p>“People die in the cold in Metro Vancouver and that’s heartbreaking to see, so it’s not an exaggeration to say that this can be a life and death emergency for people who are homeless.”</p>
      <p>Hunka says they have two rescue vehicles that will be operating during the cold weather equipped with hot food, hot beverages, and survival gear.</p>
      <p>He adds in previous years, shelters have overflowed with homeless people trying to get out of the cold, and some had to be turned away. This year, 100 additional shelter beds have been opened.</p>
      <p>The coast is expected to experience freezing temperatures from -5 to -10 degrees Celsius.</p>
