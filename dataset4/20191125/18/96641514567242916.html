      <h1>Elon Musk tells Ford VP 'bring it on' in F-150 vs. Cybertruck battle</h1>
      <h2>Tesla has faced claims its comparison was unfair.</h2>

      <p>At the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/21/tesla-unveils-its-cybertruck/">unveiling of Tesla's Cybertruck</a>, Elon Musk showed off a video of the low-polygon-count pickup defeating an F-150 in a tug of war. Since then, many have complained it wasn't a good comparison, since the presumably AWD Cybertruck appeared to face off <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/11/25/tesla-cybertruck-pulls-ford-f-150/">against a lower-spec RWD Ford</a> with nothing in the bed to help its tires get grip, and took off first.</p>

      <p>Ford X vice president Sunny Madra <a href="https://twitter.com/sundeep/status/1198988235252199424">responded</a> by trying to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/23/tesla-146000-cybertruck-deposits/">jump the pre-order line</a> and asking for a Cybertruck so his company could do its own comparison, and Musk <a href="http://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1199090292177006592">fired back</a> "bring it on." This could be more interesting than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/20/porsche-ceo-interview/">Tesla's battle vs. Porsche on the Nurburgring</a>, if it actually takes place anytime soon, and could depend on whether Ford brings one of its gas-powered production trucks, or that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/23/electric-ford-f-150-tow-over-a-million-pounds/">electric prototype it recently showed towing a million pounds</a>. The Cybertruck (along with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/22/cyberquad-electric-atv-cybertruck-tesla/">Cyberquad ATV</a>) isn't scheduled to start production until the end of 2021.</p>
