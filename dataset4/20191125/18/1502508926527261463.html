      <p>The price of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/onion">onion </a>is bringing tears in the eyes of its consumers in Bengal, with a kilo of the staple costing a whopping Rs 100 on Monday in some city retail markets.</p>
      <p>The vegetable not only scored a "century', its price shot even higher in a few markets.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/onion">Onion </a>had been selling at Rs 70-80 a kilo over the past couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>Traders, however, felt the price would hover around the present figure, if not at a higher range for a few more days, as the state's decision to import onions from Rajasthan and Karnataka to boost the stock would see on-ground effect only next month.</p>
      <p>A member of the state task force on vegetables said the situation has come to this pass because of the heavy rains in Maharastra's Nashik, which resulted in a large quantity of the bulb rotting following water seepage.</p>
      <p>Maharashtra supplies about 70,000 tones of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/onion">onion </a>to Bengal every month, out of the state's total requirement of one lakh tonnes. Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh supplies the rest.</p>
      <p>The onion supply from Nashik is expected to arrive in the metropolis in mid-December, when the prices would ease further.</p>
