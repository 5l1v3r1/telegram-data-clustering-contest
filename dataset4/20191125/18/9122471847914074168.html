      <h1>Nick Saban Says Auburn Is The “Best Team” Alabama Has Played This Season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:34:05+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Alabama is currently on the outside looking in when it comes to the College Football Playoff, and most analysts agree that the Crimson Tide will need to dominate Auburn in their annual rivalry game on Saturday if they want any chance of sneaking in. Nick Saban appears to already be campaigning for his squad’s inclusion.</p>
      <p>Saban told reporters Monday afternoon that Auburn is “probably the best team” that Alabama has faced this season. He also noted that playing at Jordan-Hare Stadium will be the toughest environment the team has dealt with.</p>
      <p>The second part is true. But considering Auburn is a three-loss team and Alabama already lost to undefeated LSU at home, it doesn’t make a ton of sense that the (Auburn) Tigers are the best team the Crimson Tide have faced.</p>
      <p>Analysts are accusing Saban of artificially beefing up the Tigers so Alabama’s potential win looks better.</p>

      <p>What Saban says doesn’t really matter. The selection committee is going to make its playoff picks based on what it thinks – not what any head coaches think.</p>
      <p>Alabama can’t win the SEC West and therefore can’t play in the league’s title game, so it only has one more impression to make on the committee. As noted, it will need to crush Auburn to have a shot.</p>
