      <p>Police look forward to seeing firearms owners in Palmerston North this week as part of the amnesty and buy-back for prohibited firearms and parts, which ends on 20 December 2019.</p>
      <p>Time is running out for those of you who have not yet handed-in your prohibited items and want to be compensated.</p>
      <p>You need to get online, notify Police of your intention and, most importantly, get to a Police-run collection event near you.</p>
      <p>Collection events will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday, 26 and 27 November, from 1pm -7pm.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Friday and Saturday, 28 – 30 November, the events will run from 10.30am – 3.30pm.</p>
      <p>All of the events this week will be held at Awapuni Racecourse, entry on Te Wanaka Road, Palmerston North.</p>
      <p>For those firearm owners who are still unsure of whether their firearm is prohibited, you need to get onto Police’s website or call 0800 311 311 to check.</p>
      <p>Don’t leave it until after 20 December 2019 to discover they are.</p>
      <p>This is also a good opportunity to hand in any firearms under amnesty – no questions asked.</p>
      <p>From 20 December 2019 it will be illegal to have any of these prohibited items in your possession - don’t risk prosecution and losing your firearms licence.</p>
      <p>The laws won’t be changing – so don’t hold out.</p>
