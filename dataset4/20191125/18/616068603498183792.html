      <p>The decision to change the speed limit on Commonage Road came to a grinding halt at council this afternoon.</p>
      <p>The motion to upgrade the speed to 70 km/h was voted down, and the limit will remain at 60 km/h.</p>
      <p>"If the speed limit is 70 km/h then you're probably going to end up driving 80 km/h," said Councillor Brian Quiring. "then you're just screaming coming into town and that's not safe."</p>
      <p>Quiring had support from other councillors on that side of the argument.</p>
      <p>"This increase would make absolutely no sense," said Councillor Kari Gares.</p>
      <p>There was a petition with over 300 signatures in favour of the increase, but the motion was ultimately turned down.</p>
