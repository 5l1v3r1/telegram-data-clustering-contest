      <p>Brodie, 29, has been out of the lineup since he collapsed during a team practice and began convulsing two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>The long-time Flame was rushed to hospital, but was released later that day. The team’s physician, Dr. Ian Auld, said after the incident that it’s likely Brodie fainted.</p>
      <p>Brodie has eight assists while averaging 19:13 minutes across 21 games this season.</p>
