      <p>Nov. 25 (UPI) -- President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a> will pardon one of two turkeys on Tuesday -- either Bread or Butter -- during the traditional White House ceremony.</p>
      <p>The pair are from North Carolina and made their <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/471902-turkeys-make-their-public-debut-ahead-of-trump-pardoning">public debut Monday</a>, as they were welcomed to Washington, D.C.'s Willard InterContinental Hotel.</p>
      <p>The turkeys will stay at the luxury hotel until Tuesday's Turkey Pardoning Ceremony at 2 p.m. EST. Last year, the turkeys were Peas and Carrots -- with Peas getting the pardon. As all turkeys do following the American custom, Bread and Butter will both retire to the Gobblers Rest farm in Blacksburg, Va.</p>
      <p>"They're very comfortable - - had a wonderful night's stay with us," hotel General Manager Markus Platzer said.</p>
      <p>National Turkey Federation Chairman Kerry Doughty said Trump and the first lady helped choose the turkeys' names from a list of about 15 potentials. The White House has created a poll online in which voters decide which will be famously pardoned on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Farmer Wellie Jackson, who drove the turkeys from North Carolina to the White House, said they were raised like any other turkey but were specially trained how to handle such a public ceremony.</p>
      <p>The White House <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2018/11/20/Trump-pardons-National-Thanksgiving-Turkey-Peas/8091542675177/">tradition dates back</a> to President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Abraham_Lincoln/?tps=1">Abraham Lincoln</a>'s administration.</p>
