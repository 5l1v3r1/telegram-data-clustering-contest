      <p>Nov. 25 (UPI) -- Defense contractor Northrop Grumman has opened an office in Poland, the first foreign customer of its air and missile command-and-control system.</p>
      <p>The 12,000-square-foot office, opened last week, is expected to allow the company to provide better service on what it sees as a major partnership, as well as to work more closely with potential clients in Europe.</p>
      <p>"Poland will be the first allied nation to acquire the IBCS [Integrated Air and Missile Defense <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Battle_Command/?tps=1">Battle Command</a> System] and will field it nearly concurrently with the U.S. Army, meaning Poland will get the latest technology and innovative product," U.S. Ambassador to Poland Georgette Mosbacher <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/11/20/northrop-sets-up-shop-in-warsaw/">said at</a> a ribbon-cutting ceremony in downtown Warsaw.</p>
      <p>The IBCS system offers a single, unambiguous view of a selected battlespace and offers significantly enhanced aircraft and missile tracking, Northrop Grumman said <a href="https://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/IBCS/Pages/default.aspx">in a statement</a>.</p>
      <p>In March, the company received a $713 million <a href="https://www.upi.com/Defense-News/2019/03/15/Northrop-Grumman-awarded-713M-for-missile-defense-system-for-Poland/5021552567222/">U.S. Army contract</a> for the production of the system, for the first phase of Poland's WIS≈ÅA air and missile defense program. The Warsaw office is intended to enhance the WISLA program of medium-range air-and-defense missiles.</p>
      <p>Poland was eager to obtain missiles after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, but it was not until 2018 it made a deal for the Raytheon-made Patriot missiles.</p>
      <p>The system to be used by Poland has yet to be fielded by the U.S. Army. A limited-user test by the U.S. Army is scheduled for 2020, which follows unsuccessful tests in 2016 that led the Army to reset the program's schedule.</p>
