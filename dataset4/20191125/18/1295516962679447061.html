      <p>Ever since his creation in 1974's <i>Marvel Premiere</i> #15 by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/iron-fist/">Iron Fist</a> has thrilled comic book fans, blending hard-hitting martial arts combat with bombastic superhero action all set within the Marvel Universe. Even if it had some <a href="https://screenrant.com/marvel-shang-chi-movie-fix-iron-first-mistakes/">noticeable flaws</a>, Danny Rand also starred in his own Netflix series set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe running for two seasons.</p>
      <p>Just in time for the character's 35th anniversary this year, we're taking a closer look back at all the classic outfits Danny Rand has worn as the Immortal Iron Fist, both in comics and in live-action.</p>

      <h3>Iron Fist's Main Costume</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Iron-Fist.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Iron Fist's original costume remains his most iconic, featuring a bright green color scheme with yellow accents on Danny's mask, belt and shoes. Largely form-fitting to show off Danny's toned physique, the exposed chest showed off the dragon tattoo the superhero acquired in K'un-L'un reflecting the source of his powers after slaying a mythical dragon and plunging his fists in its heart.</p>
      <p>The look would endure for the character with only slight revisions for decades after Danny allied with Luke Cage to become Heroes for Hire in one of the Marvel Universe's most dynamic duos. The character's various animated and video appearances would often feature a variation of the costume,  and it was even briefly referenced in the Netflix series.</p>
      <h3>Immortal Iron Fist Costume</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Ed Brubaker, Matt Fraction and David Aja's instant classic comic book run on the character, launching in 2006, had Danny slightly change up his costume to reflect similar fashion sense to a previous Iron Fist he met early on over the course of the run, Orson Randall, K'un-L'un's champion from the beginning of the 20th century who had used his chi-fueled abilities to remain vital and active a century later.</p>

      <p>While maintaining the yellow head mask and scarf, the torso featured an earthier green tone. With his chest no longer exposed, the familiar dragon tattoo was now a golden logo on the shirt's chest while Danny usually covered his hands and forearms with handwraps like a bareknuckle boxer.</p>
      <h3>Iron Fists' New Avengers Costume</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Iron-Fist-White-Costume.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Shortly after the conclusion of Brubaker, Fraction and Aja's run, Danny took up his best friend Luke's longstanding offer to join the New Avengers and changed his outfit accordingly as part of the Heroic Age, the brighter, more hopeful era following the defeat of Norman Osborn and his Dark Avengers.</p>
      <p>The yellow on Danny's costume was given more of a visible golden hue than its usual yellow, including the handwraps. The standard green coloration was now made a brilliant white to reflect the heroes embracing heightened optimism and idealism with some variations of the new costume either having a golden dragon logo or a black one.</p>
      <h3>Iron Fist's Netflix Costume</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Iron Fist finally made his live-action debut as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2017, where Finn Jones portrayed the superhero martial artist. Several outfits worn by the character over the course of his training reflected different comic book outfits but, by the end of the first season, the character had established his own look to reflect the grounded, gritty approach Netflix took with its various MCU properties.</p>

      <p>Worn by the character in both his own series and the crossover miniseries <i>The Defenders</i>, Danny completely eschewed the mask and scarf, instead wearing an unbuttoned, green army shirt with his exposed chest displaying the black dragon tattoo.</p>
      <h3>Iron Fist's Modern Costume</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Iron-Fist.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>When he's not wearing a version of his classic duds, Danny's current comic book costume blends several different previous designs as Danny reformed the Heroes for Hire with Luke while continuing to balance his civilian and superhero lives across his solo adventures.</p>
      <p>The main color of costume was reverted to its traditional green, though earthier like the <i>Immortal Iron Fist</i> era. The yellow color made its return, no longer golden as with the rest of the accents, while the handwraps were dropped entirely. Danny's chest remained completely covered, with the dragon logo now a uniform yellow to match the rest of the ensemble's color..</p>
