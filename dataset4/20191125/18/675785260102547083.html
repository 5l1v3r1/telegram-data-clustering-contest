      <p>Meanwhile, six lucky Brits have won big in the EuroMilllions so far this year in what has been a highly successful year for UK punters.</p>
      <p>Patrick and Frances Connolly, from Northern Ireland, won £114.9million on EuroMillions in the draw on New Year’s Day.</p>
      <p>Ade Goodchild scooped £71million in March and an anonymous ticket-holder bagged £38.2million in April.</p>
      <p>In June, a ticket-holder who chose to remain anonymous won £123million.</p>
      <p>Last month the country’s biggest ever winner was made when an anonymous ticketholder scooped £170million.</p>
      <p>The previous biggest winners in the UK were Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs, North Ayrshire, who won £161million in July 2011.</p>
      <p>Last week <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/lotto-winner-mickey-carroll-skint-20891585">we revealed</a> how 'Lotto lout' Michael Carroll blew his £10milllion National Lottery win on wild booze and drug-fuelled parties, as well as brothels and demolition car derbies at his luxury property.</p>
      <p>Now he lives in a rented flat and works £10-an-hour shifts as a coalman in Moray, Scotland- but says he's 'far happier now'.</p>
