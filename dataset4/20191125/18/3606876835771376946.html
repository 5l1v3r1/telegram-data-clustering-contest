        <b>Survivor fans are still reeling from the events of the show's <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29796869/survivor-dan-kellee-inappropriate-touching-reactions/">#MeToo episode </a>, and host Jeff Probst has promised that <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29869809/jeff-probst-survivor-metoo-misconduct-changes/">things will change </a>on the long-running CBS series going forward. Probst had <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/13/survivor-jeff-probst-island-of-the-idols-epsiode-kellee-dan/">previously explained </a>how the production team made sure to talk to each Island of the Idols castaway after Kellee Kim broke down and told a crew member that she felt uncomfortable with Dan Spilo's constant touching.</b>
      </p>
      <p>During episode eight of the show, <a href="https://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2019/11/survivor-meeting-producers-players-versions-differ/">an on-screen message </a>announced that talks had taken place with the castaways:</p>
      <p>"The following morning, the producers met with all the players, both as a group and individually. They were cautioned about personal boundaries and reminded that producers are available to them at all times. Based on the outcome of those discussions, the game continued.</p>
      <p>In addition, producers met privately with Dan, at which time he was issued a warning for his behavior. Producers continue to monitor the situation."</p>
      <p>However, in a recent interview, eliminated castaway Aaron Meredith contradicted what Probst and production say happened. <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29812795/survivor-sexual-misconduct-missy-elizabeth-aaron-apologies/">Meredith has apologized </a>for his role in the episode, but as he told <a href="https://parade.com/957139/mikebloom/survivor-aaron-meredith-eliminated/">Parade </a>, while production did talk to each castaway, the talk was brief and it didn't really help him understand the situation with Kellee and Dan:</p>
      <p>"Our 'production talk' came about 10 minutes before our Immunity Challenge. My experience in that talk was this: 'Aaron, we want you to know if you dont feel comfortable or safe, please know we are here for you. We want everyone to feel safe out here.' Very out of the blue.</p>
      <p>I thought to myself, 'Is this standard? Do they do this every season?' I have no clue. Just a very vague blanket statement telling me if I ever felt unsafe, I should let production know. Roger that guys, now can I go focus on winning immunity? There was never any indication that something was going on or that someone had issues. It just seemed like a standard halftime meeting."</p>
      <p>Missy Byrd also said something similar in her talk with <a href="https://parade.com/957469/mikebloom/survivor-missy-byrd-eliminated/">Parade </a>.</p>
      <p>In addition, fans have expressed that the choice to let Dan address Kellee at Tribal Council while she sat silent on the jury wasn't a good one, but there's some mystery about how exactly that went down, too.</p>
      <p>Probst told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/survivor-jeff-probst-speaks-dan-spilo-controversy-1254554">The Hollywood Reporter </a>that there was "great consideration" to let Kellee speak after she was voted out, and the host said he met with Kellee before it was decided to stick the rules and not let a jury member speak.</p>
      <p>However, Kellee told <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/19/survivor-kellee-kim-interview-island-of-the-idols/">Entertainment Weekly </a>that she and Probst "only spoke the day after Jamal got voted out" and that she was not aware that she could have had a chance to speak.</p>
