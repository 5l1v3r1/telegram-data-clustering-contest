      <p>As voters prepare to head to the polls on December 12, most of the UK’s main political parties have now revealed their plans for the country if they emerge victorious.</p>
      <p>Bold pledges on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a>, taxation, nationalisation, the NHS and climate change, have left Brits with a lot to think about before they step into the polling booth.</p>
      <p>With the deadline to withdraw from the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/european-union/">European Union</a> around the corner, this election comes at an important time in the country’s history.</p>
      <p>None of the parties can agree on the next best step to take as much as they see eye to eye on pretty much anything at the moment.</p>
      <p>Rather than leaving you to trawl through all of their election manifestos one-by-one, here’s a list of the top five pledges in each of the main parties’ manifestos.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <h3>Conservatives</h3>

        <b>Leave the European Union by 2020</b>
      </p>
      <p>The front cover of the Tory manifesto vows to ‘Get Brexit Done and unleash Britain’s potential’.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson has promised to ‘end the division and deadlock’ and to take the UK out of the European Union by January 31.</p>
      <p>As well as committing to no more Brexit extensions, the manifesto also says: ‘We will negotiate a trade agreement next year – one that will strengthen our Union – and we will not extend the implementation period beyond December 2020.</p>
      <p>‘In parallel, we will legislate to ensure high standards of workers’ rights, environmental protection and consumer rights.’</p>
      <p>But experts have warned that extending the implementation period ‘may prove unavoidable’.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Increase the number of nurses in England by 50,000 by 2023</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Tories say they will give the NHS its ‘biggest ever cash boost’ if they win next month’s election.</p>
      <p>Spending pledges include 50,000 new nurses, 6,000 new doctors, and an extra 50 million GP appointments per year.</p>
      <p>But reports following the manifesto launch on Sunday claims 18,500 existing nurses who will be asked to stay or rejoin help make up this figure.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The total cost of retaining, recruiting and training these nurses is expected to cost more than the £879 million in 2023-24 as claimed by the Tories.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Improve energy efficiency of social housing </b>
      </p>
      <p>Johnson has vowed to invest £9.2 billion in energy efficiency for homes, schools and hospitals in a bid to fight climate change.</p>
      <p>It is expected to benefit 2.2 million disadvantaged homes by lowering energy bills.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives say the £6.3 billion set aside for housing could save up to £750 a year.</p>
      <p>But experts say this is optimistic and would only be the case for homes with very out-of-date efficiency.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Make the UK carbon neutral by 2050</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Tories say they are aiming for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 by investing in clean energy and green infrastructure.</p>
      <p>The party says it will set up new international partnerships to tackle deforestation and protect natural landscapes and wants to set up a £500 million Blue Planet Fund to protect the world’s oceans from pollution.</p>
      <p>Also among its pledges is to invest £4 billion in research for new decarbonisation technology and flood defences and provide £500 million to help energy-intensive industries adopt greener techniques.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Create 250,000 new childcare facilities</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a bid to ease the burden of parents juggling work with raising a family, the Conservative manifesto promises a £1 billion fund ‘to help create more high quality, affordable childcare’.</p>
      <p>This would include care before during and after the school holidays for 250,000 more primary schoolchildren, in addition to the 650,000 currently benefiting from such schemes.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The manifesto adds: ‘Our vision for the labour market, in other words, is not one where the state does everything for you.</p>
      <p>‘It is one where the state does everything it can to help you help yourself – by upgrading your skills, or by being able to balance work and family life.’</p>
      <h3>Labour</h3>

      <p>
        <b>Nationalise rail, mail, water and energy and partly nationalise BT to provide free broadband for everyone </b>
      </p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn had pledged to ‘end the great privatisation rip off’ and save people money on their energy bills by bringing key utilities back into ‘democratic public ownership’.</p>
      <p>He says this will ‘put people and planet before profit’ where energy and water are treated as ‘rights rather than commodities’.</p>
      <p>The manifesto vows to ‘stop Crown Post Office closures and bring Royal Mail back into public ownership’ and to deliver super fast free broadband to every house in the country.</p>
      <p>But Julian David, chief executive of techUK, and a member of the government’s digital economy council said the plans would be a ‘disaster’ for the telecoms industry, adding that it would shift costs of investment being borne by the private sector onto the taxpayer.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Raise minimum wage to £10 an hour</b>
      </p>
      <p>Labour have promised to ‘bring in a real living wage’ of at least £10 for all workers, including those who are under 18.</p>
      <p>Corbyn wants to do away with varying rates for people younger than 25 and bring the highest rate up from £8.21.</p>
      <p>The party also pledged to create a new ‘Workers’ Protection Agency’ to enforce workplace rights, including the real living wage.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Abolish university tuition fees </b>
      </p>
      <p>Corbyn’s party has aimed to end the ‘failed free-market experiment in higher education’ by abolishing tuition fees and bring back maintenance grants.</p>
      <p>This is part of a ‘cradle to grave’ National Education Service which would also include six years worth of free education for adults of all ages.</p>
      <p>It comes after tuition fees were raised to £9,000 per year in 2012, which caused a huge backlash and a series of protests with students arguing they would never be able to get out of debt.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Build 100,000 council homes and at least 50,000 social homes every year</b>
      </p>
      <p>Labour has promised a house building programme of more than a million homes over a decade.</p>
      <p>A £75 billion plan aims to build 150,000 new homes a year – 100,000 of which will be build by councils for social rent.</p>
      <p>The party says it will ‘establish a new duty on councils to plan and build these homes in their area, and fund them to do so, with backing from national government.’</p>
      <p>
        <b>Create 1 million ‘green jobs’ to tackle climate change </b>
      </p>
      <p>In what the party describes as a ‘green revolution’, Labour has promised one million ‘green jobs’ in the energy and home refurbishment sectors.</p>
      <p>The party wants to shift investment to renewable energy, and rail and electric cars and to ‘fund the jobs and industries of the future so that no one is held back’.</p>
      <p>Under Labour’s ‘Green New Deal’ they aim to work with trade unions and staff to ‘ensure that they lead the transition in their industries.’</p>
      <p>The party aims to reduce a ‘substantial majority’ of carbon emissions by 2030 in an ‘evidence based’ way.</p>
      <h3>Liberal Democrats</h3>
      <figure>
        <video src="https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/backup/2019/11/20/2930540250688801843/640x360_MP4_2930540250688801843.mp4"/>

      <p>
        <b>Revoke Article 50 and stop Brexit</b>
      </p>
      <p>Written in big bold letters on the front of the Lib Dem’s manifesto is the message: ‘Stop Brexit, build a Brighter Future’.</p>
      <p>They say they are ‘unashamedly fighting to stay in the European Union, and we are the strongest party of Remain.’</p>
      <p>Party leader Jo Swinson says staying in the block will secure a £50 billion bonus and help the economy grow two per cent larger by 2024-25.</p>
      <p>But Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) director Paul Johnson says there is ‘a lot of uncertainty over such an estimate’.</p>
      <p>
        <b>35 hours of free childcare from nine months old</b>
      </p>
      <p>To ‘create a fairer economy’ the Lib Dems are pledging childcare for all children with parents in work up from nine months.</p>
      <p>This will be extended to all children from two years up to the age they start school.</p>
      <p>The manifesto adds: ‘This will plug the gap in provision, ensuring that parents have an easier choice when it comes to returning to work after parental leave.’</p>
      <p>
        <b>Recruit 20,000 more teachers and give schools an extra £10 billion by 2024/25</b>
      </p>
      <p>Swinson has vowed to ‘reverse school cuts with an emergency cash injection’ which is set to boost teacher numbers.</p>
      <p>Her party wants to reduce class sizes to 2015 levels and invest to clear the backlog of repairs to school and college buildings.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems also want to ‘end the crisis’ in Special Educational Needs and disabilities funding with extra cash for local authorities.</p>
      <p>They say this will halve the amount schools have to pay towards a child’s Education Health and Care Plan.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Introduce a frequent flyer tax</b>
      </p>
      <p>People who regularly travel by plane will be hit with a tax in a bid to cut carbon emissions caused by aviation.</p>
      <p>The party promises to reform Air Passenger Duty so those who travel the most pay more and occasional holidaymakers less.</p>
      <p>Money raised from the tax will be ploughed back into greener forms of public transport.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Introduce a £10,000 ‘skills wallet’ for education and training for adults</b>
      </p>
      <p>This money would go into a ‘skills wallet’ over a period of 30 years to help people pay for courses from an approved list.</p>
      <p>A Lib Dem Government would put in £4,000 at 25 years old, £3,000 at 40 and another £3,000 at 55.</p>
      <p>The aim of this is to give people help in changing careers or upskilling when they need to.</p>
      <p>They say they will pay for this by reversing corporation tax cuts and returning it to its 2016 level of 20 per cent.</p>
      <h3>Green Party</h3>

        <video src="https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/backup/2019/11/20/8877305564375200109/640x360_MP4_8877305564375200109.mp4"/>

      <p>
        <b>Invest £100 billion a year in Green New Deal </b>
      </p>
      <p>The Greens have announced a massive investment plan to help tackle climate change.</p>
      <p>It includes a massive overhaul of the fossil fuels industry and switch to renewable energy sources.</p>
      <p>The Green New Deal also includes planting 700 million trees within a decade and to upgrade household heating systems.</p>
      <p>At least £90 billion is expected to come from borrowing while a further £9 billion would be raised through tax hikes, including raising corporation tax from 19 to 24 per cent.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Reduce UK’s carbon emissions to net zero by 2030</b>
      </p>
      <p>The party says it is on track to achieving this goal through switching to renewable energy sources, reducing overall demand for heating and power and to transform how the UK’s industry uses land and transport.</p>
      <p>They say the public sector kick starting start their ‘Green New Deal’ will ‘act as a catalyst for private sector investment.’</p>
      <p>Co-Leaders: Jonathan Bartley and Siân Berry have even pledged to appoint a ‘carbon chancellor’ to help achieve their goal.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lower the voting age to 16, reform the voting system and introduce a fully elected House of Lords</b>
      </p>
      <p>The manifesto promises to scrap the UK’s first-past-the-post electoral system, which they say results in more than half of votes ‘not counting’.t</p>
      <p>They say proportional representation will be much ‘fairer’, as would reforming the House of Lords, which they say currently ‘gives power to people who have never been elected’.</p>
      <p>As well as lowering the voting age, the Green also will allow people to stand for Parliament and all other elected offices from the age of 16.</p>

        <b>Hold a second EU </b>
        <b>referendum</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Greens say they are ‘a proudly pro-European party and are unequivocally campaigning for Britain to Remain in the EU.’</p>
      <p>The party has committed itself to another vote and to campaign to remain.</p>
      <p>Staying in the European Union would ‘lead the fight against the Climate Emergency and to improve the lives of workers, low income families and refugees’, the party claims.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Increase NHS funding by £6 billion per year</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Green promise to do this until at least 2030 in their manifesto, which they say amounts to a 4.5 per cent increase on the 2018/19 budget.</p>
      <p>In addition they have pledged a further £1 billion a year in nursing higher education and a reinstatement of bursaries.</p>
      <p>They also want to ‘roll back privatisation of the NHS’ through repealing the Health and Social Care Act 2012.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Scrap first-past-the-post and the House of Lords and reform postal voting</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nigel Farage’s party says the ‘establishment conspiring to frustrate democracy over Brexit’ demonstrates the need for political reform.</p>
      <p>In a bid to make the voting system ‘more representative’ they want to reform the UK’s electoral system;</p>
      <p>They also promise an overhaul of postal voting to ‘combat fraud and abuse’ and to abolish the unelected House of Lords.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A clean-break Brexit </b>
      </p>
      <p>The party says a no-deal withdrawal from the EU is the only way the country can free itself from EU rules and regulations.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the European Parliament in September, Farage said: ‘Once we’ve done that we’ll have a grown-up conversation about trade and about the way forward.’</p>
      <p>
        <b>Reform the BBC by getting rid of the licence fee </b>
      </p>
      <p>Farage says the current way the Beeb is funded, £154.50 for every colour TV licence, is a form of ‘anachronism’.</p>
      <p>Speaking on LBC he said: ‘The younger generation, they don’t watch television the way that you and I did growing up. They choose what they watch, they pay for what they want to watch.’</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party leader proposed phasing out he licence fee gradually over time.</p>

        <b>Raise £200 billion by slashing foreign aid budget, scrapping HS2 and save money ‘not legally due to EU’</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Brexit Party aims to free up £40 billion pounds over a five year term by cutting the UK’s foreign aid budget by 50 per cent.</p>
      <p>When asked how this would affect Britain’s standing in the world, Farage said: ‘Well what we’ve seen over the last few years is us consistently be the highest spender on foreign aid. Doing it to meet arbitrary targets, spending it in ways that enrage many people in this country.</p>
      <p>‘I think trade not aid is where we should be heading, and I think as part of the European Union we’ve been putting these barriers up against African countries and many others from selling their produce to us.’</p>
      <p>The party also hopes to save money by scrapping the HS2 railway project altogether and by keeping the £13 billion annual contribution to EU.</p>
      <p>According to FullFact EU spending on the EU last year was forecast to be £4 billion meaning the UK’s net contribution would have been closer to £9 billion.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Investing £2.5 billion in fishing and coastal communities </b>
      </p>
      <p>Farage says a ‘clean-break Brexit’ will recover control of a 200 mile ‘exclusive economic zone’ around the UK’s shores.</p>
      <p>He says this will ‘create creating the opportunity to regenerate our coastal communities with new investment, jobs and tourism’.</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party leader says many seaside towns are in ‘left behind regions’ and could benefit from a significant cash boost.</p>
