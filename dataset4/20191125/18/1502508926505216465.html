      <h1>Beijing Subway introduces facial recognition system for security checks</h1>
      <h2>Beijing's adoption of the technology comes amid a global outcry over its treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang</h2>

      <p>A <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/beijing">Beijing </a>subway station is promoting a system that recognizes the faces of passengers and matches them to a database, as China’s adoption of surveillance technology gathers pace despite misgivings about privacy.</p>
      <p>Passengers will be able to use a <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/facial-recognition">facial recognition </a>gateway during rush hour if they sign up to the service by registering with a QR code, according to security officials at Fuchengmen Station in the west of China’s capital. Bags larger than an A4 piece of paper still need to be checked, they said. A representative from <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/beijing">Beijing </a>Ruubypay Science and Technology Co., which is promoting the system, added that it’s unclear when it will be rolled out citywide.</p>
      <p>State media reported in late October that the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/beijing">Beijing </a>Subway would use <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/facial-recognition">facial recognition </a>to help ease congestion on the crowded network, and that a credit system based on passenger behavior would determine the level of security checks they faced. That echoes a broader plan by <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/china">China </a>to implement a social credit system to grade citizens and award or deduct points accordingly.</p>

      <p>Mass surveillance technology has stoked plenty of apprehension. Even the tightly controlled Chinese media has raised concerns: <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/china">China </a>Central Television said laws are urgently needed to regulate and restrict its use. A court in the eastern city of Hangzhou last month agreed to hear a case filed by a law professor, who is suing the local safari park over a mandatory rule requiring visitors to enter through a <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/facial-recognition">facial recognition </a>lane.</p>
      <p>Beijing’s adoption of the technology comes amid a global outcry over its treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang, where the United Nations says upwards of 1 million of the ethnic minority Muslim population could be being held in re-education camps. Intense surveillance in the region forces residents to submit to facial scans when entering places such as markets and fuel stations. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/china">China </a>has justified the crackdown as counter-terrorism activity and says the U.S. and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-others-1160108.htm">others </a>should stop interfering in its internal affairs.</p>
