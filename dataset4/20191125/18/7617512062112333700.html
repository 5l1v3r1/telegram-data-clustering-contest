      <h1>Saanich councillors may ask B.C. to 'modernize' act governing speed limits</h1>

      <p>Saanich councillors will consider whether to send Premier John Horgan a letter asking for a “modernization” of the Highway Traffic Act.</p>
      <p>Saanich Mayor Fred Haynes said in a telephone interview Monday he believes a good look at the act will result in a provincewide reduction on residential speeds from 50 kilometres an hour to 40.</p>
      <p>Haynes said such a reduction would reduce fuel consumption, decrease the production of greenhouse gases and improve safety and so reduce medical costs.</p>
      <p>He said as a municipality, the District of Saanich already has the option of reducing speeds on its own streets. But he fears if municipalities start acting on their own initiative, it will create a patchwork of speed limits across the province that will confuse and confound drivers instead of changing habits.</p>
      <p>Councils throughout the province, through the Union of B.C. Municipalities, have been asking for such changes for years but past provincial governments have failed to act, Haynes said.</p>
      <p>The motion was scheduled for debate Monday evening.</p>
