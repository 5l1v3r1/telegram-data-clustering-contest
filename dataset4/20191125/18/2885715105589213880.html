      <h3>ARIES (Mar 21 – Apr. 20)</h3>
      <p>If you still feel confused or frustrated, you probably haven’t realised that there is a great deal to be accomplished. Over the coming seven days a new weapon will be added to your armoury: an ability to charm other people any way you want, any time you want.</p>
      <h3>TAURUS (Apr. 21 – May 21)</h3>
      <p>Adverse planetary activity has certainly knocked you off balance, but it doesn’t usually take you long to regain your equilibrium. It seems all too easy, at the moment, to blame other people, but that might not be the best way of going about things.</p>

      <h3>GEMINI (May 22 – June 21)</h3>
      <p>Money is bound to be an increasingly powerful factor, and why not? After all, nobody gets very far without it. Put the maximum effort into increasing your earnings, but do so in the knowledge that, first of all, only hard work will produce the desired results and, secondly, you should not wish for more than you deserve.</p>
      <h3>CANCER (June 22 – July 23)</h3>
      <p>Most of the conflicts and uncertainty in your solar chart at the moment arise from other people’s lack of commitment, or so it seems. Are you sure you don’t have a personal vested interest in seeing that someone backs off? Perhaps you just need some more time for yourself.</p>
      <h3>LEO (July 24 – Aug. 23)</h3>
      <p>I know I have given you this advice before, but it must be repeated: wait until you are absolutely ready if you have a major change or upheaval to undertake, and don’t allow others to make your decisions for you. You may, of course, continue to set up all the necessary preparations for your next step.</p>
      <h3>VIRGO (Aug. 24 – Sept. 23)</h3>
      <p>The stars are still urging you on, so don’t wait for others to give the green light before pressing ahead. You now have all the ammunition and information you require to make a decisive move, and all you need now is the assurance that you’ll have the support you’ve asked for.</p>
      <h3>LIBRA (Sept. 24 – Oct. 23)</h3>
      <p>There are a number of thought-provoking aspects in your chart at the moment. One of the most obvious indicates that someone who has been unpunctual, indecisive and utterly unreliable, may now be mending their ways. Is that too much to hope for? I don’t think so!</p>
      <h3>SCORPIO (Oct. 24 – Nov. 22)</h3>
      <p>The Sun, the brightest planet and the soul of the solar system, is approaching a decisive relationship with a series of dim and distant parts of the sky. This is the simple reason why an emotional tie or attachment now appears to be going through a confusing phase.</p>
      <h3>SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 – Dec. 22)</h3>
      <p>Personally, and emotionally, you are now coming to the end of one brief phase and are about to enter another which might be much more refreshing. One result is that you’ll become increasingly concerned about the cost of a particular relationship.</p>
      <h3>CAPRICORN (Dec. 23 – Jan. 20)</h3>
      <p>Sometimes you need to come first but why not try to put yourself in someone else’s shoes and understand why they’ve been throwing their weight around. It may be that they have been upset and frightened, in which case they need your sympathy and support.</p>
      <h3>AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 – Feb. 19)</h3>
      <p>The Moon rises in an intriguing position, an indication that it could be time for an early start. It also, by the way, suggests that you may make an early finish, so don’t work late unless there is no alternative. Make time for activities which mean most to you, not for what other people think you should be doing.</p>
      <h3>PISCES (Feb. 20 – Mar 20)</h3>
      <p>It’s time to reflect on the many changes you’ve made so far. It is also time to take a risk and, given that you listen to your intuitions, tough planets like Mars and Pluto should guide you to a successful conclusion and sensitive ones like Venus and Neptune will smooth the way.</p>
