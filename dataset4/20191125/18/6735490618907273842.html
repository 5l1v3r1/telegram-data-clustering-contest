      <p>It looks like fans can turn to Mark McGrath if they need help letting their significant other down easy.</p>
      <p>In a now-viral video posted to Twitter, the Sugar Ray frontman helped a woman (named Cheyenne) break up with her now ex-boyfriend, Bradyn.</p>
      <p>“She wants you to know that you mean a lot to her,” McGrath said in a clip. “You mean the world to her. But she’s having difficulty staying in this long-distance relationship.”</p>
      <p>“She still wants to be friends with you, and she wants you to know, good luck on your thesis coming up — probably not the best timing, Cheyenne, when he’s doing his thesis, but I understand!” he added while referring his own marriage and the difficult part of being on the road touring.</p>
