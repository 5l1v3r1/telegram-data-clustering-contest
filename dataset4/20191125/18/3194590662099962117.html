      <h1>‘Give me my car’ — Mr Eazi shades Headies over 2016 ‘Next Rated’ award gift</h1>

        <b>Oluwatosin Ajibade, Nigerian Afrobeats singer better known as Mr Eazi, has aimed a dig at organisers of the Headies Awards for allegedly not giving him a car he won at the 2016 edition of its annual event.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The award-winning singer took to his Twitter page to express his annoyance while reacting to a post by HipTv, a media partner and major organiser of the Headies.</p>
      <p>The post ordinarily seemed to be an appreciation of Mr Eazi’s outfit and that of Temi Otedola, his girlfriend.</p>
      <p>“@jtofashion x @mreazi Feeling like Tony Montana and Elvira both in that new #JTOxOC collection,” HipTv wrote.</p>
      <p>But rather than reciprocate the gesture, the singer disclosed a shocking revelation in his response.</p>
      <p>His reaction suggests he might not have received the car he won in 2016 where he emerged the ‘Next Rated’ artiste — beating the likes of Humblesmith, Aramide, and Ycee to clinch the coveted award.</p>
      <p>“Instead make u gimme my car u dey here dey tweet couple goals,” the singer replied.</p>

      <p>His response has since left tongues wagging on the social media platform, with many trying to dig deep into what actually informed the singer’s response.</p>
      <p>Established in 2006, the Headies — formerly known as Hip Hop World Awards — celebrates outstanding individuals in the Nigerian music industry over a period of time under review.</p>
      <p>While HipTv is yet to officially respond to the tweet — as of the time this report was filed — there appears to be a video on the Yotube page of the cable television channel where Mr Eazi can be seen “receiving a car”.</p>
