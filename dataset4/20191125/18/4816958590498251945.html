      <h2>The onslaught of bushfires in Australia has pushed the koala to the forefront of people's minds, but it's not as bad as you think</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:05:01+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:05</time> by <a rel="author">National Post Staff</a></address>
      <p>Over the weekend, social media users grew alarmed over reports that koalas are now “functionally extinct” following devastating wildfires. Turns out, the iconic Australian creature is not gone anywhere.</p>
      <p>Unprecedented fires ripped through Queensland and New South Wales this month, killing six people and burning hundreds of thousands of hectares of land. Firefighters were battling a 6,000 kilometre-long front at one point, the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/22/australia-bushfires-factcheck-are-this-years-fires-unprecedented">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The onslaught pushed the koala to the forefront of people’s minds, with <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7713561/Expert-claims-koalas-functionally-extinct-bushfires-destroy-80-cent-habitat.html">many</a><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2019/11/23/koalas-functionally-extinct-after-australia-bushfires-destroy-80-of-their-habitat/#45f1cc3c7bad">headlines</a>, peppered with images of charred and nearly lifeless koalas, indicating that the animal is pretty much on its outs because its habitat has been lost.</p>
      <p>But while it is true that many koalas perished in the flames, not enough of them died for them to be considered wiped out, koala expert and biologist Christine Hosking told <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/the-feed/reports-claim-koalas-are-now-functionally-extinct-that-s-not-actually-true">SBS</a>.</p>
      <p>“Functionally extinct” means the population of a species has declined so much that they don’t have a significant impact on their ecosystem. As well, they cannot reproduce fast enough to grow the population, Hosking <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-report-claims-koalas-are-functionally-extinct-but-what-does-that-mean-116665">wrote</a> in The Conversation in May.</p>

      <p>On Saturday, Forbes published an article saying 80 per cent of the animals’ habitat has been destroyed and 1,000 koalas had died. Officials<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/australia-faces-national-tragedy-over-loss-koala-after-recent-brushfires-180973570/"> in Port Macquarie reported</a> half to two-thirds of the local population were incinerated, and many more could die due to habitat loss, starvation or dehydration.</p>
      <p>However, the Forbes article also quoted a BBC report from May that stated koalas are “functionally extinct.” In doing so, it cited the Australian Koala Foundation, which is a non-profit NGO. The news came from a press release released by the conservationist group at that time, which claimed that only 80,000 koalas were at that point left in the wild.</p>
      <p>“This is approximately 1% of the 8 million Koalas that were shot for fur and sent to London between 1890 and 1927,” the statement <a href="https://www.savethekoala.com/sites/savethekoala.com/files/uploads/AKF_press_release_10_may_2019.pdf">said</a>. “Since 2010, the AKF has monitored the 128 federal electorates that fall within the range of the Koala and it is shocking that 41 electorates have no Koalas; they are extinct.”</p>

      <p>Jacquelyn Gill, an ecologist at the University of Maine, pointed out that non-profits in the past have exaggerated population declines. “These organizations then benefit from increases in donations, which raises questions about conflicts of interest,” she tweeted.</p>

      <p>Hosking said the number of koalas is hard to nail down because they’re spread all over the country and their natural habitats can be inaccessible.</p>
      <p>In 2016, 15 koala experts attempted to determine how many koalas there actually are in Australia, and placed the number at 329,000.</p>
      <p>In some areas, populations are declining while in parts of the country, particularly the south, the animals are over-abundant and considered pests.</p>
      <p>Despite all the confusion, the koalas and their habitats are indeed under threat due to human activity and climate change, Rebecca Johnson, a koala geneticist at the Australian Museum, told <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/koalas-are-not-functionally-extinct-but-they-need-our-help/">CNET</a>.</p>
      <p>“Koalas are the iconic reminder of what is happening more broadly to our biodiversity and our ecosystems, directly as a result of human impacts,” she said. “They should be the catalyst to start and have these conversations to understand and protect all our biodiversity because they aren’t the only species that needs protecting.”</p>
