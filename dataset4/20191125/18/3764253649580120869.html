      <p>Nigerian music star, David ‘Davido’ Adeleke, appears to be having the time of his life and he does not tire to display it on social media for fans to see.</p>
      <p>Just recently, the Omo Baba Olowo as he is fondly called was opportune to meet fellow entertainers in the international <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/nigerian-music-industry.html">music industry</a>, Trey Songz and JCole.</p>
      <p>Davido was at the Madison Square Garden where he watched the Knicks vs Nets basketball game when he met the entertainers and they all posed together for a picture.</p>

      <p>Speaking of good times,<a href="https://www.legit.ng/1278047-davidos-vibe-evolved-fans-react-singer-releases-album.html"> Davido recently released a new album titled A Good Time.</a> The past few months for the popular singer had been riddled with the music star gearing up his fans and supporters for the coming of his second studio album.</p>
      <p>From occasionally dropping teasers on his social media pages, to reiterating the amount of effort and dedication he put into the project, Davido had been speaking and indeed, people were listening.</p>
      <p>The moment of glory finally came at the early hours of Friday, November 22, when the album dropped on multiple music streaming platforms in the world and received an incredible reception from music lovers that have had their appetite aroused time and again.</p>
