      <p>So you decided to participate in Secret Santa this year, but now time's running out and the only ideas you've got are a six pack of beer and a Chipotle gift card. <i>Woof.</i></p>
      <p>I mean, sure, most of us would be happy with free beer, but it would be in the spirit of the season to make it a little more personal—even if you don't quite know the person to which you've been assigned.</p>
      <p>Fear not: We spend all year testing products and separating the good stuff from the bad. Let us help you make this the best Secret Santa to date. (Or, at the very least, let's make it slightly less awkward.)</p>
