      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">The Rams</a> were said to be <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-transfer-target-plotting-3250417">considering a deadline-day move for Sinclair</a> back in August, before they secured a season-long loan deal for Bristol City's Jamie Paterson.</p>

      <p>Sinclair is out of contract at Celtic in the summer.</p>
