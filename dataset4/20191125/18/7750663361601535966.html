      <p>After replacing <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a> in the dugout at the north London outfit, Mourinho may now look to stamp his own mark on the first-team squad.</p>
      <p>While the Portuguese has <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/transfer-talk/news/jose-mourinho-rules-out-spurs-signing-zlatan-ibrahimovic_380594.html">ruled out an approach</a> for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/zlatan-ibrahimovic/"><b>Zlatan Ibrahimovic</b></a>, <i>90 min</i> claims that the 56-year-old is considering bids for compatriots Dias and Fernandes.</p>
      <p>The latter was heavily linked with a switch to the Premier League during the summer, only to remain at <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/sporting-lisbon/"><b>Sporting Lisbon</b></a> for the first half of the season.</p>
      <p>Dias is known to have a release clause in his contract, although <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/benfica/"><b>Benfica</b></a> are attempting to up that fee before the start of the January window.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has allegedly asked super-agent <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jorge-mendes/"><b>Jorge Mendes</b></a> to keep him up-to-date with any developments.</p>
