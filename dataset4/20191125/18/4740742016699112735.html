      <h1>Rap star Solo 45 'abused woman because she said hello to musician'</h1>
      <h2>Warning: Evidence can include graphic details that some readers may find upsetting</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:21:28+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:21</time> by <a rel="author">Tristan Cork</a></address>
      <p>Rap star Andy Anokye abused a woman after accusing her of flirting with a musician, a court has heard.</p>
      <p>Anokye, better known as London grime artist Solo 45 is <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/solo-45-rape-bristol-trial-3569626">accused of stabbing, ‘waterboarding’ and beating up a woman</a> in what he described as a gang-style ‘Three Day Ordeal’.</p>
      <p>The woman is one of four who separately allege Anokye raped, imprisoned and assaulted them over a period of 26 months from 2015 to 2017.</p>
      <p>The alleged crimes happened in the UK and abroad, and the final offences of the 31 Anokye is charged with, happened in Bristol in 2017, after the rapper moved here.</p>
      <p>Anokye, who denies all 31 charges, sat passively in the dock on the third day of the trial, as the first woman to give evidence, did so from behind a screen.</p>

        <b>We are <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/solo-45-trial-court-live-3560956">reporting updates on this trial here</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With a tearful, faltering voice, the woman said how she first met him at a concert, and later visited him at his flat, before seeing him more often.</p>
      <p>This morning (November 25), the jury at <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/courts">Bristol Crown Court</a> watched six video clips Anokye filmed on his mobile phone, that the prosecution allege show him raping the woman on several occasions.</p>
      <p>This afternoon, the woman gave evidence and said she had not given consent to the acts shown in the clips.</p>
      <p>Questioned by prosecution counsel Christopher Quinlan, the woman said Anokye attacked her after she had said hello to a musician.</p>
      <h3>'I was frightened'</h3>
      <p>“Andy was quite argumentative. He was on edge, angry about something,” she said.</p>
      <p>“It resulted in him strangling me. I don’t think he told me why it had occurred. It was after it turned out he saw me looking over to [the musician], and he told me I wanted him to fancy me.</p>
      <p>“I remember that he had his hand around my throat.</p>
      <p>“I was frightened, I just tried to push him off and was crying.”</p>
      <p>The court heard the abuse continued and Anokye told the woman of a gang-style punishment called ‘The Three Day Ordeal’, which she was then subjected to.</p>
      <p>“He told me that he was in a gang and they did this thing called a Three Day Ordeal, if someone disrespected someone in that gang,” she said.</p>
      <p>“On the third day he was punching and kicking me, but not hurting me as much as the other two days. It was like he was just trying to prove a point.”</p>
      <p>“He told me to drink vodka. At this point, I was doing anything he told me to do,” she said.</p>
      <p>“When you say he made you do something, how did he do that?” asked Mr Quinlan.</p>

      <p>“He would stand over me, being quite intimidating, pouring me a glass, saying ‘drink it, drink it’,” said the woman.</p>
      <p>“He would constantly question me about things, make me admit things I’d done. It would always be that I was lying to him about something,” she added.</p>
      <p>The court heard the woman’s ordeal continued, with Anokye’s jealous rages turning ever more sinister.</p>
      <p>“He was asking why I was outside flirting with [the musician]. He told me that it was because I wanted him to fancy me. That’s why he was angry, that’s what he was asking me to admit.</p>
      <p>“He tied me up over the bath, put a flannel over my face, and then the shower over my face, while questioning me.</p>
      <h3>'He poured bleach in my mouth'</h3>
      <p>“I don’t know if it was that time or another time that he poured bleach into my mouth.</p>
      <p>“He had a knife and was dropping it onto my head. I was sat in the bath and he was standing over me and he was dropping it blade downwards onto the top of my head and it was bleeding.</p>
      <p>“I was just crying, I think I was still trying to think of things to tell him that would be why he was angry,” she said</p>
      <p>The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the jury he took her to a shop and bought a knife with a hook on the end of the blade.</p>
      <p>“He stabbed me to my thigh, that day,” she said, adding that she went to hospital for treatment.</p>
      <p>On another occasion, she said: “He held the knife to my throat. It was like a flick knife, it had like a hook on the end of it.</p>
      <p>“He had it to my throat, the sharp part, and was pushing it hard. I thought that it had cut,” she said.</p>
      <p>Mr Quinlan, prosecuting, asked her what she did in response.</p>
      <p>“I think I was probably pleading, (for him) not to kill me.</p>

      <p>“I can’t remember that incident, when it was, it all sort of rolled into one, all the occasions of assault, while I was there.”</p>
      <p>The woman told the jury that as the abuse continued over the next few days and weeks, she ‘gave up’.</p>
      <p>“To begin with it was once or twice a week, and then it was every day.... Hitting, threatening me with a knife on many occasions, strangling,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We had sex after he abused me. I didn’t instigate it. I didn’t want it, but I knew that it meant I would be safe for that day,” the woman told the jury, under questioning from Mr Quinlan, prosecuting.</p>
      <p>“To me it was a relief because it meant it (the abuse) was over for that day. I didn’t say ‘no’ because I was scared of him hurting me again,” she added.</p>
      <p>“I had bruising under my left and right arms, and right down my chest under my breasts,” the woman said, describing how Anokye left her following that ordeal. “It was like I had a black t-shirt on.</p>
      <p>“He was assaulting me every day,” she said. “My face had completely changed shape - it was completely square.</p>
      <p>“I had swelling for about six months after. My eyes were red, swollen, my eyeballs were red. Around my eyes was black. I went out once in this time, and wore sunglasses and didn’t look at anyone,” she added.</p>
      <p>The jury heard the woman ‘just gave up’.</p>
      <p>“He was kneeing me, hitting me, hit me on the head with the corner of an iPhone, causing cuts.</p>
      <p>“There was just lumps coming off my head.</p>
      <h3>'He then started to threaten my family'</h3>
      <p>“At this point I think I’d become submissive. Instead of pulling away or asking him not to, I’d lean my head towards him.</p>
      <p>“I’d just given up trying to do anything,” she added.</p>
      <p>But the woman said when she began to stop resisting or complaining about the abuse, Anokye changed to be more sinister about her family.</p>
      <p>“When he wasn’t getting any more fun out of hitting me, because I wasn’t fighting it anymore, he then started to threaten my family, that he was going to kill my mum and my brother,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Did you believe him?” asked Mr Quinlan.</p>
      <p>“Yes, I believed everything he said. He’d always mention my mum and my brother and how he knew where they lived. He would say that he was going to have them killed,” she added.</p>
      <p>Anokye denies 22 counts of rape and five counts of false imprisonment. He also denies two charges of assault by penetration and two charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The case continues.</p>
