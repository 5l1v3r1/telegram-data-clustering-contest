      <h3>Mileage on the new rubber</h3>
      <p>Abu Dhabi is a springboard into next season, as it hosts the final test of the calendar year. The results from the final race weekend are important too in terms of data as it's the final time teams can measure themselves against the rest of the grid. After that, everything is behind closed doors until the unveils ahead of the 2020 winter tests.</p>

      <p>2020 will have more or less the same regulations, meaning testing with new parts will be more valuable than usual.</p>
      <h3>Championship implications</h3>
      <p>The top four places in the constructors' championship are already set - <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> secured fourth place last weekend in Brazil after Carlos Sainz' incredible podium finish.</p>
      <p>Behind the Woking-based team, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/renault-f1-team">Renault</a> will now have to check their rear-view mirrors as they're just eight points ahead of <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/toro-rosso">Toro Rosso</a> now. The development team have been in red-hot form recently and should be competitive again in Abu Dhabi. With the difference between fifth and sixth place being several millions in prize money, both sides should be throwing everything they have at this weekend's race.</p>
