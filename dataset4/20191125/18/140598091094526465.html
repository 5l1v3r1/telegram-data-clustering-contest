      <h1>Indian coffee chain in hot water over facial recognition technology</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:34:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/j/joe-wallen/" target="_blank">Joe Wallen</a></address>
      <p>One of India’s largest cafe chains has sparked a privacy furore after installing facial recognition technology that signs customers up for a loyalty account without their knowledge.</p>
      <p>Chaayos – which aims to open over 300 outlets nationwide by 2023 – is trialling a new system in its New Delhi stores where a camera takes a photograph of a customer as they make a purchase and registers them for the bonus service. </p>
      <p>The technology can then recognise a returning customer from their picture and automatically generates them loyalty points based on what they buy.</p>
      <p>India does not currently have laws which forbid companies from collecting or distributing biometric data and the country has a turbulent relationship with the technology.</p>
      <p>The government launched the Aadhaar policy in 2009 which saw the recording of fingerprints, photographs and iris scans of more than 1.2 billion people so they could more efficiently receive welfare payments.</p>
      <p>However, the system was repeatedly hit by leaks of private data.</p>
      <p>In one instance the names, job titles and phone numbers of 166,000 people in the state of Jharkhand were made available to the public in a security breach.</p>
      <p>In accordance with Indian law, Chaayos says it can “disclose information to government authorities or competent authorities or credit bureaus or third persons” within its terms and conditions.</p>
      <p>Despite the company releasing a statement assuring it would not share biometric data to any third-party its customers were not convinced.</p>
      <p>“How is collecting facial data helping you serve better tea? Liars,” wrote one on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“Why are you collecting photo without permission? Why is it required to sell tea or any products?” said another.</p>
      <p>Chaayos says its customers can opt out of the facial recognition loyalty programme at any time but consumers took to social media to say they were not informed of the policy.</p>
      <p>They also claim the photographs were taken without their permission.</p>
