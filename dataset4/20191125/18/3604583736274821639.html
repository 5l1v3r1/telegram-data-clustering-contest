      <h1>Nightingale housing project goes to planning committee</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jolyon Attwooll</a></address>
      <p>One of Ballarat's most talked about building projects goes before council's planning committee this week, with 11 objections to the project.</p>
      <p>The Nightingale apartments - proposed by a group known for an emphasis on environmental sustainability - are proposed for 11 Davey Street in Ballarat Central.</p>
      <p>If the plans go ahead, it would involve the demolition of an old warehouse, and the construction of a four-storey apartment block with 27 separate residences, including 17 two-bedroom dwellings, six one-bedroom flats and four three-bedroom dwellings. There would also be 14 car parking spaces proposed (a reduction of 24 on standard planning scheme requirements), as well as 54 bicycle spaces.</p>
      <p>The proposals would follow the same, non-profit model as developments in Melbourne, with two built in recent years in Brunswick in the inner north. Apartments are sold at cost, and measures worked in to help the building be environmentally sustainable. Designed by Breathe Architecture, the Nightingale building projects do not employ real estate agents or build display suites.</p>
      <p>If the apartments are built, 20 per cent would be set aside as affordable housing, and another 20 per cent reserved for 'key community contributors' such as nurses, teachers or those in creative industries.</p>
      <p>Under the proposals, there would be basement parking for a reduced level of cars (14 in total), a solar energy facility on the roof, and a licensed food and drink premises limited to around 45 patrons.</p>
      <p>As the first of its kind in regional Victoria, the buzz around the project has been unusual - with one council director describing it as <a href="https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/6365179/nightingale-ballarat-apartments-snapped-up-off-plan/">"manna from heaven"</a>.</p>
      <p>However, it has not been universally welcomed. With 11 objections to the application, council officers have recommended its approval subject to amended plans being approved.</p>

      <p>The objections mostly identified concerns with neighbourhood character - including density and building height - as well worries over traffic and parking, and the proposed licensed food and drinks premises.</p>
      <p>Conditions include the retention of existing hedges and increasing the height of fencing to 1.8 metres on two sides of the building. There would also be additional planting at the rear boundary with properties on Lyons Street North.</p>

      <p>A proposed artwork that would have gone along the north-facing wall will now need to go through a separate planning process.</p>
      <p>The original planning application was lodged with council in June and went on advertising in September.</p>

      <p>Other plans with fewer objections have been approved without going in front of the planning committee.</p>
      <p>For example, proposals for a 20-dwelling development in Lydiard Street North with 23 objections was given the green light without going to the planning special committee.</p>
      <p>However, the Nightingale project was deemed as a "significant proposal of public interest", and has been referred.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In September, the group behind the project said that around 70 per cent of the apartments for the project had been reserved after a ballot process.</p>
      <p>This meant 19 out of 27 proposed apartments were allotted before the planning application for the project was put on public advertising. Another two have also since been reserved.</p>
      <p>Planners in Ballarat are looking to increase the amount of people living in the CBD, with a target of meeting up to half the demand for housing in Ballarat with developments in the city centre as its population increases.</p>
      <p>However, demand for in-fill developments is currently lagging below the target. Recently, council approved plans to earmark two further potential growth zones to the north and west of the city.</p>

      <p>Joe van Dyk, whose company Hygge Property suggested the Davey Street site as a suitable location for the Nightingale, said that if plans were approved, work might begin in May next year.</p>
      <p>Even if approved, the project would be unlikely to finish before September 2021.</p>
      <p>The committee meets in the Trench Room in the town hall at 7pm this Wednesday (November 27), with the meeting open to the public.</p>
      <p>Also on the agenda at the same meeting will be the proposal to put a heritage overlay over the old <a href="https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/6498385/heritage-overlay-proposed-for-former-saleyards/">Latrobe Street saleyards</a>.</p>
