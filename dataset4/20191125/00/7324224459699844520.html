      <p>Sam Claflin enlisted the help of a clinical psychologist to get into the mindset of a murderous lieutenant for The Nightingale.</p>
      <p>The Peaky Blinders star, 33, plays British Army soldier Lieutenant Hawkins in the period thriller, set in 1825 in a penal colony in Tasmania.</p>
      <p>The feature, from The Babadook director Jennifer Kent, follows a young convict, played by Aisling Franciosi, seeking revenge for a terrible act of violence committed against her family.</p>

      <p>Claflin and Franciosi filmed numerous scenes of violence together including some depicting rape.</p>
      <p>He said: “It took a little while to get into the mindset of a man like that.</p>
      <p>“There had to be, unfortunately, a level of understanding as to why a man would make certain choices so I sat down with Jen and a clinical psychologist to discuss why a man would be in that position.</p>
      <p>“We drafted, or created, a history, I suppose.</p>
      <p>“His history of growing up in a very male-driven family where his mum was probably beaten – he was probably beaten.</p>

      <p>“We said he likely had an older brother and he was never quite as good as his old brother, so it was the inferior complex you know.</p>
      <p>“And for all those reasons suddenly he’s been gifted an opportunity and he sees gold.</p>
      <p>“What was difficult in the actual storytelling of this is I wish there was more vulnerability that you could glimpse.”</p>
      <p>Claflin said working with a psychologist gave him a “level of understanding” that informed his work on a “daily basis”.</p>

      <p>He added: “But also physically getting into a mindset or a place.</p>
      <p>“I think I was very blessed with a very generous cast and crew who would assist me getting to a certain place – whether it’s out of breath or…</p>
      <p>“We were constantly being very physical with one another so I felt very well supported.”</p>
      <p>Franciosi said it had been important the pair “could really, really trust each other” and could be “extremely vulnerable and fragile” on set.</p>
      <p>She added: “We always checked in with each other to make sure that we were both OK, a lot of hugs on set, and I certainly felt very safe with them.”</p>
      <p>The Nightingale is released in UK cinemas on Friday November 29.</p>
