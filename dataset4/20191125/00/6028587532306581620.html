      <p>It’s not hard to fall for Charleston, South Carolina. From its Instagram-worthy architecture to its exciting culinary scene to its warm residents who embody Southern hospitality, there’s no question why <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/worlds-best/cities-in-us">Travel + Leisure named it the top city in the United States</a>.“Charleston feels like a smaller-scale city with big city amenities,” explained Courtney Rowson. She and her business partner, Amy Pastre, are the Founders and Creative Directors of <a href="https://sdcopartners.com/">SDCO Partners</a>. They started their design agency in the Holy City a decade ago, and since then they have had a hand in designing everything from some of the city’s award-winning restaurants to major performing arts festivals. </p>

      <p>Amy admitted, “It’s been exciting to watch the creative renaissance that’s happened in Charleston.” Back in 2009 when they founded SDCO Partners, they were one of the first design studios in town; now, <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2018/08/16/architects-designers-flocking-to-charleston-south-carolina-creative-opportunities-slower-pace/">the design scene in Charleston is booming</a>. Inspiring museums, hip restaurants, boutiques with one-of-a-kind goods and more—the city has a sort of unexpected energy that calls creative people.</p>
      <p>So as a traveler, how can you go past the typical tourist attractions here and instead dive into this exciting design scene? We spoke with Courtney and Amy about where to go and what to do for the ultimate design insider’s experience in Charleston, South Carolina.</p>

        <b>First things first, let’s talk neighborhoods. What’s a solid choice for design lovers to check out?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Amy Pastre:</b> For art and architecture, the historic “South of Broad” area downtown is the best neighborhood. You can start by exploring the <a href="http://www.gibbesmuseum.org/">Gibbes Museum</a>, then stroll over to Broad Street to peek in all the locally-owned art galleries like <a href="https://annlongfineart.com/">Ann Long Fine Art</a> and <a href="http://georgegalleryart.com/">George Gallery</a>. From there, follow the charming homes along Longitude Lane and Jacob’s Alley, and you’ll ultimately wind up at the historic waterfront Battery. Enjoy a respite in White Point Gardens overlooking the water.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Where should people head for more specific activities, like shopping, street art or museum-hopping?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Amy Pastre: There is always great shopping on King Street, but for more locally-owned, one-of-a-kind shops, check out the Cannonborough/Elliotborough neighborhood downtown. <a href="https://starkmade.com/">J. Stark</a> specializes in handmade leather goods, <a href="https://indigoandcotton.com/">Indigo &amp; Cotton</a> is the premier destination for stylish menswear, and <a href="https://www.macandmurphy.com/shop">Mac &amp; Murphy</a> is one of the most beautifully-curated shops in town.  </p>
      <p>There are some spectacular murals throughout Charleston, many of which we’re lucky enough to walk by every day. One of my favorites is at <a href="https://www.xiaobaobiscuit.com/">Xiao Bao Biscuit</a>, which is a favorite lunch and dinner spot in the Cannonborough/Elliotborough neighborhood. The mural is by artist David Boatwright and portrays Sun Wukong, the powerful Monkey King from the Chinese novel “The Journey to the West.” Another incredible mural downtown is adjacent to <a href="https://www.shopthedaily.com/">The Daily</a> (try the salmon toast!), and this one is by Shepard Fairey—a Charleston native who also created the iconic Obama “Hope” mural.</p>

        <figcaption>Visitors will want to check out the Gibbes Museum in Charleston.<cite>MCG Photography</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Courtney Rowson: </b>And for museums, go to the <a href="http://halsey.cofc.edu/">Halsey Institute of Contemporary Art</a>. This museum features contemporary art and visiting artists from around the world. The Halsey always provides a wonderful juxtaposition of contemporary art in a historic city.  </p>
      <p>Others that you have to explore during a visit: <a href="https://charlestonlibrarysociety.org/">Charleston Library Society</a> and <a href="http://www.gibbesmuseum.org/">Gibbes Museum</a>.</p>

      <p><b>Amy Pastre:</b> You can’t visit Charleston without trying <a href="https://lewisbarbecue.com/">Lewis Barbecue</a>. Renowned pitmaster John Lewis set out to introduce Texas barbecue to Charleston through his mouth-watering brisket and dedication to his craft. Everything on the menu is out of this world, and we’re excited about his newest Mexican concept, Juan Luis, set to open this fall.</p>

      <p>Tucked away off King Street, <a href="https://offtrackicecream.com/">Off Track Ice Cream</a> is a brand new spot that makes traditional and vegan ice cream from scratch using fresh, locally-sourced ingredients. <a href="http://www.gnomecafe.com/">Gnome Café</a> is a vegan restaurant with lots of personality and amazing coffee. This place is such a hidden gem. And <a href="http://www.babasoncannon.com/">Babas on Cannon</a> is an old-world style café bar, serving coffee and fine apéro morning through night. It has quickly become one of our go-to’s.</p>

        <b>Which hotel makes for the perfect design-centric stay in Charleston?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Courtney Rowson: </b>We might be a bit biased, but <a href="https://thespectatorhotel.com/">The Spectator</a> is one of our favorite spots in town—we named it and created the brand identity for it! The moment you walk into The Spectator, you’re immediately transported back to the glamorous “Jazz Age” of Charleston. The interiors are beautifully designed by <a href="https://www.jennykeenandesign.com/">Jenny Keenan Interiors</a>, and the lobby is a perfect place to enjoy a classic cocktail before heading out to explore Charleston’s historic district. </p>

      <p>
        <b>What’s your go-to spot in the city for inspiration?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Amy and Courtney:</b> The waterways of Charleston offer a glimpse into another facet of our city. Miles of coastline and tidal creeks surround the city and are the perfect way to get away and connect with the flora and fauna of the lowcountry.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Can you share any final travel tips should visitors know before coming to Charleston?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Courtney Rowson: </b>First of all, bring walking shoes. It’s a great city to walk through and explore on your own. Also, downtown is great to explore by bike, and there are quite a few bike rental places around town, including <a href="https://charlestonbikeshare.com/">Holy Spokes</a> and <a href="https://affordabike.com/">Affordabike</a>. Another great thing to do is hail down a pedi-cab on King Street for a relaxed, al fresco tour of the city. </p>
      <p>Last, the beaches and many of the signature historic sites like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Drayton+Hall&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Drayton Hall</a> are located outside the downtown area, so we recommend driving to get to those. Our public transportation hasn’t quite caught up with the other city amenities, but we do have Uber!</p>
