      <h3>Onoja Eulogizes Bello</h3>
      <p>The Deputy Governor of Kogi State, <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/edward-onoja/"><u>Edward Onoja</u></a></b>, has heaped praises on the Executive Governor of Kogi State, <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/yahaya-bello/"><u>Yahaya Bello</u></a></b>.</p>
      <p>In a tweet on Sunday, Onoja described Yahaya Bello as a “governor with swag”.</p>
      <p>The ‘swag’ description was only one of the many things Onoja said to eulogize the Governor. He also described him as a “boss, leader and friend”.</p>
      <p>And he also added in his tweet: <i>“My boss, my leader my friend. Governor with swag! Who want tamper there?”</i></p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports until last month, Onoja was the chief of staff to Bello but he emerged the deputy governor of the state following the controversial removal of <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/simon-achuba/"><u>Simon Achuba</u></a></b> by the Kogi State house of assembly.</p>
