      <p>Small Caps (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/smallcap-2000">Russell 2000</a>) have lagged large caps for nearly 18 months. Is it time for them to start outperforming large caps?</p>
      <p>
        <b>What they do at (1) will send an important signal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <b>Russell ETF (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/etfs/ishares-russell-2000-index-etf">IWM</a>)</b> has traded sideways for the past 6 months, inside of the blue shaded channel. It is testing the top of this channel for the 5th time.</p>
      <p>This week, IWM is trying to breakout above highs of the past 6 months at (1).</p>
      <p>While it is trying to breakout, a moving average crossover is taking place at the same time, as the RS rating from Marketsmith.com is low and could be turning higher.</p>
      <p>If small caps break out at (1), look for it to attract buyers in the short-term.</p>
