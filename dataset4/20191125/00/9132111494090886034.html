      <p>President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has called for further consultations to be made regarding the impending referendum which will be held on December 17, 2019.</p>
      <p>Deputy Information Minister Pius Enam Hadzide who made this known on Peace FM morning show 'Kokrokoo' said the group will be led by Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia.</p>
      <p>"Before the President travelled, he called for another round of consultation which will be led by Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia. The consultation which is to clear the misunderstanding and misconceptions surrounding the referendum has already started and it will involve chiefs, religious leaders, civil societies and many others" he indicated.</p>

        <b>Background</b>
      </p>
      <p>The December 17 referendum seeks to amend the law to enable Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs) and unit committee members to be elected along political party lines.</p>
      <p>However, there seems to be confusion surrounding the referendum and what it actually entails.</p>
      <p>An earlier research conducted by the Coalition of Domestic Election Observers (CODEO), indicated that six (6) out of every (10) Ghanaian are unaware of the December 17 elections, let alone what it entails.</p>
      <p>Some pundits analysing responses from Ghanaians and a u-turn by the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) have called for a suspension of the referendum for consensus to be reached by everyone and for proper education to be made.</p>
      <p>The Regional Reorganisation and Development Minister, Dan Botwe has proposed a total withdrawal of the December 17 referendum while Dr. Amoako Baah, a political scientist is calling for a suspension.</p>
