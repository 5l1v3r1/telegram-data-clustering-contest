      <h1>Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch</h1>

      <p>Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. U.S. Consumer and Housing Data Due</b>
      </p>
      <p>Top-tier economic data is on the calendar for tomorrow in the form of new home sales and consumer confidence.</p>
      <p>The Conference Board will issue its measure of <a href="https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/cb-consumer-confidence-48">consumer confidence for November at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT)</a>.</p>
      <p>The index is expected to rise to 126.9 in November from 125.9 last month, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.</p>
      <p>Consumer confidence has come under added scrutiny in recent months amid growing concerns over business conditions and employment growth. But sentiment on the consumer remains bullish as few expect spending to slow ahead of the festive holiday season.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the latest data on new home sales are also slated for 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT) from the Commerce Department.</p>
      <p>On average, economists predict that <a href="https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/new-home-sales-222">new home sales</a> rebounded in October, rising 1.1% to a seasonally-adjusted rate of 709,000 units, following a 0.7% decline in sales in September.</p>
      <p>2. <b>Oil Supplies in Focus</b></p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/api-weekly-crude-oil-stock-656">American Petroleum Institute's petroleum data</a> will be closely watched Tuesday after signs that <a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/crude-oil">U.S. crude</a> inventories are finally started to tighten following last week's smaller-than-expected build.</p>
      <p>The API last week reported domestic <a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/crude-oil">crude oil</a> inventories for the week ended Nov. 15, rose by 5.9 million barrels. But that was well above the 1.4 billion barrel build reported a day later by the Energy Information Administration.</p>
      <p>Oil prices have been ticking higher in recent sessions ahead of OPEC's meeting next week, when the oil cartel may announce measures to prop up prices.</p>
      <p>"Two out of our three alternative scenarios present upside risks to oil prices: an extension of the output deal with deeper cuts; or an extension with cuts to NGL [natural gas liquids] supply," JPMorgan said in a note.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/crude-oil">Crude oil prices</a> settled 24 cents higher at $58.01 a barrel.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Retail, Tech Earnings on Deck</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/dollar-tree-inc">DLTR</a>) reports third-quarter earnings before the opening bell on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The discount retailer is <a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/dollar-tree-inc-earnings">expected to report</a> earnings of $1.13 a share on revenue of $5.74 billion, according to consensus estimates from Investing.com. The estimate is 4.2% lower than the $1.18 the company earned a year ago. Revenue would be up 3.6% from the year-ago quarter's $5.54 billion.</p>
      <p>Shares are up 24.4% this year.</p>
      <p>As well as earnings, same-store sales will be in focus to gauge whether the retailer has continued to mitigate the impact of increased tariffs on Chinese imported goods by diversifying its supply chain and cost control.</p>
      <p>Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/dollar-tree-inc">DLTR</a>) previously said it expected third-quarter sales of $5.66 billion to $5.77 billion. Analysts are looking for $5.74 billion.</p>
      <p>Best Buy (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/best-buy">BBY</a>), meanwhile, is expected to <a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/best-buy-earnings">report earnings </a>of $1.03 a share on revenue of $9.71 billion, with many keen to see whether its sales of appliances, tablets, and headphones can continue to offset declines in video gaming and home theater sectors. In the year ago quarter, Best Buy earned 93 cents a share on revenue of $9.59 billion. Shares are up 40% this year.</p>
      <p>The electronics-goods retailer has guided third-quarter comps to grow in the range of 0.5% and 1.5%.</p>
      <p>Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/dicks-sporting-goods-inc">DKS</a>) will also be among the retailers reporting results and is expected to <a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/dicks-sporting-goods-inc-earnings">report earnings</a> of 38 cents a share on revenue of $1.91 billion, compared with earnings of 39 cents and revenue of $1.86 billion in the year-ago quarter.</p>
      <p>In tech, <a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/dell-inc-earnings">Dell</a>, <a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/vm-ware-inc-earnings">VMware</a> and <a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/hewlett-pack-earnings">HP</a> are set to report quarterly results after the closing bell.</p>
