      <p>NXT Women’s Champion Shayna Baszler left WWE Survivor Series 2019 with arguably the biggest victory of her, outlasting Raw Women’s Champion Becky Lynch and SmackDown Women’s Champion Bayley in one of the most anticipated women’s matches in recent memory.Baszler, who has received one of the strongest pushes in the history of WWE’s women’s division, was able to tap out Bayley, not just earning bragging rights for the yellow brand but also setting the stage for the continuation of her red hot feud with “The Man” and perhaps an even bigger match down the road.</p>
      <p>A former UFC star and a two-time NXT Women’s Champion whose current reign has lasted more than a year, Baszler is expected to <a href="https://wrestletalk.com/news/wwe-potentially-preparing-for-shayna-baszler-main-roster-call-up/">make the move from NXT to Raw or SmackDown</a> at some point in 2020, and though NXT’s move to USA Network (and its <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/wwe-nxt-viewership-down-for-this-week-662194/">disappointing viewership</a> there) may have changed those plans, she has accomplished just about everything she can in NXT. In fact, one could argue that NXT’s women’s division has gotten to the point where Baszler’s massive push and seemingly never-ending title reign has been more detrimental than helpful to the rest of NXT’s female superstars because the division has revolved around her for so long.</p>
      <p>Truth be told, Baszler is long overdue for a call-up–which some now consider a lateral move–to Raw or SmackDown, and her ongoing storyline with Lynch paves the way for WWE to finally move her to the red or blue brand, especially after Lynch attacked Baszler following her big win at Survivor Series. Of course, there is an easy story to tell here, with the wildly popular Lynch–the same star who became so well-liked that she passed John Cena and Roman Reigns to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakeoestriecher/2019/03/28/wwe-has-a-new-no-1-merchandise-seller-and-it-might-surprise-you-who-it-is/#126ed5bd2981">become WWE’s No. 1 merchandise seller–</a>crossing paths with her fellow Four Horsewoman Bayley and Baszler, who just so happens to be part of MMA’s Four Horsewoman group headed by Ronda Rousey, Lynch’s biggest rival and a star who was able to make history alongside Lynch and Charlotte Flair when they became the first women to ever main event WrestleMania at WrestleMania 35 earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Although Rousey’s return to WWE–once <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2845594-wwe-rumors-ronda-rouseys-return-imminent-hasnt-appeared-since-wrestlemania">described as “imminent”–</a>isn’t a sure thing even though her contract <a href="https://comicbook.com/wwe/2019/01/24/ronda-rousey-wwe-contract-expires-April-2021/">doesn’t expire until 2021</a>, Rousey has reportedly been <a href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2019/4/8/18301088/ronda-rousey-vs-becky-lynch-wrestlemania-36-wwe-plan-si-report">penciled in for a WrestleMania 36</a> match against Lynch, which would also mark the first-ever singles match between the two. That match could very well result in Rousey and Lynch main eventing WrestleMania for a second straight year, but even if that bout doesn’t happen, WWE could be building toward another blockbuster match involving not just Lynch and Baszler but Bayley and the remainder of the two sets of Four Horsewomen.</p>
      <p>In fact, it was right around this time last year that WWE was <a href="https://411mania.com/wrestling/wwe-reportedly-planning-horsewomen-vs-horsewomen-match-survivor-series/">reportedly considering doing a Four Horsewomen vs. Four Horsewomen dream match</a> at Survivor Series 2019, a bout that would have pitted Rousey, Baszler, Marina Shafir and Jessamyn Duke against Lynch, Flair, Bayley and Sasha Banks and would have been a fantastic way to shine a much deserved spotlight on the star-studded women’s division. While that match obviously never happened, WWE has kept open a slew of possibilities that would see MMA’s Four Horsewomen battle it out with WWE’s version of the quartet, whether in a series of blockbuster singles and tag team matches or a 4-on-4 elimination match that would be the talk of the town.</p>
      <p>Especially with Natalya recently indicating that <a href="https://wrestlingnews.co/wwe-news/natalya-believes-wwe-evolution-2-is-right-around-the-corner/">a second all-women’s Evolution pay-per-view could be right around the corner</a>, there’s reason to believe that all of the recent developments involving Baszler and Lynch–as well as the circumstances surrounding the other women that would be involved in this match–have all happened by design, with the intent of making a big splash in the women’s division on the road to Royal Rumble and WrestleMania season. After all, the women’s divisions on both Raw and SmackDown have both hit a wall as of late as anyone outside of WWE’s Four Horsewomen and Alexa Bliss has been put on the backburner while WWE has largely failed at creating new female stars.</p>
      <p>If WWE remains insistent on focusing almost exclusively on the Four Horsewomen–and virtually everything suggests it will–then Survivor Series certainly laid the groundwork for that to continue.</p>
      <p>So, Lynch may have lost at Survivor Series, but it could be the fans who win in the long run.</p>
