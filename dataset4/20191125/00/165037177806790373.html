      <h1>Klopp warns Liverpool over late escapes after Palace triumph</h1>

        <b>Late goals have lifted Liverpool to a commanding position in the Premier League but Jurgen Klopp knows change is needed.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Jurgen Klopp urged Liverpool to stop relying on late goals</b> following the physically taxing <b>2-1 victory over Crystal Palace </b>on Saturday.</p>
      <p><b>Roberto Firmino</b> prodded home an 85th-minute winner at Selhurst Park to preserve the Premier League leaders' eight-point advantage over second-placed Leicester City.</p>
      <p><b>Sadio Mane put Liverpool ahead</b> early in the second half, before Wilfried Zaha equalised eight minutes from full-time.</p>
      <p>Firmino's intervention means the European champions have now snatched vital points with goals in the 85th minute or later from four of their past six league fixtures.</p>
      <p><b>"You can't take it for granted,"</b> Reds boss Klopp told reporters.</p>
      <p>"I don't like to talk about it. I understand why you are asking. It's not like 'very good,<b> seven minutes to go</b>, let's start winning now'. That's not what we are like.</p>
      <p>"We don't think about it, we just know. We have had four years together.<b> I know a lot about my team</b>. </p>

      <p>"I know what we want, I know what we have to do for it. But we're not the only team who knows that.<b> It was difficult fitness-wise at Palace </b>because there were so many different things.</p>
      <p>"We know a lot, but we don't know exactly what the boys have been doing with their national teams. <b>They are nine or 10 days</b> away with their national teams. That's a lot of sessions."</p>
      <p>Liverpool forged their fruitful habit last season, notably squeezing past <b>Tottenham</b> and <b>Newcastle United </b>in the final weeks of an absorbing title battle with Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Andy Robertson, scorer in a thrilling turnaround<b> against Aston Villa earlier this month</b>, admitted decisive goals must start to come earlier.</p>
      <p>"Scoring late is good and enjoyable but we would much rather be 2-0 or 3-0 up and see out the game," the left-back said.</p>
      <p>"<b>We cannot keep relying on it </b>but it is good we have that mentality and we did not panic because we have been in this position so many times.</p>
      <p>"I think that is why <b>we took control of the game</b> and scored the winner."</p>
