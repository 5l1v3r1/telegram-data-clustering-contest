      <p>When Tracy Walker finishes her tenure as principal at Waitaki Girls’ High School in Oamaru this year, one of the things she will miss the most is the "Waitaki way".</p>
      <p>She started at the school in July 2012, after a stint as deputy principal at Wairarapa College, in Masterton.</p>
      <p>After 33 years in the education sector, she still enjoyed her involvement in it and looked forward to taking the reins at Palmerston North Girls’ College in term one next year.</p>
      <p>Mrs Walker, who comes from a family of teachers, said she would take plenty of fond memories with her when she left Waitaki Girls’.</p>
      <p>Highlights included the school’s "very strong" endorsement from the Education Review Office this year, seeing the academic, cultural and sporting success of pupils, and the relationship she had formed with pupils, staff and the school’s board.</p>
      <p>In terms of what she would miss the most, Mrs Walker said that was difficult to put into words.</p>
      <p>"It’s really hard to sum it up.</p>
      <p>"I’m really going to miss the Waitaki way. I think we’re a niche school and we reflect our community.</p>
      <p>‘Oamaru is a quirky wee town in the South Island . . . I know I’ll miss it."</p>
      <p>She had set herself a few goals for next year, largely based on enhancing the reputation of the already high-achieving school.</p>
      <p>"It would be to get to know the school community really. I think the long-term goals would be to continue that journey of excellence and just ensuring all girls can shine."</p>
