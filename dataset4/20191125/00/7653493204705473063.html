      <h1>Canon Bumps Standard Manufacturers’ Warranty To 5 Years</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/jan-arreza/" target="_blank">Jan Arreza</a></address>
      <p>Canon has announced it is offering a new five-year standard manufacturers’ warranty for products in its mirrorless, DSLR, digital video camera and lens product ranges from today.</p>
      <p>The catalyst for the expansion of the company’s standard manufacturers’ warranty was a recent independent survey that Canon undertook in relation to warranty expectations of Australian consumers.</p>
      <p>Canon Australia independently commissioned the <i>Consumer Warranty Expectations Survey 2019</i> and found that the country’s adult consumers link the length of a manufacturer warranty to brand trust, good value and product quality.</p>
      <p>The survey was conducted on the YouGov Galaxy Research online national omnibus between November 7-12, 2019. The Australian nationally representative sample of 1,098 adults aged 18+ was weighted</p>
      <p>Almost nine in 10 (87%) of Australian respondents agree that a longer manufacturer warranty means a higher product quality and that a longer manufacturer warranty gives them certainty that what they buy is of good value.</p>
      <p>The research also reveals Australian consumers consider brands that offer manufacturer warranty periods longer than competitors more trustworthy (87%).</p>
      <p>Furthermore, most Australian respondents (89%) consider larger than average manufacturer warranty periods proof that a brand is confident in the quality of its products.</p>
      <p>According to Jason McLean, director – consumer imaging, Canon Australia, the company’s new five-year camera warranty for mirrorless, DSLR, digital video camera and lens product ranges responds to Australian consumers’ expectations for longer warranties to apply to higher-end products that represent a significant investment.</p>
      <p>“Consumer expectations have evolved due to the rise of a new ‘transient goods’ mindset and consumer electronic brands setting low expectations for the quality of their products by offering shorter than appropriate warranties,” McLean said.</p>
      <p>“It is time for brands in the industry to modernise their manufacturer warranties to reflect consumer expectations of quality, trust and good value.”</p>
      <p>“At the end of the day, every brand should be providing products that offer the most value and the best possible experience to its consumers.”</p>
      <p>“If Aussie consumer electronic brands are confident in the quality of their higher-end products, why wouldn’t they follow our lead in backing it with an appropriate manufacturer warranty?”</p>
