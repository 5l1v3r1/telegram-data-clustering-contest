      <p>Taylor Swift's big night at the American Music Awards has begun. The singer, who will receive the Artist of the Decade award tonight, hit the red carpet in glittery green asymmetrical dress. She wore her hair half-up, half-down and walked the carpet solo.</p>

      <p>Swift's drama with Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta over whether or not she could perform her old music (her former record label Big Machine Label Group owns her early catalog) during the ceremony generated a lot of headlines over the last week.</p>
      <p>Swift posted an open letter about the situation on her Tumblr last week. On Monday, Big Machine Label Group and the AMA's producer Dick Clark Productions released contradictory statements regarding Swift's ability to play her old music.</p>
      <p>Big Machine said, "The Big Machine Label Group and Dick Clark Productions announce that they have come to terms on a licensing agreement that approves their artists’ performances to stream post-show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platforms. This includes the upcoming American Music Awards performance. It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media. Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists’ audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed.”</p>
      <p>Then Dick Clark Productions denied putting a statement out with them: “At no time did Dick Clark Productions agree to, create, authorize or distribute a statement in partnership with Big Machine Label Group regarding Taylor Swift’s performance at the 2019 American Music Awards. Any final agreement on this matter needs to be made directly with Taylor Swift’s management team. We have no further comment.”</p>
