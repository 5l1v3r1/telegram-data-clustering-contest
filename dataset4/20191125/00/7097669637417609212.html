      <p>LONDON, Nov 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - LGBT+ people have seen a rise in tolerance in almost every region of the world over the last decade, according to an index released on Monday.</p>
      <p>Iceland was named as the most tolerant country towards LGBT+ people in a survey of 167 countries by British think-tank the Legatum Institute, while central Asian country Tajikistan was in last place.</p>
      <p>"It is encouraging to see that our 2019 Prosperity Index shows a rise in tolerance towards the LGBT community globally over the past decade," Shaun Flanagan of the institute's Centre for Metrics told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
      <p>"However, the LGBT community, as well as other often marginalised groups, such as immigrants, ethnic minorities and religious groups, still face considerable persecution across certain parts of the world today."</p>
      <p>The data is part of the 2019 Legatum Prosperity Index, which measures a host of factors affecting countries' ability to create wealth and wellbeing, ranging from investment environment to health and personal freedom.</p>
      <p>Social tolerance towards minority groups increased in 111 of 167 countries over the last decade, and across every region except for Eastern Europe &amp; Sub-Saharan Africa, it found.</p>
      <p>The rise in acceptance of LGBT+ people was particularly marked, rising from about one in four people expressing acceptance a decade ago to almost a third in the latest report.</p>
      <p>Tolerance towards LGBT+ people was measured according to responses to a Gallup poll that asked more than 130,000 people around the world whether their city or area was a good place for gay and lesbian people to live.</p>
      <p>Top-ranking Iceland was followed by The Netherlands and Norway in the 2019 index, while Canada and Denmark took fourth and fifth place respectively.</p>
      <p>Several of the least tolerant countries criminalise homosexuality, with penalties including a potential death sentence for men in Mauritania and Somalia, both in the bottom five.</p>
      <p>However, legality did not always equal acceptance - lowest-ranked Tajikistan decriminalised gay sex in 1998 but LGBT+ people still face widespread discrimination.</p>
      <p>It was followed by Somalia, Azerbaijan, Senegal and Mauritania in second to fourth last place respectively. (Reporting by Sonia Elks @soniaelks; Editing by Claire Cozens.
