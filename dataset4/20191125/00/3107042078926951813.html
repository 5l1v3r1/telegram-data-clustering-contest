      <p>The latest round of the South Otago T20 cricket competition has thrown the door wide open as the finals weekend approaches.</p>
      <p>Four teams are still in with a shot of making the final with one round remaining.</p>
      <p>Each of them plays one of the others next week and the two winning sides are most likely to meet in the final on December 7 in Balclutha.</p>
      <p>The bottom-of-the-table Waihola Swans gave the Kai Kings their first defeat of the season, winning by six runs in Milton. Waihola scored 129 for five. Shannon Young scored 41 in an innings which featured some very nicely timed shots.</p>
      <p>Kellan Crowie (30) and Brad Williams (35) were strong towards the end of the innings.</p>
      <p>Jason Young was the pick of the Kings bowlers, taking two for 14. In reply the Kings made 123, six runs short of the total after batting out their 20 overs.</p>
      <p>Opening batsman Orry Young continued his form with the bat. Young hit 54 runs, including three fours and three sixes. Jason Young (13) and Mark Shepherd (12) were the only other Kai batsmen to make double figures.</p>
      <p>Crowie continued his solid day out with three for 14 off four overs.</p>
      <p>The Valley Stingers have put themselves firmly back in the finals mix after their four-wicket win over the Lawrence Lions in Lawrence.</p>
      <p>The home side was dismissed for 95. Captain Sam Wyber top-scored with 36.</p>
      <p>Jordan McEntee hit 29 but none of the other Lions batsmen fired.</p>
      <p>South Otago cricket veterans Lachie Johnston and Marc Phillips bowled extremely well for the Stingers. Johnston took a hat trick and Phillips also showed his class with three for three off four overs.</p>
      <p>The Stingers chased down the total from the final ball of the innings for the loss of five wickets.</p>
      <p>Johnston was once again in the thick of things, scoring 29 runs at the top of the order.</p>
      <p>Jordan McEntee was the best of the Lions bowlers with two for 35 off four overs.</p>
      <p>The Owaka Bandits had a comfortable eight-wicket win against the Clutha Comets at the Outlaw Oval in Owaka. Clutha was skittled for 60 inside 14 overs.</p>
      <p>The fired-up Bandits fielding unit gave nothing away.</p>
      <p>Connor Smith was the only Comets batsman to reach double figures, ending the innings not out on 21.</p>
      <p>Jacob Beal-Harris was the most effective of the Bandits bowlers, taking three for 14 off four overs.</p>
      <p>In reply the Bandits reached the target for the loss of three wickets in the 14th over. Beal-Harris continued his individually brilliant day with 37 runs.</p>
