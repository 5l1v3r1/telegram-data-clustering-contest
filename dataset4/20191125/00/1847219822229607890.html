        <b>In UK’s snap election aimed at overcoming the Brexit impasse, the country’s ruling Conservative Party seeks to win with a pledge to leave the European Union and to be stricter on immigration.</b>
      </p>
      <p>British public broadcaster BBC reports that Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged tighter immigration controls and not to increase rates of income tax, national insurance and value-added tax.</p>
      <p>Speaking at its launch in Telford, Shropshire, the prime minister said the choice facing the country in this «closely fought» contest had «never been starker».</p>
      <p>«Get Brexit done and we can focus our hearts and minds on the priorities of the British people,» he underlined.</p>
      <p>The manifesto, which the PM described as a «partial blueprint» for the future of the country, promises 20,000 more police officers and to «level up» schools funding, BBC reports.</p>
      <p>The parliamentary election is to take place on December 12.</p>
