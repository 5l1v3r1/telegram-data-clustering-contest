      <h1>Test Mind the Speed and get 3 months free uncapped fibre on Openserve</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/partner" target="_blank">Partner</a></address>
      <p>Mind the Speed is running a <a href="https://www.mindthespeed.co.za/?utm_source=MyBroadband&amp;utm_medium=ArticleNovember1"><b>free fibre promotion</b></a> for new clients.</p>
      <p>To take part, users who have an active Openserve fibre line can sign up with Mind the Speed and receive one month of free uncapped fibre.</p>
      <p>This gives you the ability to test Mind the Speed’s network for free.</p>
      <p>If you decide you would not like to continue with Mind the Speed at the end of the month, you can cancel your account without any penalties.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.mindthespeed.co.za/?utm_source=MyBroadband&amp;utm_medium=ArticleNovember1">
            <b>Sign up for the Mind the Speed fibre special</b>
          </a>
          <b> with the code: OSPROMO001</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The special is available for all orders received before 29 November 2019, and users will not have to migrate their Openserve fibre line from their existing ISP to take advantage.</p>
      <p>“We will simply supply you with access details to load onto your existing router,” said Mind the Speed.</p>
      <h3>3 months free uncapped fibre</h3>
      <p>Sweetening the deal is the fact that if a user decides to continue with their Mind the Speed uncapped fibre account after the first month, they will receive the next two months free.</p>
      <p>This means your first three months of uncapped fibre will not cost you a cent.</p>
      <p>Mind the Speed stated that if a user signs up after the first month, they will be required to migrate their Openserve fibre line to Mind the Speed.</p>
      <p>“Should you decide to proceed with us, and you need to give your current ISP a calendar months’ notice, the two months free will only start from the time your fibre line is migrated,” said Mind the Speed.</p>
      <p>Should a user opt to keep the account active during the migration period, this will form part of the two months free.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clients must use the code <b>OSPROMO001</b> in the promotional code field when <a href="https://www.mindthespeed.co.za/?utm_source=MyBroadband&amp;utm_medium=ArticleNovember1"><b>signing up</b></a> on the Mind the Speed website.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Moving to Mind the Speed</h3>
      <p>Mind the Speed stated that there are several important elements to note about the free fibre promotion:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There will be no cost to migrate your fibre service.</li>
        <li>Mind the Speed will provide clients with a free Wi-Fi router, or subsidize the purchase of their preferred router, if they sign up.</li>
        <li>Many ISPs require their clients to give them a calendar months’ notice before they can cancel and move their fibre line – and may apply cancellation costs.</li>
      </ul>
