      <h1>Refs Call A Joke Of A Penalty Late In Cowboys-Patriots Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:31:52+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The Dallas Cowboys have made several mistakes in tonight’s game against the New England Patriots. So, too, have the referees.</p>
      <p>Dallas was called for a drive-killing “tripping” penalty on a 3rd down play late in the fourth quarter against New England. We’re not really sure what the referee saw on the play.</p>
      <p>Cowboys center Travis Frederick did lift his leg a bit, but it hardly seemed to have an effect on the play. The Patriots’ defender appeared to be falling to the ground and was already being blocked by another lineman.</p>
      <p>Dallas was then pushed back 10 yards and was unable to convert. The Patriots took over and were able to run the clock out for the win, 13-9.</p>
      <p>Cowboys fans are furious with the game-deciding call.</p>
      <p>They’re not the only ones upset, either.</p>
      <p>“This is the exact opposite of a tripping. He moved out of the way to avoid tripping the defender. This BS has to stop. Please NFL. Stop this,” former NFL lineman Geoff Schwartz tweeted.</p>

      <p>It was the second time the Cowboys were called for a questionable “tripping” penalty.</p>
      <p>“The Cowboys have been called for tripping twice today. Neither was a good call. Just awful officiating,” ESPN’s Todd Archer tweeted.</p>

      <p>NFL Network host Rich Eisen didn’t hold back, either.</p>

      <p>The Cowboys didn’t “deserve” to win this game, but they deserved a chance to win it late, and the referees took it away from them with a terrible penalty call.</p>
      <p>New England improves to 10-1 with today’s win, while Dallas falls to 6-5.</p>
