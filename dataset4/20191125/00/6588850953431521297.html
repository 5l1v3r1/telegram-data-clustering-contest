      <p>The National Zongo Caucus of the National Democratic Congress [NDC] says Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia has “disrespected” the National Chief Imam at the just ended national religious event to celebrate the birth of Prophet Mohammed - known as the Maulid, at New Fadama. <br/><br/>The group in a statement signed by its Communication Officer, Alhaj Mohammed Naziru said the Vice President and the NPP used the ‘holy occasion’ for their political activities – something which was barred by political parties.<br/><br/>They are however calling on the Vice President to apologize to the Chief Imam and the whole Muslim community.<br/><br/><i>“The National Zongo caucus of the NDC demands an unqualified apology from the vice president and the entire NPP for the embarrassment caused the National Chief Imam, the Muslim Ummah and the entire nation in the presence of foreign diplomats and some international media,”</i> a portion on the statement said.<br/><br/><b>Read full statement…</b><br/><br/>The National Zongo Caucus of the National Democratic Congress(NDC) has observed with with great concern the crass disregard by the vice president H.E Alhaj Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia and the governing New Patriotic Party(NPP) to the clear directives by the National Chief Imam(Sheikh Osman Nuhu Sharubutu) not to entertain any party politics at the just ended 2019 National religious event to celebrate the birth of Prophet Mohammed(S.A.W) known as the Maulid, at New Fadama on Saturday, 23rd November, 2019.<br/><br/>It is Sene qua num to note that, all the political parties who were invited to the event were notified by the organising committee of the Maulid, of the clear directives from National Chief Imam not to turn the obvious religious event into partisan politics in order to maintain the National character of the annual event.<br/><br/>We in the NDC in reverence to the high office of the National Chief Imam and in line with our position to call for a 'No' vote in the upcoming referendum to avoid the near poisoning of everything in the country with partisan politics, adhered to the directives of the National Chief imam.<br/><br/>To the dismay of the NDC National Zongo caucus and all participants at the 2019 Maulid, the vice President of the Republic of Ghana H.E Dr Mahmudu Bawmia was ushered into the event by NPP fanatics clouded in NPP party colors singing and chanting NPP slogans with megaphones to signify it is a well orchestrated plan to defy the Chief Imam, a situation that prompted the Master of ceremony(MC) to reprimand the vice president's entourage, albeit after the harm has been done and the vice president had taken his seat.<br/><br/>For us in the zongo caucus, this is a blatant disrespect to the Chief Imam and the moslem ummah from national and international who graced the occasion, also, this gross violation of a simple and befitting directives by the the National Chief Imam by no less a person than the vice president of the republic who should know better the need to make national events remain national, devoid of partisanship, goes to confirm our strong held believe to the effect that it's a dress rehearsal by the NPP to countinue in their disregard to the rules of engagement in all National events especially in the upcoming 2020 election, in order to skew the outcome of the said election to their favor come what may.<br/><br/>This should serve as a wake up call to all well meaning Ghanaians to call the NPP to order and save our dear country Ghana, from any further embarrassment both locally and internationally.<br/><br/>In view of the above, the National Zongo caucus of the NDC demands an unqualified apology from the Vice president (H.E Dr. Bawmia) and the entire NPP for the embarrassment caused the National Chief Imam, the Muslim Ummah and the entire Nation in the presence of foreign Diplomats and some international Media.<br/><br/>Finally, the National Zongo caucus of the NDC extend it sincere appreciation to all, for the rousing welcome accorded the former President and flag bearer of the NDC for the 2020 National elections (H.E John Dramani Mahama) at the 2019 Maulid under the auspices of the National Chief Imam and Grand Mufti of the Republic Ghana.<br/><br/>Alhaj Mohammed Naziru<br/>(Com.
