        <i>“Nigerians have expressed diverse opinions and reservations on the proposed bill, it is democracy in action, this ninth Senate which I am part of, is listening and your representatives are ready to accommodate all your grievances, I Senator Ibrahim Shekarau APC-K Central, will practically lead in advocating an all-encompassing and the best-accommodating legislation for Nigeria and Nigerians in this regard”.</i>
      </p>
      <p>He stated that in this digital world it is more advantageous to fight against corruption, unemployment and improve the country with all media platforms.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Even the advanced democracies and knowledge-based economies are finding it challenging to curtail misinformation and misuse of these tools, but we at the same time must devise ways to address these issues in the interest of our overall national security, social harmony and political stability”.</i>
