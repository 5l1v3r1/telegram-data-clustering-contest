      <p>Gdansk - The port of Gdansk has launched <b>the first permanent railway connection </b>of the Euro China Train. The train will regularly arrive from Xi’an in China via the Adampol Małaszewicze land terminal to the DCT maritime container terminal in the Port of Gdańsk.</p>
      <p>The arrival of the train<b> opens a whole new chapter in the context of intermodal transport </b>and the “One Belt, One Road” concept, which involves creating a fast and secure connection between China and the rest of the world. From the very beginning, Poland was an important and integral part of this initiative.</p>
      <p>The time it takes for rail freight from China to reach the Małaszewicze terminal, one of the largest railway terminals of international importance in Poland, ranges <b>from 9 to 10 days</b>. Travel time from Małaszewicze to Gdansk is only 1 or 2 days, and it is possible to shorten the whole transit even to 10 days. Another train from China is scheduled to arrive in December, and regular weekly transports on this route will start as early as in January 2020.</p>
      <p>“The new rail link from China directly to the Port of Gdańsk is an alternative to Western European ports, which significantly reduces the time of container delivery to the Scandinavian and British markets. We see it as an opportunity to use our highly developed network of connections and transhipment infrastructure,” said Łukasz Greinke, the <b>President of the Port of Gdańsk Authority S.A.</b>, present at the event. “Thanks to this solution we are able to accelerate the transport of goods from China up to as many as 5 days. It is also important to remember that there are fewer operations on the container, which translates into lower costs. From now on, the Port of Gdańsk can offer a faster, cheaper and more competitive service than the current solutions.”</p>
