      <p>Sunday night on Survivor Series, one key voice was missing in a competitive exhibition between Raw, SmackDown and NXT. Fresh off another strong performance at WWE NXT TakeOver: War Games, Mauro Ranallo was absent from commentary at WWE Survivor Series, with Michael Cole noting the absence was due to Ranallo “blowing his voice out” while calling the pay-per-view.</p>
      <p>Few fans believed this line as Ranallo suspiciously <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/nxt-lead-announcer-mauro-ranallo-deletes-twitter-account-662652/">deleted his Twitter account</a> shortly after WWE SmackDown announcer Corey Graves seemed to throw shade at the lead commentator, who notably struggles from bipolar disorder.</p>
      <p>To be sure, Graves was also critical of Ranallo’s constant hip hop references.</p>
      <p>Despite the company line from Cole, Bryan Alvarez of F4WOnline <a href="https://twitter.com/bryanalvarez/status/1198764547823169536">uncategorically tweeted</a> that Ranallo was out due to the tweets from Graves.</p>
      <p>Ranallo was the subject of a Showtime documentary <i>Bipolar Rock N’ Roller, </i>and went through a similar episode during <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2017/04/07/wwe-john-bradshaw-layfield-might-still-have-workplace-bullying-problems/">another apparent feud</a> with a fellow commentator in John Bradshaw Layfield.</p>
      <p>With mental health becoming more of a serious topic of discussion in the workplace, as it should be, and Twitter becoming increasingly more acerbic—which it shouldn’t be—many fans have taken to Twitter to voice their displeasure with Graves while sending well wishes to Ranallo. It was noted that Ranallo, who trended worldwide on Twitter during Survivor Series, will be back Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Interesting how WWE is so confident he’ll be back despite the fact that he “blew out his voice.”</p>
