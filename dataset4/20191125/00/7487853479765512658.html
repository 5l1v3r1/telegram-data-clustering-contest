      <p>We're well into the season now, and if you haven't figured it out already, yes, football never stops!</p>
      <p>Monday night sees Newcastle, currently 14th in the Premier League, take on Aston Villa, 17th, as both sides look to push themselves away from the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>There's a return to Villa Park for Steve Bruce, now Magpies boss, as he looks to get one over successor Dean Smith.</p>

      <h3>​Magpies Making Mockery of Measly...Villans</h3>

      <p>​Aston Villa have a bad recent record against ​Newcastle, being winless against the Magpies in their last six league home games. The previous two top flight meetings between the teams at Villa Park have both finished 0-0.</p>
      <p>Newcastle boast the more positive record between the pair. Steve Bruce's side are unbeaten in their last 12 meetings with Aston Villa - winning six and drawing six - since a 1-0 loss at Villa Park in April 2011.</p>
      <p>So, if the recent past is anything to go by, Newcastle ought to fancy their chances.</p>

      <h3>Yeah Yeah, Feeling Bad on a Monday</h3>

        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fleicester-city-v-newcastle-united-premier-league-5ddc14378a147a4ddb000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.947177093059446&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=0.9971428571428571&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.05088702147525677&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.002857142857142857&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>

      <p>That being said, Newcastle tend not to like the start of the working week, especially if they have to play a game on a Monday.</p>
      <p>They've lost 12 of their last 15 Premier League games played on a Monday - winning two and drawing one - but they have avoided defeat in three of their last five. </p>
      <p>All 15 of those games have been played away from home, because Sky don't like the thought of a Monday night in Newcastle, apparently.</p>

      <h3>Big Lads Coming Up for the Corner</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fwest-ham-united-v-newcastle-united-premier-league-5ddc144e727cd9d950000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.9760348583877995&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>

      <p>Newcastle's forwards are having the year off, it would seem. Joelinton and Miguel Almiron just don't fancy scoring goals or assisting their teammates, so they've let the club's defenders do all the heavy lifting thus far.</p>
      <p>Seven of Newcastle’s last nine Premier League goals have been scored by defenders. With 64%, Newcastle lead the Premier League this season in goals to have been scored by defenders.</p>
      <p>So, Tyrone and Bjorn, it would be a good idea to watch out for Federico Fernandez, Ciaran Clark and Paul Dummett at corners.</p>
      <p>On top of that, no side has conceded more headed goals in the Premier League this season than Aston Villa. It's going to be a set-piece game and it's going to be box office.</p>

      <h3>Can't Stop Scoring</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fwolverhampton-wanderers-v-aston-villa-premier-league-5ddc149f727cd97e1d000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8888888888888888&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.06666666666666667&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>

      <p>Aston Villa forward Trezeguet has scored in his last two Premier League games – the last player to score in three in a row in the top flight for the Villans was Tom Cleverley in May 2015.</p>
      <p>I don't remember Tom Cleverley playing for Villa either, if that helps.</p>

      <h3>Buck Your Ideas Up</h3>

      <p>While <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/aston-villa">​Villa</a> can't overtake <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/newcastle">​Newcastle</a> this week even if they do win on Monday night, it would go a long way in stretching the gap between themselves and 18th placed Norwich.</p>
      <p>But they'll need to overturn some rubbish recent form to do so.</p>
      <p>The Villans have lost their last three <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier League</a> games, last enduring a longer run of defeats in the competition between February-April 2016 (11). That was the season they got relegated without as much as a whimper.</p>
