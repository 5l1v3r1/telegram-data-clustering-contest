      <p>The United Kingdom (UK) Conservatives will “get Brexit done” and “forge a new Britain”, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said while launching the party’s election manifesto.</p>
      <p>He promised 50,000 more nurses in England and the creation of 50 million more GP appointments.</p>
      <p>Other “guarantees” include tighter immigration controls and not to increase rates of income tax, national insurance and VAT.</p>
      <p>The 59-page manifesto comes 18 days before the general election.</p>
      <p>Speaking at its launch in Telford, Shropshire, the prime minister said the choice facing the country in this “closely fought” contest had “never been starker”.</p>
      <p>“Get Brexit done and we can focus our hearts and minds on the priorities of the British people,” he added.</p>
      <p>The manifesto, which the PM described as a “partial blueprint” for the future of the country, promises 20,000 more police officers and to “level up” schools funding.</p>
      <p>Nursing maintenance bursaries scrapped in 2016 will be restored, at an estimated cost of £760m in 2020-21, rising to £880m in 2023-4.</p>
      <p>Other policies include:</p>
      <p>A “triple tax lock”, ruling out increases in the headline rate of income tax and National Insurance, as well as VAT, for five years.</p>
      <p>Raising the National Insurance threshold to £9,500 in 2020, with an ambition to raise it further to £12,500.</p>
      <p>Childcare: £250m a year, for at least three years, plus a £250m capital spending boost, for “wraparound” childcare – meaning after school or during holidays.</p>
      <p>Environment: £6.3bn for upgrades to homes, such as grants for improving boilers and insulation.</p>
