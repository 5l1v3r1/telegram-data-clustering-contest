      <p>PRAGUE (AP) - World No. 2 Karolina Pliskova has hired Daniel Vallverdu as coach to replace Conchita Martinez.</p>
      <p>Vallverdu, who previously was part of the coaching teams of Andy Murray, Stanislas Wawrinka, Tomas Berdych and Juan Martin Del Potro, will aim to help Pliskova succeed at Grand Slams.</p>
      <p>Her best so far at the major tournaments was the US Open final in 2016, when she lost to Angelique Kerber.</p>
      <p>Pliskova has a decent season behind her, winning four of her 15 WTA titles. The 27-year Czech decided to part ways with Martinez after she reached the semifinals of the WTA Finals earlier in November.</p>
      <p>She said it was time for her “to move forward.”</p>
