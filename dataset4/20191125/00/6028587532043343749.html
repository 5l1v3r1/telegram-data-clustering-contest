      <p>In the last week the three major UK-wide political parties have launched their manifestos as part of the process before election day on December 12th. Whilst much has been made of the role of technology in modern-day electioneering, what do they have to say about issues of technology?The single technology issue that gets the most coverage from either <a href="https://labour.org.uk/manifesto/">Labour</a> or <a href="https://vote.conservatives.com/our-plan">Conservative </a>Parties is the roll-out of (speed unspecified) broadband across homes and businesses in the next decade.</p>

      <p>Labour's well-publicized policy is to deliver a new, state-owned organization British Broadband, which will be founded through the nationalization of parts of the existing BT (formerly British Telecom, a commercial organisation privatised in the 1980s). British Digital Infrastructure (BDI) will be responsible for delivering "full fibre" to every home and business by 2030, with British Broadband Services providing the day-to-day service operation.</p>
      <p>The Conservative Party, unsurprisingly, fall back on the private sector to deliver "gigabit capable" connections to all homes by 2025. Among other things they then describe as being a part of refocusing on the self-employed, and how broadband can help to promote home working. That home working isn't just confined to the ranks of the self-employed is somehow lost along the way.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.libdems.org.uk/plan">Liberal Democrats</a> are the only party to actually define the speed of the broadband that they are committing to. Unfortunately, they'll only guarantee that all homes have Fibre to the Cabinet, specified at 30Mbps download/6Mbps upload.</p>

        <figcaption>LONDON, ENGLAND - NOVEMBER 20: Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson launches the Liberal Democrat ... [+] election manifesto at FEST Camden on November 20, 2019 in London, England. The Liberal Democrats election manifesto includes plans to halt Brexit and invest the £50 million remain bonus in public services. They also plan to generate 80 per cent of energy from renewables by 2030, provide £10,000 for skills and training to every adult, free child care from 9 months and recruiting 20,000 more teachers. The Liberal Democrats are fielding 611 candidates in the General Election on December 12th, including 188 women. (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)<cite>Getty Images</cite></figcaption>

      <p>The LibDems, however, are the party to give most thought to changing and emerging technologies, with a fair amount of detail about how Artificial Intelligence and data harvesting techniques should be made subject to ethical regulation, a so-called "Lovelace Code".</p>
      <p>That forms part of a broader UK2050 Innovation strategy - which includes a focus on digital literacy, and develop mechanisms so that the public can "share in the profits made by tech companies in the use of their data". Quite what these are aren't, however, specified.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives want to generally leave things to the market, but want more regulation of the Internet to protect us from bad things and terrorists. They also want to set up a new "High Risk/High Pay-off" quango that will make R&amp;D investments in new technologies. How this is different from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk">Innovate UK</a> isn't clear.</p>
      <p>Labour will establish a new Minister for Cyber Security. Both Labour and Conservatives see that increasing automation will require a new approach to life-long learning.</p>
      <p>As a slight relief, none of the major parties claim that Blockchain is the answer to any pressing societal issue. There are no mentions of distributed ledgers in any of the documents. Data hardly gets a mention other in the context of privacy either.</p>
      <p>So if you are looking for significant policy statements other than regarding broadband strategy from one of the major parties, the Lib Dems are the people who have given it most thought. But that's only because the others appear to have given it so little.</p>
