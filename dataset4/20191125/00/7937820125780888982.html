      </h3>
      <p>Meteorologists are worried about a ruling last week that means 5G signals could muddy the radio frequencies used to gather crucial weather and climate data. To give companies a leg up as they implement the new super-fast wireless technology, regulators will allow <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03609-x">eight years of slightly relaxed standards for how much noise from 5G signals is allowed to leak</a> into neighbouring frequencies. Water vapour in the atmosphere naturally produces a weak signal near 24 gigahertz, which satellites use to measure humidity and which sits perilously close to the bands designated for the 5G roll-out.</p>

      <p>Researchers who do their work at institutions in China now make up the second-largest group in the Web of Science’ s list of most-cited scientists. For the first time, the number of <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/china-overtakes-uk-in-list-of-highly-cited-researchers/4010733.article">China-based researchers has leapfrogged the number who work in the United Kingdom</a>. But neither group comes close to first place: almost half of the most-cited researchers on the list work at institutions in the United States, while Germany and Australia round out the top five.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Scientists have come up with a more accurate way to calculate dog lifespan in human years, putting paid to the rule of thumb saying that one human year is equivalent to seven dog years. They analysed the DNA of 104 labrador retrievers and looked at how their ageing marks compare with those of humans. The work aimed to investigate how such epigenetic markers work across species, but also resulted in <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/11/here-s-better-way-convert-dog-years-human-years-scientists-say">a formula for calculating a canine’s age in human years</a>: roughly 16 ln(dog age) + 31.

      <p>The lack of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03618-w">competent, witty female elders in science-fiction</a> novels reflects ageism and sexism in the here and now, argues Nebula-nominated author Sylvia Spruck Wrigley.

      </h3>
      <p>Decades ago, tobacco companies turned the scientific concept of transparency into a weapon when it demanded scientists’ raw data — and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking a page from the same playbook, argues a bipartisan opinion article from two former government scientists. Public-health researcher Bernard Goldstein, a senior EPA scientist under Ronald Reagan, and David Michaels, who ran the Occupational Safety and Health Administration under Barack Obama, explore how “opponents of public health protections invoke a caricature of how science really works”.</p>

      <h4>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h4>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://provost.indiana.edu/statements/index.html">“My strong disagreement with his views — indeed, the fact that I find them loathsome — is not a reason for Indiana University to violate the Constitution of the United States.”</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Lauren Robel, executive vice-president and provost of Indiana University Bloomington, explains how the university is responding to a professor who expressed discriminatory views. (<a href="https://provost.indiana.edu/statements/index.html">Statement on the IU Bloomington website</a>)</p>

      <p>Forget world peace — can you imagine <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h63IncBjFKGalfvgSNkkwQ7p7HQkHN3aU-VLRju8Jps/edit">a week without meetings</a>?
