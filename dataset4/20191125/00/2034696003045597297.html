      <p>Joining Will Ferrell, who returned to host the show for a fifth time, King Princess performed her debut single ‘1950’ along with ‘Hit the Back’ from her recently released album, <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/king-princess-cheap-queen-review">‘Cheap Queen’</a>.</p>
      <p>In a four-star <i>NME</i> review, Thomas Hobb said of Mikaela Straus and ‘Cheap Queen’: “The Mark Ronson-endorsed New Yorker recalibrates the traditional love song for an LGBTQ audience and her debut studio album soars at its most experimental.”</p>
