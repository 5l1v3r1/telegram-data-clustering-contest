      <p>A group led by Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp will buy Eneco in a deal valuing the Dutch energy firm at 4.1 billion euros ($4.52 billion), Eneco said on Monday, beating off rival bids from Shell and private equity firm KKR.</p>
      <p>Eneco, a company owned by 44 Dutch municipalities and with a strong focus on renewable energy, said it had been swayed by Mitsubishi’s plans to allow the company to continue its strategy and retain its corporate identity.</p>
      <p>The deal, backed by Eneco’s boards and a committee representing shareholders, must still be approved early next year by the Dutch company’s municipal investors.</p>
      <p>Eneco said Mitsubishi’s group had “made the best offer for shareholders and all other stakeholders of Eneco, including employees.”</p>
      <p>Mitsubishi’s win is a blow for Shell, which wants to become a major power generator by 2030. New Energies director Maarten Wetselaar said in response to the announcement that Shell would “continue to look for opportunities in the energy transition.”</p>
      <p>Oil and gas major Shell, which said it planned to spend an average of $2 billion to $3 billion dollars a year on energy transition investments from 2021 onwards, had teamed up with Dutch pension fund manager PGGM in its bid to buy Eneco.</p>
      <p>Private equity firm KKR, which was also beaten in the bidding, had lined up with Dutch lender Rabobank.</p>
      <p>Mitsubishi’s consortium planned to invest 1 billion euros in Eneco’s operations in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium in the next three years, Eneco chief financial officer Guido Dubbeld told in a call with journalists.</p>
      <p>He said the investment would be made “mostly in the Netherlands, mostly in wind, somewhat less in solar.”</p>
      <p>The deal will give Mitsubishi 80 per cent of Eneco and its partner Chubu a 20 per cent stake.</p>
      <p>“Eneco fits perfectly with our current energy activities and offers us a platform from which to grow further in the European market,” Mitsubishi Chief Executive Takehiko Kakiuchi said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Mitsubishi already owned 400 megawatts (MW) of Dutch offshore wind power and would combine those operations with Eneco, the Dutch company said.</p>
      <p>In September, Eneco reported first half earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 272 million euros ($303 million) for the first half of 2019, up from 230 million euros a year earlier.</p>
