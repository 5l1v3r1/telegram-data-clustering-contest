      <p>The Sekondi-Takoradi Metropolitan Assembly (STMA) has distributed items worth GH¢34,650 to a total of 37 Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) in Sekondi to help them become active members of society.</p>
      <p>The release of support items which is the final distribution for this year fulfills government’s promise to improve the lives of PWDs in all areas of the country.</p>
      <p>The government’s promise to actively contribute to the lives of PWDs through donations aims to enable them to become part of society because they have been marginalised for a long time.</p>
      <p>The beneficiaries received support in the form of laptops, toiletries, provisions, popcorn machines, ice chests, chest freezer, and bags of sachet water, among others.</p>
      <p>Metropolitan Chief Executive (MCE) of STMA, Anthony Sam, who presented the items to beneficiaries stated that three percent of the district assembly's common fund allocated to PWDs was used in purchasing the items for the beneficiaries.</p>
      <p>He disclosed that the money had been gathered quarterly to enable the Assembly to accumulate enough funds to be used in buying the items needed by the beneficiaries.</p>
      <p>A person with disability cannot benefit from the support programme more than once.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the MCE advised beneficiaries to put what they received to good use so that they can improve their livelihood and eventually become independent.</p>
      <p>Mr Sam cautioned against the recipients who operated shops and other businesses not to sell their goods on credit basis to avoid the collapse of their businesses.</p>
      <p>He also asked them to exercise diligence in their businesses to sustain its growth.</p>
