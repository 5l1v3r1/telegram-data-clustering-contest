      <p>COLLEGEVILLE, Pa. (AP) - Bill Cosby says he’s prepared to serve his 10-year maximum sentence for sexual assault rather than show remorse for a crime the comedian says he didn’t commit.</p>
      <p>Cosby is serving three to 10 years in a state prison near Philadelphia after a jury last year convicted him of sexually assaulting a Temple University employee in 2004. The 82-year-old says the Pennsylvania parole board is “not going to hear me say that I have remorse.” He thinks it’s therefore unlikely he’ll be released early.</p>
      <p>He made the comments in a phone interview Sunday with BlackPressUSA as he appeals his felony conviction and sex offender status.</p>
      <p>Legal experts say sex offenders typically must show remorse to be considered for parole.</p>

        <p>Cosby is best known for his 1980s-era sitcom, “The Cosby Show.”</p>
