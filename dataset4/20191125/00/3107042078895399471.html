      <p>Korea’s national airline has announced a new direct seasonal charter programme between Seoul and Christchurch this summer.</p>
      <p>The first Korean Air flight will land in Christchurch on December 28 and run weekly till February 21.</p>
      <p>Christchurch Airport chief aeronautical and commercial officer Justin Watson said the service is a response to the increasing numbers of Korean visitors coming to the South Island.</p>
      <p>“Our Korean arrival numbers have grown 39 per cent over the past five years and this charter service is seen as a trial, which may lead to more flights the following year,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Analysis suggests the Korean visitors off the charter service will spend about $7 million during their time in the South Island, so it’s a win-win for both the visitors and the island’s regions.”</p>
      <p>The new service is the result of a concerted effort by the airport, Tourism New Zealand and other government agencies working together with South Korean travel sellers.</p>
      <p>Tourism New Zealand director commercial Rene de Monchy welcomed the announcement.</p>
      <p>“Tourism New Zealand has increased its marketing effort and investment in South Korea to help stimulate demand for travel to New Zealand,” he said.</p>
      <p>“This series of flights direct into the South Island will provide our Korean visitors greater choice and flexibility in travelling to New Zealand for their holiday."</p>
