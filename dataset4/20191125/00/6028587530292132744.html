      <p>WWE Survivor Series 2019 was one of the company’s best pay-per-views of 2019, highlighted by Brock Lesnar retaining his WWE title against Rey Mysterio, Adam Cole and Pete Dunne tearing the house down, and a tremendously effective battle between Bray Wyatt and Daniel Bryan.The buildup to Survivor Series ranked among the most intriguing PPV buildups we’ve seen in years, focusing heavily on a tri-branded rivalry among Raw, SmackDown and NXT. Despite the weeks leading to the pay-per-view featuring some of the most high quality storytelling we’ve seen in 2019, that wasn’t exactly reflected in viewership for most of the three shows. Raw consistently hovered around <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/this-week-taped-wwe-raw-episode-draws-lowest-viewership-in-662093/">historic viewership lows</a> while <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/wwe-smackdown-viewership-down-from-overnight-numbers-and-662374/">SmackDown’s audience</a> has continued to disappoint, and NXT–despite <a href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2019/11/21/20976687/nxt-beats-aew-ratings-viewership-nov-20-2019-wednesday-night-war-wwe">topping AEW this week</a>–still remains well below one million viewers.</p>
      <p>That’s a discouraging sign because the buzz and excitement in route to Survivor Series seemed to be there, and the pay-per-view itself featured a handful of good to great matches and some very intriguing storyline developments. Although the official road to WrestleMania 36 typically doesn’t kick off until The Royal Rumble in January, it appeared that some seeds were planted for a few blockbuster matches on the grandest stage of them all next April.</p>
      <p>What were the most important developments inside the Allstate Arena? Here are the five biggest takeaways from Survivor Series 2019.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WWE Wants NXT To Be An Equal To Raw And SmackDown</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>In route to Survivor Series, Triple H made it clear that NXT was going to make a statement and demonstrate why the yellow brand is equivalent to Raw and SmackDown.</p>
      <p>For most of its existence, NXT has been considered to be WWE’s “developmental territory,” but it now finds itself in this weird position in which it is functioning as both that developmental territory and a full-fledged third brand. NXT is Triple H’s pet project, and given that many of WWE’s top stars came through NXT first–including Seth Rollins, Roman Reigns and Becky Lynch, among others–the lead-up to Survivor Series was all about portraying NXT as that third brand as opposed to simply being a place where WWE grooms its next crop of superstars.</p>
      <p>That also held true at Survivor Series itself, where NXT had a strong showing with a whopping four victories over Raw (one) and SmackDown (two) and memorable in-ring performances from stars like Keith Lee and Roderick Strong, among others. As of right now and likely for the foreseeable future, NXT isn’t going to come close to Raw or SmackDown in terms of TV viewership, mainstream appeal or overall star power, but that won’t prevent WWE from trying to do everything it can to give its NXT stars more exposure so that they become more than just–as <a href="https://www.prowrestlingsheet.com/kenny-omega-aew-real-stars-developmental/">AEW star Kenny Omega has referred to them as</a>–”developmental talent.”</p>
      <p>NXT has some of the most talented performers in the world, and at Survivor Series, they showed why with victories for Strong, Shayna Baszler, the women’s team and Lio Rush, possibly attracting a plethora of new fans as a result.</p>

        <b>Brock Lesnar Vs. Rey Mysterio Appears To Be Over</b>
      </p>

        <figcaption>What's next for Brock Lesnar following his bout with Rey Mysterio at Survivor Series:<cite>WWE.com</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Although we probably haven’t seen the last of Brock Lesnar vs. Cain Velasquez, the same likely isn’t true of of Lesnar vs. Rey Mysterio.</p>
      <p>“The Beast” was able to retain his WWE Championship after defeating Mysterio in a short but effective match at Survivor Series, and even though there are no clear future opponents lined up for Lesnar, Dominick Mysterio’s involvement in the finish wasn’t exactly done in a way that leaves the door open for this red hot rivalry to continue for the foreseeable future. Although this has been arguably the best built world title rivalry of the year in WWE and it would be a shame to see the company pull the plug on this feud so early when there’s still more of a story to tell, Lesnar won the match clean despite that interference from Dominick, which suggests a new challenger may await Lesnar–perhaps not until 2010.</p>
      <p>Mysterio has proven to be a surprisingly capable foe for Lesnar, and unless WWE has immediate plans for Mysterio to blame his son Dominick for the loss (which doesn’t seem likely), then it appears WWE will be looking elsewhere for Lesnar’s next opponent. The problem with that? There really isn’t a credible babyface opponent on Raw for Lesnar at the moment, which makes you wonder where “The Beast” might be headed next.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rhea Ripley Is WWE’s Next Big Thing</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>What a week for Rhea Ripley.</p>
      <p>On NXT, the NXT standout battled it out with Becky Lynch. On SmackDown, she pinned Charlotte Flair. At NXT TakeOver, she defeated Shayna Baszler. Then, at Survivor Series she was one of three sole survivors for Team NXT, ultimately picking up the win for the yellow brand by pinning Sasha Banks. That certainly demonstrates how highly WWE thinks of the 23-year-old star, who has the size, look, in-ring ability and charisma to be the next big star not just in the women’s division but in all of WWE.</p>
      <p>At such a young age, Ripley has already shown that she can hang with the very best of the best in WWE, and the creative team doubled down on her push at Survivor Series with a career-defining win that should propel her to even more success in the future. Of course, there is no such thing as a sure thing in pro wrestling, especially with WWE’s <a href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/2019/5/4/18528988/rumor-roundup-may-4-2019-dean-ambrose-plans-wwe-concern-wrestlemania-37-location-nxt-takeover">unwillingness to commit to pushing women as main eventers</a>, but Ripley is about the closest thing to a sure thing that there is.</p>
      <p>If she isn’t a top star on WWE’s main roster within the next few years, someone will have seriously dropped the ball.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Roman Reigns WrestleMania Push Has Begun</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Roman Reigns began his path to WrestleMania at Survivor Series.<cite>WWE/Twitter</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>You’ve all been waiting for a bigger push for Roman Reigns, and well, here it comes.</p>
      <p>“The Big Dog” emerged from the men’s 5-on-5-on-5 elimination match as the sole survivor for Team SmackDown, and in all likelihood, that big victory will lead to a substantial WrestleMania push for the former four-time Mania main eventer. Although Reigns has largely been pushed as a fringe main eventer for the past eight months, it was always inevitable that he would make his way back to the top of the card after mostly staying away from it since returning to the ring back in March.</p>
      <p>That decision has worked wonders for Reigns, who has won over more fans in his reduced role, but WWE reportedly <a href="https://wrestlingnews.co/wwe-news/wwe-has-big-wrestlemania-plans-for-roman-reigns/">still views Reigns as the face of the company</a> as he’s currently penciled in for a Universal title match at WrestleMania against Bray Wyatt. What that means is that Survivor Series–rather than serving as a launching pad for a new star–actually was a way to reignite Reign’s massive main event push in route to a potential Royal Rumble win and world title match at WrestleMania.</p>
      <p>It’ll be interesting to see how fans respond to that as Reigns has been more universally supported than ever before in 2019 but has avoided the world title picture during the frame. So, you have to wonder: How will WWE fans respond?</p>
      <p>
        <b>A Four Horsewoman Vs. Four Horsewoman Feud Is Probably On The Way</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dc1d5775e338c00066249a6/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>WWE has set the stage for a potentially epic women's division match.<cite>WWE.com</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>When the match between Shayna Baszler, Bayley and Becky Lynch was first announced, it sure seemed like more than a coincidence that three women who are part of WWE’s two separate Four Horsewomen factions were set to go at it on a “Big Four” pay-per-view.</p>
      <p>As it turns out, the match was indeed designed to lead to something bigger down the road. The bout was ultimately won by Baszler, but after Lynch attacked her following the match, seeds have now been planted for Baszler, Lynch and the remainder of WWE’s two Four Horsewomen squads to potentially do battle down the road. To go along with a <a href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2019/4/8/18301088/ronda-rousey-vs-becky-lynch-wrestlemania-36-wwe-plan-si-report">potential Lynch vs. Ronda Rousey singles match at WrestleMania 36</a> or a singles match between Lynch and Baszler, that clash between MMA’s Four Horsewomen (Baszler, Rousey, Marina Shafir and Jessamyn Duke) and WWE’s Four Horsewomen (Lynch, Bayley, Charlotte Flair and Sasha Banks)–once <a href="https://411mania.com/wrestling/wwe-reportedly-planning-horsewomen-vs-horsewomen-match-survivor-series/">reportedly in the cards for Survivor Series 2018–</a>could very well come to fruition in the near future, possibly on the grand stage of WrestleMania.</p>
      <p>Although it wasn’t made 100% clear at Survivor Series where this is all headed, Lynch’s post-match attack on Baszler sure made it seem like the story between these talented female stars is far from over and, in fact, is probably just beginning. A potential series of singles matches between the two foursomes leading to an all-out war at a major pay-per-view is a definite possibility and would likely be accepted with open arms by the WWE Universe.</p>
