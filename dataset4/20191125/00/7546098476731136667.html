      <h1>Why Xero shares hit a new 52-week high last week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:05:47+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/kennethhallau/" target="_blank">Kenneth Hall</a></address>
      <p><b>Xero Limited </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Xero+Limited/?ticker=ASX-XRO">(ASX: XRO)</a> shares continued to climb higher on Friday, with the stock closing up 2.16% at $79.59 per share. After the late week surge, the company hit yet another 52-week high to close out the week. </p>
      <p>So, what’s driving this WAAAX stock higher in 2019 and is there still time to buy?</p>
      <h3>Why Xero shares have been rocketing higher this year</h3>
      <p>Xero shares have been amongst the top performing of the ASX 200 in 2019, climbing more than 89% higher.</p>
      <p>This also makes Xero the third-best WAAAX stock of this year behind <b>Afterpay Touch Group Ltd </b>(ASX: APT) and <b>Appen Ltd </b>(ASX: APX).</p>
      <p>Afterpay and Appen have been rocketing higher in 2019 on the back of strong earnings and upgraded earnings guidance.</p>
      <p>Xero shares have been rocketing higher in the last 6 weeks or so, <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/10/18/xero-share-price-up-as-it-wins-single-biggest-client-ever/">after announcing it had signed its biggest client ever.</a></p>
      <p>Xero signed top-10 accounting firm <b>RSM Australia</b> as a client, which could provide a significant boost to its revenue in FY20.</p>
      <p>The Xero share price also rocketed to a new record high on the back of its <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/07/why-the-xero-share-price-is-going-gangbusters-today/">half-year results on 6 November</a>.</p>
      <p>Xero reported net profit of NZ$1.3 million on revenue of NZ$338.7 million for the 6 months ending 30 September.</p>
      <p>The Aussie accounting platform has over 2 million SME subscribers as its stratospheric growth continues into FY 2020.</p>
      <p>The company is still pushing into the lucrative UK market as it looks to diversify its revenue streams beyond just its Australian and New Zealand roots.</p>
      <h3>Is there still value in Xero?</h3>
      <p>While Xero shares have been rocketing higher in 2019, they may not be the best WAAAX stock on the market.</p>
      <p>Afterpay’s stellar growth run is continuing after a successful expansion into the UK and USA this year. The Afterpay share price has more than doubled, while Appen shares are up a tidy 90.63% in 2019.</p>
      <p>I personally think the Aussie tech stocks could be overvalued at the moment, but they do seem to be climbing consistently higher.</p>
