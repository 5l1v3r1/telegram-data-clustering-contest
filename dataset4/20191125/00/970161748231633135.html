      <p>Shocking new figures show the extent of domestic abuse in the UK, indicating that 574,000 working women have suffered domestic abuse in the past 12 months.</p>
      <p>A study by KPMG revealed that of these, 122,000 women have taken time off work because of it in the past year.</p>
      <p>It led to £316 million in economic output being lost by UK businesses as a result of work absences, the accounting firm calculated.</p>
      <p>They said the potential loss of earnings per woman as a result of abuse having negative impacts on career progression is estimated to be £5,800 each year.</p>
      <p>The report, commissioned by Vodafone and published on the UN Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, looked at nine countries.</p>
      <p>It highlights the damaging impact of domestic abuse on careers and businesses globally.</p>

      <p>More than one third (38%) of victims surveyed said they suffered from reduced productivity and 22% said they sometimes stopped going to work and/or would take days off.</p>

      <p>KPMG analysis of records on domestic violence and abuse victims also revealed that the length of unplanned leave averages at 10.1 days per woman.</p>
      <p>As a result of work absences related to abuse, in the nine countries covered by the survey, an estimated £1.6 billion in economic output is lost globally each year.</p>
      <p>Four million women globally have missed out on a promotion – suffering a related annual average salary loss of £2,240 per woman.</p>
      <p>This equates to approximately £10 billion in potential earnings lost each year.</p>
      <p>Helen Lamprell, from the Vodafone UK Foundation, said: ‘Domestic abuse has such a huge effect on the individual, their family and friends and a vast financial impact to both the individual and the UK economy.</p>
      <p>‘Supporting and providing resources for these vulnerable people can really be lifesaving – that is why the Vodafone Foundation is committed to providing programmes such as TecSOS and our Bright Sky app to offer 24/7 support to the thousands of people suffering with domestic violence or abuse.’</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Vodafone announced a new HR policy for victims of domestic abuse.</p>
      <p>Employees globally will now have access to support and specialist counselling, as well as up to 10 days additional paid leave in all countries.</p>
