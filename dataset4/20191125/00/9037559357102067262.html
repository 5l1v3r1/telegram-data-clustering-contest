      <p>KARACHI: The Oil and Gas Development Company (OGDCL) on Monday denied discovering any reserves of shale gas in Sindh.</p>
      <p>The company, in a press release, dismissed circulating media reports in this regard, calling them "factually incorrect".</p>
      <p>It denied making any statements on the drilling or discovery of the reserves whatsoever.</p>
      <p>The OGDCL reiterated that while it plans on drilling for shale gas in future, it has not done so yet.</p>
      <p>The company further said that its clarification comes as it is a compliance and regulatory requirement of stock exchanges in Pakistan and London to do so amid circulation of such reports.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <i><b>Correction</b>: It had earlier been reported that OGDCL has discovered new oil and gas in Sindh during exploration of shale gas and tight oil deposits in the province. The error is regretted.</i>
