      <p>Matt Thomas joined the Toronto Raptors’ list of injured players on Monday.</p>
      <p>The rookie guard fractured his left middle finger during Saturday’s 119-116 win at Atlanta. He’ll be evaluated by a specialist on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“So we should know a little bit more about the timetable,” coach Nick Nurse said.</p>
      <p>Kyle Lowry, who is out with a fractured thumb, and Serge Ibaka (ankle strain) were sidelined for the eighth consecutive game on Monday when the Raptors played host to the Philadelphia 76ers in a rematch of last season’s thrilling Eastern Conference final.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want to lose anybody else,” Nurse said. “Seems like we got quite a few guys out, but on we go. On we go.”</p>
      <p>Nurse had hoped Ibaka would be ready to play Monday, but said he likely won’t see action now until Toronto plays host to the Utah Jazz on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Lowry’s expected return date is also still unknown.</p>
      <p>Also missing Monday night were Patrick McCaw (knee), Stanley Johnson (knee) and Dewan Hernandez (thumb).</p>
