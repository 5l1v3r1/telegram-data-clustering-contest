      <p>The game of the year was a complete dud — from Green Bay’s perspective anyhow.The Packers traveled to San Francisco Sunday night for a critical game in determining supremacy in the NFC.</p>
      <p>San Francisco spent the next three hours proving it’s currently in a different weight class than Green Bay.</p>
      <p>The 49ers dominated the Packers physically, they executed better and routed the Packers, 37-8.</p>
      <p>San Francisco improved to 10-1 and maintained the No. 1 seed in the NFC. Green Bay fell to 8-3 and is now tied with Minnesota for first place in the NFC North.</p>
      <p>Here’s the good, bad and ugly from the San Francisco’s beat down of Green Bay.</p>
      <p>
        <b>THE GOOD</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>ZA’DARIUS SMITH: </b>Green Bay’s outside linebacker had 1.5 sacks, pushing his season total to 10.0. Za’Darius Smith joined Preston Smith (10.5) in reaching double digit sacks this season.</p>
      <p>The NFL didn’t begin recording sacks as an official statistic until 1982.</p>
      <p>In the time since, the Packers have had two players record double digit sacks in the same season just once. That came in 1993, when the great Reggie White notched 13.0 sacks and Bryce Paup had 11.0.</p>
      <p>After recording his first sack Sunday, Za’Darius Smith flashed a “We Love Eileen” undershirt. The message was for the mother of one of the Packers’ equipment staff members, who is battling cancer.</p>
      <p>
        <b>THE BAD</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>OFFENSIVE LINE:</b> Green Bay’s offensive line has been one of the better units in football this season. But that quintet was trampled under foot by San Francisco’s terrific defensive line.</p>
      <p>Green Bay right tackle Bryan Bulaga left the game early with a knee injury — and things only got worse from there.</p>
      <p>Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was sacked five times — although at least three of those came after Rodgers held the ball too long. Green Bay also couldn’t get its run game started.</p>
      <p>San Francisco’s defensive line — which includes four first round draft picks — won this matchup in a knockout.</p>
      <p><b>THE DEFENSE:</b> Green Bay’s defense bent — but rarely broke — over the first 10 games of the season. Green Bay ranked eighth in red zone defense after 10 weeks, allowing touchdowns on just 48.5% of opponent’s trips inside the 20-yard line.</p>
      <p>But the 49ers scored on seven of their 11 possessions Sunday — including four touchdowns. San Francisco averaged 7.5 yards per play as 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan got the best of Packers’ defensive coordinator Mike Pettine.</p>
      <p><b>JK SCOTT:</b> Green Bay’s second year punter has fallen — and he can’t get up.</p>
      <p>After seven weeks, Scott was averaging 49.2 yards per punt with a net of 44.4. Between Weeks 8-10, though, Scott averaged a pedestrian 36.3 yards per punt with a net of just 34.7.</p>
      <p>The bye week didn’t help Scott figure out what’s ailing him. Scott averaged just 37.2 per punt Sunday and put Green Bay’s defense in difficult situations multiple times after rotten kicks.</p>
      <p>Scott, a fifth round pick in 2018, is the latest problem for Green Bay’s lousy special teams.</p>
      <p><b>DECISIONS, DECISIONS:</b> Green Bay trailed, 10-0, early in the second quarter and had a fourth-and-1 on the 49ers’ 28. Packers coach Matt LaFleur bypassed the field goal and ran Aaron Jones up the middle instead.</p>
      <p>Jones was stuffed for no gain by San Francisco tackle DeForest Buckner, and Green Bay’s first legitimate scoring opportunity of the night went up in smoke. The Packers are now 0-4 on fourth down plays this season and remain the only team in the league that hasn’t converted a fourth down attempt.</p>
      <p>
        <b>THE UGLY</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>AARON RODGERS: </b>In recent seasons,<b> </b>Rodgers has fallen into awful habits where he holds the ball too long, takes too many sacks and refuses to take chances.</p>
      <p>All of those warts were back on full display against San Francisco and its brilliant collection of pass rushers.</p>
      <p>Rodgers took three first half sacks and was dumped five times in all. Rodgers needed to get the ball out of his hands quickly against the 49ers’ vicious front, but wasn’t interested in playing that way.</p>
      <p>That led to Green Bay’s offense gaining just 60 first half yards in 34 plays, a laughable average of 1.76 yards per play. Rodgers was a miserable 10-of-20 for just 41 yards in the first half, an average of 2.05 yards per attempt, which was the lowest of his career.</p>
      <p>Rodgers’ risk-averse play style was a huge reason Green Bay fell into a 23-0 halftime hole.</p>
      <p>Rodgers finished the night just 20-of-33 for 104 yards — an average of 3.2 yards per attempt, which was the lowest of his career for an entire game.</p>
      <p><b>DEFENDING TIGHT ENDS:</b> Green Bay has struggled with tight ends all year. San Francisco’s George Kittle is arguably the best tight end in football.</p>
      <p>Predictably, this was a mismatch of epic proportions.</p>
      <p>Kittle, who was returning from knee and ankle injuries, caught six passes for 129 yards, highlighted by a 61-yard, third quarter touchdown. On Kittle’s TD, he spun Packers cornerback Kevin King like a top and was wide open for an easy score.</p>
      <p>On the flip side, Packers tight end Jimmy Graham had one catch for seven yards and also had a crucial drop early in the game. The mismatch in tight end play was one of many reasons this affair was entirely lopsided.</p>
      <p><b>GREEN BAY’S START:</b> Green Bay had gone four straight games — a streak of 39 consecutive drives — without a turnover. The Packers had also scored the second-most points in the league on their opening drive of the game.</p>
      <p>But both of those trends were blown up Sunday.</p>
      <p>On the Packers’ first drive of the game, quarterback Aaron Rodgers was sacked by Fred Warner, fumbled and the 49ers’ Nick Bosa recovered and returned it to Green Bay’s 2-yard line. The Packers’ turnover was their first on an opening possession of a game since Week 17 of 2017 against Detroit.</p>
      <p>One play later, Tevin Coleman plowed in for a 2-yard touchdown giving San Francisco a 7-0 lead and the rout was on.</p>
