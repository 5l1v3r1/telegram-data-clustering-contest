      <p><b>(NEW YORK POST) –</b> An amused and slightly terrified parent recently likened an eerie image of her baby son on a digital baby monitor to “something from a low-budget horror movie” — and Twitter users have since applauded her post with thousands of likes and shares.</p>
      <p>Last week, Elise Bannister took to social media to share a “hilariously creepy” picture of her infant son Finn taken by a VTech baby monitor she recently purchased.</p>
      <p>In the video still, little Finn can be seen on his back, staring into the camera in an image that many commenters agreed made the tot appear “possessed,” according to Today.</p>
      <p>“We got a new video baby monitor and I think that was a mistake,” Bannister wrote in a post that has since gone wildly viral with over 408,000 likes and 83,000 shares as of Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Some users joked that the “demonic” youngster might need to be baptized again, while another said the stunning photo was a surefire sign the boy would start to “fly” around age 2.</p>
      <p>Others seized the moment to share spooky photos from their own children’s baby monitors, while others offered creepy stories of their experiences with the devices.</p>
      <p>Bannister, meanwhile, is taking the creepy image in stride – and good humor.</p>
      <p>“When I first started it up and saw that Finn was just silently staring at the camera like something from a low-budget horror movie I absolutely lost it laughing. It was hilariously creepy,” she told Today. “I initially took the picture to share with a group chat of friends. I had no idea it would go this far!”</p>
      <p>In related headlines, an Illinois woman was recently shocked to discover the eerie “ghost baby” she saw in her young son’s crib via a baby monitor was, in fact, a stock image of an infant on the mattress protector’s tag.</p>
