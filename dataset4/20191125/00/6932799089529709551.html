      <h1>Huawei's MatePad Pro may prove a headache for the iPad Pro 2018 in China</h1>

        <b>Huawei has unveiled the MatePad Pro today (November 25, 2019). It is a 10.8 tablet with a resolution of 2560x1600 and a punch-hole selfie camera. This new slate comes in 6GB or 8GB RAM SKUs and has LTE or Wi-Fi only options. It can be pre-ordered from today, but only in its home country.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Huawei has launched the <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/cn/tablets/matepad-pro/">MatePad Pro</a> in its native country. This tablet, in accordance with its many <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Huawei-teases-the-MatePad-Pro-in-a-new-promo-video.443865.0.html">rumors</a> and <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/A-new-Huawei-MatePad-Pro-leak-appears-to-confirm-Kirin-990-SoC.443256.0.html">leaks</a>, is a premium device with a 10.8-inch display with a 280ppi pixel density, a 16:10 aspect-ratio and bezels the OEM measures at 4.9 millimeters (mm). This screen does indeed exhibit a punch-hole selfie camera, which is 8MP in resolution. It also has a rear-facing camera module, which, despite its misleading appearance, turns out to house only 1 13MP sensor.</p>
      <p>The MatePad Pro is also <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/cn/tablets/matepad-pro/">equipped with</a> quad speakers, and is compatible with new M-Pen and keyboard cover accessories. It is the first tablet to be powered by the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Kirin-990-powered-Honor-V30-set-to-feature-Samsung-Galaxy-S10-Plus-esque-punch-hole.435719.0.html">Kirin 990</a> SoC, and comes in variants with 6 to 8GB of RAM, which have either 128, 256 or 512GB in fixed storage. However, the last of these options is not yet available for pre-order.</p>
      <p>This new slate has a <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/cn/tablets/matepad-pro/">7250mAh</a> battery, which can also sustain 15-watt (W) wireless charging, as well as 7.5W reverse wireless charging. It is <a href="https://www.droidshout.com/huawei-matepad-pro-specifications-leak-hours-launch/">said to</a> support the OEM's <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Huawei-s-new-40-watt-12000mAh-power-bank-set-for-April-11-release.415933.0.html">40W SuperCharge</a> standard; however, Huawei has <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Apple-iPhone-family-welcomes-the-new-additions-of-the-iPhone-11-iPhone-11-Pro-and-iPhone-11-Pro-Max.434702.0.html">pulled an Apple</a> and stuck each MatePad Pro with a 20W adapter in the box. Speaking of the Cupertino company, this device may yet prove a solid competitor for the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/New-iOS-12-update-appears-to-fix-known-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2018-screen-issue.415206.0.html">iPad Pro 2018</a>, particularly its <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-2018-WiFi-64-GB-Tablet-Review.357931.0.html">11-inch</a> variant. However, it will only be doing so in China for the present.</p>
      <p>The tablet <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/cn/tablets/matepad-pro/">runs EMUI</a> based on <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Huawei-P30-Pro-is-now-receiving-the-stable-Android-10-based-EMUI-10-update.442608.0.html">Android 10</a>, but lacks access to Google Mobile Services. Therefore, it may not be an attractive prospect in an international market already graced with options such as the Samsung <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S6-Tablet-Review-Top-technology-at-a-premium-price.439947.0.html">Galaxy Tab S6</a>, which may be perceived as more fully functional due to its access to the Play Store.</p>
      <p>This is somewhat of a shame, as the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Huawei-Mate-20-X-has-better-audio-than-the-iPhone-11-Pro-Max.444030.0.html">Huawei</a> MatePad Pro <a href="https://www.vmall.com/product/10086663107289.html?cid=106086">starts at</a> 3299 yuan (~US$470) for a Wi-Fi only 6/128GB SKU. This increases to 3799 yuan ($540) for its LTE counterpart. At present, these pre-order prices top out at 4499 yuan (~$639) for the LTE-enabled 8/256GB variant.</p>
