      <p>The centre label of Theo Parrish's new single bears the exciting news that an album called <i>Wuddaji</i> is on the way. It will be Theo's first since <i><a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/16208">American Intelligence</a></i> in 2014, and this single suggests he's on top form. "This Is For You" has the organic, evolving instrumentation that's been a common thread in his recent work. But it also shows off his songwriting skills, bringing a focus to his improvisational meanderings. <br/><br/>Sometimes instrumental versions of vocal house tracks can be the best, stripping the arrangement down, leaving something more immersive. In this case Maurissa Rose's warm, wistful vocals blend so effortlessly into Theo's keys that the instrumental version feels like it's missing something. As always, Theo's percussion ticks and fidgets along, rudimentary and awkward but brilliant in a way that only he can pull of reliably. It's Theo at his most harmonious and tender.</p>
