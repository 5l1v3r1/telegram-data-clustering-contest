      <p>A group, Buhari Media Organisation, has said that all those pushing for a third term in office for President Muhammadu Buhari should count him out as his decision not to be involved in such was sacrosanct, final and irreversible.</p>
      <p>In a statement signed by its Chairman, Niyi Akinsiju, on Monday, BMO said that those pushing the agenda should respect the President and stop the campaign.</p>
      <p>Akinsiju said that his organisation had believed that Buhari’s declaration would put the matter to rest finally.</p>
      <p>The statement reads, "We want to restate that President Muhammadu Buhari is an acclaimed democrat and a man of integrity.</p>
      <p>“It is important to acknowledge that Buhari’s major concern is to rebuild the dilapidated infrastructure in the country, eradicate corruption and fight insecurity, thereby bequeathing a country that works for all citizens. </p>
      <p>"As a man of integrity, he will not renege on his promise and neither will he bastardise the Nigerian constitution for personal gains, no matter the pressure.</p>
      <p>“Definitely, third term is not on the agenda of the President as it runs contrary to the oath of office he swore to.”</p>
