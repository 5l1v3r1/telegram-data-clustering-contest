      <h1>Vita Vea hauls in TD pass as Buccaneers take down Falcons 35-22</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:05:26+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:05</time> by <a rel="author">AP</a></address>
      <p><b>ATLANTA (AP) —</b> <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/vita-vea-player-stats">Vita Vea</a> worked on the play during the final day of practice. Still, when he got the call from quarterback <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/jameis-winston-player-stats">Jameis Winston</a>, it was a bit of a shock.</p>
      <p>Even more stunning was the result.</p>
      <p>Vea, a 6-foot-4, 347-pound defensive lineman, hauled in a 1-yard touchdown with his first career catch, one of three scoring passes thrown by Winston to lead the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/tampa-bay-buccaneers-team">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> past the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/atlanta-falcons-team">Atlanta Falcons</a> 35-22 on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“I scored?” Vea said, breaking into a hearty laugh. “I thought it was a dream.”</p>
      <p>Winston shook off two more interceptions to post his sixth straight 300-yard passing game, leading the Buccaneers (4-7) to just their second victory in the last seven games. <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/chris-godwin-player-stats">Chris Godwin</a> had seven catches for a career-best 184 yards, including a pair of touchdowns.</p>
      <p>Yet the scoring play everyone will remember was a little 1-yard pass in the final minute of the first half to Vea, a 6-foot-4, 347-pound defensive lineman who has been used as an extra blocker on offense, but never as an offensive weapon.</p>
      <p>Until now.</p>
      <p>“The first thing I hear out there is the pass play,” Vea said, relating how he got the call. “Jameis looked at me and was like, ‘Hurry up and get set, Vita.’ And I was like, ‘Oh, damn, here it comes.’”</p>
      <p>After lining up at fullback, Vea slipped into the flat on play-action by Winston, going completely uncovered as he gobbled up the short pass.</p>
      <p>“For some reason, I thought somebody was behind me,” said Vea, who had not scored a touchdown since he played running back in high school. “So right when I caught the ball, I kind of braced for impact. But no one was there.”</p>
      <p>Atlanta (3-8) had pulled even with Tampa Bay at the bottom of the division standings with a modest two-game winning streak. But the Falcons couldn’t keep the momentum going, dropping to 1-4 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in what has become a lost season for a team that reached the Super Bowl just three years ago.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got to score touchdowns and we didn’t do a good job of that today,” said Falcons quarterback <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/matt-ryan-player-stats">Matt Ryan</a>, who has his lowest-rated game of the season.</p>
      <p>Winston has been picked off an NFL-high 20 times but completed 18 of 28 for 313 yards. His top two receivers, Mike Evans and Godwin, both went past 1,000 yards receiving for the season.</p>
      <p>But how about that big guy who now has a single yard receiving?</p>
      <p>“I knew he was going to catch the ball no matter where it was, but it was big for team morale to get him a touchdown,” Winston said.</p>
      <p>Godwin put Tampa Bay ahead 7-3 with a 71-yard reception in the first quarter, the first TD allowed by the Falcons in more than 10 quarters. He lined up in the slot and caught the Falcons in a mismatch, beating linebacker <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/deion-jones-player-stats">Deion Jones</a>.</p>
      <p>Atlanta reclaimed the lead on <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/qadree-ollison-player-stats">Qadree Ollison</a>’s 1-yard leap into the end zone, but the Bucs took control with a dominating second quarter. Godwin reached back with one hand to make a brilliant grab for a 1-yard scoring play, and Vea’s TD stretched the margin to 19-10 at the break. It should have been more, but <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/matt-gay-2-player-stats">Matt Gay</a> yanked a couple of extra points wide left.</p>
      <p>Tampa Bay took the second-half kickoff and extended the margin, going 75 yards in nine plays capped by 4-yard touchdown run by <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/ronald-jones-ii-player-stats">Ronald Jones II</a>. The Bucs again failed to convert the extra point, this time when Gay’s attempt was blocked.</p>
      <p>The kicking woes became a moot point thanks to the Bucs’ defensive dominance. <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/devin-white-player-stats">Devin White</a> had two of his team’s six sacks, and Tampa Bay finished off the rout by knocking away the ball from Ryan on a fourth-down play in the closing minutes.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/ndamukong-suh-player-stats">Ndamukong Suh</a> scooped it up and rumbled 6 yards for a touchdown.</p>
      <p>Vea also dumped Ryan in the fourth quarter, giving him a memorable sack-TD catch double on the day.</p>
      <p>“I still don’t believe it,” Vea said. “It still seems kind of surreal to me.”</p>
      <h3>SPECIAL CLUB</h3>
      <p>Evans joined Randy Moss as the only players to begin their careers with six straight seasons of at least 1,000 yards receiving. It wasn‘t a huge day for Evans, who was limited to 50 yards on four catches. Still, it pushed him to 1,043 yards for the season and part of a select club.</p>
      <p>“He was a freak of nature,” Evans said of Moss. “He was so exciting to watch. To be in the same sentence as him is amazing.”</p>
      <h3>INJURY REPORT</h3>
      <p><b>Buccaneers:</b> LB White was able to return after being ordered off the field by the officials early in the second half after a helmet-to-helmet hit with teammate <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/andrew-adams-player-stats">Andrew Adams</a>. … DL <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/beau-allen-player-stats">Beau Allen</a> (stinger) and CB <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/sean-murphy-bunting-player-stats">Sean Murphy-Bunting</a> (knee) were injured in the second half.</p>
      <p><b>Falcons:</b> WR <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/julio-jones-player-stats">Julio Jones</a> sustained a shoulder injury in the first half but finished with five catches for 68 yards, going past Calvin Johnson for 30th place on the NFL’s career receiving list with 11,681 yards.</p>
      <h3>UP NEXT</h3>
      <p><b>Buccaneers:</b> return home to face the Jaguars next Sunday, beginning a stretch of three games in four weeks against AFC South opponents.</p>
      <p><b>Falcons:</b> short turnaround before they host first-place New Orleans on Thursday night. Atlanta will be going for its second straight upset of the Saints, having pulled off a 26-9 stunner in the first meeting between the NFC South rivals on Nov. 10.</p>
