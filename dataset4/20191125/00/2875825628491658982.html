      <p>It's not just presents, family time and food comedy fans looking forward to.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/gavin-and-stacey">Gavin &amp; Stacey's Christmas special</a> is coming too, so the 53-year-old helped the excitement build.</p>
      <p>Dressed head-to-toe in Nessa's trademark outfit, the star did the honours in the town made famous by the BBC hit show.</p>
      <p>Walking on stage, she asked the crowd: "What's occurin'?"</p>

      <p>"There are some lookers out here tonight. A few exes in the crowd there I can see!"</p>
      <p>Big cheers for the thousands watching in Wales showed Nessa and co are still very much in demand.</p>
      <p>Ruth and co-creator James Corden said earlier this year the gang are back after a nine years away.</p>
      <p>Filming has finished and the countdown is now on.</p>

      <p>In a joint statement, they said: "Over the last 10 years we've talked a lot about Gavin And Stacey - where they might be today and what their lives might look like.</p>
      <p>"And so in secret we took the plunge and wrote this one-hour special.</p>
      <p>"We've loved revisiting Barry and Essex again and bringing the characters back together has been a joy."</p>

      <p>Fans in general are chuffed - but not everyone is delgihted.</p>
      <p>They may have delighted fans by announcing Gavin and Â­Stacey will be back on our screens, but it seems not everyone is happy.</p>
      <p>Neighbours in the quiet street where the comedy is filmed have complained about crowds, bright lights keeping them up until 3am and rubbish thrown in their gardens.</p>
