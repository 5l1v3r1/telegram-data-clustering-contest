      <p>ROANOKE, Va. (AP) - A pastor in Virginia says black mold has been removed from the sanctuary of a historic church after months of repairs.</p>
      <p>WSLS-TV reports the sanctuary at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/greene-united-methodist-church/">Greene United Methodist Church</a> in Roanoke reopened Sunday. Rev. Philip Waltz says services had been held in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/greene-united-methodist-church/">church</a>’s lobby and basement since March while a $1.3 million remediation project was being done inside the sanctuary.</p>
      <p>News outlets reported the sanctuary was built in the 1890s, just a few years after Roanoke became a city. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/greene-united-methodist-church/">church</a> was last renovated in the 1970s.</p>
      <p>Waltz says minor renovations are still taking place outside the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/greene-united-methodist-church/">church</a>. He says all the construction is expected to be complete by Christmas.</p>
