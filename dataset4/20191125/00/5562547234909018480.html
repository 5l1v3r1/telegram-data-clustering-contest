      <h1>Malcolm Brogdon Returns From Back Strain</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slamonline.com/author/austinkent/" target="_blank">Austin Kent</a></address>
      <p>The Indiana Pacers will welcome star free agent addition Malcolm Brogdon to the lineup after playing without him for the majority of the past four games. The 27-year-old injured his back over a week ago, left that game after nine minutes, and has been out of action since.</p>
      <p>Brogdon’s injury put the brakes on a solid start to the 2019-20 campaign. The former Rookie of the Year has averaged 19.2 points and 8.2 assists per game and been a big part of a Pacers team that figures to compete once again in the Eastern Conference.</p>
      <p>Brogdon will not have a minute restriction in his return to action, <a href="https://twitter.com/JJFSINDIANA/status/1199095793464094720">Jeremiah Johnson of Fox Sports</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Brogdon considers himself to be back at 100% strength but, as <a href="https://www.nba.com/pacers/news/notebook-brogdon-play-against-memphis#">Mark Montieth of the Pacers’ team site</a> writes, doesn’t know exactly what caused the back strain in the first place.</p>
