        <b>MONTEGO BAY, St James — Jamaica and the United States of America on Friday signed a new Air Marshal Agreement aimed at strengthening aviation security.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The signing, which took place inside the Government VIP Lounge at Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay will allow for the continued presence of Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) aboard selected international flights between Jamaica and the United States.</p>
      <p>National Security Minister Dr Horace Chang, who signed the pact with US Ambassador to Jamaica Donald Tapia, said the amended agreement, which was first signed in 2008, will provide “a clarified mechanism through which the deployment of United States Air Marshals can be activated and operationalised”.</p>
      <p>“The current amendments will serve to strengthen the bilateral security arrangement between the Government of Jamaica and the United States of America,” stated Dr Chang.</p>
      <p>“To the citizens of Jamaica and the United States of America, this amended Air Marshal Agreement provides an additional layer of safety and security for persons travelling between our countries. It provides the added reassurance that if there is an incident on board an aircraft the Air Marshals can and will respond quickly to ensure the safety of all persons on board,” the minister explained.</p>
      <p>Ambassador Tapia, in his remarks, said that the agreement is critical for the US Federal Air Marshal programme which allows for marshals to be deployed on short notice. He also stated that the programme is a dual responsibility.</p>
      <p>“Last year, through this airport, 4.3 million visitors landed here in Jamaica. Out of that 4.3 million, 73 per cent were Americans. So, that shows how important this airport is to all of us for the safety and well-being of the Air Marshals, your people and our people. It is a dual responsibility.”</p>
      <p>Ambassador Tapia said ensuring safe air travel for American citizens is a priority of the US Government, and the Federal Air Marshal Service helps to support that mission.</p>
      <p>He thanked the Government of Jamaica, including the Jamaica Civil Aviation Authority, for its committed efforts to cooperatively fight security threats in all forms.</p>
      <p>Federal Air Marshals, commonly referred to as In-Flight Security Officers, are trained to respond and resolve any criminal activity or other emergencies on board an aircraft. The Federal Air Marshal Service executes its core mission by deploying agents on United States-registered commercial aircraft throughout the world, utilising a comprehensive concept of operations that aligns with the US Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) risk-based security strategy.</p>
      <p>The Federal Air Marshal Service is the primary law enforcement entity within the TSA which has entered into numerous agreements with countries worldwide.</p>
