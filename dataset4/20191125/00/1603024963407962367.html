      <p>Google has been working on a bunch of new features for its family of apps. The company has now introduced a new feature to its Gmail app. The Gmail app for iOS and Android now supports dynamic email, courtesy of Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP).</p>
      <p>AMP is an open-source framework that is designed to load mobile webpages quickly. Google has extended the dynamic email feature to its mobile app, which was <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/gmails-new-dynamic-email-feature-would-save-you-from-opening-multiple-tabs-4088361.html">first introduced for the web</a>.</p>
      <p>With the new feature, Gmail users will no longer have to leave the app when they tap on a link. Dynamic email allows users to perform tasks like RSVPing an event, replying to a comment, browsing through a catalog etc. right from Gmail’s inbox. </p>
      <p>“Dynamic email brings the richness and interactivity of AMP to your mobile device, allowing you to take action directly within a message. You can respond to a comment, RSVP to an event, manage subscription preferences, and more,” said Google in its <a href="https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2019/11/dynamic-mail-android-ios.html">blog post</a>.</p>
      <p>The content of Dynamic email can be kept up-to-date, which means users can open the same email and view the latest update on an order status, etc.</p>
      <p>To see Dynamic emails, the company sending the mails must support the feature. Google stated that it is working with a number of organisations like OYO Rooms, booking.com, redBus, Pinterest, etc.</p>
      <p>Dynamic email for Android and iOS will be ON by default on the Gmail app.</p>
