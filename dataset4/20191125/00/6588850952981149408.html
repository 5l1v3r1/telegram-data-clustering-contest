      <p>Meanwhile, the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) is demanding the arrest and prosecution of Yaw Osafo Maafo, the Senior Minister, over an alleged $1 million deal with UK firm, Kroll Associates.<br/><br/>At a press conference addressed by the General Secretary of the NDC, John Asiedu Nketiah, the party insists that the current controversy surrounding the Auditor-General, Daniel Domelevo, are attempts by the government "to have him removed” to prevent scrutiny of the deal.<br/><br/>The party feels the investigation of the Auditor-General is also "because of his uncompromising stance in the fight against corruption.”<br/><br/>The NDC stressed that “President Akufo-Addo must demonstrate that no one is above the laws of Ghana including Mr. Yaw Osafo Maafo.”<br/><br/>“This EOCO investigation is designed as retribution against Mr. Domelevo because he has been on the tail of Yaw Osafo Maafo over the latter’s involvement in the massive corruption scandal under which $1 million was paid to Kroll Associates, a UK company for no work done.”<br/><br/>“Rather than hounding Mr. Domelevo, we are by this press conference calling on President Akufo-Addo to immediately order the arrest and prosecution of Mr. Yaw Osafo Maafo for the breaches of the Public Procurement Act. We demand an immediate cessation of the hostile victimization of Mr. Domelevo by the Akufo-Addo government."<br/><br/>The Economic and Organized Crime Office (EOCO) is trying to investigate alleged procurement breaches in the Ghana Audit Service during the purchase of buses by the service in 2018.<br/>But Mr. Domelevo has argued that EOCO no longer had jurisdiction to investigate corruption-related offices following the establishment of the Office of the Special Prosecutor.
