        <b>A new report from market analysts Canalys has revealed incredible results for Xiaomi in the European smartphone market: The Chinese manufacturer has witnessed annual growth of 73%. In India, Xiaomi is currently the number 1 smartphone brand for overall market share, on 27.1%. This is likely to increase with the impending release of the Mi Note 10 with its 108 MP camera.</b>

      <p>There seems to be no stopping Xiaomi’s success at the moment. The company was only founded in 2010 and has made leaps and bounds in the tech industry; it even <a href="https://techvorm.com/ranked-468th-xiaomi-enters-the-fortune-global-500-list-for-2019/">features</a> in the Fortune Global 500 list. The manufacturer has its fingers in various tech-related pies, but it is doing especially well in the smartphone industry, as highlighted by recent news delivered by two independent market analysts. Its knack at combining high-end components with appealing aesthetics and compelling prices has paid dividends for Xiaomi.</p>
      <p>In a report <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/canalys-european-smartphone-market-q3-2019">published</a> by Canalys regarding the current state of the Europe smartphone market, Xiaomi has seen some impressive gains. While Samsung still sits at the top for the third quarter of 2019 in terms of overall shipments and market share, if the table (see below) was organized by annual growth then Xiaomi would be far out in front. Samsung managed 26% annual growth compared to 73% for Xiaomi. Xiaomi has also improved in overall market share, from 6.5% to 10.5% over the year. The company is currently the fourth-largest smartphone maker in Europe, with Huawei and Apple in second and third, respectively.</p>
      <p>In India, an even more <a href="https://twitter.com/manukumarjain/status/1194220026879827968">positive picture</a> has emerged for Xiaomi. IDC has reported that the Chinese manufacturer is once again the largest smartphone seller in the Indian market, with 27.1% share. Samsung is second on 18.9% and Vivo is third on 15.2%. The company shifted the highest number of smartphones in a quarter, with 12.6 million units shipped, and it is also classified as the number 1 online brand with 40% share. According to IDC’s report, four out of the top five phones in the online share category are from Xiaomi: the Redmi Note 7S, <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Xiaomi-Redmi-7A-Smartphone-Review-the-cut-price-phone.428898.0.html">Redmi 7A</a>, <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Xiaomi-Redmi-7-Smartphone-Review.419745.0.html">Redmi 7</a>, and the Redmi Note 7 Pro.</p>
      <p>It’s likely things will look even better for Xiaomi in India soon, regardless of news of <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-7S-goes-up-in-flames-but-manufacturer-attributes-it-to-customer-induced-damage.443895.0.html">exploding phones</a> or <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Fujifilm-trolls-Xiaomi-and-the-Mi-Note-10-Pro-s-108-MP-camera.443192.0.html">being trolled</a> by camera manufacturers. An executive for Xiaomi India, Manu Kumar Jain, has been clearly teasing that the Mi Note 10 is coming to the Indian market. One of his tweets <a href="https://twitter.com/manukumarjain/status/1198861068082151425">stated</a> “it’s coming #108MP” and a later <a href="https://twitter.com/manukumarjain/status/1198904150177660928">message</a> simply had dozens of pointing finger emojis at “#108MP”. He also <a href="https://twitter.com/manukumarjain/status/1198937704932634625">asked</a> his Twitter followers what would be their first picture to take with the 108 MP camera. No price or release date has been given for the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 for the Indian market, although a price of around ₹40,000 (~US$558) has been <a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/xiaomi-mi-note-10-108-megapixel-penta-camera-setup-teased-launch-india-soon/">suggested</a>.</p>
