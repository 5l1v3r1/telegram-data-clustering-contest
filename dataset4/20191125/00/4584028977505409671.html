      <p>Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane could once again face the wrath of Paris Saint-Germain sporting director Leonardo after declaring his love for Kylian Mbappe.</p>
      <p>Mbappe, 20, is consistently linked with a move away from the Ligue 1 giants, where he has starred since arriving in 2017.</p>
      <p>Zidane has long been an admirer of the France international and said last month it was Mbappe's dream to play for Los Blancos.</p>
      <p>That led to Leonardo responding: "It annoys me a little and it bothers me. This is not the time to talk about this. He still has two and a half years of contract with us. It's time to stop all this."</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of Madrid's Champions League clash with PSG on Tuesday, Zidane once again expressed his admiration for the World Cup winner.</p>
      <p>"You know that I have known him for a long time," he told a media conference. "I am already in love with him, firstly as a person, because he came to do a trial here a long time ago.</p>
      <p>"On Tuesday he comes as a rival. What matters to me is what we are going to do and we are going to prepare for it. We know the player and we must be prepared."</p>
      <p>Mbappe could line up alongside Neymar at the Santiago Bernabeu after the Brazilian superstar made his first appearance for a month in the Ligue 1 win over Lille on Friday.</p>
      <p>Zidane believes the pair will be named in Thomas Tuchel's starting XI and expects a tough test against a side he ranks among the best in the world.</p>
      <p>"Nothing changes for me because I think Neymar and Mbappe are going to play," he explained. "We are prepared in any case to play against any team.</p>
      <p>"PSG is a very good team. I think it will be a great game. Since the beginning of the season they have not had many failures; they have lost very little in the league.</p>
      <p>"I see a team that is progressing very well. They are one of the best teams in the world.</p>
      <p>"They will demand a lot from us and we know that. In the end, we're going to need a lot of things â€“ our heads, our hearts and a lot of good football. We need to work well with the ball."</p>
      <p>Madrid are five points behind PSG at the summit of Group A but will qualify for the last 16 if they overcome the French champions.</p>
