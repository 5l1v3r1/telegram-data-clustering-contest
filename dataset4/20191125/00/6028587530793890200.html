      <p>Recently, I sat in a room with dozens of the most successful women entrepreneurs in the country. Had I not known that every woman in that room had been hand-selected for her business prowess, I might have thought it was simply a group of female friends having a reunion. While a certain amount of informal chatting is to be expected, the remarkable thing about that room of high-powered female entrepreneurs was that at no point did I hear anyone come close to bragging about the amazing success of their $20M+ companies or their $100M exits. Having spent a lot of time in rooms surrounded by successful male entrepreneurs, I found the lack of self-promotion to be staggering. </p>
      <p>Coming closely on the heels of <a href="https://www.womenseday.org/">Women’s Entrepreneurship Day</a>, a new study showed that <a href="https://www.selfpromotiongap.com/">69% of women would rather minimize their successes</a> than tell people about them. This “self-promotion gap” appears to grow with age, with older women being 20% more likely to want to blend in and downplay their strengths. This means that the women who are most advanced in their careers, and likely have the most accomplishments, are the least likely to talk about them. </p>
      <p>While humility is a trait with many virtues, it is not a helpful one in the field of entrepreneurship. By definition, entrepreneurs are creating something out of nothing. Most investors, particularly at early-stages, are investing more in the founders than the idea or product. The more impressive the founder makes herself out to be, the more likely she’ll be successful in raising the money she needs to scale. Clearly this isn’t happening as it should. I’ve <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/85broads/2013/05/08/why-woman-should-brag-more/#6dde85e05644">written about this challenge before</a>, noting that women are starting companies at a rate of 1.5x times higher than the national average but male-owned businesses receive 23x more VC funding.</p>
      <p>As a female CEO of a <a href="https://www.kulikulifoods.com/moringa">moringa food startup</a>, I’ve had to consciously and continually fight against my natural instinct to downplay the many successes that my company Kuli Kuli has experienced. When someone asks me what I do for work, I often want to say “I work at a natural food startup.” Explaining that I started a company out of the Peace Corps, that I’m creating an entirely new category for the super green moringa, have raised more than $10M in investment from well-known investors like <a href="https://www.1894capital.com/en_US/home.html">Kellogg’s eighteen94 capital</a>, and now sell moringa bars, powders, and wellness shots in 11,000 stores from Whole Foods to Walmart feels exhausting. </p>
      <p>Not only does it feel tiring to explain Kuli Kuli’s many accomplishments, I also worry that whoever I’m talking to will find me arrogant. In fact, research shows the opposite. The same study on self-promotion showed that both men and women enjoy hearing women talk about their accomplishments, from achieving their goals to commanding respect in their fields.</p>
      <p>We all want to be inspired, and not just from the people onstage. Learning about other women’s successes, particularly women who are more advanced in their careers, inspires me to work harder and dream more. Downplaying your success might feel more comfortable but it is particularly detrimental in networking and mentoring conversations. </p>
      <p>I’ve started encouraging women I meet at networking events to speak about their successes. Often I’ll say things like, “It seems like you’ve had a remarkable career. I’d love to hear more about the successes you’re most proud of.” I’ve also re-framed my own relationship to self-promotion, realizing that if I don’t relay the many successes of Kuli Kuli, I’m not doing justice to the incredible team and amazing moringa farmers working so hard every day to bring our dream to life. So let’s get out there ladies, and brag a little more!</p>
