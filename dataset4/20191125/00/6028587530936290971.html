      <h1>Apple Teases Its Black Friday 2019 Offers: Here’s What Has Been Revealed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">David Phelan</a></address>
      <p>Every Black Friday for the last few years, Apple has joined the sales tumult with offers of its own. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2018/11/23/apple-black-friday-2018-event-now-live-big-value-gift-cards-with-iphone-ipad-mac-more/#31bc168b5d15">Last year</a>, it broke with tradition by increasing the length of the event from one day to four. In the last few hours, a teaser page has appeared on the Apple website – and even then, you’ve got to look hard to find it: it’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/gifts/shopping-event">here</a>. </p>

      <p>But this is not like some Black Friday ad where many of the best offers are unveiled in full detail. No, no, this is just enough, perhaps, to intrigue us, ready for the event itself on Friday.</p>
      <p>Here’s what we know.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Apple’s event runs for four days</b>
      </p>
      <p>It starts on Friday, November 29 and ends on Cyber Monday, December 2.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Likely starts at midnight</b>
      </p>
      <p>Well, if it follows last year’s pattern, it will begin at 12.01AM Pacific (12.01AM GMT in the U.K.) and run for 96 continuous hours, ending at the very last second of Cyber Monday, again that’s Pacific Standard Time and GMT in the U.S. and U.K. respectively.</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>It’s all about the gift cards</b>
      </p>
      <p>Well, I suppose there could be more surprises to follow but for the last few years, Apple’s special shopping event has worked in a very specific way: buy something and get a gift card to spend in store.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How much?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Full details will emerge nearer to Friday or indeed probably on Friday itself. What we know right now is the value of the maximum gift card. On certain purchases, you’ll get a gift card of $200 (£160 U.K.) to spend in store. That’s the same maximum value as last November, and $50 (£40 U.K.) more than the maximum from the year before. </p>

      <p>
        <i>Apple Mac</i>
      </p>
      <p>Last year, the $200 gift card came with select purchases of Mac laptops and I predict it’ll be the same this year. </p>
      <p>That doesn’t mean other purchases will attract the same gift card levels. The fact that the maximum value is the same as 2018 suggests to me that we may see similar levels of discount across the board. </p>

      <p>
        <i>Apple Watch and iPad</i>
      </p>
      <p>So, there’s probably going to be a $50 (£40 U.K.) card when you buy an Apple Watch, possibly only if you buy Series 3 rather than the latest model but we’ll see. A similar-value gift card came with select iPad and iPad mini purchases last year. </p>

        <figcaption>Apple iPad Pro - will it be in the Black Friday event?<cite>Apple</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <i>Apple iPad Pro</i>
      </p>
      <p>Customers who snagged an iPad Pro last year saw a $100 gift card come their way.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Apple iPhone</i>
      </p>
      <p>Last year, iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 purchases came with a $50 gift card. This year, I’d expect a similar value with iPhone XR purchases or just possibly with the iPhone 11 – but this is just conjecture for now: we’ll have to wait and see. Check back later in the week when I’ll nail down every offer in detail.</p>
