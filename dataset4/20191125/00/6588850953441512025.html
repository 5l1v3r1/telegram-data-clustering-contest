Same as our local chicken and the imported one. Once it’s cheap, it’s the best. It might not be the fault of the farmers when pricing. The unit cost of producing a bag of rice depends on external factors(high interest rates, taxes, fuel costs etc) which is beyond their control. We must do more to support farmers across the country.
