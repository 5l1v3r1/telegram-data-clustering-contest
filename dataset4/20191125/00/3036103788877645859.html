      <h1>iPhone 12 Pro will have 6GB RAM and 5G – Report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/bradley-prior" target="_blank">Bradley Prior</a></address>
      <p>Apple will upgrade the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max smartphones to have 6GB of RAM, according to a research note viewed by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/22/barclays-iphone-12-pro-likely-6gb-ram/"><b>MacRumors</b></a>.</p>
      <p>This research note was written by Barclays analysts who recently visited manufacturers from within Apple’s supply chain.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the premium versions of the current iPhone range – the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max – sport 4GB of RAM.</p>
      <p>This is despite rumours that circulated ahead of the iPhone 11 unveiling that it would offer 6GB of RAM.</p>
      <p>According to the report, the standard iPhone 12 will still have 4GB of RAM – which is identical to the iPhone 11.</p>
      <p>The analysts also expect both the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max to have rear-facing 3D sensing as well as mmWave support – ensuring that high-performance 5G will be supported by these devices.</p>
      <p>The iPhone 12 range is expected to be launched in September.</p>
      <h3>iPhone SE 2</h3>
      <p>The analysts also said that a modern version of the iPhone SE is set to begin production in February and be unveiled in March.</p>
      <p>The device will be significantly more affordable than the iPhone Pro range, and will reportedly look similar to the iPhone 8.</p>
      <p>It is expected to have a 4.7-inch display and a home button – much like the iPhone 8 – but will sport the latest A13 chip and 3GB of RAM.</p>
