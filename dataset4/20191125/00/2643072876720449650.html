      <p>A former member of the National Assembly that represented the Yagba Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Hon. Karimi Sunday Steve has left the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/24/kogi-frustrated-dino-melaye-will-lose-again-apc-tells-pdp/"><u><b>Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)</b></u></a>.</p>
      <p>The former lawmaker who is yet to disclose his new party, is rumoured to be considering joining the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).</p>
      <p>In a statement signed by him, Karimi Steve disclosed that his withdrawal from the PDP is with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>He said that he will hand over his membership card to his Ward exco after which he will make public his decision on his political future.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that the former lawmaker was the (Kogi) State Deputy Chairman of the PDP.</p>
      <p>He joined the PDP from the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), under which platform he won the House of Reps seat in 2011, but later returned to the PDP, from where he won a return to the National Assembly, in 2015.</p>
      <p>He aspired for election into the Senate in 2019, but was disqualified alongside others from contesting the primary by the PDP.</p>
