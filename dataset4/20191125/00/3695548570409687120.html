        <b>One-time Super GT champion Naoki Yamamoto has praised the quality of 2009 Formula 1 world champion Jenson Button's advice ahead of last weekend's 'Super GT x DTM Dream Race'.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Button and Yamamoto have shared a Kunimitsu Honda NSX in the Super GT Championship for the last two years, winning the title at their first attempt in 2018 following Button's F1 retirement.</p>
      <p>With the joint Super GT and DTM races however, only one driver competes. Button undertook the Hockenheim running alone and impressed as Super GT's best-placed finisher, notably qualifying his NSX sixth before taking ninth in the opening race.</p>
      <p>With Button competing in the Baja 1000 during the Fuji weekend, Yamamoto took over at Fuji last weekend and impressed with third and fourth-place finishes.</p>
      <p>"Jenson went to Hockenheim and he drove there and he was disappointed with their result and the car," Yamamoto explained following the first race.</p>
      <p>"But he gave me a good set-up, and information, which is great news.</p>
      <p>"It's great information so I want to say thank you very much JB!"</p>

      <p>Asked by Autosport to explain where Button's advice had helped most, Yamamoto said: "He told me that the Hankook tyres are really low grip, so take care!</p>
      <p>"It's really difficult to manage the temperature and the working range is so close and narrow. That's difficult to manage.</p>
      <p>"I focused on the management of the temperatures this weekend and until yesterday it was tough. But from qualifying, it was working well."</p>
      <p>Like all Super GT runners, Yamamoto took part in four test sessions on Thursday and Friday designed to help the drivers and teams acclimatise to the DTM's spec Hankook tyre.</p>
      <p>Several within the DTM paddock expressed surprise at how quickly the Super GT field adapted to the Hankook tyre at Fuji - especially the wet compound that has proven difficult in 2019 - and it helped Super GT largely hold an edge over the DTM at Fuji.</p>

      <p>While at Hockenheim the three Super GT teams conducted radical set-up work not seen in Super GT due to its reliance on specialised tyres, Yamamoto said a switch to a conventional set-up help unlock the Honda's potential.</p>
      <p>"At the beginning of the session, the first test day, I just went from the Hockenheim [set-up]," he said.</p>
      <p>"But on the first ride, it was not good.</p>
      <p>"We did changes to the set-up and went to the usual Japanese car set-up. After the first lap, it felt better than the first day of running."</p>
      <p>Button and Yamamoto struggled to recreate their 2018 Super GT form this season - which was Button's last as he has now left the series - blaming a <a href="https://www.autosport.com/gt/news/146999/button-failed-aero-upgrade-led-to-title-downfall">botched pre-season aerodynamic upgrade</a> which was dropped entering the season. They finished eighth without a win.</p>
