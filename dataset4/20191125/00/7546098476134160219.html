      <h1>Atlas Arteria shares on watch after $1.2 billion equity raising</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:15:32+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/kennethhallau/" target="_blank">Kenneth Hall</a></address>
      <p><b>Atlas Arteria Ltd </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-MQA/">(ASX: ALX)</a> shares are on watch now they have returned to trading following a successful $1.2 billion institutional equity raising. The Atlas share price is up 0.26% in early trade so far.</p>
      <h3>What were the terms of the equity raising?</h3>
      <p>Last Thursday, <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/21/atlas-arteria-announces-1-35-billion-equity-raising/">Atlas announced a 4 for 21 pro-rata accelerated non-renounceable entitlement offer</a> to raise $1.2 billion.</p>
      <p>The placement received strong demand from institutional investors and was oversubscribed. This is a big vote of confidence for Atlas Arteria shares, particularly given the size of the raising.</p>
      <p>The institutional component of its entitlement offer also had strong support with 95% of eligible institutional investors taking up their entitlements.</p>
      <p>The bookbuild for the sale of remaining entitlements also saw strong demand from shareholders and was oversubscribed.</p>
      <p>Atlas is still looking to raise $898 million at an offer price of $6.90 per share from its retail entitlement offer.</p>
      <h3>Why are Atlas Arteria shares on watch?</h3>
      <p>Atlas Arteria shares are worth watching now they have returned to the ASX boards following the strong show of institutional support.</p>
      <p>The funds raised are also being put towards further value additive and cash flow positive expansion of the business. Atlas announced it would acquire a further 6.14% indirect interest in <b>APRR</b> and <b>ADELAC</b>. </p>
      <p>APRR is a high quality toll road group in France, which management notes is performing well, has access to growth opportunities and is also the largest holding in Atlas’ portfolio.</p>
      <p>ADELAC is a smaller business which connects to APRR in southeast France. Combined, the 2 businesses comprise a 2,318 kilometre motorway network located in the east and south east of France.</p>
      <p>Following the acquisition, Atlas will own a 31.14% direct interest in APRR and 31.17% in ADELAC.</p>
      <p>Atlas is still waiting to clear anti-trust legislation and gain the relevant approvals in France. However, given the company’s existing large holdings in the 2 groups, there shouldn’t be too much doubt involved in the decision.</p>
      <h3>Foolish takeaway</h3>
      <p>Atlas Arteria shares will be on watch in the coming days as the company’s shares return from their trading halt.</p>
      <p>The Atlas share price is up 26.49% since the start of 2019 and could be climbing higher before December.</p>
