      <p>For years, the prospect of Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose reuniting with guitarist Slash seemed unthinkable—or, as Rose himself once put it, “Not in this lifetime.” Yet Rose’s own words later served as the tongue-in-cheek title of the band’s partial reunion tour, which reunited the frontman with Slash and original bassist Duff McKagan. After three-and-a-half years, Guns N’ Roses’ Not in This Lifetime... Tour has officially wrapped as the third-highest-grossing tour of all time. The Not in This Lifetime… Tour grossed $584.2 million, sold 5.37 million tickets and spanned six continents over the course of 158 shows, <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8544389/guns-n-roses-in-this-lifetime-tour"><i>Billboard</i></a><i> </i>reports. It clocks in below Ed Sheeran’s Divide Tour ($775 million) and U2’s 360° Tour ($736.4 million/$820 million adjusted for inflation.) The tour commenced on April 1, 2016 with an intimate warm-up gig at the 500-capacity Troubadour in Hollywood, before hitting the newly minted T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas and headlining both weekends of Coachella 2016. From there, GN’R zipped back and forth across the globe, playing arenas, stadiums and festival dates. The massive trek finally wrapped with two relatively small shows at the 4,300-capacity Colosseum at Caesars Palace on Nov. 2 and 3. </p>
      <p>Guns N’ Roses are not quite done touring yet, as they will headline Lollapalooza Argentina, Chile and Brazil at the end of March and early April. Yet the proper end of their Not in This Lifetime… Tour comes at a wise time for the band. Already, 2020 will see reunion tours and performances from Rage Against the Machine, My Chemical Romance, the Black Crowes and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2019/11/18/confirmed-mtley-cre-announce-comeback-tour-destroy-cessation-of-touring-agreement/">Mötley Crüe</a> (the latter of which will reportedly include Def Leppard and Poison), not to mention Tool’s ongoing Fear Inoculum Tour. Factor in ongoing farewell outings from Slayer, KISS and Ozzy Osbourne, and the hard rock concert marketplace is going to be incredibly saturated in 2020. </p>
      <p>It makes sense for Guns N’ Roses to wrap their Not in This Lifetime... Tour before they have to compete with a slew of newly reunited artists in a similar vein. (In particular, the Venn diagram of people who would attend a GN’R show and a Mötley Crüe/Def Leppard/Poison show is probably close to a perfect circle.) When GN’R first announced their reunion, they were the hottest band on the block. And while nearly all of their fall 2019 tour dates sold out, the venues shrunk from 50,000-capacity stadiums to 10,000-capacity arenas. Eventually, even the biggest live act will run out of steam, and Guns N’ Roses were smart to end their latest run while they could still move a considerable amount of tickets.</p>
      <p>Of course, another drawback of touring for nearly four years straight is the natural wear-and-tear of the body, particularly the voice. At 57, Rose still puts on a hell of a show, jetting across the stage for three hours every night. But at last month’s Austin City Limits performance, his voice had lost a good bit of the sandpapery rasp and belting power that it had in 2016. With proper vocal maintenance, a practice regimen and adequate rest, there’s no reason to believe Guns N’ Roses can’t continue touring for the next decade. It’s not worth jeopardizing that longevity by pushing themselves to their breaking point right now.</p>
      <p>Rose will also need his voice in prime shape if Guns N’ Roses are to record that a new album, which they have <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/guns-n-roses-new-album/">hinted at</a> in recent interviews. Given the staggering first-week sales of Tool’s <i>Fear Inoculum</i>, it stands to reason a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2019/09/13/tools-no-1-fear-inoculum-is-further-proof-that-a-new-guns-n-roses-album-would-be-huge/#31f6fb167ed5">new GN’R album </a>could be one of the year’s biggest sellers. (Which year that may be is anyone’s guess, as this band has a historic disregard for deadlines.) Hopefully, Guns N’ Roses’ break from touring will give them time to make some serious progress on a new album. That way, they’ll be able to hit the road again with a whole new batch of songs.</p>
