      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/paris-saint-germain-fc/">PSG</a> visit the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday knowing a point will be enough to sew up top spot in Group A. Thomas Tuchel's men have already sealed progression to the knockout rounds and<b> could welcome back midfielder Verratti</b> in the Spanish capital. The Italy international has been named in a 22-man group<b> after undergoing rehabilitation on a knee injury</b> suffered in the Ligue 1 win at Brest on November 9.</p>
