        <b>FORMER Prime Minister Bruce Golding yesterday joined the call of Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) officials and supporters for the party to again form the next Government with Prime Minister Andrew Holness at the helm.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former JLP leader, who entered the National Arena during the party's 76th annual general conference to fever-pitch cheering and a hearty welcome from Government Members of Parliament and special guest speaker, Prime Minister of Grenada Dr Keith Mitchell, said Holness has reinforced his confidence in him and has proven to be an outstanding leader.</p>
      <p>“For the three years and nine months that he has been prime minister he has stamped his leadership on this country, and he has ignited the hopes and dreams of the vast majority of Jamaicans, especially young people who see him as an example of what they, too, can achieve,” Golding said.</p>
      <p>He pointed out that the country has done well under Holness's leadership, and that the prime minister has “demonstrated that the country is in safe and capable hands”.</p>
      <p>Golding said the Holness-led Administration had continued, and consolidated, the stabilisation of the economy, achieved record low inflation, as well as record low unemployment levels — pointing to unemployment figures of 185,000 when Holness took office in 2016, compared to 105,000 in 2019. The former prime minister also noted the expansion in infrastructure development across the country.</p>
      <p>He stressed to the packed arena that, “in 2006, I promised you that we were about to end the 18 long years we had spent in the political wilderness, and I remember you asked me, 'How long?', I said, 'Not long'...This time I have the same confidence that I had then, that Andrew Holness is set to lead this party into the second term of government.”</p>
      <p>Golding said that as the final year of the JLP's first term in office approaches, it would not be too long before another general election is called, but he stressed that only Holness could make that call.</p>
      <p>“If it is not soon soon, it won't be long long...so get ready, go out, and mobilise every Labourite, every well-thinking Jamaican who wants to see Jamaica continue and accelerate on the road to prosperity, mobilise them to ensure that the second term is even grander than the first term,” he implored, adding, “promise me today that we are going to show the Comrades that what took place with Norman Dunn in South East St Mary and Ann Marie Vaz in East Portland was just a taste of what is to come.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, prime minister of Grenada and leader of the New National Party, in a rousing speech, described Holness as having provided the kind of leadership and guidance that the Caribbean community needs, and urged Labourites to keep him in office.</p>
      <p>He encouraged Labourites to “continue to recognise and appreciate the gem that you have in the Jamaica Labour Party and its leader...do not disappoint me, I would like to continue with the next three years as prime minister of Grenada with the vision and support of Andrew Holness.</p>
      <p>On the regional front, he said the need for solidarity is paramount, despite the political differences and nuances.</p>
      <p>“We have to view economic growth, poverty reduction challenges, and equity as essential,” he asserted.</p>
      <p>Dr Mitchell said small-island developing states are venturing into a historical period of existential challenges and threats, which are common to all.</p>
      <p>“We must demonstrate the unity at the Caribbean level to overcome the many challenges that we face at the global level. In the future, our voices must go forward in unity,” he emphasised. Jonel Powell, chairman of People's Action Movement — JLP's sister party in St Kitts and Nevis — also endorsed the JLP Government under Holness's leadership, declaring that Jamaicans are doing better than they ever have before.</p>
      <p>The conference was staged under the theme, 'Building Jamaica'.</p>
