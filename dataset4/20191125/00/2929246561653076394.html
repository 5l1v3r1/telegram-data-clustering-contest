      <p>England were bowled out for 197 in the second innings on Monday, 25 November, as Wagner picked up his seventh five-wicket haul in Tests, dismissing Jofra Archer and Stuart Broad in back-to-back deliveries.</p>
      <p>With only two wickets in hand, the visitors fought hard in the final session to delay the inevitable as Archer (30) along with Sam Curran (29*) put on a half-century partnership for the ninth wicket. However, reintroduced into the attack, Wagner broke the 59-run stand by bowling short to Archer, who top-edged the pull to fine leg. He then trapped Broad plumb in front to complete the formalities.</p>

      <p>England, who began the final day trailing by 207 runs with seven wickets in hand, had a tall ask. With that in mind, Joe Root and Joe Denly began in a slow fashion, focusing on keeping wickets in hand. The first few overs were uneventful; however, Colin de Grandhomme’s introduction changed the equation as both batsmen struggled with his lack of pace. Grandhomme finally undid Root with a sharp short ball, the extra bounce taking the England captain by surprise as he played it into the hands of Tom Latham at gully. </p>
      <p>Ben Stokes defended steadily and along with Denly ensured that the visitors completed the first session without further damage. </p>
      <p>New Zealand regrouped to attack with more purpose in the second session. Tim Southee, with the old ball, invited edges from Stokes; unfortunately for the hosts, they failed to carry. And with Stokes and Denly holding fort, it looked like England were in with a chance. However, Stokes’ dismissal in the 69th over opened the floodgates for New Zealand to run through.</p>

      <p>Chasing a wide delivery off Southee, Stokes went for a cut, but the ball kept low, took the inside edge of his bat and deflected onto the leg bail. Wagner then decimated the lower-middle order, picking up the next three wickets for 17 runs.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the match, England, who had opted to bat first, posted 353 in the first innings on the back of half-centuries from Rory Burns, Denly and Stokes. On a slow wicket, they countered New Zealand’s disciplined attack with sensible batting. They then reduced the hosts to 144/4 on the second day to gain a significant advantage.</p>
      <p>However, New Zealand’s dominance over the next three days was so complete, England failed to find an opening. Their 615/9d in their first and only innings was headlined by the record seventh-wicket partnership between Watling and Santner. Watling became the first New Zealand wicket-keeper to score a Test double ton and Santner completed his maiden Test hundred. New Zealand gained a huge lead of 262 and took firm control of the match when Santner's triple-strike left the visitors reeling on 55/3 at the end of the fourth day.</p>
