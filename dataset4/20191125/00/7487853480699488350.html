      <h1>Andy Robertson Reveals How Mohamed Salah Reacted to Being Benched Against Crystal Palace</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15416614" target="_blank">Ewan Murray</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool left-back Andy Robertson has said that Mohamed Salah was 'desperate' to play against Crystal Palace last Saturday but 'accepted' Jurgen Klopp's decision to bench him.</p>
      <p>Salah was rested in Liverpool's 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace at the weekend, despite the 27-year-old being fit enough to make the matchday squad.</p>
      <p>Having not linked up with Egypt over the international break due to the ankle injury he has been struggling with, Salah was dropped for the in-form Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.</p>

      <p>However, quoted by <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/374569-andy-robertson-fitness-clean-sheets-sadio-mane">​Liverpool's official website</a>, Robertson has spoken out about Salah's desperation to feature for the Reds, as well as his own injury issues.</p>
      <p>"It is still painful but, you know, it is something that I gave time for it to improve,” Robertson said following Saturday’s victory. “Keeping it moving will help it. Hopefully in time it will be better. I was desperate to play and the gaffer asked me if I was okay. I believed I was and luckily I got through the game."</p>
      <p>“Me and Mo were in the same position. Mo was desperate to play as well and the manager made the decision [to rest <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/mohamed-salah">​Salah</a>] and Mo was fine and accepted it."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/liverpool">​Liverpool</a> ended up maintaining their eight-point lead at the top of the table without Salah, but Robertson recognised the need to be cautious with the Egyptian.</p>
      <p>“You don’t want to miss any games but if it means him missing one game rather than six, that is a big difference," he added. "Sometimes you need to be a bit clever."</p>
      <p>The Reds needed a late goal from <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/roberto-firmino">​Roberto Firmino</a> after Wilfried Zaha cancelled out <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/sadio-mane">​Sadio Mane</a>'s opener to see off the stubborn Eagles and rescue a valuable three points.</p>
      <p>Robertson also hailed the impact of the in-form ​Mane, whose goal brought his tally to eight in the league this season.</p>

      <p>"He has been fantastic," he said. "Now every time he’s in front of goal you don’t think he’ll miss. The one he had at the start of the second half, we were surprised he didn’t score and that is the type of player he is. You expect him to score and that is a good thing and he's popped up with another crucial goal."</p>
      <p>The Reds host Napoli on Wednesday knowing a victory would see them qualify for the next round of the <a href="https://www.90min.com/categories/champions-league">​Champions League</a>, and Klopp has indicated that Salah is in line to return to the starting lineup.</p>
