      <p>Founder of the International Central Gospel Church (ICGC), Pastor Mensa Otabil has stated that successful people come under attack because their success is a threat to others.</p>
      <p>In a sermon themed “Defend your portion” delivered to his congregants, Pastor Otabil explained that unsuccessful people who feel threatened by the success of others prefer to pull them down rather than the striving to be successful themselves.</p>
      <p>“You get attacked because your success is a threat. For somebody who wishes your downfall, when you succeed, it diminishes their power. You threaten them… And people will prefer to pull everybody to their level instead of rising to a higher level. And so your success is a threat; it’s an annoyance to somebody else and that’s why they going to attack you. And fourthly, people will attack you because your success will encourage others to trust God,” he said.</p>
      <p>The renowned pastor who is also the founder and chancellor of Central University added that pioneers come under special attacks because they set a chain reaction of successful people, and so are usually viciously attacked so as to stop them in the first place.</p>
      <p>“Whenever you’re the first to start anything successful, you will come under intense attack. Whenever you’re the first in any endeavor…you come under special attacks because the adversary, Satan, would make sure he doesn’t allow you to start because when you are successful, you will infect others with your success,” he explained.</p>
      <p>Pastor Otabil oversees the ICGC churches worldwide. He is also an entrepreneur, a motivational speaker and a philanthropist.</p>

        <b>Controversy</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pastor Otabil was the board chairman of defunct Capital Bank that had its license revoked for breaching banking regulations.</p>
      <p>Founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of defunct Capital Bank, William Ato Essien, however, revealed that his father-son relationship with Pastor Mensa Otabil did not give him the chance to misconduct himself as CEO of his now collapsed bank, stressing that Pastor Otabil “disciplined” him than anyone else.</p>
      <p>Ato Essien revealed that as Board Chairman of the now collapsed Bank, Pastor Mensa Otabil was the one who pulled the brakes on many issues contrary to popular belief that he may have been less rigorous with him because of the very cordial relationship that exists between them, leading ultimately to the collapse of the bank.</p>
      <p>“If anybody pulled the brakes if anybody disciplined William Ato Essien if anybody had the influence to bring to bear it was Dr Otabil,” he remarked to Paul Adom-Otchere on Metro TV’s Good Evening Ghana show monitored by MyNewsGh.com a little over a month ago.</p>
