      <p>Adamawa State governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, has revealed that the debt burden of the state has risen to N125bn.</p>
      <p>The governor made the revelation on Monday while inaugurating 23 commissioners including Adamu Atiku, eldest son of Nigeria’ former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar.</p>
      <p>Fintiri charged the commissioners to brace up, stressing that the state was grappling with heavy debt burden.</p>
      <p>He said, “This task has been made more difficult by the heavy debt burden and liabilities inherited by this administration totalling N125,052,051,284.61.</p>
      <p>“Out of this amount, N41,836,204,499 make up the liabilities in contractors’ arrears, pension and gratuity, salary arrears and other staff claims.</p>
      <p>"N53,768,539,392.70 was the outstanding domestic loans while external debt stood at N29,447,307,392.61, out which N1.008bn is deducted monthly from state’s federal allocation.</p>
      <p>"The government has therefore been compelled to take decisive action to clear the mess which it inherited.”</p>
