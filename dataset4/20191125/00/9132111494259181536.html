      <p>The Electoral Commission (EC) has distanced itself from an on-going recruitment exercise being advertised on social media.</p>
      <p>There has been an announcement of recruitment of personnel for the electoral management body on some social media platforms including Facebook.</p>
      <p>However, the EC, in a statement signed by its Director, Public Affairs, Sylvia Annoh stated categorically that it is not advertising for recruitment as being speculated.</p>
      <p>“The general public will be duly informed through appropriate advertisement and other relevant channels whenever there is an opening at the Commission,” the statement concluded.</p>
