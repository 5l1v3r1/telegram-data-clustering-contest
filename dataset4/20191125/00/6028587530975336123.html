      <p><b>Topline:</b> Ahead of the March 3, 2020, launch of the opening episode of the <i>Final Fantasy VII Remake</i>, its director says work has begun on the next episode, <a href="https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-developers">according to a post from publisher Square Enix</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Originally announced in 2015, the long-awaited remake of the 1997 PlayStation 1 classic took a turn last summer when it was revealed that it would only encompass the first chunk of the game; the events that take part in the city of Midgar before the player ventures out into the greater world.</li>
        <li>Despite the smaller scope, Square Enix has assured fans in the past and now in this blog post that this first part and the subsequent episodes will be the length of a full game, with additional content like new boss battles and non-main characters.</li>
        <li>Around the time this news was shared with the public, it was also revealed that the development team isn’t entirely sure how many episodes it would take to tell the full <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> narrative, which takes about 40 hours to complete in its original form.</li>
        <li><a href="https://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1138890269783461890">Producer Yoshinori Kitase</a> said during E3 this year, “Due to the work already done on the first game, we anticipate development of the second game to be more efficient.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Crucial Quote: </b>Director Tetsuya Nomura in the blog post: “Opportunities for discussing our true intentions are few, but with regard to the size of the game that many are asking about—there’s no reason at all to worry. Even in this Midgar portion alone, the density and volume are so great that I had to give directions to lighten them.”</p>
      <p><b>Key Background: </b>The decision to split the remake into separate episodes has stirred some controversy among fans, <a href="https://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1176511858850897920">including around its box art</a>, which doesn’t indicate that it’s only the opening episode of the full story. Still, with the popularity and renown of the original, the hype leading up to any sort of remake announcement and then the fervor around the 2015 announcement and subsequent game-play demos, the remake will undoubtedly become a massive hit when it launches March 3, 2020.</p>
      <p><b>What We Don’t Know:</b> When we can expect the second episode of the <i>Final Fantasy VII Remake</i>—or what it will include—and how many more episodes will be necessary to complete the story after its launch.</p>
