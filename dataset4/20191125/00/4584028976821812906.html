      <p>Jamaica’s Alia Atkinson won the short course 50m and 100m breaststroke events at the London leg of the International Swimming League on the weekend.</p>
      <p>Before a crowd of close to 18,000, at the London Aquatics Centre in Olympic Park, Atkinson won the 100m in 1:03.94 seconds.</p>
      <p>The Team Iron star was comfortably ahead of the Aqua Centurions pair of Martina Carraro (1:04.11) and Arianna Castiglioni (1:04.43).</p>
      <p>It was Atkinson’s second win on the weekend as on Friday she emerged winner of the 50m breaststroke in an impressive 29.32. Imogen Clarke of Energy Standard was second in 29.44 while Carraro finished third in 29.64.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding Atkinson’s impressive performances over the weekend, Team Iron could only muster 369.5 points to finish third behind Energy Standard’s 467.5 and London Roar’s 458.5.</p>
