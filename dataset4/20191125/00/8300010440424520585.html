      <p>SAN PEDRO, Calif. (KABC) -- Six people were medically evaluated after they reported falling ill while on board a docked cruise ship at the Port of Los Angeles Sunday morning.<br/><br/>The Los Angeles Fire Department responded to the incident on the Norwegian cruise ship, which was reported shortly after 9 a.m., to examine "several persons who have been ill." Officials said the passengers were disembarked from the ship but none of them showed signs of life-threatening symptoms.<br/><br/>Four out of the six passengers who requested further medical treatment were transported to local hospitals, fire officials said.<br/><br/>"The captain...let us know what was going on and told us to be vigilant with our hand washing. There were a lot of changes in the dining area. They washed down everything before the new people sat down," said cruise ship passenger Coleen John.<br/><br/>The ship has a capacity to hold 5,600 passengers including crew members. A cause or source of the reported illness was not determined.<br/><br/>A spokesperson for Norwegian Cruise Line issued the following statement: "The safety, security and well-being of our guests and crew is our number one priority. As such, we operate at the very highest public health standards. During Norwegian Joy's Panama Canal sailing, a few guests on board experienced a stomach related illness. To mitigate any impact of this rare occurrence, we implemented stringent sanitation procedures. As always, we will continue to monitor this situation."</p>
