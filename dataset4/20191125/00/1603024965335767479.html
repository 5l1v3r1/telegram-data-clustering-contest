      <p>Sensex hit a fresh record high of 40,931.71 on November 25, surpassing its previous record high of 40,816 while Nifty50 topped 12,050 levels on a closing basis.</p>
      <p>Sensex rallied by more than 500 points while Nifty saw an uptick of nearly 160 points. The Nifty50 is now just 30 points away from all-time high while Nifty Bank is 230 points away from record highs.</p>
      <p>Let's look at the final tally on D-Street – Sensex rose 530 points to end at a fresh record closing high of 40,889 while Nifty closed 159 points higher at 12,073.</p>
      <p>Sectorally, the action was seen in the telecom, metal, realty and auto indices. In the broader markets, the Mid-cap index rose 1.1 percent while the Small-cap index rose 0.81 percent higher.</p>
      <p>Positive global cues, MSCI rejig, consistent buying by foreign investors as well as some bit of short coverings ahead of F&amp;O expiry helped Sensex to touch fresh record highs.</p>
      <p>"The prolonged trade war between the US &amp; China was weighing heavily on Indian indices. Positive Statements made by both officials last week indicating that a trade pact is likely by the end of December 2019 are being welcomed. Moreover, FIIs are preferring Emerging Markets such as India as the recent easy monetary stance of Fed &amp; ECB has improved liquidity in world markets. Whereas, India’s economy is seeing a demand revival especially in the sectors of Auto and Consumer Durables," said Sandeep Nayak, ED &amp; CEO of Centrum Broking.</p>
      <p>Nayak further added that the government providing relief to telecom companies over spectrum-related dues and impending price increase planned by players have revived interest in the telecom sector.</p>
      <p>Hopes of a trade deal between the US &amp; China fuelled a rally in metal stocks. Telecom stocks rallied led by Bharti Airtel, following reports that the company, along with Vodafone Idea, had filed applications in the Supreme Court for a review of its judgment on Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR).</p>
      <p>Consistent buying by foreign institutional investors which have poured in more than Rs 17,000 crore in Indian equity markets so far in November helped the sentiment.</p>
