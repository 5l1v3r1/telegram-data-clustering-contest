      <h1>Anthony Davis: Players in Trade Package Will ‘Try to Take Our Heads Off’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slamonline.com/author/mutoni/" target="_blank">Marcel Mutoni</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/anthony-davis">Anthony Davis</a> believes the players traded from Los Angeles to New Orleans last summer—<a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/brandon-ingram">Brandon Ingram</a>, <a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/lonzo-ball">Lonzo Ball</a> and <a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/josh-hart">Josh Hart</a>—in the blockbuster swap that brought him to Hollywood “are going to try to take our heads off just to prove a point.”</p>
      <p>“It’s hard not to think about it,” Davis said of his looming return to The Big Easy.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/lebron-james">LeBron James</a> was quick to remind AD that he torched the Cavs for 38 points in a win when he returned to Cleveland for the first time in an opposing uniform.</p>
      <p>Per <i><a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2019-11-25/lakers-anthony-davis-is-excited-about-return-to-new-orleans">The LA Times</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“I’m excited to play, just [like] I was excited to play that first game against Minnesota last year, but I think you got to embrace it,” Davis said. “I know what the reaction’s going to be. I try to look at all the guys who went and had something like that, but it’s unique, and I’m excited to go there and play for the first time with an opposing team, so it’s going to be fun.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>In his seven seasons with New Orleans, the team only went to the playoffs twice (one more time than the Lakers did during the span). The perception that the Pelicans’ ownership group, which also owns the New Orleans Saints, didn’t take its NBA team seriously didn’t help.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“It’s two-fold,” Davis said of the game Wednesday.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“I mean, it’s going to be me against the Pelicans and then the three guys, if they play, against the Lakers, so it’s going to be a great battle. Those guys are going to try to take our heads off just to prove a point, and I don’t want to say I want to take their heads off. I just want to win it.”</i>
