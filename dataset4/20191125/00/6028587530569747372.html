      <p>Bitcoin prices declined over the last 24 hours, hitting their lowest price in more than six months. The digital currency reached $6,616.24 shortly before 8:45 p.m. EST, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin">CoinDesk data</a> shows.</p>
      <p>At this point, the cryptocurrency had fallen more than 35% from its recent high of more than $10,000 in October and over 50% from its 2019 high of nearly $14,000 reached in June, additional CoinDesk figures reveal.</p>
      <p>“Bitcoin’s price remains under pressure, especially as the China-hype-driven speculative surge unraveled,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager <a href="https://www.bitbullcapital.com/">BitBull Capital</a>.</p>
      <p>“Moreover, the recent China-Binance FUD also dampened market sentiments considerably,” he added.</p>
      <p>[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]</p>
      <p>Michael Conn, founder and managing partner of financial services firm Quail Creek Ventures, also weighed in.</p>
      <p>“Though there are still rumours in the market about a Chinese crackdown on Binance’s offices in Shanghai, I think the majority of the pressure is from bears, with little support to the upside right now,” he stated.</p>
      <p>Going forward, the digital currency may be in for additional downside, according to technical analysis provided by Jon Pearlstone, publisher of the newsletter <a href="https://www.cryptopatterns.net/">CryptoPatterns</a>.</p>
      <p>“While there are a few key technical indicators that continue to show potential for upside,” “for now bears have the edge,” he stated.</p>
      <p>“The next targets would be a test of support at $6500 then $5000,” added Pearlstone.</p>
