      <p>Students from the Central University and the National Vocational Training Institute (NVTI) have been crowned winners of the maiden Knauf Build-It competition held in Accra last Friday.</p>
      <p>Referred to as B6, they shrugged off stiff opposition to beat Accra Technical University after recording 72 points to walk away with the ultimate prize.</p>
      <p>Both teams received cash, books and souvenirs from organizers while the winner would have a ceiling renovated at their schools.</p>
      <p>After three weeks of training, the students were directed to construct a studio house (a bedroom self contained house) in a limited space at the Knauf Training Center at Accra Industrial Area.</p>
      <p>The exercise was targeted at equipping the construction students with modern building techniques to improve upon the construction industry after graduating from school.</p>
      <p>Commercial Manager at Knauf, Hans Kissih commended the students highly for their efforts and advised that, they utilize the space to produce a nice edifice.</p>
      <p>“Since the inauguration of the training center about two years ago, we have trained close to 500 students with modern technologies to help them in their career after school,” he stated.</p>
      <p>He added that, they were excited young people are getting interested in building and updating their knowledge to come out with very modern and quality edifices.</p>
      <p>Head Judge for the competition, Akosua Serwaa Obeng Mensah said she was impressed with the students for putting up the building just after three days of training.</p>
      <p>The students were judged on criteria including economy of design, functionality, ventilation, internal design, timing and construction.</p>
      <p>The head judge urged participants to apply the training they acquired to improve upon structures in the country and help build a stronger industry.</p>
