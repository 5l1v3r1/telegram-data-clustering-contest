      <h1>More Than A Moustache: Movember Funds New Blood Test That Improves Cancer Treatment For Men</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Sasha Banks-Louie</a></address>
      <p>Bryce Olson was only 44 years old when he was diagnosed with Stage 4 metastatic prostate cancer in 2014. An avid surfer, father of a young daughter, and a marketing executive at Intel, Olson got his diagnosis at an age when most men haven’t even been screened for the disease.“By the time I got checked out, I had developed one of the most aggressive cancers my doctors had ever seen,” Olson says.</p>
      <p>Globally, nearly <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6497009/">1.3 million men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, resulting in an estimated 360,000 deaths</a>, typically in men in their mid-to-late 60s. While high-risk prostate cancer is often treated with surgery, radiation, or <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer/treating/hormone-therapy.html">hormone therapy drugs</a>, not all men respond to those treatments.</p>

      <p>“I went through surgery and six rounds of chemotherapy, but my cancer kept coming back,” Olson says. Although second-line hormonal drugs, such as enzalutamide and abiraterone were available, “I didn’t want to just jump to that without having data to back it up.”</p>
      <p>The data Olson needed would soon be available in the form of a new <a href="https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/22/17/4280">blood test</a>, funded in part, by <a href="https://us.movember.com/?home">Movember</a>. Movember is perhaps best known for its men’s health awareness efforts, but it has also invested upwards of $200 million to fund more than 600 projects globally to advance prostate cancer research.</p>
      <p>
        <b>More Than a Moustache</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since Movember’s founding in 2003, the Melbourne-born charity has recruited millions of participants, inviting them to <a href="https://us.movember.com/get-involved/move">take part in challenges</a> and host events with their friends, neighbors, families, and coworkers throughout the month of November. From trivia nights in New York eateries, to surfing meet-ups at Australian beaches, the idea is to have participants create their own, local events to build awareness in their communities and raise money for men’s health projects, which Movember funds year-round.</p>
      <p>While its portmanteau of the word for moustache, "mo," and "November" has been a wildly successful branding strategy, it has also created some misperceptions about Movember’s true north. </p>
      <p>“We want to be known for more than men growing moustaches in the month of November,” says Meaghan Bilinski, director of digital marketing and automation. “We want to be known for the work we’re doing to change the face of men’s health.”</p>
      <p>So far, the nongovernment organization has raised nearly $1 billion from private donations, which it uses to fund more than 1,200 medical research projects aimed at helping men win their battles against prostate cancer, testicular cancer, and mental health problems.</p>

      <p>About 95% of Movember’s revenue comes from its 5 million participants (of which 90% are men and 10% are women, mostly between the ages of 25 and 45) who fundraise on its behalf. The remaining 5% of its funds come from direct donations.</p>
      <p>But marketing to millions of members participating in hundreds of activities, living in 21 different countries, and speaking dozens of languages created big problems for Movember’s three-person email marketing team. “For every one email I’d send out, I had to create 39 different versions of it,” says email marketing manager Paige McCallum. “It could take weeks to get an email out, and that was after the copy was already written.”</p>
      <p>After years of rummaging through spreadsheets to execute each campaign, in May 2017, Movember’s marketing team upgraded to <a href="https://www.oracle.com/marketingcloud/products/marketing-automation/?source=:ex:nc:::RC_WWMK180119P00044:EloquaAutomation&amp;SC=:ex:nc:::RC_WWMK180119P00044:EloquaAutomation&amp;pcode=WWMK180119P00044">Oracle Eloqua</a>. Now, if the team wants to tailor its message for hockey fans in Canada or women in the US who’ve raised over $150, “in a few clicks, we can pull 15 to 20 different characteristics into a single email segment,” McCallum says. </p>
      <p>In its first campaign running on the Eloqua platform, McCallum’s team saw a 48% increase in funds raised from email. “Shifting our efforts from building 39 different versions of emails to focusing on segments that bring in the majority of our funds, has been the single biggest factor in getting more donations from our email marketing campaigns,” McCallum says.</p>
      <p>By the end of the 2018 campaign alone, Movember had raised more than $100 AUD million globally—nearly one-fifth was generated in the US.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Funding Clinical Research</b>
      </p>
      <p>Raising awareness and money are only two facets of Movember’s core mission. The nonprofit makes its deepest impact through investments in clinical programs that aim to improve prostate and testicular cancer outcomes and reduce suicide and mental health issues on a global scale.</p>
      <p>Together with regional cancer foundations, researchers, urologists, oncologists, pathologists, and computational biologists, “we’re working to reduce the number of men progressing from localized disease to more advanced disease, as well as investing in research that will lead to new or improved therapies to treat men with advanced stages of cancer,” says Movember’s Mark Buzza, global director of prostate cancer biomedical programs.</p>
      <p>Buzza’s team partnered with the US Prostate Cancer Foundation in 2014, to help fund a study that <a href="https://cdmrp.army.mil/pcrp/research_highlights/19andrew_armstrong_highlight.aspx">analyzed the androgen receptor variants</a> (which determine how the body responds to hormones, such as testosterone). Findings from the study concluded that men who tested positive for the androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) were less likely to respond to many of the novel hormonal drugs used to treat high-risk, advanced prostate cancer.</p>
      <p>As a result of this finding, a <a href="https://www.epicsciences.com/ar-v7-test/">new clinical trial of an AR-V7 liquid biopsy test</a> was launched in March of this year, and has since helped more than 1,600 prostate cancer patients, like Olson, determine whether hormone therapy drugs would be an effective treatment for them.</p>
      <p>“Once I got that test, and saw that I was AR-V7 negative, that gave me the confidence to pursue a second-line hormonal drug, which I wouldn’t have done otherwise,” Olson says. “I have a very aggressive prostate cancer. I cannot waste time taking drugs that aren’t going to work.”</p>
