      <p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan said Monday the conscience of his party, the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), was clean and that the Opposition was misleading the people in the foreign-funding case.</p>
      <p>Speaking to his party's spokespeople, the PTI submitted all relevant details to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), he added, noting that the leaders of two of the country's biggest political parties made money through money-laundering.</p>
      <p>The PM also reacted to the Opposition's move to call an all parties' conference (APC), saying they were doing so and protesting to mask their embarrassment. However, the people have rejected their protest, he added.</p>
      <p>The Opposition has lost the public support, PM Imran said, adding that they should now wait for four years.</p>
      <p>Earlier today, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman had called an APC in Islamabad on Tuesday to deliberate on the next course of action for the anti-government campaign by the Opposition.</p>
      <p>The conference would be hosted by the JUI-F leader and, as per sources, notices were issued to nine parties so far in order to decide a strategy against the PTI.</p>
      <p>Fazl called Pakistan People's Party (PPP) Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) General Secretary Ahsan Iqbal to discuss the political situation in the country, especially after the Azadi March.</p>
      <p>The other parties that have been invited are Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party, Awami National Party (ANP), Jamiat Ulema-i-Pakistan, and Jamiat Ahle Hadith.</p>
