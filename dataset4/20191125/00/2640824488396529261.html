      <p><b>‘then now beyond’ is being held at <a href="https://www.thehourglass.com/boutique/thematic-malmaison/">malmaison by the hour glass</a>. the hour glass</b>, whose mission is to ‘advance watch culture’, sought out <b><a href="http://www.joanntanstudio.com/">joann tan studio</a></b> to rejuvenate its 8,000 square feet space on singapore’s orchard road. the exhibition, conceptualized and project-managed by <a href="https://theartling.com/en/"><b>the artling</b></a>, aims to invite viewers to delve into a journey exploring their relationship with the past, present, and future, challenging our everyday perceptions of time and its limitlessness and boundless cycle.</p>

      <p><b>the exhibition’s commissioned artists were selected after a rigorous process presided over by a committee comprising architect <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/david-adjaye/">david adjaye</a>, international watch specialist aurel bacs, and group managing director of the hour glass michael tay.</b> <i>‘we are delighted that our passion of the past four decades can be expressed in this single exhibition then now and beyond and, grateful that our various brand partners, artists and designers involved in producing these innovative commissions believed in our project, producing some of the most exciting contemporary three dimensional reflections on the passage of time,’</i> says michael tay.</p>

      <p><b><a href="http://marc-newson.com/">marc newson’s</a> reinterpretation of a ‘water clock’ accurately measures time by controlling the flow of ‘nanoballs’ through a complex mechanism.</b> each <i>klepsydra</i> contains over 2.8 million nanoballs each measuring 0.7mm, covered with either a fine silver or fine gold coating. <b>klepsydra</b> is a uniquely crafted art piece specifically made of mouth-blown and hand-carved crystal, completed with aluminum and stainless-steel components. to complete the design, marc newson’s signature is engraved on the rear handle.</p>

        <figcaption>bronze hourglass by daniel arsham</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>the work of <a href="https://www.danielarsham.com/">daniel arsham</a> considers our place in time, from a future archeological perspective or through the use of materials such as minerals, crystals, or sand, which are associated with time.</b> the hourglass is an object that is expected to measure time through the movement of sand. presenting this object in the strong and static material of bronze freezes time, inviting the viewer to consider the present moment.</p>

        <figcaption>cubic clock by nendo</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.nendo.jp/en/">nendo</a> has designed a clock that uses two hands sliced from its solid form to convey the time.</b> twice a day, at 12 noon and 12 midnight, the two hands neatly overlap in the vertical orientation. in this position the form is united as one solid cube — giving the impression of a reset of the mind. by using the form of a cube and cutting into it, and not adding any elements, a clock is produced that shows its original appearance only twice each day.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>the piece designed by studio wieki somers symbolizes the ambiguous relationship humans have with nature.</b> <i>‘studies show substantial declines in insects populations,’</i> says the designer. <i>‘some of the insects most affected are beetles.’</i> this decline has been attributed to habitat destruction caused by intensive farming and urbanization, pesticide use, and climate change.<i> ‘as insects are at the structural and functional base of many ecosystems time is ticking,’</i> continues wieki somers.<i> ‘without action birds and larger mammals that eat insects will be directly affected by the decline.’</i></p>
