      <h1>Ford VP Calls Out Tesla for Unfair Cybertruck vs. F-150 Battle</h1>

      <h3>Apples to Oranges</h3>
      <p>In a <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/cybertruck-pull-ford-f-150-uphill">cheeky video</a> uploaded to Twitter on Sunday by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a newly-released Cybertruck can be seen pulling a tethered Ford F-150 pickup truck up a hill.</p>
      <p>But some are calling it an unfair fight. Sunny Madra, VP of Ford X, the U.S. automotive giant’s ventures incubator, challenged Musk to a head to head test.</p>
      <p>“Hey Elon Musk, send us a Cybertruck and we will do the apples to apples test for you,” Madra <a href="https://twitter.com/sundeep/status/1198988235252199424">tweeted</a> on Monday morning.</p>
      <h3>Lighter, Cheaper, Underpowered</h3>
      <p>Accompanying the tweet was a <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/384206/tesla-cybertruck-f150-tug-war/amp/">link to an article</a> by automotive site <i>Motor1 </i>that argues the tug of war wasn’t fair. The argument: judging by the video, the Ford F-150 was a $30,000 STX trim with a likely 325 horsepower 2.7 liter engine — an unfair competitor to Tesla’s beastly truck that can go for up to $69,900 for a top trim tri-motor model.</p>
      <p>“Simply put, the F-150 used in this video is noticeably lighter, cheaper, and probably significantly underpowered compared to its all-electric opponent,” reads the article. “And in tug of war competitions, it’s the engine output and weight of the vehicle that basically decide the winner.”</p>
      <h3>Pulling Trailers</h3>
      <p>And then there is the fact that the Cybertruck was allowed to pull first, increasing traction, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/ford-vp-challenges-tesla-to-a-fair-f-150-vs-cybertruck-tow-battle/"><i>Tech Crunch</i> points out</a>. To make a future competition fair, weighted trailers would be better able to establish which one performs better in a real world scenario.</p>
      <p>Musk, for his part, quickly fired back.</p>
