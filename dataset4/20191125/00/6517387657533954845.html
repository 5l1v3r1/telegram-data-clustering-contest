      <p>It's not Christmas until Mariah Carey says so; and her festive staple All I Want For Christmas Is You is set to re-enter the Official Singles Chart Top 40 this Friday (Nov. 29). </p>
      <p>The track is on course to land back in the Top 40 for a thirteenth consecutive year - that's every year since 2007. AIWFCIY appeared back in the Top 100 earlier this month, <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/25943/mariah-carey/">landing at 77 and climbing to 59</a> on last week's Official Chart. </p>
      <p>In the latest sales flash today (Nov. 25), based on sales and streams compiled by the Official Charts Company, the song is up another 20 places to Number 39. </p>
      <p>This year marks 25 years since Mariah released AIWFCIY, where it peaked at Number 2, losing out on the Official Christmas Number 1 to East 17's Stay Another Day.</p>
      <p>The song has never reached Number 1 but did peak at Number 2 again in 2017 and 2018. Could this be the year it goes all the way? Look at this year's <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/who-will-score-the-2019-christmas-number-1-the-contenders-revealed__27778/">Official Christmas Number 1 contenders</a> in full.  </p>

      <p>To celebrate its 25th birthday, Mariah has <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/mariah-carey-unwraps-deluxe-edition-of-merry-christmas-for-its-25th-anniversary__27655/">reissued her Christmas album and is releasing</a> the single on cassette CD, 7” and 12” formats. A new version of the music video featuring previously unseen footage (watch above) has also been released to help boost its streaming numbers even further.</p>
      <p>Mariah leads the way when it comes to Christmas classics re-entering the Official Singles Chart. In today's sales flash, four more festive staples appear in the Top 100: Wham's Last Christmas at 49; Pogues' Fairytale of New York at 75; Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas at 84; and Michael Buble's It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas at 97.  </p>
