      <h1>Aguero vs Abraham: Premier League Fans Decide Who They'd Rather Have in Their Team</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15111589" target="_blank">Ed Alexander</a></address>
      <p>Sergio Aguero and Tammy Abraham have both been superb in 2019/20, ​but Premier League fans have now given a definitive answer on who they'd prefer to have in their team.</p>
      <p>After netting in each of his last five matches, Jamie Vardy leads the way as the top flight's number one goalscorer with 12 strikes. Chelsea starlet Abraham is just two behind the veteran forward, whilst talismanic Manchester City forward Aguero is currently sitting on nine for the campaign.</p>
      <p>The latter pair, who faced off this past weekend, have shown tenacity, poise and a killer instinct in the early months of the season, yet we needed to know which of the duo was top dog. So, <a href="https://www.riddle.com/showcase/215998/poll">​Virgin Media</a> did the honourable thing and decided to set up a poll for supporters to have their say.</p>
      <p>Despite being one ahead of Aguero in the scoring charts, Abraham was a firm second place when the votes were counted up, with only 35% of participants choosing him over the four-time <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier League</a> champion.</p>
      <p>The result seems appropriate given <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-city">​City's</a> 2-1 triumph over the <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/chelsea">​Blues</a> on Saturday, a match in which both of these lethal frontmen failed to score. That victory keeps the Mancunians just about alive in the title race, though it's probably curtains for Chelsea.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for Frank Lampard and his cohort, the terrific form of Abraham has seen them build a healthy lead over those outside the <a href="https://www.90min.com/categories/champions-league">​Champions League</a> qualification spots, the Londoners currently seven points above <a href="http://90min.com/teams/wolverhampton">​Wolves</a> in fifth.</p>

      <p>As for Pep Guardiola, they must try to catch leaders <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/liverpool">​Liverpool</a> without their South American sensation - for a few weeks, at least. Aguero hobbled of during the win over Chelsea, depriving the Citizens of one of English football's greatest ever strikers.</p>
      <p>He remains the most efficient goalscorer to have ever played in the Premier League, with the 31-year-old building a better goals-to-minutes ratio than any other player in the competition's history.</p>
      <p>Aguero's record-breaking career on these shores goes some way to explaining how he earned the lion's share of the vote, almost two-thirds of fans agreeing he would offer more to their side than Abraham.</p>
