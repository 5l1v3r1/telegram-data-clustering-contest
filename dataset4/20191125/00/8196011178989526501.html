      <p><b>Peter Jackson</b> gets over the gain line, behind the headline</p>

      <p>Lyon never fail to leave the indelible impression that they would rather be anywhere than stuck in Europe’s foremost competition — so much so that you wouldn’t be surprised were head coach Pierre Mignoni to be replaced in the technical area by a Mr N. Farage of the UK’s Brexit party.</p>
      <p>For a club seemingly bent on rushing to the exit for a second successive season, getting there doesn’t sound fast enough, even if they are on track to be out early in the new year, at the latest.</p>
      <p>For sheer consistency, Lyon’s record in the Champions’ Cup puts them in a class of their own: played eight, lost eight, average losing margin: 17 points. Their latest failure, after a truly forgettable home tie against Leinster, will provoke a few questions from those baffled by Lyon’s domestic status.</p>
      <p>Is this not the same Lyon that has swept almost all before them in the Top 14 to lead the field five points? That have won eight matches out of nine?</p>
      <p>The team that are 15 points clear of Toulon, 16 ahead of Toulouse, and 17 above Racing, all of whom they have beaten?</p>
      <p>Indeed they are, which makes their record in Europe — one point out of 40 — all the more baffling, unless, of course, they consider it an irrelevance, a distraction from the real goal of winning the French title.</p>
      <p>That might explain a lot, not least why head coach Pierre Mignoni confronted Leinster without almost half the starting XV responsible for trouncing La Rochelle 45-17 the previous week.</p>
      <p>Those conspicuous by their absence including Fiji wing Josua Tuisova and the new wonderboy of the French game, 20-year-old centre Pierre-Louis Barassi.</p>
      <h3>Sing when they’re losing</h3>

      <p>Love for England and all things English has always been thin on the ground in Wales — all the more so when it comes to rugby, as Bonymaen demonstrated on the day of the World Cup final.</p>
      <p>A junior club in Swansea, blue-collar and proud of it, released a video showing clubhouse reaction to the immediate aftermath of England losing the World Cup final.</p>
      <p>A group of members, each resplendent in Springbok jerseys, bellowed their approval, then broke into their version of ‘Sweet Chariot’, as in: ‘You can shove the fucking chariot up your arse’.</p>
      <p>Geordan Murphy knows all about the reassuring welcome in the hillsides that is reserved for those connected with English teams on business west of the Severn.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been called some choice names by the public when I’ve come down here,” he said at Cardiff Arms Park on Saturday night. “Even though I’m not English.” A Grand Slam winner in the same city 10 years ago, Leicester’s favourite Irishman had the last laugh, a last-minute penalty giving the Tigers a Challenge Cup win over Cardiff Blues.</p>
      <p>A decade ago, the clubs met on the big stage next door in a Champions Cup semi-final which featured the first, and so far only, penalty shootout, a contest settled in the Tigers’ favour by Jordan Crane, a back-row forward who had been a goalkeeper at West Bromwich Albion.</p>
      <h3>Russell’s magic megs</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Daylight robbery</b>
      </p>
      <p>Benetton Treviso denied a draw against Northampton because none of the Scottish officials appeared to notice a forward pass by the Saints before the deliberate knock-on which cost them the game. Fly half Tomasso Allan’s plea fell on deaf ears.</p>
      <p><b>Pure magic</b> </p>
      <p>Finn Russell’s grubber against Munster, ‘nutmegging’ Rory Scannell into the bargain.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Best match</b>
