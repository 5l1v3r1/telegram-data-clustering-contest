        <b>Ghana defender Kasim Nuhu has revealed his dream to play in the English Premier League amid Newcastle United speculations ahead of the winter transfer window.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Adams has been linked with a move to Newcastle United following his superb performance for Fortuna Dusseldorf in the ongoing German Budnesliga campaign.</p>
      <p>He joined the side on a season-long loan deal from TSG Hoffenheim in the summer and has quickly established himself as a key cog of the side, scoring two goals in 9 games.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old could not hide his desire to feature in the English top-flight league after reports suggest he is been monitored by Steve Bruce's outfit.</p>
      <p>"It [Premier League] is one of the leagues I cherished a lot growing up in Ghana," Adams told Footballmadeinghana.</p>
      <p>"That time, we were always watching the Premier League. Most Ghanaians watch the Premier League more than any other league.</p>
      <p>"It will be a league that I would like to play in in future."</p>
      <p>"For Hoffenheim, I wanted to give my everything for them after Afcon because they bought me for €8 million," he added.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to give everything for them this season. But things were not how I wanted it because the coach was telling me a different story.</p>
      <p>"Going to Fortuna Dusseldorf, a certain Lutz is there, and he is taking care of everything. The club received me very well - the fans, Lutz and the coach.</p>
      <p>"The coach keeps on talking to me. This motivation from the coach and sporting director keeps me going week in and week out.</p>
      <p>"I will say going to Fortuna Dusseldorf is one of the best decisions I have made."</p>
      <p>The Ghana international has featured in eight league games for Düsseldorf, scoring one goal so far this season.</p>
