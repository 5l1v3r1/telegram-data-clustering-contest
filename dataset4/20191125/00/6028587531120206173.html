      <p>The San Francisco 49ers faced the first of what will be three consecutive tough games during the most difficult stretch in NFL history Sunday night. It came against Northern California native Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers. A game that was billed as the best on the Week 12 slate culminated in the now 10-1 49ers absolutely dominating a previously two-loss Packers squad by the score of 37-8 at Levi’s Stadium.</p>
      <p>It’s rather obvious that the 49ers are for real following this latest win. Equally as important, they have pretty much eliminated another competitor for home-field advantage. Now at 10-1 on the season, we give you the biggest takeaways from San Francisco’s dismantling of the Packers.</p>
      <h3>Statement Made Against Aaron Rodgers</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>From the onset, it was clear that Rodgers didn’t have the pass protection needed to sustain success against the NFL’s top pass defense. The former league MVP was sacked five times in a career-worst statistical showing. Prior to being removed in the blowout late in the fourth quarter, Rodgers finished the game having put up 66 net passing yards on 33 attempts.</p>
      <p>A combination of elite-level pressure from the defensive front (more on that later) and lock down performances in the secondary led to this absolutely brilliant showing against Rodgers. San Francisco yielded 81 net passing yards in the game and is on pace to give up the fewest passing yards in the NFL in nearly four decades.</p>
      <h3>Jimmy Garoppolo Continues To Improve</h3>
      <p>Largely underrated by the masses, Garoppolo entered Week 12 having put up 1,164 yards with 11 touchdowns and four interceptions for a 105.5 quarterback rating over the past quarter of the season season. That span saw him average nearly 300 passing yards per.</p>
      <p>Given the blowout nature of this game, Garoppolo did not have to pass the ball too often. In fact, he completed 14-of-20 passes in the 29-point win. Though, two of those went for huge touchdowns.</p>
      <p>The first one was hauled in for 42 yards from Deebo Samuel in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>Garoppolo then connected with George Kittle on a 61-yard touchdown in the third quarter to put this game away.</p>
      <p>Unlike Rodgers, Garoppolo handled the pressure pretty well after initial struggles. He was sacked three times and pressured on 40% of his drop backs. That’s what separates this version of Garoppolo from earlier versions. He’s doing well with pressure in his face.</p>
      <p>Now, over the course of the past five games, Garoppolo has accounted for 1,427 passing yards with 13 touchdowns and four interceptions. He’s no longer a weak link, and this has the 49ers thinking Super Bowl.</p>
      <h3>This Defensive Line Needs A Nickname</h3>
      <p>Following Sunday night’s five-sack outing of Rodgers, the 49ers have taken down quarterbacks a whopping 44 times through 11 games. This is the best mark in the NFL and has them on pace for 64 sacks on the season. Sunday night’s performance came with Pro Bowl edge rusher Dee Ford sidelined to injury, making it that much more impressive.</p>
      <p>More than anything, the career season Arik Armstead is having has been pretty darn astonishing. He recorded two sacks in the game and is now on pace for a ridiculous 15 on the season. Armstead had combined for nine sacks in his first four NFL seasons.</p>
      <p>Not going unnoticed here was the play of former sixth-round pick, defensive tackle D.J. Jones, after he missed last week’s game with a hamstring injury. Jones was quick off the snap and absolutely stuffed Green Bay’s rushing attack throughout the game, recording two tackles for loss and another two right at the line of scrimmage.</p>
      <p>None of this takes into account better-known defenders in that of Pro Bowler DeForest Buckner and Defensive Player of the Year candidate Nick Bosa. The two combined for 1.5 sacks and seven quarterback pressures.</p>
      <p>At some point, this deep and talented 49ers defensive line is going to need a nickname. We’re open for suggestions.</p>
      <h3>Pretenders No Longer</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>There was a narrative surrounding San Francisco heading into Week 12. It had not put up that signature win thus far this season. Like it or not, said narrative started to make sense after the team <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vincentfrank/2019/11/12/nfl-week-10-takeaways-from-49ers-overtime-loss-to-the-seahawks/">blew a golden opportunity</a> at home against the Seattle Seahawks on national television back in Week 10.</p>
      <p>This can now be thrown out the window. San Francisco landed early punch after early punch against a Packers team that simply did not have a defensive mechanism to stop the onslaught. Green Bay entered Week 12 as legitimate Super Bowl contenders. It now heads back to Wisconsin attempting to understand what went wrong.</p>
      <p>More than anything, the 49ers’ blowout win was impressive in that it came against a largely healthy team that had two weeks to prepare for the game. Kyle Shanahan out-coached Matt LaFleur at every turn. Garoppolo outplayed Rodgers. San Francisco’s defense dominated. The end result was a national audience understanding just how darn good these 49ers are.</p>
      <h3>Still Some Minor Issues</h3>
      <p>Despite the blowout win, there’s still some lingering issues for the 49ers. Left tackle Justin Skule struggled big time replacing Joe Staley, allowing multiple pressures and a sack before being pulled for Daniel Brunskill. San Francisco can’t get Staley back soon enough, especially with the struggles we’re seeing from right tackle Mike McGlinchey.</p>
      <p>Depth at receiver remains a problem. Marquise Goodwin was a healthy scratch Sunday night for the second time this season. Dante Pettis did not play a single snap after seeing action for two snaps on offense last week. Emmanuel Sanders (ribs) was nowhere to be found with just one catch.</p>
      <p>San Francisco can overcome these depth issues primarily because of its top-end rushing attack, George Kittle and Shanahan’s play calling on offense. It could end up being an issue down the road.</p>
      <p>We’re also a bit concerned over aggressive penalties on defense. Multiple Packers drives were kept alive by some dumb penalties on that side of the ball. San Francisco will take it with the domination we saw on that side of the ball. It’s just something to keep an eye on moving forward.</p>
      <h3>Other Notes</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vincentfrank/2019/11/21/george-kittle-returns-to-practice-and-other-49ers-notes-ahead-of-packers-game/">Returning from a two-game absence</a> (ankle, knee), George Kittle was back to his dominant self. He caught all six of the targets thrown in his direction for 129 yards, averaging north of 20 yards per target. Shanahan indicated after the game that Kittle is dealing with bone chips in his ankle. The gamer he is, Kittle will continue to play through this injury.</p>
      <p>San Francisco only had to run 45 plays on offense in the 29-point win Sunday night. What stood out the most is how much success they had on these plays. The combination of Raheem Mostert and Tevin Coleman went for 84 yards and two touchdowns on 17 attempts. That was key with Matt Breida (ankle) sidelined for a second consecutive game.</p>
      <p>The domination was prevalent Sunday night based on this one basic stat. The 49ers averaged a robust 7.5 yards per play compared to 2.8 yards per play for Green Bay. The Packers averaged less than two yards per pass play.</p>
      <p>We were intrigued heading into the game to see how the cornerback position would play out opposite Richard Sherman. It was noted this past week that Ahkello Witherspoon would get his first start since suffering an injury back in Week 3. He split time with Emmanuel Mosley. The results were resounding for San Francisco’s secondary, as the team allowed Green Bay receivers to catch 12-of-22 passes for just 66 yards. That’s 3.0 yards per target.</p>

      <p>Often-injured free safety Jimmie Ward might have had the best game of his career. The sixth-year player recorded six tackles and three passes defended in the game. He broke up multiple first downs and found himself dominating both in coverage and in the box. If Ward continues to play like this, the 49ers’ defense is simply going to be unbeatable moving forward.</p>
      <p>San Francisco has now outscored its opponents by a combined 169 points, It’s the franchise’s largest point differential through 11 games since 1948, their third year of existence.</p>
      <p>The 49ers will be watching “Monday Night Football” between the Los Angeles Rams and Baltimore Ravens with a keen eye. With a loss, Los Angeles will fall four games behind San Francisco with five games remaining.</p>
