          <h3>Canopy receives licence for bottling facility</h3>
          <p>Canopy Growth Corp. has secured a licence for its bottling facility in Smith Falls, Ont., which will begin producing cannabis beverages immediately, the company said on Monday.</p>
          <p>Canopy, in partnership with Constellation Brands, has bet heavily on cannabis beverages, and plans to launch 11 drink products “during the first wave of production, with more added throughout the year.”</p>
          <p>“This licence positions the Company to begin shipping beverage inventory to the provinces within weeks. Timing of specific product availability will vary by province,” the company said.</p>
          <p>On the Canopy’s Nov. 14 earnings call, CFO Mike Lee said the company was “waiting to see whether there are delays over Christmas or how that happens.”</p>
          <p>Canopy CEO Mark Zekulin said on the call that “the beverages will range from spirit alternative products to ready-to-drink Tweed-branded beverages to refreshing sparkling waters and citrus-flavored beverages.”</p>
          <p>Canopy’s President Rade Kovacevic added that beverage product pricing would be roughly in line with alcoholic beverages.</p>
          <p>“Our strategy, as everyone knows, from day one has been to disrupt beverage alcohol. And so pricing our beverage products at a slight premium to beverage alcohol is important if it’s going to be a direct trade-off,” Mr. Kovacevic said.</p>

            <h3>Organigram sales decline, company delays facility completion</h3>
            <p>Organigram is delaying the completion of the final phase of its Moncton campus, after a disappointing fourth quarter where sales declined 34 per cent compared to the preceding quarter.</p>
            <p>Organigram’s sharp drop in quarterly revenue – $16.3-million in Q4, down from $24.8-million in Q3– is in line with company guidance released earlier in the month. The company said it sold $20-million worth of product, but took a $3.7-million “provision for product returns and pricing adjustments.”</p>
            <p>“The majority of the provision was largely related to two slower selling stock-keeping units (SKUs) sold to the Ontario Cannabis Store (OCS), comprised of a bespoke order of lower THC dried flower intended to fulfill a supply gap in the market earlier this year and THC oils which have seen less than anticipated demand in the adult-use recreational market,” the company said.</p>
            <p>Organigram also took a $1.6-million writedown on inventory. It reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $7.9-million.</p>
            <p>“The lack of a sufficient retail network and slower than expected store openings in Ontario continued to impact revenue growth in Q4 2019 and were further exacerbated by increased industry supply. Quarter to quarter revenue is expected to continue to be volatile due to the timing of large pipeline orders for Ontario, in particular, where there is a centralized distribution model and where store additions are difficult to forecast.,” the company said.</p>
            <p>The company said it is delaying the completion of phase 4C of its Moncton facility, which is 70 per cent done, “until there is more clarity on the timing and magnitude of the retail network expansion.”</p>

              <h3>Khiron gets approval for high-THC cultivation in Colombia</h3>
              <p>Khiron Life Sciences Corp. has been allocated a quota from the Colombian government to cultivate up to 560 kilograms of high-THC cannabis, which will be transformed into extract products. This makes the Canadian-based, Colombian-focused cannabis producer the first company to get approval to commercialize psychoactive cannabis for both domestic and export purposes, Khiron said on Monday. The company has also been authorized to ship high-THC extract to Brazil and Uruguay.</p>

                  <h3>Aphria files $500-million shelf prospectus</h3>
                  <p>Aphria Inc. filed a shelf prospectus on Friday giving it the ability to raise up to $500-million over the next 25 months by issuing, shares, warrants, debt or convertible debt.</p>
                  <p>"The Securities may be offered in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined based on market conditions at the time of sale and set forth in one or more accompanying prospectus supplements,” the prospectus says.</p>
                  <p>That includes the possibility of at-the-market transactions, where securities are offered based on current market price. As with any shelf prospectus, the filing does not guarantee Aphria will raise money, but it does give the company the flexibility to raise new capital if needed or issue new securities as part of an acquisition.</p>

                    <h3>Aurora’s March debentures to convert at $3.28</h3>
                    <p>Aurora Cannabis Inc. will issue 69-million common shares to debenture holders who have elected to convert $227-million worth of convertible debentures, the company said Monday. The conversion removes a significant liability that was supposed to come due in March 2020, but does so with significantly higher dilution to existing shareholders than was anticipated. The conversion price for the March debentures has been pegged at $3.28, down from a conversion price of $13.05 when the debentures were issued.</p>
