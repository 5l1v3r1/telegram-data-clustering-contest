      <p>Today’s employees want to work for organizations that care. But even more than that, we want  to align our goals – making the world a better place along with the mission of the organizations we work for and support. </p>
      <p>With this level of alignment, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a business imperative delivering measurable results for people and the organizations in which they are employed.</p>
      <p>But let’s take a look at the numbers. Recent<a href="https://www.charities.org/charitable-giving-trends"> research</a> reveals that an estimated 71% of workers surveyed believe it’s critical to work where the office culture supports volunteering and giving back. Another study supports this same notion: employees prefer when companies incorporate involvement in the community into the workday, states a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/citizenship-deloitte-volunteer-impact-research.html">2017 Deloitte Volunteerism Survey</a>.</p>
      <p>There’s no denying that integration into the community lifts employee morale and helps establish a positive, healthy working environment. What I want to instill in others is being part of a mission-driven organization that can help them reach their full potential as a whole person, connected to both impact and a results-oriented organization.</p>
      <p>Personally, I’ve been making volunteerism a priority throughout my entire career – it’s an emotional experience and inspires me to get up every day. Giving back without having to quit my day job. It also allows me to see firsthand the way my support and assistance helps the neediest of causes and people in my community. This emotional tie leads to less tension and increases positivity while I’m “on the clock.”</p>
      <p>Recently, I have been volunteering at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/new-york-academy-of-sciences/">The New York Academy of Sciences</a> as the executive sponsor for my company Medidata,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/new-york-academy-of-sciences/"> a </a>Dassault Systèmes<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/new-york-academy-of-sciences/"> company. I support and admire their impact, particularly the way they </a>accepted the STEM challenge, closing the skills gap and partnering with industry leaders and international organizations like UNICEF to ensure we can support them. Twenty-first-century jobs in all industries require STEM skills at an unprecedented level. To meet this demand, the Academy and its partners are expanding STEM education resources to address the needs of underserved populations around the world​. </p>
      <p>I am also on the Board of Directors for Alleria Research Corporation, a nonprofit organization focused on measuring the impact of diversity and inclusion (D&amp;I). As we work towards a more equitable and inclusive world, we must measure impact to deliver results. It’s not enough to simply invest in a D&amp;I strategy – organizations must leverage science and technology to impact the way people think about D&amp;I, and, most importantly, what they do about it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cultivating A Sense of Purpose: Volunteering On The Clock</b>
      </p>
      <p>When you incorporate a combination of volunteer work, skills giving and other types of workplace giving programs strategically within your organization’s business goals and values, it gives your team members a sense of purpose. It also makes them feel better connected to the community and your company-wide social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. But even more importantly, it delivers measurable business outcomes. It’s a win-win for everyone.</p>
      <p>Volunteering and giving back is rewarding – and it excites us as human beings to work next to others that have the same vision, values and passion for making the world a better place.</p>
      <p>A<a href="http://fortune.com/2017/02/09/the-best-employers-giving-back-philanthropy-volunteering/"> recent Fortune article</a> stated that many leading employers are discovering strategies to use charitable efforts to better connect teams to their daily professional tasks and ultimately drive a more productive, engaged workforce.</p>
      <p>Many organizations, from small local businesses to large <i>Fortune</i> 500 companies, are increasingly encouraging employees to volunteer, leading to enhanced company morale and personal satisfaction and also boosting the company’s bottom line. Many workers who volunteer through work admit feeling better about their employer and say it strengthens bonds with their colleagues.</p>
      <p>Management’s support of volunteering can range from simple strategies like offering information and resources for volunteer activities, to providing paid time off for workers that volunteer their skills to assist in the community. In fact, many companies today encourage employees to volunteer and allow them to take time off during the workday without loss of pay.  </p>
      <p>People want to be a part of an organization that gives back. When they work for a company that values their community and their people on the same level as the company’s financial success, you often gain the benefit of long-term loyalty and dedication.</p>
      <p>Here are several other benefits:</p>
      <p><b>• It builds people skills. </b>When you interact with your employees outside of the traditional office walls, you experience them in a new way. Furthermore, volunteering aligns people around a common community cause. For example, whether you’re donating time at a homeless shelter, participating in a cancer walk or helping build housing for those in need, teaming up together with colleagues in a fresh, new environment helps develop vital people skills and bonds at work.</p>
      <p><b>• It inspires worker passion</b>. We all have a passion. Whether it’s animals, children, sports, religion or anything else, giving employees the chance to dig into that passion while on the clock in a philanthropic way transforms passion into engagement. And, when you allow workers to get involved in their passion as a volunteer opportunity on the job, they’re twice as engaged.</p>
      <p><b>• It boosts employee engagement. </b>There are many ways to boost engagement via volunteerism and giving back, including collection drives for food and clothing, as well as fundraisers, among many others. HR departments can play a significant role in promoting community involvement and encouraging participation. One way is to develop a team of employee ambassadors. Acting as an ambassador gives team members a sense of responsibility and a hands-on role in supporting your organization’s good work – which can be incredibly powerful. Consider this eye-opening statistic from a<a href="https://www.benevity.com/press-releases/study-links-corporate-goodness-to-retention"> 2019 Benevity Engagement Study</a>: Turnover dropped by 57% in employee teams “most deeply connected to their companies’ giving and volunteering efforts.”</p>
      <p>While fostering an environment where employees are excited about making a difference is an exciting prospect, it’s critical to understand the importance of measuring your progress along the way.</p>
      <p>If your goal is participation, for example, that is a crucial metric for success, along with anecdotal and qualitative evidence for the impact that participation has on your workers’ views and overall happiness. Surveys can be a helpful way to gather this feedback.</p>
      <p>Also, consider creating an outline of your volunteer program from the start to measure its performance over time. This is an important step that many busy executives often miss; however, it’s critical to think through your agenda from the start. With this approach, you can easily generate CSR reports, which are key for transparency for employees and other stakeholders. It also allows you to evolve (and course-correct) your program throughout the year.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind, because change happens, the volunteer program you develop now may not be the exact mirror of the one your organization needs down the road. But without this strategy in place, there’s no record of your evolution or a way to track progress and successes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Foster A Culture of Volunteering – It’s Contagious</b>
      </p>
      <p>There’s no question helping others can be contagious. If you support a local organization or offer your skills to another in need, it can cause a chain reaction of philanthropic acts throughout your workplace and across your community. This means that your co-workers, friends and family might also experience an emotional and energetic boost.</p>
      <p>Remember, volunteering and giving do not have to be all-consuming. We can do it during work, after work or over the weekend; we can share it with our children and our community; and, we can find ourselves traveling around the world, meeting and engaging with new and interesting people we may never have otherwise met.</p>
      <p>People often stop me to ask why I'm always happy and smiling and walking around with what seems like endless energy. My answer: By volunteering, I'm part of an amazing tribe of people that are all agents of change. Volunteering your time, energy or money to help others doesn’t just make the world a better place—it also makes us all better people.</p>
