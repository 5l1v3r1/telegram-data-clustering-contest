      <h1>Amazon Black Friday Smart Home And Security Camera Deals 2019 Updated Best Buy</h1>

      <p>Home security is a big business and a big deal to consumers. It is an industry on track to surpass $9.7 Billion in about four more years. People want to protect their homes and families, but they do not want to go broke trying to do so. To get right to the point, that billion-dollar growth means better technology and sweeter savings for you as you seek to monitor and secure your home and office, especially as we enter Black Friday specials.Here are several deals at Amazon and Best Buy that will allow you to build your own system and save a bunch of money on long-term contracts.</p>
      <p>Arlo is one of the top independent contenders in this space (they spun off from parent company, NetGear, earlier this year). I have used some of their gear for a family member’s house and it impressed me. Solid, excellent quality, and pretty easy to use. These three deals, one from Best Buy and two from Amazon, will likely get updated as we get closer to Black Friday, so check back in if you are still shopping. </p>
      <p>Best Buy: Arlo - Pro 2 4-Camera Indoor/Outdoor Wireless 1080p Security Camera System</p>

      <h4>Ring Smart Doorbell</h4>
      <p>Ring made their entry as a smart doorbell. Then Amazon acquired them (I guess that makes them even smarter, for selling to Amazon). So, you can see how the smart home is expanding under Amazon’s watchful eye (pun intended) and with how they are integrating it with the Amazon Echo devices (voice and screens). </p>
      <p>If you want to try it out without breaking the bank, get this Certified Refurbished Ring Wi-Fi Enabled Video Doorbell in Satin Nickel, Works with Alexa.</p>

      <h4>SimpliSafe Home Security Systems</h4>
      <p>You can order SimpliSafe at Amazon, but at press time, the best Black Friday deal for a home security cam from them is a direct offer on their site. That deal may also happen at Amazon, but for now, follow the links below to get there.</p>

      <h3>SimpliSafe Essentials Security System for $130 (Save $129)</h3>

      </p>
      <p>SimpliSafe is offering a 50 percent off Black Friday deal on many of their most popular packages. Check out the Essentials bundle that gets you started for $130 (for the gear). </p>
      <p>If you have not heard about SimpliSafe, it is a low cost, do-it-yourself home security system that you can also register it (in many municipalities) with the local police department much like the bigger companies do when you install their system. It is easy to set up - plug in the base station and go through a few prompts and you can have a home security system going in no time at all. It is $14.99 per month for monitoring, on a month-to-month basis, no long-term contracts, but you do not have to opt for that to have a working system.</p>
