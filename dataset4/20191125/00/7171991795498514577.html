      <h1>ATX2AT Makes Retrocomputing Safer, Heads To Kickstarter</h1>

      <p>It’s easy to take power supplies for granted in modern computing, but powering vintage hardware is not always so simple or worry-free. The power supplies for old electronics are themselves vintage, and the hardware being powered can be quite precious. A power problem can easily cause fried components and burned traces on a board. As [Doc TB] observes, by the time you hear crackling, it’s already far too late.</p>

      <p>To address this, [Doc TB] designed the <a href="https://x86.fr/atx2at-smart-converter/">ATX2AT Smart Converter</a> as an open source project and recently decided to <a href="https://x86.fr/atx2at-smart-converter-live-kickstarter/">make it available through a Kickstarter campaign</a>. ATX2AT is a way to safely and securely replace some vintage power supplies with a standard PC ATX power supply, and adds a large number of protection features such as current monitoring and programmable reaction time for overcurrent protection. All of this can help prevent a retrocomputer enthusiast’s precious vintage hardware from being damaged in the event of a problem. It’s not just for powering known-good hardware; it can be invaluable when testing or repairing hardware that might be in an unknown state.</p>
      <p>When <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/05/24/a-smarter-psu-converter-leaves-the-magic-smoke-inside/">we first came across [Doc TB]’s ATX2AT project</a> we recognized it as a well-made device to address a specific niche, and to do it well. Assessing risk takes into account not only the probability of a problem occurring, but also just how bad things would be if it <i>did</i> happen. If your old hardware is precious enough to warrant the extra protection, or you are into repairing or assessing old hardware, then an ATX2AT might be just what you need. You can see it in action in the video embedded below.</p>
