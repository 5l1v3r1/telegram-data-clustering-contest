      <p>Lewis Capaldi could top off an incredible 2019 by claiming his third Number 1 on the Official Irish Singles Chart.</p>
      <p>Tallying downloads and streams from across the weekend, the Scotsman's latest track Before You Go is at Number 1 on today's chart update, some 900 units ahead the closest competition at the halfway point of the week.</p>
      <p>Before You Go <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/billie-eilish-scores-her-first-number-1-on-the-official-irish-singles-chart-with-everything-i-wanted__27791/">debuted at Number 11 on last Friday's chart</a> after less than three days on sale. Earlier in 2019, Someone You Loved spent <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/irish-singles-chart/20190405/ie7501/">six weeks leading the Top 50</a>, plus Hold Me While You Wait <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/hold-me-while-you-wait-becomes-lewis-capaldis-second-irish-number-1-single-i-could-kiss-you-all-passionately-on-the-mouth-__26283/">spent one week at the top in May</a>, making Ireland the only country that the song peaked at Number 1.</p>
