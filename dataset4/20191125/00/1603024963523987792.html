      <p>Appeared to be giving some clarity on Amaravati's fate as state capital for the first time since assuming power in May, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy onÂ November 25 asked the APCRDA to go ahead with the development works and complete them on a priority basis.</p>
      <p>All works related to the capital city development were brought to a halt on May 30 following a government order, putting a question mark on whether or not Amaravati would remain the state's new capital.</p>
      <p>Jagan Reddy conducted a high-level review meeting on the capital here on Monday and directed that constructions that neared completion in Amaravati region be taken up first.</p>
      <p>The government is ready to grant funds. Complete the works as quickly as possible on a priority basis, a late night release from the Chief Minister's Office said, quoting Jagan.</p>
      <p>The Chief Minister, according to the release, asked the officials to keep the states financial position in mind and avoid unnecessary expenditure while going ahead with the works.</p>
      <p>He suggested that reverse tendering could bring down the costs and lessen the burden on the exchequer.</p>
      <p>Enquiring about the designs of arterial roads in the capital, the Chief Minister asked the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA) officials to ensure nothing was amiss in planning.</p>
      <p>Take expert advise from professors of IITs and other prestigious institutions on designs and costs.</p>
      <p>Take up landscaping along the road margins and ensure the expenditure is minimized in development of basic infrastructure, he added.</p>
      <p>The release said the government decided to develop infrastructure in the returnable plots allotted to farmers, who parted with their lands for the capital.</p>
      <p>Municipal Minister Botsa Satyanarayana, Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney, CRDA Commissioner Lakshmi Narasimham and other officials attended.</p>
