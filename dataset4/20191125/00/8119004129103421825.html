      <p>Chief Information Officer Surath Kumar Sarker sent a letter to the Bangla newspaper on Sunday seeking its explanation of a report titled “Babri Mosque Case Verdict: Modi Congratulates 5 Judges” on Nov 13.</p>
      <p>The High Commission of India in Dhaka protested against the “false and baseless” news, and the Manab Zamin published a rejoinder as well, the letter noted.</p>
      <p>“Publication of such false and baseless news appears to carry evil intentions,” the information ministry said.</p>
      <p>“Moreover, the government believes the baseless and false news was published with the ulterior motive to destroy the communal harmony in Bangladesh,” it added.</p>
