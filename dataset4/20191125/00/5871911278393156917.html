      <h1>Dak Prescott snubs head coach Jason Garrett on high-five (Video)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:16:18+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/tsd-staff/" target="_blank">TSD Staff</a></address>
      <p>The Cowboys still sit atop the NFC East standings, but the team clearly isn’t playing its best football yet, and it does appear that not everyone is on the same page.</p>
      <p>There’s been some interesting body language by players and coaches during games, and Sunday’s showdown with the Patriots in Foxboro produced more of the same.</p>
      <p>Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott was disappointed with the offense after a drive ended without points in the first quarter, but head coach Jason Garrett tried to lift his spirits with a high-five. Prescott, however, just ran right by his head coach — leaving the poor guy hanging.</p>

      <p>It’s actually not the first time we’ve seen this during a Cowboys game, either. A number of <a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2019/10/13/cowboys-snub-jason-garrett-on-high-five-attempts-video/">Cowboys players snubbed Garrett</a> on the sideline during the team’s loss to the Jets in Week 6 (which <a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2019/10/13/cowboys-snub-jason-garrett-on-high-five-attempts-video/">you can watch here</a>).</p>
