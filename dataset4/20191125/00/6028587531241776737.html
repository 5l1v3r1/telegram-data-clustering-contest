      <p>Recently <a href="https://www.sustaineurope.com/2019-global-destination-sustainability-index-and-awards-released-20191030.html">named the world’s most sustainable city for the fourth year in a row</a>, Gothenburg is a hub for sustainable design, infrastructure, and of course food and drink. It rains, on average, every third day in this hip city, but rather than put a damper on plans there are plenty of indoor activities (like exploring <a href="https://goteborgskonstmuseum.se/en/visit-the-museum/">museums</a> and enjoying a Swedish fika) and public spaces that are enhanced by the rain (including a <a href="https://www.goteborg.com/en/rain-playground/">rain playground</a> and <a href="https://www.goteborg.com/en/the-sauna-in-frihamnen/">sauna made of recycled materials</a>). The food and drink scene unsurprisingly leans heavily on local ingredients, with global influences resulting in diversity in how these ingredients are presented. From a Michelin-starred fine dining restaurant atop a hotel powered by wind to a cafeteria with carbon footprints listed next to menu items, here are some of the best places to grab sustainable fare in Gothenburg.</p>

      <p>A Michelin-starred restaurant atop a boutique hotel of the same name, Upper House Dining highlights seasonal ingredients in a la carte and tasting menus. The restaurant has recently appointed a new head chef, Ola Wallin, who is expanding the casual dining aspect. The fine dining experience remains, but instead of a 4-hour, 16-course tasting menu there are a greater number of a la carte options and smaller tasting menus (4 and 6 courses). Sustainability remains a central focus for the restaurant, which is completely fueled by wind power (as is the massive hotel complex it is part of). On the roof are two beehives that are home to approximately 60,000-100,000 bees (the highest beekeeping facility in Sweden), and restaurant waste is composted, digested and converted into biogas, which is used to fuel cookware.</p>

      <p>This beloved amusement park, which opened in 1923, is situated in the heart of Gothenburg and sees approximately 4 million guests each year. Sustainability is a top priority for the park, which releases a <a href="https://www.liseberg.com/b593b148/globalassets/om-liseberg/arsredovisningar/hallbarhetsredovisningar/liseberg_hallbarhetsredovisning_2018_en_low.pdf">Sustainability Report</a> every year and has made it an integrated part of the company’s business planning and development. Top goals for 2019 were reducing disposable plastic items, reducing food waste, and improving the recycling of waste. In between enjoying the 40+ rides and attractions at the park, you can grab a cone of candy floss (cotton candy) made from organic, <a href="https://www.krav.se/in-english/krav-standards/">KRAV-certified</a> sugar.</p>

      <p>This former pop-up restaurant moved into a permanent space at the Clarion Hotel Post earlier this year. Japanese-inspired fare is made using sustainably sourced and traceable Swedish ingredients from like-minded suppliers, and greens like fresh wasabi come from the hotel’s rooftop garden. The Chef’s Choice tasting menu with an optional beverage package that includes pairings for each course is a curated 6-course menu that showcases the ingredients of the season.</p>

      <p>A trip to Sweden isn’t complete without a fika (Swedish coffee break), and Da Matteo is a popular choice with several locations throughout the city. Da Matteo has been purchasing, roasting and selling <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-fancy-coffee-is-expensive_n_5bd9faefe4b0da7bfc169d29">specialty coffee</a> from small-scale producers <a href="https://damatteo.se/pages/trulyspecial">since 2007</a>, and they roast the traceable, high-quality beans they source in an environmentally friendly roaster. Pair your cup of specialty coffee with a Swedish pastry and take a moment to relax and unwind.</p>

      <p>This light-filled eatery at Lindholmen Science Park is a go-to lunch spot for students and employees in the area (mainly businesses that work on leading development projects), however it’s open to the public. A frequently changing lunch menu includes a choice of a vegan, fish, meat, or salad main course, with a self-serve salad bar. Next to each main you’ll find the <a href="https://chalmerskonferens.se/en/lunchmenyer-lindholmen/">corresponding carbon footprint</a>. </p>

      <p>This cozy bistro serves a vegetable-forward menu that’s complemented by an extensive selection of natural wines. For those new to natural wines, the restaurant staff is ready with recommendations based on your preferences, and there’s an option to order three glasses of natural wine—a curated selection with your choice of “clean” or “messy” wine packages.</p>

      <p>Well worth the 30-minute trek by car or train from the city center, Garveriet in Floda is a riverside tannery-turned-multifunctional space with a bakery, cafe, restaurant, shop and conference space. Sustainability is steeped into everything they do, from ingredients sourced within a 200-kilometer (124-mile) radius to zero-waste cooking classes. Pick up a loaf of fresh-baked bread made in-house in a wood-burning oven and check out the mini-store stocked with local produce and products.</p>
