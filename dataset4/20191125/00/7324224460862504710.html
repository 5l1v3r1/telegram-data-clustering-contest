      <p>She said: “When he was seven weeks old we took him to Goodwood Festival of Speed for his first car event and he went in a Rolls-Royce.</p>
      <p>“I also took him in a Ferrari recently.</p>
      <p>“I’d love him to be a car enthusiast. If he turns round and says he wants to be a racing driver I’d support him in whatever he wants to do, but I hope he doesn’t.</p>
      <p>“I want him to pick something safe.”</p>
      <p>Shields, who has a racing licence and has also hosted on ITV4 and Sky Sports F1, said the first six months of motherhood have “flown by in a flash”.</p>
      <p>She added: “People always say they’ll be graduating before you know it, and I can relate to that now. You have to make the most of it.”</p>
      <p>Shields revealed Arthur was born three weeks early and had a speedy entrance to the world, arriving via emergency Caesarean just an hour and 10 minutes after they had gone to hospital.</p>
      <p>She said: “My midwife put her arm round me and we virtually ran into theatre.</p>
      <p>“I’d planned a water birth but the emergency Caesarean was a brilliant experience, it was just a different one.”</p>
