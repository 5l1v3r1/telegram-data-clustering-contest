        <b>Paulo Dybala sees similarities between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo having played with them for Argentina and Juventus respectively.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://es.besoccer.com/jugador/l-messi-23569">Lionel Messi</a> and <a href="https://es.besoccer.com/jugador/l-messi-23569">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> are "monsters" <b>who are convinced they are the best player on the pitch </b>in every game, according to Argentina and <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> forward <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/p-dybala-115525/">Paulo Dybala</a>.</p>
      <p><b>The duo are among the greatest players of all time</b> and have won a combined 10 Ballon d'Or trophies since 2008. Dybala has played alongside Ronaldo at Serie A champions Juve since the Portugal international's move from Real Madrid ahead of the 2018-19 campaign and has teamed up with Barcelona superstar Messi for Argentina over the last four years. Having seen both players at close quarters, <b>the 26-year-old believes they share a lot of similarities</b>.</p>
      <p>"<b>Outside the pitch they are two very quiet people</b>, but inside they are two monsters," he told Spanish newspaper El Pais.  "I heard Luis Scola [Argentinian basketball player] said both Leo and Cristiano enter the field convinced that they are the best and that is why they are the best. <b>And I am sure that is so.</b></p>

      <p>"My friends used to tell me: 'You have the best in the national team and now they bring you the best one at your club'. I replied:<b> 'It is an advantage for me</b>.' I can study them every day. Who doesn't want to play with the best? We are talking about two phenomenal players; two players who are one or two steps above the rest.  <b>They are at the top on a football level </b>and also at a mental level. It is not easy to keep going and score 40 goals every year. It is crazy.  In the history of football, great players have played at great teams and have not achieved what they did. <b>They have been good for each other</b>."</p>
