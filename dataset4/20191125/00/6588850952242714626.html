      <p>Infinix, a premium online-driven smartphone brand designed for the young generations, announced the launch of the S5, a device with the biggest Infinity-O Display under GHC 1000! <br/><br/>S5 is also the device boasts the most “bests” in this price range, from being the device with the biggest Infinity-O Display, one of the few devices with a 32MP In-Display AI selfie camera, the only device with 4 AI rear cameras, to offering the best memory options – 4GB RAM+64G ROM and 6GB RAM+128GB ROM. S5 is expected to empower users with excellent smartphone experience in its price range.<br/><br/>“At Infinix, we’re committed to bringing the latest technologies to young consumers in global emerging markets, keeping them on trend and up-to-date, whilst empowering them to be trend-setters in their communities. The launch of the S5 is a great manifesto of our brand purpose, as well as the mission of the S series – great selfies and placing consumers at the center of attention. With so many ‘bests’ in this price range, we’re confident that our customers will be able to stand out from the crowd!” Said Benjamin Jiang, Managing Director of Infinix Mobile. <br/><br/>“Infinix S5 is powered by MediaTek Helio P22 processor giving consumers the latest smartphone features and great technologies at an affordable price, like support for 32MP In-Display AI selfie camera and 4 AI rear cameras. The power-efficient Helio P22 allows MediaTek and device makers to bring ‘New Premium’ devices to market and reshapes expectations of what an affordable selfie camera smartphone can deliver.” Rami Osman Director Africa and the Middle East-MediaTek.<br/><br/>Let’s explore the way of being a trend-setter with Infinix S5!<br/><br/><b>Slay with the biggest Infinity-O Display!</b><br/><br/>One of the key highlights of S5 is its 6.6-inch HD+ Infinity-O Display, which makes it the biggest Infinity-O Display smartphone under GHC 1000 in the Ghanaian market. The Infinity-O Display adopts a slimmer, bezel-less design, which allows S5 to achieve a 90.5% screen-to-body ratio. With a 20:9 screen aspect ratio which follows the current cinema screen trends, S5 will provide users with a brilliant viewing experience. Immerse yourself in video streaming, gaming and image capturing!<br/><br/><b>Seek brilliant selfies with 32MP In-Display AI selfie camera!</b><br/><br/>S5 sports a 32MP In-Display AI selfie camera with 1.6 μm larger pixels (after 4-in-1), F2.0 aperture and 4-in-1 super pixel technology. When users are taking photos, the In-Display AI selfie camera automatically implements a 4-in-1 effect based on the ISO value, at which point the size of a single pixel reaches 1.6 μm, enabling consumers to capture sharp, vivid selfies especially in low-light and backlight environments. HDR+ is the new technology on S5. It’s the combination of Face recognition, Intelligent scene recognition and AI HDR technology, which enable users to capture impressive and artistic portraits. S5 is no doubt a backlit portrait master. What’s more, S5’s selfie camera supports an upgraded 3D Face Beauty function and provides 4 exclusive options to let consumers customize their beauty style.<br/><br/><b>Swag with the 4 AI rear cameras for artistic backlit portraits! </b><br/><br/>S5 is equipped with 4 AI rear cameras and quad-smart flash. The rear camera consists of a 16MP AF high resolution camera, an ultra-wide-angle lens &amp; macro lens camera, a depth field camera and an AI lens camera. With the macro lens, users will get closer to the subjects they want to capture and see every vivid detail. In addition, with the ultra-wide-angle lens and macro lens, users can create wide-angle and macro videos in video capturing mode, which is a great improvement in comparison with the last generation.<br/><br/><b>Be Sharp with S5’s crystal feather pattern design!</b><br/><br/>Inspired by the nature and Quetzal bird, S5 adopts a crystal feather pattern design. To bring the inspiration to life and ensure that the gradient colors and patterns are perfectly presented on the devices, Infinix teams have invested tremendous efforts and conquered a lot of difficulties. The design of S5 is a manifesto of how Infinix strikes to combine stylish design with the latest technologies and the device is available in three colors – Quetzal Cyan, Nebula Black and Violet. <br/><br/>S5 is equipped with a 4000mAh big battery with Xcharge function. It adopts a MediaTek Helio P22 processor and runs on the Android 9 Pie system. Together with so many “bests” in the under GHC 1000 price range, from being the device with the biggest Infinity-O Display, one of the few devices with a 32MP In-Display AI selfie camera, the only device with 4 AI rear cameras, to offering the best memory options – 4GB RAM+64G ROM and 6GB RAM+128GB ROM, Infinix is confident that the S5 will bring an outstanding smartphone experience to young consumers and make them become trend-setters!<br/><br/>Jumia: <a href="https://www.jumia.com.gh/infinix/">https://www.jumia.com.gh/infinix/</a><br/><br/>Official website: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/InfinixMobileGH/">https://www.facebook.com/InfinixMobileGH/</a><br/>X-Park: <a href="https://gh.xpark.com/">https://gh.xpark.com/</a> <br/>Specifications of S5 and S5 Lite:</p>
