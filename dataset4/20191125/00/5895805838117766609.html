      <p>Consider it this way.</p>
      <p>Nationally, we already devote special days to recognize the contributions of moms and dads whose tireless efforts go largely socially unappreciated, taken for granted and so often ignored.</p>
      <p>Such an affirmation of mothering and fathering can mean a lot. “Thank you for thinking about how I am, what I've done, and all I try to do.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Someone is left out</b>
      </p>
      <p>But what about the objects of their care, particularly that beleaguered population of young people slogging and stumbling through their ten to twelve year trial and error coming of age passage?</p>
      <p>These are the growing up years between separating from older <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/child-development">childhood</a> (around 9 - 13) and entering young adulthood (around 18 -23.) We name this exciting coming of age passage '<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/adolescence">adolescence</a>,' the transformational journey toward supporting a functional social independence and assuming a fitting individual <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/identity">identity</a>. What about a special day for them?</p>
      <p>What about recognizing these “teenagers” who must bravely face the risks of growing older, who must contend with a multitude of doubts and worries, fears and frustrations, uncertainties and insecurities? "I wake up each morning to face the mirror and see how my looks have or haven't changed since yesterday!"</p>
      <p>Somehow they must get and keep themselves together during the push and shove of offline and online relationships with peers while coping with increasing responsibility and the next step demands of acting older. During this life-changing process, it is easy to feel overwhelmed and out of control. “It’s scary when I think of all the challenges ahead!”</p>
      <p>I’m talking about adolescents who can feel unacknowledged for all their struggles, sometimes taking one step back for every two steps forward, who can find it easier to criticize themselves for failing than to compliment themselves for trying. “What’s the matter with me?” “I can’t do anything right!” “I’ll never learn!” Much discouragement is kept to themselves as they bravely keep on keeping on.</p>
      <p>As for at home, there can be times of feeling they cause parents more <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stress</a> than satisfaction, more <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">anxiety</a> than admiration, more irritation than enjoyment. “There’s always something I’m not doing right or enough!” Adolescents can frequently feel they are falling short of the parental approval mark.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Adolescent Appreciation Day</b>
      </p>
      <p>So just suppose parents announce as a surprise that they wish to celebrate <i>Adolescent Appreciation Day.</i> On this affirmative occasion, they might suspend normal chore demands, prepare some special eats and maybe take in some favored entertainment or activity. Most important, however, in spoken or written form, they give thanks by giving the young person<i> a Statement of Valuing </i>that specifically itemizes many of the positives in the teenager that parents want to take this occasion to communicate.</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>· What you have accomplished over the past year,</li>
        <li>· What we enjoy about your company,</li>
        <li>· What we learn from you,</li>
        <li>· What we admire about you,</li>
        <li>· What we appreciate your doing,</li>
        <li>· What we love about your human being,</li>
        <li>· What you can do that we cannot,</li>
        <li>· What ways you matter to us,</li>
        <li>· What you do that raises our spirits,</li>
        <li>· What special gifts you have,</li>
        <li>· What memories we have that both enjoy,</li>
        <li>· What causes us to laugh together,</li>
        <li>· What experiences we share that means a lot,</li>
        <li>· What joys you bring into our lives,</li>
        <li>· And whatever else you can think to add.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>The power of affirmation</b>
      </p>
      <p>Embedded in an insecure age of growing through relentless developmental change, to see themselves so positively reflected in parental eyes can mean a lot. “I’m not just a bunch of problems after all; in a lot of ways I'm okay.”</p>
      <p>Such an affirmation day doesn’t deny whatever trials and troubles may also be going on, but it does help parents restore a more balanced perspective. “Concerned as we are, there’s much good going on and much bad that is not.” And now parents lift their fatigued veil of frustration and worry and see their teenager in fuller and more reassuring terms.</p>
      <p>When tired parents give their teenager a day of appreciation, they create a win/win situation for everyone. Not only does the teenager receive a positive boost, but they give themselves a much needed perceptual reset as well. “Putting our momentary concerns aside, in the larger scheme of things, there is much about our teenager to be <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gratitude">grateful</a> for, and we are using this day to tell them and ourselves how this is so.”</p>
