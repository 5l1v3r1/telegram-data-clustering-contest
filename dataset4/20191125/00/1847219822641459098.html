        <b>Latvia has the most unfavourable pricing mechanism for medicines and market, in which prices of the most often bought state-compensated medicines are compared with other Baltic States, as concluded by Competition Council.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The report mentions that the end prices are compiled from the producer price, wholesale trader’s markup, pharmacy markup and VAT. In Baltic States, the most considerable changes in price structure are created by markups from wholesale traders and pharmacies, as well as VAT, which is 12% in Latvia, 9% in Estonia and 5% in Lithuania. The markup in Latvia is formed by wholesale traders applying growing percentage markup on top of the producer’s price, whereas pharmacies apply the markup to wholesale trader’s price.</p>
      <p>In Lithuania and Estonia, both markups are applied with a limit, which prevents prices from growing significantly. The limit on the markup in Latvia is set for pharmacies and only for state-compensated medicines.</p>
      <p>By comparing approximately 20 most popular medicines in Baltic States, CC found that in most cases producers in Latvia had set a lower price for Latvian wholesale traders. However, because of the markup, this was not reflected in the end price.</p>
      <h3>Producers had set prices lower than those in Lithuania and Estonia for approximately 80% of surveyed medicines. Only 40% of them are procured by people at prices lower in comparison to Lithuania and Estonia.</h3>
      <p>CC surveyed the differences among price-setting mechanisms for medicines in Baltic States and the effect they have on compensated and non-compensated medicines. After comparing medicine price regulations in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, CC concluded that Latvia has the least favourable price-setting mechanism.</p>
      <p>Latvia’s mechanism provides that as the price increases, markup of wholesale traders and pharmacies is to reduce in percentage. However, it only increases in reality.</p>
      <p>Data shows that in Latvia consumers most often pick compensated and non-compensated medicines that cost up to EUR 50.</p>
      <p>Estimates also point to the possibility that Latvia’s medicine price-setting mechanism for wholesale traders is favourable, because it allows for setting relatively high maximum price markup.</p>
      <p>Similar conclusions have been made for markups of pharmacies in Latvia. For example, pharmacy markup for factory medicine package worth EUR 20 may reach EUR 4.92, whereas the markup in Lithuania is EUR 3.57 and EUR 3.09 in Estonia. As producer prices increase, there is a percentage increase of Latvian pharmacies, whereas markups for non-compensated medicines in Lithuania and Estonia remain unchanged at a certain procurement price threshold.</p>

      </p>
      <p>«A comparison of wholesale trader and pharmacy markups in Baltic States, Latvia’s highest markup is not just for the cheapest medicines that cost under EUR 3.5. As the price increases, so does the markup difference in Latvia. Under such a markup system, differences are the most sensitive for non-compensated non-prescribed medicines because wholesale traders and producers have a wide range of freedom. At the same time, there is vertical integration and insufficient independence of pharmacies,» admits the competition supervisor.</p>
      <p>As noted by CC, Baltic markets are relatively similar and medicine prices should not differ considerably. CC believes it is necessary to review price-setting mechanism for medicines and look at the levels and reason behind overpaying.</p>
