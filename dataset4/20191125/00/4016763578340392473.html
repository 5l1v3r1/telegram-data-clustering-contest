      <p>A <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/kanye-west-details-nebuchadnezzar-opera/">press release</a> explained the origins of the opera:</p>
      <blockquote>West conceived of this opera as an expression of his commitment to both his faith and ever-expanding musical palette. <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> brings together elements from different worlds, including opera, fine art, modern dance, and gospel music, to create an innovative performance structure. West’s sound is the bridge between these artforms.</blockquote>
