      </p>
      <p>Referred to as the Nobel Prize of pharmaceutical research, it is the most prestigious award in the field of Canadian pharmaceutical research - recognising the efforts and achievements of pharmaceutical research and development and innovation.</p>
      <p>Based at the University of Toronto, Professor O’Dowd shares the award with fellow university Professor Susan R George.</p>
      <p>The pair, professors in toxicology and pharmacology respectively, received the Prix Gallen Canada – Research Award for inventing a new method to discover drugs.</p>
      <p>The method directs receptor proteins to the cell nucleus, however if interacting drugs are present, the receptor proteins remain at the cell surface – representing a new paradigm for drug discovery.</p>
      <p>They are also being recognised for identifying 70 receptor proteins, additional new members of the G protein coupled receptor family.</p>
      <p>The research provides potential for enhanced drug arsenals targeting many unmet medical needs and deficits in treatments.</p>
      <p>Born and raised in Dublin, Professor O'Dowd was educated at Ringsend Technical Institute and De La Salle College in Churchtown.</p>
      <p>Of his award, he told The Irish Post: “It is very gratifying to me to see how our drug discovery invention has developed and will be used to discover useful therapies.</p>
      <p>“I lost my 23-year-old son Paul to cancer and some of these newly discovered receptor proteins may prove essential for improved treatments.</p>
      <p>"The research provides potential for enhanced drug arsenals targeting many unmet medical needs and deficits in treatments.”</p>
      <p>Professor O’Dowd has a PhD from the University of Toronto and completed a Post-Doc with Nobel Prize-winning scientist Dr Robert Lefkowitz at Duke University in North Carolina.</p>
