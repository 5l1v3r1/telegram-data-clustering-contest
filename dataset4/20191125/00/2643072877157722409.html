      <h1>2023 Presidency: Most Leaders Of Southern Nigeria Are Cowards – Fani-Kayode</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Enioluwa Adeniyi</a></address>
      <p>The minister of aviation under the Goodluck Jonathan Administration, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/femi-fani-kayode/"><u><b>Femi Fani-Kayode</b></u></a>, has described some leaders from the Southern part of Nigeria as cowards.</p>
      <p>The former minister stated this while reacting to the comment by the acting Chairman of Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF, Alhaji Musa Liman Kwande, that Northerners will vote for only a presidential candidate of northern origin in 2023 presidential election irrespective of the political party.</p>
      <p>Kwande while speaking over the weekend charged Northerners to work towards developing the region by voting for individuals who are pro-development and not those who are self-centred.</p>
      <p>Fani-Kayode in his view stated that the alleged cowardice of Southern leaders gave room for Kwande to make such a statement.</p>
      <p>The former minister who took to his Twitter account wrote, <i>“In 2023 people from the northern part of the country will vote for a presidential candidate from that region irrespective of the party – Musa Liman, Acting Chairman of ACF.”</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“If not for the cowardice of most southern leaders you would not have the nerve to speak like this”</i>
