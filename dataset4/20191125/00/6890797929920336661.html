      <p>In its pre-Budget submission, National Seniors has <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/cut-politicians-super-boost-pensioner-incomes-says-seniors-group-20191121-p53csf.html">demanded</a> the Morrison Government reduce the taper rate by which the Aged Pension is phased-out:</p>
      <blockquote>It wants to reduce the taper rate, which reduces the age pension for people depending on the value of their assets. The taper rate was lifted by then-treasurer Scott Morrison more than two years ago.<br/><br/>The organisation argues the current $3 taper rate means someone with $800,000 in assets is receiving less income than someone with $400,000 in assets.</blockquote>
