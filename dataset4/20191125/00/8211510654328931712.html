      <h2>Formula E is fast becoming the obvious 'plan B' for Formula 1 drivers</h2>

      <p>That is the view of Felipe Massa, the former 11-time grand prix winner for Ferrari who now drives in the increasingly popular all-electric series.</p>
      <p>Mercedes and Porsche have signed up for the new Formula E season, which kicks off this weekend in Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>Other former F1 drivers on the grid are Brendon Hartley, Pascal Wehrlein, Stoffel Vandoorne and others, while the new Formula 2 champion Nyck de Vries is racing for the new works Mercedes team.</p>
      <p>And while Formula 1 features only four carmakers, in Formula E there are six, also including Audi, BMW, Nissan and Jaguar.</p>
      <p>“Formula E is doing exactly what needs to be done. It is growing,” 38-year-old Massa told the Mirror.</p>
      <p>“When a championship is growing and getting bigger and bigger, all the big names are interested. It was the only championship I was looking to come and race after Formula 1.”</p>
      <p>Formula E aside, there are still multiple premier racing categories for professional drivers to consider, like Indycar, Super Formula, WEC and DTM.</p>
      <p>Massa said: “I concentrate on Formula E, because I believe in the future of Formula E more than I believe in the future of the other championship.</p>
      <p>“I am sure that any driver that does not have the possibility to stay in Formula 1, they will try and come to Formula E. I am 100 per cent sure.</p>
      <p>“Every driver here can race in Formula 1 and everyone here can be successful in Formula 1 in the end,” added the Brazilian.</p>
