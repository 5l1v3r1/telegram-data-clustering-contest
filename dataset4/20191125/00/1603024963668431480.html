      <p>Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk indicated in a tweet that the electric carmaker received 200,000 orders for its electric pickup truck within three days of its launch.</p>
      <p>Musk, who has been regularly tweeting about the Cybertruck's features since its launch late Thursday, has also been updating his followers with the number of orders the company has received.</p>
      <p>In an earlier tweet, Musk said the company had received 146,000 orders for Cybertruck, and tweeted again on Sunday saying "200K" - an apparent reference to the number of orders.</p>
      <p>The company's website shows that an immediate payment of $100 is required to reserve an order for the Cybertruck, which has a starting price of $39,900.</p>
      <p>The launch of its futuristic pickup on Thursday suffered a setback when the electric vehicle's "armored glass" windows shattered in a much-anticipated unveiling. The overall look of the electric vehicle had worried Wall Street on Friday, driving the automaker's shares to close 6.1% lower.</p>
      <p>During the launch, Musk had taken aim at the design, power and durability of mainstream trucks, only to be shaken when his boast about his new vehicle's windows backfired.</p>
      <p>Separately, Musk said the Cybertruck is Tesla's last product unveil for a while.</p>
      <p>Tesla plans to start manufacturing the Cybertruck around late-2021.</p>
