      <p>Children exposed to roadside air pollution could have their lung growth stunted by up to 14%, a study suggests.<br/><br/>Living within 50m of a major road could increase the risk of lung cancer by up to 10%, the paper also found.<br/><br/>The study of 13 cities in the UK and Poland found air pollution contributes to a higher chance of heart disease, strokes, heart failure and bronchitis.<br/><br/>Campaigners called on the government to commit to tackling "dangerous" air pollution in the UK.<br/><br/>The report written by King's College London analysed 13 health conditions in people living in high pollution areas and compared them to the general population.<br/><br/>It focused not just on hospital admissions and deaths but also symptoms such as chest infections.<br/><br/>The study found roadside air pollution stunted lung growth in children by approximately 14% in Oxford, 13% in London, 8% in Birmingham, 5% in Liverpool, 3% in Nottingham and 4% in Southampton.<br/><br/>Researchers also said if air pollution was cut by a fifth, there would be thousands fewer cases of children with symptoms of bronchitis across those UK cities.<br/><br/>'Public health crisis'<br/><br/>"Air pollution makes us, and especially our children, sick from cradle to the grave, but is often invisible," said Dr Rob Hughes, senior fellow at the Clean Air Fund.<br/><br/>"This impressive research makes this public health crisis - which affects people all across the UK - visible, and shows the urgency with which all political parties must prioritise cleaning up our air."<br/><br/>Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, called on the UK government to legally commit to the World Health Organisation's targets to clean up the country's "dangerous" air.<br/><br/>WHO's clean air target is for 40 µg/m3 - 40 micrograms of annual nitrogen dioxide per cubic metre of air.<br/><br/>"It seems as if every day we see more and more evidence of the terrible health effects air pollution is having on our lungs," Dr Woods said.<br/><br/>"It's the most vulnerable that are hit hardest," she added.<br/><br/>"We know air pollution stunts our children's still-developing lungs and those with a lung condition can find their symptoms are made far worse by poor air quality."<br/><br/>The group behind the study - a coalition of 15 health and environment NGOs, including the British Lung Foundation - is calling for a national network of Clean Air Zones across the UK.<br/><br/>Toxic air pollution in central London has reportedly fallen by a third since the introduction of a new traffic charging zone.<br/>Levels of nitrogen dioxide in the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) dropped by 30% in the first six months of the scheme, according to City Hall.
