        <b>Benzema is currently top of the table after his excellent start to the season. However, he is closely followed by Leo Messi who is 1 goal behind.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After matchday 14, <b>Benzema finds himself top with 10 goals</b>. The Frenchman has had a fine start to the season and got <b>his 10th as Real Madrid came from behind to beat Real Sociedad 3-1.</b></p>
      <p>He is closely followed by <b>Messi, Morón and Moreno who all have 8 goals</b>. Messi has been on fire since he came back from injury. He even got a <b>hat-trick against Celta Vigo</b> and will be hoping to add to his tally in next week's match against Atlético Madrid.</p>
