      <h3>Sam Omatseye</h3>
      <p>The road has always fascinated our species. It is the outlet out there. Even the philosopher Immanuel Kant, who hated to travel taught our minds to move into the future via his metaphysical highway, so he gave us what we call the Kantian teleology.</p>
      <p>No government, no club, no school, no god operates without the road. It is our ticket out of and into our selves. So, it is little wonder that development is nothing without it. Now that we are in the dry season, the main reason we have wondered why the rains will not go away is no other than we want to leave the house. But when we leave the house, the home follows us to the road – in our imaginations, in our appetites and romances, in our dialogues, in our domestic plans, in our work.</p>
      <p>Even if we know no asphalt can resist a downpour, we still sulk that the roads should be fixed. Is it the failure of human artifice, the shortfall of technology, or the supremacy of the element? Everywhere the weather riles up, it routs our efforts. Hence in temperate climates, no roadwork in winter. Here the road is wounded when the sky tears up.</p>
      <p>So if you want to ruin a town, a party, a project, mess up the way. That can happen even in politics. So, while the Trojan of works, Babatunde Raji Fashola SAN ploughs the Nigerian road, we should not forget when the rain started to beat us under the Buhari regime. The rains did not begin in the clouds. Its first torrents sounded in the red chambers – in the Senate under presidency of Bukola Saraki, aka Eleyinmi.</p>
      <p>When the budget was presented, the chambers balked. They said the money was too much. But later we learned, it was not the billions that was too much but the ambition. He wanted to do more roads with much money. Fashola collided with them on two fronts. One, the senators wanted money in their pockets. Two, Saraki wanted to frustrate the Buhari government since he – Eleyinmi – was then a foe in the APC family and joining forces with the PDP.  They butchered the budget. The legislators wanted him to give them money for constituency projects. They presented road projects on roads that only existed in their imaginations, maps they conjured up. I call that a cartography of fiction. The Trojan of works was not going to be a party to the duels of politics and greed. The senators fought back, and the consequence was for him to have little money to do work in a country of many roads, roads to fit into the descriptions of G.K Chesterton’s poem, The Rolling English Road. He wrote about reeling roads, rolling roads, mazy roads, et al.</p>
      <p>Politics has consequences. So, he worked with what he had. Since his stewardship in the ministry, he has gulped up about 5000 kilometres of roads so far, which is significant. But in a nation of tens of thousands of roads, much is left to be done. The thing with roads is that when you travel, you don’t praise the good part, but we query the bad. The bad part slows journey, tortures the tyre, imperils the engine, slurps more fuel and prepares the body for the panel beater. The Lagos-Ibadan Expressway is going through its most concerted work since the project began, but many complain about the traffic. For all the abundant work done so far, no one will hail the Second Niger Bridge until we see the infrastructure rise out of the river.</p>
      <p>So are many roads now under construction or completed. Here are some of  them- Abuja–Kano; Ilorin–Jebba; Enugu-Port Harcourt; Benin–Sagamu; Arochukwu-Bende; Kano–Maiduguri dualisation; dualisation of Sapele–Ewu road Sections I and II; Apapa–Oworonsoki Road; Apapa-Wharf Road; Ikorodu- Sagamu; Sokoto-Tambuwal-Kontagora–Makera Road; Isoko Ring Road; Abak–Ekwarakwa Road; Obajana–Kabba, dualisation of Bayelsa Palm–Otuoke Road.</p>
      <p>There is no development without roads. The budget this year of N262 billion is little. But the budget excludes the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and the Second Niger Bridge since their funding come from a special infrastructure purse with the presidency.  At least this budget is not going to be slashed and this 9th Senate is not playing monkey games.</p>
      <p>So when Eleyinmi’Senate hurt the budget, they hurt the country. Lawmakers ought to see beyond their hidebound avarice and gamesmanship. If they had allowed abundant funding, more roads would be under construction today and more of the roads would have been completed. They did the same to the Customs boss Hammed Ali because he would not yield honey to the lawmakers’ lolling lips.</p>
      <p>The use of tax credit has drawn some flak, as though it is privilege. How would the Apapa-Wharf project or Obajana get into gear if Dangote and Flour Mills did not take advantage? Or the Sukuk facility? The NLNG is also constructing the Bodo-Bonny road along that principle.</p>
      <p>The complaints about roads show how development must be taken seriously. Especially roads. We are on the road more than we are in the house, either in deed or in thoughts. Sometimes when we are in the house, our homes are on the road. Historically the road is civilisation and history. There we worship, we party, we fight, we play, we plot, we make love, we die. Soyinka’s plays often happen on the road, apart from The Road. Whether it is <i>Lion and the Jewel</i>, <i>The Jero plays</i>, <i>Death and The King’s Horsemen</i>, or <i>Mad men</i> and <i>Specialists</i>, it is the place of his interpreters. Shakespeare and Dickens loved the Road, just as Achebe’s Things Fall Apart and even The Mad Man.</p>
      <p>The story of the Second World War cannot be written without how snow crippled Hitler’s army near Moscow. The Ore battle in the Civil War has gone into lore. Political campaigns are by definition road tours. In legends and history, we love the road. Moremi adventured, Lot’s wife looked back, Jacob wrestled and Paul was converted on the road. Whether it is Fagunwa’s <i>A Forest of A Thousand demons</i> or <i>Homer’s Odyssey</i>, it haunts.</p>
      <p>Any time I recall the great American novel, <i>The Road </i>by Jack Kerouac, I pray for the day when somebody would travel from state to state, his car cruising like sea on a tranquil  sea, without one complaint about a pot hole, a gully, a cater. That is what the Trojan of Works dreams. But money and politics must collaborate.</p>
