        <b>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer showed his frustration when analysing the Red Devils match against Sheffield United. He said that he would have taken the whole team off at half time.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United </a>slipped up again in the Premier League</b>. United turned around the scoreboard when they were losing 2-0 to Sheffield United, but they conceded a last-minute goal and threw almost all their work out the window.</p>
      <p>Long before United came back in the 2nd half, <b>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer showed his obvious frustration</b> at the squad at half time.</p>
      <p>He said after the match: "We were nowhere near Manchester United. <b>I would have changed all the players</b> at half-time. I was angry and disappointed".</p>

      <p>Solskjaer dodged the issue and denied that the problem came from his tactics. "<b>It wasn't a question of tactics</b>, but the desire to win in the 1st half. Win the first ball, win fights... some tactics go out the window because of these things", he explained.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils faced the match with a lot of players out and players such as Andreas Pereira and Fred were not up to the mark. However, the Norwegian praised their reaction.</p>
      <p>"<b>There was a great response in the second half and the taste is even positive</b>. Even though almost everything in the game is negative, the team's character to lift the match was touching.</p>
