      <p>Fast-forward more than a decade later and PDT has grown into a full-service communications company, specialising in a variety of technologies – which, according to PDT, enable businesses and enterprises to ‘dramatically improve client and staff engagement via the deployment of practical, sustainable and proven communications methodologies’.</p>
      <p><b>What is the core focus of your business?</b><br/>The core focus of PDT is to assist our customers in improving their communication by using digital displays. We have been doing this for 17 years and we always look for the best display technology or supplementary technologies we can use to help our customers get their messages to their audience.</p>
      <p><b>What have been the company’s biggest highlights for 2019?</b><br/>Being recognized at tt100 for our ability to find great innovations in the display industry and then having the courage to bring these technologies to South Africa for our customers. We have been doing this consistently over the years, so being recognized for our innovative attitude towards our industry was appreciated.</p>
      <p><b>Could you tell us about your future plans and upcoming programmes?</b><br/>The next few years our focus will be on expanding applications for the HyperVSN product. We are also doing a lot of R&amp;D work on how AI technologies, including things like chatbots, can be used to complement digital display messaging for our customers.</p>
      <p><b>Why are programmes like the tt100 beneficial to enterprises?</b><br/>Most companies spend so much time just working and never taking conscious time to evaluate if their innovation work is of value. Something like the tt100 is almost like taking an exam, where you have to opportunity to put forward your work to a panel of experts and getting their honest feedback.</p>
      <p>Honest feedback for any business and business owner is a very rare and valuable experience.</p>
      <p><b>How has winning the award impacted your business?</b><br/>It’s a bit early to say, but the response from family, friends, colleagues and customers have been very rewarding to me personally. Running a business is sometimes grinding and tiring work, so receiving a tap on the back is a great boost of energy. There is also a tangible pride amongst the staff of being associated with a company that wins awards.</p>
      <p><b>What advice would you give to future leaders who are starting out within the same industry?</b><br/>You need to innovate and differentiate your services to your customers. If you don’t bring customers value consistently over time, they will move to someone cheaper.</p>
