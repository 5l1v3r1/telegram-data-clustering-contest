        <b>Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone has said that while Ronaldo is great, he has told his players to focus on Juventus as a whole, not just him.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Diego Simeone labelled Cristiano Ronaldo the best player in the world</b> but warned his Atletico Madrid squad that <b>Juventus are far from a one-man team</b>.</p>
      <p>Former Real Madrid forward Ronaldo has scored <b>25 goals against Atletico in all competitions</b>, including a hat-trick when the sides met at the last-16 stage in the 2018-19 season.</p>
      <p>The Portugal international <b>drew a blank in the reverse fixture two months ago</b>, though, and has struggled for fitness in recent weeks, making him a doubt for the midweek clash.</p>
      <p>"He always played really well against us. <b>He is the number one, an amazing player</b>," Simeone said at Monday's pre-match news conference. <b>He always know how to create problems to his opponents</b>. But I don't think it will be just Ronaldo against Atletico Madrid. <b>We are here looking forward to playing</b> in this amazing stadium. And we want to play a great game"</p>

      <p><b>Juventus are already assured of a place in the knockout stages</b>, while Atletico can join them in the last 16 should they pick up all three points in Turin.</p>
      <p>However, <b>Atleti have won just one of their last five matches in all competitions</b> and Simeone is expecting another tough match against the Serie A leaders.</p>
      <p>"It will be a great game against a very strong and demanding team," he said.</p>
