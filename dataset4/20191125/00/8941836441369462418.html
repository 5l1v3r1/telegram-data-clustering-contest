      <h1>Washington Capitals want to play regular-season game in Russia or Swed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/adam-zielonka/" target="_blank">Adam Zielonka</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-capitals/">Washington Capitals</a> are interested in playing a regular-season game in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a>, which would mark a first for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nhl/">NHL</a>.</p>
      <p>“We’ve talked about different things overseas and we’ve talked about some in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a> or some in Sweden. We’re not sure; it’s a league decision,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-capitals/">Capitals</a> President Dick Patrick <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/11/25/capitals-interested-playing-an-nhl-regular-season-game-russia-soon-next-season/">told</a> The Washington Post, adding that if it comes to pass, it will be within the next two seasons.</p>
      <p>If the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nhl/">NHL</a> wants to put a regular-season game in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a>, no team makes more sense than the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-capitals/">Capitals</a>, led for the past 15 years by Alex Ovechkin, by far the most popular Russian in the league. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-capitals/">Capitals</a> have a high number of Russian players besides Ovechkin, including center Evgeny Kuznetsov and rookie goalie Ilya Samsonov.</p>
      <p>Similarly, Swedish center Nicklas Backstrom is a star in his home country, which could make the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-capitals/">Capitals</a> a logical choice the next time the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nhl/">NHL</a> returns to the hockey-loving Scandinavian country.</p>
      <p>The league has held <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-nhl/">the NHL</a> Global Series since 2017. In 2020, the Global Series will bring regular-season games to the Czech Republic and Finland and exhibition games against European teams to Germany and Switzerland.</p>

        <p>No <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nhl/">NHL</a> team has played in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a> since 2010, when the Carolina Hurricanes lost an exhibition game to SKA Saint Petersburg. In 1989, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-capitals/">Capitals</a> toured cities in the USSR to play exhibitions. But there has never been a regular-season <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nhl/">NHL</a> game held in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a>, a country of almost 150 million people.</p>
