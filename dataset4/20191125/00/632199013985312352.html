      <p>Transport for London (TfL) has decided not grant Uber a new private hire operator’s licence, in response to its latest application.</p>
      <p>Last year, Uber received a 15-month licence from the chief magistrate when it appealed TfL’s decision not to grant a new licence, which said it was not a “fit and proper” firm, citing concerns including passenger safety.</p>
      <p>The on-demand taxi firm has made a number of positive changes and improvements to its culture, leadership and systems in the period since the chief magistrate granted it a licence in June 2018. This includes interacting with TfL in a transparent and productive manner. However, TfL has identified a pattern of failures by the company including several breaches that placed passengers and their safety at risk.</p>
      <p>Despite addressing some of these issues, TfL said it does not have confidence that similar issues will not reoccur in the future, which has led it to conclude that the company is not fit and proper at this time.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/car-industry-news/2019/09/25/uber-granted-two-month-extension-to-private-hire-operating-licence">In September, Uber was granted a two-month licence as further information was required on these issues, some of which emerged late in the process of its reapplication.</a>
      </p>
      <p>A key issue identified was that a change to Uber’s systems allowed unauthorised drivers to upload their photos to other Uber driver accounts. This allowed them to pick up passengers as though they were the booked driver, which occurred in at least 14,000 trips - putting passenger safety and security at risk.</p>
      <p>This means all the journeys were uninsured and some passenger journeys took place with unlicensed drivers, one of which had previously had their licence revoked by TfL.</p>
      <p>Another failure allowed dismissed or suspended drivers to create an Uber account and carry passengers, again compromising passenger safety and security.</p>
      <p>Other serious breaches have also occurred, including several insurance-related issues. Some of these led TfL to prosecute Uber earlier this year for causing and permitting the use of vehicles without the correct hire or reward insurance in place.</p>
      <p>This pattern of regulatory breaches led TfL to commission an independent assessment of Uber’s ability to prevent incidents of this nature happening again. TfL concluded that it currently does not have confidence that Uber has a robust system for protecting passenger safety, while managing changes to its app.</p>
      <p>Legislation means that Uber now has 21 days to appeal, during which it can continue to operate pending any appeal and throughout any potential appeals process. Uber may seek to implement changes to demonstrate to a magistrate that it is fit and proper by the time of any appeal.</p>
      <p>Throughout this period, TfL will continue to closely scrutinise the private hire operator, which includes the need for Uber to meet the 20 conditions set by the London authority in September 2019. Particular attention will be paid to ensuring that the management have robust controls in place to manage changes to the Uber app so that passenger safety is not put at risk.</p>
      <p>Helen Chapman, director of Licensing, Regulation and Charging at TfL, said: “As the regulator of private hire services in London we are required to make a decision today on whether Uber is fit and proper to hold a licence. Safety is our absolute top priority. While we recognise Uber has made improvements, it is unacceptable that Uber has allowed passengers to get into minicabs with drivers who are potentially unlicensed and uninsured.</p>
      <p>“It is clearly concerning that these issues arose, but it is also concerning that we cannot be confident that similar issues won’t happen again in future. If they choose to appeal, Uber will have the opportunity to publicly demonstrate to a magistrate whether it has put in place sufficient measures to ensure potential safety risks to passengers are eliminated. If they do appeal, Uber can continue to operate and we will closely scrutinise the company to ensure the management has robust controls in place to ensure safety is not compromised during any changes to the app.”</p>
      <p>GMB praised TFL’s stance and says it fully expects the Supreme Court to uphold the ruling.</p>
      <p>Steve Garelick, GMB regional officer, said: “The company finally has to face up to the consequences of GMB’s landmark employment tribunal victory and change its ways.</p>
      <p>“Uber pulled more stunts than a Hollywood movie, now it’s time for them to accept their responsibilities.</p>
      <p>"We fully expect the Supreme Court to uphold the ruling of the Employment Tribunal, the Employment Appeal Tribunal and the Court of Appeal on driver’s worker rights in July.</p>
      <p>“GMB wants to protect honest drivers, but it’s perhaps time for them to look elsewhere to work.”</p>
