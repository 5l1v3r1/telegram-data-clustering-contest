      <h1>Klopp warns Liverpool over late escapes after Palace triumph</h1>

      <p>Jurgen Klopp urged Liverpool to stop relying on late goals following the physically taxing 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Roberto Firmino prodded home an 85th-minute winner at Selhurst Park to preserve the Premier League leaders' eight-point advantage over second-placed Leicester City.</p>
      <p>Sadio Mane put Liverpool ahead early in the second half, before Wilfried Zaha equalised eight minutes from full-time.</p>
      <p>Firmino's intervention means the European champions have now snatched vital points with goals in the 85th minute or later from four of their past six league fixtures.</p>
      <p>"You can't take it for granted," Reds boss Klopp told reporters.</p>
      <p>"I don't like to talk about it. I understand why you are asking. It's not like 'very good, seven minutes to go, let's start winning now'. That's not what we are like.</p>
      <p>"We don't think about it, we just know. We have had four years together. I know a lot about my team. </p>
      <p>"I know what we want, I know what we have to do for it. But we're not the only team who knows that. It was difficult fitness-wise at Palace because there were so many different things.</p>
      <p>"We know a lot, but we don't know exactly what the boys have been doing with their national teams. They are nine or 10 days away with their national teams. That's a lot of sessions."</p>
      <p>Liverpool forged their fruitful habit last season, notably squeezing past Tottenham and Newcastle United in the final weeks of an absorbing title battle with Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Andy Robertson, scorer in a thrilling turnaround against Aston Villa earlier this month, admitted decisive goals must start to come earlier.</p>
      <p>"Scoring late is good and enjoyable but we would much rather be 2-0 or 3-0 up and see out the game," the left-back said.</p>
      <p>"We cannot keep relying on it but it is good we have that mentality and we did not panic because we have been in this position so many times.</p>
      <p>"I think that is why we took control of the game and scored the winner."</p>
