      <p>The 20-year-old has missed a number of games this season with injury but he has still scored five goals and recorded three assists in eight league games for the French champions.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <i>Le Parisien</i>, Hazard praised Mbappe's quality and expressed his desire for the two to play for the same side, saying: "In a few years, he will certainly be the best player in the world.</p>
      <p>"This title, there are a lot of players who fight for it, but if he continues like this, Kylian will be one of the greatest footballers in the history of the world.</p>
      <p>"A footballer constantly dreams of playing alongside the best.</p>
      <p>"If tomorrow I could bring Kylian to Real Madrid, I would try. But not only is it not just me who can decide this, on top of that I don't even think I would be asked for my opinion."</p>
      <p>PSG reportedly want a world record Â£343m for Mbappe, who is expected to line up for the French champions when they face Madrid on Tuesday in the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/"><b>Champions League</b></a>.</p>
