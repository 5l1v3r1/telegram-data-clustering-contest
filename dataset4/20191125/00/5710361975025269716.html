      <h1>Canada’s Kirkland to Buy Gold Rival Detour for $3.7 Billion</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Bloomberg</a></address>
      <p>(Bloomberg) -- Canada’s Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd. (TSX:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/crocodile-gold-corp">KL</a>) agreed to buy Detour Gold Corp . (TSX:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/detour-gold-corp">DGC</a>) for C$4.9 billion ($3.7 billion), furthering an M&amp;A spree that’s swept the gold mining industry.</p>
      <p>With an all-share deal, Kirkland will take advantage of a record stock price to acquire the company, which operates the Detour Lake mine in northeastern Ontario. The agreement values Detour at C$27.50 a share, a 24% premium to the closing price on Friday.</p>
      <p>There’s been constant speculation about gold mining acquisitions after huge deals rocked the industry in the last year: Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/newmont-mining">NEM</a>).’s acquisition of Goldcorp Inc. and Barrick Gold Corp.’s takeover of Randgold Resources (LON:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/randgold-resources">RRS</a>) Ltd. The two combinations created companies that dwarf the rest of the industry and mean that smaller miners feel the need to consolidate if they’re going to stay relevant to shareholders.</p>
      <p>“The addition of Detour Lake provides an opportunity to add a third cornerstone asset that is located in our backyard,” Tony Makuch, chief executive officer of Kirkland, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Detour shareholstateders will receive 0.4343 share of Kirkland, according to the statement. After the deal is completed, existing Kirkland shareholders will own 73% of the new company, with Detour owners holding the rest.</p>
      <p>Kirkland’s stock price has surged in the past three years, climbing more than 800%, as profits soared. That’s put the company in a strong position to expand.</p>
      <p>The Detour Lake gold mine is expected to produce for more than 20 years and can generate 600,000 ounces a year. It’s about the same size as Kirkland’s biggest project, the Fosterville mine in Australia.</p>
      <p>Detour shares have almost doubled this year, helped by a rally in gold prices. Paulson &amp; Co. led an overthrow of the board in 2018 after a bitter proxy battle, in which he called for the company to put itself up for sale.</p>
      <p>The new entity would have gold production of about 1.5 million ounces in 2019 and free cash flow of $700 million, Kirkland said.</p>
