      <p>MELBOURNE, Nov 25 — Australia is investigating allegations that China tried to install an agent in a parliamentary seat in Canberra, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation said in a rare statement, adding it was taking the matter seriously.</p>
      <p>The spy agency issued the statement late yesterday after allegations were aired on Australian television that a suspected Chinese espionage ring offered A$1 million (RM2.83 million) to pay for a Melbourne luxury car dealer, Bo “Nick” Zhao, to run for a seat in Australia's federal parliament.</p>
      <p>“The reporting on Nine's <i>Sixty Minutes</i> contains allegations that AsioO takes seriously,” Asio Director-General of Security Mike Burgess said in the statement.</p>
      <p>“Australians can be reassured that Asio was previously aware of matters that have been reported today, and has been actively investigating them,” he said.</p>
      <p>Officials at China's embassy in Canberra were not immediately available for comment.</p>
      <p>Zhao told Asio about the alleged approach from another Melbourne businessman about a year ago, the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> said in the joint report with 60 Minutes and <i>The Age</i> newspaper, citing Zhao's associates and Western security sources.</p>
      <p>Zhao was found dead in March in a Melbourne motel room.</p>
      <p>Asio's Burgess said he would not comment further and that the matter was subject to a coronial inquiry. He said he was committed to protecting Australia's democracy and sovereignty.</p>
      <p>“Hostile foreign intelligence activity continues to pose a real threat to our nation and its security. ASIO will continue to confront and counter foreign interference and espionage in Australia,” his statement said.</p>
      <p>Resource-rich Australia's ties with its most important trading partner China have deteriorated in recent years, amid accusations that Beijing is meddling in domestic affairs.</p>
      <p>The latest allegations followed separate reports that a Chinese defector who said he was an intelligence operative gave a sworn statement to Asio detailing how China funds and conducts political interference in Taiwan, Australia and Hong Kong. — Reuters</p>
