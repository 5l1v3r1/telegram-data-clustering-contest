      <h1>Checkers launches free 1-hour deliveries in Sandton and Cape Town</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/jamie-mckane" target="_blank">Jamie McKane</a></address>
      <p>Checkers has launched a one-hour grocery delivery service named Sixty60, which is available in select locations in Sandton, Johannesburg, and Cape Town.</p>
      <p>The company said the service is South Africa’s first 60-minute grocery delivery offering from a supermarket chain.</p>
      <p>This platform is available through the Sixty60 app, which allows shoppers to order groceries and drinks at the touch of a button. Using the app, customers can track the status of their order and delivery in real-time.</p>
      <p>Checkers said that the prices for products on the Sixty60 app offer “the same value for money for which Checkers is renowned”.</p>
      <p>“Sixty60 will offer unrivalled convenience because it does all the hard work for you,” said Shoprite Checkers chief on innovation and strategy Neil Schreuder.</p>
      <p>“In our time-pressed society, providing consumers with a swift, on-demand grocery delivery service is like giving them back time: today’s most precious commodity.”</p>
      <h3>Testing and locations</h3>
      <p>Checkers has been testing the Sixty60 service with its own employees for months and has now made the offering available to the public in selected locations.</p>
      <p>Products on the Sixty60 app are priced the same as products found in Checkers stores, and delivery is completely free for the time being during the pilot period.</p>
      <p>Below are the locations which are supported by Sixty60 during the trial period.</p>

      <p>“The name Sixty60 captures the service’s main ambition: for customers to order groceries in sixty seconds and have them delivered in as little as sixty minutes,” Schreuder said.</p>
      <p>The beta version of the Sixty60 app is available for download from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=za.co.shoprite.sixty60&amp;gl=ZA"><b>Google Play Store</b></a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/za/app/sixty60/id1453556093"><b>App Store</b></a>.</p>
