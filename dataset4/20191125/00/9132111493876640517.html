      <p>Children exposed to roadside air pollution could have their lung growth stunted by up to 14%, a study suggests.</p>
      <p>Living within 50m of a major road could increase the risk of lung cancer by up to 10%, the paper also found.</p>
      <p>The study of 13 cities in the UK and Poland found air pollution contributes to a higher chance of heart disease, strokes, heart failure and bronchitis.</p>
      <p>Campaigners called on the government to commit to tackling "dangerous" air pollution in the UK.</p>
      <p>The report written by King's College London analysed 13 health conditions in people living in high pollution areas and compared them to the general population.</p>
      <p>It focused not just on hospital admissions and deaths but also symptoms such as chest infections.</p>
      <p>The study found roadside air pollution stunted lung growth in children by approximately 14% in Oxford, 13% in London, 8% in Birmingham, 5% in Liverpool, 3% in Nottingham and 4% in Southampton.</p>
      <p>Researchers also said if air pollution was cut by a fifth, there would be thousands fewer cases of children with symptoms of bronchitis across those UK cities.</p>

        <b>'Public health crisis'</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Air pollution makes us, and especially our children, sick from cradle to the grave, but is often invisible," said Dr Rob Hughes, senior fellow at the Clean Air Fund.</p>
      <p>"This impressive research makes this public health crisis - which affects people all across the UK - visible, and shows the urgency with which all political parties must prioritise cleaning up our air."</p>
      <p>Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, called on the UK government to legally commit to the World Health Organisation's targets to clean up the country's "dangerous" air.</p>
      <p>WHO's clean air target is for 40 Âµg/m3 - 40 micrograms of annual nitrogen dioxide per cubic metre of air.</p>
      <p>"It seems as if every day we see more and more evidence of the terrible health effects air pollution is having on our lungs," Dr Woods said.</p>
      <p>"It's the most vulnerable that are hit hardest," she added.</p>
      <p>"We know air pollution stunts our children's still-developing lungs and those with a lung condition can find their symptoms are made far worse by poor air quality."</p>
      <p>The group behind the study - a coalition of 15 health and environment NGOs, including the British Lung Foundation - is calling for a national network of Clean Air Zones across the UK.</p>
      <p>Toxic air pollution in central London has reportedly fallen by a third since the introduction of a new traffic charging zone.</p>
      <p>Levels of nitrogen dioxide in the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) dropped by 30% in the first six months of the scheme, according to City Hall.</p>
