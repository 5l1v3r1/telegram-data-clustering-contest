      <p>Ever had sweet plantains, platanos, banana peze, or plantain chips? This sometimes sweet, yet often savory food can be found in a variety of common dishes or as a snack. But many are unfamiliar with how a wide variety of dish styles can be created with plantains. One main reason the fruit is prepared in various ways is due to seasonal patterns that vary globally. However, no matter the season, plantains are often cooked before eaten. So, while you might have tried mofongo, a Puerto Rican dish comprised of fried green plantain mashed with spices and herbs, or maduros, a South American staple of ripened sweet plantain either fried, boiled or baked, imagine trying sweet plantain ice cream, cookies, or brownies!  </p>

      <p>With a fond love for plantains stemming from a life-long cultural familiarity with the fruit, founder Rachel Laryea endeavored to create <a href="https://www.kelewelenyc.com/">Kelewele</a>. Kelewele’s mission is to serve as “a healthy lifestyle brand dedicated to making innovative and culturally inspired plantain dishes.”</p>

        <b>Founding Kelewele </b>

      </figure>
      <p>Kelewele is a lifestyle brand with an emphasis on community, culture, and food, created due to the cultural and culinary curiosity and experiences its founder Laryea stumbled upon after her earliest memories watching her mother cook her favorite Ghanian dish in their U.S. based home for many years. That "dish", called Kelewele, is a popular Ghanaian street food comprised of fried plantains coated in ginger, spices and served with ground nuts. Laryea’s love for plantains and her desire as a New York University (NYU) undergraduate student looking to find ways to save money led her to seek "quick, cheap eats” some nights when she got hungry.  She returned to eating plantains more frequently, began experimenting with the fruit, and it became her go-to ingredient on numerous nights as she transitioned to a vegan diet. Laryea found plantains to be a very nutritionally rich food. </p>

      <p>She then endeavored to spice things up as she increased her intake of the prepared fruit, which led her to experiment with the item in countless dishes. Laryea expresses that creating and taste testing the creations she’d made with friends, family, and colleagues allowed her to discover dishes that many liked. With the prospects of becoming a food entrepreneur appearing intriguing, she ultimately decided that it may be more realistic upon graduation from NYU to pursue a career on Wall Street. Although she pursued this career, she couldn’t stop thinking about Kelewele. And after resigning from her role on Wall Street she ventured to pursue two PhD degrees in African American Studies and Socio-cultural Anthropology at Yale University.</p>
      <p>During this time the idea behind Kelewele became so clear and Laryea realized how special Kelewele was to her given its cultural connection to her Ghanaian heritage, which she had explored through her anthropological graduate school studies. This inspired Laryea to launch Kelewele in NYC to celebrate both Africa and the diaspora through unique yet culturally curated dishes that reinvent how plantains are prepared and eaten. </p>

      <p>Laryea shares that:</p>
      <blockquote>“...the beauty of Kelewele is that it shows the diversity of a diasporic food, celebrates my African roots, and brings people of African, and African diasporic cultures together on the premise of healthy eating, community and culture. This global love for plantains has been inspiring to me as I watch Kelewele connect people from all parts of the world through a shared cultural experience.”</blockquote>

      <p>Since its creation Kelewele has scaled to reach plantain lovers at numerous conferences, events, parties, and more. Some of the company’s most notable appearances include <a href="https://www.curlfest.com/">Curlfest</a>, <a href="https://www.vegandalefest.com/">Vegandale</a>, the <a href="https://www.jamesbeard.org/">James Beard Foundation</a>, and partnerships with <a href="https://www.bet.com/">BET International</a>, The African Folk Art Museum, <a href="https://www.aramark.com/">Aramark</a> and the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/">NYC Mayor’s Office</a>. Additionally, requests for the company have expanded internationally leading Kelewele to take on Ghana this year at Afrochella and other events featured in the country’s Year of Return initiative. With these great opportunities, Laryea is learning and reinventing her dishes as she scales.</p>

      <p>Some of the most popular plantain creations include: sweet plantain based ice cream, made from the company's original plantain milk, brownies, crumble pie, Kelewele itself, and “phishcakes” (a vegan play on fishcakes).</p>
      <p>Although she has enjoyed creating these wonderful dishes and engaging opportunities to bring people together, she describes that her journey growing the company hasn’t always been easy. She has often faced the challenges of juggling school–where she has learned theories that have supported her delving deeper into the culture that has fueled her love for the company she has created–while committing to bringing her dream to fruition. However, this hasn’t slowed her determination to create many amazing dishes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tips for Entrepreneurs &amp; Creating a New Wave for Plantains </b>
      </p>
      <p>Laryea advises aspiring entrepreneurs to: “just go for it.”  She notes that: “no matter how hard it is and no matter how many things you have to juggle to make things work, go for it, and never give up. The thing with passion is that it drives and motivates you. Believe in your vision and strive to make it work.” </p>

      <p>Importantly, one thing she has found crucial for food-based businesses has been leveraging customer insight on the food entrepreneur’s ideas to better understand and approach opportunities for improvement in product taste, presentation and marketing. Mediocre or poor customer feedback is invaluable when aiming to produce the best product offerings possible. She expresses having constantly gone through an iterative creation process with a commitment to constant refinement.</p>
      <p>The creation processes of food artists or creators like Laryea’s have led plantain, a fruit stemming from the banana family in Southeast Asia as early as 3000 BC and traveling to West Africa where the budding company was first enveloped in West African culture and cuisine, to become a re-inventible staple in cuisine as we know it today. And according to the <a href="https://evans.uw.edu/sites/default/files/public/Evans_UW_Request_239_West_Africa_Bananas_and_Plantains_01_08_14_final_0.pdf">Gates Foundation</a>, Ghana is the number one producer of many of the plantains sourced for these fun, creative food inventions globally. </p>
