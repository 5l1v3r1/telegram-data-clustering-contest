      <h1>NewsBreak: Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Jumps as Analyst Predicts Turnaround</h1>

      <p>Investing.com – Shares of home goods retailer Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/bed-bath---beyond-inc">BBBY</a>) jumped more than 6% Monday after a Bank of America/Merrill Lynch analyst said the company's new CEO has the tools to lead a successful turnaround.</p>
      <p>Mark Tritton had been chief merchandising officer at Target (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/target">TGT</a>) before taking the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond job in October. Analyst Curtis Nagle said he believes Tritton, who helped Target on its own turnaround, is the right man to lead Bed Bath &amp; Beyond to a recovery.</p>
      <p>The task will be daunting, Nagle wrote in a note. It will include selling non-core or unprofitable businesses, cost-cutting and store rationalization, selling unneeded real estate and, lastly, improving merchandising, sourcing, and in-store and online operations.</p>
      <p>If the turnaround works, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond could be generating EBITDA of more than $900 million annually by 2021, Nagle said. That would let the company buy back up to $1 billion in shares – about 60% of its current market capitalization.</p>
      <p>Shares reached as high as $13.46 before settling back to $13.45, up 7.4 %. The shares are up 84% since hitting a 52-week low of $7.31 on August 15. For the year, they're up nearly 19%.</p>
