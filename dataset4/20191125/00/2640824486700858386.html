      <p><b>EEMY architecture and design has created a resilient <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/bamboo-architecture-and-design/">bamboo</a> shelter that can withstand severe weather.</b> created in collaboration with the world bank, build academy, <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/airbnb/">airbnb</a> and GFDRR, ‘delta’ can retract into itself when challenged by extreme conditions, much like a turtle retreats inside its shell.</p>

      <p><b>using the <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/architecture-in-the-philippines/">philippines</a> as an example of areas that are prone to natural disasters, <a href="https://eemyoffice.nl/">EEMY</a> was inspired by the strength of traditional filipino bahay-kubo houses.</b> delta’s pyramidal shape enhances earthquake resilience whilst the base is elevated off the ground to withstand high waters. in extreme weather conditions, the shelter can contract to half its size, transforming into a ‘super resilient’ compact pyramid.</p>

      <p><b>the shelter does so through a series of foldable ‘bamboo tents’ that can be expanded or folder back onto the main structure (430 square feet).</b> when expanded to its full size (861 square feet), the triangular windows and ‘wings’ can be used as shade, drying racks, market stalls, and connecting to create covered community courtyards.</p>

      <p><b>the use of bamboo echos the natural feel of traditional filipino bahay-kubo houses.</b> the primary structure is composed of bamboo poles (12cm diameter) with trusses in between for extra stability. the bamboo is also treated with a boron solution, a naturally occurring salt solution that renders the bamboo indigestible to insects.</p>
      <p>
        <b>EEMY says that the design can be constructed within 28 days with owners driving the construction at cost of just $8,500.</b>
