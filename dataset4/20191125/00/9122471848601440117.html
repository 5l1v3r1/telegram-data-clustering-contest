      <h1>Dez Bryant Has Telling Comment On Cowboys-Patriots Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:10:10+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant has weighed in on this evening’s game against the New England Patriots. His comment is probably going to sit well with much of the fan base.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys are trailing the Patriots, 13-9, late in the fourth quarter. It’s been a mistake-filled game for Dallas, which has made <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/jason-garrett-cowboys-undisciplined-performance">some puzzling coaching decisions, too</a>.</p>
      <p>Bryant believes one team has the better players, while the other has the better coaches. You probably don’t need more than one guess here…</p>
      <p>“What I see from the game so far…. Dallas has the better players but New England has the better coaches and game plan,” he tweeted.</p>

      <p>He’s probably not wrong.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys are one of the most-talented teams in the NFL, but Jason Garrett’s team just hasn’t put it together this season. The Patriots, meanwhile, are led by the greatest coach in league history.</p>
      <p>We’ll see if Dallas can flip the script in the game’s final minutes.</p>
      <p>The finish can be seen on FOX.</p>
