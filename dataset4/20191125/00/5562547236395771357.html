      <p><a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/luka-doncic">Luka Doncic</a> is currently playing otherworldly basketball, but realizes that the NBA season is a marathon, not a sprint.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old superstar remains laser-focused on dragging Dallas (11-5) back to the playoffs.</p>

      <p>Per <i><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28157503/red-hot-luka-doncic-keeping-focus-playoff-berth">ESPN</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“For me, it’s making the playoffs still,” said Doncic, who had 41 points, 6 rebounds and 10 assists in the win, more than holding his own in a duel with perennial MVP candidate James Harden (32 points, 9 rebounds, 11 assists). “It’s a long season. It’s only been one month. We didn’t make the playoffs yet, so we’ve just got to keep going right now.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>Doncic lightly clapped his hands above his head and gave the fans two thumbs up to show his appreciation before heading into the tunnel, but he kept an even keel, a theme for the Mavericks after they extended their winning streak to five games with a 137-123 victory over the Houston Rockets on Sunday afternoon.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“We’re not going to get overexcited,” Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said. “We know we’re capable. … The team is growing. This is a big win, there’s no question about that. This is a big-time place to play, and you’re playing against great players, and so our guys deserve credit. But, look, this is a process, and it’s day by day, week by week.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>[Doncic] joined LeBron James as the lone players in NBA history to have multiple outings with at least 40 points and 10 assists before their 21st birthday.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“Luka runs the show,” Mavs power forward Kristaps Porzingis said. “We all depend on him most of the game, and he’s playing incredible right now. He’s getting guys open looks. … He’s playing incredible right now. I’m super happy for him.”</i>
