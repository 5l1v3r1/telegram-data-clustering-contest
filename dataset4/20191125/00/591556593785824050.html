      <p>South Korean telco KT has succeeded in data transfer between its 5G network and a satellite, the company said. <br/><br/>The carrier performed data transfer through its network with the Mugunghwa 6 satellite, run by its affiliate KT SAT, 36,000 kilometres away in space. <br/><br/>KT will also be able to use the satellite as a back-haul when transferring media files to multiple devices simultaneously, and will also allow the carrier to provide more stable 5G services by grouping its network with the satellite. <br/><br/>KT said it has developed a hybrid router for the test, and performed HD streaming from its 5G network and satellite to multiple 5G handsets for the test. <br/><br/>KT SAT operates a total of five satellites, which will allow the carrier to deploy the technology globally. <br/><br/>For instance, automated cars or tractors operating in areas where 5G coverage is unstable or during environmental crisis can link to the satellite to continue operations, wherever they are. <br/><br/>The technology can also assist in delivering wireless coverage in developing nations with weak infrastructure, KT said. <br/><br/>The South Korean telco said it will submit the test results to 3GPP in 2020 to contribute in setting the global standard for satellite-5G technology.  <br/><br/>KT, together with Korean automotive giant Hyundai, is also testing <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/kt-and-hyundai-test-5g-traffic-navigation-on-autonomous-cars/">real-time traffic navigation</a> for autonomous cars using 5G networks. <br/><br/>South Korea <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/south-koreas-5g-goes-live-earlier-than-scheduled-to-claim-worlds-first-title/">commercialised 5G networks in April for consumers</a> and is planning to deploy standalone network services next year.</p>
