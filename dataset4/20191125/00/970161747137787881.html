      <p>Millions of Brits will head out on December 12 and decide who gets to run the country at such a pivotal time in its history.</p>
      <p>With the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> deadline around the corner, and fiery debates on the NHS, education and and taxation raging on, voters across the country will be eager to head to the polls.</p>
      <p>We’re lucky to live in a country where people have this freedom, but there’s a few basic rules to follow when casting your ballot.</p>
      <p>It’s important to make sure your vote actually counts and that you don’t end up breaking the law.</p>
      <p>So here’s a guide to what you should and shouldn’t do at UK polling stations.</p>
      <h3>Taking pictures</h3>

      <p>It isn’t against the law to take a cheeky selfie at a polling station but doing it anywhere near a voting booth is strongly discouraged.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>There’s a risk you could inadvertently reveal how someone else has voted, which could land you with a six month prison sentence or a £5,000 fine.</p>
      <p>It’s illegal to share a picture of a ballot paper under the Section 66 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, including your own.</p>
      <p>Advice from the Electoral Commission says: ‘Due to the potential breach of the law, intentionally or not, we strongly advise against any form of photography taken inside a polling station.</p>
      <p>‘However, if a voter would like to highlight their participation in the elections, we suggest this is done outside the polling station before or after they vote.’</p>

      <p>Bringing your pet as you cast your vote has become a massive trend in recent years.</p>
      <p>Every election our hearts are warmed with social media posts showing our four legged friends witnessing democracy in action.</p>
      <p>But they might be asked to wait outside the station, particularly if it’s busy.</p>
      <p>And they can’t vote themselves. Obviously.</p>
      <h3>Showing up drunk</h3>
      <p>It isn’t against the law to get absolutely steaming before casting your ballot but it isn’t encouraged either.</p>
      <p>Staff can’t turn you away just because it looks like you’ve been drinking but they could ask you to come back when you’ve sobered up if you’re being too rowdy.</p>
      <p>If you’re really disruptive, there’s a chance the police could arrest you for being drunk and disorderly, as they would anywhere.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Even if you aren’t under the influence of alcohol or drugs, don’t be loud or make a nuisance of yourself.</p>
      <h3>Bringing your family</h3>
      <p>It’s fine to bring your children to the polling station but they shouldn’t touch the ballot paper.</p>
      <p>If you have a few young ones with you then staff can keep an eye on them while you cast your vote.</p>
      <p>Bringing you entire extended family could be seen as a bit weird but there’s no rule against it.</p>
      <p>Large groups of any kind could be asked to wait outside if there’s a risk of disturbing voters.</p>
      <h3>Make it clear who you’re voting for</h3>

      <p>It’d be a shame if your vote didn’t count because you’d marked the paper in the wrong way.</p>
      <p>You can put a tick, cross, or colour in the box, but as long as it is clear who you’re voting for and don’t try and chose multiple candidates.</p>
      <p>Don’t sign your name or write anything else on the paper – just stick to the choice in front of you.</p>
      <p>If you make a mistake and accidentally vote for the wrong person, go to the desk and explain what happened to staff, who will be able to cancel your ballot and give you a new one.</p>
      <p>Some people chose to deliberately spoil their ballot to express their frustration with the political system.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Protesters have been known to tick every box, write all of the ballot paper, and, of course, draw a penis on it.</p>
      <p>Just make sure the genitalia isn’t only marked in a single box or you might end up voting for someone you don’t want.</p>
      <h3>Taking your own pens and pencils</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>You may have heard conspiracy theories about votes marked with pencil being rubbed out during the Brexit referendum.</p>
      <p>This would have been a difficult plot to orchestrate and of course it wasn’t true, but that didn’t stop some people standing outside polling stations handing out pens in June 2016.</p>
      <p>It’s completely fine to bring your own pens or pencils, as long as you can clearly indicate you you’re voting for.</p>
      <p>The reason why pencils are provided at polling stations is because ink from a pen can smudge or spill on the paper and risk spoiling a ballot.</p>
      <p>Ink might spread when the ballot is folded making it look like someone has voted more than once.</p>

      <p>Dismissing fraud fears, the Electoral Commission said: ‘The use of pencils does not in itself increase the likelihood of electoral fraud.</p>
      <p>‘Legislation has built specific safeguards into the process, such as the requirement for seals to be attached to ballot boxes at the close of poll.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘By law, campaigners are also entitled to be present at that stage and to attach their own seals if they wish.</p>
      <p>‘At the start of the count, they can then observe those same seals being broken.</p>
      <p>‘Tampering with ballot papers is a serious offence and if anyone has evidence that ballot papers are being tampered with, they should report this to the police.’</p>
      <h3>Bringing a friend into the polling booth</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Voting is seen as a private thing and you should do it on your own if you’re able to.</p>
      <p>If you cannot read the ballot paper or have a disability then a friend or family member may be allowed to help you.</p>
      <p>The Electoral Commission advises staff talk directly to the voter about this rather than the helper.</p>
      <h3>Covering your face</h3>
      <p>Polling station staff will be looking out for people trying to impersonate someone else on the register to vote twice.</p>
      <p>But there’s no specific rule for voters to show their face and they don’t need to bring proof of ID.</p>
      <h3>Swaying voters</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>The secrecy of the ballot box is sacred and should be protected (Picture: AFP/Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Voters aren’t allowed to wear clothing promoting a particular party, like t-shirts with campaign slogans on them.</p>
      <p>Clearly showing your political allegiance could get you turned away from the polling station, as could talking loudly about politics.</p>
      <p>Staff want to make no one is pressured into changing their votes and that everyone feels free to make up their own minds.</p>
      <p>But there are no rules against wearing a party’s colours, so go ahead if that’s how you want to show your support.</p>
      <p>You might see party officials outside the station. They can be there but they have to wear a rosette to make it clear who they are.</p>
      <p>They’re not allowed to act in an intimidating fashion, hang around in large groups or try and hand out literature, so tell a member of staff if they do.</p>
      <h3>Don’t reveal how someone else voted</h3>
      <p>This is probably the most important rule of them all.</p>
      <p>We mentioned this under the rules about taking photos but it’s worth re-iterating.</p>
      <p>Even if you didn’t mean to it could land you in jail or with a hefty fine.</p>
