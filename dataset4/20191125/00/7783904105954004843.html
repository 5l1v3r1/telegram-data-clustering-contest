      <p><b>New Delhi:</b> The Supreme Court on Monday said it will pass its order at 10.30 am on Tuesday on the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress combine’s plea against the Maharashtra governor’s decision to swear in Devendra Fadnavis as chief minister. A bench comprising Justices N V Ramana, Ashok Bhushan and Sanjiv Khanna is likely to pass an order on holding of a floor test. The combine was pressing that the floor test be ordered today itself which was opposed by Fadnavis and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar.</p>
      <p>Kapil Sibal (who is representing the Shiv Sena): To ensure that the Speaker is one who enjoys the confidence of the House, I request you exercise your jurisdiction under A 142 and pass orders. If BJP has majority, why is it worried? I am happy to lose on floor of Maha Assembly.”</p>
      <p>Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the Congress and NCP to SC, sought immediate floor test.</p>
      <p>Mukul Rohatgi for BJP refers to constitutional provisions, says procedures of assembly like pro-tem speaker cannot be interfered with. Parties are seeking direction to governor, who is immune, to act as per their wishes.</p>
