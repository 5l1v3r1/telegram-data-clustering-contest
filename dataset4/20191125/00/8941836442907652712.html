      <p>SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gahan-allen-wilson/">Gahan Wilson</a>, whose humorous and often macabre cartoons were a mainstay in magazines including Playboy, the New Yorker and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-lampoon/">National Lampoon</a>, died last week. He was 89.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gahan-allen-wilson/">Wilson</a>’s stepson, Paul Winters, said he died Nov. 21 in Scottsdale, Arizona, from complications of dementia.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gahan-allen-wilson/">Wilson</a> delighted readers with his haunting scenes and dark humor. One cartoon shows a man reading a doctor’s eye chart with progressively shrinking letters that spell out, “I am an insane eye doctor and I am going to kill you now.” Behind him, a mad scientist gleefully holds a blade, ready to strike.</p>
      <p>In another, two fishermen sit in a boat, unaware the captain behind them is removing a human mask to reveal a fish-like face, a mischievous toothy smile and scaly chest. “How did you come to name your boat the Revenge, Captain?” reads the caption.</p>
      <p>In a story posted on his website, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gahan-allen-wilson/">Wilson</a> recalled how he’d struggled to convince editors that their readers would understand and appreciate his cartoons. His big break came from a fill-in cartoon editor at Colliers who didn’t know the conventional wisdom about his work.</p>

      <p>“Not being a trained cartoon editor, he did not realize my stuff was too much for the common man to comprehend, and he thought it was funny,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gahan-allen-wilson/">Wilson</a> wrote. “I was flabbergasted and delighted when he started to buy it!”</p>
      <p>He went on to reflect on artists who push boundaries and shock the status quo.</p>
      <p>“Art should lead to change in the way we see things,” he wrote. “If some artist comes up with a vision which gives a new opening, it usually creates a lot of stress, because it’s frightening.</p>
      <p>His regular multi-panel strip in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-lampoon/">National Lampoon</a> in the 1970s was called “Nuts,” a take on Charles Schultz’s “Peanuts.”</p>
