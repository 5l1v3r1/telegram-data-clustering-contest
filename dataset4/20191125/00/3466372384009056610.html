      <p>The dichotomy between the regime policy and public opinion is nowhere near as sharp as in the world of diplomacy.</p>
      <p>And nowhere in the contemporary situation is this maxim so sharply visible as in the dalliance of the West Asian oligarchies with Israel.</p>
      <p>The romance began at least a decade ago -- perhaps, more -- but it still remains an illicit affair.</p>
      <p>Israel would have liked an open relationship.</p>
      <p>It has a lot to gain thereby.</p>
      <p>But that's possible only when pigs fly.</p>
      <p>The reason is that the authoritarian rulers of Muslim Middle East are acutely conscious of the so-called 'Arab Street'.</p>
      <p>This may seem a paradox -- that oligarchies need to be mindful of popular opinion -- but, in actuality, they do not enjoy such a big leeway as one imagines to trample upon public opinion to the extent that strong elected leadership would have.</p>
      <p>When they defy or ignore public opinion, it must be for weighty reasons -- mostly, when existential issues are involved such as the regime's survival, for instance.</p>
      <p>Israel doesn't fall into that exceptional category -- it is not as if without a relationship with Israel, the Arab oligarchies would face extinction.</p>
      <p>The dalliance between the Arab regimes and Israel is characterised by pragmatism rather than principles or critical imperatives.</p>
      <p>So long as Israel lacks any 'soft power' in its Arab neighbourhood and the 'Arab Street' views it negatively, the hands of the authoritarian rulers are tied.</p>
      <p>They can go only thus far, and no further.</p>
      <p>In turn, it severely limited the relationship.</p>
      <p>The Indian leadership should realise the limitations of pragmatic external relations in diplomacy.</p>
      <p>There is no gainsaying the fact that India's 'soft power' is depleting at an alarming rate.</p>
      <p>The acolytes of the Modi government do not seem to care and even those amongst the few amongst them who are erudite enough to comprehend the significance of what is happening tend to put on an air of defiance or studied indifference -- or worse still, become polemical.</p>
      <p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's recent remark that Imperial Britain divested India of $44 trillion is a typical remark.</p>
      <p>Faced with the quandary of searing criticism in Britain regarding the J&amp;K situation, he takes a detour to malign Britain.</p>
      <p>How this round figure of $44 trillion has been arrived at is another matter -- even if one doesn't want to get into the modernisation of India under British rule that made the evolution of the Indian State as a political entity possible.</p>
      <p>Today, 'soft power' is no longer in vogue in the Indian diplomatic toolbox.</p>
      <p>The obsession with 'macho' image is so overpowering.</p>
      <p>Under the Modi government, the accent on 'soft power' began with a bang in 2014 and is quite visibly ending after five years with a whimper.</p>
      <p>A number of mistakes have been made during the past 5-year period that dented India's 'soft power' (which one doesn't want to go into there).</p>
      <p>But it is the appalling situation in the Kashmir valley that dealt a body blow to India's image.</p>
      <p>An opinion is steadily gaining ground in the Muslim countries in India's 'extended neighbourhood' that the Modi government is adopting State policies that are decidedly 'anti-Muslim'.</p>
      <p>Even the elites in friendly countries such as Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia or Turkey, who are by no means 'Islamist', tend to see Kashmir as a 'Muslim issue.'</p>
      <p>A recent opinion piece in the influential US magazine <i>Foreign Policy</i> is entitled 'Kashmir Could Wreck India's Reputation Among Afghans'. It is a nuanced analysis -- by no means 'anti-Indian' -- of how Afghan public opinion, which is traditionally friendly, is discernibly getting disenchanted with India's repression of Kashmiri Muslims.</p>
      <p>This is a depressing scenario, because 'soft power' has been historically the bedrock of India-Afghan relations, and for that reason, Delhi under successive governments right from 1947, placed great emphasis on people-to-people relations between the two countries.</p>
      <p>Certainly, our diplomacy will be by far diminished if the Afghans perceive us as no different from Pakistan -- pursuing cold, pitiless geopolitical objectives in their country.</p>
      <p>It is small comfort that Afghans will probably continue to view India as a 'stabilising factor'.</p>
      <p>To quote Hari Prasad, the author of the article, 'The positions of political actors in Afghanistan have ranged from neutral to explicitly pro-India, primarily for India's support for the Afghan government as well as anti-Pakistan animus. But our discussions with journalists and Afghans in the region show the popular reaction is decidedly more nuanced. Many working-class Afghans, drawing from their own experiences of conflict and oppression, identify with Kashmir's Muslims.'</p>
      <p>The analysis makes the foreboding conclusion: 'Afghans are closely watching the actions of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in Kashmir and throughout the region. That should be a reality check for New Delhi; its courting of Afghan opinion can only go so far. India may have the funding and power to shape public opinion and support in Afghanistan, but it will take much more to overcome growing mistrust.'</p>
      <p>If the changing perceptions regarding India are such in Afghanistan, can it be any different in the Central Asian region?</p>
      <p>The people in the steppes are, if anything, far more deeply immersed in Islamic culture, ethos and identity than Afghans, given the historical reality that their region was also the cradle of Islam in its golden era.</p>
      <p>The Uzbeks, for instance, take great pride that Babur set out from Fergana, which, incidentally, has a museum dedicated to Babur.</p>
      <p>One of the most evocative historical monuments in Kabul is the Bagh-e Babur (Garden of Babur), the final resting place that the great emperor chose for himself -- rather than Agra.</p>
      <p>Even if Delhi were to build half a dozen parliament buildings in Kabul, the Afghans will continue to treasure the Bagh-e Babur as the living monument to their abiding links with India.</p>
