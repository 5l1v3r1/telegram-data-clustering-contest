      <p>Former Real Madrid midfielder Christian Karembeu backed Paris Saint-Germain star Kylian Mbappe to join the LaLiga giants.</p>
      <p>Mbappe continues to be heavy linked with a blockbuster switch to Madrid heading into Tuesday's Champions League showdown at the Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>Madrid head coach Zinedine Zidane has made no secret of his admiration for the 20-year-old France international, saying: "I am already in love with him", on the eve of the PSG's trip to the Spanish capital.</p>
      <p>Frenchman Karembeu, who won two Champions League titles during his time at Madrid, tipped compatriot Mbappe to link up with Zidane's side.</p>
      <p>"I think the next star or big move [in La Liga] will be [Kylian] Mbappe," Karembeu said via LaLiga when asked who will be the next French star in Spain. "I surprise you!</p>
      <p>"Ok, we know that there's already [Ferland] Mendy [Madrid], [Ousmane] Dembele [Barcelona, [Karim] Benzema [Madrid]. There are rumours that [Manchester United midfielder Paul] Pogba will come.</p>
      <p>"[Antoine] Griezmann [Barcelona] has shown his skills already. Why not, like I said, Mbappe?"</p>
      <p>Mbappe – a World Cup winner in 2018 – has scored five Ligue 1 goals this season and nine across all competitions for Thomas Tuchel's PSG.</p>
