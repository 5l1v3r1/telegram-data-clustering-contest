      <h1>What slowdown? IIT Madras sees 17% surge in pre-placement offers</h1>
      <h2>Older IITs including the ones at Bombay, Delhi, Kanpur, Kharagpur and Madras are expected to have a better placement season than the others.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">M Saraswathy</a></address>
      <p>Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras saw a 17 percent rise in pre-placement offers (PPOs) ahead of its final placement process this year.</p>
      <p>This, despite the economic slowdown and the institute's own guarded outlook in June, when it said that the offers could be down by 5 percent.</p>
      <p>In a statement, IIT Madras said that 158 students have secured PPOs (as of 22nd Nov 2019) as against 135 during entire 2018-19 academic year. The placement process will begin in December.</p>
      <p>A total of 1,334 students have registered for placements for the academic year 2019-20 at IIT Madras. 170 companies have registered for the first phase of the placement process. They will be recruiting for a total of 322 profiles, including 35 international profiles. As many as 54 startups have also confirmed their presence in the recruitment process.</p>
      <p>PPOs are given to those students who intern with a company in May-June of the previous year. Based on the student’s performance during the internship, the PPO is rolled out.</p>
      <p>Sources said that the older IITs, including the ones at Bombay, Delhi, Kanpur, Kharagpur and Madras, are expected to have a better placement season than the others. Number of offers are expected to go up by 15-20 percent while the compensation may see a 25-30 percent rise.</p>
      <p>"Companies are not talking of any slowdown as far as hiring engineers is concerned. In fact, confirmations by firms on participation in the placement process have come at least a month in advance this year," said an IIT placement official.</p>
      <p>Among companies, technology, software and startups are expected to dominate the campus placement process.</p>
      <p>Manu Santhanam and C S Shankar Ram, Advisors (Training and Placement), IIT Madras, said, "The trend of increasing PPOs through our internship program continues this year. This hopefully is a harbinger of a strong placement season."</p>
