      <p>We're back in from the cold, barren wilderness that is the international break. Club football is back. Let's all take a moment to remember this happy time – and what better way than with the European Player Power Rankings? With <i>SPECIAL GUEST HOST...</i>me.  </p>
      <p>There have been some fantastic performers this week, so we've given them the respect they deserve and used <i>Archer</i> quotes to sum up just how good they were. You know the format. Dig </p>

      <h3>15. Federico Valverde (Down 5)</h3>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>It's not often that Valverde will earn his place in any power rankings, but he has been here twice in a row now. After going 34 senior appearances without scoring, Valverde has two in two games. Enjoy the success.</p>

      <h3>14. Moussa Dembélé (New Entry)</h3>

      <p>Lyon have been sinning in Ligue 1 this year, lost in mid-table obscurity, but Dembélé has four goals in his last four games, so it's not all bad!</p>

      <h3>13. Son Heung-min (New Entry)</h3>

      </p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino is a blimp and José Mourinho is an airplane. Obviously.</p>
      <p>A goal and an assist was a great way for Son to start life under his new boss. If he keeps performing like that, he might not get pushed back to left-back after all.</p>

      <h3>12. Luka Modrić (New Entry)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Freal-madrid-v-real-sociedad-la-liga-santander-5ddbeebb8a147ae30d000003.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8888888888888888&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.04938271604938271&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>

        </i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/real-madrid">​Real Madrid</a> needed Modrić to invent something out of nothing this weekend, as he racked up one goal and two assists in their 3-1 win over Real Sociedad to complete their comeback.</p>

      <h3>11. Emil Forsberg (New Entry)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fzenit-st-petersburg-v-rb-leipzig-group-g-uefa-champions-league-5ddbef61727cd94831000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8888888888888888&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.10256410256410256&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>

        <b>
          <i>Well, not necessarily spaghetti and meatballs, but not necessarily not spaghetti and meatballs either. I mean, man, I really want some spaghetti and meatballs. I mean if I don't get some spaghetti and meatballs I could literally die."</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>​Assists are to Emil Forsberg as spaghetti and meatballs are to Archer. He wants to do more, but it always comes back to the assists.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>10. Timo Werner (Down 5)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Frb-leipzig-v-1-fc-koeln-bundesliga-5ddbf28e8317e20ee5000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8888888888888888&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.1120607787274454&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>​<b><i>"If I worried about a fraction of the stuff I should be worried about, I would never get anything done."</i></b></p>
      <p>Transfer rumours don't phase Werner, who took his tally to six goals and four assists in his last three games with his latest strike against Köln. All the man wants is goals.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>9. Quincy Promes (New Entry)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fchelsea-fc-v-afc-ajax-group-h-uefa-champions-league-5ddbf2f9727cd9354c000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8888888888888888&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.06647673314339982&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>

          <i>"He's been here voluntarily, partying his ass off, as king of the pirates!"</i>
        </b>
        <b>
          <i>​</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Promes' return to the Netherlands has been one long party, and his two goals against Heracles will keep the celebrations rumbling on for a little while longer.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>8. Serge Gnabry (New Entry)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fgermany-v-northern-ireland-uefa-euro-2020-qualifier-5ddbf3538a147a0243000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8954248366013071&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.059312328920172054&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>

        <b>
          <i>"Big whoop. I'm spooning a Barrett .50-cal. I could kill a building."</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Is there anything Gnabry can't do? </p>
      <p>The 24-year-old is on a real tear recently and added another goal and an assist to his tally against Düsseldorf. His perfect league start under Hans-Dieter Flick continues.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>7. Karim Benzema (Up 6)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Freal-madrid-v-real-sociedad-la-liga-santander-5ddbf3798a147a1ac7000003.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8888888888888888&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>​<b><i>“Because I told you to buy lemon curd, Woodhouse. Now what am I going to spread on my toast? Your tears?”</i></b></p>
      <p>Benzema has plenty of doubters, but he will love watching them weep as he continues to score goals at an elite rate.</p>
      <p>One goal and an assist against Sociedad will do just nicely. </p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>6. Lionel Messi (Down 2)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fleganes-v-fc-barcelona-la-liga-santander-5ddbf39c727cd95ec0000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8888888888888888&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.02849002849002849&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>​<b><i>"All moms gave birth to a child. Except mine. She gave birth to a legend."</i></b></p>
      <p>​</p>
      <p>Just the one assist for <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/lionel-messi">​Messi</a> this week, bringing his five-game La Liga scoring streak to an end before it even got going.</p>
      <p>Still, he'll probably go out and net a hat-trick next time.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>5. Jamie Vardy (Up 3)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Ffbl-eng-pr-brighton-leicester-5ddbf3bf8a147a28d2000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.886710239651416&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.03599891998584809&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>

      <p>​<b><i>"Benefits of dating me: You will be dating me."</i></b></p>
      <p>Every manager in the <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier League</a> would want to select Vardy these days. One goal. One assist. Job done.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>4. Gonzalo Higuaín (New Entry)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Ffbl-ita-seriea-atalanta-juventus-5ddbf3df8317e20eaf000002.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8888888888888888&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.05698005698005698&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>

          <i>"Do you want ants? Because that's how you get ants."</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Juventus got themselves into a real mess against Atalanta, but Higuaín was there to tidy things up. Two late goals and one incredibly late assist saw his side pick up a 3-1 win, ensuring their unbeaten start to the season continues.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>3. Hakim Ziyech (Up 4)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fdutch-eredivisie-ajax-amsterdam-v-heracles-almelo-5ddbf3fc727cd95ec0000002.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8888888888888888&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.01899335232668566&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>​<b><i>"I can't hear you over the deafening sound of my own awesomeness."</i></b></p>
      <p>If you've read anything about football in the last 18 months, you'll know that Ziyech is really, really good.</p>
      <p>Another two assists against Heracles took his tally for the season to 17 already, so he's on track to end this season with about 100 to his name.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>2. Robert Lewandowski (Down 1)</h3>

      <h3>1. Ciro Immobile (Up 1)</h3>

      <p>​<i><b>“Something, something, danger zone! I know. I’m not even trying anymore.”</b></i></p>
      <p>Lewandowski's streak may be dead, but Immobile's run of eight league games in a row is very much alive.</p>
      <p>The man scores goals, and it all looks so easy for him.</p>
