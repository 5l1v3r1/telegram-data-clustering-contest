      <p>Winning the AFC Champions League is no longer tough. Al Hilal is the third AFC Champions League champion after beating Urawa Red Devils 3-0 on aggregate. <br/><br/>Al Hilal defeated Urawa Red 2-0 at Saitama Stadium in Japan in the second leg of the AFC Champions League final. <br/><br/>Salim Al Dosari scored the first goal in the 75th minute with a touch of goal after Giovinco's cross, while Gomes added the second goal in injury time. <br/><br/>Razvan Lucescu started the meeting with the presence of Pavitembe Gomes in the attack of Al Hilal, and behind him Sebastian Giovinci. <br/><br/>Al Hilal, taking on clear loopholes, won 2-0 at home to win the AFC Champions League after losing the final two in 2014 to Sydney and the second in 2016 against Urawa itself. <br/><br/>Al Ahly presented an excellent match and beat Urawa back and forth, the first defeat of any Japanese team in the Asian Championship final and qualifying for the Club World Cup.</p>
