        <b>Food Minister Sadhan Chandra Majumder has offered a fresh explanation for the recent hike in rice prices.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He says many prefer fine rice to the coarse varieties now due to their low prices, but it has driven retail prices of the fine varieties slightly.</p>
      <p>Sadhan spoke to reporters after an event organised by the FBCCI in Dhaka on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Prices of fine varieties of rice started to rise at the mills in the beginning of November.</p>
      <p>In Dhaka, prices of medium quality rice rose by 11 percent and premium quality by up to 8 percent in a month, according to the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>Agriculture Minister Abdur Razzaque last Thursday defended the spike in rice prices, and ruled out market manipulation.</p>

      <p>A rise in paddy prices pushed rice prices, which is good for the farmers, he had said.</p>
      <p>A journalist asked Sadhan why rice prices were rising though the government claimed the stock was sufficient.</p>
      <p>“Rice prices haven’t increased. The hike you see is only in the retail market,” the food minister said.</p>
      <p>“People don’t eat coarse rise anymore. They eat fine rice. They have become used to eating fine rice as the prices dropped following a fall in paddy prices,” he offered.</p>
      <p>The minister claimed traders were not buying coarse rice due to a drop in demand.</p>
      <p>“We can’t sell coarse rice at Tk 30 a kg in the market. The dealers don’t want to buy it because they can’t find customers,” said Sadhan, whose family is involved in rice business in Naogaon.</p>
