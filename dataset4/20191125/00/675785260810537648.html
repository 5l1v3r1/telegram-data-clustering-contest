      <p>An naked Australian tourist who drove a scooter into a swimming pool in Bali with a pal insists they "were not disrespecting locals".</p>
      <p>The driver, known only as Raymond RB, 23, posted a video of the bizarre stunt on his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> page, followed by a second which showed the scooter being hauled out of the pool.</p>
      <p>When the video, which is going viral, was shared to the Bell Tower Times <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> page, it received more than 2,400 comments, with many Balinese complaining that the pair had been disrespectful.</p>
      <p>Explaining his actions to 9News, he said: "My reason for doing it was an alcohol-influenced situation."</p>
      <p>He dismissed claims there would be public outrage over his behaviour.</p>
      <p>Raymond also insisted he owns the scooter because he spends four months in Bali every year.</p>

      <p>He said: "I'm not too bothered by people saying I'm immature.</p>
      <p>"I just don't want people thinking it's a rental scooterâ€¦ (that) I'm disrespecting the locals."</p>
      <p>Indonesians led the chorus of disgust expressed on social media.</p>
      <p>One said: "Please...have some respect."</p>

      <p>Another moaned: "Aussies who behave like this are just bringing shame and negative image to Oz, and an eyesore too.</p>
      <p>A woman wrote: "We as Balinese people really respect every tourist come to visit our island, but sometimes we aren't respected cause this reason. Oh my."</p>
      <p>Another person added: "And people wonder why Aussies aren't liked in Bali."</p>
