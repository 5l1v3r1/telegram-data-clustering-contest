      <h1>Watch a Cybertruck Pull a Helpless Ford F-150 Up a Hill</h1>

      <h3>Tow to Tow</h3>
      <p>Last week, Tesla <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/tesla-elon-musk-unveils-blade-runner-cybertruck">announced</a> its long-awaited “Cybertruck” at an event in Los Angeles. While the truck drew some <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/reactions-tesla-cybertruck">ridicule</a> on the internet for its unusual shape and <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-excuse-smashing-cybertruck-window">glitchy reveal</a>, the vehicle does pack some serious power.</p>
      <p>Maybe you have to see it to believe it: In a video Tweeted Sunday by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a Cybertruck can be seen effortlessly pulling a tethered Ford F-150 pickup uphill as it tries to escape.</p>
      <p>It’s an impressive feat that’s bound to raise some eyebrows, especially considering the fact that Ford’s F-Series have been America’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ford-f-series-f150-truck-sales-record-history-2017-1">best selling trucks</a> for <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/25771/ford-f-series-is-americas-best-selling-truck-for-42nd-straight-year">42 years</a>.</p>

      <h3>Spin Out</h3>
      <p>The tires on the F-150 spins out almost immediately, succumbing to the electric pickup’s raw power — or superior traction. It’s unclear what kind of tires were used in the test.</p>
      <p>That’s more or less in line with the advertised towing capacities of each truck. The Cybertruck will be able to tow more than 14,000 pounds according to Tesla. A top-of-the-line 2020 F-150 can tow only up to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-cybertruck-ford-f-150-compared-specs-photos-2019-11#the-cybertruck-has-a-higher-maximum-payload-2">13,200</a>.</p>
