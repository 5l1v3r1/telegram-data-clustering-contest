        <b>Protoplanetary disks around stars may not be the only site for planet formation in the Universe, according to a team of theoretical astrophysicists from Japan. The researchers propose a new site of planet formation: a dusty torus around supermassive black holes in <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/A/Active+Galactic+Nuclei">active galactic nuclei</a>.</b>

      <p>Supermassive black holes, millions to billions of times the mass of our Sun, are found at the centers of galaxies.</p>
      <p>Many of these enormous objects are hidden within a doughnut-shaped cloud of dust and gas known as a torus.</p>
      <p>“A torus can contain as much as a hundred thousand times the mass of the Sun worth of dust. This is a billion times the dust mass of a protoplanetary disk,” said Professor Eiichiro Kokubo from the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan and colleagues.</p>
      <p>“In a low temperature region of a protoplanetary disk, dust grains with ice mantles stick together and evolve into fluffy aggregates.”</p>
      <p>“A dust disk around a black hole is so dense that the intense radiation from the central region is blocked and low-temperature regions are formed.”</p>
      <p>The astrophysicists investigated a growth path from small icy dust particles to Earth-sized planetary bodies in such low-temperature regions, located several light-years from supermassive black holes in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.</p>
      <p>“Our calculations show that tens of thousands of planets with 10 times the mass of the Earth could be formed around 10 light-years from a black hole,” Professor Kokubo said.</p>
      <p>“Around black holes there might exist planetary systems of astonishing scale.”</p>
      <p>“With the right conditions, planets could be formed even in harsh environments, such as around a black hole,” said Professor Keiichi Wada, from Kagoshima, Ehime and Hokkaido Universities.</p>
      <p>The team’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06748">paper</a> will be published in the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0004-637X"><i>Astrophysical Journal</i></a>.</p>
