      <p>The raging issue of nepotism in the governments of both political divides doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon. Asantehene Otumfuo Osei Tutu II wading into the discussion indicated that the “family and friends’ government” has stemmed from the rewarding of supporters who aided presidential candidates during their campaigns.</p>
      <p>He explained that the phenomenon entraps them making Presidents victims of the system of nepotism.</p>
      <p>Otumfuo was of the notion that, heads of states of Ghana have over the years been ensnared in a position that compels them to return the favour by rewarding their supporters with government positions. Successive presidents have been tagged with appointing their family members into key government positions.</p>
      <p>‘Our Presidents themselves have become victims of the system, entrapped in a prison from which they are obliged to dole out largesse to the army of supporters on pain of losing their loyalty,” Otumfuo added.</p>
      <p>The National Communications Officer of the NDC, Sammy Gyamfi speaking at the party’s press conference earlier this month, presented 51 names of persons in office who they claimed are relatives of the sitting president, Nana Akufo-Addo. He describes the president as the "most nepotistic President in the world". The New Patriotic Party however, discredited the claims stating that, “family and friends’ government” originated from the NDC.</p>
      <p>Addressing the audiences at the 3rd Annual University of Professional Studies Accra (UPSA) leadership lecture series in Accra, Asantehene Otumfuo Osei Tutu II charged politicians to execute their duties to the nations and desist from amassing wealth while in office. He called for a change in attitude of public service personnel.</p>
      <p>“Men and women should not enter politics not because it will make them wealthy, but because it will make them worthy to serve their fellow man,” he advised.</p>
      <p>President Akufo Addo while seeking power in 2016 assured Ghanaians that he was not going to operate a family and friends’ government. Contrary to this however, the incumbent administration has been accused of filling key government positions with relatives of the president.</p>
      <p>Asantehene further stated that, “I have no doubt that any President will prefer to be liberated from this entanglement so they can devote all attention to the pursuit of good of all.”</p>
      <p>Otumfuo called for a drastic change in attitude of politicians adding that their first obligation is to serve the people of the nation. He said, “politics should be the path to service and not the gravy train to personal wealth.”</p>
