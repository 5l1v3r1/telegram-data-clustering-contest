      <h1>Dominant Southern performance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.odt.co.nz/author/Jeff%20Cheshire" target="_blank">Jeff Cheshire</a></address>
      <p>Two goals came early.</p>
      <p>The other two came late.</p>
      <p>And the bits in the middle were no less dominant.</p>
      <p>Southern United delivered an emphatic display to notch a 4-0 victory over Hamilton Wanderers at Logan Park Turf on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Its attack was lethal, regularly creating chances and forcing the Hamilton defence to scramble.</p>
      <p>But more importantly, its defence was rock-solid a week after conceding four goals.</p>
      <p>Only with an 83rd-minute penalty — well saved by Liam Little — did the visiting side create a genuine chance.</p>
      <p>The performance left Southern head coach Paul O'Reilly thrilled.</p>
      <p>He felt it had been a comprehensive performance in which the team dominated all over.</p>
      <p>The defensive effort had been "massively pleasing" last week’s effort.</p>
      <p>"Other than the penalty and perhaps one chance from a cross, they didn't threaten our goal at all," he said.</p>
      <p>"We've been renowned as a team that's hard to play against and probably lost a bit of that the week before.</p>
      <p>"We became a little bit poor in some of those gaps we don't normally have.</p>
      <p>"So defensively, very, very good.</p>
      <p>"So delighted with the nil, but I thought it was comprehensive.</p>
      <p>"It could have been three or four ahead of what it was."</p>
      <p>It took just one minute for Abdulla Al-Kalisy to score the first of his two goals.</p>
      <p>A mix-up left keeper Matt Oliver's clearance to deflect directly off defender Blake Weston.</p>
      <p>That left the chasing Al-Kalisy to finish on a wide open goal.</p>
      <p>Captain Conor O'Keeffe doubled the lead 10 minutes later.</p>
      <p>He poked home his first goal for Southern, as the Hamilton defence seemingly stopped thinking he was offside.</p>
      <p>The referees consulted and awarded the goal, as frustration began to spill over among the Hamilton players.</p>
      <p>Southern continued to attack dangerously and went close on several more occasions.</p>
      <p>Joel Stevens was a constant threat with the ball at his feet, while Al-Kalisy and Garbhan Coughlan were both dangerous as well.</p>
      <p>Defensively Southern remained solid, quelling the threats of Hamilton's dynamic duo Tommy Semmy and Derek Tieku.</p>
      <p>The second half followed a similar pattern.</p>
      <p>Southern dropped a little deeper, but continued to threaten and Al-Kalisy went close from long range.</p>
      <p>It took Hamilton until the final 15 minutes to begin to threaten and eventually it won a penalty.</p>
      <p>However, Little came up with a fantastic save to keep the two-goal buffer.</p>
      <p>Al-Kalisy put the result beyond doubt with his second late in the game.</p>
      <p>Stevens followed with one of his own, a lovely run followed by a 40m screamer which rattled in off the left post.</p>
      <p>O'Reilly said it was a great response and a much-needed win following two losses.</p>
      <p>"Massive three points. Like I said, it’s going to be a very tight league and our approach will be taking it week by week.</p>
      <p>"Two poor results, although they were close enough games at times — the boys have dusted themselves off and all the credit goes to the players.</p>
      <p>"We could have felt sorry for ourselves today, but I thought it was a smashing bounce-back performance, and I thought it was comprehensive."</p>
