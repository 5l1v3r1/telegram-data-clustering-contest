      <h1>Texas leaves state AGs antitrust suit vs T-Mobile-Sprint</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">TALI ARBEL</a></address>
      <p>The coalition of state attorneys general suing to stop the merger of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sprint/">Sprint</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a> has lost another state, Texas, two weeks before trial is scheduled to begin.</p>
      <p>Texas said Monday that it has made its own settlement with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a>.</p>
      <p>The state attorneys general go to trial Dec. 9, arguing that the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a>-<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sprint/">Sprint</a> deal will raise prices and be bad for competition. Mississippi and Colorado left the coalition in October, but 14 states and the District of Columbia remain.</p>
      <p>Texas says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a> won’t raise wireless prices in the state for five years and that it will build a next-generation 5G network in Texas.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a> has already promised a national 5G network and to keep prices steady for three years to federal regulators. They have approved the deal.</p>
