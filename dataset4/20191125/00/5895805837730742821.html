      <p>Here is a Thanksgiving dinner problem we are all way too familiar with: your aunt is a staunch Republican. Your husband’s uncle is a die-hard Democrat. What do you do?</p>
      <p>There are three options: You could try to convince the auntie to change allegiance. You could do the same with your husband’s uncle. But the simplest and most straightforward option is to just seat them at opposite ends of the table. I said that there are three options, but the first two aren't really feasible. so what you need to do is to come up with the right seating plan.</p>
      <p>And the same goes for the human mind. A tempting way of thinking about the architecture of the mind would be to imagine it as one large container. Like a fish tank. Perception is providing the input, and action would be the output, but what’s in between is just one large fish tank with no internal structure whatsoever, where information can flow freely from one end of the mind to another.</p>
      <p>As it turns out, this fish tank picture of the human mind is wrong. A somewhat trivial example is double-booking. You knew that December 14 is your sister’s birthday and you knew that there would be a surprise party that night. But you also just made plans with your friend to go to the movies that same night. You will eventually notice that you have double-booked, but until then these two pieces of information seem to live in very different and distant parts of your mind, with no communication between them.</p>
      <p>How can we explain this kind of behaviour if we hold onto the fish tank picture? If the whole mind is just one unified container, then I should not have two contradicting beliefs in this fish tank. But if our mind is fragmented, we can explain all this elegantly. Your sister’s birthday is in one fragment and the movie plans are in another very different fragment. You sometimes use one fragment, sometimes the other. It’s not that we are stupid. It’s that <a href="https://iai.tv/video/the-fractured-mind?access=ALL">our mind is fragmented</a>.</p>
      <p>Double-booking can be annoying, of course, but normally nobody gets hurt. But often fragmentation is a response by what could be called our psychological immune system. If you receive some information that contradicts your <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/identity">self-image</a>, you tend to exile it to a far away fragment of your mind.</p>
      <p>We all think that we are better than average at pretty much anything. 93% of drivers think that we are better than average at driving. That is, 43% of us are <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/delusional-disorder">delusional</a>. And it is not just driving. More than 90% of university professors think that their teaching is better than average. But reality eventually bites and then what do we do? We can't ignore the inconvenient truth about ourselves, but we can try to keep it apart from our self-image.</p>
      <p>And this is where the analogy with the Thanksgiving dinner gets more than just a colorful season-appropriate illustration. When you know that your aunt and your husband's uncle needs to be kept at different ends of the table, this doesn't make for a relaxed time for you. It's pretty <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stressful</a> to always keep track of where they are. Similarly, it is not enough to exile inconvenient information about yourself to faraway fragments in your mind. You also need to make sure it stays there.</p>
      <p>This can be remarkably stressful. Maybe not as stressful as make sure that nobody brings up the impeachment hearings during dinner, but pretty stressful nonetheless. And while the Thanksgiving dinner only lasts for a couple of hours, you need to maintain the fragmentation of your mind 24/7. A fragmented mind—just like most Thanksgiving dinners—has serious psychological repercussions.</p>

      <p>No need to spend your precious time on seating charts. Post a sign at the front door that there is to be no political talk during dinner. That will fix the issue no monitoring required. It works in all kinds of settings to include military wardrooms where certain subject are not allowed to be discussed among the officers when they are dining. It can work in families too.</p>
      <p>Doublebooking: that can be fixed by keeping a schedule and penciling in appointments. No need to worry if you aren't connecting the dots between the two events. Everyone deals with fragmentation - successful people know how to work around it.</p>
