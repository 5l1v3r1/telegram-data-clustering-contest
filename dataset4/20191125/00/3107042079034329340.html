      <p>A million-dollar fighting fund to lure visitors to Christchurch in the off-season is under way.</p>
      <p>Boyd Warren from the promotional agency ChristchurchNZ said hotels and tourist attractions are very busy over the summer, but business falls off during the rest of the year.</p>
      <p>He said tourism groups are banding together to solve the problem and are targeting people aged 40 and under, especially from Auckland and Wellington.</p>

      <p>"If we can make the city cool to under 40s, it will be cool to most people including older people, you know when you've got limited resources it's best to be as focused as you can with your activity."</p>
      <p>Mr Warren said Christchurch is a great place to visit, because it has a vibrant arts scene and a beautiful natural environment.</p>
      <p>"Great value for money when it comes to accommodation and probably some attractions too ... we've definitely got four beautiful seasons, all the flowers are out in the botanic gardens, there's cup and show week, cricket, rugby league."</p>
