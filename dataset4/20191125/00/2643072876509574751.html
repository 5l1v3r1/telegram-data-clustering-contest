      <h1>Facebook, Instagram Set To Ban Sexually Explicit Contents From Its Platform</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Gbenga Sijuade</a></address>
      <p>Social media platforms, Facebook and Instagram have announced new measures as regards sexually explicit contents by users.</p>
      <p>The owner of both online platforms, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/04/14/zuckerbergs-facebook-instagram-and-whatsapp-down-same-time/"><u><b>Mark Zuckerberg</b></u></a>, has promised to block under-18s from viewing sexual content from as January next year.</p>
      <p>The social networks plan to ‘age-gate’ several types of<a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2018/03/16/jennifer-lopez-recalls-sexual-harassment-early-in-her-career/"><u><b> sexually explicit content</b></u></a> for users across the globe from the beginning of 2020.</p>
      <p>Teenagers under the age of 18 will be banned from viewing sexualised adverts, fictional depictions of sex and artistic portrayals of nudity or sex acts, among others, the Daily Telegraph reports.</p>
      <p>But the restrictions, which are due to come in on both platforms, will rely solely on teenagers inputting their own ages, making it easy for them to lie and view inappropriate content anyway.<br/>But with more than 60,000 UK Facebook users under the age of 12 when the age restriction is 13, they could prove fruitless.</p>
      <p>The new rules concern certain types of sexual content, but do not apply to overtly explicit content, which is already widely banned.</p>
      <p>How does Facebook verify your age?<br/>Facebook has a minimum age requirement of 13 for anyone to have an account.</p>
      <p>When creating an account, users are asked to input basic personal information, including age, location, and email address.</p>
      <p>There is currently no way for Facebook to prove an underage user has created a profile with a fake age, although parents, guardians or other responsible adults can report an underage profile.</p>
      <p>It does not apply to ‘explicitly educational’ sexual images and video or to naked images intended for breastfeeding mothers or cancer survivors.</p>
