      <h1>Meze 99 Classic headphones offer strong audio with a hipster appeal</h1>

        <b>What can you expect from a pair of luxury headphones retailing for over $300? If you're looking for features, wireless, microphone support, and software, then these are not for you. If you want headphones that focus on nothing more than utmost comfort and superior audio quality, then the Meze 99 should be on your Holiday shopping list.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Look past the usual gaming headsets and you'll have a wide selection of luxury headphones to choose from. They may not have the "gamer-y" looks, controls, or software features that often come with high-end models targeting gamers, but they make up for this by focusing almost solely on comfort and audio quality.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://mezeaudio.com/products/meze-99-classics-walnut-gold-wood-headphones">Meze 99 Classic</a> is one such pair. These luxurious cans are as barebones as they come with very little in the way of features or buttons, but they offer a stronger audio experience relative to how light they are in weight. When compared to the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Turtle-Beach-Elite-Atlas-Aero-wireless-headphones-are-super-comfy-and-big-on-macro-features.435713.0.html">Turtle Beach Elite Atlas Aero</a>, the streamlined Meze is not nearly as bulky (260 g vs. 397 g) and it's thus much less likely to slide around your head when turning in different directions. It's also arguably more versatile with its many included accessories and adapters as shown below.</p>
      <p>There are a few drawbacks to keep in mind. As light as they may be, the headphones are not collapsible and so they can be difficult to carry around in bags or purses. The included carrying case helps, but it's definitely not a space saver. Secondly, the cushioning on each earpiece is much smaller than on the aforementioned Turtle Beach meaning that outside noise will not be blocked all that well. The flip side is that the cushions are not as tight and so they are easier to wear for users with glasses. And lastly, the ear cushions themselves cannot be easily removed meaning that you'll have to replace the entire headset once the cushions inevitably wear out from use.</p>
      <p>The Meze 99 Classics is currently shipping for $309 in Gold or Silver color options.</p>
