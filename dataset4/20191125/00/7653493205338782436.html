      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/elliott-nash/" target="_blank">Elliot Nash</a></address>
      <p>Finally, the Rock Edition JBL Under Armour Train On-Ear Wireless Bluetooth Sport Headphones has come back to JB Hi-Fi.</p>
      <p>Like the return of the most electrifying man in all of sports entertainment, <a href="https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/jbl-under-armour-train-on-ear-wireless-bluetooth-sport-headphones-rock-edition"><u>the Rock Edition JBL Under Armour Train On-Ear Wireless Bluetooth Sport Headphones</u></a> has arrived at JB Hi-Fi for $399, with the new black variants arriving for the first time in Australia.</p>
      <p>The UA Sport Wireless Train brings two of Under Armour’s unique fabric technologies with an IPX4 rating to the mix for comfort and better resistance in the gym, the actor’s studio or inside the squared circle.</p>
      <p>It comes as JBL is readying it’s Under Armour Project Rock True Wireless Earbuds to be shipped by 28 January 2020, though they won’t be coming to Australia until March 2020.</p>

      <p>The 16-hour speed charge battery will keep you going throughout the 60-minute Iron Man match, with one hour of playback in just 5 minutes of charge.</p>
      <p>Just like the power of Dusty Rhodes’ Bionic Elbow, JBL has included ‘Bionic Hearing with TalkThru Technology’ to reduce the volume and switch on speech-optimized, noise-cancelling mics for conversations between sets, or when you need to call the next spot of the match.</p>
      <p>And just like the Rock’s size-14 boot, the oversized controls provide durability and easy access to play/pause and volume.</p>
      <p>When it comes to packing it all up, the rugged metal hinges fold the earcups into the headband for secure storage inside the moulded hard case.</p>
      <p>So if you smell, or rather hear, what the Rock Edition JBL Under Armour Train On-Ear Wireless Bluetooth Sport Headphones is cooking, then you better head to JB Hi-Fi to pick up your pair now.</p>
