      <p>LIVINGSTON, N.J. (AP) - A New Jersey school district has delayed opening after its computer system was infected with ransomware.</p>
      <p>In a statement to parents, Livingston School Superintendent <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/matthew-block/">Matthew Block</a> says all schools will open two hours later on Monday and a meeting will take place on Monday night to answer questions.</p>
      <p>Block says the district’s servers went down Friday and an outside security company determined they were compromised in an attack that encrypted the district’s data, making it inaccessible.</p>
      <p>Block says it could take weeks to resolve and the district is taking steps to get access back. He did not say if the district would pay the ransom.</p>

        <p>Police are investigating and Block says officials are confident the attack is not associated with anyone in the township.</p>
