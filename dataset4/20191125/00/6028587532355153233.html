      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Felicity Carter</a></address>
      <p>Contemporary artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dan.alva/">Dan Alva</a> takes the classics and reinvents for a modern day audience. He re-masters the masters if you will, and undoubtedly, it’s alluring work.His bold and unapologetic pieces stand proud, they’re incredibly intricate, they’re meticulous and he combines his figurative visual language with bursts of camouflage and stripes, taking in a contemporary direction. And excitingly, his latest body of work, entitled <i>The Outsourced Series </i>will be on show at Art Basel with the Oliver Cole Gallery this year. We talk to the artist to find out what we can expect from Basel 2019.</p>

        <b>Felicity Carter: What was your first memory of art?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dan Alva: I’ve been around art, in one way or another, since childhood. From working in the garage with my old man to picking up my first film camera, I’ve always created something. The garage was my bootcamp to what is now my studio practice. I can build and repair almost anything – but I don’t mess with electricity.</p>

        <b>FC: Tell us more about this latest group of works titled <i>The Outsourced Series</i>?</b>
      </p>
      <p>DA: <i>The Outsourced Series</i> is a modern reinterpretation of old master paintings using original oil paint and methods. The series has become my very own MFA in Art History. It’s been in the works and under research for about three years, but this last year I really kicked it off. Aside from the painting itself, my favorite part has been these forced collaborations between dead masters that never would have happened back in those days. For example, <i>Sleeping with the Fishes</i> has Da Vinci, Rembrandt and Van Gogh all in one.</p>

        <b>FC: How has your work evolved?</b>
      </p>
      <p>DA: I have always looked up to artists like Dan Colen and Damian Hirst that create a series of works, and then move on to the next concept. I go through phases, and I’m still searching for my "style," but <i>The Outsourced Series </i>has been my favorite thus far. It's a labor of love and, as I mentioned before, it's a thesis of sorts.</p>

        <b>FC: Where do you find your inspiration?</b>
      </p>
      <p>DA: I don’t watch TV, I don’t watch movies, I really don’t even read much – but I absorb visuals. Online or in books, I just download images to my brain. Instagram has become a slight addiction because you can scroll forever. It’s a curated google search in my pocket. I once flew from Madrid to Miami and scrolled the entire 8 hours.</p>

        <b>FC: Tell us about the process...</b>
      </p>
      <p>DA: My process in the studio is similar to any ad campaign I have ever worked on. Before even starting a series, I concept, sketch, create mockups, research the history, create, test and even think about how the works will be photographed. I need to visualize every step of the process before actually starting the process.  </p>

        <b>FC: Explain the naming concept and patterns used throughout the series. </b>
      </p>
      <p>DA: I’ve always seen these original works in thick, gold frames in either a museum or palace. I love the over the top frame job these masterworks are usually encased in - they remind me of gaudy mafia homes. I thought it only made sense to title the paintings after popular mafia phrases and slang terms. Most of my series are labeled with code words, and this one is no different. The camouflage pattern has been a recurring style I’ve used for the last 8 years or so. It creates a window-like effect that each artist can appear and disappear in and out of.  </p>

        <b>FC: What’s left for the remainder of the year?</b>
      </p>
      <p>DA: <i>The Outsourced Series </i>will be featured in this year's Art Basel for the very first time at CONTEXT with Oliver Cole Gallery. Besides my framer and a few confidantes, the works haven’t been seen by anyone. I’m looking forward to getting them out in the public eye and hearing the feedback.</p>
