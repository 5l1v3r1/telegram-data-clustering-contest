      <h1>Co Kildare people with asthma warned of triggers this Christmas season</h1>
      <h2>Christmas decorations, food, and cold weather are main triggers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Kim O'Leary</a></address>
      <p>As the festive season kicks in, the Asthma Society is warning the 16,194 people with asthma in Kildare to be aware of their asthma triggers and to plan ahead for the Christmas holidays.</p>
      <p>Sarah O’Connor, CEO of the Asthma Society, said: “This time of year can be extremely dangerous for people with asthma. During the festive season, people don’t take their asthma as seriously as they would throughout the rest of the year. One person dies every six days due to their asthma and 90% of these deaths are preventable.</p>
      <p>"It is so important that people with asthma plan ahead for the holiday season, ensuring that they or their child have enough medication to last the Christmas, as pharmacies will be closed.  It is also essential that they stick to their asthma routine and remember to take their asthma medication daily.  Asthma triggers also need to be taken seriously during the holidays and avoided where necessary. Our “12 Days of Asthma” campaign helps patients by compiling a list of the most common Christmas asthma triggers and some measures to combat them.”</p>
