      <p>Asian shares made guarded gains on Monday as investors braced for another week of likely conflicting commentary on the Sino-US trade dispute, while the outperformance of recent US economic data gave the dollar a leg up on its peers.</p>
      <p>MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan bounced 0.26%, after losing 0.4% last week.</p>
      <p>Japan’s Nikkei firmed 0.8% in early trade, while Australian stocks rose 0.5%. E-Mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 added 0.2%.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, U.S. national security adviser Robert O’Brien said an initial trade agreement with China is still possible by the end of the year, but warned Washington would not turn a blind eye to what happens in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>The comments add to worries that a Chinese crackdown on anti-government protests in Hong Kong could further complicate the talks.</p>
      <p>Over the weekend, pro-democracy candidates in Hong Kong romped to a landslide and symbolic majority in district council elections in the embattled city.</p>
      <p>“Markets are showing some signs of tiring of the steady drip feed of upbeat comments from U.S. officials and no signs of a final agreement looking likely,” said Robert Rennie, head of financial market strategy at Westpac.</p>
      <p>He noted six weeks had passed since the “phase-one” deal was agreed in principle yet there was still no deal in place.</p>
      <p>“Key for markets will thus be whether the Dec. 15 tariffs covering approximately $156 billion of largely technology imports are postponed and whether a deal can be signed ahead of that date, with press suggesting that these tariffs will be delayed to give negotiators more time.”</p>
      <p>Reuters reported an ambitious “phase two” trade deal was also looking less likely, according to U.S. and Beijing officials, lawmakers and trade experts.</p>
      <p>‘LEAST DIRTY’</p>
      <p>In currency markets, the dollar had rallied on Friday when U.S. manufacturing surveys beat forecasts, just as European Union numbers disappointed.</p>
      <p>“U.S. economic data outperformed, highlighting again the resilience of the economy and that while global growth has slowed, it remains the least dirty t-shirt in the laundry basket,” said Tapas Strickland, a director of economics and markets at National Australia Bank.</p>
      <p>“For the EU data, the important takeaway was the ongoing decline in the manufacturing sector is now spreading to the larger services sector, a worrying sign for the global economy.”</p>
      <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Friday called on euro zone governments to strengthen domestic demand after a global trade war brought a decade of export-driven growth to an abrupt end.</p>
      <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks later on Monday and is expected to underline the steady outlook for rates given the better economic figures.</p>
      <p>The euro was off at $1.1021 on Monday, having breached chart support at $1.1040, while the dollar edged up to 108.72 yen.</p>
      <p>The dollar was steady on a basket of currencies at 98.258, after gaining 0.3% last week.</p>
