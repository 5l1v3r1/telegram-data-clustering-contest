      <p>The funding was led by Salesforce Ventures with additional funding from existing investors, including Softbank Investment Advisers and Goldman Sachs.</p>
      <p>Automation Anywhere plans to use the new funding to “accelerate its vision to empower customers to automate end-to-end business processes”.</p>
      <p>It will also be used to “advance the company’s focus on improving human-to-bot collaboration through attended automation”, which it hopes will result in “enhanced customer experiences and increased employee productivity”.</p>

      <p>SoftBank-sponsored Automation Anywhere raised $550 million in a Series A fund in 2018, featuring General Atlantic, Goldman Sachs, NEA, World Innovation Lab, and Workday Ventures.</p>
      <p>“Never before has there been such a transformative shift in the way we work, with artificially intelligent software bots changing how people, processes and technology interact for productivity gains,” says Mihir Shukla, CEO and co-founder of Automation Anywhere.</p>
      <p>“This new funding reinforces the promise of the RPA category and empowers our customers to achieve greater business agility and increased efficiencies by automating end-to-end business processes – bridging the gap between the front and back office.”</p>
