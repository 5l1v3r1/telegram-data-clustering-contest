        <b>Ciara was feeling a little blue at the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/american-music-awards/">American Music Awards</a> 2019 but she was by no means sad, shining bright in an electric suit.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Melanin singer quite literally made her melanin pop as she graced the AMAs red carpet at the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles on Sunday night, and it’s safe to stay she commanded attention.</p>
      <p>Kitted out in Balmain everything, Ciara rocked the red carpet with a blue pin-striped blazer jacket, which she left open to reveal her chunky jewellery, teamed with a pair of darker blue flared pants.</p>
      <p>And it was a whole look.</p>
      <p>It’s set to be a big night for CiCi, 34, who will be hosting the star-studded music awards for the first time.</p>
      <p>While speaking to the AMAs red carpet hosts Lauren Jaraugei and AJ Gibson, Ciara opened up about her new single Melanin, which sees her celebrate her rich skin colour with the likes of Lupita Nyong’o, Lala Anthony and the City Girls.</p>

      <p>‘It makes me so happy to see that engagement with all the girls around the world. That’s what that song is about,’ Ciara said.</p>

      <p>The R&amp;B singer had previously said in a statement: ‘This is ultimately an anthem of self-love, which is a journey I’ve been on since my Beauty Marks album.</p>
      <p>‘It celebrates the beautiful shades of culture that comprise the inner and outer beauty of everyone. Embracing the unique nature of our skin tones threads together the tapestry of humankind.’</p>
      <p>The Melanin music video is expected to arrive soon and you can bet it’ll be a hit.</p>
      <p>Post Malone is leading the way with seven AMAs nominations, while the night will see performances from the likes of Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, The Jonas Brothers, Camila Cabello and Kesha.</p>
