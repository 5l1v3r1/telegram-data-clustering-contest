      <p> Prosecutors have dropped pimping suspicions against Yang Hyun-suk, an entertainment guru, officially ending the investigation into the case, industry sources said Monday.</p>
      <p>The Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office’s division dealing with crimes against women and children closed the case on Sept. 30, clearing the 50-year-old founder and former chief of YG Entertainment of the suspicions.</p>
      <p>YG, home for big-name K-pop bands, including BIGBANG and BLACKPINK, is one of the three biggest K-pop production companies in South Korea.</p>
      <p>Yang had been under investigation over media-reported allegations that he procured sex services for two potential investors from abroad in 2014.</p>
      <p>Prior to the prosecution decision, the police looked into mobile communication records and financial transaction data of Yang and interrogated a woman who was suspected of recruiting prostitutes for him.</p>
      <p>The police did find that a foreign investor in the case had sexual relations with a prostitute but concluded it was not suggested or paid for by Yang.</p>
      <p>The conclusion was then forwarded to prosecutors on Sept. 20 and prosecutors upheld it the same month.</p>
      <p>Yang is still facing separate suspicions of illegal overseas gambling and illegal foreign currency transactions, now handled in another division of the same prosecution office.</p>
      <p>Yang stepped down as CEO and chief producer of YG in June amid rising drug allegations and a scandal involving YG artists.</p>
