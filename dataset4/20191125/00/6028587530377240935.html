      <p>Olivia Goodreau was a happy, healthy six-year-old taking a family summer vacation to the lake between first and second grade. She had a great trip, and came home ready to start her new school year. But over the following months, symptoms such as headaches, weakness, vision loss, body aches, hand tremors, and even ‘blackouts’ left everyone puzzled, including her family and multiple physicians. It took over 18 months to diagnose Olivia with Lyme disease, as she and her family had had no recollection of her having been bitten by a tick. Moreover, she had not developed the telltale bullseye rash typically seen soon after a tick makes its way under the skin. In fact, fewer than 40% of those bitten by a tick transmitting Lyme disease will have a bullseye rash, and ticks are incredibly small (about the size of a sesame seed), so it’s not surprising that they can be easily missed. If a tick bite is identified and Lyme infection is detected early (Lyme is caused by the bacterium <i>Borrelia</i>) it can be treated, many times effectively, with a course of antibiotics.</p>

      <p>But Olivia’s infection was indolent yet life-altering. After finally being diagnosed and receiving treatment, the road has been a long one for Olivia. As her disease has become chronic, she has required multiple medical therapies to treat her now potentially lifelong symptoms related to her infection.</p>
      <p>Olivia became passionate about her journey, and wished that there could be a way to educate others about the risks of tick-borne illnesses, as well as a means of providing research funding in the area of Lyme disease and other tick borne illnesses such as Powassan virus. (See my recent <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninashapiro/2019/11/05/rare-form-of-tick-borne-illness-lead-to-senators-death/#761726051baf"><i>Forbes</i></a> piece on the death of Senator Kay Hagan due to complications of a tick-borne Powassan virus infection). Olivia, now living with Lyme, created the <a href="https://livlymefoundation.org/">LivLyme Foundation,</a> a non-profit geared towards raising awareness of tick-borne illnesses and raising money to fund research in this challenging area. As a teenager, Olivia has presented to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, in effort to expand tick awareness globally. Ticks can attack livestock in many developing countries, wiping out populations of animals and devastating farming communities worldwide. Fundraising efforts of LivLyme have also enabled Olivia, at the age of 13, to be the youngest donor in the history of the Bloomberg School of Public Health at the Johns Hopkins University, donating <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/giving/donor-impact/Goodreau-Zhang.html">$25,000 of support</a> to their Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology to study treatments and prevention of Lyme Disease. In addition, the LivLyme Foundation has provided research grants to Stanford University and other institutions across the country. It has also provided support to 31 children suffering from tick-borne illnesses, helping fund their medical costs.</p>
      <p>A few years after creating LivLyme, while on another family trip to the lake, Olivia’s dog was bitten by ticks. This time, all 200 of these critters (yes, 200) were visible. Thankfully, her family was able to get quick treatment for their dog, but the type of tick that got to their pet was not known. There was no easy way for Olivia and her family to identify the type of tick, nor were they able to assess the risk of getting bitten by more ticks during their trip. This led Olivia to begin working on creating an app to track and identify ticks in real time.</p>
      <p>Eight months later, <a href="https://ticktracker.com/">TickTracker App </a>went live. As up to 400,000 individuals are diagnosed with Lyme disease due to tick bites annually in this country alone, Olivia felt it was time to provide a free, accessible means of identifying regions with high tick populations, provide awareness of tick-borne illnesses in real-time, as well as to enable a source for better identifying tick types when they are seen. The app also provides information on tick bite prevention, recognition, and methods of removal if bitten. While the app has already had over 20,000 downloads to date, it continues to be updated and modified. Olivia hopes to help develop an AI initiative with Microsoft, whereby app users can snap a photo of the tick they see, and the tracker will provide information on that particular tick. Let me remind you again, Olivia is barely 15.</p>

      <p>But wait, there’s more. Not only has the app gone global, soon to help farming communities prevent loss of livestock and livelihood, Olivia’s work serves to support the TICK (<b>T</b>icks: <b>I</b>dentify, <b>C</b>ontrol, and <b>K</b>nockout) Act, already approved by several senators including those from Maine and Minnesota. The functions of the Act would be as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Establish an Office of Oversight and Coordination </b>at HHS to develop a National Strategy, expand research, improve testing and testing, and coordinate common efforts with DOD, USDA, EPA, and the Departments of Interior and Homeland Security</li>
        <li><b>Reauthorize Regional Centers of Excellence in Vector Borne Disease </b>at $10 million for each of FY2021 - FY2026. These Centers collaborate with academia and public health agencies for surveillance, prevention, outbreak response.</li>
        <li><b>Authorize CDC Grants </b>at $20 million for each of FY2021 - FY2026 to State health departments to build a public health infrastructure for Lyme and other tick and vector- borne diseases, and expand initiatives through public-private partnerships.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With recent decades seeing warming winters and changing ecosystems, tick populations are rising, and the incidence of tick-borne illnesses have risen astronomically. A young warrior has made it her mission to raise awareness, support research efforts, and create a user-friendly app to identify tick populations, which are now seen worldwide. All this in the face of suffering from the chronic effects of a tick-borne illness on a daily basis herself.</p>
      <p>Ticks are now found on every continent, and in most states in the U.S. As with most infections, prevention is the best option, so knowing if you’re in a highly populated tick area should alert you to act diligently by wearing protective clothing, pre-treating clothing with proper tick repellant, and being vigilant for any tick bites by doing routine ‘tick checks’ after being outdoors.</p>
