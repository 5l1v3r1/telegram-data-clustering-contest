      <p>AUBURN, Ala. (AP) - Authorities say a second man arrested in the disappearance of a UFC heavyweight fighter’s stepdaughter disposed of evidence in the case.</p>
      <p>Police arrested 35-year-old Antwain Shamar Fisher of Montgomery on first-degree kidnapping charges in the disappearance last month of 19-year-old Aniah Blanchard. Police earlier charged 29-year-old Ibraheem Yazeed.</p>

      <p>Blanchard was last seen Oct. 23 in Auburn. Her stepfather is UFC fighter Walt Harris of metro Birmingham. Blanchard remains missing.</p>
