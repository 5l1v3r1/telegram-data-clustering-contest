      <h1>Uber's London license hangs in the balance on expiry day</h1>

      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - London's transport regulator said on Monday it has yet to decide on whether to renew Uber's (N:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/uber-technologies-inc">UBER</a>) operating license in the city after a media report said the taxi app would lose its right to take rides in Britain's capital.</p>
      <p>LBC radio reported on Monday, the day the Silicon Valley firm's license expires in London, that Uber will not receive a new license in one of its most important markets, citing several unnamed sources.</p>
      <p>A spokesman Transport for London said no decision has been made. Uber declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Uber and TfL have been engaged in a long-running battle since the authority rejected a renewal request in 2017, citing shortcomings it said it found in the firm's approach to reporting serious criminal offences and driver background checks, prompting legal action.</p>
      <p>A judge in 2018 then granted Uber (N:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/uber-technologies-inc">UBER</a>) a probationary 15-month license, after the Silicon Valley-based company had made several changes to its business model.</p>
      <p>In September, TfL gave Uber just a two-month extension, far short of the maximum possible five years, and imposed further conditions covering ride-sharing, appropriate insurance and driver document checks.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the latest decision, Uber said it would introduce measures such as a discrimination button enabling drivers and riders to report abuse, enhanced safety training for drivers and a direct connection to the emergency services.</p>
