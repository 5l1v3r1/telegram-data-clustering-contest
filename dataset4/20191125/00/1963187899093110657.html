      <p>ALEXANDRIA, Egypt, Nov 25 (MENA) - Alexandria and North Coast Antiquities chief Mohamed Metwali underlined on Monday the importance of Abu Mena archaeological site in Alexandria, saying it was placed on UNESCO's World Heritage List. <br/><br/>Yesterday, many visitors came to the site on the occasion of the anniversary of Saint Menas of Alexandria, who died in 296 A.D. <br/><br/>Abu Mena was a town, monastery complex and Christian pilgrimage center in Late Antique Egypt. It is located about 45 km southwest of Alexandria. <br/><br/>There are very few standing remains, but the foundations of most major buildings, such as the great basilica, are easily discernible. <br/><br/>It was named after Saint Menas (Abu Mena) who was martyred. His body was taken from Alexandria on a camel, which was led into the desert beyond Lake Mareotis. At some point, the camel refused to continue walking, despite all efforts to goad it. <br/><br/>This was taken as a sign of divine will, and the body was buried on that spot.</p>
