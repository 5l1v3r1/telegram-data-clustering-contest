      <p>Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG), in partnership with Jindal Holidays, is set to open a new Holiday Inn branded property in Corbett National Park, Ramnagar — Situated in north India, Corbett is estimated to have one of the highest tiger population in the country, thereby making it popular among leisure and adventure travellers. Besides, owing to its close proximity to Delhi NCR, Lucknow and Chandigarh, the region is also establishing itself as an offbeat MICE and wedding destination.</p>
      <p>Commenting on this news, Sudeep Jain, vice president, development, south west Asia, IHG said, “We are delighted to partner with Jindal Holidays for our first Holiday Inn Resort near the oldest tiger reserve in India. Over the years, Corbett National Park has witnessed an increase in the number of visitors as it is well connected with many major north Indian cities. We see this as a great opportunity to offer a world-class, quality accommodation option to the travellers, with the launch of our first resort under the Holiday Inn brand family in Corbett.</p>
      <p>The 100-key Holiday Inn Resort Corbett Ramnagar is expected to open its doors by Q1 2023. An all-day dining and a specialty restaurant, a bar, a lounge, an outdoor pool and a fitness centre will be available at the resort.</p>
      <p>For corporate events, this IHG resort will feature a business centre, boardrooms and an outdoor lawn with a capacity of around 500 guests. <a href="https://www.ihg.com/hotels/us/en/reservation"><b>ihg.com</b></a></p>
