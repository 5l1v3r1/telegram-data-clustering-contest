      <h1>The Realme X50 will be this brand's first ever 5G phone</h1>

        <b>Realme's CEO, Xu Qi Chase, has announced the X50 via Weibo. This upcoming phone is to be the first phone to launch under this brand-name with 5G. This phone may also have a dual punch-hole selfie camera, and may offer an "advanced experience".</b>
      </p>
      <p>Realme's CEO has <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4442457502191327?sudaref=login.sina.com.cn">announced</a> a new mobile device from this <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OPPO-trademarks-its-own-in-house-mobile-chipset-in-Europe.443878.0.html">OPPO</a> sub-brand. It is called the X50, and is to be this company's first phone with <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/A-new-Honor-phone-appears-on-Geekbench-could-be-a-5G-V30-variant.443704.0.html">5G</a>. A teaser released with this announcement shows what could be <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Honor-V30-series-launch-date-is-confirmed-as-is-its-5G-aspect.442686.0.html">dual punch-hole</a> selfie cameras peeping out of this image from a front panel. Furthermore, the same image seems to indicate beyond a doubt that the X50's 5G will be dual-band. This suggests that it may rock the only SoC capable of this connectivity at present: the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-announces-Exynos-980-SoC-with-integrated-5G-modem.434141.0.html">Exynos 980</a>.</p>
      <p>Should this be the case, it may put the <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4442457502191327?sudaref=login.sina.com.cn">Realme X50</a> squarely in the cross-hairs of the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Exynos-980-powered-Vivo-X30-might-show-up-tomorrow.441313.0.html">Vivo X30</a> series. These are the only other upcoming phones <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Vivo-discloses-more-detail-on-the-5G-X30-except-not-really.441927.0.html">known to</a> run on this processor. They are currently <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/A-Vivo-5G-phone-passes-3C-certification-which-reveals-33W-charging.444015.0.html">thought to</a> be worthwhile phones beyond their 5G features, with rumors hinting at 60MP quad cameras, 4500mAh batteries with 33-watt charging and at least 8GB of RAM.</p>
      <p>The possible <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4442457502191327?sudaref=login.sina.com.cn">Realme alternative</a> may be no slouch, either: its brand's CEO has also indicated that it will offer an "advanced experience". However, the same will apparently be along the lines of that delivered by other <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Realme-X-is-an-example-of-community-development-done-right.440602.0.html">X-series</a> variants, which to date include the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OPPO-unveils-the-new-Snapdragon-730G-powered-K5.438949.0.html">Snapdragon 730G</a>-powered <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Oppo-Realme-X2.440791.0.html">X2</a> and the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Oppo-Realme-XT.434185.0.html">XT</a>, which runs on the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Qualcomm-Snapdragon-712-SoC.406496.0.html">712</a> and has a <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Realme-XT-goes-on-flash-sale-on-Flipkart-64-MP-quad-camera-Super-AMOLED-display-and-Snapdragon-712-for-15-999.434798.0.html">64MP camera</a>. The <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-announces-Exynos-980-SoC-with-integrated-5G-modem.434141.0.html">Exynos 980</a>, which is an 8-nanometer (nm) octa-core chipset with a maximum clock of 2.20 GHz and a Mali-G76 MP5 GPU, may compete well among these decent mid-range options.</p>
