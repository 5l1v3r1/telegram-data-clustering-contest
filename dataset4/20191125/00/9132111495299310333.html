      <p>Kwame Asare Obeng alias A Plus has called out President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo for failing to condemn his attack dogs who insult his critics with all sort of names including ‘useless Ashawos’ alleging that the President’s silence amounts to supporting the actions.</p>
      <p>A Plus who until recently is a known NPP member, has detailed how he tirelessly defended the integrity of the President when he was a presidential candidate and faced myriad choice insults from his opponents.</p>
      <p>He, however, is disappointed that the President seems to endorse the raining of insults on critics of the NPP.</p>
      <p>“They said Nana Addo is a wee smoker, we said he is not. We defended him because yes, he is not. They said Nana sniffs cocaine, we said no he does not. It’s just lies. They said Nana Addo killed his wife, we said no!!! He will never do such a thing. He is a good man. They said Nana Addo is arrogant. We said no!!! He is confident. We spent close to 10 years defending him till he became president. Today, when you simply ask what he has done as president, he sends his people to insult you and call women ashawo. Yes, it’s Nana. He hears everything. He has not condemned it. He is enjoying it. He supports it. Those who do that are his heroes. Very disappointing!!! This president is not my Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo Addo, the world-class diplomat I knew in 07/08,” he wrote on social media Friday sighted by MyNewsGh.com.</p>
      <p>His comments come on the back of insults that have been rained on many critics of the NPP, especially broadcast journalist Nana Aba Anamoah after she criticised the NPP for constantly comparing its record with the National Democratic Congress (NDC) instead of telling Ghanaians how they are fulfilling their promises.</p>
