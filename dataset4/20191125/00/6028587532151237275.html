      <p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/">Samsung’s</a> passion for folding smartphone devices continues to be on show. Following the announcement of the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-fold/">Samsung Galaxy Fold and Galaxy Fold 5G</a> in February, the South Korean company has been busy filing and publishing patents for a range of devices.One of the latest documents published suggests that Samsung is working on a more budget-friendly folding smartphone.</p>

      <p><a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-fold-opvouwbare-tablet/">Ilse Jurrien has taken a closer look at the recent design patent</a> to find out more:</p>
      <p>“Samsung Electronics filed a design patent with The Hague International Designs Bulletin on 9 May 2019. The patent called “Mobile telephone” was approved on November 15, 2019 and includes, in addition to a brief description, about 35 images... </p>
      <p>“The design differs from the current Fold, but also from the developing clamshell Fold. This new device can perhaps best be described as a broad folding phone. You can fold the device horizontally. Folded open creates a fairly wide and long flexible screen.</p>
      <p>“…The first design in particular seems to be a good addition to the Galaxy Fold 2 that is currently being developed. After all, not everyone will prefer a folding phone design, with a narrow elongated screen. If Samsung decides to also release a foldable tablet, consumers will retain the choice to also opt for a larger screen size.”</p>
      <p>To go with the patent, <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-fold-opvouwbare-tablet/">Jurrien and the team at Let’s Go Digital</a> have put together a number of images and renders of the potential device.</p>

      <p>As well as the cutting edge technology that led to a delay in releasing the handset for public sale, the other notable feature of the first Galaxy Fold was the launch price. Coming in at close to $2000, this was a price that reflected both the cutting edge technology and the presumably shorter production runs when compared to the Galaxy S and Galaxy A product lines.</p>
      <p>So it makes sense that Samsung would - after another year of experience with filing displays, look to broaden the market out to more consumers with a cheaper device. Stripping out the secondary screen and reducing the build cost, coupled with production efficiencies through experience, all contributing to a larger manufacturing run could see the price point come down during 2020, perhaps to the point where an ‘entry-level’ device such as the concept here is closer in price to the major flagships,</p>
