      <p>General Electric on Monday named an outsider as finance chief, a move that comes as the troubled industrial conglomerate has slimmed-down its number of businesses and its recently installed CEO seeks to replenish the executive bench with like-minded leaders.GE, which last year named its first CEO from outside its ranks in Larry Culp, said in a <a href="https://www.genewsroom.com/press-releases/ge-names-carolina-dybeck-happe-chief-financial-officer">press release</a> that Carolina Dybeck Happe was slated to assume the CFO post in early 2020. Dybeck Happe has been finance chief at Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk for 11 months, according to her Linkedin profile. Previously, she spent 16 years with Stockholm-based Assa Abloy, a maker of locks and security doors.</p>
      <p>Culp didn’t know Dybeck Happe before the search to fill the CFO position, which was announced in July, said Nicholas Heymann, an analyst with investment bank William Blair. But Culp saw a reflection of his own strategy for GE in Dybeck Happe’s work, including her support for smaller, central corporate teams and tight control of costs, Heymann said.</p>
      <p>“I think the second thing is, she has a lot of different operating experience,” Heymann added. Culp “is looking for a person to be a spark for operational improvement and growth, not a bean counter.”</p>
      <p>Dybeck Happe will replace Jamie Miller, who assumed the CFO post in 2017. Miller’s appointment was among the first moves of then-CEO John Flannery, a 30-year GE veteran who was suddenly fired as the company’s deepening woes became clear. Ms. Miller is slated to leave the company after a transition.</p>
      <p>“We applaud CFO Jamie Miller for capably managing the role through what was arguably the toughest period in the company’s history,” said Deane Dray, a RBC analyst, in a client note on Monday. “Miller has been forced to make many tough decisions, including multiple dividend cuts, a $15…(billion) insurance reserve shortfall, write-downs of legacy Alstom businesses, a pension plan freeze, and many others.” </p>
      <p>Flannery’s outster, in October of last year, came after the company revealed a larger-than-expected $23 billion charge linked to its power business, which was acquired from French company Alstom in 2015. The unit was hurt by the prolonged downturn in the energy market and weak demand, analysts said.</p>
      <p>Flannery’s 14-month tenure was followed by Culp, the former CEO of conglomerate Danaher, which focuses on life-science, among other businesses. Dybeck Happe “will be a strong partner as we execute our deleveraging plan and improve our operating results to position GE for sustainable, long-term value creation,” Culp said in a statement.      </p>
      <p>GE, once synonymous with American manufacturing might, was founded in 1892 after the merger of the company of inventor Thomas Edison and the Thomson-Houston company and was one of the first <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveschaefer/2011/07/15/the-first-12-dow-components-where-are-they-now/#6382539bb032">12 companies</a> listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p>
      <p>The company has stumbled in recent years, slashing it dividend, missing profit targets and facing criminal and regulatory probes into its accounting practices. The Department of Justice and the Securities Exchange Commission launched probes into the power unit charge as well as insurance losses and the company’s revenue recognition practices, among a number of recent probes. </p>
      <p>In a turnaround plan that has spanned both the tenures of Flannery and Culp, GE exited the locomotive construction business, portions of its healthcare business and the oil and gas sector. Culp looked to reduce debt by freezing the pension of some 20,000 workers, among other moves.</p>
      <p>Culp has also looked to rebuild the company’s executive ranks, a once celebrated talent pipeline. During his brief time at the company he has reached outside of GE to name new leaders of human resources, investor relations and the healthcare unit as well as a new chief actuary in insurance.</p>
      <p>Dybeck Happe is now the highest ranking executive in this trend of pulling executives in from the outside, said Brian Langenberg, who runs securities research firm Langenberg &amp; Co. “He wants to rebuild senior leadership,” Langenberg said. “He’s looking for no BS people.”</p>
      <p>Dray of RBC said that Dybeck Happe’s first priority entering the job should be getting up to speed on “the intricacies of GE’s financial reporting,” a task he estimates could take as long as six months.</p>
      <p>“In our view, her priorities should include: smoothing out GE’s cash flow generation, resolving ongoing SEC and DoJ reviews, and enhancing transparency around contract accounting practices,” he added.</p>
