      <p>Leading bourse BSE has said it will start non-competitive bidding facility in state development loans (SDLs) which will enable the retail investors to participate in these auctions through an online registration process.</p>
      <p>SDLs are dated securities issued by state governments through normal bidding process similar to the auctions conducted for such securities issued by the central government, where interest is received semi-annually, and principal is repaid at maturity.</p>
      <p>In a statement, BSE has announced the "introduction of non-competitive bidding facility in state development loans. Retail investors can now participate in these auctions through an easy online registration process".</p>
      <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its various measures to encourage retail participation has extended access to primary auctions to SDLs.</p>
      <p>The RBI conducts auctions for such securities on a weekly basis where 10 per cent of the notified amount is allotted for eligible investors under the scheme for non-competitive bidding (NCB).</p>
      <p>"We are happy that from now onwards BSE can act as a facilitator for non-competitive bidding under RBI's auction to aggregate the bids from retail investors and submit a single bid to RBI. This facility will go a long way in strengthening the capital markets," BSE MD and CEO Ashishkumar Chauhan said.</p>
      <p>The exchange's non-competitive bidding facility will be in addition to the government securities and treasury bills which are currently being offered through its platforms -- BSE Direct App and bsedirect.com website.</p>
      <p>Last week, rival bourse National Stock Exchange (NSE) had introduced the same facility.</p>
