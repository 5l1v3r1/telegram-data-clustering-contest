      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Just Eat (L:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/just-eat">JE</a>) advised shareholders not to accept a 710 pence-a-share cash offer from Prosus (AS:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/prosus">PRX</a>), saying it was inferior to its agreed deal with Takeaway.com (AS:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/takeaway-com-holding-bv">TKWY</a>) to create the largest food delivery player outside China.</p>
      <p>"Your Board believes that the Takeaway.com combination provides Just Eat shareholders with greater value creation than the Prosus offer," it said in a letter to investors on Monday, adding that the Prosus offer also significantly undervalued Just Eat on a standalone basis.</p>
