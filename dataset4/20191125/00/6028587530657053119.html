      <p><b>Topline:</b> EBay’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50549048">$4 billion</a> sale of ticket reseller StubHub to Swiss competitor Viagogo comes after activist investors had pressured the struggling ecommerce giant to unload its more distant assets.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The combined companies will resell tickets in over 70 countries once the deal is completed.</li>
        <li>The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elliott-management-calls-for-ebay-to-shed-stubhub-classified-ads-business-11548166204?mod=article_inline">reported</a> in January that two activist investors, Elliott Management and Starboard Value, advised eBay to shed parts of its business⁠—specifically StubHub and an international classifieds service⁠—that were unrelated to its online marketplace (eBay’s stock rose 1% on the news).</li>
        <li>Viagogo has been <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/117595699/viagogo-behind-big-surge-in-consumer-complaints-to-commerce-commission">mired</a> in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/hundreds-are-complaining-about-viagogo-selling-tickets-to-events-before-tickets-are-even-available-2017-8">legal issues</a> across the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/feb/17/viagogo-condemned-ed-sheeran-cancer-benefit-concert-tickets-teenage-cancer-trust">world</a> over the past two years, including being found guilty by an Australian court <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/apr/18/ticket-reseller-viagogo-found-guilty-of-misleading-consumers">in April</a> of misleading customers, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/18/google-suspends-viagogo-from-advertising-over-trust-concerns.html">in July</a> was temporarily suspended by Google from advertising on its platform due to policy violations.</li>
        <li>A Viagogo spokesperson said it has worked with Google “to address the concerns” and has “returned to its traditional relationship” with the Mountain View-based tech company.</li>
        <li>Most recently, Viagogo narrowly <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49591794">avoided legal action</a> in the U.K. over the way it communicated ticket availability and other information to customers, but a government watchdog backed down after Viagogo made changes to its website. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Key background: </b>Before he started Viagogo, CEO Eric Baker also founded StubHub while he was still in business school. Baker sold StubHub to eBay for $310 million in 2007. Since then, eBay has been struggling as consumers change their online shopping habits. Although eBay historically touted itself as an online auction website, 80% of its total sales are new items sold at a fixed price. StubHub accounted for 14% of eBay’s third-quarter earnings⁠—and eBay warned investors its fourth-quarter results <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ebay-profit-falls-as-strategic-review-continues-11571865076?mod=article_inline">could decline</a> for the first time in four years  StubHub has also been involved in various lawsuits over the years; one class action claim, filed in February in California’s Superior Court, <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8460853/stubhub-lawsuit-hidden-fee-drip-pricing-allegations">accused</a> StubHub of unlawfully tacking on ticket fees. Spokespeople for eBay and Viagogo declined to comment on the class action.</p>
      <p><b>Tangent:</b> According to a Viagogo spokesperson, both it and StubHub will continue operating independently of each other in the immediate future. The spokesperson said no layoffs or organizational changes are planned.</p>
