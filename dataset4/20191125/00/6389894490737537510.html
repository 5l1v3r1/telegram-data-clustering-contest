      <p>It also finds that more than half a million working women in the UK have experienced domestic violence and abuse in the past 12 months. Of these, 122,000 have taken time off work in the period.</p>
      <p>Globally, the figures showed that 80m working women across 107 countries – or 15 per cent of the world’s female workforce – had experienced domestic violence in this period.</p>
      <p>More than one third – 38 per cent – of victims surveyed said they suffered from reduced productivity and 22 per cent said they sometimes stopped going to work and/or would take days off. </p>
      <p>KPMG analysis of records on domestic violence and abuse victims also revealed that the length of unplanned leave averages at 10.1 days per woman.</p>
      <p>Helen Lamprell, general counsel and external affairs director of the Vodafone UK Foundation said: “Domestic abuse has such a huge effect on the individual, their family and friends and a vast financial impact to both the individual and the UK economy. </p>
