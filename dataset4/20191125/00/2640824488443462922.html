      <p><b>with the idea to spread a message of <i>’empowerment through education’</i>, NUDES has designed the bookworm to travel across india, in both rural and urban areas. </b>the structure is built using 3600 modular pre-fabricated components, meaning that it can be easily dismantled, transported and reassembled on different sites. deployed on site within a week, the pavilion also boasts a low carbon footprint and promotes sustainable building technologies.</p>

      <p><b>this project has been realized to address the startling number of people that still lack basic reading and writing skills across the world, and especially in</b> <b>sub-saharan africa and southern asia. </b>proven to help improve health, reduce crime and alleviate poverty, boosting literacy rates marks an important step in providing better opportunities to all. NUDES’ bookworm has been supported by priyasri art gallery in collaboration with the CSMVS museum in affiliation with the children’s museum CSMVS. the pavilion will remain on site at the museum lawns in mumbai until december 2019 before traveling all over india, from cities to rural areas. </p>
