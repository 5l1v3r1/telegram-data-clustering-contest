        <b>Carisbrook-Dunedin 127 lost to Taieri 128 for two</b>
      </p>
      <p>Taieri maintained its unbeaten record in the senior men’s one-day tournament with a comprehensive eight-wicket win against Carisbrook-Dunedin at Brooklands Park on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Otago batsman Dale Phillips bagged three for 17 with his medium pacers and fringe Volts player Harsh Visavadiya took four for 12 from 6.2 overs.</p>
      <p>The wrist spinner was in fine form and their combined efforts had Carisbrook-Dunedin all out for 127. Richard Sillars got the bulk of those runs.</p>
      <p>He added 52 and got some help from Liam Ryan with 30. No-one else in the line-up reached double figures.</p>
      <p>Visavadiya (48) and Phillips (35 not out) teamed up again with the bat. The pair put on 61 to help knock off the target with almost 30 overs to spare.</p>
      <p>Taieri is five from five and has a healthy 31-point lead at the top of the competition standings.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Albion 105 beat Green Island 104</b>
      </p>
      <p>Who knew 105 would be a winning score at Sunnyvale?</p>
      <p>Certainly not Green Island. The champion club side would have fancied itself after dismissing Albion for the modest tally.</p>
      <p>But turns out the 46 runs Albion’s Jack Coman ground out with the bat was the difference between the two teams.</p>
      <p>He watched from one end has his side slumped to be 78 for five. He carried the team passed 100 but was run out shortly after.</p>

      <p>His departure sparked a rapid decline.</p>
      <p>The wickets were shared around but veteran all-rounder Mark Joyce had the biggest bag, with three for 13.</p>
      <p>Green Island opener Joel Meade set anchor at one end and tried to guide his side past the target.</p>
      <p>But former Otago all-rounder Sam Wells (four for 22) and Matt West (four for 15) tore through the batting line-up.</p>
      <p>Meade was eventually undone on 28 and Gregor Croudis helped stem the flow of wickets with 24.</p>
      <p>But West sealed the dramatic one-run win for Albion when he dismissed Jack Mockford for nine.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kaikorai 234 beat University-Grange 186</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rhys Bayly-led Kaikorai to a 48-run win against University-Grange with a fine century at Bishopscourt.</p>
      <p>The opener posted 102 from 131 balls to help his side reach 234. He had minimal support other than a cameo from No9 Vinay Chandrappa. He chipped in with 27 at the death.</p>
      <p>Usman Shah and Michael Ruske took three wickets each for University-Grange in a solid bowling effort.</p>
      <p>The visitor made a decent start with the bat. Veteran batsman Andrew Hore (27) and Todd Anderson (44) added 38 for the first wicket.</p>
      <p>Harrison Biggs (20) and Ben Hatton (28) helped chip away at the target.</p>
      <p>But Ryan Whelan (three for 44) and Mason James (three for 33) proved too effective. And Matt Hunter claimed two for 21 to help dismiss University-Grange for 186.</p>
