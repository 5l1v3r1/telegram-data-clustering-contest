      <h1>Tom Brady Speaks On Possibility of Playing For Another Team In 2020</h1>

      <p>Tom Brady has repeatedly expressed a desire to play late into his 40’s, and if that means playing for another team, he seems ready to do that as well.</p>
      <p>During a sit-down interview with FOX’s Erin Andrews that aired on Sunday, he was asked whether he could see himself playing for a different team. Brady stated he wasn’t going to make a prediction, but he seemed to prioritize playing as long as he wants, regardless of team.</p>
      <blockquote>“The reality is there is no prediction. I have always said I have a plan to play longer and I will figure that out when the time comes,” Brady said.</blockquote>
      <p>He also was asked about proving doubters wrong by playing late into his 40’s.</p>
      <blockquote>“I think it would be pretty cool to do that. I definitely think there is an inspirational element to that,” Brady said. “There’s just different challenges. There were challenges when I was young, there’s challenges now. I think just understanding what those are and whether you want to face those or take them or overcome them, those are healthy things and healthy decisions to have. When the time’s right, I’ll make a decision.”</blockquote>
      <p>Brady’s contract expires after the season and he is selling a home in Massachusetts, however, not many experts expect he nor the team to part ways with each other.</p>
