      <p>Some Assembly Members within the Greater Region have kicked against moves to make local level elections partisan.</p>
      <p>They are of the opinion that, the politicization of local level polls will prevent competent people from contesting such elections.</p>
      <p>The December 17 referendum which is aimed at legitimizing the participation of political parties at local level elections has been greeted with mixed reaction.</p>
      <p>While the government and some civil society organization are in support of a ‘Yes’ vote, the opposition NDC, some organizations and a section of the National House of Chiefs are advocating for a ‘No’ vote.</p>
      <p>In a Citi News interview, two of these assembly members campaigning for a ‘NO’ vote said political parties participation in local level elections will increase the cost of the elections and breed corruption.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Odartey Xerton, who is the Assembly Member for Ringway Electoral Area said:</p>
      <p>“For political parties getting involved into assembly elections, it is a big no. I personally came into this business without the help of any political party. If it is allowed, are they telling us people like me cannot get the chance to go into the elections? When parties start funding assembly elections, we have to file for primaries through their laws before we get their support.”</p>
      <p>For the Assembly Member for Osu Alata, Hubert Kpakpo Garshong, there is no need for level governance to be partisan.</p>
      <p>“I am for a NO. The reason being that, we don’t want the local assemblies to be politicized because that is the only place that we hardly see politics dividing us. I feel politics should be left at the top for the base to be left as it is”, he said.</p>

        <b>Asantehene calls for more engagements on December 17 referendum</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, wants broader stakeholder consultation on the referendum.</p>
      <p>He says the exercise cannot be rushed given its crucial nature, hence the need for thorough engagements with all the relevant stakeholders.</p>
      <p>Otumfuo Osei Tutu II said engagement with chiefs, political parties and other stakeholders will be a step in the right direction.</p>
      <p>“If there had been such engagement, I could not think of how anyone would have ignored the logic in the case for according our chiefs the rightful representation in the new structure. And by the same token, I could not think of how any chief would have seen any incompatibility in the removal of the entrenched clauses in the Constitution to permit the election of the metro and district chief executives or mayors and also allow political parties to sponsor candidates for local elections,” he added.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Arguments against December 17 referendum ridiculous – Dan Botwe</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Minister for Regional Reorganization and Development, Dan Kwaku Botwe wants the December 17 referendum which will make local government elections partisan halted for broader consultations.</p>
      <p>He believes it will only be prudent if the referendum is totally withdrawn given what he terms as “ridiculous arguments” about the exercise.</p>
      <p>“People are saying we should postpone it. But I am asking why it should be postponed? We should withdraw and forget about it. The whole issue is about a president who wants to deepen multi-party democracy at the district assembly level. It is happening in other countries so the ridiculous argument of dividing the country further doesn’t make sense. We are deepening the principle of multi-party democracy at the district assembly level and they say that will divide the country because there is a division at the top. People put out such baseless statements; gain currency and I am amazed.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>December 17 Referendum</b>
      </p>
      <p>The referendum is to decide on a possible amendment of Article 55 (3) of the 1992 Constitution to enable political parties to sponsor candidates for local level elections.</p>
      <p>The outcome will have either of the following outcomes: If the electorate votes YES, the election of MMDCEs, Assembly and Unit Committee Members in the near future will be on a partisan basis.</p>
      <p>If they vote NO, then the election of these candidates for the local level elections will be on a non-partisan basis as being practised now.</p>
