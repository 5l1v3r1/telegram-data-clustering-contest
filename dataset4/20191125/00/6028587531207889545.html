      <p>Six years since founding product discovery site Product Hunt, Ryan Hoover says he isn’t planning to step away anytime soon. That hasn’t stopped him from doubling down on a recent product of his own: venture capital firm Weekend Fund. In 2017, months after AngelList acquired Product Hunt for a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/12/1/13802154/angellist-product-hunt-acquisition">reported</a> $20 million, Hoover <a href="https://medium.com/@rrhoover/weekend-fund-%EF%B8%8F-72dfdc830f00">announced</a> the Weekend Fund, a $3 million fund for backing early-stage startup companies. Now Hoover is back with a second $10 million fund—and a promise to practice what he preaches by testing new ways for investors to help entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p>“The best way to get better at something is just to do it,” Hoover says. “With this next one, we are thinking through how we invest in product, not in the traditional sense, but in products that are operational things that can really add value longer-term.”</p>
      <p>The second Weekend Fund will seek to write $100,000-to-$200,000 first checks to about 40 to 45 companies, Hoover says, at the pre-seed or seed stages—whenever a founder raises his or her first meaningful funding round. Generalist in its scope, the fund will broadly invest along two themes, according to Hoover: “consumer behavior shifts,” or services that change how people behave in the world (he points to Snapchat as a classic example); and “platform shifts” like businesses capitalizing on the possibilities of building voice-first apps for Amazon Alexa or Google Home (a portfolio company, Voiceflow, looks to help others do just that).</p>
      <p>As Hoover’s other long-term product after Product Hunt, Hoover says, Weekend Fund serves two groups of customers: the limited partners invested in the fund and the founders it promises to support. For the latter, Hoover and the fund’s sole full-time employee, Vedika Jain, say they’ve been working on projects you won’t find at other firms. “How is it possible that venture capital funds don’t have to find product-market fit themselves?” asks Jain, officially Hoover’s chief of staff but handling many full-time functions for the fund. “We want to be playing at the edges of what early-stage funding looks like.”</p>
      <p>Their signature experiment is Weekend Build, a program that supports would-be entrepreneurs working on projects part-time. Ten projects were selected out of 650 applications to join a Slack community and commit to hourly weekly virtual standups on Sundays with Hoover and their peers, as well as gain access to targeted office hours with Weekend Fund’s network of about 400 advisers. With unanimously positive feedback, according to Jain, the two are now looking at how to improve Build to identify more people and guide them to the point of launching a startup full-time. “It’s a big responsibility to encourage someone to quit their job,” Hoover says.</p>
      <p>Hoover knows that challenge from experience. Product Hunt began as a side project originally, and he says he has no plans to leave his role at the company to work on Weekend Fund full time. Hoover and Jain use dedicated Slack channels for each potential deal, Zapier-based automations and an in-development internal CRM tool to communicate between London and Los Angeles, where Hoover works remotely on all his projects. One-quarter of the portfolio is based outside the U.S.; Hoover says he’s gotten to know most of the founders entirely online. “From the outside, it looks like Ryan is running Weekend Fund on the side. But he really just does two full-time jobs,” says Jain, who signed on part-time herself seven months ago following stints at Mithril, Stripe and TrueLayer before transitioning to Weekend Fund’s first full-time role in the last two months.</p>
      <p>Whether the split focus is producing competitive results is hard to tell after just a few years of investing by the fund. Of 40 investments made by Weekend Fund’s first fund, 18 have raised subsequent funding at a higher valuation; one, Spectrum, has exited by sale to GitHub; none have shut down. Hoover cites Codeverse, Coinmine, Girlboss, Passport, Superplastic and Voiceflow as examples of some of the “marked-up” investments so far, backed by firms such as Craft Ventures, Founders Fund, Initialized, True Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners.</p>
      <p>With many young early-stage funds in the market—even some launched by Product Hunt alumni—Hoover believes early-stage investing will get more difficult in upcoming months, meaning that brand, reputation and a unique source of deal flow will prove key—something he believes he has, without causing a conflict of interest, through his work at Product Hunt. The hardest thing about being a VC, he says: not investing in friends’ companies. “I don’t like disappointing my friends,” Hoover says. “They always understand ultimately. … It’s not my money to give.”</p>
      <p>That outside capital, $13 million in total now, is also why Hoover insists no one should doubt his commitment to deliver top returns despite his fund’s unusual set-up. “When I raise capital, that is a very serious commitment for me and my ultimate mission,” he says. “That alone is enough motivation to make sure this is going to succeed.”</p>
