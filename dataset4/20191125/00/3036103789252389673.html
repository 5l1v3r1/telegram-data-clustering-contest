      <h1>Tesla Cybertruck gets more than 200,000 pre-orders</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>More than 200,000 customers have placed a deposit to pre-order Tesla’s Cybertruck.</p>
      <p>The electric bakkie was <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/motoring/328919-tesla-unveils-its-electric-cybertruck.html"><b>unveiled</b></a> at an event on 22 November, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk showing off its ability to withstand impacts from hammers, ball bearings, and bullets.</p>
      <p>It boasts impressive specs, such as a 0-100 km/h acceleration in 2.9 seconds and the ability to tow a 6-tonne load.</p>
      <p>The Cybertruck will be available in three electric motor variants – single ($39,900), dual ($49,900) and triple ($69,900).</p>
      <p>The first edition will offer 250 miles (400km) of range, while the top-of-the-line version will be able to drive up to 500 (800km) miles on a single charge.</p>
      <h3>Thousands of deposits</h3>
      <p>Musk revealed that the company had received 146,000 orders for the electric pick-up in a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198344195317985280"><b>tweet</b></a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Of these orders, 17% opted for the single motor, 42% for the dual-motor, and 41% for the triple-motor edition.</p>
      <p>Earlier today, Musk sent out a tweet with the line “200K”, suggesting that the number of deposits had now grown to 200,000.</p>
      <p>This initial popularity is impressive considering that the first Cybertrucks will only be put into commercial production in late 2021, with the high-end editions only scheduled for manufacturing in 2022.</p>
      <p>In addition to the news, Musk also tweeted a video of the Cybertruck in a tug-of-war with a Ford F-150 pickup truck.</p>
