      <h1>Professor: Terraforming a New Home Planet Would Be Dangerous</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Robitzski</a></address>
      <h3>Woah There</h3>
      <p>Jeff Bezos wants <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/jeff-bezos-ridiculous-space-habitats">orbital space colonies</a>. Elon Musk wants a <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-mars-city-1000-starship">city on Mars</a>.</p>
      <p>These are ambitious goals for the off-world future of humanity — but they’re also misguided, according to York University anthropologist Kathryn Denning. Denning <a href="https://www.space.com/planet-b-for-earth-not-good-space-exploration-reason.html">told <i>Space.com</i></a> that the idea of building a colony to which humanity could escape if the Earth becomes uninhabitable is not only an unrealistic idea, but a dangerous one as well.</p>
      <h3>Plan A</h3>
      <p>Denning argues that focusing on our interplanetary escape ignores the very real issues here on Earth — and that new <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/nasa-incredible-map-4000-exoplanets">discoveries in space</a> shouldn’t always be framed in terms of whether they can sustain humanity. Specifically, she worries that the search to replace Earth with a “planet B” frames environmental demise as inevitable.</p>
      <p>“For me, the question is balance,” Denning told <i>Space.com</i>. “How can we be enthusiastic about the human capacity to explore while maintaining our focus on what needs to happen here on this planet?”</p>
      <h3>Priorities</h3>
      <p>Besides, any off-world settlements would likely <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/thousands-years-colonize-mars">depend on Earth</a> for support or resources for generations and generations, Denning argues.</p>
      <p>“The reality is, what would be needed to create a sustainable human civilization in the solar system that could effectively be a backup for humanity? That, for every kind of foreseeable future for, say, the next hundred years, requires a functioning and sustainable civilization here,” she told <i>Space.com</i>.</p>
