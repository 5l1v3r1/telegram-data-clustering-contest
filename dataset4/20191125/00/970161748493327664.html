      <p>Liam Gallagher might not seem like your typical mummy’s boy – but his mum Peggy was right by his side ahead of his latest gig in Dublin.</p>
      <p>Bless.</p>
      <p>The pair were seen leaving the Irish capital’s swish Merrion Hotel ahead of the show, which is the first of his new tour.</p>
      <p>Given his various family woes – including an ongoing feud with brother Liam – it’s good to he has Peggy there for him.</p>
      <p>The former Oasis frontman will play 25 dates across Europe between now and late February, including dates in Vienna, Berlin and Amsterdam.</p>
      <p>He’ll also play London’s O2 Arena on 28 and 29 November, but is skipping his native Manchester.</p>

      <p>The tour follows Noel’s recent comments that Liam’s Twitter account is the reason we don’t have an Oasis reunion. Gutted.</p>

      <p>‘It’s strange behaviour for someone who is gagging for me to pick up the phone and say let’s do it,’ he told <a href="https://www.bigissue.com/">The Big Issue</a>. ‘If you think for one minute I am going to share a stage with you after what you’ve said you are f****** more of a moron than you look.’</p>

      <p>Asked if it could happen if he stopped stirring things up, Noel added: ‘Of course it could. But there would have to be an extraordinary set of circumstances. But I don’t think he ever will stop. The modern image of him is defined by the angry guy on Twitter.’</p>
      <p>Fair.</p>

      <p>‘I left the band 10 years ago,’ he continued. ‘I think I’ve seen him twice in 10 years and both times we nearly ended up in a fight for no reason.</p>
      <p>‘I can’t envisage the morning I wake up and think I’d like to spend two years on the road, arguing all around the world with Liam.’</p>
      <p>Oasis, who have released seven albums, are known for hits like Wonderwall and D’you Know What I Mean?</p>
      <p>Their album Be Here Now was the fastest-selling in UK history, until Adele stole their crown with 25 back in 2015.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, despite being in the music industry for 25 years, Liam still knows how to pull it out the bag.</p>
      <p>This year he scored a number one album in the UK with Why Me? Why Not, which reached number two in Ireland.</p>
