      <h1>Options Betting Suggests Alphabet’s Stock Sees A Year-End Rally</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Kramer</a></address>
      <p><i>Michael Kramer and the clients of Mott Capital own GOOGL</i>Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL) stock has been steadily climbing higher since the beginning of June. Since then, the shares have increased by almost 24% from $1,038 on June 3 to $1,293 as of November 22. Now some options traders are betting the stock rises by an additional 5% by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>The stock made its latest move higher following its third quarter results, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kramermichael/2019/11/08/alphabets-stock-is-ready-to-soar/#5465ea3e2fd8">rising above a critical level of technical resistance</a>. Now that region of resistance is acting as a firm level of support for the stock. The chart also suggests that the shares of Alphabet still have further to climb.</p>
      <h3>Betting The Shares Will Rise</h3>
      <p>The options for expiration on December 20 have seen their open interest level for the $1,350 calls rise by 3,600 contracts in recent days, to roughly 3,850 contracts. The calls trade for approximately $5.55 per contract as of November 22, and that means for a buyer of the calls to earn a profit, the stock would need to rise to $1,355 by the expiration date in the middle of December. That is an increase of about 5% from the stock’s current price of roughly $1,293.</p>

      <h3>Big Level of Technical Support</h3>
      <p>The technical chart shows that the equity has crossed above a critical level of technical resistance at $1,290 on November 7. That level of resistance has been strong, going back to July 2018, with the stock failing to climb beyond that price on two prior occasions. It was on the third attempt at the beginning of November that the stock finally broke out, and now that level of resistance has turned to technical support. This region of support should serve as a floor for Alphabet’s stock. Additionally, the chart shows that the shares have been steadily rising in a trading channel since the beginning of October. Both the channel and the support level should help the stock to continue to push higher in the weeks ahead.</p>

      <h3>Price Targets Are Rising</h3>
      <p>Analysts have been pushing their price targets for the equity higher in recent weeks. Currently, the average analysts' price target on the stock is $1,446, which is 3% higher than the average target of $1,407 on October 22.</p>

      <h3>Earnings Estimates Are Falling</h3>
      <p>Despite the optimism among investors that are betting the shares will rise, the bullish technical chart, and increasing price target. Analysts have been lowering their earnings estimates for the company in 2020 and 2021. Analysts currently project earnings will grow by 9% to $53.01 per share in 2020, down from estimates for $55.69 at the end of October. Additionally, estimates for 2021 are now forecast to rise by 13.4% to $61.07 per share, which is lower than prior estimates for $64.35.</p>

      <p>While it's possible for the shares to continue to rise in the future, despite the prospects for weaker earnings, it is likely to result in investors paying a higher premium for the equity, pushing its price to earnings multiple higher in the process. The only thing that may hold the stock back in the future is just how much of a premium that investors will be willing to pay for the shares.</p>
