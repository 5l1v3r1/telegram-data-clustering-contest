      <h1>One of South Africa’s largest employers says its FinTech is making a killing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/author/staff-writer/" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>Pepkor on Monday (25 November), reported a 9% rise in revenue for the year ended September 2019, to R69.6 billion, “despite a very difficult retail environment where consumer spending remained constrained, fuelled by high levels of unemployment and low economic growth”.</p>
      <p>Operating profit declined 5.5% to R5.5 billion, while operating profit from continuing operations and before capital items increased by 15.6% to R6.8 billion.</p>
      <p>Diluted headline earnings per share was up 14% to 96.2 cents per share, however, basic earnings per share declined by 22.5% to 64.6 cents – due mainly to an impairment charge related to The Building Company.</p>
      <p>A scrip dividend was declared, with a cash alternative of 20.9 cents per share – down from 27.8 cents in the prior year.</p>
      <p>Pepkor – one of the largest employers in the South African retail sector with 56,100 employees – continued its expansion and opened 338 new stores, expanding the group’s footprint to 5,415 stores.The retailer operates in 12 African countries</p>

      <p>Pepkor said that its FinTech segment increased revenue by 43.9% to R7.2 billion, with operating profit increasing to R483 million.</p>
      <p>It said that the FLASH business continues to report strong growth, completing on average 3.2 million daily transactions with virtual turnover growth exceeding 20%.</p>
      <p>FLASH is a technology-driven company committed to making people’s lives easier. Its hardware and applications offer informal traders an affordable and safe payment system through which to do business in their communities.</p>
      <p>The number of FLASH traders increased to 169,000 from 145,000 last year and the business continues to invest in future growth, Pepkor said.</p>
      <p>Capfin, the group’s loan business, “performed well, appealing to a broader range of customers through its digital channels”.</p>
      <p>“It further successfully established its own internally funded credit book, which remains healthy with credit performance meeting expectations,” Pepkor said.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, Pekor said that the current environment provides opportunities for market share expansion.</p>
      <p>It said it will target new geographies for FLASH – particularly in the informal market.</p>
      <p>“Organic expansion opportunities remain top of mind, including store footprint expansion, the development of new retail formats and the creation of new channels through which to serve our customers.</p>
      <p>“The group will continue to focus on market share expansion and improving operating cost efficiencies.”</p>
