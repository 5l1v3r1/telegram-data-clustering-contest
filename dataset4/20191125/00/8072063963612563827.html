      <p><b>(PAGE SIX) –</b> One of R. Kelly’s two live-in girlfriends, Joycelyn Savage, is singing a different tune now after backing the R&amp;B star through several sexual assault allegations.</p>
      <p>In collaboration with paid platform Patreon, Savage has committed to posting “daily chapters of my story,” according to an Instagram post. That story will include details of her life dating and living with Kelly, 52.</p>
      <p>“There’s something that I need to reveal, something I’ve should’ve talked about a long time ago. This is my story,” wrote Savage in an introductory post, captioning the message, “I’m sorry,” an apology presumably aimed at the “I Believe I Can Fly” singer.</p>
      <p>She continued on a second post, “I have Partnered up with @Patreon where I will post daily chapters of my story. Things I am going to reveal that was sweared not to see the day of light — by NDA. I am risking my life for many others. This story is 18+ and only for mature audience, I want to make sure my story is very detailed as I can remember. My first story “Where It All Started” is out now.</p>
      <p>“Where It All Started” finds Joycelyn recalling when the singer allegedly told her he would make her “the next Aaliyah,” whom Kelly married as a teenager several years before her 2001 passing, TJB reports.</p>
      <p>She also detailed the songwriter’s controlling nature, something several women have stated about the Chicago-born crooner over the years.</p>
      <p>“After these couple of months Robert started giving me commands, and making sure I call him by certain names. Like ‘Master’ or ‘Daddy’ which I didn’t really care for at the time. If I wasn’t getting paid or pursuing my dream I would’ve went home, but all of that didn’t stop just yet. But it started getting worse by day-by-day, he would raise his voice at me if I didn’t call him by those two names. If Robert called me I would have to reply with ‘Yes, daddy’ or ‘Please daddy’ he was so controlling.”</p>
      <p>Savage also claims Kelly would threaten her if she asked to do certain things, such as speak privately to her parents. Timothy Savage, Jocelyn’s father, commented on the post encouraging his daughter — whom he hasn’t spoken to since 2016 — to try reaching out again.</p>
      <p>“If you are having problems please call home or call your Nana or grandma Shirley,” he wrote. Her mother, Jonjelyn, added, “Call Home and Speak with your family that never stopped loving you!”</p>
      <p>Kelly currently faces a slew of child porn and sex-trafficking charges.</p>
