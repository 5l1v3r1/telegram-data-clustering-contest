      <h1>Samsung Galaxy S11e renders leak one day after S11</h1>
      <h2>The smallest S11 might well be an even better buy than this year’s S10e</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:35:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:35</time> by <a rel="author">Henry Burrell</a></address>
      <p>Samsung will very likely launch its flagship Galaxy S11 series in the first few months of 2020, around February or March. We’ve only just seen <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/mobile-phone/samsung-galaxy-s11-render-leaks-note-10-design-3778463/">leaks of the standard S11</a> but reliable tech leaker OnLeaks has now posted what he claims is the smaller, cheaper S11e.</p>
      <p>Posted on tech site <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3778546-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fmobile-phone%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s11e-renders-leak-3778546%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpricebaba.com%2Fblog%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s11e-renders-360-degree-video-exclusive">Pricebaba</a>, the phone looks an awful lot like the alleged S11 including sporting a rectangular camera module that could see Samsung ape the trend set by the iPhone 11 and Pixel 4.</p>
      <p>The phone is rumoured to have a 6.2-6.3in display in a shell that measures 151.7 x 69.1 x 7.9mm and features a central, single front camera cut out much like the design of the Note 10 series. Unlike the S10e that shed a camera on the back compared to the S10 and S10 Plus, this S11e render shows triple rear cameras.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, there is no headphone jack to be seen – an expected move given the Note 10 and Note 10 Plus were the first Samsung flagships to drop them.</p>
      <p>If these leaks are accurate we hope the S11e proves a worthwhile entry into the series that won’t compromise too much. The display looks to be more edge-to-edge than on the S10e, which might mean it does not have a flat screen. It’s also likely to have an in display fingerprint sensor, unlike the S10e that had a physical one on the right edge of the phone.</p>
      <p>The S11e should keep the same Snapdragon 865 chip (yet to be announced) or the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/pc-components/samsung-exynos-990-5g-s11-3776744/">Exynos 990</a> depending on your region, so much like the iPhone 11, the cheapest S11 should be well worth a look. </p>
