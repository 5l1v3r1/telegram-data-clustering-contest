      <p>Senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia on Monday dismissed speculation about his Twitter bio not including his links to the party as "baseless".</p>

      <p>"I had changed it (the Twitter bio) a month ago... I got feedback that it is a long biodata and should be made short. All rumours around it are baseless," Scindia said.</p>
      <p>The buzz started after it was highlighted on social media that his Twitter bio just read "public servant, cricket enthusiast".</p>
      <p>In July, posters had emerged outside the Congress' party office in Bhopal appealing to Rahul Gandhi to appoint Scindia as the next party president.</p>
      <p>The appeal was made on the behalf of all Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee workers.</p>
      <p>The banners came after Scindia had resigned from the post of Congress' general secretary for West Uttar Pradesh after the party put up a poor show in this year's Lok Sabha elections.</p>
      <p>In September, hoardings requesting Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi to "not to come under anyone's pressure" and appoint Scindia as Madhya Pradesh Congress chief had surfaced in Gwalior.</p>
      <p>Notably, Scindia had also backed the Centre's decision to abrogate Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, taking a stand in contrast to that of his party's.</p>
      <p>Last month, Scindia said that Congress needs to self-introspect, echoing the sentiments of his fellow Congressman Salman Khurshid who had expressed concerns over the party's future.</p>
      <p>Scindia had lost from the Guna parliamentary constituency in Madhya Pradesh, his family stronghold, to BJP's Krishna Pal Singh Yadav in this year's general elections.</p>
