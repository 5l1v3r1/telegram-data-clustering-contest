      <h3>Group stage</h3>
      <p>2018 world champion 'Msdossary' from Saudi Arabia and Italy’s 'Crazy' were unbeaten on the opening day and strolled into the knock-out stage.</p>
      <p>'Yago' and 'Lyricz' meanwhile underlined their fine form from the opening FUT Champions Cup of the season, emerging from the group stage with a 4-1 record. Brazil’s 'LucasRep98' and 'SpiderKong' on the other hand were not able to repeat their exploits from the opening event of the season and went out at the first hurdle.</p>
      <h3>Last 16</h3>
      <p>The Round of 16 saw three of Germany’s four Xbox players crash out, namely 'Sakul', 'MegaBit' and 'DullenMike'. 'Fifilza', who was runner-up at the first FUT Champions Cup of the season, had already gone out in the first round and he was followed by 'Yago', who was unable to repeat his good opening-day performance and was knocked out by 'Tuga810'.</p>
      <h3>Quarter-finals</h3>
      <p>The 2018 World Cup winner and 2019 runner-up 'Msdossary' was sent home by 'NR7', while 'Lyricz' was not able to take revenge for his defeat in the FUT Champions Cup at the hands of 'Tekkz'. 'Vini' and 'Gabrielpn' made it a Brazilian double, taking the last two Xbox semi-final berths.</p>
      <p>'Crazy' continued where he had left off in the earlier rounds, putting an end to the hopes of last year’s Grand Finalist 'Maestro', while reigning world champion 'MoAuba' was beaten by 'Paulo Neto'. 'Damie' and 'Harry' completed the PlayStation final four line-up.</p>

      <h3>Semi-finals</h3>
      <p>
        <b>PlayStation:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>'Crazy'</b> 4-1 'Harry'</p>
      <p>The Italian was well and truly on a roll by this point, sending Englishman 'Harry‘ home after a 4-1 defeat. The first leg was a tight affair and ended all square at 1-1, but the second saw 'Crazy' cruise to a 3-0 win which put him into the console final.</p>
      <p><b>'Paulo Neto'</b> 2-0 'Damie'</p>
      <p>'Paulo Neto' was one of three Brazilians in the semi-finals and he duly saw off 'Damie' to reach the decider. New AS Roma recruit 'SpiderKong' had already gone out earlier in the tournament, and it was the end of the line for his team-mate 'Damie' here in the semis.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Xbox:</b>
      </p>
      <p>'<b>NR7</b>' 6-2 'Tekkz'</p>
      <p>The winner of the most recent FUT Champions Cup was looking to defend his title but came up short against 'NR7', who made it into the final courtesy of a performance that had the fans in raptures.</p>
      <p>'<b>Vini</b>' 1-0 'Gabrielpn'</p>
      <p>The Brazilian derby saw 'Vini' from Nethoes E-Sports just get the better of his fellow countryman. Brazil therefore had two of the four finalists across the consoles.</p>
      <h3>Console finals</h3>
      <p><b>'NR7'</b> 2-1 'Vini'</p>
      <p>The German just squeezed past his Brazilian opponent to earn a spot in the Grand Final of the second FUT Champions Cup of the season.</p>
      <p><b>'Crazy'</b> 1-0 'Paulo Neto'</p>
      <p>Things went from bad to worse for Brazil, as 'Paulo Neto' also had to give best to his opponent, with 'Crazy' continuing the form he had shown throughout the tournament to make it into the Grand Final.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Grand Final</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>'NR7'</b> 2-0 'Crazy'</p>
      <p>'Crazy' had arguably been the form player of the tournaments thus far, while 'NR7' had seen off the seemingly unstoppable forces that are 'Msdossary' and 'Tekkz'. The German has been one of the most consistent players of the past few years and it was only fitting that he should win his first international title here.</p>
      <p>Despite 'Crazy' managing an average of 1.7 goals per game – compared with 1.3 for 'NR7' – the Italian had to give best over the two legs, going down 2-0. And so it was that Niklas Raseck ('NR7‘) became the fifth player overall and the second German to hoist the FUT Champions Cup trophy aloft.</p>
