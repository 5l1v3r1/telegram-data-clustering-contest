      <h1>A Wild Leak Might Have Confirmed Rage Against The Machine For Splendour 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:27:29+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:27</time> by <a rel="author">By Cam Tyeson</a></address>
      <p>Now, you can take all of this with as many grains of salt as you like – and honestly, you should probably be taking it with at least a few – but the spicy rumour floating around the traps this morning is that <b>Rage Against The Machine</b>, fresh off of confirming they’re getting the band back together to headline Coachella next year, may or may not have also leaked that they’ll be the headline act at next year’s Splendour In The Grass right here in Australia as well.</p>
      <p>Hold onto something, folks. We’re going down the hole.</p>
      <p>Overnight, a very suspicious looking poster image has been floating around the online, sporting a whole spate of claimed world tour dates for the soon-to-be reunited RATM.</p>
      <p>Among them, a curious slot allotted for Byron Bay, of all places, in late July, of all time. Curious!</p>

      <p>There it is. Right there. Byron Bay, the site of Splendour, on July 18th, right around the exact time when Splendour goes down each and every year.</p>

      <p>The tour poster also includes a date in Melbourne on July 23rd, and a stop in Auckland on July 27th.</p>
      <p>That poster also seemingly confirms the band will be playing Glastonbury in England on June 27th, the same day of the festival that will feature <b>Sir Paul McCartney</b>.</p>
      <p>What gives this a little more weight than other “leaked” tour posters is that this one happened to appear on Rage Against The Machine’s official social media accounts.</p>
      <p>The poster showed up on the RATM Instagram feed at around 11:30pm last night, before it was swiftly deleted a few moments later. Obviously though, not before it was screenshotted and shared around the traps throughout the night.</p>
      <p>Still, it remains to be seen whether this will wind up being legit or not. But good lord. Rage Against The Machine in the amphitheatre? Sign us up, thanks.</p>
