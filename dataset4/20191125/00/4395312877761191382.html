      <p>It already is enough. It is simply a thought that makes you think it needs to be more than what it already is.</p>
      <p>You already are enough. It is simply a thought that makes you think you need to be more than who you already are.</p>
      <p>Simply be here. So you can see it too. Everything that is already here. Everything that has always been here for you too.</p>
      <p>Simply be here. So you can hear it too. The Stillness and the Silence. The Peace and the Calm too.</p>
      <p>Simply be here. So you can feel it too. Feel your own presence. The Presence of You.</p>
      <p>It already is enough. You already are enough too. It is simply a thought that makes you think it needs to be anything other what it already is too.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Sometimes, we can get so caught up in our own heads about thinking it is needs to be something other than what it already is.</p>
      <p>How much brighter can the Sun and Moon be? How much lighter can the sunrise and sunset be? How much mightier can your presence and understanding be?</p>
      <p>Yet we think it needs to be more. Because we learned to think we need to be more too.</p>
      <p>We don’t. You don’t. And I don’t.</p>
      <p>Because you are enough. You have always been enough. Simply being you.</p>
      <p>Your mind simply got conditioned to think you need to be more than you already are.</p>
      <p>Which is how you learned to think you need to keep doing more, wanting more, having more.</p>
      <p>And why there is no end to your thoughts. Why your mind never stops.</p>
      <p>Because there is no more Understanding of Enough. What it means to be enough, have enough, do enough.</p>
      <p>And this is how you break the cycle. From the Understanding. The Understanding of Who You Are. </p>
      <p>And you are enough. You have always been enough. Which is why there is only one you.</p>
      <p>Because no one else can be who you are. No one else can do what only you can do. Be you.</p>
      <p>Begin from this Understanding. So your mind can receive this Understanding too.</p>
      <p>Because when your mind understands, it is settled. So you no longer need to think about it. Because you understand too.</p>
      <p>How you already are enough. How it already is enough too.</p>
