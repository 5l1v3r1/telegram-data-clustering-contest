        <b>GOVERNMENT Senator Matthew Samuda has reiterated his stand that he will not support any delay in the implementation of the second phase of the ban on Styrofoam containers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“I have noted comments from sections of society relating to a request for a delay in the implementation of the second phase of the ban of expanded polystyrene foam, commonly referred to as Styrofoam. I have no intention of supporting any such delay,” Senator Samuda said as he opened the annual State of the Nation debate in the Senate recently.</p>
      <p>Samuda pointed out that in terms of a chronology of the events leading up to the ban, the national discourse on this matter started on Earth Day, April 22, 2016, when he announced, by way of a press release, the intention to pursue that policy path by way of a “Private Members Motion” in the Senate.</p>
      <p>He said that varying levels of market consultations followed, and the motion was passed in September, 2016 with bipartisan support.</p>
      <p>A working group chaired by Dr Paris Lyew Ayee commenced work in February 2017, and the working group submitted a report to the minister without portfolio with responsibility for the environment, Daryl Vaz, which he took to the Cabinet for consideration in September, 2017.</p>
      <p>Samuda recalled that Prime Minister Andrew Holness instructed further consultations be carried out, and the process came to a close in September, 2018 — a year later, with the policy announcement which was followed by the first phase of “expanded polystyrene foam” ban as of January, 2019, with imports also being curtailed.</p>
      <p>“This process is over three years old. The environmental challenges faced by the nation are three years more mature and harder to correct,” he cautioned.</p>
      <p>He said, however, that while he would not resume debating the reasons for the ban, he felt that it was important to make the point from the United Nations Environment Programme “state of plastics” report of 2018, which stated that expanded polystyrene foam contains carcinogens and the biodegradability expectation was now listed as 1,000 years.</p>
      <p>“Anything but implementing the policy in line with the dates previously determined would be a retrograde step. This Government has displayed clearly, an unparalleled commitment to environmental protection and shouldn't backslide,” Senator Samuda said.</p>
      <p>“Furthermore, the major player/s in the Styrofoam market have awesome distribution capacity. It is incumbent on them to use this capacity for the good of the nation, in ensuring maximum compliance is achieved in the fastest possible time for the good of the nation,” he added.</p>
      <p>The <b>Jamaica Observer</b> had reported earlier this month that a group of local business operators had written to the Government asking for an extension of the timeline for the manufacture and distribution of polystyrene foam, for use as finished goods in the food and beverage industry in Jamaica.</p>
