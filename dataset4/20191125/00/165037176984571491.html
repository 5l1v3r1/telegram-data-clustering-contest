        <b>Juan Miranda is having a complicated year at Schalke 04. He is on loan from Barcelona and hasn't even played for them. Barca plan to recall him, but Juventus want to sign him. According to 'La Gazzetta dello Sport', Juve have reactivated their interest in the Spanish fullback.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona">Barcelona</a> could recall Juan Miranda in January due to the complicated situation he is experiencing at Schalke. The fullback was loaned to the German club to get game time, but he hasn't even played for them.</p>
      <p>It was recently made known that Barca were planning to recall the player and loan him to Mallorca, but his future might not necessarily lie in Spain.</p>
