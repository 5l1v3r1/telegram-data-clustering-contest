      <h1>Chinese Rocket Launch Covers Village in Toxic Debris. Again.</h1>

      <h3>Deadly Debris</h3>
      <p>On Saturday, China’s space agency <a href="https://www.space.com/chinese-rocket-launch-drops-debris-on-homes.html">launched a Long March 3B rocket</a> from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center.</p>
      <p>The mission was a success in that it resulted in the delivery of two satellites into orbit. But when the rocket’s first stage booster returned to Earth, it landed on a populated area, <i>Ars Technica</i> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/china-keeps-dropping-toxic-rocket-parts-on-its-villages/">reported</a>, destroying a building and blanketing the area in toxic smoke — a space-age environmental catastrophe China could easily have prevented.</p>

      <h3>Location, Location, Location</h3>
      <p>The United States and many other space-faring nations typically build their launch sites near coasts. That’s specifically so they can avoid putting the lives of residents at risk — any debris that returns to Earth can just fall into the ocean downrange.</p>
      <p>But during the Cold War, China built several major launch centers inland for “security purposes,” <i>Ars Technica</i> pointed out.</p>
      <p>In the decades since, missions from those sites have repeatedly put residents in harm’s way — in 1996, one Chinese rocket crashed into a village shortly after launch, killing either six people or hundreds, depending on whether you believe China or <a href="https://www.thespacereview.com/article/2323/1">outside sources</a>.</p>
      <h3>Trading Live</h3>
      <p>China could slow its space efforts while building new launch sites in unpopulated or coastal areas.</p>
      <p>But instead, it has actually <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/china-launches-more-orbital-rockets">increased its number of rocket launches</a> in recent years in pursuit of space domination — a distinction it clearly sees as being worth the lives of its own residents.</p>
