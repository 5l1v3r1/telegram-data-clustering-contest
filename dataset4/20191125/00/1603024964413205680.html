      <p>Pawar also attended a 'bhajan' ceremony organised as a mark of respect to the late Congress stalwart.</p>
      <p>The NCP chief is expected to attend a couple of other events also in Karad during the day.</p>
      <p>Notably, NCP leader Ajit Pawar, who is currently in the spotlight after rebelling against his party and supporting the BJP to form government in Maharashtra, sat on a day-long fast at Chavan's memorial in April 2013 for some of his remarks on the then drought situation in the state.</p>
