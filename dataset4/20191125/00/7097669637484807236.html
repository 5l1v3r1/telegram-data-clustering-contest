      <h1>The president must have the final say</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:51:25+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.usatoday.com/opinion/" target="_blank">David Gurfein, Opinion contributor</a></address>
      <p>The U.S. military is the most powerful and effective fighting force the world has ever seen. It is, in part, because of the good order and discipline maintained throughout the ranks.</p>
      <p>For nearly 250 years, Americans who serve our country have defended our Constitution and our rights. They have never faltered.</p>
      <p>However, recently, a few of our warriors have come under attack. Not from a foreign invader or terrorist, but from people within their own command.</p>
      <p>When President Donald Trump pardoned two servicemen and restored the rank of a third — righting the wrongs of unlawful command influence, prosecutorial misconduct and investigator abuse — reports of dissent from a few senior officers and civilians at the Pentagon flooded the airwaves.</p>
      <p>As officers in the U.S. military, we are trained that we do not have a responsibility to dissent, we have an obligation to dissent. Acting courageously to challenge senior leadership on their ideas and plans is healthy and helps to ensure the best possible outcome, whether in combat or in garrison. However, that dissent must end once a decision is made. </p>
      <p>
        <b>OUR VIEW: </b>
        <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/11/24/trumps-harmful-meddling-gallagher-case/4290419002/">Do Navy leaders have a 'duty to disobey' Trump in Gallagher case?</a>
      </p>
      <p>Continuing to debate, complain or act in defiance undermines good order and discipline far worse than any single decision, especially a decision made by the president to rectify the disgraceful actions demonstrated by the Army and the Navy JAG Corps and their criminal investigators.</p>
      <p>America’s Founders structured our military so that it would protect the peoples’ rights by having each member swear to defend our Constitution and answer to a civilian leader who would be elected by the people. As such, when there are disagreements between our military leaders and our civilian leaders, the president, as commander in chief, must have the final say.</p>
      <p>Our military leaders may not like the president’s orders. However, they must obey them. Moreover, they must obey them enthusiastically as if they were their own. Anything short of that is considered, at best, insubordination and, at worst, treason. </p>
