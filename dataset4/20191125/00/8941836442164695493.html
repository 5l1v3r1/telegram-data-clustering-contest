      <p>KLAMATH FALLS, Ore. (AP) - The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/trust-for-public/">Trust for Public</a> Lands has received more than $400,000 in grant money toward the purchase of Spence Mountain.</p>
      <p>The Herald and News reported Monday that the trust is trying to gather $6 million to purchase the 7,500-acre property from private landowners so it can be managed by Klamath County.</p>
      <p>Spence Mountain is the last block of privately owned land on the west side of Klamath Lake and holds six strategically important lands for fish and wildlife.</p>
      <p>There are also 35 miles of mountain bike trails, with plans to expand to 65 miles in the future.</p>
      <p>The recent grant was from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.</p>
