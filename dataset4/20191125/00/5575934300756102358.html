      <p>Noice.</p>
      <p>Global businesswoman Kim Kardashian West has teamed up with beloved Aussie character Sharon Strzelecki for a new Uber Eats ad.</p>
      <p>Strzelecki, who is played by comedian Magda Szubanski, graced our screens as a netball fanatic on the TV series “Kath and Kim” but this time she’s hanging out with a different “Kim”.</p>
      <p>As part of the latest rendition of Uber Eats’ “Tonight I’ll be Eating” ad campaign, Strzelecki says she’ll be eating pesto gnocchi and garlic bread to keep her “carbed up” while Kardashian West orders an Aussie favourite – a chicken schnitty with chips and chicken salt.</p>
      <p>Kardashian West even dons her own version of a netball uniform, with her initials KKW emblazoned on the front.</p>
      <p>While waiting for their orders, Strzelecki also teaches Kardashian West how to pronounce ‘noice’.</p>

      <p>With a slew of beauty products to her name and more than 150 million followers on Instagram, Uber said Kardashian West’s “cultural appeal is undeniable”.</p>
      <p>“She’s a once in a generation influencer, while Sharon is the perfect Australian voice and comedic foil to the glamorous Californian,” <a href="https://www.uber.com/en-AU/newsroom/kimkardashianwest/">Uber said in a statement.</a></p>
      <p>Previous campaign ads featured other Australian and global celebrities including Rebel Wilson, Ruby Rose, Naomi Watts and Rafael Nadal.</p>
      <p>Uber called “Sharon and Kim” it’s “most audacious, quirky and unexpected pairing yet.”</p>
      <p>“With creative pairings like Sharon and Kim, small businesses are able to unlock the star power of international and homegrown talent to promote their restaurants,” Uber said.</p>
      <p>The ad was by and large very well received on social media:</p>
