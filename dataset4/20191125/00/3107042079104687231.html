      <p>Police have charged a 43-year-old Christchurch man with allegedly burgling two building sites.</p>
      <p>The burglaries took place at the new subdivision near Townsend Rd in Rangiora about 10.30pm on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Police said the man went to the building sites and loaded up his van with landscaping equipment from one site before removing a trailer from the neighbouring site.</p>
      <p>Once the burglaries were discovered, police were led to the alleged offender's address by a GPS tracking device on the stolen property.</p>
      <p>The vehicle involved was also identified through surveillance cameras set up by one of the builders.</p>
      <p>Police were able to return the stolen property.</p>
      <p>The alleged offender was due to appear in the Christchurch District Court on Monday.</p>
      <p>Police are also reminding people to take precautions against being burgled. To avoid it happening to you, they recommend:</p>
      <p>• Preventing easy access or an opportunity to potential burglars.<br/>• Engraving your tools.<br/>• Locking and securing premises.<br/>• Using available technology to alarm and monitor your property.<br/>• Placing tracking devices on valuable items.</p>
