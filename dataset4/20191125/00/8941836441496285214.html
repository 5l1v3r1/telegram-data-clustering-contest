      <p>MINSK, Belarus (AP) - Diego Maradona has sent congratulations in Russian after a team he backs in Belarus won the national title.</p>
      <p>Maradona is honorary chairman of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dinamo-brest/">Dinamo Brest</a>, which beat Vitebsk 1-0 on Sunday to open up a five-point lead with one game remaining, ending a run of 13 titles for BATE Borisov.</p>
      <p>Maradona writes on Instagram in Spanish that “I am very happy to congratulate the players, fans, administrators and coaching staff” after the win, adding in Russian: “My congratulations.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dinamo-brest/">Dinamo</a> announced Maradona as chairman in May 2018 on a three-year deal, initially saying he would be in charge of “strategic development,” but his involvement has been largely nominal.</p>
      <p>The former Argentina player and coach visited the city of Brest in July 2018 and rode on an armored vehicle, and then took a coaching job in Mexico two months later.</p>
