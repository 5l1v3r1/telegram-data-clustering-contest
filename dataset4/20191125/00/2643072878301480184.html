      <h3>Political Group Chides Jonathan Over Bayelsa Election Result</h3>
      <p>Former President <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/goodluck-jonathan/"><u>Goodluck Jonathan</u></a></b> has been accused of betraying the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the last governorship election in Bayelsa State.</p>
      <p>A group, <b>People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Elders Forum</b> said it was worried about the open fraternization of Jonathan with the <b>All Progressives Congress</b> (APC) during the election.</p>
      <p>The group in a statement issued by its Chairman <b>Chief Benson Odoko</b> in Yenagoa lamented that the former president abandoned the PDP which made him Deputy Governor, Governor, Vice President and President of the country to support the APC.</p>
      <p>He also recalled that <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/10/10/just-in-buhari-jonathan-in-closed-door-meeting-in-aso-rock/"><u>Jonathan who visited President Muhammadu Buhari</u></a></b> at the Presidential Villa in Abuja just before the election refused to state the reason for the visit.</p>
      <p>Odoko further raised eyebrows over Jonathan’s decision to keep his distance from the PDP and its members throughout the period of the campaigns leading to the November 16 election in Bayelsa State.</p>
      <p>Odoko stated that the Forum was shocked when Jonathan and his wife donated the Aridolf Hotel to the APC as the operational contact point for visiting dignitaries of the party and as the venue for the party’s controversial primaries.</p>
      <p>He added that <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/bayelsa-apc-governors-visit-ex-president-goodluck-jonathan-photos/"><u>the visit to President Jonathan by APC leaders</u></a></b> shortly after the charade called election and another visit by the leader of the APC in the state, Chief Timipre Sylva, the candidate of the APC in the election, Chief David Lyon, and others to the Jonathans clearly portrayed the former president as having betrayed the PDP which gave him the platform to occupy the highest positions in the country, Bayelsa State, and millions of PDP members just to protect his selfish interest.</p>
      <p>He said Jonathan did this because his preferred candidate, <b>Chief Timi Alaibe</b>, lost in the primaries.</p>
      <p>Odoko, therefore, called on the national leadership of the PDP to invoke disciplinary action against Jonathan for working against his party and openly celebrating an opposition victory against the party which made him president.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> recalls <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/inec-declares-apcs-david-lyon-winner-of-bayelsa-election/"><u>David Lyon of the All Progressives Congress</u></a></b> (APC) was declared by INEC as the winner of the election but the PDP had insisted the polls were rigged and have vowed to challenge the results at the tribunal.</p>
