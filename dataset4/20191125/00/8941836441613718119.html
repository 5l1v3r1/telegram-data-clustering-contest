      <p>FAYETTEVILLE, W.Va. (AP) - West Virginia sportsmen’s groups say they are not happy they could lose about 4,800 acres (1,940 hectares) of hunting land if the New River Gorge National River is designated a national park and preserve.</p>
      <p>The Register-Herald reports the proposal by U.S. Sens. Shelley Moore Capito and Joe Manchin would designate about 64,000 (25,900 hectares) acres as a national preserve, with hunting and fishing allowed.</p>
      <p>The National Park area would consist of a little less than 8,000 acres, with hunting restricted. Some of that land already has hunting restrictions but more than half does not.</p>
      <p>West Virginia Wildlife Federation President Jerod Harmon tells the paper they will not support additional restrictions on hunters, anglers or trappers.</p>
