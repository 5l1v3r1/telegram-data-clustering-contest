      <p>Acclaimed contemporary artist David Rickard returns to his home town of Ashburton for his first ever solo exhibition later this month.</p>
      <p>Echoes from the Sound Barrier will bring together a number of recent works, including several pieces created in New Zealand prior to the exhibition.</p>
      <p>The exhibition at Ashburton Art Gallery ranges from sculpture to performance, film, photography and sound.</p>
      <p>Rickard was born and raised in Ashburton and attended Ashburton College before studying architecture at Auckland School of Architecture.</p>
      <p>He then went on to study fine art at Academia di Brera, Milan and Central Saint Martins in London.</p>
      <p>Now based in London, he works widely with institutions and galleries throughout Europe.</p>
      <p>Ashburton Art Gallery manager/curator Shirin Khosraviani said the gallery was thrilled to be working with an artist of Rickard's calibre and excited to see how the local community responded to his contemporary and conceptual practice.</p>
      <p>The artist uses research and experimentation to attempt to understand how we arrived at our perception of the physical world and how far our perception is from what we call reality.</p>
      <p>"There is often a big difference between what we think we see and what actually exists,'' Mr Rickard said.</p>
      <p>Visitors will be welcomed into the foyer with a new work Aweigh, which will span the double-height space and features anchors from Greymouth, New Zealand and Porto Vigo, Spain.</p>
      <p>The anchors form a direct bond that introduces the concepts of place, journey, and gravity.</p>
      <p>Main gallery works include Distant Rhythm, which takes the form of a pair of drum sticks, hand carved from a mangrove tree in Kopu, New Zealand and an olive tree in Algaidas, Spain.</p>
      <p>David Rickard's exhibition opens with an artist talk at 6pm on November 27. It runs until February 20.</p>
