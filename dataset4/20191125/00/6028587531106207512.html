      <p>Black Friday is upon us, namely because Black Friday in 2019 means more or less two weeks of sales rather than one single day of scrambling. Most of the deals for the holiday are either publicly posted or live right now, and that includes a number of deals for the Xbox One in all its various forms.Xbox One has one year left in its official lifespan before Xbox Scarlett arrives this fall. That means these are probably some of the best deals and lowest prices you will see for the console, possibly ever, short of buying used units. So, which outlet should you get it from? A few of them have the same bundles, but there are a few different options to choose from here.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Best Buy</b>
      </p>

      <p>Yeah, you’re really not going to find much cheaper than a $150 Xbox, so this is a great deal if you don’t care about using discs to play games, as this console is all-digital.</p>

      <p>Jedi: Fallen Order is quickly turning into a Game of the Year contender, and it’s a must-play for any Star Wars fan. This is a bundle that saves you $150 off an Xbox One X, the more powerful version of the console, which I would probably recommend give the massive improvements you’ll see over the S. Just make sure you have a 4K TV to take advantage.</p>

      <p>Another cheap bundle for the Xbox One X, but this time you are subbing in the acclaimed Gears of Wars 5 as your free bundled game, which has debuted to pretty stellar reviews across the board, particularly for its innovative campaign.</p>

      <p>Another Fallen Order bundle, but this time with an Xbox One S that does actually have a disc drive, so if you just want to play the game and don’t care about the extra $150 for the X’s power, here you go.</p>
      <p>
        <b>GameStop</b>
      </p>
      <related>
        <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=zmNbNw6aNM4&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=11252019blackfridayPaulTassi&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-one%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-one-x-nba-2k20-special-edition-1tb-bundle-only-at-gamestop%2F11095798.html"/>

      <p>Here’s a “limited edition” X bundle with NBA 2K20 if you’d rather have a sports game instead of the others. GameStop also has the Fallen Order S and all-digital S bundles from above if you’d rather spend some store credit there.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Walmart</b>
      </p>
      <related>
        <a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/1201867/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-One-S-1TB-Forza-Horizon-4-Bundle-White-234-00552%2F654831970&amp;subId1=11252019blackfridayPaulTassi"/>

      <p>Walmart has like pretty much all of the above bundles for sale as well, so you can pick those up here if this is where you end up shopping on Black Friday. I’ve just spotlighted this Forza one, as that’s one of the best Xbox One games out there.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Amazon</b>
      </p>
      <related>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-All-Digital-Console-Disc-free-Gaming/dp/B07XQXZXJC?ref_=Oct_BSellerC_6469295011_0&amp;pf_rd_p=c1f6314a-565f-515f-97a7-acdaf4759134&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-6&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_i=6469295011&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=F5BSHMDJRMMACG1S09A5&amp;pf_rd_r=F5BSHMDJRMMACG1S09A5&amp;pf_rd_p=c1f6314a-565f-515f-97a7-acdaf4759134"/>

      <p>We end where we began, the all-digital Xbox One S which comes with Sea of Thieves, Minecraft and Fortnite (which is already free). Amazon lists this as their #1 best seller in the Xbox category, followed by the two Fallen Order bundles.</p>
      <p>Happy hunting. Buy online, going to stores is just going to be exhausting.</p>
