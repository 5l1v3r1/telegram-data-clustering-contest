      <h1>Jose Mourinho Told by Referee Not to Wear Amazon Microphone During First Spurs Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/1719980" target="_blank">Jamie Spencer</a></address>
      <p>​Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho had wanted to wear a microphone during his pre-match meeting with referee Michael Oliver and then on the touchline during the game itself for his first match in charge against West Ham on Saturday – but was told that it would not be viable.</p>
      <p>Mourinho took over from Mauricio Pochettino in a shock switch just days before the game, with Spurs in the midst of filming a new behind the scenes documentary with Amazon Prime.</p>

      <p>Such documentary series have become hugely popular in recent seasons. According to <a href="https://theathletic.com/1395237/2019/11/25/joking-about-his-uniform-blocked-from-wearing-an-amazon-mic-and-applauding-overhit-passes-inside-mourinhos-first-week-at-spurs/?source=shared-article">The Athletic</a>, Mourinho initially had a microphone attached when he entered the referees’ room for the pre-match captain’s briefing at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>It was during this exchange that he is said to have checked with Oliver if he would be permitted to wear the microphone during the game. The referee told him no, suggesting it would not be appropriate to do so.</p>
      <p>On top of that, The Athletic revealed that the Premier League also intervened over concerns it would be unfair should he then get into any sort of dispute on the sidelines. Presumably, the issue of fairness is that any conversation would be recorded when it wouldn’t usually be.</p>
      <p>There is even a suggestion that money played a part in it, given that the documentary deal is between Spurs and Amazon. Wearing a microphone to pick up comments during games could bring people from other clubs into the mix.</p>

      <p>On his return to the Premier League, just under a year after being sacked by <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-united">Manchester United</a>, Mourinho saw his new Spurs side race into a 3-0 lead against West Ham inside 49 minutes. Only two late goals conceded took the sheen off an otherwise important victory.</p>
      <p>Harry Kane is already hopeful that Spurs can win trophies under Mourinho.</p>
      <p>“The gaffer’s won at every club he’s gone to - there’s no hiding away from that,” Kane is quoted as saying by <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50538931">BBC Sport</a>. “I’ve made it clear that I’m at the stage of my career where I want to win trophies. I’ve made it clear I want to win them here and it’s a big year for us.”</p>
