      <p>Dubbed the biggest fintech start-up in Finland by Helsinki Fintech Farm – a resource for Finnish fintech activity, the 2016-founded company is now working with the likes of MasterCard, Visa and Amazon Web Services (AWS) to develop its new service.</p>
      <p>“Our goal is to help consumers become more carbon conscious, which is why we wanted to create a product that gives individuals accurate feedback based on their actual purchase history and lifestyle,” says Enfuce co-founder Monika Liikamaa.</p>
      <p>“Only by bringing individualised and systematic insights can we help consumers make sustainable choices a habit.”</p>
      <p>Enfuce’s new service helps banks to track and calculate the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions of every purchase made by their consumers, which then in turn provides insights into each person’s climate change impact.</p>
