        <b>Zinedine Zidane spoke in the pre-match press conference before Real Madrid's match with PSG. The Frenchman spoke about his team's situation and the ins and outs of a busy week at the Bernabeu.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Zinedine Zidane analysed the moment in which <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a> come into the match against Paris Saint-Germain. After getting a few wins, <b>the atmosphere at the Bernabeu seemed different </b>to that of a month back, before playing against Galatasaray, although the French coach is not getting carried away. </p>
      <p><b>"I know feelings can change again</b>. It depends on our capacity to play good matches, play well, not concede. We know what we must do and personally,<b> I'm happy because I think my team is better now,</b>" Zidane commented. </p>
      <p>Ahead of him, a PSG side who arrive as always, with plenty to talk about. Questioned on whether he likes Neymar or <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/k-mbappe-lottin-234474/">Mbappe</a> more,<b> he did not give his opinion</b>. "I'm not going to choose because tomorrow those who are going to play will play. They are all ready and we will see. We are all ready and<b> we are going to go with the best players</b>. </p>
      <p><b>He did not want to give more details on Mbappe</b>: "Nothing, Mbappe comes tomorrow as a rival. What most bothers me is what we will do, we will see what they do. <b>We know the player that he is</b>, the importance in to his team and that is."</p>
      <p>On the rumours of Neymar being on the bench, Zidane is not reading too much into that: "Honestly, <b>for me it doesn't change anything</b> because I think Neymar is going to play and so is Mbappe, so that doesn't change anything. We are ready to play against any team and against any player. <b>PSG are having a magnificent season</b> and we are going to see a great match."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/g-bale-72/">Gareth Bale</a><b> trained again with Real Madrid</b> after returning from his controversial return for Wales. On the footballer's situation, Zidane treated it normally: "<b>You have to ask Bale directly</b>. He is with us and he is ready to play a game of football."</p>
