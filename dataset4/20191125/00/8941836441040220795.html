      <p>ROME (AP) - Officially say at least five people died as heavy rain slammed the Riviera coasts of France and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/italy/">Italy</a>, trapping travelers in their cars.</p>
      <p>Some roads remained closed Monday on the French Riviera, and rivers are still rising in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/italy/">Italy</a> after the weekend flooding.</p>
      <p>The administration for France’s Var region said four people died, including a couple in their 70s from the perfume capital of Grasse whose car got submerged. Another died after a French rescue boat sank in the Mediterranean and another was found dead in a car.</p>
