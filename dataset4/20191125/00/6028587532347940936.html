      <p>When does a simple set of dice capture the interest of an entire community?The<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dispeldice/dispel-dice"> current Kickstarter campaign</a> for Dispel Dice has done just that, with a fully funded campaign of $20,000 in only 2 minutes. It is currently running at well over $2M and nearly 18,000 backers.</p>

      <p>I sat down with Karen Wang, a fledgling dice maker, to discuss the success of the campaign and what got her into Dungeons &amp; Dragons, dice and future creative plans.</p>
      <p><b>Goldie Chan:</b> How long have you played <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/goldiechan/2018/12/11/8-leadership-lessons-dnd/#51fd495e7015">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>? </p>
      <p><b>Karen Wang:</b> I started pretty recently a little less than three years ago with 3.5, and moved to 5th edition. I’m currently in 4 campaigns, though I’ve had to reduce the frequency of our sessions to focus on Dispel Dice. I’ve been itching to start another campaign at the request of some close friends, but that’ll probably have to wait a bit!</p>

      <p><b>Chan:</b> How did you first <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/goldiechan/2019/08/19/3-storytelling-rules-dnd/">discover D&amp;D</a>?</p>
      <p><b>Wang: </b>This is somewhat personal, but it’s also a critical part of what became the foundation for Dispel Dice. I was going through a difficult time in my life; my interpersonal relationships were suffering, I wasn’t sure where my career was going - I honestly just didn’t know what I wanted to do.</p>
      <p>I was lucky enough to have people in my life that loved and supported me, even though I couldn’t feel it at the time, and I kept canceling on friends who tried to invite me out.</p>
      <p>Finally, it was my friend Derek’s birthday, and he invited me to play D&amp;D. Everyone in our group was new to it except our DM, Colin. I had canceled on Derek a few times already, so I was determined to make it this time. When we started playing, I found myself having fun for the first time in a <i>long </i>time.I didn’t know anything about D&amp;D, and I wasn’t even familiar with half the people at the table that day, but through that single event, my life changed forever. We started playing once a month for 12 hour+ sessions, seeing each other at holidays and birthdays — D&amp;D formed the basis for a community that helped me through one of the most difficult times in my life, and eventually inspired me to start Dispel Dice.</p>

      <p><b>Chan: </b>Why did you want to make dice?</p>
      <p><b>Wang: </b>I’ve always liked making things, and I really wanted to contribute back to D&amp;D in some way, but I wasn’t skilled enough to DM at that time. I also wanted dice that just didn’t exist yet, so I realized I’d have to make them. It turned out to be such a joy, I started casting multiple times a day. It quickly became an obsession - I lost a <b><i>lot</i></b> of sleep staying up casting dice for months on end.</p>
      <p><b>Chan: </b>What inspires the themes of your dice - what is the story behind the different sets?</p>
      <p><b>Wang:</b> I look to different laterals a lot. Nail polish, resin art, fashion, and nature come to mind as inspiration. In nature specifically, I love the ocean and the stars, so they often find their way into my designs. To me, space and the ocean are these incredible frontiers that evoke a sense of adventure and wonder similar to the one I feel when I play D&amp;D.</p>

      <p><b>Chan: </b>Now that you've reached way past your goals on this Kickstarter campaign do you have bigger creative plans?</p>
      <p><b>Wang:</b> I am 100% focused on fulfilling my Kickstarter at the moment, but I do have dreams for what after might look like. I love creating, and I’m a big board game and fantasy fan, so I’d love to see what else I can offer in this space.</p>
      <p>If you are interested in supporting this nascent dice creator, check out the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dispeldice/dispel-dice">on-going Kickstarter campaign</a> with less than two weeks left. Overall, this particular Kickstarter campaign is a brilliant case study in giving a demographic what they want - by being a part of the community itself.</p>
