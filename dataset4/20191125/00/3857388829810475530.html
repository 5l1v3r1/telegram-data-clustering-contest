      <p>The death toll from West Pokot landslides in Kenya has risen to 52 after six more bodies were recovered at Parua area.</p>
      <p>At least 22 other people are missing after the tragedy that hit Parua, Nyarkulian and Muino, according to Governor John Lonyangapuo.</p>
      <p>Prof Lonyangapuo on Monday told journalists that search and rescue mission was still underway.</p>
      <p>The efforts to find and pull more bodies out of mud have been hampered by lack of transport because the roads heading to the area are either impassable or non-existent.</p>
      <p>He said 22,000 homesteads and between 80,000-120,000 people have been displaced or affected by the landslides.</p>
      <p>The county, the governor said, has run out of medicines after the remaining stocks were sent to dispensaries and schools caring for the displaced.</p>
