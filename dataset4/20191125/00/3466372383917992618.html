      <p>"The three MLAs -- Daulat Daroda (from Shahapur seat), Nitin Pawar (Kalwan) and Narhari Zirwal (Dindori) -- have come back," an NCP leader said.</p>
      <p>After returning, Nitin Pawar said he supports the Sharad Pawar-led party and revealed that they were taken to Delhi.</p>
      <p>"We were taken to New Delhi, but soon we realised what has happened. We contacted our senior leaders, including Sharad Pawar, Supriya Sule and Jayant Patil and informed them that we are with them," he told reporters in Mumbai.</p>
      <p>NCP's chief spokesperson Nawab Malik said that 52 MLAs have come back to Sharad Pawar-led party.</p>
      <p>"52 MLAs of the party have come back to us, one more is in touch with us," Malik told <i>ANI</i>.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Malik claimed that the three MLAs were flown to Delhi in a chartered plane by the BJP on Saturday after they attended Ajit Pawar's swearing-in.</p>
      <p>The three MLAs have stated that they are with the party, Malik added.</p>
      <p>The NCP won 54 seats in the Maharashtra assembly elections held last month.</p>
