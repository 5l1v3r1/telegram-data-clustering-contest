      <p>Clinical social worker, educator, and researcher Caitlin Ryan has centered her more than four-decade career on improving LGBT health and healthcare. In fact, in the 1970’s, Ryan played a large role in establishing LGBT health as a field that was even worthy of research and recognition. Fighting bigotry and homophobia every step of the way, she published the first national directory of LGBT health services, created the first national lesbian health survey, and, while in clinical training in Atlanta, co-founded AID Atlanta to provide support to LGBT people during the AIDS epidemic.</p>
      <p>It was during this time at AID Atlanta that Ryan’s life’s work truly began. She remembers the heartbreak of meeting the parents of young men with AIDS. “LGBT people from conservative social worlds would leave their communities to go to a larger city so they wouldn’t shame their parents and could live a more open life,” Ryan explains. “It was really common in the days of the AIDS epidemic…I would meet these parents and most of them did not know when they came that their son was gay or bisexual and was dying of AIDS. So I’d meet them at the bedsides of their children, and I saw something that most people never really saw. I saw the devastation of those parents.”</p>
      <p>Ryan says there is a huge misconception that all parents around that time were rejecting of their children. “I saw there was another side to these experiences, and if we could find a way to help families support their LGBT children, maybe we could prevent the situation from happening. I knew we needed to do something; we needed rigorous research.”</p>
      <p>So, in 2002 Ryan launched the Family Acceptance Project, the first organization focused on studying the families of LGBT youth. Ryan wanted to find out if it was possible to transform a family from being rejecting to being accepting. The answer: a resounding yes.</p>
      <p>Ryan and her team went into the homes of families with LGBT children and interviewed them to identify over one hundred accepting and rejecting behaviors that they exhibited. “In follow up research, we could measure that and show how those behaviors could contribute to risk and well-being. In essence we created a new language, a behavioral language people hadn’t seen before.”</p>
      <p>The more rejecting behaviors youth experienced, Ryan found, the more likely they were to attempt suicide. The more accepting behaviors they experienced, the better their health and well being. </p>
      <p>“That research included developing the first evidence-based family support model that could help diverse families learn to support their LGBT children,” Ryan says. “Even if they thought being gay or trans was wrong.”</p>
      <p>FAP has since trained and educated 92,000 families, religious leaders, and care providers from around the world. “We’ve found families can learn to support their LGBT children when we present information in a way that resonates for them. So our work is culture-based, faith-based.”</p>
      <p>According to Ryan, parents can best learn to support their children if it is in the context of their own beliefs. “They really think they are helping their children when they isolate them or try to change them or do some of the rejecting behaviors. We can show them that they don’t have to agree that being gay or trans is okay, but that there are behaviors they can do to not commit harm to their child. They burst into tears when they find out it’s these behaviors that are so hurtful.”</p>
      <p>Recently, FAP has released a series of posters that identify the major accepting and rejecting behaviors that family members exhibit. Accepting behaviors include things like speaking openly about your child’s identity and bringing your child to LGBT events. Rejecting behaviors include blaming your child for being mistreated by others due to their identity and pressuring your child to be more masculine or feminine.</p>
      <p>These posters, of which there are multiple versions in different sizes and languages, are designed to be hung in libraries, community centers, pediatrician’s offices, and the like. They are meant to act as guides to anyone who interacts with children, but they are also meant to speak to LGBT children directly, to act as indicators for how they deserve to be treated and also to signal to them that if they are acting out or feeling depressed, it isn’t their fault.</p>
      <p>Right now, Ryan’s biggest hope is to spread her work as far and wide as she can. She wants to see her posters everywhere. “It would be my dream to go down to a small town in Mississippi and see that in a public library,” she says.</p>
      <p>Ryan says things have definitely gotten better since she started her work. She believes one major reason for that is the increase in positive media images of LGBT adults. There are no longer only images of distress and disease associated with the LGBTQ community. Now, there is proof that LGBT children can grow up to be happy, healthy, successful adults, which makes parents less worried about accepting their children’s identities.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Ryan says the world still desperately lacks services that teach parents how to support their LGBT children. “We now know a child of 3 has a sense of their gender identity. Children increasingly identify as gay in childhood. [Heterosexual and cisgender] parents don’t know what that means, many of them are at a loss and they may be using info that came from decades ago about adults to try to help those children.”</p>
      <p>We must start thinking about gender and sexuality as a normal part of child development, she says. She believes pediatricians should start as early as possible teaching parents of infants about sexual orientation and gender identity.</p>
      <p>Despite the challenges, Ryan remains optimistic. “This is really the most hopeful work I’ve ever done. It’s so incredibly exciting to be able to show socially conservative and religious families that your beliefs may tell you that your wrong to be gay or trans, but these are the outcomes when you respond in these ways, and you can support your child and keep your family together and prevent these outcomes.”</p>
