      <h1>Here’s Elon Musk’s Excuse For Smashing Cybertruck Window</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Victor Tangermann</a></address>
      <h3>Smashed</h3>
      <p>It was an embarrassing moment.</p>
      <p>At Tesla’s reveal event for its <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/tesla-elon-musk-unveils-blade-runner-cybertruck">newly-announced</a> Cybertruck, chief designer Franz von Holzhausen tried to show off what the <a href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck">company calls</a> “Tesla armor glass” — but the hefty metal ball he threw at the window <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/tesla-shows-off-bulletproof-cybertruck-breaks-window">smashed it in front of a live audience</a>, prompting ridicule across the web.</p>
      <h3>20/20 Hindsight</h3>
      <p>In a Sunday afternoon tweetstorm, Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198772995021406209">explained</a> that the “sledgehammer impact on door” from a preceding stunt “cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn’t bounce off.”</p>
      <p>“Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198772995021406209">added</a>. “Next time…”</p>
      <h3>Part Count</h3>
      <p>We already knew that the glass was made to be pretty tough. Minutes before the accident, a group of leather overcoat-clad stage assistants demonstrated that Tesla’s glass could withstand the same metal ball dropping onto its surface from a height of roughly 15 feet.</p>
      <p>Musk also revealed on Twitter that his company received more than <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198788116372344832">200,000 pre-orders</a> for the unusual truck.</p>
      <p>“New manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then I’m confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity &amp; lower part count,” <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198708228474884096">Musk tweeted</a>.</p>
