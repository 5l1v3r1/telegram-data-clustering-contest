      <p>A Kildare man sang his heart out with Scottish pop star Lewis Capaldi at the weekend after he asked him if he could sing with him on his birthday.</p>
      <p>Sean McGrath, 24, took to the Olympia Theatre stage on Thursday night beside the star and stunned the crowd with his voice on the hit song 'Bruises'.</p>
      <p>He had been in the front row when he caught the singer's eye and asked if he could sing with him adding that it was his birthday.</p>
      <p>Before they began, Capaldi told Sean: "I'll sing the first line and then it's all yours man."</p>
      <p>The Naas native stepped up to sing with the band and the crowd went wild.</p>
      <p>McGrath, who is the lead singer in a band called Stolen City, said he was very worried that he would mess it up as he is a huge fan but decided to embrace it and enjoyed it once he went up on stage.</p>
      <p>The video of Sean's performance has gone viral on social media.</p>
