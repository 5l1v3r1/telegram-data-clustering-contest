      <p>NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) - Armel Potter had 22 points, including seven in the final 36 seconds, and George Washington held on to beat Milwaukee 66-63 at the Bahamas Showcase on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Potter hit 12 of 14 free throws, grabbed seven rebounds and had seven assists. Jamison Battle had 12 points and 12 rebounds for George Washington (3-4).</p>
      <p>The Colonials took their biggest lead when Javier Langarica’s 3-pointer made it 51-37 with 9:53 left. Milwaukee scored the next six points and a layup by Josh Thomas’ layup made it a five-point game with 28 seconds to go but Potter hit 5-of-6 free throws from there to seal it.</p>
      <p>Darius Roy had 14 points and six rebounds for the Panthers (5-3). Thomas added 11 points and Amir Allen scored 10.</p>
      <p>George Washington takes on South Carolina on the road next Sunday. Milwaukee plays Drake on the road next Tuesday.</p>
