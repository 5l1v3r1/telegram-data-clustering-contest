      <p>If you thought the limited-run Sian was over the top, wait till you get a load of the super-extreme Lambo V12 Vision GT car that was just revealed at the Gran Turismo Championships World Finals in Monaco.With the anticipation and media build-up befitting a new real-world supercar debut, none other than Automobili Lamborghini’s CEO Stefano Domenicali appeared on stage to unveil the most extreme Lambo ever. While a full-sized, real-life mock-up of the car monopolized the crowd’s attention, the car will only appear online in the virtual world.</p>
      <p>Domenicali was then joined by Gran Turismo’s creator and producer, Kazunori Yamauchi, in a brief talk session to explain the car’s highlights. “We are creating the base for future products targeting the young generation. And we know that games and simulation appeal to young customers so we see a great connect here with Gran Turismo,” said Domenicali.</p>
      <p>Employing the same hybridized V12 as the Sian, which combines a supercapacitor with the Aventador’s V12 unit, the 4WD Lambo V12 will unleash around 808 horsepower when it appears in Gran Turismo Sport in spring 2020 and will no doubt feature in the 2020 GT World Tour events. </p>

      <p>At Lamborghini’s home in Sant’ Agata Bolognese, engineers have estimated this virtual V12 would tip the scales at a feather-weight 819 kgs, which when powered by 819hp V12, approaches the fantastical one-to-one power to weight ratio.</p>
      <p>The legendary Gandini Line profile that characterizes Lamborghini’s silhouette is still visible and in perfect proportion with the rest of the car, which I might add, has been significantly restyled in a design process that is as edgy as it is outlandish, and with a heavy focus on aerodynamics. </p>
      <p>Inspired by a jet fighter and the Batmobile (Bruce Wayne said ‘do you have it in black?’), all four corners of the car have been isolated independently of each other around a single-seater cabin into which a driver enters from the front, much like the canopy of a stealth fighter. Head of design, Mitja Borkert, explained that his design team dug deeper than normal into their collective styling juices to create a concept existing outside of any envelopes they’d previously worked with.</p>
      <p>“Let’s do a single seater race car, and not just a derivative of something. Pure, low and with extreme proportions,” said Borkert. The V12 may have an over the top body, but it still incorporates the brand’s signature design notes, namely the Y-shaped accents on the headlights and tail lights.</p>

      <p>The single seat cockpit is expected to be even more futuristic than the radical exterior treatment. “The Lambo V12 will have holographic displays that project information to the drivers on the windscreen,” said Domenicali.</p>
      <p>Lamborghini now joins brands such as Bugatti, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Jaguar, BMW, Nissan, McLaren and Honda to design a car specifically for the Gran Turismo franchise. To celebrate its 15th anniversary in 2013, Gran Turismo created their Vision GT program that challenged car manufacturers to create designs that pushed the envelope, virtual racing cars for the game that utilized alternative forms of propulsion and advanced aerodynamics.</p>
      <p>Even though this Lambo has a supercapacitor, and as such, is considered “hybridized,” I’m sure that many fans will breathe a sigh of relief to know that this Gran Turismo machine will retain its stonking V12 engine.</p>
