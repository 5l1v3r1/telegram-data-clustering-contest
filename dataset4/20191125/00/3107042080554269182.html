      <p>NZ Nurses Organisation organiser and former academic Tracey McLellan will contest the Banks Peninsula seat for Labour in the 2020 general election.</p>
      <p>The Labour Party's senior vice president was selected at a meeting on Sunday to replace outgoing MP Ruth Dyson. She beat out the other nominees Joe Davies, Tyrone Fields and Reuben Davidson.</p>
      <p>“It’s an immense privilege to have been selected as Labour’s candidate for Banks Peninsula. I am standing for Parliament because local people need a strong voice to deliver for them,” said Dr McLellan.</p>
      <p>“Under Jacinda Ardern’s Labour-led Government, New Zealand is heading in the right direction.</p>
      <p>"We are investing in tackling long-term challenges that effect people in this area. With rising wages and falling unemployment, our economy is strong and we are making record investments in new schools, hospitals and mental health care."</p>
      <p>Dr McLellan, 49, has been a Labour Party member since 2011 with her son Jake McLellan, who was elected onto the Christchurch City Council this year.</p>
      <p>"It’s important Banks Peninsula has a strong voice in government to continue this progress and keep up the momentum," she said.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.odt.co.nz/star-news/star-christchurch/election-boundary-shake-cards-canterbury">It comes after electoral boundary changes were proposed for Canterbury which could see Selwyn redrawn and a name change for the Port Hills electorate.</a>
      </p>
      <p>The changes would see Selwyn's map redrawn to no longer include Banks Peninsula, which could mean the current Port Hills electorate would be re-named Banks Peninsula.</p>
      <p>“Banks Peninsula is a wonderful area with strong, diverse communities. This area has been incredibly well deserved by Ruth Dyson for the last 26 years, and I want to bring my own hard work, passion and dedication to continuing her work standing up for local people," Dr McLellan said.</p>
      <p>She currently works for NZNO as an organiser and has a PhD in psychology from Canterbury  University.</p>
      <p>Dr McLellan was born and grew up in a state house in Southland and moved to Christchurch in 2002. She has two sons.</p>
