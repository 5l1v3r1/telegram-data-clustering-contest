        <b>Former Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong has taken a swipe at manager Unai Emery after the Gunners draw against Southampton on Sunday. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Arsenal played out a 2-2 draw with Southampton at the Emirates Stadium in North London in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The Gunners twice had to come from behind to pick up a point from the encounter, and the Saints were the better team overall in the game.</p>
      <p>Arsenal manager Emery is under pressure at the moment, with his team struggling in their quest to finish in the top four of the Premier League table this season.</p>
      <p>Frimpong was on the books of Arsenal from 2001 until 2014, and he has asked Emery to give his weekly wage to charity - presumably because he is not doing his job as he is expected to.</p>
