      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - Rapper T.I. says he was joking when he said he goes to the gynecologist with his daughter every year to make sure her hymen is “still intact.”</p>
      <p>The performer, who received backlash when the comments went viral earlier this month, told Jada Pinkett-Smith on Monday’s episode of “Red Table Talk” that he also apologized to his daughter.</p>
      <p>Says T.I.: “I began to embellish and exaggerate, and I think a lot of people kind of took it extremely literal.”</p>
      <p>Planned Parenthood and others blasted T.I. when he told the “Ladies Like Us” podcast that he takes “yearly trips to the gynecologist” with his now 18-year-old daughter.</p>
