      <h1>How This New Scent Company Is Revolutionizing the Fragrance Industry</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Celia Shatzman</a></address>
      <p>Every few years, a disruptor comes along in the beauty industry—and it seems like one just arrived in the fragrance world. Edge Beauty launched <a href="https://scentbeauty.com/">ScentBeauty</a> as the very first multi-brand e-commerce platform for bespoke fragrances that are crafted with brands and celebrities from across the globe. Their first partnership is with none other than Cher, on her spicy vanilla musk, <a href="https://scentbeauty.com/products/cher-eau-de-couture">Cher Eau De Couture</a>. The direct-to-consumer business is giving customers a deeper, inside look at fragrance by educating them through their innovative, custom sampling; offering a live chat with a perfumer; and a comprehensive editorial platform. Stephen Mormoris, the CEO and Founder of Edge Beauty—and formerly the CMO of Coty—tells us all about it.</p>

      <p><i>Why did you launch Edge Beauty? </i>The genesis of the idea for the company was to provide a more direct consumer experience than what we’ve been seeing in general in brick and mortar retail for the last 10 years, and also to provide more education and discovery of olfactory experiences beyond traditional fragrance. Because of the big migration from retail to direct to consumer models through e-commerce combined with fact that the younger generation were experiencing scent in different ways, beyond the use of eau de toilette or eau de parfum, we could create a forum where consumers discover unique brands that speak to them in a shopping context they couldn’t find out there.</p>
      <p><i>What makes yours different from all the other fragrance companies? </i>What differentiates ScentBeauty is that we are interested in a curated approach to fragrance where we are looking for new culturally relevant brands. We have embarked on a program that creates brands only available on ScentBeauty.com. We see consumers increasingly interested in artisanship and storytelling, and drawn to scarcity because they don’t want to be wearing the same fragrance everyone else is wearing. We have a roster of unique brands that we ourselves create in close partnership with many different companies, artists, fashion houses, even lifestyle concepts. This differentiates us because we are not just a retailer—we’re a creator of unique brands.</p>

      <p><i>How has the fragrance world changed over the course of your career? </i>I would say the consumption of fragrances has fundamentally been in flux for the last 10 years and it is due to several things: First, the big fundamental reason that Baby Boomers and people generally over 40 have been using fragrance is sex, seduction and social status, which gave rise to giant businesses linked to fashion brands like Gucci, Prada or Dior. That’s still today very valid, but not exclusively the reason anymore young people will be using fragrance. Young people entering the market are looking for more individuality, looking to connect to it like a tattoo—it enhances their sense of self-identity, confidence, mood alteration, comfort. The reason to wear fragrance is very different, which has given birth to independent brands. Scent has broader meaning; it can be candles, home diffusers, CBD fragrances, or even the flavored scent of e-cigarettes. We see the younger consumer is looking for a broader experience of scent.<i> </i>Another piece in this is consumers are discovering the world through the internet. There are a lot of small, exquisite brands and experiences out there, which has given rise to an explosion of artisan brands, like Tom Ford and Frederic Malle, who are offering storytelling and luxury and a sensation of craftsmanship that previously didn’t exist. It’s very important to the growth of the category. The whole rise of artisanship is a trend that’s here to stay, a change away from large monolithic brands everyone was wearing 20 years ago.</p>
      <p><i>Why do you look beyond the typical celebrity partnerships? </i>Labeled as the Icons Series, we felt strongly not to repeat the celebrity model of the past, which was mass market, typically in the fruity floral area, and famous people enriching themselves through licensing deals. We felt that was wrong and not a legitimate way of creating a superior olfactive product. We want to provide a forum for different artists to express themselves in an olfactive way. We launch a new artist every month. In addition to Cher, [upcoming collaborations include] Renée Fleming, Eye Am Conchita, André Leon Talley, and many, many others. We were looking for people from different artistic spectrums—music, sculpture, poetry, cosmetics—whatever really is a supreme form of artistic expression. It levels the playing field. We have a big star in terms of numbers, like Cher, coexisting with someone more niche like André Leon Talley, but we think that offers validity to program. We are the National Geographic of fragrance; every month we are coming out with a fragrance that has a story.<i> </i>Artists are doing this because they truly believe in their art, in this case the art of olfactory expression. Every artist is completely involved.</p>

      <p><i>What was the concept behind </i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/3F4B4D24-4597-477D-A9A0-52BD392DC646?ingress=0&amp;visitId=fa46d82d-5500-44a5-9a38-f8ed64af8a98"><i>Esscentials</i></a><i>? </i>ScentBeauty decided not only to do partnerships but create our own brands. We’re focusing on the natural segment. It’s another white space. Our scents have high degrees of natural content; they’re light but complex in an olfactory way. We have transparent ingredient labeling and they’re relatively biodegradable. We decided to launch a series that taps into the good for the planet movement. We partnered with the channel that gets the most people, which is Amazon. They have recyclable glass, a plantable carton, and a range of scents that someone experiences every day, like Good Morning! and Cozy Up!</p>
      <p><i>Why is having an editorial platform important to you? </i>ScentBeauty is also, for lack of a better word, a media company. We felt strongly that to sell and engage consumers in uniquely created brands, we needed a forum of education and self-discovery. For <a href="https://scentbeauty.com/blogs/news">Scent Journal</a>, we’re recruiting the best writers and videographers to show people the beauty and excitement of scent. I’ve seen done it effectively through makeup like Glossier and fashion like Net-A-Porter; we’re simply replicating the model. It’s pure editorial, which does not sell our products but educates consumers on different aspects of scent. One column is called Behind the Scents, on the creation of a fragrance or what’s going on in the industry. For another column called On the Streets, we go to a city like Hong Kong and film people asking what scent are you wearing and why, what do you like about it. We don’t want to come off as too erudite or too high brow; we’re putting a mirror to the world about what people are wearing.</p>

      <p><i>Since people can’t smell fragrance while shopping online, how are you working around that? </i>Of course it’s a challenge to sell a product that people can’t experience directly online. We’ve embarked on a comprehensive sampling program. We’re selling curated sample kits of beautiful two milliliter vials in a spray or rollerball format that comes in a beautiful case. The price point is accessible below $20, and they get a coupon off on a full size for the amount, so there’s no financial risk. It has proven to be effective—it has already been done on the market. We’re also embarking on a campaign of partnering with sampling companies like Birchbox and Allure. For many consumers, that is easier than going to a department store.</p>
      <p><i>How does Scent Lounge work? </i>For this program, we are partnering with different influencers. We call them pop up fragrances. We think it’s an extremely exciting way to showcase very creative people who have a very dedicated followership and we’re approaching it from a different way. We’re launching with the Suarez sisters for December, then Jon Boy Tattoo, Lottie Moss—the sister of Kate Moss, and a model named Rahi Chadda. They’ll be launching online and on their social media channels as well, where they can share the story behind the scents. We’re working far in advance with influencers, following them around with cameras and watching them create the scent and bottles and social media campaigns. We’re rejuvenating that fragrance is something for everyone, including young people entering the market.</p>
