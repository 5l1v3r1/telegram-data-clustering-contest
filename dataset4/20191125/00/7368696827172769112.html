      <h1>Half-Life: Alyx Minimum System Requirements Revealed</h1>

      <p>Valve revealed the next game in their iconic franchise, Half-Life: Alyx, to the world last week. The game is, without a doubt, a very ambitious VR title featuring a 15-hour campaign and the trailer looks absolutely fantastic. Half-Life: Alyx releases exclusively on VR devices for PC in March 2020 but you will also need a PC to match or exceed the Half-Life: Alyx minimum system requirements.</p>

      <p>The Half-Life: Alyx minimum system requirements don’t look too bad at all, especially for those who own a very expensive PC VR headset, such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive or Valve Index. The game looks so incredible and when one takes into account that you need a high and stable FPS for VR (unless you want to get sick almost instantly) then the Half-Life: Alyx minimum system requirements aren’t all that bad at all.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>OS:</b> Windows 10</li>
        <li><b>Processor:</b> Core i5-7500 / Ryzen 5 1600</li>
        <li><b>Memory:</b> 12 GB RAM</li>
        <li><b>Graphics:</b> GTX 1060 / RX 580 – 6GB VRAM</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is no doubt that the game will sell VR headsets like hotcakes and this could just be the game that pushes VR more towards the mainstream. It is THAT game that we’ve been waiting for. However, it is interesting that the Valve Index VR headset has lower system requirements with a minimum of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>OS:</b> Windows 10, SteamOS, Linux</li>
        <li><b>Processor:</b> Dual Core with Hyper-Threading</li>
        <li><b>Memory:</b> 8 GB RAM</li>
        <li><b>Graphics:</b> Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 / AMD RX480</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As a reminder, Half-Life: Alyx will be free for those with a Valve Index headset, while others will have to purchase the game. Luckily for South Africans, the game is very cheap at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/">R296.10</a> compared to the $60 price tag in the US.</p>
