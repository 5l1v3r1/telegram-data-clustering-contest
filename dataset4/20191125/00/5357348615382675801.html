        <b>GENERAL secretary of the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) Dr Horace Chang says that, with a general election likely next year, he is comfortable that the party's machinery is oiled and ready to respond.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking with the <b>Jamaica Observer</b> following the 76th staging of the JLP's annual general conference at the National Arena yesterday, he noted, “In the meantime, we will continue the training and recruitment that is ongoing in the party to ensure that we are in the best of shape.”</p>
      <p>He said the party is in “pretty good shape” for an election now, but that it was not quite ready yet.</p>
      <p>“We have some time; we'll do it at the right time,” he said.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the show of support for the highly anticipated annual conference, the national security minister said: “We had an excellent turnout, given the normal level of mobilisation. The spirit and the mood of the workers was very high.”</p>
      <p>Speaking from the platform, Dr Chang insisted that one term is not enough for the party, as it had inherited 22 years of incompetence and neglect.</p>
      <p>“We are now on the right path, moving in the right direction,” he told supporters.</p>
      <p>Chairman of the JLP and Member of Parliament for St Mary Western Robert Montague echoed the confidence expressed in Holness by the slate of speakers at the conference, stating that, at 76 years old, “The party is looking good...your party is in good hands, your party is in good shape.”</p>
      <p>However, he noted that it is parties that win elections, not governments, and that the JLP was in no rush to go to the polls, as it had projects to complete, and candidates to install.</p>
      <p>In a jab at the Opposition People's National Party (PNP) and its leader, Dr Peter Phillips, Montague said: “Some people are in desperate haste to have an election,” but that call is in the hands of Prime Minister Andrew Holness.</p>
      <p>He said no election would be called until the JLP saw it fit, as it would listen to the delegates of the party to ensure that the right candidates are selected.</p>
      <p>“We are looking for winners,” he said.</p>
      <p>He also dismissed claims by the Opposition of inappropriately spending $1.6 billion on a de-bushing programme in St Thomas, summing up the latest accusation of corruption against the ruling party as an election ploy.</p>
      <p>The Rural Agricultural Development Authority (RADA) has dismissed as “untrue” and “absurd” a claim by the Opposition leader that funds allocated for the Farm Rehabilitation Programme were being mismanaged.</p>
      <p>According to RADA, the total value of the programme for work done across the island over the past four years is $1.7 billion.</p>
