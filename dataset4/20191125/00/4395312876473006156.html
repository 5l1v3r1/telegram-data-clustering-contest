      <p>As<i> a part of our Meet The Rising Stars series, I had the distinct pleasure of interviewing Wyatt McClure. Wyatt is an 11 year old Cleveland, Ohio native currently filming Young Sheldon as a recurring character. He plays Billy Sparks, Sheldon‚Äôs next door neighbor. He is also a kid comedian and enjoys doing stand up routines.</i></p>

        <b>Thank you so much for doing this with us! Can you tell us the story of how you grew up?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Well I am still growing up! I was born in Cleveland, OH and still live there when I am not filming. I enjoy being a kid at home riding bikes, playing basketball and hanging with my friends.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Can you share a story with us about what brought you to this specific career path?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I love watching cartoons and told my mom that I wanted to be on TV like them. She was able to find someone who worked in Cleveland and I was cast in 2 movies in 2 months!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Can you tell us the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I was working on the 1st movie and was 6 years old. I was really hot in the church I was filming in and they brought in air conditioners with long tubes. When no one was watching I crawled into it to cool down. They started to film and no one could find me because I was stuck in the tube!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?</b>
      </p>
      <p>When I first started I would hear people (turns out it was the director) yelling things like Rolling! Cut! Take 2‚Ä¶. I thought we could all do that so I would start yelling it out during takes and confusing the cast. I was only a little kid and it was funny at first for them but‚Ä¶. cost them time and money. I learned that I am an actor and only say my lines! lol</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are some of the most interesting or exciting projects you are working on now?</b>
      </p>

      <p>I am a recurring character on Young Sheldon and I a working on a few projects I can‚Äôt talk about¬†‚Ä¶ Yet!</p>
      <p>
        <b>We are very interested in diversity in the entertainment industry. Can you share three reasons with our readers about why you think it‚Äôs important to have diversity represented in film and television? How can that potentially affect our culture?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Diversity is very important. I meet a lot of people in my business and feel like everyone‚Äôs story needs to be told.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are your ‚Äú5 things I wish someone told me when I first started‚Äù and why. Please share a story or example for each.</b>
      </p>
      <p>1. Act Professional- as I grow older I understand that being professional on set and even in public people will respect you.</p>
      <p>2. Its not just about the lines you learn. You need to understand the scene. You have to put yourself into that character and use the correct emotion.</p>
      <p>3. Be nice to everyone- Everyone from the craft service to the director has a hand in the movie or show and everyone works very hard. A smile goes a long way to them.</p>
      <p>4. You won‚Äôt get every role you audition for- This is a hard business to be in and lots of people are going for the same role. You may not be a good fit for many reasons like size, hair color, eye color or any other reason.</p>
      <p>5. Don‚Äôt give up! If you want it you need to work for it! Acting Classes, comedy classes, workshops, acting coaches are just some examples of the hard work you need to put into it.</p>

        <b>Which tips would you recommend to your colleagues in your industry to help them to thrive and not ‚Äúburn out‚Äù?</b>
      </p>
      <p>You still need to be a kid. Take time out to enjoy life! Take a vacation, go visit family, play sports, it doesn‚Äôt have to be 24 /7 work!</p>
      <p>
        <b>You are a person of enormous influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger.¬†üôÇ</b>
      </p>
      <p>Being a bigger size person I would love for people to understand that people come in all shapes and sizes. Nobody should be made fun of because they don‚Äôt fit the typical size. I am always considered a bully but that could not be farther than the truth but it is stereo typed because of my size.</p>
      <p>
        <b>None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I am most grateful to my agents and my acting coach Geoffrey Kennedy. He has been my coach for the last 5 years. He has never given up on me and always gets me in character. He has helped me get many parts and is a great coach!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Can you please give us your favorite ‚ÄúLife Lesson Quote‚Äù?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life? Life is to short and you need to live to your fullest. I used to be scarred to do different things but my mom told me life is short and try everyone once!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Is there a person in the world, or in the US whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this, especially if we tag them.¬†üôÇ</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kevin Hart! I look up to him as a comedian and an actor‚Ä¶ My dream is to have a meal with him‚Ä¶ Hey Kevin!</p>
