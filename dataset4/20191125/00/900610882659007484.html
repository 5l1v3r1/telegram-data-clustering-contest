      <h1>Hong Kong Airport to close Terminal 2 for its three-runway system project</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Jackie Chen</a></address>
      <p>Hong Kong International Airport will temporarily close Terminal 2 (T2) for expansion work as part of its three-runway system project.</p>
      <p>Check-in counters at T2 will suspend operation at around 2300 on November 28. Check-in services for all airlines will be carried out in Terminal 1 (T1) instead.</p>
      <p>This means all passengers flying through Hong Kong Airport will need to arrive and check-in at T1, and those taking Airport Express to the airport starting from 2250 on 28 November will need to get off and check in at T1.</p>
      <p>Due to the closure of T2, Plaza Premium <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2019/10/18/plaza-premium-is-closing-its-hong-kong-terminal-2-arrivals-lounge/">closed its Terminal 2 arrivals lounge</a> earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The extension of the airport’s T1 is set to begin on Thursday November 29.</p>

      <p>This extension will see the addition of a new Aisle L with 48 check-in counters, bringing the total number of check-in counters in T1 to 369. The number of smart check-in kiosks in T1 will also increase to over 100 at the extended departure level.</p>
      <p>Airline check-in counters at T2 will be relocated to T1 from 29 November except for Easter Jet, Jeju Air and Jetstar Japan, which will be relocated to T1 from 2230 on 28 November. Below are some airlines’ check-in counter relocation details:</p>

      <p>Ancillary services that are currently provided in T2, including the lost and found office and baggage storage service, will be relocated to Arrivals Hall A, Level 5, T1 (non-restricted area). These will be in service in T1 on November 29.</p>
      <p>The new ticketing counters for cross-boundary limousine and coach service will be relocated to the Arrivals level of the T1 extension area and open on the same day.</p>
      <p>Two additional baggage reclaim carousels in the restricted area at the Arrivals level as well as catering kiosks and offices will begin service in phases, according to the airport.</p>
      <p>The Airport Authority said signage and notices will be updated to provide clear directions at the airport, while additional staff will be available to assist passengers.</p>
      <p>T2 is expected to reopen in 2024 after its expansion, along with the commissioning of the entire three-runway system. T2 will then be a full-service terminal, providing both arrivals and departure services.</p>

      <p>Hong Kong’s Executive Council approved a plan to expand Hong Kong Airport into a three-runway system in March 2015.</p>
      <p>The three-runway system will be located on 650-hectares of reclaimed land, and the project’s key facilities will include a new 3.8 km runway parallel to the two existing ones, taxiways, aprons, a third runway concourse, an expanded T2, a new automated people mover system (a small-scale automated transit system) and a new baggage handling system.</p>
      <p>The estimated cost of the project will be over HK$140 billion (US$17 billion). The three-runway system is projected to handle 30 million more passengers annually upon its completion.</p>
