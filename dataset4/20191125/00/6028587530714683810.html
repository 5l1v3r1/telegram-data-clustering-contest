      <p>The U.S. Navy was rocked Sunday as the tenure of the 76<sup>th</sup> Secretary of the Navy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_V._Spencer">Richard V. Spencer</a>, came to a fiery end, collapsing in a remarkable array of <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2025157/statement-by-dod-spokesman-jonathan-hoffman/">announcements</a>, <a href="https://news.usni.org/2019/11/24/secnav-spencer-to-resign-over-gallagher-deal-with-white-house-modly-now-acting-secnav">letters</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1198746358091530241">Presidential tweets</a>. The Trump Administration is offering three different versions of Spencer’s demise.</p>
      <p>The first, revealed in an unprecedentedly bitter Sunday afternoon <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2025157/statement-by-dod-spokesman-jonathan-hoffman/">statement</a>, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that, "Secretary of Defense <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Our-Story/Biographies/Biography/Article/1378166/dr-mark-t-esper/">Mark T. Esper</a> has asked for the resignation of Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer after losing trust and confidence in him regarding his lack of candor over conversations with the White House involving the handling of Navy SEAL <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Gallagher_(Navy_SEAL)">Eddie Gallagher</a>.” Apparently Secretary Esper had discovered that the Secretary of the Navy, who had taken a very public stance against Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, had gone rogue and privately proposed to the White House to restore Gallagher’s rank and allow him to retire with his Trident pin.</p>
      <p>President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Donald J. Trump</a> added to the confusion in a late afternoon <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1198746358091530241">tweetstorm</a>, joining Esper in announcing Secretary Spencer’s termination. The Presidential tweets highlighted the President’s dissatisfaction with Gallagher’s trial and treatment as well as asserting that “large cost overruns from past administration’s contracting procedures were not addressed to my satisfaction.”</p>
      <p>A third version of the events came from the Secretary of the Navy himself. In an <a href="https://news.usni.org/2019/11/24/secnav-spencer-to-resign-over-gallagher-deal-with-white-house-modly-now-acting-secnav">angry letter</a> acknowledging his immediate termination, Spencer wrote, “I no longer share the same understanding with the Commander in Chief who appointed me, in regards to the key principle of good order and discipline.” He continued, “I cannot in good conscience obey an order that I believe violates the sacred oath I took in the presence of my family, my flag and my faith to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.” Spencer also cited programmatic differences, writing that the President deserves to have a Navy Secretary “who is aligned with his vision for the future of our force generation and sustainment.”</p>
      <p>The implications posed by these competing narratives and counterclaims will play out over the coming days and weeks, particularly if an aggrieved Richard Spencer, in a departure from longstanding Administration norms, refuses to leave quietly.</p>

        <b>Spencer Was Set To Be Jettisoned</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rumors about Spencer’s fate have been flying for months. In many ways, Secretary Spencer was already something of a lame duck, fatally injured by his own management style and an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/craighooper/2019/10/16/the-navys-accountability-crisis-over-a-bet-ensnares-its-top-leader/#3a141c9d1098">unfortunate lost bet</a> over the progress of the troubled and pricey USS <i>Gerald R. Ford</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Gerald_R._Ford">CVN 78</a>) aircraft carrier.</p>
      <p>The fact that the Administration has already announced a nominee for Secretary, Norway Ambassador and former Admiral <a href="https://no.usembassy.gov/our-relationship/our-ambassador/">Ken Braithwaite</a>, suggests that Esper’s efforts to oust Secretary Spencer were already well advanced.</p>
      <p>Even without the Gallagher fiasco, Secretary Spencer was already an intolerable burden to the Administration. The powerful and deeply respected Republican Senator <a href="https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/">James Inhofe</a>, chairman of the <a href="https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> had turned on Spencer <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?463063-1/chief-naval-operations-confirmation-hearing&amp;start=742">in July 2019</a>, blasting Secretary Spencer’s bet on the USS <i>Ford</i>, saying it either indicated “poor knowledge of the facts or poor judgment—and this is the latest example of Navy leaders not being straightforward when it comes to the program.” Spencer made his problems in Congress even worse when he <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/craighooper/2019/10/28/troubled-navy-secretary-attacks-congress-as-his-most-expensive-ship-goes-to-sea/#58e0211d6869">verbally assailed</a> <a href="https://luria.house.gov/">Representative Elaine Luria</a>, an up-and-coming member of the House Armed Services Committee, over her efforts to offer oversight on the Navy’s carrier fleet. Given those obvious breaches, Spencer was dead weight and simply unable to represent the Navy before Congress in the budget fights to come.</p>
      <p>While Navy leadership may appreciate Secretary Spencer’s stand against Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, senior Navy leaders are still seething over Secretary Spencer’s <a href="https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/07/08/adm-bill-moran-out-as-navys-next-cno/">abrupt dismissal</a> of <a href="https://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/navybio.asp?bioID=483">Admiral Bill Moran</a>, who was days away from becoming the next Chief of Naval Operations. Admiral Moran was poised to become one of the strongest Chiefs of Naval Operations in decades, ascending right at the time when the Navy desperately needed strong leadership. The flimsy pretext Secretary Spencer used to fire Moran and elevate a lower-ranking <a href="https://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/navybio.asp?bioID=605">Admiral Michael Gilday</a> to the lofty CNO post left many wondering if Spencer was more interested in removing a potential bureaucratic rival than about Spencer’s late-breaking concerns over Moran’s judgment. </p>
      <p>Spencer was also preparing to drive significant and controversial changes in the Navy’s force structure—while juggling cost overruns and an inability to fully pay for everything in the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). Premier big ticket Navy programs, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Gerald_R._Ford"><i>Ford class</i></a> carrier, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia-class_submarine"><i>Columbia class</i></a> ballistic missile submarine, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia-class_submarine"><i>Virginia class</i></a> attack submarine are not moving smoothly, and Spencer’s advocacy for unmanned platforms was falling flat with stakeholders worried that the technology wasn’t ready and that the Navy was about to repeat the mistakes seen on the <i>Ford</i> on a Fleet-wide scale.</p>
      <p>At some level, Spencer had to know that his time was limited. In late October, Spencer <a href="https://news.usni.org/2019/10/28/secnav-spencer-jim-webb-honor-lost-south-vietnamese-soldiers-in-california-ceremony">spent time</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Webb#Personal_life">Jim Webb</a>, a fellow Marine and the only Secretary of the Navy in recent history to have resigned in protest after refusing to carry out President Ronald Reagan’s directive to reduce the size of the Navy in 1988. And with the USS <i>Gerald R. Ford</i> set to arrive back in port after about three weeks at sea, the stage may be set for another damaging round of finger-pointing over the slow and halting progress of America’s thirteen-billion dollar aircraft carrier.</p>
      <p>In the end, Spencer had to go, and the Administration, with a replacement nominee for Navy Secretary already lined up, only needed a pretext. But rather than purge Spencer quietly, over a long Thanksgiving Holiday, Spencer’s removal was inexplicably executed in an abrupt, haphazard fashion that damages both the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>
