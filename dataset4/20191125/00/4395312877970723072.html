      <p>Burnout is a common problem among entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs are known for overworking in an effort to create success in their businesses. The demands of entrepreneurship combined with the grueling schedule that many entrepreneurs work often lead to chronic stress, which can lead to burnout. It’s important to know the symptoms of burnout if you want to avoid it. </p>
      <p>Here are some of the symptoms of burnout that you should be aware of.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Exhaustion</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the first signs that you are close to burning out is <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/237606">exhaustion</a>. If you’re burning out, you will likely feel tired regardless of how much sleep you get. Your exhaustion could be physical, emotional, or mental— or all three combined. If you can’t remember the last time you felt energized, you could be nearing burnout. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Lack of productivity</b>
      </p>
      <p>As a result of your exhaustion and decreased motivation, you may also notice that you are less productive than you used to be, no matter how much you work. Your business’s results will likely suffer. You may see that your inbox is constantly full and feel like you never have time to tackle the most important work that needs to be done. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Feelings of being overwhelmed</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you’re nearing burnout, you may also notice that you’re feeling overwhelmed by tasks that you once could handle with ease. As you notice that you’re less productive than before, your feelings of overwhelm will increase. These feelings of overwhelm can lead to a loss of motivation and excitement about your work. You might even begin to dread the start of each day. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Frustration, cynicism, and other negative emotions</b>
      </p>
      <p>On the road to burnout, you’re also likely to feel numerous negative emotions including frustration, cynicism, and irritability. You might start to be annoyed by coworkers, even ones who you’ve never felt annoyed with in the past. Many people who burn out also experience depression and feelings of anxiety. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Other symptoms</b>
      </p>
      <p>There are numerous other symptoms of burnout, including insomnia, lack of appetite, panic attacks, and increasing forgetfulness. You may also get ill more often and experience headaches, heart palpitations, stomach pain, and dizziness. If you experience these types of physical symptoms, be sure to contact your doctor right away. </p>
      <p><b>What to do if you’re experiencing the symptoms of entrepreneurial burnout</b>.</p>
      <p>If you suspect that you’re on the road to burnout, take some time off to take care of yourself. You might feel like you can’t afford to take time off from your business, but your business depends on you being the best version of yourself. </p>
      <p>Focus on your physical, mental, and emotional health. Get some rest, connect with some of your neglected friends and family members, and do some activities that you enjoy. Switch up your diet and make sure you’re eating foods that fuel your body properly. You can also try some rejuvenating exercise, such as yoga. </p>
      <p>When you return to work, make self-care a priority. If you can learn to effectively manage your stress, you can successfully build your dreams as an entrepreneur and thrive while doing so!</p>
