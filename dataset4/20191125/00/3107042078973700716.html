        <b>United by a passion for bikes, the six-member Columb family’s successfully built New Zealand’s original off-road tour company from humble beginnings. As Off Road Adventures celebrates its 30th birthday, Philip Chandler takes a ride on the wild side</b>
      </p>
      <p>Two German visitors to Queenstown in 1989, Hans and Ralf, have a lot to answer for.</p>
      <p>Wanting to get out and about on motorcycles, they chanced upon self-employed plumber Denis Columb, who also had a passion for motorbikes.</p>
      <p>He told them he’d take them for a three-hour ride the following day.</p>
      <p>That first ride turned into nine hours, and turned into what became New Zealand’s first off-road tour business.</p>
      <p>From the start, the entire Columb family have been integral cogs in Off Road Adventures, which this month celebrated its 30th birthday.</p>
      <p>Columb’s wife Marilyn co-founded the business, and their kids Brendan, Lachie, Scott and Alanna have all guided for the company – Scott’s currently head guide.</p>
      <p>“Our family lives and breathes everything off-road, and that has no doubt been integral to the longevity and success of the business,” Denis says.</p>
      <p>“We genuinely love nothing more than sharing our passion with visitors.”</p>

      <p>The family’s also enjoyed racing various bikes – between them, Lachie, on quad bikes and motorcycles, Scott, in supercross and motocross, and Alanna, on downhill mountain bikes, have amassed 13 national titles.</p>
      <p>Those three have also successfully represented NZ on the international stage.</p>
      <p>Along with other guides, the family-owned company’s taken more than 150,000 commercial tours and conducted 320,000 hours of guiding.</p>
      <p>Famous guests have included filmmaker Steven Spielberg, and actor Orlando Bloom during The Lord of the Rings film shoot.</p>
      <p>“We’ve hosted some great guests, many of whom have become long-term friends and now bring new generations of their families,” Denis says.</p>
      <p>The company operates 150 top-of-the-range bikes, sports buggies and 4x4s, and is an official partner of Yamaha NZ.</p>
      <p>“We want to take people off the beaten track and push the boundaries in tourism for a true Kiwi adventure.</p>
      <p>“We always go the extra mile to ensure all of our guests are as safe as can be and have the time of their life.”</p>
      <p>Nowadays, the company’s rated Queenstown’s number one guided tour operator on TripAdvisor.</p>
      <p>And it’s spread its offerings all the way from one-hour adventures to bespoke, luxury, multi-day expeditions across the South Island.</p>
      <p>Assisting those longer trips, the company also owns accommodation hubs in the Hakataramea Valley and in Naseby.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a fun journey and one that’s not ready to slow down any time soon,” Denis says.</p>
