      <h1>Raheem Sterling Nominated for BBC's Sports Personality of the Year Award</h1>

      <p>​Raheem Sterling has capped a stellar year for both Manchester City and England with a nomination for the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year Award.</p>
      <p>While the 24-year-old has excelled on the pitch in Pep Guardiola's title-winning side, he has also become a prominent figure off it in the face of great adversity and a previously hostile media climate.</p>

      <p>Sterling has emerged as a leading voice in the fight against racism in football, regularly speaking out and applying pressure on the powers that be to do more to stamp out the kind of bigotry that has reared its ugly head multiple times in recent years in football stadiums across the globe.</p>
      <p>Having been abused on several occasions for both club and country, Sterling has taken to social media to call on the FA and UEFA to take strong action against offending teams and nations.</p>

      <p>While his on-field exploits pale in comparison, the attacker has been in scintillating form both this season and last. He has netted 28 goals for <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-city">​Man City</a> so far this calendar year and claimed a second consecutive <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier League</a> title back in May, as well as an FA Cup and the Carabao Cup in a domestic treble.</p>
      <p>On the international stage, <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/raheem-sterling">​Sterling</a> has become England's most important player alongside captain <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/harry-kane">​Harry Kane</a>, adding eight more goals to his tally for 2019 so far. The man from Wembley captained the side himself at the Nations League finals in the summer as the Three Lions were defeated by the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>It is fair to say that Sterling has become one of the world's best players over the past 18 months, and his strong stance on racism in football has only enhanced his reputation.</p>

      <p>The combination of his on and off-field exertions have landed Sterling a Sports Personality of the Year nomination, although he will likely face intense competition from England cricket's Ben Stokes following his World Cup and Ashes heroics during a memorable summer.</p>
      <p>Welsh rugby player Alun Wyn Jones and athlete Dina Asher-Smith have also been nominated, with the shortlist continuing to be released ahead of the awards ceremony on Sunday 15th December.</p>
