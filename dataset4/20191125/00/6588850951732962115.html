      <p>Employees of Barclays Bank, soon to be Absa, have brought smiles on the faces of ten nursing mothers by paying for their medical bills at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH).<br/><br/>In addition, the nursing mothers received free medications and hampers. The initiative which was undertaken by Barclays employees born in the month of June was led by Mrs. Anttoinette Kwofie, Finance Director and William Easmon, People Function Director of the bank.<br/><br/>Speaking on the initiative, Mrs. Anttoinette Kwofie said as part of the bank’s employee volunteerism drive, the June-born employees made a commitment to put together their resources to support disadvantage parents to access quality health care for their babies.<br/><br/>“We believe in contributing positively to our society and impacting lives by helping members of the communities in which we operate in, to realise their possibilities. On celebrating our birthdays this year, we couldn’t help but appreciate the privilege of life. We therefore decided to support these needy nursing mothers and their premature born babies in order to reduce their financial challenges in accessing quality healthcare”, Mrs. Kwofie noted.<br/><br/>“As we transition from Barclays to Absa early next year, we will remain more committed to supporting our communities and being a force for good in our society” <br/><br/>Dr. Naa Djama Glover of the Child Healthcare Unit of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, on behalf of the hospital and patients, expressed gratitude to the employees of Barclays for their support to the mothers at a time when they needed it most. “It’s a lot of help and support to the mothers. It’s really encouraging for them because every child deserves a chance at life”.<br/>The presentation also coincided with the 2019 World Prematurity Day which is observed on November 17th each year to raise awareness of pre-term birth related worldwide. Approximately 15 million babies are born pre-term each year, representing about one in 10 of all babies born worldwide. Featured Video</p>
