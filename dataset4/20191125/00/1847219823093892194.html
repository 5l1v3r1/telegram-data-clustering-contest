        <b>Following approval from the Finance Industry Association’s council, Sanita Bajāre has become the new head of the association, as reported by the organization.</b>
      </p>
      <p>«Most Finance Industry Association council members voted in favour of Sanita Bajāre. Finance Industry Association is an important partner for the government, parliament, business organizations, as well as other organizations. For us as an association, it has always been important to be valued and constructive conversation partner. Following Sanita Bajāre joining the team, we will continue the initiated dialogue to enhance both the role of the finance sector on a national level, and the finance sector’s fight against money laundering attempts,» explains Finance Industry Association council chairperson Ieva Tetere.</p>
      <p>Bajāre will start performing her duties in the association on 25 November.</p>
      <h3>«I believe my experience and knowledge will help association’s members adopt sustainable operation models and actively implement technology development projects, as well as promote necessary regulations in sustainable funding and investments,» says Bajāre.</h3>
      <p>«My experience coordinating Latvia’s economic stabilization and growth recovery programmes in cooperation with international lenders and managing the euro project gives me confidence that any, even the biggest project, can be implemented within a specific time-frame, budget and in accordance with quality requirements as long as involved sides cooperate and understand the importance of reaching established goals. Currently we face a challenge in relation to <i>Moneyval</i> evaluation, and I will do all I can to convince international partners about Latvia’s goal to exact necessary changes. The years I have lived outside Latvia allow me to conclude that Latvia is ahead of many developed countries service range, quality and speed-wise,» says Bajāre.</p>
      <p>The main priorities of the new head of the Finance Industry Association will be implementing the 2020 plan, in which emphasis is put on work on long-term lending, as well as enforcement of financial crimes through prevention of money laundering in cooperation with Finance Intelligence Service, State Revenue Service and Finance and Capital Market Commission and other partners.</p>
