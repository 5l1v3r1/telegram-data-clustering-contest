      <p>“Some payments into TSB accounts have been delayed overnight and we are working to process these as soon as possible today,” the bank states on social media. “We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused and will ensure customers are not left out-of-pocket.”</p>
      <p>The bank has been forced to offer emergency funds, stating: “If TSB customers need emergency cash contact us via the number on the back of their card. Customers can still use their cards to make payments or withdraw cash.”</p>
      <p>Customers have replied to the bank of Twitter, with some saying that they have been unable to receive their wages as a result of the problems.</p>
      <p>These latest issues come just a few days after TSB was criticised in a report from law firm Slaughter and May for its major IT meltdown in April 2008, caused by <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2018/04/tsb-ditches-lloyds-to-migrate-to-new-tech-this-weekend/">a botched core banking replacement</a>.</p>
      <p>The report stated that there were more than 2,000 defects relating to testing at the time the new system went live, but the board were only told about 800.</p>

      <p>TSB launched migration from a legacy banking platform provided by Lloyds Banking Group to a custom-built system, Proteo4UK, in April 2018. For five days customers could not bank remotely and reported multiple problems with their accounts and transactions. Some were logged into other customers’ accounts. TSB tabled a £107 million loss as a result of the chaos, while its CEO Paul Pester resigned a few months later.</p>
      <p>The migration was a massive undertaking – five million customers and their 1.3 billion records were moved. The bank called has since called it “the most complex change programme TSB has ever carried out and one of the most complex in British banking history.” Planning for migration began more than four years before the main migration event in April 2018, and involved “extensive technical, regulatory and third-party engagement and support”.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/10/tsb-coo-whole-host-of-things-need-to-be-fixed/">In a note to employees in October</a>, TSB’s new chief operating officer told staff that it has “too many people” in some roles and that its IT infrastructure needs to be strengthened.</p>
