      <h1>Intel Core i9-10980XE Review: Better Than AMD’s Ryzen 9 3950X?</h1>

      <p>Today, Intel is lifting the embargo on reviews for its new flagship desktop processor range, known as Cascade Lake-X. At the top of the stack is the 18-core, 36-thread Core i9-10980XE, which I'll be putting through its paces in detail today and you can see the results and my conclusion below versus the latest competition from AMD, specifically the Ryzen 9 3950X. However, we need to set the scene as a lot has changed this year and is set to change again in the very, very near future courtesy of AMD's 3rd Gen Threadripper CPUs:<b>Update: </b><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2019/11/25/amd-threadripper-3970x-and-3960x-review-an-exercise-in-how-to-dominate-the-desktop-pc-processor-market/#5cde54885458">See my Review of the Threadripper 3970X and 3960X</a></p>

        <figcaption>Intel's Core i9-10980XE will retail for around $1000 compared to around $2000 for its predecessor<cite>Antony Leather</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The predecessor to the Core i9-10980XE is the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2018/11/29/intel-core-i9-9980xe-review-18-core-monster-processor-tested-against-amds-threadripper/#270aac9050d7">Core i9-9980XE</a>. Both are 18-core 36-thread processors and like the older CPU the new kid on the block is compatible with current X299 chipset motherboards too. This will potentially give it an advantage over AMD's <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2019/11/07/amd-finally-reveals-threadripper-3970x-3960x-specifications-and-pricing-up-to-60-percent-faster-too/#7a5c658e60ee">3rd Gen Threadripper CPUs</a>, which require new motherboards. Not only this, but X299 motherboards are cheaper than I expect their <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-3rd-gen-threadripper-cpu-trx40-motherboard-prices-leak/">TRX40 chipset counterparts to be.</a></p>
      <p>The biggest talking point of Cascade Lake-X, though, is the pricing. In the wake of AMD's fantastic <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2019/11/14/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-review-a-shockingly-fast-brilliant-processor/#48dbfc4b5439">Ryzen 9 3950X</a>, which offers up similar performance to Intel's Core i9-9980XE, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2019/10/01/intel-slashes-cascade-lake-x-processor-pricing-to-battle-amds-ryzen-9-3950x/#399b79ad4f25">Intel had no choice but to slash prices</a>. With Cascade Lake-X, it isn't introducing a dramatically improved architecture nor a smaller manufacturing process. This is a 14nm CPU just like the Core i9-9980XE and 7980XE before it. Thankfully for us, it cut those prices in a big way.</p>
      <p>The new CPUs are a huge amount cheaper than their predecessors, with the Core i9-9980XE retailing for close to $2000. The Core i9-10980XE's price? Closer to $1000 when it hits shelves. That is dramatic to say the least and it changes the landscape dramatically. It's now just a couple of hundred dollars more than the Ryzen 9 3950X, but offers more system bandwidth by way of extra PCI-E lanes and memory channels - it's a high-end desktop platform.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dd7fa63e0af7b0006b20161/960x0.jpg?cropX1=10&amp;cropX2=1263&amp;cropY1=0&amp;cropY2=540"/>
        <figcaption>c<cite>Intel</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I think Intel has made quite a cunning move here. Not only does it mean that those after more bandwidth than AMD's X570 platform offers now have a viable option for just a couple of hundred dollars more (there are cheaper options than the 10980XE too), but it also means its new CPUs are significantly cheaper than AMD's 3rd Gen Threadripper CPUs, which are slated to retail for $1,399 and $1,999 respectively.</p>
      <p>What we have here, then, are three very different options at very different price points aiming at largely different customers. The most interesting battle today will be between the Ryzen 9 3950X and Core i9-10980XE. Intel's 18-core CPUs have been a better bet for all-round performance than AMD's previous Threadripper CPUs, but the new 16-core Zen 2 contender is a massive leap from any 2nd Gen Ryzen CPU. This maybe paints a worrying picture for Intel as far as 3rd Gen Threadripper is concerned too, but we'll have to wait for those numbers.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Intel is also increasing the number of usable PCI-E lanes from 44 to 48, although AMD still has far more with its Threadripper platforms. However, it's also far more than either Intel or AMD's mainstream platforms, helping to justify the slightly higher prices of Cascade Lake-X CPUs, at least to some extent.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CPU test system</b>
      </p>
      <p>I've rebuilt my test systems so they use cutting-edge components and also fully up to date versions of Windows 10 with the May 1903 update along with all the various security patches - both from motherboard manufacturers and Microsoft as these are known to have impacted on performance making any data obtained prior to these updates incomparable and unrepresentative.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>I should also point out that I've used 3466MHz memory with all my systems now as this worked with older AMD CPUs as well as new ones, painting them in their best light, especially given memory prices are so low at the moment. You may see slightly better performance using faster memory, but you'll be unlikely to get that working on 1st Gen Ryzen CPUs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Overclocking the Core i9-10980XE</b>
      </p>
      <p>This one really surprised me. Both the Core i9-7980XE and Core i9-9980XE hit walls at 4.5GHz, at least with my samples, but I managed to overclock the Core i9-10980XE to a massive 4.7GHz across all cores with a vcore of 1.165V. Temperatures were the limit here, tipping the scales in the mid 80's, but this is absolutely monstrous and while I may have just struck lucky with this sample, if this is any indication of better overclocking further down the range then you could see even higher frequencies from CPUs with fewer cores.</p>

        <b>Gaming Benchmarks</b>
      </p>
      <p>When dealing with frame rates and frame times I take readings using OCAT to record the 99th percentiles in either a built-in benchmark or one I've created myself and the graphs below show the average frame rate and 99th percentile frame time reported as a minimum frame rate - that's not the same as your typical minimum frame rate, which can be highly misleading and only record a momentary blip. You can read more on that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/why-minimum-fps-can-be-misleading/">here</a>. The only exception is Shadow of the Tomb Raider where I report the games detailed built-in benchmark reading.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Far Cry 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>At stock speed both the Ryzen 9 3900X and Ryzen 9 3950X are quicker in Far Cry 5 with a higher 99th percentile minimum frame rate. However, that massive 4.7GHz all-core overclock saw the frame rates rocket to close to Core i9-9900KS levels. The Ryzen 9 3950X was 1fps qucker on the 99th percentile minimum, but noticeably slower on the average, with the Core i9-9900KS taking the crown. Only minimal gains over the Core i9-9980XE here too.</p>

        <b>Dota 2</b>
      </p>
      <p>Intel still enjoys a lead in easy-to-play high frame rate games such as DotA 2 and even with an RTX 2070 Super, there's some clear CPU scaling at 1080p, with Intel having higher average frame rates than AMD overall. The Ryzen 9 3950X wasn't far behind, though, but the massive overclock for the Intel CPU helped edge out a significant lead.</p>

        <b>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</b>
      </p>
      <p>We were approaching high GPU-bound results in this test with the most powerful processors according to the built-in benchmark, but plenty of good scaling in the CPU-related results Shadow of the Tomb Raider provides. The game seems to love both high frequencies and core counts so it wasn't surprising to see Intel's 18-core CPUs sitting at the top of the graph. It's also a result where the Ryzen 9 3950X lagged behind the most.</p>

        <b>Adobe Premiere Pro</b>
      </p>
      <p>Intel has always been strong in Premiere Pro and the Core i9-10980XE built on the lead already gained by its predecessor with the overclock nearly dipping below 100 seconds in my benchmark. While the Ryzen 9 3950X was quick for a mainstream CPU, it was no match here for the extra cores, threads and quad-channel memory of the Intel CPU, in addition to any software optimizations Intel enjoys. The Core i9-10980XE is a Premiere Pro monster.</p>

      <p>The Ryzen 9 3950X is king at stock speed but once again, the 4.7GHz all-core overclock I applied to the Core i9-10980XE saw it leapfrog the AMD CPU in a massive stride, posting by far the best result. So it's a win for AMD at stock speed and a win for Intel if you're overclocking.</p>

      </p>
      <p>AMD's darling benchmark is arguably one of the clearest when it comes to revealing the downside to Intel's ageing 14nm manufacturing process with AMD grabbing the top spots in the single-threaded tests. The Core i9-10980XE is quicker than its predecessor but lags behind the best in terms of single-threaded performance.</p>

      <p>Switch to the multi-threaded tests and things are once again dominated by AMD at stock speed, with a victory for the Ryzen 9 3950X, but the Core i9-10980XE's massive overclocking potential sees it beat the AMD chip if you're prepared to tinker with those BIOS settings.</p>

      <p>If you deal with 3D pipelines and rendering then Blender is another test that's highly relevant to CPUs of this calibre. The winner is the Threadripper 2990WX, but it's a fantastic result for the Ryzen 9 3950X. Once again, overclocking the Core i9-10980XE sees it better all but the flagship Threadripper CPU, but it's a win for AMD at stock speed.</p>

        <b>Power Consumption</b>
      </p>
      <p>The downside to that massive all-core overclock that wins Intel plenty of benchmarks is that power consumption goes through the roof. The Ryzen 9 3950X drew just 242W at stock speed and 340W once overclocked. The Intel CPU sat at 376W and 595W, so it's plain to see just how much more efficient the AMD CPU is here.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Conclusions</b>
      </p>
      <p>Intel has done the right thing in cutting prices and the reality is that even though the Ryzen 9 3950X is a stunning processor, the Core i9-10980XE still beats it in plenty of tests and it's huge overclocking headroom means it leapfrogs the otherwise dominant AMD CPU in areas it's weak in at stock speed. This is assuming your average retail sample overclocks better than your typcial Core i9-9980XE as mine did - that's something only time will tell and is something to bare in mind.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Intel's Core i9-10980XE<cite>Antony Leather</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>If you spend most of your time in Adobe Premiere Pro and exporting 4K content, for example, the Intel CPU is a much better bet, plus it was quicker in two out of the three games too, especially once overclocked. It's not a top to bottom win for Intel, though, and the AMD CPU is a much better option in a range of tests. It's also cheaper and requires a fraction of the cooling as well as having no need for quad-channel memory to dish out that performance.</p>
      <p>However, Intel's X299 platform offers more PCI-E lanes and is more mature, with plenty of affordable motherboards around. So even though it loses to the cheaper AMD CPU in a few areas, the fact that the Intel CPU offers more options when it comes to storage arrays and multiple graphics cards means that it retains an appeal that AMD's X570 platform cannot match. In this light, the two CPUs are more different than they are alike and aren't particularly comparable in terms of platforms. Sure, if you need maximum performance for the lowest heat and power consumption, AMD is best. If you need maximum performance in key areas such as gaming and Premiere Pro the Intel Core i9-10980XE is a great buy. AMD has undoubtedly stolen a few customers from Intel with its Ryzen 9 3950X, but hefty price cuts mean that the number of defectors are far less than they would have been. Plus, the X299 platform is just as much about bandwidth and I/O as it is about powerful CPUs.</p>
      <p>It will be interesting to see how Intel fares further down the Cascade Lake-X range, but overall, while not worth an upgrade from its predecessor, the Core i9-10980XE is part of a growing mix of CPUs where there are very few bad choices. There are plenty of areas where it's a great or even spectacular performer and those that need more PCI-E lanes than mainstream platforms offer, but have a budget of around $1,000 for a CPU will certainly not be disappointed.</p>
      <p>AMD still has one more trick up its sleeve, though, in 3rd Gen Threadripper and I'll be taking a look at it very soon indeed so make sure you add me to your favorites or follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/antonyleather">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Antonyleatherjournalist/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/crazytechlab">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/crazytechlab">Instagram </a>or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyTechLab">Reddit</a>.</p>
