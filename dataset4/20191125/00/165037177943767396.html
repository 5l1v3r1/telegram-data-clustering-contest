        <b>Kylian Mbappe has long been a reported target for Real Madrid and Zinedine Zidane has revealed he is more than a little fond of the forward.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a> boss Zinedine Zidane could once again face the wrath of <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/paris-saint-germain-fc/">Paris Saint-Germain</a> sporting director Leonardo <b>after declaring his love for </b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/k-mbappe-lottin-234474/">Kylian Mbappe</a>.</p>
      <p>Mbappe, 20, is consistently linked with a move away from the Ligue 1 giants, <b>where he has starred since arriving in 2017.</b> Zidane has long been an admirer of the France international and said last month it was Mbappe's dream to play for Los Blancos. That led to Leonardo responding: "<b>It annoys me a little </b>and it bothers me. This is not the time to talk about this. He still has two and a half years of contract with us. <b>It's time to stop all this</b>."</p>
      <p><b>Speaking ahead of Madrid's Champions League clash with PSG</b> on Tuesday, Zidane once again expressed his admiration for the World Cup winner. "You know that I have known him for a long time," he told a media conference. "<b>I am already in love with him</b>, firstly as a person, because he came to do a trial here a long time ago.</p>

      <p>"On Tuesday he comes as a rival. What matters to me is what we are going to do and we are going to prepare for it. <b>We know the player and we must be prepared</b>."</p>
      <p>Mbappe could line up alongside Neymar at the Santiago Bernabeu<b> after the Brazilian superstar made his first appearance </b>for a month in the Ligue 1 win over Lille on Friday. Zidane believes the pair will be named in Thomas Tuchel's starting XI and <b>expects a tough test against a side he ranks among the best i</b>n the world.</p>
      <p>"Nothing changes for me because I think Neymar and Mbappe are going to play," he explained. "<b>We are prepared in any case to play against any team</b>. PSG is a very good team. I think it will be a great game. Since the beginning of the season they have not had many failures; they have lost very little in the league.<b> I see a team that is progressing very wel</b>l. They are one of the best teams in the world. They will demand a lot from us and we know that. In the end, we're going to need a lot of things â€“ <b>our heads, our hearts and a lot of good football</b>. We need to work well with the ball."</p>
      <p>Madrid are five points behind PSG at the summit of Group A but <b>will qualify for the last 16 </b>if they overcome the French champions.</p>
