      <h1>West Ham United to offload Carlos Sanchez in January?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/west-ham-united/"><b>West Ham United</b></a> are reportedly considering letting midfielder <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/carlos-sanchez/"><b>Carlos Sanchez</b></a> leave the club on loan in January.</h2>

      <p>The 33-year-old came off the bench <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/west-ham-united-vs-spurs_game_92634.html">against Tottenham Hotspur</a> on Saturday; his first league appearance for the Hammers since late August and one that took his total minutes played in the top flight this season to 40.</p>
      <p>Sanchez's contract at the Olympic Stadium expires at the end of the season and now the <i>Daily Mail</i> reports that West Ham would be prepared to entertain loan offers for him in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/manuel-pellegrini/"><b>Manuel Pellegrini</b></a> signed the Colombian for Â£4m last summer from Fiorentina and he went on to start the Chilean's first three games in charge before a serious knee injury saw him miss most of the rest of the campaign.</p>
      <p>The former Aston Villa midfielder has since falling down the pecking order and he is now thought to be surplus to requirements, although it is not yet clear where he may move to.</p>
