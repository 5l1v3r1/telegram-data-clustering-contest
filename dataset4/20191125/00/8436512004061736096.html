      <h1>China’s Mighty Dragons are rightly feared</h1>
      <h2>Beijing’s Chengdu J-20 jet fighter might not be as advanced as the F-35, but its lethal missiles can shoot farther</h2>

      <p>Bang! — you’re dead. Shot down in flames.</p>
      <p>That’s how fast it happens in the air. One small advantage, can translate to winning … or losing.</p>
      <p>We all know how people at the Pentagon like to worry, especially when it comes to China’s military buildup. Now, they have something new to worry about.</p>
      <p>Back in 2018, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Air Force made waves at the Zhuhai Airshow with the latest showing of their flagship fifth-generation stealth fighter, the Chengdu J-20 Mighty Dragon.</p>
      <p>As is common with airshow coverage, large swaths of the ensuing commentary focused on the J-20’s handling and maneuverability as it performed a series of rolls and a climb.</p>
      <p>But sharp-eyed military watchers noted what is perhaps the most significant aspect of the J-20’s Zhuhai showing: its weapons system, reports Mark Episkopos of The National Interest.</p>
      <p>During the performance, the J-20 brazenly opened its missile bay doors to reveal four PL-15 missiles accompanied by two PL-10 missiles on either side.</p>
      <p>The PL-15 is a long range air-to-air missile which was slated to enter service in 2018. Outfitted with an active electronically scanned radar and featuring a reported maximum range of up to 300 km, the PL-15’s impressive specifications place it in the ranks of the top air-to-air missiles along with the European Meteor missile and Russian K-37M.</p>
      <p>So here is the problem. America’s highly touted fifth-generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter can’t shoot that far.</p>
      <p>The PL-15’s effective range in actual aerial engagements is certain to be lower than the maximum range 300 km, but is nonetheless much higher than its American AIM-120 AMRAAM counterpart’s estimated 180 km or less. Like it or not, that represents a big missile gap.</p>
      <p>American general Herbert Carlisle voiced serious concerns in 2015 when the development of the PL-15 entered the public knowledge: “Look at our adversaries and what they’re developing, things like the PL-15 and the range of that weapon.” General Carlisle raised the same issue in an interview with FlightGlobal: “The PL-15 and the range of that missile, we’ve got to be able to out-stick that missile.”</p>
      <p>The American F-22 and F-35 fighters are now equipped with the latest AIM 120-D missiles, but a massive range deficit remains nonetheless. So much for US air superiority.</p>
      <p>The challenge of the PL-15 comes on the heels of questions about the uncertain future of the aging AMRAAM system. As Captain James Stoneman put it to the <i>National Interest</i>: “Currently there is no program of record for a follow-on … we’ve probably close to maxing it out.” Development of the latest Block III iteration of the short range AIM-9X was cancelled, and <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/smr/2017/07/27/dod-slashes-amraam-missile-buy-as-raytheon-struggles-with-tech-refresh/">Raytheon struggles</a> with a necessary AMRAAM refresh.</p>
      <p>The J-20’s two side-mounted PL-10 missiles, while less conspicuous than their long range counterpart, are a key factor in the J-20’s operational versatility. A short-range infrared air-to-air missile, the PL-10 can be fired at off boresight angles of 90 degrees using the J-20’s Helmet Mounted Display. In other words, the PL-10’s on the J-20 can be fired in the direction that the pilot points their head.</p>
      <p>Off boresight targeting is by no means a new technology. In fact, the PL-10 is China’s response to the AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder short range missiles that the United States is selling to Taiwan.</p>
