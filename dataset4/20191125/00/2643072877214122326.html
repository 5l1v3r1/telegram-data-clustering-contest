      <p>The body of Charity Ohaka who hailed from Okporoworo community in Ogbakiri clan of Emohua Local Government Area of Rivers State was found in the well in Rumuosi four days after she was declared missing.</p>
      <p>Members of the Community had suggested that Charity was kidnapped before her dead body was discovered yesterday.</p>
      <p>A member of the Community, Goodnews said the body was discovered by those who were fetching water from the well and complained of seeing fleshy particles in the water and that it is oily.</p>
      <p>He said further that this followed stinks that discharged from the well and they decided to drain but to their surprise, they found the body of Charity in the well.</p>
      <p>The community also discovered that her ceiling was broken, giving another round of suspicion that it was the means her killers passed through to get into her building.</p>
      <p>But shortly after discovering the body of Charity, some youths of Ogbakiri caused havoc at Rumuosi town.</p>
      <p>The youths were seen destroying properties, vandalizing vehicles and looting shops up to the Rumuosi junction.</p>
      <p>The officers of the Rivers State Police Command came to salvage the situation.</p>
