      <h1>Mane matches Owen, Suarez record</h1>

      <p><b>When</b> Sadio Mane struck the opening goal at Selhurst Park on Saturday he achieved something only two other Liverpool players had done before.</p>
      <p>It is the fifth consecutive Premier League match against Crystal Palace in which Mane has scored.</p>
      <p>Only Michael Owen, against Newcastle United, and Luis Suarez, against Norwich City, had previously been able to string together such a sequence for Liverpool against the same Premier League opponent.</p>
      <p>Neither Owen nor Suarez made it six in a row so Mane could exceed their feats should he score against Palace in the reverse fixture at Anfield in March.</p>
      <p>Mane’s strike was his eighth goal in 10 Premier League matches against Palace, but he is not the south London sides’s ultimate nemesis.</p>
      <p>That would be Jermain Defoe, who scored nine Premier League goals against them.</p>
