      <h4>Kofoworola Belo-Osagie, Frank Ikpefan and Joseph Okwuofu</h4>
      <p>A Federal Government directive to varsity teachers to enrol on the Integrated Personnel Payroll and Information System (IPPIS) has pitted the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) against the Congress of University Academics (CONUA).</p>
      <p>The window for workers in the federal owned universities and Colleges of Education to enrol on the IPPIS platform opens today with both unions ditching out counter directives to their members.</p>
      <p>CONUA called on its members and other academics to embrace the payment system. But the ASUU leadership on Sunday renewed its earlier directive to its members to disregard the purported circular to enroll academic staff on IPPIS beginning from Monday.</p>
      <p>The circular originated from the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation (OAGF).</p>
      <p>In a statement by its protem publicity Secretary, Dr. Ernest Onyebuchi, the National Steering Committee of the group noted that CONUA aligned with the Federal Government’s anti-corruption campaign, which the IPPIS is out to achieve.</p>
      <h3>Read Also: <a href="https://thenationonlineng.net/ippis-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-asuu-fg-face-off/">IPPIS: What you need to know about the ASUU, FG face-off</a></h3>
      <p>The group expressed faith in the IPPIS, following the Accountant-General of the Federation’s explanations that the system had been designed to accommodate the perculiarities of the University system.</p>
      <p>The statement reads: “The union noted that the Office of the Accountant-General, in its recent newspaper publications has publicly demonstrated it has taken care of the major peculiarities of the university system and its autonomy in the implementation of the IPPIS.</p>
      <p>“Particularly laudable is the proposed establishment of an IPPIS desk in all federal university bursaries across the nation to continuously attend to issues arising from the implementation in an ongoing manner.</p>
      <p>“CONUA believes that any alternative payment platform for lecturers  being proposed or muted by anyone at this point in time will definitively compromise the standard of the IPPIS payment plan template, designed to formidably stem corrupt practices and bring accountability into the Federal Government’s personnel payroll system in universities and other agencies of government.</p>
      <p>“CONUA, therefore, reject the proposed selfish development of any form of alternative payment platform for lecturers by lecturers.”</p>
      <p>The union directed all its members to enrol on the IPPIS and called on other academics not to be afraid to register as well.</p>
      <p>It noted: “CONUA, therefore, mandates all its members to present themselves for the IPPIS biometric registration process by filling the forms for the purpose of enrolling into the IPPIS scheme.</p>
      <p>“In the same vein, CONUA urges all academics in Nigeria to shun any intimidation or call to attempt to truncate or frustrate the IPPIS scheme.</p>
      <p>“Moreover, CONUA warns that any attempt to truncate the smooth running of the academic calendar of universities by any group over the issue of IPPIS will be unacceptable. As such, members of CONUA and indeed all progressive-minded lecturers across the nation should not support any retrogressive move, tactics or antics in attending to issues arising from the implementation of IPPIS.”</p>
      <p>ASUU maintained that enrolling in the payment system as directed by President Muhammadu Buhari will undermine the autonomy of local varsities.</p>
      <p>ASUU President Prof Biodun Ogunyemi said that any attempt to forcefully capture lecturers on the payment system will make Nigeria a laughing stock among nations.</p>
      <p>Saying that the union has proposed a model for the government to test, Ogunyemi said that enrolling into the government payment system will take Nigerian universities back to the core civil service.</p>
      <p>He said: “Our position has not changed. We have no reason to change our position because to do so is to subscribe to a move that will undermine the autonomy of our universities and we believe that and we have proposed to the government that we have an alternative that will address all the issues that the government has raised about universities.</p>
      <p>“Government needs to test our own model rather than buying into a model that will take universities back to the core civil service. With IPPIS, before a vice chancellor can employ an academic staff the vice chancellor will have to get permission from the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation (HoCSF).”</p>
      <p>“Universities cannot be run within the framework of civil service bureaucracy. Universities are universal cities of knowledge creation no innovation and they can perform best when they are allowed to operate their system based on the laws establishing them.</p>
      <p>“The autonomy law that we have been talking about today recognises the peculiarity of universities and that is why they said governing councils should be the employers of academics, even up to the vice-chancellors, it is the governing councils that employ and not the civil service. To now say lecturers will have to get clearance from civil service before they can do what they can do.</p>
      <p>“It is ridiculous and it will make Nigeria a laughing stock in the comity of nations if the federal government should forcefully migrate our colleagues to IPPIS.</p>
      <p>“They are talking of corruption and we have shown them that there are three levels of checking corruption in the system. There is the internal audit, there is the external audit that is imitated by the governing council an there is visitation which is to be imitated by the visitor.</p>
      <p>“If internal audit system is not working well, the external audit system which the governing council is expected to do should be able to check any fraud in the system and where that one also fails, the government should exercise its power by visiting the universities at least once in every five years.</p>
      <p>“That is where the federal government is lacking. The last visitation they did to universities was eight years ago and in the last three years we have been shouting; we have been appealing to government.</p>
      <p>“We signed a memorandum of action (MoA) with government earlier this year and they promised that they will start visitation by March this year. Government didn’t do anything. This is November. When people say ASUU is encouraging corruption it is cheap blackmail.</p>
      <p>“If we allow this thing to happen we will localise Nigerian universities. That will discourage people that we can attract from all over the world to come and contribute to the development of our universities so that we can take enviable position in global ranking.</p>
      <p>“People are complaining that Nigerian universities are not ranking high. One major criterion of ranking is diversity of lectures and students. When you now treat everybody as part of your civil service, imagine somebody from Cambridge will go to Abuja to go and do data capturing for just three months.</p>
      <p>“Our colleagues in teaching hospitals have shown us that even when you enroll you can’t get your salary until three to four months after. Imagine somebody that came for short stay of two to six months that means that person will go without pay.</p>
      <p>“Nigerians should understand our perspective. Nigerians should encourage a situation that will localise our universities at a time everybody is talking of internationalisation.</p>
      <p>“We will destroy Nigerian universities with IPPIS if government should go ahead and force people to enroll. You can’t bring lecturers from all over the world and ask them to go and register in Abuja in the ministry. It is ridiculous. We have gone beyond that. They are taking us many decades back. It is sad.”</p>
