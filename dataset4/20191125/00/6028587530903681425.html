      <p>Ferrari isn’t used to losing.Its $250,000+ sports cars are the epitome of luxury, style, and exclusivity. When you see one cruising down the street, most people can’t help but stop and stare.</p>
      <p>Ferrari started as a racing company. Founder Enzo Ferrari handcrafted finely tuned speed machines whose sole purpose was to go faster than any other car could.</p>
      <p>Winning is in Ferrari’s blood. It has won a record 238 Grand Prix races. Yet recently, Ferrari looked like a loser.</p>
      <h3>The Hype Around Ferrari’s IPO Was Sky-High</h3>
      <p>On a cool October morning, eight pristine Ferraris sat parked outside the New York Stock Exchange in downtown Manhattan...</p>
      <p>For most of its history, Ferrari was a private company. It was owned by the Ferrari family and Fiat Chrysler. That all changed when Ferrari IPO’d on October 20, 2015.</p>
      <p>For the first time, individual investors could own a piece of the company... and many were dying to buy in.</p>
      <p>Ferrari began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker “RACE.” No surprise, hype was sky-high.</p>
      <p>Businesses don’t get much sexier than Ferrari. Ambitious young people dream of buying a Ferrari when they “make it.” Older folks buy Ferraris to feel young again.</p>
      <p>Ferraris are the ultimate status symbol. At $200,000+ a pop, most folks will never own one. Ferrari’s IPO was a chance for any investor to own a tiny sliver of the iconic brand.</p>
      <p>As you can imagine, Ferrari’s IPO was a media circus. CNBC reported that shares of the Italian carmaker were “well oversubscribed” heading into its IPO. That’s Wall Street’s way of saying demand was through the roof. </p>
      <h3>But Ferrari Stock Stumbled... Then Crashed</h3>
      <p>It suffered a disappointing first week of trading, slipping 6%. Ferrari then plunged 41% during its first four months as a publicly traded company, as you can see here:</p>

      <p>If you’ve been reading me, this story should sound familiar by now: <a href="http://www.riskhedge.com/go/v3cb77/for">big, hyped-up IPOs often fail to deliver.</a></p>
      <p>Ferrari went public at a $9 billion valuation. And at a price-to-earnings ratio of 33, it was priced for rapid growth.</p>
      <p>Problem was, Ferrari’s business will NEVER grow rapidly. It can’t! Ferrari is in the exclusivity business. Ferraris are special because they’re rare. The company keeps a strict cap on production to make sure they remain special.</p>
      <p>In 2015, before it went public, Ferrari sold just 7,000 a year. It has gradually ramped that up to 9,200 cars today... which is still tiny compared to automakers like Ford (F) that sell two-plus million cars a year.</p>
      <h3>Four Months after Ferrari Went Public, Things Were Looking Bleak</h3>
      <p>The stock had been nearly cut in half. But this was <u>exactly the right time</u> to buy Ferrari stock.It would bottom out and double over the next 12 months… and that was just the beginning.</p>
      <p>As you can see below, Ferrari has soared 431% since bottoming out in early 2016. That’s more than five times the S&amp;P 500’s return over the same period.</p>

      <h3>Ferrari Followed a Predictable Pattern…</h3>
      <p>I call this a <u>FAILED</u> IPO.</p>
      <p>Failed IPOs can make you a killing if you know how to play them. See, all the hype around Ferrari doomed its IPO to failure. It went public at too high a valuation, virtually guaranteeing its stock would decline.</p>
      <p>But although Ferrari’s IPO went poorly, its business was doing great. That’s an important distinction...</p>
      <p>Ferrari turns a big profit, year after year, selling luxury cars to rich people. Its business is rock solid. Ferrari makes an average of around $80,000 profit per car it sells. This blows most other carmakers out of the water. Even luxury carmaker Porche only turns a $17,000 profit per car, according to <i>Bloomberg</i>.</p>
      <p>Ferrari is one of few brands I’m <i>certain</i> will be around for many decades to come. Rich people will always want to own iconic cars, even with electric and self-driving cars coming. </p>
      <h3>This Happens All the Time with IPOs</h3>
      <p>A great business will suffer a failed IPO... handing you a chance to safely collect multi-bagger gains.</p>
      <p>Facebook (FB) had a failed IPO too. It went public in May 2012. It raised a staggering $18.4 billion in its IPO, putting its valuation at a colossal $104 billion.</p>
      <p>Its IPO was one of the most talked about investing events in history. But Facebook buckled under the pressure, just like Ferrari.</p>
      <p>FB plummeted 54% five months after its IPO.</p>

      <p>Of course, Facebook didn’t stay down. It’s now one of the biggest and most dominant companies on the planet.</p>
      <p>You would’ve made a good profit of around 400% buying Facebook at IPO. But you could have collected a GREAT profit of more than 1,000% by waiting and buying Facebook three months <i>after </i>its IPO.</p>
      <h3>Square (SQ) Followed This Same Predictable Pattern…</h3>
      <p>Square is a mobile payments company. It makes the little white boxes that plug into your phone to swipe credit cards.</p>
      <p>There was a ton of excitement around its IPO when it went public in November 2015. But the stock faltered, dropping 35% within two months.</p>
      <p>It was the chance of a lifetime to buy Square cheap. It would go on to soar nearly 1,200% in the next two and a half years.</p>

      <h3>Never Buy a Big, Hyped-Up IPO on Day 1…</h3>
      <p>Instead, identify the ones that are great businesses and “stalk” them.</p>
      <p>Let the hype fade. Let reality set in.</p>
      <p>Chances are you’ll get an opportunity to buy in for around half price within a few months... setting you up to collect double the profits of anyone who bought at IPO.</p>
