      <p>As temperatures drop, fashionistas will start mulling over how to pair that favourite sweater or jumper with a voluminous skirt or a flouncy dress. More often than not, pairing the two together has always looked awkward, and that’s why a new fashion hack has been receiving a lot of love online. Well, it has also become a rage in Bollywood. An Instagrammer has shared a genius trick of how to tuck that bulky sweater in and yet look chic.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to pull it off</b>
      </p>
      <p>To start with, you need to find a thin belt with a colour that’s similar to the sweater you have picked. Wrap the belt around your waist at the same height as you want the sweater to be tucked in. Tighten the belt over your sweater, ensuring there’s room to breathe. Pull up the sweater so that just an inch or so of the fabric remains below. Fold the rest of the sweater over the top of the belt to conceal it, and you are ready to step out.</p>
      <p>Another tip shared was to merely tuck one inch of the sweater in and let the rest hang out to achieve an effortless look. Pairing a tight skirt with a loose sweater was another option recommended. Other’s suggested using the excess fabric to tie a knot or to wear shapewear and tuck the excess fabric in there.</p>
      <p>Overall, if you are looking to nail this winter look, these fashion tips can definitely come in handy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tips and tricks</b>
      </p>
      <p>1. Use a thin belt to hold your sweater in as it’s being used as an aid to secure the sweater in place. Choose one that is similar to the colour of your sweater so that it does not clash.</p>
      <p>2. Tighten the belt over your sweater, and pull it up so that just an inch or so of the fabric remains below.</p>
      <p>3. Ensure that there is enough room to breathe, and the belt is not secured too tightly. And you don’t feel restrained.</p>
      <p>4. Fold the rest of the sweater over the top of the belt to conceal it, and you are ready to step out.</p>
      <p>5. The idea is to give some sort of shape to the outfit. Pairing a tight skirt or a fitted dress with a jumper works well, as the result looks effortless yet chic. Finish the look with a comfortable pair of sneakers.</p>
