      <p>LONDON, Nov 25 — Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are peddling fantasies before a December 12 election, former British leader Tony Blair will say today, offering his support to “mainstream” politicians.</p>
      <p>At a newsmaker event at Reuters, Blair will criticise Britain's main parties for offering voters a stark choice, wanting to win “on the basis that whatever your dislike of what they're offering, the alternative is worse.”</p>
      <p>Held after three years of negotiations to leave the European Union since a 2016 referendum, the December election will show how far Brexit has torn traditional political allegiances apart and will test an electorate increasingly tired of voting.</p>
      <p>Blair, who was prime minister for 10 years until 2007, will say many in Britain are “scratching their heads, changing their minds, floating and unsure” before the election.</p>
      <p>“The unifying sentiment is a desire, bordering on the febrile, to end the mess, to wake from the nightmare,” he will say, according to extracts from his speech.</p>
      <p>“This desire, though completely understandable, is in danger of leading us into a big mistake; and frankly we cannot afford another of those.”</p>
      <p>Blair will accuse both parties of offering up a fantasy to voters — the Conservatives suggesting they will get Brexit done when the reality is that they will start new talks on a future relationship which “could last for years.”</p>
      <p>Equally, he will say that Labour, under veteran socialist Corbyn, is offering a “revolution.” “The problem with revolutions is never how they begin but how they end.”</p>
      <p>He will call for people to look at the election seat-by-seat and back moderate candidates, saying he has been campaigning for such politicians in the Labour Party.</p>
      <p>“The polls predict a Conservative victory and put the chances of an outright Labour victory as negligible,” he will say. “But I wouldn't trust Boris Johnson with a blank cheque.” — Reuters</p>
