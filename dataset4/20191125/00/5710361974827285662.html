      <p>(Reuters) - Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks Inc reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue due to lower demand for its products, sending its shares down about 8% in extended trading on Monday.</p>
      <p>Revenue rose 18% to $771.9 million in the first quarter ended Oct. 31, but missed analysts' expectations of $767.8 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Net loss widened to $59.6 million, or 62 cents per share, from $38.3 million, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier.</p>
