      <h1>Cancer patients have an up to ten times increased risk of dying of heart disease, major research shows</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:05:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/laura-donnelly/" target="_blank">Laura Donnelly</a></address>
      <p>Cancer patients are at far higher risk of death from heart disease than the rest of the population, major research shows.</p>
      <p>The study found that the chance of dying from heart disease and stroke is almost four times higher in the first year after a cancer diagnosis, compared to the general population. Risks remained higher throughout the rest of life, especially among older patients. </p>
      <p>Experts said common cancer treatments - such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy - could increase the chance of heart disease.</p>
      <p>But they said it was also possible that lifestyle factors - such as being overweight, not exercising or drinking too much alcohol - which increase the risk of cancer, could also explain the increased risk of heart disease.</p>
      <p>The research, published in the European Heart Journal, compared the US population with more than 3.2 million cancer survivors.</p>
      <p>It found that, of people suffering 28 different cancers, 38 per cent went on to die from their cancer while 11 per cent died from cardiovascular disease.</p>
      <p>People with cancer had a higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease for the rest of their lives, but the risk was higher the younger somebody was diagnosed with the disease.</p>
      <p>Among people diagnosed with cancer before the age of 55 who went on to survive their cancer, the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease was over 10 times higher than that for the general population.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, most deaths from heart disease occurred in patients diagnosed with breast, prostate or bladder cancer - due to these being more common cancers. </p>
      <p>Overall, cancer survivors with cancer of the breast, larynx, skin, Hodgkin lymphoma, thyroid, testes, prostate, endometrium, bladder, vulva, and penis, were as likely to die from cardiovascular disease as they were to die of their initial cancer.</p>
      <p>Dr Kathleen Sturgeon, an assistant professor in public health sciences at Penn State College of Medicine in the US, who co-led the study, said: “These findings show that a large proportion of certain cancer patients will die of cardiovascular disease, including heart disease, stroke, aneurysm, high blood pressure and damage to blood vessels.</p>
      <p>"The risk of death from cardiovascular diseases is several times that of the general population in the first year of diagnosis; sometimes, this risk decreases, but for most, this risk increases as survivors are followed for 10 years or more.</p>
      <p>Martin Ledwick, head cancer information nurse at Cancer Research UK, said: “Doctors should be aware of this research as it suggests cancer patients need to be monitored more closely after treatment for heart disease and stroke.</p>
      <p>"But it doesn’t tell us why some cancer patients may be at higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.</p>
      <p>“For some, it might be treatment related - radiotherapy to the chest and some chemotherapy drugs can lead to a higher risk of heart disease.</p>
      <p>"But some of the cancers included in the study share lifestyle risk factors with cardiovascular disease, for example obesity and smoking, which might also explain the increased risk.</p>
      <p>"This is another reason why it’s important for everyone to have a healthy lifestyle.”</p>
      <p>Professor Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: “This large observational study provides further evidence that, compared to the general population, cancer survivors are at much greater risk of death from heart and circulatory diseases.”</p>
      <p>“We need more research to understand why this is and whether factors other than the known damaging effects of some anti-cancer treatments on the heart and blood vessels are at play.”</p>
      <p>“What is becoming increasingly clear is that cancer doctors and cardiologists need to work together from an early stage, to try and minimise the risk of patients surviving cancer but succumbing to heart and circulatory diseases.”</p>
