        <b>Mikel Arteta "works like a manager" says Pep Guardiola, who knows it may be hard for his assistant to turn down a mooted offer from Arsenal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola has conceded he is uncertain if<b><i> </i>Mikel Arteta<b><i> </i></b>will remain as his assistant for much longer </b>amid reports of Arsenal's interest.</p>
      <p>Former Gunners midfielder Arteta joined Guardiola's backroom staff in 2016 and has become highly thought of as an assistant coach as<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-city-fc/"> Manchester City</a> have stormed to domestic dominance. Arteta, who spent five years at Arsenal after signing from Everton in 2011, was linked with taking over from Arsene Wenger in 2018, <b>only for Unai Emery to be appointed instead</b>. Despite a run to the Europa League final last season, ex-Paris Saint-Germain coach Emery has failed to impress<b>, with reports suggesting he is on the brink of dismissal </b>following a poor start to the campaign.</p>
      <p><b>Arteta has again being referenced as a front runner for the job</b> should Emery leave his role. And, while emphasising his wish for Arteta to remain at City, Guardiola acknowledged <b>it may be difficult to keep his compatriot on board</b> beyond the end of the current campaign.</p>
      <p>"Emery is manager of <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/arsenal/">Arsenal</a>," Guardiola told a news conference when asked about the reports linking Arteta with a return to north London.<b> Of course [Mikel] will be a manager sooner or later</b>, if I was in his position, an assistant coach as young as he is [I'd want to be a manager too], but now we're going to finish this season. <b>In the future I don't know what's going to happen</b>.</p>

      <p><b>"I would like [Mikel] to stay with us as much as possible</b>. Manchester City has an incredible value for a person to work at this club for the future, but personal life is personal life, professional desires are professional for each person. <b>Everyone, not just me, is more than satisfied to have him here</b>, but what happens at the end of the season, I don't know."</p>
      <p><b>Guardiola also claimed Arteta's managerial credentials were clear</b> from early on in their working relationship, believing the midfield role <b>which both he and Arteta occupied</b> in their playing days provides the ideal platform for a coaching career.</p>
      <p>"He was an incredible player, normally with a holding midfielder they have a vision of all the pitch," Guardiola said. "<b>The holding midfielder is an incredible lesson </b>during your career as a player to learn what happens. You don't need to go to [coaching] school, he was so clever in that. More than that he is an incredible human being, work ethic, he works a lot. I said after a few months we were together that this guy would be a manager sooner or later. He is already a manager, he works like a manager. <b>That is why we're satisfied to have him here</b>."</p>
