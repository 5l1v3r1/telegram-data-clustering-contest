        <b>Mauricio Pochettino's dismissal was hard to take for Dele Alli, who felt responsible for the former Tottenham manager losing his job.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/b-ali-203578%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20DELE%20ALLI">Dele Alli</a> <b>has revealed he went to see Mauricio Pochettino</b> after he was sacked by <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a>, conceding he blamed himself for the Argentine's dismissal.</p>
      <p>Spurs relieved Pochettino of his position last Tuesday, after a dismal start to the season saw Tottenham sit 14th with 14 points from 12 Premier League games. <b>Jose Mourinho was appointed as Pochettino's successor</b> less than 12 hours later, with the former Manchester United and Chelsea manager overseeing a 3-2 win over West Ham in his first match in charge. <b>England midfielder Alli impressed in Saturday's triumph</b>, but confirmed he had been upset by the news of Pochettino's sacking.</p>
      <p>"<b>I think it's so clear what Mauricio meant to the players</b>. He was here for five years. He helped me grow a lot," Alli told a news conference ahead of Tottenham's Champions League meeting with Olympiacos - their first home game under Mourinho. I came here as an 18-year-old and had my ups and downs here and he's helped me through all of them. As soon as I found out the news I was very upset, but I wanted to speak to him.<b> It was just a conversation between two friends</b>. I've seen him more than I've seen my own family in the past five years so it's been very tough for me. But things change all the time.</p>

      <p>"We have a job to do, we've got to keep moving forward, but he's going to be someone I stay in contact with. <b>It'll be different because he's not my manager</b> but he's an amazing person who's helped me not just in football but my life as well. We spoke a lot about football when he was here, but I was very upset. I couldn't wait to speak to him and to see him. I think it was just important. <b>Our conversation wasn't too much about football</b>."</p>
      <p>Alli acknowledged<b> it was difficult not to feel guilty</b> over Pochettino losing his job.</p>
      <p><b>"I would be lying if I say I didn't blame myself w</b>hen it first happened rather than looking at the bigger picture," Alli said. "We've had some amazing journeys together, we grew together, all of the coaching staff and the players. <b>We achieved a lot in terms of where we've come from</b> and we're all very thankful. You can't help but feel a bit to blame because we were out there, but sometimes it just doesn't work out. Now as players, <b>we have a new manager here </b>and we owe the club a lot as well - we have to make sure we get back in good form and win games."</p>
