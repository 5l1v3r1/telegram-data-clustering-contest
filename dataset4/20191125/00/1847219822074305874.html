        <b>The council of the Bank of Latvia should take over functions of the management board, said candidate for the post of governor of the Bank of Latvia and member of the central bank’s council Mārtiņš Kazāks in an interview to <i>Latvijas Radio</i> on Monday, 25 November.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He outlined four main factors necessary to make the Bank of Latvia a powerful foundation for the country’s economic growth.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Kazāks mentioned there are many operations the bank can performed more cheaply without reducing their quality.</p>
      <h3>«There is room to improve efficiency. This applies to not only specific structures of the bank but also its management. It is definitely possible to reduce the number of management officers, starting with the top,» said Kazāks.</h3>
      <p>He said the Bank of Latvia currently has two-level management – council and board. However, in the future it is possible the council may take over functions of the board.</p>
      <p>«It seems to me it would be worth moving towards single-level management with just the council, which will take over management functions. A smaller number of people in the bank’s higher management would also be financially more efficient. It would also make decision-making quicker, and the management structure would become more democratic,» said Kazāks.</p>
      <p>He also said the Bank of Latvia may also provide considerably more support for the economy in fields like technology.</p>
      <p>«The Bank of Latvia may provide considerably more support for Latvia’s economy through development of inter-banking transactions, flash payments, making the economy more efficient and potentially increasing income for residents,» said the expert.</p>
      <h3>«This also applies to the public discussion – the central bank should be more open,» said Kazāks.</h3>
      <p>He said the Bank of Latvia may also become a stronger backbone for Latvia’s financial system.</p>
      <p>«The possible solutions to ensure the merging of the Finance and Capital Market Commission (FKTK) with the Bank of Latvia have already been outlined. I believe this would be a reasonable solution. By combining their functions under a single roof, I believe, support for Latvia’s economy in regards to growth of the financial sector would be clearer and stronger,» said Kazāks.</p>
      <p>He also said there are 480 employees in the Bank of Latvia, whereas FKTK has approximately 180. If the two institutions were to be merged, the total number of employees could reduce to approximately 520 over four years.</p>
      <p>As for the fourth task, Kazāks mentioned work in Europe.</p>
      <p>«The Bank of Latvia has one vote, like every other Eurozone member state, and is able to participate in discussions of Eurozone’s monetary policy to ensure correct decisions are made,» said Kazāks.</p>
      <p>At the same time, he stressed the Bank of Latvia should be involved in discussions about economy.</p>
      <h3>«The central bank should not be made an ivory tower, which every now and then opens shutters, says something and then goes away again,» says the economist.</h3>
      <p>«The central bank should be engaged in discussions about the economy, explain the economy and decisions, as well as listen to what is topical in the economy,» said Kazāks.</p>
      <p>As previously reported, in accordance with the decision made by Saeima’s Praesidium and Faction Council on Friday, 22 November, the period began for the selection of the candidate for the post of governor of the Bank of Latvia.</p>
      <p>In accordance with the Law on the Bank of Latvia, the governor of the central bank is elected by the Saeima following initiation from at least ten deputies.</p>
