      <h1>South African tech companies that pay the highest salaries</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>South African state-owned enterprises are struggling financially, and it is not difficult to see why – they pay very high salaries even though many of them are not profitable.</p>
      <p>The latest data available from the annual reports of JSE-listed companies and state-owned enterprises reveals that ICASA and the SABC pay higher salaries than most listed companies.</p>
      <p>ICASA had 364 employees at the end of its 2018/2019 financial year, up from 361 in the 2017/2018 financial year.</p>
      <p>The regulator’s personnel costs increased from R283 million in 2018/2019 to R303 million in 2018/2019.</p>
      <p>This means the average salary of ICASA employees increased from R783,966 to R832,413 over the past year. This is up from R676,004 in 2016/2017.</p>
      <p>Despite being technically bankrupt, the SABC is also paying very high salaries. The broadcaster pays its 3,167 employees an average salary of R762,000 per year.</p>
      <p>The SABC’s top 11 managers earned an average salary of R3.466 million per year, while senior managers received an average of R1.989 million each.</p>
      <p>Sentech – with 531 employees – paid its staff an average salary of R702,326, while the average salary at Broadband Infraco was R694,438.</p>
      <h3>Private sector</h3>
      <p>Vodacom paid its 7,746 employees a total of R6.1 billion in salaries, which translates into an average salary of R787,503. This is up from R741,329 one year ago.</p>
      <p>Over the last year, Telkom cut its number of full-time employees from 17,472 to 15,296 – a reduction of 12.5%.</p>
      <p>Telkom paid these employees R10 billion in remuneration and benefits, which translates to an average salary package of R656,969.</p>
      <p>MTN, which employs 18,835 people across Africa and the Middle East, paid its staff members an average salary of R504,380 per year.</p>
      <h3>Average salaries in South Africa</h3>
      <p>The table below shows the average salaries of prominent state-owned and listed ICT companies in South Africa.</p>
      <p>These salaries are based on the latest data available from the annual reports of JSE-listed companies and state-owned enterprises.</p>
      <p>While state-owned enterprises list the average personnel cost and average salary per employee, JSE-listed companies like Vodacom and Telkom do not provide this information.</p>
      <p>In these cases, we used the company’s total staff bill and divided it by the number of employees to calculate the average salary per employee.</p>
