      <p>Western Region Communications Director of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) Richard Kirk Mensah has been robbed.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kirk Mensah discovered on Sunday morning while preparing for church that his Tata Xenon double cabin pick-up has been broken into.</p>
      <p>“I was inside preparing for church when a neighbour who was passing by my house called me to ask what has happened to my car. I got alarmed and rushed out only to discover that the glass of the driver side door has been smashed.”</p>
      <p>“When I opened the door, I realized that some envelopes and documents had been taken away. On impulse, I opened the car bonnet and saw my car battery also gone,” he added.</p>
      <p>He indicated that the night before the incident he had some important documents in the car but took them out.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kirk Mensah is bemused that the incident could have happened when his car was parked few meters away from the gate to the residence of the Western Region Police Commander, DCOP Vincent Redeemer Dedjoe.</p>
      <p>“I am really shocked because the car was parked about 50 meters away from the house of the regional police commander. This is serious. Are we safe?” he sounded frustrated.</p>
      <p>When asked whether he suspected foul play, he parried that assumption away and said he will wait for the police to conclude their investigation.</p>
      <p>At the time of filing this report, Mr Kirk Mensah was on his way to report the incident at the Sekondi Police Station.</p>
      <p>Only last month the Takoradi Constituency Treasurer of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) Mark Ofori was shot dead in his house at Fijai in the Sekondi Takoradi Metropolis.</p>
      <p>Since the kidnapping of four young girls in the Sekondi Takoradi Metropolis, residents have had cause to complain about the deteriorating state of security.</p>
      <p>Apart from Mr. Ofori’s death, two other deadly attacks have been recorded.</p>
      <p>In both instances, the victims were shot dead in their homes.</p>
