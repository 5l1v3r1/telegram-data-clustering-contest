      <p>“What originally started as a joke has turned into a best-selling advent calendar across all categories (including chocolate!) at UK superstore, Asda.”</p>

      <p>Annem Hobson, founder of <a href="https://sowrongitsnom.com/">So Wrong It’s Nom</a> and creator of the world’s first cheese advent calendar, explains how she took the germ of an idea to a fully fledged product in under a year. With strong communications and a can-do attitude, she succeeded in developing her product, convincing retailers and cheese manufacturers that there was a clear gap in the market for it, and taking it into production.</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t believe there wasn’t a cheese advent calendar already out there given the level of interest. This inspired me to just have a go and see if I could make this happen.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Countdown To Christmas One Step At A Time</b>
      </p>
      <p>Once Hobson announced she would deliver her product by the following Christmas, the enormity of the challenge ahead dawned on her. With no experience in any of cheese production, packaging or selling to supermarkets, she had nothing more than 27,000 loyal newsletter followers and a strong track record in garnering media interest.  She started by picking up the phone.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Step One: Product Design</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hobson called everyone she knew, asking for contacts who could help or might know someone who can. This brought her a lawyer, a supermarket buyer, a licensing expert and even a photographer to do some promotional work.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Step Two: Production</b>
      </p>
      <p>The next challenge was sourcing a cheese manufacturer. Once again, Hobson faced her fears of rejection, picked up the phone and started talking. Half a dozen calls later, she had pitch meetings set up and found cheese manufacturer Norseland, who also produced miniatures. They were willing to take a chance on her and meet the upfront production costs.</p>
      <p>“This was probably the most challenging time; I worried that a larger cheese manufacturer would jump on the media bandwagon that I had created.” But this didn’t happen.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Step Three: Packaging</b>
      </p>
      <p>The next piece of the puzzle was finding a packaging supplier. Following further phone calls, this time to advent calendar producers, Hobson embraced the dual challenge of refrigeration and full Christmas fridges. This took trips to the local craft shop and a great deal of experimenting on the kitchen table.</p>
      <p>“We eventually came up with a bookcase design that after 12 days you tear the cardboard down the middle so you create more space.”  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Step Four: Pitching for Shelf Space</b>
      </p>
      <p>With a calendar producer on board, Hobson approached supermarkets, only to find they had already committed to their Christmas product ranges. She asked Norseland whether their supermarket contacts would help, but most said no. So she asked for an introduction to present the product herself.  One supermarket agreed first to a small trial and later increased their order.</p>
      <p>“In the first year they sold out and this is really when the business started to flourish.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hobson’s Building Blocks For Success</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Talk to friends and family for all the contacts and help they can give.</li>
        <li>Take a deep breath and pick up the phone to potential buyers and suppliers. “What is the worst that can happen?”</li>
        <li>Network with other entrepreneurs and ask for help. The people you meet can become great allies and a source of support and motivation.</li>
        <li>Don’t give up at the first hurdle – it is easy for your confidence to be crushed when you get a ‘no’ but it is critical to persevere.</li>
        <li>Focus on building up a social community – this can help not only with advertising and sales, but also with background data and research.</li>
        <li>Use the media – especially if you have an interesting product or story.</li>
        <li>Don’t abandon your early adopters and customers: involve them in your business journey.</li>
        <li>Test and seek feedback on your prototype before you spend money on it.</li>
        <li>Share your passion – if you are passionate, others will be too.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So, if you have an idea – test it, share it, have confidence in it. You never know what might be around the corner.</p>
