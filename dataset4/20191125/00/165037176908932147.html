      <h1>Lippi: Inter can maintain title bid</h1>

        <b>Marcello Lippi expects the Serie A title to be a closely fought battle between Inter and Juventus.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Title challengers <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/internazionale/">Inter</a> are capable of keeping pace with <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> <b>throughout the entire Serie A season</b>, according to Marcello Lippi.</p>
      <p><b>Antonio Conte's men notched up a fourth successive league win</b> with a routine 3-0 triumph at Torino on Saturday. Goals from Lautaro Martinez, Stefan de Vrij and Romelu Lukaku kept the pressure on champions Juve, who remain a point ahead after a 3-1 win over Atalanta. Some have suggested strength in depth will enable the leaders to pull clear as the season progresses, but <b>Lippi expects the title race to go down to the wire</b>.</p>
      <p>"It is very beautiful and it certainly made the start of the season very interesting," the ex-Italy head coach told Corriere dello Sport. <b>"I really think it can last until the end</b>. In August I thought that it would be a three-way fight for the title, but Napoli will struggle to get back into the race. [Carlo] Ancelotti is a very good coach and I am convinced that he will improve the team. However, <b>even if he drives them out of the difficult moment </b>he is going through, he has accumulated too much distance to the top. The championship will be more uncertain than in recent years and this is good for our football."</p>

      <p><b>Inter's only domestic defeat this term came at the hands of Juve</b> in October. Lippi praised Bianconeri boss Maurizio Sarri for<b> adapting well to the job he inherited from Massimiliano Allegri</b>. </p>
      <p>He said: "The change of coach could have negatively affected and created difficulties if Sarri had not been intelligent, <b>but Maurizio is intelligent</b>. He has already managed to implement some of his ideas without lowering the performance that Juve had with Conte first and then with Allegri."</p>
