      <h1>Finalists found in a high-scoring weekend of cricket</h1>

      <p>The one-day finalists were found during a busy metro premiership weekend which also saw the two-day competition get under way with a massive batting partnership.</p>
      <p>Old Boys Collegians and Lancaster Park will meet in the premiership one-day final on Sunday after both sides recorded comfortable semi-final victories. Meanwhile, there was a 317-run partnership between East Christchurch Shirley batsmen Timothy Hampton-Matehe and Leo Carter.</p>
      <p>Old Boys Collegians put on an imposing 358/6 at Hagley Park on Sunday, batting first against St Albans.</p>
      <p>After losing the early wicket of Tom Taylor, the side recovered with a 121-run partnership between Daniel Stanley and David Wakefield. Stanley went on to score an impressive 119 from 86 deliveries before being run-out in the 33rd over. However, the platform was laid for Old Boys Collegians' middle order to bat with freedom and set an impressive target.</p>
      <p>In reply, St Albans, which are the defending champions, got off to an impressive start and were 104/1 in the 19th over before the loss of Dan Sharples and Tyler Lorton in consecutive overs.</p>
      <p>A half century from James O'Gorman looked like providing a glimmer of hope for the Saints. However, a four-wicket bag from Harrison Cox saw Old Boys Collegians dismiss them for 288 in the 46th over and complete the 70-run win.</p>
      <p>At Garrick Park, Lancaster Park demolished Sydenham to book their spot in the final with a 182-run victory.</p>
      <p>Batting first Lancaster Park scored 256/6. Their key contributions came from Oscar Wilson (85) and Fynn Hudson-Prentice (63), who combined for a 94-run fourth-wicket partnership.</p>
      <p>Sydenham lost early wickets in the chase, and they were never able to gain momentum. Tim Johnston was the only batsman to put up any resistance with 44 before his side were dismissed for 83 in the 22nd over.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the two-day premiership began in style on Saturday when Timothy Hampton-Matehe (136*) and Canterbury rep Leo Carter (176*) combined for a 317-run third wicket partnership to help East Christchurch Shirley to an impressive advantage over Heathcote heading into the second day of matches on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The pair came together after the early dismissal of Jeremy Duncan and piled on the runs to both finish unbeaten when East Christchurch Shirley declared at 333/1 after 52 overs. They then rolled Heathcote for just 96 with Blake Coburn and Gooday both picking up three-wicket hauls.</p>
      <p>In other matches, Burnside West University will go in to day two with a 70-run advantage over Sydneham, St Albans will be looking to finish off Old Boys Collegians and Lancaster Park hold a 63-run lead against Riccarton.</p>
