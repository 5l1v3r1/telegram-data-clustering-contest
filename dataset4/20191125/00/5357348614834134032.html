        <b>The Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica (PSOJ) yesterday hailed its late president Beverly Lopez as a patriot and indomitable businesswoman after receiving news of her passing.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lopez, who led the PSOJ between 2003 and 2005, is reported to have died at her home yesterday morning.</p>
      <p>“She was tireless in her efforts to champion the development of the private sector, particularly for small businesses and exporters, at times in the face of daunting obstacles,” the PSOJ said in a statement, noting that Lopez was the second woman to hold the position of president in the organisation's history.</p>
      <p>“During her tenure at the helm of the organisation, she spearheaded a number of multilateral projects aimed at finding long-term solutions for exporters. Her legacy will remain forever etched in the annals of Jamaica's commercial history,” the PSOJ said, and extended condolence to her family and friends.</p>
      <p>Opposition Leader Dr Peter Phillips said he was saddened by news of Lopez's passing and described her as “an outstanding Jamaican, a well-respected and honoured business woman, and the champion of major social initiatives”.</p>
      <p>Phillips said Lopez's leadership of the PSOJ “demonstrated her love for her country, and she must be lauded for her instrumental role in the Social Partnership Agreement established in 2003 with the clear intention to provide the nation with private sector expertise and thought through dialogue with Government, trade unions, and other stakeholders.</p>
      <p>Phillips said sector leaders like Lopez worked tirelessly to build trust between the public and private sectors and in so doing contributed much to nation-building.</p>
