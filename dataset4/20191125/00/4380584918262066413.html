      <p>When you think of the offseason, you think of the biggest names and the largest deals -- understandably so -- but there's obviously a lot more that goes into it. <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/2018-19-mlb-offseason-analysis-for-each-move-c302712514">As we did last year</a>, we'll keep a running list of each one, with the latest moves at the top. We're probably not getting into every single non-roster invite, but you never know. Baseball fans are insatiable.</p>

        <b>Nov. 24, 2019: C <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/travis-d-arnaud-518595?stats=career-r-hitting-mlb">Travis d'Arnaud</a> <a href="https://www.mlb.com/braves/news/travis-d-arnaud-signs-with-braves">signs</a> with Braves</b>
        <br/>
        <i>Two years, $16 million</i>
      </p>
      <p>A decade after Braves GM Alex Anthopoulos first acquired d'Arnaud -- then bringing him from Philadelphia to Toronto as part of the Roy Halladay deal -- he does it again, giving him a two-year contract to replace <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/brian-mccann-announces-retirement">the retired Brian McCann</a> as Tyler Flowers's catching partner. For the Braves, it's the continuation of a busy start to the winter, as d'Arnaud joins Will Smith, Chris Martin, Flowers, Darren O'Day, and Nick Markakis as players who have agreed to either return to or arrive in Atlanta. For d'Arnaud, it's the end of a dizzying last twelve months that saw him <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/mets-designate-travis-d-arnaud-for-assignment">designated for assignment by the Mets in April</a>, get into a single game for the Dodgers, then pile up enough big hits for the Rays that he was <a href="https://www.mlb.com/gameday/rays-vs-athletics/2019/10/02/599335#game_state=final,lock_state=final,game_tab=box,game=599335">hitting cleanup for Tampa Bay</a> in the American League Wild Card Game.</p>
      <p>That tells you a lot about how up-and-down his year was, and it's true about his career too. Despite his first-round (37th overall in 2007) pedigree, and his role in two massive trades (he went to the Mets with Noah Syndergaard), he's had trouble staying healthy enough to ever be a regular catcher, having taken 400 plate appearances in a season just once, back in 2014. For all his Tampa Bay heroics, he was still a league-average hitter in 2019 (98 OPS+) which is about the same as he's been over his career (96 OPS+). Still, 'average hitters' are hard to find behind the plate, and with Yasmani Grandal off the board, the catcher market is thin. The Braves acted aggressively to come up with a second solid catcher, expecting neither Flowers nor d'Arnaud to play every day.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nov. 21, 2019: C <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/yasmani-grandal-518735?stats=career-r-hitting-mlb">Yasmani Grandal</a> signs with White Sox</b>
        <br/>
        <i>Four years, $73 million</i>
      </p>
      <p>A few weeks back, we said the White Sox could be "<a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/white-sox-can-be-the-breakout-team-for-2020">2020's breakout team</a>," because a long-running rebuild that had appeared to have stalled out after 2018 finally bore fruit in 2019, with Lucas Giolito, Yoan Moncada, Eloy Jimenez, and Tim Anderson all arriving and/or having long-awaited big seasons, with Luis Robert, Nick Madrigal, and Michael Kopech all expected to contribute in 2020.</p>
      <p>As we said at the time, while it was indeed true that incumbent James McCann had been an All-Star in 2019, every bit of statistical evidence indicates that it was something of a fluky hot start that couldn't be repeated -- to say nothing of his below-average framing numbers. That meant that for a team that seemed to want to make a big move, adding the best available catcher -- arguably <i>the best catcher,</i> period -- would be a big deal on both sides of the ball.</p>
      <p>That makes this a really, really big deal. Grandal had a .380 OBP and a .468 slugging in 2019, hitting 20-plus homers for the fourth straight season. He's been a consistent 10-to-20% better than average hitter for six years now; over the last three years, he's pretty easily been <a href="https://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=c&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=1000&amp;type=8&amp;season=2019&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2017&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0&amp;startdate=2017-01-01&amp;enddate=2019-12-31&amp;sort=17,d">the best hitting catcher in baseball</a>. Then there's the pitch framing, which we detailed in a piece counting down his possible homes earlier this week:</p>
      <blockquote><i>Obviously, the other selling point here is his elite pitch framing, which has also maintained a consistent level of excellence.

      <blockquote><i>Put that all together, and Grandal has been a star.

You get the idea. This is five straight star-level seasons.</i></blockquote>
      <p>Grandal, by himself, is not enough to put the White Sox into the playoffs. They still badly need at least two starting pitchers, to say nothing of an outfielder. But he improves the lineup, and he improves the pitching staff. It's the largest contract in White Sox history, and a huge move for a long-dormant team that clearly needed to make one.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nov. 19, 2019: P <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/chris-martin-455119?stats=career-r-pitching-mlb">Chris Martin</a> <a href="https://www.mlb.com/braves/news/chris-martin-signs-with-braves">signs</a> with Braves</b>
        <br/>
        <i>Two years, $14 million</i>
      </p>
      <p>Is it too soon to call the Braves the winners of the offseason? Probably, but also they're the only ones who have actually done something. The Braves have jumped all over what was already a pretty weak reliever market by bringing back Martin, originally acquired <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/chris-martin-traded-to-braves-for-kolby-allard">via trade from Texas</a> last July, after already importing Will Smith and retaining Darren O'Day. Martin's season was unfortunately marred by <a href="https://www.mlb.com/braves/news/chris-martin-exits-oblique-tightness-braves-cardinals-game-1">the oblique injury that knocked him out of Game 1 of the NLDS</a> before he could even throw a pitch, but he'd otherwise been outstanding -- 22 strikeouts against just 1 walk for the Braves, and a wild 65/5 K/BB for the 2019 season as a whole.</p>
      <p>Atlanta's bullpen now shapes up to start with Mark Melancon, Smith, Martin, Darren O'Day, Luke Jackson, Shane Greene, and possibly Sean Newcomb, if he's not in the rotation. That's looking like it could be a very strong group, and all Alex Anthopoulos had to do was not wait until after Thanksgiving turkey to get a move on it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nov. 13, 2019: P <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/will-smith-519293?stats=career-r-pitching-mlb">Will Smith</a> <a href="https://www.mlb.com/braves/news/braves-sign-will-smith-to-three-year-deal">signs</a> with Braves</b>
        <br/>
        <i>Three years, $40 million, with team option for 2023</i>
      </p>
      <p>Qualifying offer? What qualifying offer? Just hours before the deadline for Smith to accept or reject his offer from the Giants -- which he was <a href="https://twitter.com/Ken_Rosenthal/status/1195095866501029888">reportedly using as leverage</a> to get teams to submit their best offers before he returned to San Francisco for one year and $17.8 million -- the Braves stepped up with a three-year deal for the winter's best reliever, and one who grew up in Georgia, to boot. Over parts of three seasons with the Giants (half of 2016 and 2018/2019, since <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/will-smith-to-have-tommy-john-surgery-c220686380">he missed 2017</a> due to Tommy John surgery) Smith posted a 2.70 ERA and 193 strikeouts in just 136 2/3 innings, throwing his slider more than 40% of the time. He was at his best in 2019, posting a Top 10 strikeout rate (<a href="https://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=pit&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=50&amp;type=1&amp;season=2019&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2019&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0&amp;startdate=2019-01-01&amp;enddate=2019-12-31&amp;sort=7,d">37.4%</a>), and in 2018-'19 combined, Statcast quality-of-contact metrics have him as <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search?hfPT=&amp;hfAB=&amp;hfBBT=&amp;hfPR=&amp;hfZ=&amp;stadium=&amp;hfBBL=&amp;hfNewZones=&amp;hfGT=R%7C&amp;hfC=&amp;hfSea=2019%7C2018%7C&amp;hfSit=&amp;player_type=pitcher&amp;hfOuts=&amp;opponent=&amp;pitcher_throws=&amp;batter_stands=&amp;hfSA=&amp;game_date_gt=&amp;game_date_lt=&amp;hfInfield=&amp;team=&amp;position=RP&amp;hfOutfield=&amp;hfRO=&amp;home_road=&amp;hfFlag=&amp;hfPull=&amp;metric_1=&amp;hfInn=&amp;min_pitches=0&amp;min_results=0&amp;group_by=name&amp;sort_col=xwoba&amp;player_event_sort=h_launch_speed&amp;sort_order=asc&amp;min_pas=200#results">a Top 10 reliever</a>.</p>
      <p>That, combined with the relatively weak reliever market, makes this a strong add for an Atlanta bullpen that wasn't a strength; Smith, Mark Melancon, Darren O'Day, Shane Greene, and Luke Jackson make for a good start, plus Sean Newcomb, if he's not in the rotation. Entertainingly, the Braves claim that <a href="https://www.mlb.com/braves/news/braves-sign-will-smith-to-three-year-deal">Melancon will remain their closer</a>, with Smith taking important innings ahead of him. <a href="https://www.mlb.com/giants/news/giants-mark-melancon-expects-to-be-closer-c255158788">We've seen that show before</a>. Bet on it not remaining the same by June.</p>
      <p><b>Nov. 12, 2019: P <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/adam-wainwright-425794?stats=career-r-pitching-mlb">Adam Wainwright</a></b> <a href="https://www.mlb.com/cardinals/news/adam-wainwright-signs-new-deal-with-cardinals">returns</a> <b>to Cardinals</b><br/><i>One year, $5 million</i></p>
      <p>In 2017, Wainwright had a 5.11 ERA. In '18, he threw just 40 1/3 innings of 4.46 ERA ball. So <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/adam-wainwright-signs-with-cardinals-for-2019-c297632634">when the Cardinals brought him back for '19</a>, his age-37 season, you can see why it was for a mere $2 million, though with plenty of incentives. As it turns out, he was productive enough that he maxed out on all of them, <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/sports/baseball/professional/wainwright-maxes-his-contract-makes-million-for/article_521e2eaf-eb0d-5785-a4bb-5c3f4d56aacb.html">earning $10 million</a>, thanks to throwing 171 2/3 innings with a 4.19 ERA, making him basically a league-average starter. That's more than a little impressive at his advanced age with his limited velocity, and considering his status as a Cardinals legend -- '20 will be his 15th season and 16th year with St. Louis -- bringing him back for another year makes all the sense in the world. This time around, he gets a higher base salary of $5 million, with a chance for $5 million more in incentives. It's a move that makes sense for both sides, so long as the Cardinals don't stop here. They still need pitching depth.</p>
      <p><b>Nov. 8, 2019: Braves</b> <a href="https://www.mlb.com/braves/news/braves-sign-darren-oday">bring back</a> <b>P <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/darren-o-day-503285">Darren O'Day</a></b><br/><i>One year, $2.25 million, with a $3.5 million option for 2021</i></p>
      <p>O'Day was actually traded from Baltimore to Atlanta <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/kevin-gausman-darren-o-day-traded-to-braves-c288197586">in July 2018</a>, but due to right hamstring and right arm injuries, he didn't actually make his Braves debut until Sept. 7, 2019. At 37 years old, that's a rough profile to take into free agency, so a reunion makes sense, especially since <a href="https://www.mlb.com/braves/news/braves-sign-darren-oday">O'Day reportedly plans to live full-time in Georgia</a> even after baseball. He was effective enough, anyway, allowing one run in 12 regular-season and postseason games.</p>
      <p><b>Nov. 4, 2019: Braves</b> <a href="https://www.mlb.com/braves/news/nick-markakis-returns-to-braves">retain</a> <b>OF <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/nick-markakis-455976?stats=career-r-hitting-mlb">Nick Markakis</a> and C <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/tyler-flowers-452095?stats=career-r-hitting-mlb">Tyler Flowers</a></b><br/><i>One year, $4 million (plus $2 million buyout of previous option) for each</i></p>
      <p>The year is 2049. Ronald Acuña III is hitting leadoff for the Atlanta Hover-Braves. Nick Markakis has returned on his 31st consecutive one-year contract as he approaches his 5,000th career hit. That's a joke, obviously, but it does seem like Markakis is going to be playing for the Braves for the rest of time, doesn't it? So long as he's a platoon option, <a href="https://twitter.com/DOBrienATL/status/1191478879157927936">as he reportedly will be</a>, a low-dollar one-year deal for a reportedly plus clubhouse presence seems fine. The problem will be if this causes Atlanta not to add the offensive improvement it still needs, or if he gets another 600 league-average plate appearances, as often seems to happen.</p>
      <p>As for Flowers, Braves fans seem to dislike him because he hit .229 and led the Majors in passed balls, and he shouldn't be anyone's starter. That said, he hit 11 homers in only 310 plate appearances, and he <a href="https://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=c&amp;stats=fld&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=0&amp;type=1&amp;season=2019&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2019&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0&amp;startdate=2019-01-01&amp;enddate=2019-12-31&amp;sort=19,d">is a truly elite pitch framer</a>. For a few million bucks, that's a fantastic backup catcher.</p>
      <p><b>Nov. 4, 2019: P <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/chase-anderson-502624">Chase Anderson</a></b> <a href="https://www.mlb.com/bluejays/news/blue-jays-trade-for-chase-anderson-from-brewers">traded</a> <b>from Brewers to Blue Jays</b><br/><i>Brewers receive Minor League 1B Chad Spanberger</i></p>
      <p>Look, not every move that happens this offseason is going to be earth-shattering, but this one's more interesting than it might appear on the surface. Anderson has started at least 20 games in each of the past six seasons, and over the past three years, his 3.63 ERA (118 <a href="http://m.mlb.com/glossary/advanced-stats/earned-run-average-plus">ERA+</a>) is an above-average mark. (He also showed <a href="https://blogs.fangraphs.com/instagraphs/chase-anderson-brings-an-improved-cutter-to-the-blue-jays/">a very intriguing cutter</a>.) The 2019 Blue Jays had three pitchers make 20 starts, but both Marcus Stroman and Aaron Sanchez are gone, and Trent Thornton isn't exactly the ace of anyone's rotation. It's merely a start, but for a club that probably needs to add three or four starters this winter, a start matters.</p>
      <p><b>Nov. 3, 2019: P <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/aroldis-chapman-547973?stats=career-r-pitching-mlb">Aroldis Chapman</a></b> <a href="https://www.mlb.com/yankees/news/aroldis-chapman-extension-with-yankees">signs extension</a> <b>with Yankees</b><br/><i>One year, $18 million added to existing two years, $30 million</i></p>
      <p>When we looked at <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/predicting-the-tough-2019-20-qualifying-offer-decisions">this offseason's qualifying offer choices</a>, we noted that if Chapman opted out, he'd likely receive one, and "that all sounds messy, though, so the best outcome here might be that the two sides just agree to tack on another year or two rather than go through all of this."</p>
      <p>Well, yeah. That's exactly what happened. Despite the fact that Chapman's fastball is down to a career-low 98 mph, <i>that's still 98 mph,</i> and he's compensating by throwing his slider more, up to nearly one-third of the time in 2019. That pitch got him 41 strikeouts and a mere .159 average against, because it has the capability to make hitters who are geared up for the heat <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/sporty-videos?playId=d893982c-2f0b-4c00-aed6-44d6566125e8">look silly</a>. In order to keep one of the 10 or so best relievers around, the Yankees turned his two-year deal into a three-year, $48 million pact.</p>
