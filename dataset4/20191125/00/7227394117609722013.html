      <h1>Samsung Galaxy S11+ appears in Geekbench, its Exynos chipset lacks custom cores</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=12" target="_blank">Peter</a></address>
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy S11+ (SM-G986) has surfaced on Geekbench and as expected, it’s powered by the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s11_to_come_with_exynos_9830_sd_865_and_lpddr5_ram-news-39837.php">Exynos 9830</a> chipset. Naturally, there will be a Snapdragon 965 version for some regions.</p>
      <p>The benchmark reveals that the phone packs 12GB of RAM, which matches the maximum configuration of the S10+. Whether or not there will be an 8GB version this time around remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, the Galaxy S11+ ran Android 10 for the benchmark. Samsung has been busy updating current models to v10, which also comes with One UI 2.0.</p>

      <p>There’s not much to say about the benchmark results, however. The single-core result is lower than the Exynos 9825, suggesting that the hardware, the software (or more likely) both are unfinished.</p>
      <p>What’s inside the 9830 chipset? The full details are unknown, but it seems that Samsung is dropping the custom cores for the next high-end chip. Based on this report, it seems to have two clusters of four cores each (unlike previous chipsets, which had a 2+2+4 configuration). We knew Samsung <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_is_shutting_down_its_custom_cpu_core_department_will_license_arm_cores_instead-news-39940.php">shut down its custom core division</a>, we just didn’t expect it to have an effect until the S12 generation.</p>

      <p>Anyway, the new chipset will need to show a higher performance to keep up with the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s11_may_have_120_hz_display-news-40189.php">120Hz screen</a> (a <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s11_tipped_to_come_in_three_sizes_and_five_variants_in_total_depending_on_5g-news-40024.php">6.9” Dynamic AMOLED</a> panel with QHD resolution). Additional rumored specs include <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s11_series_launch_date_specs-news-40218.php">108MP main camera and 48MP telephoto</a> with 10x lossless and 100x hybrid zoom. The plus model is expected to have 5G connectivity while the smaller models will come in 4G and 5G flavors.</p>
