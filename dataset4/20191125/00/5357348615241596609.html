      <p>TELECOMS provider Digicel says Christmas moments this year will be better shared in its My Digicel app.  <br/>“With the season of giving right around the corner, Digicel will be making its customers' wishes come true when they download the app, purchase a plan, tap the Shake It icon, and shake their phones to win up to $10 million in the Digicel Shake to Win game,“ a company release said.</p>
      <p>It said one lucky customer will walk away with the grand prize of $10 million in one of the biggest Christmas cash giveaways ever. The runner-up prize of a Digicel Family Pack comes with two Samsung Galaxy Note 10s and two Samsung A80 LTE smartphones, plus one year of free postpaid mobile service for four family members.</p>
      <p>“Digicel customers can win the $100,000 daily prize or the $200,000 weekly prize on Saturdays, at any time from 6:00 pm to midnight. Other daily prizes include Samsung A50 smartphones, and Samsung A80 smartphones on Saturdays. Data plans, D'Music Premium Access plans, talk time and credit make it a whopping $30 million in cash and prizes,” said the releas.</p>
      <p>According to the telecoms company, to ensure that every participant wins a prize this Christmas, MyDigicel app users are guaranteed to win when they shake on Saturdays while on any qualifying mobile plan.<br/>To gain entries to shake for daily prizes and the grand draw, prepaid customers must download the MyDigicel app, activate a Nuff plan, Unlimited Social, or receive a Stay Connect plan from abroad. Postpaid customers must be on a Freedom plan, or purchase an add-on to that plan.</p>
      <p>“Christmas is all about family and friends. It's about sharing and reconnecting with the people we love. And it's a time for more; more fun, more excitement, more laughter, more everything. This means that as we become a digital lifestyle partner for our customers, we want to be with them every step of the way – for the everyday moments, the special moments and the shared moments like Christmas,” said  brand marketing manager for Digicel Jamaica Ayanna Kirton.</p>
      <p>In addition to multiple prize-winning shakes, the marketing manager said Digicel customers will enjoy the widest LTE coverage and superfast mobile data speeds while they connect and share all their exciting Shake to Win moments.</p>
      <p>“We're super excited about shaking things up this Christmas with our customers, and in the true spirit of sharing we're inviting everyone to join Digicel this Christmas, get in on the winnings and stay for the amazing LTE network experience,” said Kirton.</p>
