      <h1>Trump nominates ambassador to Norway to replace Navy secretary fired over SEAL Eddie Gallagher controversy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:01:45+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Carlin Becker</a></address>
      <p>President Trump announced his intentions to nominate Ambassador to Norway Kenneth Braithwaite as his administration's next secretary of the Navy.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/pentagon-chief-asks-navy-secretary-to-resign-for-handling-of-seal-eddie-gallaghers-case">dismissed Navy Secretary Richard Spencer</a> over his handling of SEAL Eddie Gallagher's case. Spencer had gone behind Esper's back to present the White House with a private proposal that would have allowed Gallagher, who was accused of war crimes, to retire as a Navy SEAL with his Trident insignia if the administration stayed out of the proceedings against him.</p>
      <p>"I was not pleased with the way that Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher’s trial was handled by the Navy. He was treated very badly but, despite this, was completely exonerated on all major charges," the president tweeted later that night. "I then restored Eddie’s rank. Likewise, large cost overruns from past administration’s contracting procedures were not addressed to my satisfaction."</p>
      <p>He continued, "Therefore, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer’s services have been terminated by Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. I thank Richard for his service &amp; commitment. Eddie will retire peacefully with all of the honors that he has earned, including his Trident Pin."</p>
      <p>Finally, he announced Briathwaite as Spencer's replacement, writing, "Admiral and now Ambassador to Norway Ken Braithwaite will be nominated by me to be the new Secretary of the Navy. A man of great achievement and success, I know Ken will do an outstanding job!"</p>

      <p>Spencer's proposal for the White House followed the president's <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-clears-three-military-members-accused-of-war-crimes">intervention on Nov. 15</a> to clear three military members accused or convicted of war crimes, including Gallagher, who was acquitted this summer of murder charges stemming from his 2017 deployment to Iraq but was found guilty of taking a photo with the body of an ISIS fighter he was accused of murdering.</p>
      <p>The Navy, however, had been considering striping Gallagher of his SEAL Trident, something Trump publicly opposed, when Spencer approached White House officials with the secret deal. Despite firing Spencer over the matter, Esper has decided to allow Gallagher to remain a SEAL.</p>
      <p>Braithewaite, 58, is currently U.S. ambassador to Norway and is a retired Navy rear admiral. Having joined the Navy in 1984, he was also Commanding Officer of the Navy Combat Camera Command during the Iraq invasion in 2003. He joined the Navy Reserves after his active duty service ended and retired in 2011. His nomination came at the suggestion of Esper.</p>
