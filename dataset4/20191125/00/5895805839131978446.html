      </p>
      <p>I was watching Christine de Blasey Ford’s Senate testimony with a woman in her 30s, who told me that the times she’d been hit on by professors and employers were beyond counting. I wondered, has anything really changed? As I recalled the slew of unwanted advances I had experienced as a young woman, a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/memory">memory</a> that lay buried for decades sprang into focus.</p>
      <p>It was 1973. I was 18—bright, ambitious, a feminist from New York City at a small Midwestern college. One night, I was leaving the library with Michael, my boyfriend and first love. He wanted to go back to my room to keep studying, but I was restless and decided to meet some friends for the opening of a visiting artist’s show. I told him I’d be back home later.</p>
      <p>Andy, a lively, urbane British artist, was in his 40s—a real stand-out amid our faculty in his bell bottoms, platform shoes, and wild, frizzy hair. After the exhibit, he invited me and a few friends to his house off campus. I felt flattered, cool.</p>
      <p>He poured us some wine and joints were passed. I must have gotten pretty high because between chatting agreeably with Andy at the party and finding myself underneath him on a couch, naked, after <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sex">sex</a>, I didn’t remember a thing.</p>
      <p>Disoriented, I shuffled home through the snowy, lamplit streets. I got back to my room around 2 am, undressed in the dark, and crept into bed. Michael was awake. He asked where I’d been so long.</p>
      <p>It never occurred to me to lie. When I finished the tale, he got dressed and left, saying, “I can never touch you again.” I pleaded, but he was gone.</p>
      <p>My life changed radically after that night. A diligent student, I became too depressed to study and stopped going to classes. Our campus was tiny—I couldn’t go outside without bumping into Michael, who started sleeping with first one, then another, of my friends.</p>
      <p>About to flunk out, I sought out the school psychologist. I told him my boyfriend had dumped me, and all I could do was sleep or cry. The therapist suggested a leave of absence.</p>
      <p>I left school and traveled for a year, shrouded in sadness and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/embarrassment">shame</a>. I was stunned that the man who had said he loved me tossed me away like so much garbage. But I wasn’t angry at Michael—or at Andy. I was angry at myself.</p>
      <p>I saw what had happened as my responsibility, my transgression, just as Michael did. I’d made a choice, and it had cost me a man I loved. I didn’t see myself as victim or Andy as predator. I didn’t question being in control—of the situation or my body. As a feminist, I saw Andy as my equal and the situation a seduction—perhaps on both our parts. Did I <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/flirting">flirt</a> with him? I was too out of it to know.</p>
      <p>Stunning as I find it now, it never occurred to me to tell the therapist that having sex with a professor had precipitated my break-up. But there’s no way to understand an experience except through the cultural moment you’re in.</p>
      <p>To see Andy’s behavior as wrong, actionable, meant seeing myself as needing protection, and that went against my feminist grain.</p>
      <p>I had renounced women’s victimhood and weakness; I believed that made me powerful. I was wrong. In fact the most crushing part of the experience was realizing my own powerlessness. All I wanted was for Michael to take me back. I saw my worth through his eyes. If he found me unacceptable, then in what universe was I acceptable?</p>
      <p>Viewing that night and its aftermath through the lens of the current cultural moment, my fury rises. I see so clearly Michael’s egotism, Andy’s willingness to take advantage of a student too powerless to resist, and the therapist’s failure to help me cope with my <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression">depression</a>, restore my sense of agency, perhaps see things in a different light. Instead, he just told me to go away.</p>
      <p>I asked my young female companion if she had ever lodged complaints against the men who had harassed her. “Yeah,” she said, glumly. “But nothing happened.” Troubling as that is, I’m somewhat heartened: at least she knows better than to blame herself.</p>
