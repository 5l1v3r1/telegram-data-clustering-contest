      <p>The recent crop of cyberdeck builds are inspired, at least tangentially, by William Gibson’s novel <i>Neuromancer</i> and its subsequent sequels. In the novels, the decks are used as mobile terminals to access the virtual reality of cyberspace. In our world, they’re usually just quasi-retro boxes with Raspberry Pis in them. Artistic license and all that. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/pRgKOY7">But the “XMT-19 Cutlass”, a deck built by [CaptNumbNutz]</a>, attempts to hew more closely to the source material than most builds we’ve seen.</p>
      <p>Of course it won’t be transporting you into the matrix, and ultimately it’s still just a casemod for the Raspberry Pi. But at least it does a fantastic job of fitting the <i>Neuromancer</i> motif. The design is supposed to look like the XMT-19 was a piece of high-tech military hardware that was later co-opted by a cyberspace cowboy operating in the urban megatropolis that Gibson called the Sprawl, with exposed wiring and a visual mish-mash of components.</p>

      <p>If you can believe it, the build started out as a locking clipboard of all things. From there, [CaptNumbNutz] started layering on the hand-cut foam greebles and spraying on the WWII inspired color scheme. We especially like the yellow tips on the antennas that invoke the propellers of vintage airplanes, and the serial number stenciled onto the bottom. In a departure from basically every other cyberdeck we’ve seen to date, there appear to be no 3D printed elements on the XMT-19; all the parts are hand made with nothing more than an a sharp knife and a heap of patience.</p>
      <p>In terms of the electronics, the whole build has been greatly simplified by the use of a SmartiPi Touch case, which integrates the Pi and touch screen into a single hinged unit that just needed to get bolted to the top of the deck. Plus it gave him an excuse to put a big rainbow ribbon cable on the back of it to reach the Pi’s GPIO ports, which as you know, instantly makes everything look more retro-futuristic.</p>
      <p>It might not be packing <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/07/28/a-mobile-computer-to-make-william-gibson-jealous/">the raw power of the Intel NUC cyberdeck we covered last year</a>, or have the <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/09/20/3d-printed-virtuscope-is-a-raspberry-pi-4-cyberdeck-with-a-purpose/">convincingly vintage look of the VirtuScope</a>, but we’d take the XMT-19 Cutlass into the matrix any day.</p>
