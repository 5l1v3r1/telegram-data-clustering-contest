      <h1>Retailers charging £300 'return fees' came top of Google Shopping results, Which? investigation finds</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:01:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/mike-wright/" target="_blank">Mike Wright</a></address>
      <p>Google promoted retailers that charged up to £300 to return items because as where able to pay to come top of search results, an investigation by Which? has found.</p>
      <p>The consumer watchdog uncovered a number of retailers topping searches for popular gadgets who imposed extra charges, including shipping fees to return items to Hong Kong, which breached UK consumer law.</p>
      <p>The findings come ahead of the Black Friday and Cyber Monday pre-Christmas online sales this week, in which UK shoppers spent over £1.5 billion last year.</p>
      <p>Following its investigation, Which? warned shoppers to be wary of deals from little-known brands even if they were highly ranked in search terms.</p>
      <p>Google said it required all its retailers to comply with local laws, and Which? said two retailers changed their terms as a result of the investigation.</p>
      <p>The watchdog said it was also passing on its findings to the Competition and Markets Authority, which is conducting an investigation into digital advertising.</p>
      <p>Which? researchers looked at a number of retailers that came top of Google Shopping results for popular tech items such as the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 phone as well as Apple’s iPhone 11 and AirPod headphones. </p>
      <p>Although many of the top-ranking companies were based abroad they are subject to UK consumer law if they deemed to be advertising directly to British consumers by pricing items in sterling and having UK website domains.</p>
      <p>Which? found one company, eGlobalcentral UK, which is based in Hong Kong, charged £15 if orders were cancelled after shipping and levied a “restocking fee” of between £30 and £300 if its terms were not met for returned items.</p>
      <p>The company’s terms also said it would only accept returned goods “in brand new condition” and in the original packaging, against consumer rights of return.</p>
      <p>Another Hong Kong-based company, TobyDeals said customers could face a £20 administration fee if they cancelled after an order has been processed and warned of a £50 restocking fee for any missing accessories. </p>
      <p>Which? said the company also specified that customers pay for the shipping back to Hong Kong for any returned item. However, it said TobyDeals amended its terms following the investigation.</p>
      <p>Adam French, Which? Consumer Rights Expert, said: “It seems wrong that firms that breach consumer laws can pay Google to secure prominent slots at the top of shopping search results.”</p>
      <p>Google Shopping generates revenue using a cost-per-click model, where retailers only pay when a customer clicks through to their website. </p>
      <p>However, retailers are able to bid on how much they are willing to pay per click, with higher bids usually coming higher in search results. </p>
      <p>A spokesman for Google said: “Because we want the Shopping Ads you see on Google to be useful, relevant, and safe, we have robust policies describing what we do and don’t allow on our ads platform. In addition, we require the merchants who use our platforms to adhere to local law.</p>
      <p>“As such, we have disapproved and removed their Shopping Ads in the UK.”</p>
