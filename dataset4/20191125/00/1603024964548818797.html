      <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday asserted that the BJP governments at the Centre and the state would continue to protect Jharkhand's 'jal', jungle and 'zameen' (water, forest and land).</p>
      <p>Addressing a poll meeting here, the prime minister congratulated Chief Minister Raghubar Das for completing his five-year term, a first in Jharkhand since it attained statehood in 2000.</p>
      <p>Condemning last week's Naxal violence in the poll- bound state, the PM also paid tribute to the four policemen who were killed in the attack.</p>
      <p>"The BJP govt has provided good governance in Jharkhand over the past five years. That is why, for the first time in the state's history, a chief minister completed his five-year term," he noted.</p>
      <p>Modi insisted that the Jharkhand government had worked day and night to end corruption over the last five years.</p>
      <p>"The BJP governments at the Centre and the state will continue to protect Jharkhand's 'jal', jungle and 'zameen' (water, forest and land), no matter what the opposition says.</p>
      <p>The state has made efforts to curb naxalism in the state and will continue to fight against the menace," he added.</p>
