      <p>It has a strong presence in South India, particularly Kerala (65 percent of branches) and Tamil Nadu (14 percent), where it has built strong relationships with its customers. This is well reflected in stable deposit base and improved renewal rate from 88 percent in FY17 to 97 percent in FY19 and 98 percent in first half of FY20, despite reducing rates this fiscal.</p>
      <p>"At the upper price band, the issue is valued at 2.4 times H1 FY20 P/B on a post-issue diluted basis. After the acquisition by Fairfax group, the realigned operational strategy has helped the company to report profits in first half of FY20. The company is focused to improve profitability and growth going forward," Motilal Oswal said in a recent report.</p>
      <p>The brokerage believes that given the strong promoter backing and turnaround in profitability, investor can subscribe to the IPO for listing gains.</p>
