      <h1>Chris Smalling Follows in David Beckham's Footsteps With Outstanding Serie A Showings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/14401747" target="_blank">Tom Gott</a></address>
      <p>​All around the football world, one of the biggest surprises of the season has been Chris Smalling's phenomenal form on loan with Roma.</p>
      <p>The centre-back, who had spent years being ridiculed with Manchester United, has exploded onto the scene in the Serie A. Smalling has been incredible defensively and played a starring role in his side's 3-0 win over Brescia on Sunday.</p>

      <p>Smalling finished the game with an assist and his goal, taking his tally for the season to two strikes. As noted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OptaPaolo/status/1198621545033338885?s=20">​Opta</a>, he is the first English player to net twice in a single <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/serie-a">​Serie A</a> campaign since David Beckham did so back in the 2008/09 campaign.</p>
      <p>That's testament to just how well Smalling has adjusted to life in Italy. He has done something which could not be managed by prolific English goalscorers like Ashley Cole, Micah Richards or... Joe Hart?</p>
      <p>On a serious note, the only attacking players who he has bested are Rolando Aarons, Stephy Mavididi and Ravel Morrison, so it's not exactly the greatest claim to fame for Smalling.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, as a centre-back, you can't deny just how impressive Smalling has been for Roma. His partnership with fellow loanee Gianluca Mancini has left fans drooling, and the duo have been vital to Roma's push for <a href="https://www.90min.com/categories/champions-league">​Champions League</a> qualification this year.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, Roma are incredibly keen on making his loan move permanent. They have no option to buy him as part of the deal, so the Serie A side will have to negotiate with <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-united">​United</a> once more.</p>
      <p>The two clubs are understood to be discussing a <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6497807-manchester-united-to-meet-with-roma-to-discuss-18m-chris-smalling-deal">​potential €18m deal</a>, although Roma are hopeful of negotiating a slight discount after already paying a loan fee to take Smalling in the first place.</p>

      <p>There's even talk that both <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6499384-juventus-inter-join-race-for-chris-smalling-after-impressive-start-with-roma">​Inter and Juventus are interested in recruiting the centre-back</a>, which speaks volumes of just how well Smalling has been performing this year.</p>
      <p>As it stands, he is set to return to United once his deal expires at the end of the season, but a lot can change between now and then.</p>
