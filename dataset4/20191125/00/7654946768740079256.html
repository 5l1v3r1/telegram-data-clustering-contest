      <h1>How the NYPD’s fingerprint database got shut down by a computer virus</h1>

      <p>The NYPD’s high-tech fingerprint database was temporarily brought down by a bumbling contractor with a virus-infected mini computer, The Post has learned.</p>
      <p>A contractor was setting up a digital display at the police academy in Queens on Oct. 5, 2018, when he plugged in a tainted NUC mini-PC — and it transmitted an unidentified virus to 23 machines linked to the department’s LiveScan fingerprint-tracking system, the NYPD confirmed.</p>
      <p>Cops realized within hours that there had been a breach, according to Deputy Commissioner for Information Technology Jessica Tisch, who said the department’s cyber command and the Joint Terrorism Task Force were notified of the contamination.</p>
      <p>“We wanted to get to the bottom of this,” Tisch said. “Was this plugged in maliciously was really important for us to get to the bottom of this.”</p>
      <p>The virus — generally referred to as “ransomware” because it locks users out of infected computers until they pay a ransom — “never executed,” but the NYPD shut down LiveScan that night and reinstalled software on 200 computers citywide out of an abundance of caution, she said.</p>
      <p>“By Saturday early morning — I remember it was still dark out — we were bringing the system online,” Tisch said.</p>
      <p>The vendor, who was not identified, was questioned but not charged with wrongdoing. A department spokeswoman said the breach impacted .1 % of the department’s computers.</p>
      <p>While the NYPD dodged a bullet in this case, experts say breaches in public databases are a serious security issue and a growing concern.</p>
      <p>“There’s always a concern that, if there’s a breach, that information would be stolen,” said Adam Scott Wandt, a professor of cyber security at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. “Hackers might be able to find out what type of open cases are out there.”</p>
      <p>“It’s a fairly complex world that we live in,” he added. “Everything is linked together. Government normally does a fairly good job of keeping hackers out, but every now and then there is a breach.”</p>
      <p>The NYPD database is tied to the Statewide Automated Fingerprint Identification System, which contains about 7 million files, according to the state Division of Criminal Justice Services.</p>
      <p>Until this month, the NYPD also maintained <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/nypd-finally-deletes-illegal-database-of-youth-fingerprints/">an illegal database of juvenile fingerprints</a> that it was required to expunge years ago.</p>
      <p>“If there was a breach prior to the expunging, then, yes, people would obviously be able to get access to that,” Wandt said of the illicit youth prints. “However, I think that the NYPD is not unique, that these are the same worries if there was a breach in any criminal justice database.”</p>
      <p>In January, hackers broke into the Oklahoma Department of Securities database, leaving <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/oklahoma-gov-data-leak-exposes-millions-of-department-files-fbi-investigations/?ftag=CAD2e14604">millions of government files unprotected</a>, including records pertaining to FBI investigations dating to 1986.</p>
      <p>In May, US Customs and Border Protection acknowledged that photos and license plates of travelers were compromised <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/10/politics/customs-and-border-protection-images-travelers-data-breach/index.html">due to a breach of a subcontractor’s network</a>.</p>
