      <p>A high-level delegation from Amhara regional state of Ethiopia has arrived in Washington DC, United States, on Monday, reported Amhara Mass Media Agency (AMMA).</p>
      <p><a href="https://borkena.com/2019/05/25/interview-with-yohannes-buayalew-part-ii/">Yohannes Buayalew</a>, head of Amhara Democratic Party (ADP) office, led the delegation while Melaku Fanata, Central Committee Member of ADP is in the team.</p>
      <p>Ethiopian Ambassador to the United States, Fitsum Arega, welcomed the leaders of the delegation upon arrival in Washington D.C. </p>
      <p>As well, members of Ethiopian community from the region living in Washington area have also warmly welcomed Yohannes and members of his delegations.</p>
      <p>It is tasked to hold a discussion on ways of supporting the Amhara Development Association (ADA) and Ethiopian current Affairs, according to AMMA report.  It also aims to have a consultation on the region’s economic, social and political affairs, the report added.</p>
      <p>Atlanta, Washington-DC, Ohio, Denver, Minnesota, Seattle, and Toronto are among the cities where there will be town hall meetings.</p>
      <p>In a related development, AMMA reported on Monday that the “United Amhara Charitable Association” is to be established. The founding congress will take place in Addis Ababa on December 1, 2019.  The organization aims to provide emergency aid to ethnic Amhara communities affected by various problems. </p>
      <p>Based on numerous reports of violence and displacement both from local and international media outlets, ethnic Amhara communities have been targets of ethnic-based attacks in the Oromo region, Benishangul Gumuz and Sidama regions of Ethiopia, among others.</p>
      <p>There has been a security challenge within Amhara region of Ethiopia itself, and the region’s security officers have been claiming an active and orchestrated move, without naming the party behind it, to make the region a conflict zone by dividing the Amhara-Qimant communities.  At some point, tens of thousands of people were displaced in the Central Gondar zone of the region.</p>
