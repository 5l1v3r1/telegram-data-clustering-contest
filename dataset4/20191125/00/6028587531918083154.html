      <p><i>“Leadership is teamwork.”</i>Doug Perlman is the CEO of Sports Media Advisors LLC, an advisory firm that serves clients in the sports, television, and digital media world. I sat down with Doug to discuss his career path, the advice he’d give to those who want to enter the sports industry, and how leaders must function in a rapidly changing environment.</p>

      <p><b>Sanyin</b>:<b> </b>Fill in the blank: if we really knew you, we would know that…</p>
      <p><b>Doug</b>: I’m incredibly fortunate to have landed in the career I’m in. I’m doing something I love, and I’m working with great people facing challenging and interesting questions every day.</p>
      <p><b>Sanyin</b>: Tell us about Sports Media Advisors and your role in it.</p>
      <p><b>Doug</b>: I started the firm about ten years ago, and it does advisory and consulting work in the sports media space. First, we advise sports properties: leagues, teams, tournaments, and federations on their media businesses. Sometimes we negotiate television contracts for them with their big network partners, and other times we’re helping them think through their digital strategies, from OTT distribution to social media. Overall, it’s a lot of strategy work and rights negotiations on behalf of properties. We help them figure out how to best distribute as monetizing their content.</p>
      <p>Second, we work with companies that are looking to build sports-related businesses. We leverage our expertise and relationships to help them go to market, get in front of the right folks, speak the right language, and negotiate the right deal terms.</p>
      <p>And finally, we work with investors like private equity firms that are looking to make investments and want to understand the industry. It’s a very idiosyncratic relationship-driven industry, and at the end of the day, everything we do is rooted in our expertise in television and digital media as they relate to sports and our relationships in the industry.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p><b>Sanyin</b>: You’re in a dream job because you get to work with leagues and companies that are entering the sports industry. How did you arrive here? Tell us your backstory.</p>
      <p><b>Doug</b>: As I retell the story it will sound very linear, like it was a clear step-by-step progression. But as with any career, there were a lot of lucky moments that put me on this path. I graduated from Duke and went straight to law school at the University of Virginia. I had a lot of interest in the sports and entertainment industries not just because they were “sexy” and “cool,” but also because in school I studied intellectual property law, trademarks, and copyrights. I found that to be really interesting and engaging, so that was what I wanted to pursue as a lawyer.</p>
      <p>I went to a firm called Proskauer Rose, which is a big global firm that has the top sports practice in the country, where I was able to do quite a bit of sports work. I was there for less than two years when I got an offer to join the National Hockey League (NHL), which had been a client. I went to the NHL to be a lawyer, but in my earliest days there the first digital deals started coming into the league. This was the mid-90s. We didn’t even really have a presence on the internet, and it was all very new. I had a very fortunate break early in my time there. IBM came to the league and offered to get the NHL into the digital business. They said they would put up the capital and the technology. They wanted the NHL to contribute their rights and they were looking to form a joint venture to bring the NHL into the digital age.</p>
      <p>As I started to work on that, I realized that digital was going to change every aspect of the league’s businesses. I really had to think about the implications. Before I knew it, I was talking to the heads of broadcasting, sponsorships, licensing, PR, and hockey operations. I then told my bosses I’d really love to help launch this new business and segue from a legal role into a business one. I joke that if the Commissioner realized how important the business was going to be, he would have never let me anywhere near it. But at the time, it didn’t seem as consequential.</p>
      <p>I became a business person and a media executive, spending about 10 years at the NHL where I ultimately ran the league’s media business- both TV and digital. Then, I went to IMG, where I was President of IMG Media. When I left there, I started Sports Media Advisors. That’s a long-winded answer, but that’s how I came into this role.</p>
      <p>I always felt like I wanted to run my own business, and I thought I was at a point in my career where I had something to offer and knew some things and folks in the industry. I was fortunate in that the nature of my career cycle is such that I got to learn both the digital business and the television business. I felt like that was a nice distinction and it was going to be an increasingly important part of the business and that would be a good basis upon which to start the firm.</p>

      <p><b>Sanyin</b>: A lot of times we tend to only want what already has established status. When IBM came to the NHL, others may not have been interested because it was out-of-the-box and had no established status. There wasn’t any sense of potential importance to the league.</p>
      <p>But you wanted to discover where they could be valuable to the organization. In the process, instead of just working on it by yourself, you reached out to look at the entire ecosystem of the NHL. You were collaborative and thought about what was good for the league. I think that has a big part to do with your career success. Fortune favors the prepared and curious, but I don’t think you were thinking about how this would have helped your career.</p>
      <p><b>Doug</b>: I agree that throughout my career, I’ve really enjoyed working in areas where we needed to start from scratch and figure things out as we went along. In the earliest days with IBM, we were literally making things up from scratch, having to think very creatively and project out many years ahead. At the time, the notion of live video on the internet was almost incomprehensible. We had guidance from IBM with some of the technical elements, but we had to think about all those things and what it might mean for the league. Then we had to think about what role the teams would play, which would always spark discussions about what rights the teams would have versus the league, because nothing in the league’s organic documents addressed those points.</p>
      <p>I’ve always enjoyed that sort of blue-sky thinking and continue to today. A part of our practice, we work with emerging media and technology companies that are looking to enter the sports space, whether it’s virtual reality, augmented reality, point of view camera technologies, etc. I think part of what I love about my job is the variety. Sometimes we’ll go from negotiating significant multi-billion-dollar rights deals to working with young, nimble technology companies. Part of what I love about working with those companies is they have to tackle new challenges and come up with ways to solve problems that have never been solved.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p><b>Sanyin</b>: Part of disruption is that the assumptions we operate under no longer seem to apply, because the operating environment has vastly changed. For someone who is interested in entering the industry or working for you, what advice would you give them?</p>
      <p><b>Doug</b>: We want people that are smart, willing to work hard, who we enjoy being around, and feel comfortable putting in front of clients. For junior hires, we tell them that we can teach them the ins and outs of the sports industry and introduce them to the right folks, but they need to have the right tools in their toolbox in terms of analytical skills. You need to be willing to put in the time to operate and deliver at a high level on any task that we ask of you. At the end of the day, our hiring guidelines are really that simple.</p>
      <p>In terms of getting into the industry, I would encourage everyone to think <i>broadly</i> about what it means to work in the sports industry. A lot of people think about sports agents and general managers, but the industry is so vast that people should open up their minds and think about what interests them: media strategy and price negotiations; media production; sponsorship sales; brand marketing; event production; investment banking; or even architects designing arenas. I also encourage people to read the trades and find out who’s who, who are the key players both as individuals and organizations that they might try to get in front of for experience.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p><b>Sanyin</b>: One of the key takeaways is that the ecosystem is so vast. But people who are interested are often passionate about the content of the sport, which is different that being a contributor to the industry. There is tremendous talent out there who doesn’t even realize they can excel in the industry because they don’t view themselves as consumers of sports. Yet technologies and trends enable them to be phenomenal successes.</p>
      <p><b>Doug</b>: Just because you are an athlete or enjoy watching or reading about sports doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re going to be passionate about a career in sports. When I talk about working in sports, I always call it the “cocktail party” reason: it’s fun and part of the job is we get to go to some neat events and meet cool people. But that doesn’t carry the day and doesn’t carry you through a career.</p>
      <p>Part of why I love what I do is that I get to think about things the evolving media landscape and how people are consuming content, as well as how those will change. I think it’s fascinating and stimulating, and I think for people to have a rewarding <i>and</i> successful career, they need to be engaged by the substance, not simply be a fan. On the flipside, even if you’re not a fan, you might be able to find a rewarding career in the industry as well, such as analytics. There are people who bring incredible perspectives and expertise that might not have grown up a fan but possess a particular skillset. It’s definitely fun to work in the industry, but you have to separate that from the substance of what you’re doing.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p><b>Sanyin</b>: Let’s talk about the substance of the industry. What are the three biggest trends you’re seeing now that are going to affect the future of sports?</p>
      <p><b>Doug</b>: One of the things that we spend a lot of time thinking about is the future of the consumption of sports content. The conversation often starts with the erosion of the cable bundle and what that means for the industry. Cable networks are losing subscribes (and subscription fees) as the number of cable households declines. What does that mean for the future of the consumption of sports media content? What does it mean for the future of rights fees? We think a lot about how it’s all going to change both internally and with our clients.</p>
      <p>With that comes the emergence of over-the-top (OTT) delivery of video content. ESPN+ has gotten the most press in terms of OTT direct to consumer (D2C) sports media offerings, but all the big media companies are entering this space, whether it’s Turner with Bleacher Report Live, NBC with NBC Sports Gold, or CBS. You also have new entrants like DAZN, Facebook and Amazon, all of whom are distributing sports video content in new and different ways. They all have different models, motivations, and metrics.</p>
      <p>The second thing is sports betting. Laws are changing as a lot of states are legalizing sports gambling. This trend is going to transform the way people consumer and produce sports content. We’re already seeing lots of folks creating programming designed for the gambler. You’re also seeing folks not only betting on games before they start, but also betting on events during the course of the game. When people have placed a wager, even if it’s a small one, they tend to watch more events and stay longer when they do. That tends to be good for the parties in the space, whether it’s the properties or the networks. Of course, there’s a lot of work to be done to ensure that the integrity of sports is protected.</p>
      <p>The last area is the emergence of new technologies that will transform the way people produce and consume sports media content. Whether it’s virtual reality, augmented reality, point-of-view camera technologies, or companies getting into the wearables space, they are all going to fundamentally transform the ecosystem. To relate this back to your earlier question about coming into the industry, these are the areas I would seek out if I were a young person looking to enter, because they are ripe for opportunity and growth.</p>

      <p><b>Sanyin</b>: In wild-wild-west situations where there’s a lot of uncertainty, but also many potential upsides to small risks, leadership and teamwork play key roles in tipping the scale to success or failure. How have you seen leadership and teamwork play into the success of your career?</p>
      <p><b>Doug</b>: It’s been absolutely critical. Leadership is teamwork, you’re just functioning as the leader within a team. Being a strong teammate and being able to function in a collaborative way with others has a critical impact on one’s career. That goes beyond one’s immediate team within a company. Back at the NHL, it wasn’t my colleagues within the legal team that led me to fully comprehend the impact that the internet was going to have on the sports industry. It was the conversations with the heads of the departments I mentioned before.</p>
      <p>In even broader terms, getting to know folks throughout your industry will have a massive impact on your ability to function. People use the word “networking” which I don’t love because it sounds Machiavellian or transactional, but it should be how you carry yourself every day. If you’re a college student, you never know what the kid down the hall is going to do. You never know what the other associate in your first-year class at a law firm is going to do. You never know who you’ll meet in your life that will end up having an impact on your career, but they’ll all be a part of your network.</p>

        <b>Takeaways:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>– When looking for ways to innovate, find areas where you can start from scratch and capitalize on the emergence of an entirely new industry. Instead of focusing on problem-solving, look for problems that haven’t been identified yet.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>– If you’re looking to get into the sports industry, be aware of how vast the ecosystem is. The industry is bigger than the content of the sport.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>– Leadership is teamwork. To function in a changing environment, remember that you’re on the same team as those you lead.</b>
