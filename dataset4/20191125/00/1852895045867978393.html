      <h4>Jenna Dewan was glowing on the red carpet at the American Music Awards in LA on November 24. The pregnant actress put her baby bump on display in a tight pink dress — one of her best fashion moments of the year!</h4>
      <p><b><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/jenna-dewan-tatum/">Jenna Dewan</a> </b>stunned on the <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/24/ciara-amas-2019-outfit-photos/">red carpet</a> at the <b>American Music Awards</b> on Sunday night in LA! The pregnant actress, 38, showed off her growing baby bump in a pink floor-length gown that hugged her dancer body. The sleeveless number was bright, sleek and formfitting, which complimented Jenna so well.</p>
      <p>The actress let her brunette hair down on her shoulders. Her locks were styled in loose waves, a go-to hairstyle for Jenna these days. The dancer’s glam was vibrant and coordinated with her bright pink look. — Jenna’s lashes were bold and long. Her deep pink lip was glossy and smooth. And, her cheeks had just the right amount of rosy blush.</p>
      <p>The author walked the red carpet with her friend and stylist <b>Brad Goreski</b> instead of her <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/10/30/jenna-dewan-steve-kazee-dating/">new boyfriend</a>, <b>Steve Kazee</b>, 43 — Jenna’s first relationship after her split from ex-husband, Channing Tatum in April 2018.
