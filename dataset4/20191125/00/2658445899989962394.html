      <p>Labour has promised compensation to more than three million women who lost out on years of state pension payments when their retirement age was raised, if it wins the general election.</p>
      <p>Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the pledge would settle a “debt of honour” to women born in the 1950s.</p>
      <p>Those expecting to retire at 60 were told they would have to wait years longer when changes to the state pension age were accelerated in 2010.</p>
      <p>Labour said its promise may cost £58bn.</p>

      <p>The costing was not included in the party’s manifesto, published earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, cabinet minister Michael Gove said he was “sympathetic” to the position the women were in but accused Labour of producing a manifesto that “drove a coach and horses” through the party’s own rules on spending.</p>
      <p>And Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said it was not clear “where the money is coming from”.</p>
