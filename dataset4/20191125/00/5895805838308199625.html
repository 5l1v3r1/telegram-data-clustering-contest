      <p>We live in a time when, fueled by social media shares, new <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/memes">memes</a> are constantly bubbling up to the surface of our collective cultural consciousness. Memes are juxtapositions or extensions of the familiar. The ones that go viral often reveal an insight about someone or something that was hidden and unnamed, just beneath the surface. They allow the user to vent, to challenge, to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/flirting">flirt</a>, to admire, or to express another <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2001-10055-004?casa_token=znScT7Dix0AAAAAA:0uvDdQAj2vUaAnuyN0lmGIjRoMTreYEtZhfMOv5oZQFH22eeWC0TOL1Ez31GMM3On00EG3BMrGUoAxFESBBB9BI">complex emotion</a>. Viral memes capture a society’s ethos, appearing from just the right source in the right medium at the right time. Users embrace the meme as a membership ticket to the in-crowd, to be counted among the knowing, and to push away from other not-so-desirable, not-so-knowing groups.</p>
      <p>OK Boomer checks all these boxes. The meme was virtually unknown just a few weeks ago. Today, it is all over the internet, with articles about the meme appearing in practically every media outlet. Dictionary.com already has a <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/ok-boomer/">definition up for it</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“OK boomer is a viral internet slang phrase used, often in a humorous or ironic manner, to call out or dismiss out-of-touch or close-minded opinions associated with the baby boomer generation and older people more generally.”</blockquote>
      <p>Such descriptions fail to shine a light on the harm generated in the wake of its growing use. When a young person or a trying-to-be-hip reporter writes or says OK Boomer ironically, or tweets the phrase in response to an article, post, or tweet from an older person, an insidious knowledge structure is created or reinforced in users’ and observers’ minds through <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/089892903321662958?casa_token=IczH36zFfpcAAAAA:w5dzXHKa3BIezZY_hToC5wBUdUX3ZYOtZeA0G59UZ7irxgMz4QhSseCLl1O2pVXohXus0bWosWA">intentional learning</a>.</p>
      <p>With repeated use, it has the potential to affect their attitudes. Interactions with an older person may be viewed through the lens of irony and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger">anger</a>. Three significant psychological downsides of OK Boomer’s popularity are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>It spreads a negative stereotype that stigmatizes older people.</li>
        <li>The phrase is inherently divisive, highlighting differences between the generations.</li>
        <li>Its use and endorsement encourage <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hey-snowflake-dont-ok-boomer-me-at-work-2019-11-19?siteid=yhoof2&amp;yptr=yahoo">age-based marginalization and discrimination</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>By itself, the term "Boomer" or “Baby Boomer” is descriptive. It refers to people <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/baby%20boomer">belonging to a particular generation,</a> those born between 1946 and 1964. It has limited evaluative content. But add OK in front of Boomer, and suddenly, the phrase is highly evaluative and not in a good way.</p>
      <p>Virtually all evaluative content associated with the meme is negative. It characterizes older people as outdated, out-of-touch, self-serving, old, cognitively slow, narrow-minded, clueless, part of the problem, and unconcerned about <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/environment">the environment</a>. In fact, I could not find a single positive association or concept in relation to OK Boomer. What’s more, the meme brands tens of millions of people, basically anyone who looks old (age indeterminate), in this negative light.</p>
      <p>Some users have argued that OK Boomer is meant to apply <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/04/conservative-radio-host-compared-boomer-n-word-even-dictionarycom-was-appalled/">only to the</a> “most privileged members of the boomer generation.” But as social psychologists know all too well, negative stereotypes often begin from narrow, limited roots and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ok-boomer-the-kids-are-fighting-back/2019/11/05/32894688-0011-11ea-9518-1e76abc088b6_story.html?wpisrc=nl_ideas&amp;wpmm=1">spread far beyond the original scope</a> to stigmatize large groups of people, including entire races, ethnic groups, or, in this case, age groups, who have little relation to the initial target.</p>
      <p>Because of its one-dimensional, negative nature, OK Boomer serves as a tool of division, to segregate older people, put them on the spot, and ridicule them. When a younger politician retorts “OK Boomer” to an older colleague, she is going beyond criticism of his immediate behavior and disparaging him in a personal way for <i>who he is</i>. Although it is socially acceptable at the moment, the take-down is not that different from directing a racist or sexist remark at someone.</p>
      <p><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2007-05059-005.html">Social psychologists also know</a> that it is a short jump from the creation and reinforcement of a negative stereotype to behavior that matches it. One of the most robust findings in social psychology is that people’s attitudes towards an object or person <a href="https://content.taylorfrancis.com/books/download?dac=C2009-0-04110-3&amp;isbn=9780203838020&amp;format=googlePreviewPdf">drive their behavior</a>. When OK Boomer is at the top of their minds, younger people will act in ways that are consistent with the negative stereotype.</p>
      <p>It’s only a matter of time before an impatient teenager brushes off a frail person in a supermarket checkout line or a young manager humiliates an older subordinate, retorting “OK Boomer” <i>just because they are old.</i></p>

      <p>The jab makes younger people feel superior, but it's going to have a backlash. People that are over 55 years old that might have agreed with your position aren't likely to back you up. You're going to alienate a group of people that might have been allied with you. OK Boomer isn't just a jab at one person, it's a jab at all Baby Boomers. I have yet to hear it used in conversation. If and when I do hear it, it's likely to color my opinion of the person saying. Next time they come around asking for a favor or advice I'll throw the remark right back at them asking why they want something from a Boomer.</p>

      <p>You make a great point. These clever young people would never consider taking a jab at marginalizing groups. That would be deemed as uncool. They perceive people over 55 years old as being privileged and deserving of their scorn. They hope most Baby Boomers will understand that their insult is not directed at everyone over 55, but that's where they're wrong.</p>
      <p>When bigots make nasty comments about Mexicans they might be only speaking about immigrants. But, all Mexican-Americans feel insulted, even the ones that have lived here for generations. In fact, anyone with Hispanic heritage might be offended when they hear unkind comments about Mexicans.</p>
      <p>The funny thing is that the privileged people that are being targeted with the "OK Boomer" comment are the ones least likely to be phased by it.</p>

      <p>Those in privileged positions (such as myself) won't be bothered by it. My station is relatively secure due to a variety of factors such as a pension and government healthcare. However, there are millions of people in two generations above the age of 55 - the Boomers and those before them - The Silent Generation (born between 1925-1945). Many in the Silent Generation and Boomers are struggling as they face, or begin to face, the rigors of old age. Many are veterans of conflicts that were not popular such as the Korean War. And many served in WWII.</p>
      <p>This may impact the powerless people over the age of 55, of which there are many. Some of those impacted negatively will be the older relatives of the very same people furthering this divide.</p>

      <p>I would suspect a person using any popular meme or term to be a "sheep", without any independent thought. I would think less of them, because they have a need to go along with the crowd.<br/>I don't feel a need to assume that all millennials are are lazy, depressed or stuck to their phones.<br/>These presumptions about groups of people are silly and at worst, hurtful.</p>

      <p>...is that it ignores that Americans of all generations are facing struggles, and that it divides us against ourselves such that we fail to take action as a society to improve the lives of ALL Americans -- and especially since it's not only millennials struggling to afford housing, pay student loans, and launch into life...</p>
      <p>We have seniors who have to choose between paying their electric bills, filling their prescriptions, or buying groceries.</p>
      <p>We have boomers who are retired and didn't want to do so, but lost their jobs or got sick or hurt and could no longer find a suitable job, or any job; or are still working because they can't afford to retire.</p>
      <p>We have Gen X-ers who are trying to take care of their parents, their kids, their jobs, and their communities, and themselves all at the same time, and are one crisis away from everything hitting the fan.</p>
      <p>We have children going to bed hungry right here, right now.</p>
      <p>What we need is for all generations to find their common interests and work together to hold government and business accountable to solving problems all generations have in common.</p>
      <p>However, I don't think this will change, because a lot of people have a vested interest in us being divided amongst ourselves.</p>

      <p>Ha! Well, didn't we boomers have the phrase; "don't trust anyone over thirty"? I think that's coming back to haunt us. I'm laughing at this whole issue because the younger generations (if they're lucky) will be cranky old farts like us, being derided and ridiculed.<br/>That's called "just desserts"!</p>

      <p>The expression "Don't Trust Anyone Over Thirty" might have taken off if we had the Internet back in the 60's. It was limited to militant college students in places like Berkley. It didn't even make any sense back then. Timothy Leary was born in 1920. Abbie Hoffman turned 30 in 1966.</p>

      <p>Submitted by Melody on November 25, 2019 - 5:29pm</p>
      <p>It's too bad that this piece doesn't even attempt to acknowledge what "Ok Boomer" is a response to: the OVERWHELMINGLY PERVASIVE stereotyping of millennials as lazy, entitled, etc., typically by members of older generations, particularly those belonging to the "baby boomer" generation. It's gotten to the point that even the TERM "millennial" is used in a way that fits the author's three main complaints:</p>
      <p>1. It spreads a negative stereotype that stigmatizes [younger] people.<br/>2. The phrase is inherently divisive, highlighting differences between the generations.<br/>3. Its use and endorsement encourage age-based marginalization and discrimination.</p>
      <p>As a millennial with a graduate degree, a career, a mortgage, a successful marriage, a child, and a professional profile on this very website, I am absolutely exhausted by the unrelenting generalization, stereotyping, and stigmatization of millennials. All this article does is add to that ever-growing pile of negative opinion pieces. So forgive "us" (I have never personally used this phrase, but I can sure understand why one would) for getting a little tired and firing back every now and then. For God's sake, cut us some slack.</p>
