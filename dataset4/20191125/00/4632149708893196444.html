      <p><i><b>By </b></i><i><b>Amrita Bose</b></i> <br/><br/><i>At a Bohri Thaal, you’re asked to put your phones away and eat in a group. When was the last time you enjoyed a cuisine like this?<br/></i><br/>It was a common passion for riding that brought together friends and business partners Arpitha Rai and Rehana Nagaria in 2017. Nagaria, who belongs to the city’s Dawoodi Bohra community started riding as a way to express herself and meet people. Rai, who hails from Mangaluru, would often miss home food while living and working in Bengaluru. Nagaria soon started sending home-cooked food to Arpitha. Rai was not only grateful for Nagaria’s generosity but was also blown away by the novelty of the dishes – from White Sauce Chicken Cutlets to vegetarian Dal Chawal Palidu (made from tuvar dal ka pani (water), gram flour, drumsticks and bottle gourd, served with a dal pulao and palidu (gravy). <br/><br/>The unique selling point Rai soon smelt a unique business opportunity. Nagaria, born and brought up in Mumbai, was already an established home cook with recipes gleaned from her family, and perfected in her own kitchen. The idea to start the city’s first Bohri cafe in JP Nagar (a location with a thriving Bohra community) was born out of conversations during a weekend bike ride trip out of town. <br/><br/>“Without any experience, we took the plunge, and rented a 250 square feet of space,” explains Rai. “Rehana’s original plan was to start a Bombay Sandwich place, but a family friend suggested that we keep a section of the menu dedicated to Bohri cuisine. Over time it was decided that only a complete Bohri cuisine menu with meat samosas to Bohri chicken biryani and Raan would do justice to The Bohra Bohra Cafe (now rechristened The Bohra Bohra Thaal). <br/><br/>The cafe then launched with a typical Bohri Mohalla food menu such as Baida Roti, Patti Samosa, Kheema Pav, Dal Ghost, Bohri Biryani, Khichra and more. Though the <br/>cafe space in JP Nagar turned out to be more of a takeaway with Rai sharing a funny anecdote of them having to book a cab to Whitefield once just to transport an entire Raan to a customer: “the raan took up the entire front seat,” she recalls, Nagaria always knew that the true test of her hospitality and cooking acumen would be presenting guests with an authentic Bohra Thaal experience. <br/><br/><b>What’s on the thaal?<br/></b><br/>The Bohri thaal is a larger-than-life plate meant to serve up to eight people – a community dining experience where members of a family sit and eat together. A family that eats together stays together is a dictum followed strictly by Bohra community even today. “We wanted to do the thaal experience because firstly the whole point of it is to bring people together, and secondly no one socialises anymore, because people are busy on their phones. This seemed like the perfect way of bringing like-minded folks together over a grand meal,” noted Nagaria. <br/><br/>On a Sunday afternoon, we landed up at Rai’s house in Koramangala where Nagaria preps and brings over her dishes, which are then served on the thaal arranged on a thick rug on the floor. Get ready to sit on the floor and eat through at least seven courses, alternating between sweet and savoury. We were welcomed with a chilled glass of Gol Pani, with lime, chia seeds and jaggery. Rai then laid down the first rule of the meal and asked us to keep our phones away. After introductions with other guests, we settled down around the thaal and began by washing our hands in a traditional chilamchi lota. We tasted a bit of salt (from the namak dani to activate your palate) and followed it up with sodanu or rice mixed with sugar and ghee. <br/><br/>Sitting around a thaal and eating together also signifies equality and respect, explained Nagaria. A gesture so relevant in today’s estranged times! <br/><br/>The first dish on the plate is always sweet – gooey anjeer halwa (mithas) to be complemented with savoury and spicy masala aloo (kharas). Up next were smoked chicken kheema samosas – the outer whole wheat casing of the samosas are called patti. The Bohra Fried Chicken (marinated in masalas, egg washed and deep fried) came next and was followed up by the Hungama Kebab, chicken mince balls shaped around breadsticks, wrapped up with strips of the samosa casing and deep fried. Then arrived the mighty Raan on Nagaria’s family silverware, marinated overnight, slow cooked on charcoal and served with a smoky, buttery tomato gravy. The meat came off the bone with a mere tug. <br/><br/>Breaking the monotony, we ate a bowlful of Mohalla Caramel Custard, only to prep ourselves for the brothy Nalli Nihari to be mopped up with pillowy sheermal naan (more like a pav than naan). <br/><br/>Nagaria reaches out to ladies in her community for a supply of fresh sheermal naan and pavs, and even hand-churned ice cream. Some of the ingredients such as Bohri masalas, Kaccha Sev (vermicelli), green garlic (in winter), etc are all brought from Mumbai by Nagaria. <br/><br/><br/>The Bohri Chicken Biryani served next , was a delicate, layered dish with long-grain rice, thick masala, dum cooked chicken, fried potatoes and birista or fried onions. The biryani was surprisingly light, and the chicken bits had mixed in with the masalas to create a lovely, thick meaty layer. We finished off with Sancha sitaphal ice cream – the old school, hand-churned ice cream, usually served at Bohra functions and weddings, made with seasonal fruit, milk and sugar. <br/><br/><b>A thaal for any occasion<br/></b><br/>Nagaria and Rai have done several variations of the Thaal including a brunch thaal, a high-tea thaal, and even a LGBTQ one. Bohra Bohra Thaal will soon introduce paya (trotters) dishes in October and a Sunday breakfast thaal with wintertime green garlic, kheema, eggs and ghee called Lasanyo to be eaten with bajre ki roti or pav. <br/><br/>Only a day’s notice is required to deliver any of their dishes to your home. The duo also are happy to send over a Thaal On Wheels, to be set up at your home for a group. And vegetarians fret not, on prior request, the Bohra Bohra Thaal will even fix you up with a vegetarian thaal. But we suggest that you don’t be lazy and order in, and make it for the thaal experience instead – at least once for a true community dining experience.</p>
