      <p>EVERETT — Don’t expect any cancelled classes, but some snow may fall around Snohomish County as temperatures drop Monday and Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The accumulation in the lowlands was expected to be less than 1 inch, if at all, with snow levels hovering around 2,000 feet, the National Weather Service said.</p>
      <p>Anyone heading across the Cascades should be prepared for more, however. The Washington State Department of Transportation recommends slower speeds, more space between vehicles, having <a href="https://www.wsdot.com/winter/tires-chains.htm">traction tires and chains</a>, an ice scraper and a snow brush, and <a href="https://www.wsdot.com/winter/files/winter-driving-checklist.pdf">other items in case the vehicle gets stuck</a> or stranded. People commuting through the mountain passes can check the conditions and any closures at <a href="https://www.wsdot.com/traffic/passes/">www.wsdot.com/traffic/passes</a>.</p>
      <p>Overnight lows were projected to be below freezing for much of Western Washington this week, which could make roads icy.</p>
