      <h1>Over 2,200 People Have Gotten Sick From Vaping in The US This Year</h1>

      <p>(Reuters) - US health officials on Thursday reported 2,290 confirmed and probable cases and 5 more deaths from a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, taking the total death toll to 47 so far this year.</p>
      <p>Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recorded 2,172 cases and 42 deaths from the illness.</p>
      <p>US officials recently said vitamin E acetate - believed to be used as a cutting agent in illicit vaping products containing marijuana components - was found in all lung samples from 29 patients who were tested.</p>
      <p>CDC has called vitamin E acetate a "chemical of concern" and recommended not adding it to e-cigarettes, or vaping products, while the investigation is underway.</p>
      <p>Investigators had earlier pointed to vaping oils containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, as being especially risky.</p>
      <p>The spate of serious respiratory illnesses has led to US officials urging people to stop vaping, especially those products containing THC.</p>
      <p>As of November 20, confirmed deaths were reported in 25 states and the District of Columbia, the CDC said. Louisiana <a href="http://ldh.la.gov/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/5353">became the newest state</a> to report a death from the illness.</p>
      <p>The highest number of deaths were from Illinois, which has so far reported 5 deaths and 187 illnesses.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration announced a plan in September to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from store shelves, as officials warned that sweet flavors had drawn millions of children into nicotine addiction.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump will host a meeting on vaping at the White House on Friday with a range of groups, including industry and public health representatives, a White House spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
