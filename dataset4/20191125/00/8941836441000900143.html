      <p>BEIRUT (AP) - A key road has reopened in the Lebanese capital following clashes throughout the night between rival groups.</p>
      <p>The confrontations began when protesters blocked the street and were attacked by supporters of the two main Shiite political parties, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hizballah/">Hezbollah</a> and Amal. Both sides threw stones at each other for hours as security forces formed a barrier separating them.</p>
      <p>Lebanon’s massive protests against corruption and mismanagement by the country’s political elite are now in their second month, but have so far remained largely peaceful.</p>
      <p>The confrontations on the Ring Road, which broke out late Sunday and dragged into Monday morning, were some of the worst since the nationwide demonstrations began on Oct. 17.</p>
