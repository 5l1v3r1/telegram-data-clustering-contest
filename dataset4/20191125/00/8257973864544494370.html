      <p>Nov. 24 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Sam-Darnold/?tps=1">Sam Darnold</a> threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score to guide the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/New-York-Jets/?tps=1">New York Jets</a> past the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Oakland-Raiders/?tps=1">Oakland Raiders</a> 34-3 on Sunday at MetLife Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Raiders (6-5) entered Sunday's matchup on a three-game winning streak with a possible opportunity to challenge the AFC West-leading <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kansas-City-Chiefs/?tps=1">Kansas City Chiefs</a> for first place next week. Instead, the Jets cruised to a dominant victory for their first three-game unbeaten streak in over two years.</p>
      <p>Oakland jumped ahead with a 48-yard field goal from Daniel Carlson on the team's first drive of the game. Jets kicker Sam Ficken equalized the score at 3-3 with a 24-yard boot with a little over five minutes left in the first quarter.</p>
      <p>From that point forward, the Jets piled on points and managed to contain the Raiders' offensive weapons, outscoring Oakland 31-0 for the remainder of the game.</p>
      <p>Darnold's 4-yard rushing score and Ficken's 35-yard field goal pushed the Jets' lead to 13-3 at halftime. Ryan Griffin and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Robby-Anderson/?tps=1">Robby Anderson</a> each recorded 1-yard touchdown catches in the third, and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Brian_Poole/?tps=1">Brian Poole</a> returned an interception 15 yards for a score to clinch the victory.</p>
      <p>Raiders quarterback <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Derek-Carr/?tps=1">Derek Carr</a> was 15-for-27 with 127 yards and one interception. Oakland head coach <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jon_Gruden/?tps=1">Jon Gruden</a> pulled Carr with under two minutes left in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Josh Jacobs had 10 carries for 34 yards. Backup tailback <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jalen-Richard/?tps=1">Jalen Richard</a> led the team in catches (six) and receiving yards (47), and Darren Waller notched three receptions for 41 yards.</p>
      <p>Darnold completed 20-of-29 throws for 315 yards and two touchdowns. Anderson had a team-high 86 receiving yards on four catches.</p>
      <p>The Jets will play the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Cincinnati-Bengals/?tps=1">Cincinnati Bengals</a> next Sunday. Oakland will stay on the road to take on the Chiefs next week.</p>
