      <p>Having showwed great promise, several clubs are queuing for the signature of the 18-year old, who turned down a move to Arsenal last summer.</p>
      <p>AC Milan's ownersÂ Elliott Management sent scouts to monitor the teenager early this month as they begin a rebuilding of the club with the best young talents across Europe.</p>
      <p>Boadu's exploits has seen AZ enjoy a good start to the campaign as they currently lie in second place in the Dutch eredivisie, six points behind leaders Ajax.</p>
