      <p>Tansley Ladies Group donated £1,580 to Derbyshire, Leicestershire &amp; Rutland Air Ambulance (DLRAA) and £1,580 to The Helen Trust</p>
      <p>Diana Dakin, chairperson of the group 2018/2019, presented Richard Fletcher, Derbyshire volunteer community representative for DLRAA, with the cheque.</p>
      <p>The money was raised over 12 months, launching with a coffee morning and quickly followed with a host of activities which included open evenings, a carol evening, soup bread and cheese lunch, quiz nights, hot cross bun coffee morning. They even had a member of the group complete a sponsored run.</p>
      <p>Some other members did an evening walk with a twist and it was finished in August with a Mega Tombola at the Gate in Tansley.</p>
