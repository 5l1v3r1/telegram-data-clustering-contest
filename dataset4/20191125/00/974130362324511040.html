      <p>Michael Darragh Macauley paid tribute to the late Dermot Manley following Ballyboden St Enda's victory over Garrycastle in Sunday's Leinster club semi-final.</p>
      <p>Manley, who was nicknamed 'Digger', was a clubmate of Macauley. He passed away nearly a fortnight ago.</p>
      <p>"What was on my mind more than anything today was the loss of Dermot Manley," Macauley told RTÃ‰ Radio 1 after the game.</p>
      <p>"Dermot was an unbelievable human who came from this club and played with this team. He was on championship-winning teams with this club. You just don't know, in life and in sport, what's going to happen next.</p>
      <p>"We lost Digger last week and nothing is going to be the same again. We're looking at everything differently.</p>
      <p>"I actually just don't know what to say to his friends and family. He was one of the best humans I ever met and if we had a few more like him, the world would be a better place."</p>

      <p>Sunday's victory sees Ballyboden progress to the Leinster final for the first time since 2015. Macauley said the current panel is the strongest the club has had since that All-Ireland winning 2015/16 campaign.</p>
      <p>"Momentum builds," said Macauley, "people get behind it, flags start going up in Rathfarnham, Knocklyon and people in the shops start talking about it.</p>
      <p>"It gets that lovely buzz about the place."</p>
