      <h1>Russell Westbrook ‘Not Worried One Bit’ About Rockets’ Struggles</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slamonline.com/author/mutoni/" target="_blank">Marcel Mutoni</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/russell-westbrook">Russell Westbrook</a> claims to be “encouraged,” this despite Houston having dropped three in a row.</p>
      <p>Westbrook and co-star <a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/james-harden">James Harden</a> pointed to the Rockets’ poor defensive effort in a 137-123 loss Sunday night to the visiting Dallas Mavericks.</p>

      <p>Per <i><a href="https://apnews.com/8b21fb9c92fe4477be0848a2edfa1221">The AP</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>James Harden was asked what Houston did wrong defensively.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“Everything,” he said. “We allowed them to do whatever they wanted to do from the beginning of the game and when you give a team like that comfort … they gain confidence. And that’s what they did.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>The Mavericks has won five straight, scoring at least 137 in the last three. Houston has lost three straight after winning eight in a row.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“This is a big win. There’s no question about that,” [Rick] Carlisle said. “You come in here, this is a big-time place to play and you’re playing against great players. So our guys deserve credit but this is a process and it’s day by day and week by week and we’ve got to continue to go for daily improvement.”</i>
