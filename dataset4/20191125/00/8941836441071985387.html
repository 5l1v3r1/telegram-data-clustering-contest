      <h1>Australia investigates China plot to plant spy in Parliament</h1>

      <p>PERTH, Australia (AP) - Australian Prime Minister <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-morrison/">Scott Morrison</a> said Monday that allegations of a Chinese plot to plant an agent into <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/australia/">Australia</a>’s Parliament are “deeply disturbing and troubling.”</p>
      <p>The Nine Network on Sunday aired explosive accusations that suspected Chinese operatives had offered Melbourne luxury car dealer Bo “Nick” Zhao 1 million Australian dollars ($679,000) to run as a candidate for a parliamentary seat in Melbourne.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old was found dead in a Melbourne hotel room in March after reportedly approaching ASIO, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/australia/">Australia</a>’s counterespionage agency. Police have been unable to determine how he died.</p>
      <p>“The government has never been more determined to keep Australians free and safe from foreign interference,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-morrison/">Morrison</a> told reporters. “I would caution anyone leaping to any conclusions about these matters.”</p>
      <p>ASIO director-general of security Mike Burgess said late Sunday that the allegations are serious.</p>

      <p>“Hostile foreign intelligence activity continues to pose a real threat to our nation and its security,” he said. “ASIO will continue to confront and counter foreign interference and espionage in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/australia/">Australia</a>.”</p>
      <p>Parliamentary intelligence committee chief Rep. Andrew Hastie called for an investigation into Zhao’s death.</p>
      <p>“This isn’t just cash in a bag, given for favors. This is a state-sponsored attempt to infiltrate our Parliament using an Australian citizen and basically run them as an agent of foreign influence in our democratic system,” he told the Nine Network.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Hastie said he and fellow Liberal Party member Sen. James Paterson had been barred entry to China for a study trip because of their criticism of the Chinese government.</p>

        <p>The latest revelations are set to test already frosty relations between <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/australia/">Australia</a> and China.</p>
        <p>They come days after a self-confessed spy seeking asylum in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/australia/">Australia</a> reportedly gave ASIO inside intelligence on how Beijing conducts its interference operations abroad and revealed the identities of China’s senior military intelligence officers in Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>Wang “William” Liqiang provided detailed accusations of China infiltrating and disrupting democratic systems in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/australia/">Australia</a>, Hong Kong and Taiwan. He would be the first Chinese intelligence operative to blow his cover.</p>
        <p>China attempted to discredit Wang, saying Sunday that he is a convicted fraudster wanted by Shanghai police.</p>
        <p>“He’s in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/australia/">Australia</a>. And we have the rule of law in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/australia/">Australia</a>,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-morrison/">Morrison</a> said of Wang, who is living in Sydney with his wife and infant son on a tourist visa. “And as a result then you can expect the same protections to apply to anyone who is living in our country, whether on a visa or any other arrangement.”</p>
        <p>The Australian government has been trying to neutralize China’s influence by banning foreign political donations and all covert foreign interference in domestic politics.</p>
        <p>Resource-rich <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/australia/">Australia</a> relies on China for one-third of its export earnings.</p>
