      <h1>Gary Neville Claims Manchester United 'Need 5 or 6 Signings' After Difficult Start to Season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15111589" target="_blank">Ed Alexander</a></address>
      <p>​Manchester United must make 'five or six signings' to reinvigorate their squad, according to former Red Devils right-back Gary Neville.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team have been hampered by injuries during the 2019/20 campaign, exposing what Neville believes to be a worrying lack of depth. In the summer, they bought winger Daniel James, central-defender Harry Maguire and full-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka for a combined total of roughly £150m.</p>

      <p>Despite the club's spending, Solskjaer has been forced to call upon several academy products to provide cover. Mason Greenwood and Brandon Williams have each received ample game-time, and both scored in Sunday's 3-3 draw at <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/sheff-utd">​Sheffield United</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Sky Sports after the <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-united">​Red Devils</a> clash with the Blades, Neville stated, as quoted by the <a href="http://manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-transfer-news-neville-17310514">​Manchester Evening News</a>: "The midfield’s just a problem for United full stop. Let’s be clear about it. Even with Scott McTominay in, it it’s a problem. They haven’t strengthened in that area. Obviously, [Paul] Pogba’s injured. It’s a problem for them and it’s just not good enough, the midfield just doesn’t have good enough quality. </p>
      <p>"They need a striker, they need two midfield players, they need a left-back - they need five or six signings. </p>

      <p>"They can’t do that until January and obviously the summer, but the midfield will not go away as a problem for Manchester United just because of an injury. It’s a problem full stop - it needs strengthening."</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are currently ninth in the <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier League</a> table, and the single point picked up at Bramall Lane means they are nine-points behind fourth-place <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/chelsea">​Chelsea</a>.</p>
      <p>However, they have begun to rise out of their slump in recent months, having gone 12 games without scoring more than once in a match. Their change in fortunes can partly be attributed to the form of the youngsters.</p>
      <p>Greenwood has made ten top-flight appearances this year, with fellow teenager Williams and 22-year-old Axel Tuanzebe playing in four games apiece. The former has been heavily involved for for the first-team, scoring five goals in all competitions.</p>
