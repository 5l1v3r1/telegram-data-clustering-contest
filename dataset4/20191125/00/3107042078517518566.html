      <p>The 1884 Sumpter Wharf in Oamaru Harbour, home to the world’s largest colony of Otago shags, has been inspected by Bluff-based Bay Underwater Services NZ, the Waitaki District Council has confirmed.</p>
      <p>Council assets group manager Neil Jorgensen said on Friday the construction crew stabilising piles under Holmes Wharf had also inspected Sumpter Wharf .</p>
      <p>"Nothing at this stage to report," he said in an email. "We are currently focusing on Holmes."</p>
      <p>Sumpter Wharf was closed to traffic in 2004. In 2014, Otago’s only endemic seabird, the Otago shag, began nesting on the 200m-long wharf.</p>
      <p>It has since become home to the largest colony of the species, an estimated 650 nests — a 58% increase from last year and an estimated 40% to 50% of the entire species.</p>
      <p>In July last year, the council approved a $35,000 budget for a dedicated viewing area.</p>
