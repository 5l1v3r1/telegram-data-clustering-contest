      <p>“She is home and doing well,” the court said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg, 86, began experiencing the symptoms on Friday. She went to a hospital in Washington before being transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore for more evaluations, the court said.</p>
      <p>The court said on Saturday that the justice’s symptoms have abated after antibiotics and fluids and that was expected to be released from the hospital the following day.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg is the oldest justice on the court. Her health is closely watched because a Supreme Court vacancy would give President Donald Trump the opportunity to appoint a third justice to the nine-member court and prod it further to the right.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg has faced several health scares over the past year, including in August, when she underwent radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer.</p>
