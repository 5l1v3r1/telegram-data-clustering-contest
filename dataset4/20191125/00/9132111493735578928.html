      <p>The Adjabeng Migistrate court in Accra has struck out an assault case against the Member of Parliament for the Odododiodio Constituency, Edwin Nii Lante Vandderpuye.</p>
      <p>The alleged case of assault was filed against the NDC MP by his 2016 opponent of the New Patriotic Party, Nii Lante Bannerman who accused him of punching him during the 2016 campaign season.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Ghanaweb.com after the hearing, Mr Nii Lante Bannerman said the case was struck out only as a result of procedural issues including miscommunication between the prosecution and the court.</p>
      <p>“The prosecutor called me some few days to the date, that was October 14, that they are due to attend a course at Aburi, so she wouldn’t be able to make it to court on that day and because of that the case wouldn’t be heard. I think she sent a message to the investigator to come and notify the court that they will not be present, the investigator also delayed in doing that. That is why there were procedural issues and because of that, the case has been struck out now, but then we’ve been asked to present a fresh case for another time.”</p>
      <p>He indicated that the prosecution was going to file a new case which is expected to be presented to the court on December 2, 2019.</p>
      <p>In November 2016, Nii Lante Bannerman accused Nii Lante Vanderpuye of punching him in the face twice. The opponents who held rallies in the Odododiodio Constituency on the same day in the lead up to the 2016 parliamentary elections, had their supporters clashing on the day.</p>
      <p>According to Nii Lante Bannerman, he was accosted by his opponent the next day at James Town where he was assaulted by the then Sports Minister.</p>
