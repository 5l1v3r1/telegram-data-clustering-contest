        <b>AFTER walking away with top honours at the 2019 Press Association of Jamaica (PAJ) National Journalism Awards, held at the Courtleigh Auditorium on Saturday evening, the Jamaica Observer's Racquel Porter beamed with pride on being named Journalist of the Year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>For Porter, the recognition from her peers for her work, especially in covering matters relating to children's rights and the gripping realities of Jamaican life, was but secondary to the primary prize for a reporter, that of being able to tell the stories of the human condition and impacting lives.</p>
      <p>“It was a wonderful feeling and I am grateful for the recognition, but I think that, for me, there is no amount of awards that can make me feel the way I felt when Raheem Powell received his birth certificate earlier this year. And not just him, but other stories I have written that have made a change, or had an impact,” said Porter in reference to her 'No birth certificate' story which garnered much public interest earlier this year.</p>
      <p>“That feeling when he got his birth certificate was like winning the award from even then,” she explained.</p>
      <p>Porter was selected for the award based on her entries: 'No birth certificate'; 'Baby snatcher'; 'ATM Mom'; 'After brain surgery, 11-year-old girl learns to walk again, aces PEP'; and 'Windscreen wiper does it for his children'.</p>
      <p>The judges, in their report, noted that Porter, as a journalist, “used the power of her pen” to write stories that had public appeal and created a change in the lives of her fellow Jamaicans.</p>
      <p>She also copped the United Nations Children's Fund award for excellence in reporting on children's rights.</p>
      <p>“Those stories are stories that really warm my heart. So, as I said, the award was just icing on the cake, because the fact that their lives were changed somehow, after I did the story, is a great feeling,” Porter told the <b>Observer</b>.</p>
      <p>“It's a wonderful feeling, and I am proud to be among the nominees. And even if I didn't win, I am grateful that I was shortlisted. Even if I wasn't shortlisted, the fact that...I am doing what I love, I am living my purpose and that is enough,” she added.</p>
      <p>The Queen's School past student shared that she started out as a library assistant at the <b>Jamaica Observer</b> in 2009. Her ingress in journalism saw her initially spotlighting up-and-coming artistes when entertainment editor at the <b>Observer</b>, Brian Bonitto, learnt of her interest and encouraged her to work on honing her craft.</p>
      <p>“I started writing entertainment, featuring new artistes. Later, the Vybz Kartel trial was going on and I was fascinated with the whole thing. I started going to court on my days off from work. After that I started doing court stories for online,” shared Porter on her beginnings in the profession.</p>
      <p>She also expressed gratitude for her team members.</p>
      <p>“Of course, I have to big up all the editors, all my colleagues, friends, and supporters. It's not just my award, it is fi wi award; it's teamwork — the drivers and photographers, everybody. The stories [entered] were roving stories, and you know how much I love roving and getting original stories. So it's teamwork... I couldn't go roving on my own.”</p>
      <p>A single mother of a teenage son, Porter shared a humbling moment she had as she celebrated her award with him.</p>
      <p>“When I first found out that I had been shortlisted, I wanted to win the Theodore Sealy Award for news again, because I won it last year. When I saw the list; yes, I saw that my name was in the first category for journalist of the year, but when I didn't see my name for news I was disappointed,” said Porter.</p>
      <p>“My son said to me, 'Mommy, easy yuhself,' those were his words. He said, 'Look at the bigger picture.' Mi just haffi shut mi mout' and say, 'Wow, this 13-year-old boy have mi under manners',” she said, and followed up with a laugh.</p>
      <p>“But he has said that he is very proud of me, and I know my father and the rest of my family are proud as well,”she added.</p>
      <p>PAJ President George Davis shared his delight at Porter's success: “I am exceedingly happy for Racquel Porter. I have spoken to people who know her, and they say her attitude is just so remarkable. To see her achieve so much in so short a time frame is indeed remarkable,” he said.</p>
