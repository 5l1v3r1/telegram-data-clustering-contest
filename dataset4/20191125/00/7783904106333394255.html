      <p>Council of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research (CSIR) participated in Agrovision 2019 organized at Nagpur on 22-25 November, 2019. Various CSIR Institutes engaged in developing agro products and farming equipment displayed their products for the benefits of farmers and guided them on increasing their productivity with the minimum cost of production.</p>
      <p>The farmers of Vidarbha were encouraged to cultivate various varieties of lemongrass and palmarosa developed by CSIR-CIMAP to get more benefit. CSIR-CIMAP, Lucknow has already deployed improved varieties of lemon grass and palmarosa in 600 acres of land in Vidarbha. Various herbal products including skin care, hair care, mosquito repellant, neutraceuticals, disinfectants, etc. were also showcased by CSIR-CIMAP.</p>
      <p>CSIR-CMERI, Durgapur showcased its new inventions for modern agriculture including solar-based automatic irrigation and cotton picking head. Automated irrigation with solar tree was demonstrated to the farmers as an ideal solution to load shading. The picking of cotton balls is still done manually, especially by women and children. Therefore, CSIR-CMERI demonstrated that the spindle type, tractor operated picking head can be used to mechanize cotton harvesting and thereby reduce the overall production cost. In order to promote mechanized agriculture among farmers with small land holdings, a small-range 11.2 horsepower diesel engine tractor costing Rs. 2 lakh was also displayed by CSIR-CMERI.</p>

      <p>CSIR-IHBT demonstrated a potential of Stevia cultivation in Vidarbha, which is known as sweet herb of Paraguay and 300 times sweeter than sucrose. On an average, dry leaf yield of stevia is 3.0-3.5 tonnes/ha/year, which fetches market price of Rs.100 to 120/ kg, resulting in net return of Rs.2.0-2.7 lakh/ha/year. Edible and ornamental bamboos were also displayed by CSIR-IHBT.</p>
      <p>CSIR-NBRI exhibited the biofertilizers, bioplastics and herbal products including gulal, dye, soft drinks, chocolates, jam, etc. CSIR-CFTRI apprised the farmers about bakery, beverage, cereal, fruit and vegetable products.
