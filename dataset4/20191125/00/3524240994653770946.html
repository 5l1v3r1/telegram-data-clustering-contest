      <p>The organised labour has called on the Kwara State Governor, Abdulraham Abdulrasaq, to implement the N30,000 new minimum wage for workers in the state.</p>
      <p>The labour leaders made the call on Friday at a press conference jointly organised by the Nigeria Labour Congress, Trade Union Congress and the Joint Negotiating Council at the Labour House in Ilorin.</p>
      <p>Ore said that after the meeting of the Kwara State Public Service Joint Negotiating Council, the congress forwarded a circular and template of negotiation of consequential adjustment of salaries arising from the new national minimum wage of N30,000 per month to Abdulrazaq for consideration.</p>
      <p>He said, “We are hopeful and believe that Governor Abdulraham Abdulrasaq will yield to our demand and commence the immediate payment of the N30,000 minimum wage to our workers in the state.”</p>
