      <p>Of Kwabena Boadu Dr Bawumia wrote on Instagram “So soon, it has been three years already… I came to love him as a younger brother and he came to understand me like no other person I have ever worked with. His loss still remains a big blow to me, his family and all who knew him.”</p>
      <p>“His departure is still difficult to accept,” he added.</p>
      <p>Kwabena Boadu was found dead in his hotel room three years ago in the Upper West Regional capital, Wa.</p>
