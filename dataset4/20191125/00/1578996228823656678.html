      <p>Eilish is nominated for six awards tonight, including New Artist of the Year, Favorite Music Video (for "Bad Guy"), Favorite Social Artist, Favorite Female Artist - Pop/Rock, Favorite Album - Pop/Rock (<i>When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</i>), and Favorite Artist - Alternative Rock.</p>
      <p>Eilish will also be performing during the ceremony.</p>
      <p>Eilish is one of ELLE's Women in Music and <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/a28872999/billie-eilish-interview-october-2019-elle-cover/">spoke to the magazine</a> this fall about how her mental health is much better now than it has been before. "I’m finally not miserable," she said.</p>
      <p>"Two years ago, I felt like nothing mattered; every single thing was pointless," she continued. "Not just in my life, but everything in the whole world. I was fully clinically depressed. It’s insane to look back and not be anymore." She said people commenting that she was faking depression had an effect on her. “It hurt me to see that. I was a 16-year-old girl who was really unstable. I’m in the happiest place of my life, and I didn’t think that I would even make it to this age.”</p>
      <p>“I haven’t been happy for years," she said. "I didn’t think I would be happy again. And here I am—I’ve gotten to a point where I’m finally okay. It’s not because I’m famous. It’s not because I have a little more money. It’s so many different things: growing up, people coming into your life, certain people leaving your life. All I can say now is, for anybody who isn’t doing well, it will get better. Have hope. I did this shit with fame riding on my shoulders. And I love fame! Being famous is great, but it was horrible for a year. Now I love what I do, and I’m me again. The good me. And I love the eyes on me.”</p>
