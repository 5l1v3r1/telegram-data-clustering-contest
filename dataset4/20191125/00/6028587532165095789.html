      <p>Bray Wyatt’s lackluster feud with Seth Rollins nearly ruined “The Fiend,” but at WWE Survivor Series, Daniel Bryan saved the day.In front of a packed crowd in the Allstate Arena in Chicago, Wyatt soundly defeated Bryan with the Mandible Claw in what was the best booking decision WWE’s creative team has made for Wyatt so far. Of course, Wyatt’s latest push at the top of the card got off to an awfully rocky start at Hell in a Cell last month when Wyatt failed to defeat Rollins for the Universal Championship in one of the <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/10/fans-chant-aew-and-refunds-over-the-wwe-hell-in-a-cell-main-660461/">most criticized WWE main events in recent memory</a>. WWE took advantage of its mulligan at Crown Jewel when Wyatt defeated Rollins to become Universal Champion, but the match itself was nothing special and was hampered by the distracting red lights that WWE–for some reason or another–insists on using during The Fiend’s matches.</p>
      <p>And if the third time is indeed the charm, WWE finally got it right with Wyatt at Survivor Series.</p>
      <p>After it initially looked like Bryan was headed for an Intercontinental Championship rivalry with Shinsuke Nakamura while <a href="https://wrestlingnews.co/wwe-news/news-on-bray-wyatts-next-feud/">Wyatt was slated to feud with The Miz</a>, WWE changed course and inserted the always popular Bryan into a feud with Wyatt’s sinister alter-ego. After spending nearly a year as one of WWE’s best heels, Bryan is in the early stages of another babyface run that fans have welcomed with open arms. With a long history of being a <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1991258-wwe-news-daniel-bryans-merchandise-sales-confirm-hes-an-a-player">stellar merchandise mover</a> and <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/4851811/daniel-bryan-wwe-return-causes-spike-in-wrestlemania-34-ticket-sales/">even a ticket-selling draw</a> as a fan favorite, WWE made the smart move by putting the universally liked Bryan into a feud with Wyatt, who has been generating babyface-like reactions due to his incredible performances as The Fiend.</p>
      <p>WWE’s <a href="https://wrestletalk.com/news/report-wwes-long-term-plans-for-the-fiend-revealed/">long-term goal with Wyatt</a> is to transform him into one of the company’s top babyfaces, and given the <a href="https://wrestletalk.com/news/report-wwes-long-term-plans-for-the-fiend-revealed/">strong crowd reaction he generates</a> as well as his <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/08/wwe-announces-quick-sellout-for-bray-wyatt-playset-boxes-658405/">impressive merchandise sales</a>, it will be virtually impossible for WWE to keep him in his current villainous role for the long haul. But in looking at the current construction of the SmackDown roster, it’s clear that Wyatt is needed much more on the heel side as the blue brand’s dominant and villainous champion. SmackDown, after all, already boasts a stellar trio of top babyfaces to build around in Bryan, Roman Reigns and Braun Strowman while the likes of Kofi Kingston, Ali, The Miz and Shorty G provide the brand with some much needed depth on the babyface side as well.</p>
      <p>When it comes to heels, though? SmackDown falls a bit short.</p>
      <p>With Brock Lesnar’s <a href="https://www.ringsidenews.com/2019/11/06/why-wwe-moved-brock-lesnar-back-to-raw/">surprising move back to Raw</a>, WWE is really left only with Shinsuke Nakamura (with Sami Zayn) and Baron Corbin as top villains on SmackDown, and that duo has been plagued by plenty of poor booking over the course of the past year. When you look at the clear lack of formidable heels on SmackDown, it becomes obvious that Wyatt–despite continuing to generating babyface-like crowd reactions from the crowd–is in a league of his own on SmackDown’s heel side. Of course, it’s no secret that a show’s top babyface is only as good as its top heel, and it’s going to be difficult for SmackDown to sustain any type of consistent viewership if it doesn’t build up new heels on the blue brand.</p>
      <p>For now, SmackDown’s blatant heel shortage makes Wyatt that much more important to the success of the show, which is why pairing him in a feud with Bryan was such a brilliant idea. Bryan is bulletproof in the sense that fans know he’s a fantastic wrestler with credibility as a former multi-time world champion and the likability that very few stars possess, and so if any star could be metaphorically fed to Wyatt at Survivor Series, it was Bryan. In actuality, though, Bryan looked like the lovable underdog he’s been throughout much of his career at Survivor Series, where he lost–but had the crowd in the palm of his hand–but won’t be damaged by the defeat as much as many others would.</p>
      <p>WWE <a href="https://wrestletalk.com/news/report-wwe-planning-seth-rollins-fiend-double-turn/">resisted the temptation of a Wyatt babyface turn</a> at Crown Jewel out of necessity, and now, the company is working hard to erase the prior bad booking of Wyatt by booking him strongly moving forward. The creative team got off to a tremendous start at Survivor Series, where Wyatt picked up a much needed and convincing victory that helps further cement him as a heel while also building him up as a more credible champion following his terrible feud with Rollins.</p>
      <p>That sounds like a win-win for WWE at a time when its creative team sure seems to lose quite often.</p>
