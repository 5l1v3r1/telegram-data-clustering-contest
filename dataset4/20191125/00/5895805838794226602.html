      <p>Your coworker's cell phone starts to ring. You watch the blood drain from her face as she answers, her expression registering a mix of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">anxiety</a> and dread. She speaks softly and says very little, and although you cannot hear the voice on the other end over the workplace din, her demeanor tells you all you need to know about the tenor of the interaction. Afterwards, she is quiet and uncommunicative. You know from past experience if you ask her what is wrong she will say “nothing.” So as a practical matter, what can you do?</p>

        <b>Identifying <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/domestic-violence">Domestic Violence</a> Victims</b>
      </p>
      <p>Most of us have witnessed some version of this dilemma, leaving us with no tangible proof of anything, but a terrible feeling about what is going on behind the scenes.</p>
      <p>Domestic violence is an insidious but largely invisible epidemic that transcends economic and social classifications, as well as demographics and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gender">gender</a>. After 23 years as a prosecutor I can attest to the reality that both men and women can be domestic abusers as well as victims. Yet due to the personal issues involved, as well as social stigma, domestic violence continues to fly under the radar.</p>
      <p>Many abusers inflict both physical harm and psychological <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/trauma">trauma</a>. Psychological abusers seek to control their victims with domination, intimidation, and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/embarrassment">humiliation</a>. They destroy their victim´s sense of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/self-esteem">self worth</a>, credibility, and sense of importance. They accomplish this through live tactics as well as through technology, as I discuss in a prior column, "<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/why-bad-looks-good/201807/remote-controlled-domestic-abuse-through-technology">Remote Controlled: Domestic Abuse Through Technology</a>."[i]</p>
      <p>Not only do victims fail to report their victimization, they do not give friends or coworkers much to work with in terms of physical evidence. Most victims do not arrive at work with black eyes and bruises. Nor are they conspicuously covered from head to toe in the middle of summer, presumably to hide bruising or other evidence of abuse. Even in the rare case of a visible injury paired with an implausible explanation, a suspicious coworker still struggles with the decision about what to report and to whom.</p>
      <p>In addition, many crimes related to interpersonal abuse, such as criminal threats, stalking, and false imprisonment just to name a few, do not require physical injury. And there are emotional red flags potentially signaling domestic abuse, physical or nonphysical, that have been recognized practically, as well as empirically. You may be able to detect them if you know what to look for, and where to look.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Emotional Regulation and Domestic Violence Victims</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nicole H. Weiss et al. (2018) studied emotional regulation (ER) among 210 female domestic violence victims.[ii] Their results distinguished three classes of women who were victimized, separated by different levels of difficulty regulating positive and negative emotion.</p>
      <p>The women completed measures assessing <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/emotion-regulation">emotion regulation</a>, posttraumatic <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stress</a> disorder, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression">depression</a>, and misuse of drugs or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/alcohol">alcohol</a>. The researchers used further analysis to identify victim subgroups with similar levels of difficulty regulating emotion, both positive and negative.</p>
      <p>Across these classes, they examined differences in <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/psychiatry">psychiatric</a> difficulties such as symptoms of depression and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder">PTSD</a>, as well as risky behaviors such as abusing drugs and alcohol. They note that their findings extend theory on emotional regulation difficulties “by suggesting that higher levels of difficulties regulating positive emotions may occur only among individuals who exhibit high levels of difficulties regulating negative emotions.”</p>
      <p>They found that women who had more difficulty regulating emotion, regardless of emotion valence, had greater psychiatric difficulties. They also found that women who had more difficulty regulating both positive and negative emotion engaged in more risky behaviors—alcohol and drug misuse was the behavior measured in the study.</p>
      <p>From a therapeutic perspective, Weiss et al. note that their findings suggest the value of person-centered approaches in order to identify patterns of difficulties in terms of emotional regulation, and risk for psychiatric challenges and potentially dangerous behaviors.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Seeing is Believing</b>
      </p>
      <p>So if ER can reveal potential evidence that might indicate victimization, particularly in connection with other factors, how can we be better witnesses? Because isolation is another indicator of toxic relationships, we might miss signs and symptoms of abuse due to lack of exposure. Victims might call in sick to work, friends may cancel lunch plans the night before—with a dubious explanation.</p>
      <p>Appreciating the sensitive nature of broaching the subject of interpersonal violence, seeking opportunities to interact with friends and loved ones in person, talking instead of just texting, will increase the chances of detecting signs of both physical and psychological abuse, and the opportunity to offer support.</p>

      <p>Dr. Patrick,<br/>In this article, you cite a study which only studied female victims of domestic violence.</p>
      <p>Just so you know, there is 13-page PDF file on newmalesrtudies dot com, titled "Male Victims of Domestic Violence", by Donald Dutton and Katherine White.</p>
      <p>To state the obvious, there are far fewer services available for male victims of domestic violence.</p>
      <p>In the USA, there is only the Violence Against Women Act. During VAWA public hearings, men's organizations attempted to present the evidence that women battered men as often as the converse, but were prevented from doing so. As a result, the bill that violates the Equal Protection rights of men became law.</p>
      <p>Recent research has found that in cases of non-reciprocal domestic violence, women are the perpetrators 70% of the time.</p>
