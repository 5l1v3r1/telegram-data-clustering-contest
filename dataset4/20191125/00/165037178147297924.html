        <b>Harry Kane hopes 'proven winner' Jose Mourinho can deliver the trophies that Tottenham crave after taking over as manager from Mauricio Pochettino.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Portuguese, <b>back in the game after 11 months out</b>, led his new club to a 3-2 win at West Ham on Saturday --<b> their first Premier League away win since January.</b></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/h-kane-120815/">Kane</a> was a staunch supporter of Pochettino, crediting him with <b>making him into one of the top strikers in the world</b>, and visited the Argentine at his home after his dismissal.</p>
      <p>"It's a week I've never really had in my career before," said the England captain. "<b>It was a big shock on Tuesday night for everyone</b>, the players included, and then it was a quick turnaround. All of a sudden we've got a new manager, <b>one of the best managers there's been in the game</b>, so automatically you have to turn your head towards that and focus on the game."</p>

      <p>Pochettino, <b>who took Spurs to the Champions League final in June</b>, ended his five-and-a-half year stint with no silverware. Kane has expressed his desire to win trophies at <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Spurs</a> and is hoping that Mourinho, <b>a former boss of Chelsea and Manchester United</b>, can help him achieve his goals.</p>
      <p>"The gaffer's won at every club he's gone to -- there's no hiding away from that," Kane said. "<b>He wants to win</b>. He's a proven winner. I've made it clear that I'm at the stage of my career where I want to win trophies. <b>I've made it clear I want to win them here </b>and it's a big year for us."</p>
      <p>Kane said Mourinho's reputation for winning silverware gave the players confidence. "<b>It's almost a fresh slate for everyone now</b> to show the manager what they can do and<b> hopefully the players can thrive on that</b>," he said.</p>
      <p>Midfielder <b>Eric Dier said the players were lucky</b> to be able to work under Mourinho, whom he called the "perfect" replacement for Pochettino. "H<b>is record is unbelievable and he transmits that confidence</b>. The way he speaks, you believe it, you feel it from him," Dier said.</p>
