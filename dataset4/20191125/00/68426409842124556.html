      <h1>Better than the old days, but double the price: OCS launches same-day delivery pilot in Toronto</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Jameson Berkow</a></address>
      <p>It was an experience I have had many times before, since long before cannabis was officially legalized in Canada.</p>
      <p>Tap my phone a dozen or so times, then sit back and wait for some weed to arrive at my home later that day. As a Toronto resident, however, Monday marked the first time I was able to experience that process legally via the newly launched Ontario Cannabis Store (OCS) same-day/next-day delivery pilot.</p>
      <p>Pineapple Express Delivery, <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/robcannabispro/article-day-7-we-pride-ourselves-on-discreteness-inside-a-private/">a private company that already offers similar services</a> in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, will handle the expedited shipping, OCS spokesperson Daffyd Roderick confirmed, with Canada Post continuing to deliver standard orders. The provincially-owned OCS has been <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/robcannabispro/article-ontario-abandons-plan-for-same-day-cannabis-delivery/">working on ways of offering faster shipping options since early 2019</a>, and the pilot program will initially be available only to OCS customers with 'M' at the beginning of their postal code (insert a ‘marijuana’ joke there if you want, but that feels pretty lazy).</p>
      <p>The program will eventually be expanded to the rest of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Mr. Roderick said, though no timeline has been established.</p>
      <p>With live tracking not unlike most modern food delivery apps and a guaranteed delivery window (6:30-10pm ET) and promises of regular updates via text, the experience was definitely better than the old days; prohibition-era stories of dealers texting they were ’20mins away’ only to show up four hours later - or sometimes not at all - are all-too-common.</p>
      <p>Yet for $12.17 +HST ($13.75 total), I had to pay more than double what it costs for standard Canada Post delivery ($5.65), which takes one to three business days. Also, worth noting this is the sort of service that has long been available, albeit illegally, entirely for free.</p>
      <p>Granted, same-day or next-day delivery is surely worth more than nothing in the legal cannabis market. But $13.75 - or $12 for next-day - seems a steep price to pay for punctuality.</p>
