      <p>“Look at the sky and Keep your dreams alive. Hard work, determination and dedication are essential to achieve your goals and the most important part lies in having faith and believing in yourself. Remember all things are possible for those who believe, said CA Prafulla Chhajed, President of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India while speaking as a Chief Guest in an Interactive meet held at ICAI Bhawan for CA students by Nagpur Branch of WICASA of ICAI. The aim of this seminar was to have a direct interaction of CA Students with Hon’ble President of ICAI. The objective was to motivate CA Students in the field of their performance, work and training.</p>
      <p>While addressing the future members of ICAI, Shri Chhajed emphasized on the importance of conceptual clarity, sound practice and thorough revision as the key pointers that will always lead the students to success. He gave his example &amp; talked about the difficulties &amp; approach of his journey from student to becoming a member.</p>
      <p>During his discussion relating to the curriculum and examination, he asked for attention of the students towards the basic requirements of learning which many students lack today. He explained that a student must enhance his understanding and significance of not just the topics of the curriculum, but its inter-linkages with other topics and capture broad overview. He remarked that this will help the students to understand questions better and answer them with precision.</p>
      <p>He quoted that “Men often become what they believe themselves to be. If I believe I cannot do something, it makes me incapable of doing it. But when I believe I can, then I acquire the ability to do it even if I didn’t have it in the beginning,” Shri Prafulla Chhajed urged the students to take failure as a challenge and learning experience of their career. He updated students with all the future initiatives to be taken by ICAI for providing better facilities and atmosphere to scale up the horizon of learning of students fraternity at large.</p>
      <p>While addressing the disciplined students, he also said that his mantra for life has always been that “It is one Life and it’s your Life and it is you who needs to take decision on what is good or bad, right or wrong”. In his opinion, it is a myth that CA students are required to be only book worms but instead he asked students to pursue their passion along with studies and live their life to the fullest.</p>
      <p>Students were encouraged &amp; motivated with his words to plan out there study schedule and work accordingly.
