      <p>Trying to take holiday photos worth remembering? Or maybe just up your Instagram game? You could always invest in a DSLR, but man those things are expensive. Not to mention they have a steep learning curve. Do your bank account and your sanity a favor and snag the <a href="https://store.nypost.com/sales/revolcam-the-multi-lens-photo-revolution-for-smartphones?utm_source=nypost.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=revolcam-the-multi-lens-photo-revolution-for-smartphones&amp;utm_term=scsf-352572&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004MyMR&amp;scsonar=1">RevolCam: Multi-Lens Photo Revolution for Smartphones</a> instead.</p>
      <p>Originally funded on Kickstarter, the RevolCam is like smartphone photography magic. Sure, your iPhone probably packs an awesome camera already, but it’s no DSLR. This multi-lens kit can basically transform it into one.</p>
      <p>Its triangular configuration of three lenses – fisheye, wide-angle, and macro – lets you switch up your photo styles with a simple flick. Just rotate it into place and voila! Photos you’ll actually want to frame. Plus, you can pop on the adjustable LED light for even better, brighter snapshots, or take stellar selfies using the built-in mirror as a guide. The genius of it all is you don’t have to tote around a bunch of separate pieces. With all five features integrated into one accessory, the RevolCam practically defines compact convenience.</p>
      <p>Oh, and before you ask, the answer is yes. The RevolCam is compatible with pretty much all phones – the brand new iPhone 11, the Samsung Galaxy S10, or even the half-decade old iPhone 6.</p>
      <p>This revolutionary device usually costs $59, but is on sale now for $39.99. Plus, when you enter the code <b>BFSAVE15</b> at checkout, you can slash an additional 15% off the sale price, <a href="https://store.nypost.com/sales/revolcam-the-multi-lens-photo-revolution-for-smartphones?utm_source=nypost.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=revolcam-the-multi-lens-photo-revolution-for-smartphones&amp;utm_term=scsf-352572&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004MyMR&amp;scsonar=1">knocking it down to just $33.99</a>.</p>
