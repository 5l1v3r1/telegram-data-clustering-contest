      <h1>The Walking Dead Showrunner is Open to Andrew Lincoln’s Return</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:16:45+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:16</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>The tenth season of <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-walking-dead"><b>The Walking Dead</b></a> has just hit the mid-season finale. But showrunner Angela Kang is still keeping the door open for the show’s first survivor to come home. In a lengthy interview with <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/walking-dead-finale-michonne-exit-lauren-cohen-return-angela-kang-cliffhanger-new-spinoff-amc-1202794190/">Deadline</a>, Kang addressed the potential return of Andrew Lincoln’s Rick Grimes. </p>
      <p>“Not this season, but man, I would love it if he did,” explained Kang. “You know we were talking about having (Lincoln) direct something for a while, but then he wanted to focus on some acting stuff, and he didn’t want to drop out on us at the last minute if something came along, and you know he’s been doing a movie lately.”</p>
      <p>“The door is always open,” added Kang. “Andy, you can come back any time.”</p>

      <p>Rick’s last appearance was in season nine, after he narrowly survived a harrowing experience. Anne and her allies spirited Rick away to recover from his injuries. When the show returned with a time jump, Rick had been gone for several years.</p>
      <p>At San Diego Comic-Con, <a href="https://www.amc.com/shows/the-walking-dead/talk/2019/07/the-walking-dead-movie-rick-grimes-teaser-comic-con">AMC confirmed</a> that Lincoln will reprise his role as Rick for an upcoming movie. At the time, AMC’s David Madden explained the reason for the spinoff.</p>
      <p>“For many years, fans have talked about things in the apocalypse they want to see and now we have an opportunity to explore those stories, beginning with the character who started it all, Rick Grimes.”</p>
      <p>There’s no timetable on <b>The Walking Dead</b> film just yet. So it’s unclear when that project will begin.</p>
      <p>Season 10 of <b>The Walking Dead</b> will resume on February 23, 2020.</p>
