      <p>The app can be downloaded from the iTunes store or Google Play.</p>

        <figcaption>Click on the vote icon on the bottom of the screen to cast your vote (Picture: Metro grab)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>You must register before you can start casting votes and you’ll need a valid iTunes account to register.</p>
      <p>Fans will have to wait until Ant and Dec announce the vote is open during the live show – once it’s open, fans will only have a few minutes to open the app and cast up to five votes.</p>
      <p>If you can’t download the app – or don’t want to – you can still vote in the Bushtucker Trials.</p>

      <p>When the show is on, call or text the numbers advertised on the screen or which Ant and Dec will read out regularly.</p>
      <p>Make sure you’re not watching a repeat or a +1 episode as your vote won’t count but you could still be charged.</p>
