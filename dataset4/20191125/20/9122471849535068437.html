      <h1>Injury Update For Oakland Raiders WR Hunter Renfrow</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:32:22+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Not only did the Oakland Raiders get blown out by the New York Jets on Sunday, but they also lost promising rookie wide receiver Hunter Renfrow to an injury.</p>
      <p>Renfrow took a big hit from Jets rookie cornerback Blessuan Austin in the second quarter of yesterday’s loss. He was clearly in pain on the ground after the play.</p>
      <p>While the hit from Austin was clean and legal, many thought it might have constituted pass interference. Either way, he laid a lick on Renfrow.</p>

      <p>Now, thanks to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport, we have an updated on Renfrow’s condition. The former Clemson star broke a rib and punctured his lung on the play.</p>
      <p>Scary stuff, and right now it’s unclear how long he will be out.</p>

      <p>A fifth-round pick for the Raiders in April, Renfrow has 36 receptions for 396 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
      <p>Oakland is 6-5 after losing to the Jets, but remains in the AFC playoff hunt.</p>
