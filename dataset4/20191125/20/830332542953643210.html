      <p>WAUSAU, Wis. - Wisconsin is ending the year with more fatal police shootings than last year.</p>
      <p>Data collected by the Wisconsin Professional Police Association shows police shot and killed 16 people this year. There were 13 fatal police shootings in 2018.</p>
      <p>Wisconsin Public Radio reported Monday that 11 of those killed this year were white, three were black and two were Hispanic. U.S. census data shows the state is nearly 87% white, 6% black and 7% Latino.</p>
      <p>Of the 28 fatal and nonfatal police shootings so far this year, 26 involved an armed suspect.</p>
      <p>Wisconsin is one of 34 states that do not require officers to train in de-escalation, which many departments do not prioritize.</p>
      <p>John Roman, an economist who studies police shootings, says de-escalation training leads to fewer shots by officers.</p>
