      </p>
      <p>The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has congratulated its presidential candidate for the 2019 general elections, <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/1435-atiku-abubakar.html">Atiku Abubakar</a>, on the occasion of his 73rd birthday.</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng </b>reports that the party in a statement issued on Monday, November 25, by its national publicity secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, described the former vice president as an exceptional patriot who leads light and incontrovertible symbol of the collective quest by Nigerians for justice for all.</p>
      <p>The statement read: <i>"Atiku Abubakar is an exceptional patriot, quintessential democrat, leading light and incontrovertible symbol of the collective quest by Nigerians for a united, peaceful, secure, democratic and prosperous nation governed by the rule of law, equity and justice for all.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"Indeed, Atiku Abubakar leads the trail in the hope for a much-desired national rebirth, anchored on purposeful leadership where the overall interest of the people is over and above selfish personal interests."</i>

      </p>
      <p>According to the statement, <i>"It is therefore lamentable that at the time our nation would have been enjoying the dividends of Atiku Abubakarâ€™s blueprint for economic recovery and political stability, our citizens are rather groaning under prevailing harsh economic polices, excruciating multiple taxes, worsened security situation and degenerated poverty in the land."</i></p>
      <p>The PDP claimed that the nation would have been enjoying a breath of fresh air had Atiku won February 23, presidential election.</p>
      <p>It added that the former vice president had demonstrated in all spheres of life that the true worth of leadership is in applying the powers for the collective good of the people.</p>
      <p><i>"The PDP therefore joins family members, millions of compatriots, friends and associates in celebrating Atiku Abubakar, while supplicating the Almighty God to continue to bless him and keep him in good health as he applies his wealth of experience and goodwill for the service of our dear fatherland,"</i> the statement read.</p>
