      <p>PHOENIX â€” A hit and run driver is accused of leaving the area without getting help for a pedestrian that is now paralyzed.</p>
      <p>Phoenix police report that on November 14, they responded to 43rd Avenue and Thomas Road for a hit and run crash.</p>
      <p>Police say a 31-year-old man was crossing the street when a woman driving a Toyota Camry struck him. Court records show that the man suffered a broken left arm and is now paralyzed from the neck down.</p>
      <p>Witnesses at the scene gave police a description of the driver, later identified as 40-year-old Emma Mae Marcum.</p>
      <p>Marcum allegedly called the police saying her car was stolen. However, witnesses identified her as the person driving the vehicle at the time of the crash.</p>
      <p>Court records show that Marcum eventually admitted to hitting the man and falsely saying her car was stolen.</p>
      <p>She has been charged with leaving the scene of an injury accident and forgery.</p>
