      <h1>Frenchman, actor kidnapped in Mexico freed: officials</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:50:11+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:50</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>A French citizen and a Mexican actor kidnapped in a national park in central Mexico were freed Monday, officials said.</p>
      <p>The two men, identified as Frederic Michel and Alejandro Sandi, were traveling in all-terrain vehicles in the park around the Nevado de Toluca volcano when they were ambushed and abducted on Sunday, witnesses said.</p>
      <p>"Both the French and Mexican nationals have been freed," a Mexican government official told AFP.</p>
      <p>The French and Mexican governments later also confirmed the men had been freed, without giving further details.</p>
      <p>A source with Mexico's anti-kidnapping unit told AFP both victims were unharmed.</p>
      <p>The news came shortly after Mexican Security Minister Alfonso Durazo said the kidnappers had demanded a ransom.</p>
      <p>"There have been communications, and a ransom payment was, in effect, requested," Durazo told journalists.</p>
      <p>"We hope to have good news very soon."</p>
      <p>The French foreign ministry thanked the Mexican authorities for their "vital help" in ensuring the victims were freed.</p>
      <p>Mexico's anti-kidnapping office vowed to continue the investigation "with the aim of finding those responsible."</p>
      <p>Police and National Guard troops had launched a search in the area around the snow-capped volcano, which is located about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of Mexico City and is popular with hikers and campers.</p>
      <p>Sandi is an actor who played a secondary role in the TV series "Lord of the Skies," a drama about drug traffickers broadcast by US-based Latin American network Telemundo.</p>
      <p>Two Mexican actresses traveling with him said gunmen intercepted them and took their car by force, but let them go free.</p>
      <p>"We were on our way to visit the Nevado de Toluca when armed men blocked the road and took our car," actress and singer Esmeralda Ugalde said in a video posted on Twitter, speaking alongside fellow actress Vanessa Arias.</p>
      <p>Mexico has seen a surge in kidnappings this year: 1,700 from January to October, a rate of more than five per day -- a 38 percent increase on the same period last year, according to the watchdog group Alto al Secuestro (Halt Kidnapping).</p>
      <p>Foreigners are regularly targeted, but details are often scarce, and authorities rarely give information on the negotiations leading to victims' release.</p>
      <p>Leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December 2018, is struggling to rein in violent crime widely blamed on Mexico's drug cartels and other criminal gangs.</p>
      <p>This year appears on track to break Mexico's murder record, with 28,741 so far.</p>
