      <h2>Emmerdale viewers saw Al Chapman exposed, as Dawn Taylor uncovered his huge secret - and his lie about Billy Fletcher</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:11:51+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:11</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Emmerdale viewers learned what Al Chapman had been hiding in the latest episode of the ITV soap, as he landed former stepson Billy Fletcher in trouble.</p>
      <p>The character was brutally attacked by a mystery culprit last week, with Billy instantly blamed after their earlier showdown.</p>
      <p>Billy was forced to claim innocence, as Al told Dawn Taylor, Jai Sharma and Kim Tate that he was his attacker.</p>
      <p>Jai threatened to call the police, with Al determined this would not happen - knowing full well he had nothing to do with the assault.</p>
      <p>But Billy isn't the only one Al could have placed in harm's way due to his secret, with it confirmed the character is battling debt.</p>

      <p>On Monday, Dawn followed him to a meeting with two mystery men who were revealed to be working for a loan shark.</p>
      <p>They were there to collect money from Al that he owed, with him in severe debt to someone.</p>
      <p>He was told if he didn't pay up, they were going to kill him.</p>

      <p>It then became clear why Al was so desperate to get his son Ellis, Billy's brother, to invest in his buisness.</p>
      <p>He wanted Ellis to give him the money so he could pay off the debt, not worrying about the consequences for his son.</p>
      <p>Viewers will have to wait and see what Dawn will do with this information, especially after almost landing Billy in trouble.</p>

      <p>Ellis will be back in the village soon, with his return said to come about after Billy and Al clash yet again.</p>
      <p>There will be a new actor playing the role of Ellis when he returns, while it's not yet known if he'll forgive his dad.</p>
      <p>Actor Aaron Anthony will now be playing the role, after original actor Asan N'Jie was sacked by the ITV soap in September.</p>
      <p>He was involved in an incident with Hollyoaks actor Jamie Lomas at the TV Choice Awards 2019, where he threatened violence towards the fellow soap star - leading to the soap axing him from the role.</p>
