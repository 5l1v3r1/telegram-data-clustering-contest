      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a>’s AJ Pritchard has blamed the judges for his and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/saffron-barker/">Saffron Barker</a>’s elimination this weekend after they underscored their samba routine.</p>
      <p>The pair scored just 26 out of 40 for their samba dance to Walking On Sunshine, placing joint bottom of the leaderboard at the end of Saturday’s live show.</p>
      <p>After failing to get the votes from the public to stay, the pair landed in the dance-off with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/karim-zeroual/">Karim Zeroual</a> and Amy Dowden, with the judges voting unanimously to save Karim and Amy.</p>
      <p>Speaking on It Takes Two this evening to discuss their exit, AJ made no secret of the fact that he thought that they should’ve earned a higher mark.</p>
      <p>‘[Saffron] did amazing, you attacked it so positively and for me the dance was great,’ he said, adding pointedly, ‘Which I felt was underscored.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘Our fans saved us definitely, I feel like the judges sent home. It was a sad evening.’</p>

      <p>‘I didn’t see any of them technical issues, I’m going to throw it out there,’ he told Rylan when discussing the critiques they received.</p>

      <p>‘Obviously the five [score] from Craig, oh Jesus, I took that one to the heart,’ he added.</p>
      <p>Saffron was left in tears on Sunday night’s show after being told she wouldn’t be going through to the quarter finals musicals week next week.</p>

      <p>‘I’d like to thank AJ so much, when I look at what I was like on week one I was so embarrassed and shy.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘He’s really taken me out of my shell. Thank you so much for everything.’</p>
