      <p>"Shutting down 25 percent of Minor League Baseball teams, as you have proposed, would be an absolute disaster for baseball fans, workers and communities throughout the country," Sanders' letter reads. "Not only would your extreme proposal destroy thousands of jobs and devastate local economies, it would be terrible for baseball."</p>

      </p>
      <p>Sanders also cites the small pay of minor leaguers, damning the sport's billionaire owners for wanting to pad their pockets before paying minor leaguers a fair, living wage.</p>
      <p>The plan, proposed by MLB, would eliminate 42 minorleague teams(of 160)across the country, most from rookie leagues. Also part of the plan would be settinga franchiselimit of 150 players in a minorleague system and shortening the MLB Draft to 20 rounds.</p>
      <p>Sanders (D, Vt.), spoke out on the subjectNov. 17, doubling down on pitcherSean Doolittle's comments; Doolittle condemned the idea of contracting MiLB.</p>
      <p>Sean is absolutely right. Closing down Minor League teams, like the Vermont Lake Monsters, would be a disaster for baseball fans, workers, and communities across the country. We must protect these teams from corporate greed. <a href="https://t.co/g8BZi6HGeH">https://t.co/g8BZi6HGeH</a></p>
