      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:29:59+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:29</time> by <a rel="author">Amber Hicks, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>The mother of Lucy McHugh has told how her ‘blood turned to ice’ when she discovered her daughter had been raped and killed by their lodger.</p>
      <p>The 13-year-old's body was discovered in woodland with 27 stab wounds near Southampton Outdoor Sports Centre last July.</p>
      <p>Lucy had been lured there by "evil, narcissistic monster" Stephen Nicholson, 25, who killed the teen to prevent her revealing he had been sexually abusing her.</p>
      <p>The paedophile tattoo artist had been grooming Lucy since she was 12.</p>
      <p>"Depraved" Nicholson, who was <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-lucy-mchughs-murderer-who-18344063">jailed for life</a> with a minimum sentence of 33 years, had been lodging in the family's house and was the 'best friend' of Lucy's stepfather.</p>

      <p>More than a year on from the horrific ordeal, Lucy's mum Stacey White, 31, has laid bare the everlasting impact it has had.</p>
      <p>She has recalled how the last conversation she had with her daughter was saying goodbye as she left for work.</p>
      <p>Lucy replied: "OK mum, see you when you get back".</p>
      <p>Stacey told the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10417877/lucy-mchugh-mum-daughter-raped-killed-narcissistic-monster/">Sun Online:</a> "I never could have imagined that would be the very last time I heard Lucy's voice, or saw my beautiful daughter alive."</p>

      <p>She added: "As the hours ticked by, I began to worry. I hadn't heard from Lucy, which was unlike her, and when I messaged her friend [who she was supposed to be spending the day with], she said she hadn't seen her."</p>
      <p>Stacey frantically began sending messages asking if anyone knew of Lucy's whereabouts before contacting police.</p>
      <p>"Every single hour that ticked by was torture. I prayed for Lucy to walk through the door. But there was nothing," the mum added.</p>
      <p>Nicholson claimed he hadn't seen Lucy since the previous week and messaged Stacey: "I hope they find her safe. Police are good at their job and they will find her soon, keep your chin up and stay positive."</p>

      <p>Shortly afterwards, Lucy's body was discovered.</p>
      <p>"I felt my blood turn to ice inside my veins," said Stacey.</p>
      <p>"The room began to spin, and I had the sudden urge to vomit. I dashed from the room, feeling like my whole world was about to implode. I couldn’t breathe."</p>
      <p>Stacey's "world came tumbling down" and her heart "almost stopped" when she discovered Nicholson - the man who they had invited into the family home - had been arrested over Lucy's death.</p>

      <p>Nicholson had been taken in by Stacey and her partner Richard Elmes in the spring of 2017.</p>
      <p>Having moved out of Lucy's home days before the killing, he launched the 'controlled and repetitive' attack to silence the teen, who incorrectly told him she was pregnant.</p>
      <p>Jurors heard excerpts from Lucy's diary entries and notes dating back to May 2017 in which she wrote that Nicholson took her virginity and described his penis piercing.</p>
      <p>In one note titled 'abuse', Lucy wrote that he would 'make me... rape me anyway', before detailing how she was forced to lock herself in the bathroom to avoid sex.</p>
      <p>Other entries described how Nicholson choked her during sex.</p>
      <p>He denied killing Lucy - but a jury saw through his web of lies.</p>
