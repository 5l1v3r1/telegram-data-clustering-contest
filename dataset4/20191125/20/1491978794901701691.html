        <i>Labour blames disparity in figures on chronic underfunding of justice system</i>
      </p>
      <p>Domestic-abuse related cases referred to prosecutors for consideration for charge have fallen 11% in a year despite a surge in the number of crimes recorded by police.</p>
      <p>There were a total of 1,316,800 domestic abuse-related incidents and crimes recorded by the police in England and Wales in the year to March, up 118,706 from the previous year, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/office-for-national-statistics">Office for National Statistics</a> said.</p>
      <p>But police only made 98,470 referrals to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/crown-prosecution-service">Crown Prosecution Service</a> for suspects in domestic-abuse related cases to be charged, down 11% from 110,653 the previous year. The charging rate fell slightly from 76% to 74% during that time.</p>
      <p>The statistics, which released on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, show coercive control offences have nearly doubled in the year to March and killings related to domestic abuse now account for 20% of homicides.</p>
      <p>Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, said: “This is proof that the Conservatives’ strategy for dealing with domestic violence is not fit for purpose. Despite claiming to be on the side of victims, they offer nothing but empty words.</p>
      <p>“Today is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and these statistics show how far short the Tory government has fallen of achieving that aim. These figures need to be understood in the context of the Conservatives’ chronic underfunding of our justice system which leaves police overworked and the CPS treating victims as numbers rather than people.</p>
      <p>“While the Tories offer nothing but inaction, Labour is putting forward a radical plan to protect victims and fight the shameful scourge of domestic violence.”</p>
      <p>The number of incidents of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/21/this-is-not-love-victim-of-coercive-control-says-she-saw-red-flags-from-start">coercive control</a> rose from 9,053 in the year to March 2018 to 17,616 for the same period this year. Although the ONS report said such increases were “common for new offences and the rise could be attributed to improvements in recognising incidents of coercive control by the police and using the new law accordingly”.</p>
      <p>There were 366 domestic homicides recorded by the police in England and Wales between April 2016 and March 2018, accounting for 20% of all killings of victims aged over 16.</p>
      <p>The deputy chief constable, Louisa Rolfe, who leads the National <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/police">Police</a> Chiefs’ Council’s work on domestic abuse, said the fall in charging referrals was “concerning” and it was working with the CPS to “understand the complex reasons for this”.</p>
      <p>She added: “The large increases in reporting comes alongside more complex and demanding investigations and the pressure on police resources. Arrests and prosecutions may provide a temporary respite for victims but a public health response is vital to keep people safe and provide a lasting solution.”</p>
      <p>Just over a third – 35% – of the 1,671,039 offences of violence against a person during this period were domestic abuse-related.</p>
      <p>Adina Claire, the acting co-chief executive of Women’s Aid, said: “It is encouraging that the coercive control legislation is being used more and that recorded incidents have almost doubled.</p>
      <p>“However, domestic abuse remains at epidemic levels, with an estimated 1.6 million women experiencing domestic abuse last year alone. Despite this, police are making fewer referrals to the CPS and there has been a decrease in the proportion of female victims reporting domestic abuse to the police.”</p>
      <p>The government’s domestic abuse bill was introduced to parliament in July. However, the legislation was not enacted before parliament was dissolved so the bill is in limbo. The Conservatives have pledged to pass the bill if they return to government. The party has been approached for comment.</p>
