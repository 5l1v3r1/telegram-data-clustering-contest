      <h1>White House: We're Preparing for a Senate Impeachment Trial, But House Democrats Might Not Go There</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:15:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://townhall.com/author/katiepavlich" target="_blank">Katie Pavlich</a></address>
      <p>During an interview with Face the Nation over the weekend, Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway said the White House is preparing for an impeachment trial in the Senate if Democrats in the House choose to move forward with the process.</p>
      <p>"If it does go to a trial in the Senate, and that is not certain right now, you have a lot of Democrats wringing their hands that they did not see...overwhelming, compelling, clear and convincing evidence. Many of those Democrats, especially the ones who represent the 31 Trump/Pence districts in 2016, they have to go back home and say 'I know I promised to lower your drug prices. I know I promised to keep this great economy going on. I know I promised trade deals like USMCA, but we're busy impeaching a president,'" Conway said.</p>
      <p>"They're getting blowback for that. So, I think for those Democrats it's not completely certain yet. Some of them have gone on the second saying they're not there yet," she continued.</p>

      <p>Last week President Trump <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2019/11/22/president-trump-on-senate-impeachment-trial-bring-it-on-n2556926">said</a> he wants a Senate trial should the House vote to pass articles of impeachment. </p>
      <p>"Frankly, I want a trial," Trump said. "They’ve looked like fools over the last five days."</p>
      <p>"There's nothing there," he continued. “There’s only one person I want more than where’s Hunter and that is Adam Schiff...I want to see Adam Schiff testify about the whistleblower...the whistleblower in my opinion is a political operative just like his lawyer...the one I want to testify the most is shifty Schiff."</p>
      <p>House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff is now working with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler on which  articles of impeachment they think will apply.</p>
