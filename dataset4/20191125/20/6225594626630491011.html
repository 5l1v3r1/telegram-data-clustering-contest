        <b>Pinterest announced the launch of a new hand-curated shopping profile called Pinterest Shop, in celebration of Small Business Saturday on Nov. 30.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Unlike other platforms – where some content will need to compete with personal photos – everything on Pinterest can be <a href="https://wersm.com/pinterests-lens-can-now-identify-over-2-5-billion-home-and-fashion-objects/">shoppable</a>, and so small businesses can better reach and connect with Pinners in a truly authentic way. This is because <a href="https://wersm.com/category/other/pinterest">Pinterest</a> is a “visual discovery engine,” and “not a social network,” so there’s a lot of value in the open mindset that Pinners have as a result.</p>
      <p>It’s that open mindset that brings people Pinterest – to discover new ideas and new brands to shop. To reinforce this, and to celebrate Small Business Saturday this week, Pinterest has <a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/pinterestshop">launched Pinterest Shop</a>, where Pinners can discover and shop unique products from small businesses.</p>
      <p>The profile is hand-curated by Pinterest and features hundreds of shoppable Product Pins from 17 different small businesses. The small businesses chosen to be part of <a href="https://pinterest.com/shop/">Pinterest Shop</a> all “make and sell unique goods, are mission-driven, diverse, and have uploaded their product catalog to Pinterest.”</p>
      <p>The latter makes their products automatically available to buy, as shoppable Product Pins.</p>
      <p>Each of the 17 boards on Pinterest Shop highlights the creativity, craftsmanship, and entrepreneurship of the small businesses involved, and feature around 20 products to give Pinners a better idea of each business and its “world.” Finally, each Pin takes them to the small business’ checkout page, allowing them to buy the products directly.</p>
      <p>Pinterest says it will “continue updating the account with products from select businesses,” but the business profiles currently on there are:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/thecitizenry/">The Citizenry</a> was founded by two college friends, Carly Nance and Rachel Bentley, in Dallas, Texas. After growing frustrated by the mass-produced goods offered by traditional retailers, they set out to transform modern home goods with The Citizenry, a company that celebrates the artisans behind the products. Each season, they introduce a new collection from a new corner of the world.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/aplatcollection/">Aplat Collection</a> Founded by Shujan Bertrand in San Francisco, Aplat is a culinary design company that makes products centered around sharing food, wine, and flowers. Shujan was inspired by her years spent in France for this collection — her designs embrace a more sustainable future, crafted to conserve and replenish limited resources by using them more wisely and efficiently.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/hyggelightcandles/">Hyggelight</a> After moving to Ohio from Florida, Cyndi Hileman looked for ways to survive a harsh winter in her new state. She turned to Pinterest and typed: How to be happy in the winter? She discovered the Danish concept of hygge and the importance of candles to create the perfect atmosphere. She also discovered seed paper and decided to combine both to give candles a second life. <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/753719687611794937/">The Growing Candle</a> was born.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/swellforever/">Swell Forever</a> Swell Forever was founded by Atlanta native Brooke Henze in 2014. In 2012, she walked away from a stable job in San Francisco and tried to make sense of what to do with her life. The idea dawned on her that few gift options on the market come from the heart. She came up with the Forever Blanket, her first collection of customized heirloom gifts. For every blanket purchased, Swell Forever makes a donation to their adoption fund.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/theneonmuse/">The Neon Muse</a> By fusing technology and fashion, The Neon Muse delivers custom light up apparel for men, women, and children. Each jacket is handmade in Las Vegas and a portion of the proceeds going to a charity specific to that design. Founder Katarina Simic started the company in 2017 with the intention of translating neon signs and their aesthetic to wearable art on clothing. After wearing a sample out to an event, she got an overwhelmingly positive response and knew she had to make it into a business.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/fountleathergoods/">FOUNT</a> In early 2014, husband and wife Phillip and Jackie Wachter began making leather bags in their kitchen with a World War II sewing machine they found on Craigslist. They now run a bustling creative studio in downtown Cleveland, employing 46 team members and counting.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/shopflyaway/">Flyaway Bluejay</a> Holly Feld fell in love with scent at a young age collecting perfumes and candles on every occasion and every trip. To continue her passion for a beautifully scented home, she started creating her line of naturally scented products called Flyaway Bluejay. Her candles are made of plant-based wax and are scented with essential oils. She uses Pinterest to create a lifestyle around her brand and reach new customers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/artofthegent/">Art of the Gentleman</a> Art of The Gentleman’s founders, Robert Remak, Devin Panlaque, and Trevor Blessinger, met in a corporate office where they bonded over their passion for style. What started as a friendly feud over who had the best looks, turned into an office following where their co-workers would ask for advice. They decided to create an outlet that represented all of their unique styles and would make dressing up easier for those who aspire to the Gentleman Moniker.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/hartandjoy/">Hart Studio</a> Designer Hart Hagerty lived in Shanghai for six years after majoring in Mandarin from Vanderbilt University in 2009. Upon her return to Charleston, she launched HART STUDIO, her line of tassel earrings inspired by traditional Chinese designs and produced entirely by Chinese artisans.

      <p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/ettaandbillie/">Etta + Billie </a>Alana Rivera is the founder of Etta + Billie, an all-natural skincare line for foodies.

Cardamom Old Fashioned became Grapefruit Cardamom Body Oil. Alana, a long-time user of Pinterest, turns to the platform to find inspiration on how to style her photoshoots and packaging ideas.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/moonpicnic/">Moon Picnic</a> Moon Picnic co-founder, Sam Miller, travels the world looking for the best toys books and objects to inspire his customers. “The range of toys available in the mainstream market in the United States is narrow. We wanted to introduce some unusual and artistic designs that sparked children’s imagination and creativity.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/littleblueoliveshop/">Little Blue Olive</a> Seven years ago, a mother-daughter duo, Brandy and Terri Bashkingy, founded Little Blue Olive, a small business based in Vancouver, Washington, making crown headbands for birthdays. They create beautifully designed and customizable birthday crowns and party hats for babies, toddlers, children, and adults that are perfect for celebrating every event.

He went on to win $100,000 and invest in their first business.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/indegoafrica/">Indego Africa</a> Indego Africa is a non-profit organization dedicated to empowering artisan women in Africa through employment opportunities and education.

      <p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/stasherbag/">Stasher</a> Frustrated by the plastic waste choking our planet, Kat Nouri invented Stasher—the first endlessly reusable and radically functional silicone bag with a Pinch Loc seal that you can cook, store, and freeze in. Stasher is the perfect innovation for travel and organization. It has not only disrupted the food storage industry but also prevented nearly one billion single-use plastic baggies from piling up in landfills and polluting our oceans.</p>
