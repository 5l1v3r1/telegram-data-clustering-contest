      <p>The GBP/USD pair rose on Monday, ending the American session around 1.2900, with a gain of 65 pips. <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd">The pound</a> was among the top performers as polls show the Conservative Party leading ahead of the general election in the United Kingdom. </p>
      <p>Expectations of a significant victory for Conservatives increase the odds of a Brexit deal passing the UK Parliament. Prime Minister Johnson’s party announced it would seek a vote on the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/events/brexit">Brexit</a> deal before Christmas. Also, better-than-expected data contribute to support the pound in the market as the CBI Distributive Trade Survey on realized sales improved to in November to -3 from the previous -10.</p>
      <p>The US dollar posted mix results on Monday. It lost ground during the Asian session but the recovered strength on the back of higher US yields. The DXY rose 0.05% and posted the highest daily close since November 13, above 98.30. </p>
      <h3>Cable with neutral outlook ahead of the Asian session </h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/gbp-usd-forecast-election-polls-set-the-tone-for-pound-201911251940">Valeria Bednarik, Chief Analysts at FXStreet,</a> sees the GBP/USD neutral in the short term. “In the 4 hours <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart">chart</a>, the price is battling with directionless 20 and 100 SMA, but above a bullish 200 SMA. Technical <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> lack directional strength, although the Momentum is leaning lower within negative territory, while the RSI steadies around its mid-line.”</p>
      <p>Bednarik adds the GBP/USD managed to recover from the 1.2810 price zone, a critical <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> support. “Slides will likely remain contained as long as the price holds above this last.”</p>
