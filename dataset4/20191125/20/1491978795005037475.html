      <h1>Ben Stokes on pole to take BBC sports personality of the year award</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:24:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/seaningle" target="_blank">Sean Ingle</a></address>

        <i>• Dina Asher-Smith and Katarina Johnson-Thompson in frame <br/>• Raheem Sterling, AW Jones and Lewis Hamilton shortlisted</i>
      </p>
      <p>Ben Stokes will face competition from Dina Asher-Smith, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/katarina-johnson-thompson">Katarina Johnson-Thompson</a> and Raheem Sterling as he seeks to become the first cricketer since 2005 to win the BBC sports personality of the year award.</p>
      <p>Alun Wyn Jones, who inspired Wales to the Grand Slam and the semi-finals of the rugby World Cup, and Lewis Hamilton, who won a sixth Formula One world title, are the other names on the six-strong shortlist.</p>
      <p>However, there is no place for any of England’s World Cup squad despite their stunning <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/26/england-new-zealand-rugby-world-cup-semi-final-match-report">victory over New Zealand in the semi-finals</a>, or Jofra Archer, whose venomous bowling in the cricket World Cup and Ashes lit up the sporting summer.</p>
      <p>The bookmakers make Stokes a prohibitive 1-6 favourite for the award after he scored 84 not out in England’s World Cup final super-over victory against New Zealand – and then followed it a month later with a swashbuckling <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/25/australia-ashes-england-third-test-ben-stokes-sensational">135 not out to guide England to an unlikely win</a> in the third Test against Australia at Headingley.</p>
      <p>Stokes’ closest rival is likely to be Asher-Smith, who became the first British woman to win global gold in a sprint event when she stormed to victory over 200m at the world championships in Doha. The 23-year-old also won world silver medals in the 100m and 4x100m, and the Diamond League 100m title.</p>
      <p>The athletics vote is likely to be split with Johnson-Thompson, who set four personal bests and broke Jessica Ennis-Hill’s British record in winning world championship heptathlon gold in October, also a live contender. Sterling would be the first footballer since Ryan Giggs in 2009 to win the event, which takes place on Sunday 15 December in Aberdeen.</p>
      <p>Last year the Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas took home the trophy, ahead of Hamilton and the Spurs striker Harry Kane.</p>
