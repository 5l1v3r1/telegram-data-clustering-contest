      <p>EDMONTON -- RCMP have laid charges against a man after the death of his baby in Fort Saskatchewan on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Emergency crews were called to a home in Fort Saskatchewan around 6:43 p.m. on Saturday for reports of a baby in medical distress. A one-year-old boy was taken to hospital, where he died.</p>
      <p>Police say there was a second child at the scene, who suffered non-life threatening injuries.</p>
      <p>The baby has been identified on a GoFundMe page as one-year-old Ares.</p>
      <p>Damien Christopher Starrett, 30, of Fort Saskatchewan has been charged with second-degree murder in connection with the death of the baby, and assault against the second child.</p>
      <p>Police confirmed that Starrett is the father of the two children. They also said he is known to police.  </p>
      <p>A court check by CTV News Edmonton shows Starrett has a lengthy criminal record consisting of criminal harassment, assault with a weapon or causing bodily harm, uttering threats and mischief.</p>
      <p>"This is an extremely tragic situation for this family and the community at large,” said Inspector Michael McCauley, detachment commander for Fort Saskatchewan RCMP.</p>
      <p>"It's concerning to everyone from the family to the first responders to the members of the public... This is a close-knit community. This is a very trying time for us."</p>
      <p>Investigators do not expect any further charges to be laid.</p>
      <p>Starrett is scheduled to appear in Fort Saskatchewan Provincial Court on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The family is being offered multiple support resources, police said.</p>
      <p>“Several RCMP units are involved in this investigation and the Zebra Child Protection Center has provided their expertise. In the interest of protecting the wellbeing of the family members, the RCMP are asking the media to respect the family’s privacy."</p>
