      <h3>Tabloid-Size Printing...and Beyond</h3>
      <p>Once upon a time, there were two kinds of <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/printers/154/the-best-printers">printers</a>—letter-size ones, and bigger ones—and seldom did the two share much in common. <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/inkjet-printers/71175/the-best-inkjet-printers">Inkjet printers</a> that could print bigger than letter-size were traditionally expensive, dedicated models reserved for professionals: graphic artists outputting poster-size media, or pro photographers fashioning outsize versions of their best shots. Meanwhile, the very largest models—"large-format" plotters, the big, roll-fed mega-printers you may see in passing at Fedex/Kinko's and graphics shops—were the province of architects and others who needed blanket-size prints for schematics and other technical output. These big printers had big prices to match their specialist bearings. And they still do.</p>
      <p>In recent years, though, we've seen a trend toward incorporating limited support for oversize output into consumer and small-business inkjet printers. You won't be able to print poster-size 24-by-36-inch output on these models (at least, not on one sheet without tiling), but these models can do 11-by-17-inch prints (and in some cases, 13-by-19-inch) in small quantities.</p>
      <h3>The Occasional Oversizers</h3>
      <p>If we had to give this emerging group of printers a name, we'd call them "the occasional oversizers."</p>
      <p>They're a mixed bag, and their dynamics change every time one of the major printer makers introduces a new oversize-capable model. But they're here to stay, as more and more buyers take a fling on these models and realize just how handy it is to be able to print to big sheets now and then. You no longer have to compress and shrink that complex spreadsheet to a single letter-size page, or tape together tiled sheets. And the ability to do a one-off giant vacation-picture print for framing is nice—and many of these printers listed below are very capable of fine photo output.</p>
      <p>Pricing on these models varies a bit, but most of the all-in-one machines in the lot we've reviewed below range from $150 to $300.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/573000-wide-format-printers.jpg?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>One thing to note: We've intentionally not covered here professional and semi-pro, photo-centric wide-format models like the venerable <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/review/286713/epson-stylus-photo-r2000">Epson Stylus Photo R2000</a>, Epson's various SureColor printers, and the <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/review/300570/canon-pixma-pro-1">Canon Pixma Pro-1</a>, <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/canon-pixma-pro-100">Pixma Pro-100</a>, and <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/canon-imageprograf-pro-1000/84173/review/canon-imageprograf-pro-1000">ImagePrograf Pro-1000</a>. These are really a <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/photo-printers/7928/the-best-photo-printers">separate class of printer</a> altogether, with a whole different set of considerations around quality, sheer size, ink cost, and support for exotic art-minded media.</p>
      <p>If you're looking for the ability to output to bigger-than-letter-size paper stock every now and then, here are the main factors to contemplate.</p>
      <h3>Paper-Size Terminology</h3>
      <p>The most common inkjet "oversize" paper is known as <i>tabloid</i> stock, or 11 by 17 inches. (The term "tabloid" is also, at times, used interchangeably with "A3," but they are actually two different sizes, if functionally close; A3 measures 11.69 by 16.54 inches.) All of the printers we've rounded up below support at least tabloid printing.</p>
      <p>Some of them, however, also support 13-by-19-inch media, or supertabloid. One example is the Epson WorkForce WF-7110. But note that tabloid and supertabloid printing are often referred to collectively as "wide-format" output in the industry lingo.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/572997-epson-s-workforce-wf-7110.jpg?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Paper Handling</h3>
      <p>This varies widely, and it has a bearing on just how "occasional use" your printer will be for oversize printing. Some models are best suited for printing a single oversize page once in a while, not churning them out in great stacks. That's because they feed the oversize stock, one sheet at a time, through a paper-bypass slot on the back of the printer. Conversely, models like the HP Officejet Pro 7740 have a tray or trays meant for pre-loading a supply of wide-format stock—which means much less babysitting for multiple-page oversize prints. (That Officejet, for example, has two trays that can each hold stock up to 11 by 17 inches in size.)</p>
      <h3>ADF Details</h3>
      <p>Some, but not all, of these printers here have an automatic document feeder (ADF) that handles scanning documents. Of course, that only applies if the printer is an all-in-one (AIO) model. Don't assume, however, that the ADF can necessarily handle all the same paper sizes that the printer can print; check out the details on the manufacturer's spec sheet. Some models may print to tabloid-size stock, but can only scan letter- or legal-size documents.</p>
      <p>Also know that ADF functionality varies quite a bit. Some models can scan both sides of their source sheets automatically (a feature known as "auto-duplexing"), others not. An ADF that cannot auto-duplex will require you to flip double-sided source materials manually to scan or copy both sides, and collation thus may be tricky.</p>
      <p>Another ADF-related detail to keep an eye out for has to do with the scanning element itself. An emerging feature on higher-end AIO printers is the "single-pass" scanner, which has a scanning element above and below the feed path. A single-pass scanner can thus scan both sides of a two-sided document at the same time, effectively doubling the scan speed.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>The Importance of Connectivity</h3>
      <p>Wide-format printers, even occasional-use models like these, are far from the subcompacts of the printer world. Because their printer paths are by necessity at least 11 or 13 inches wide, you're looking at a printer that takes up lots of desk space because of its extra width versus a letter-size model. Look for built-in Wi-Fi (not always a given), which will give you the flexibility to place your "oversized oversize" printer in a convenient spot without worrying about running Ethernet or USB cables to it.</p>
      <p>Other connectivity features worth investigating include slots for flash-memory cards (if printing directly from camera-media cards is important to you) and a USB port on the front for printing straight from a tethered digital camera, a USB flash drive, or a hard drive. (That's in addition to the conventional USB interface that most inkjets feature.) Some models may support near-field communication (NFC), which implements a hotspot on the front or top of the printer, for wireless tap-to-connect printing from NFC-compliant mobile devices such as smartphones.</p>
      <p>You'll also want to look for other support for printing from mobile devices you may own. If you lean Apple in the gear you own, you'll want to look for support for AirPrint; if Android is your tipple, support for the MOPRIA specification will ease printing from that Android tablet or phone.</p>
      <h3>Ink Cost Per Page</h3>
      <p>Here's where our reviews come in. These printers vary widely in price and intended usage, as do their ink schemes: the number and configuration of ink tanks, and their rated costs for each color or monochrome page. Business-centric models will typically have four ink tanks (cyan, magneta, yellow, and black), while photo-minded ones will usually add another tank or two. (These are often lighter variants of the three CMY colors, or a "photo gray" for finer gradations in monochrome printed content.)</p>
      <p>Printing full-page color photos on oversize stock with 100 percent ink coverage can drink down a lot of precious ink quickly, so examine our reviews below for more on the ink economics for each printer.</p>

Good text quality. Ethernet, Wi-Fi, USB, and HP wireless direct connectivity. Scans at up to legal size. Prints at up to tabloid (11-by-17 inches) size.<b>Cons: </b>Slightly sub-par graphics and photo quality. Not the lowest running costs in its class. <b>Bottom Line: </b>The HP OfficeJet Pro 7720 Wide Format All-in-One Printer is a good choice for small or micro offices, but it's worth paying a bit extra for a more feature-rich competitor.<a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/hp-officejet-pro-7720-wide-format-all-in-one-printer/91237/review/hp-officejet-pro-7720-wide-format-all-in-one-printer">Read Review</a><br/><br/></pre>
