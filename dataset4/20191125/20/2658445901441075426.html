      <p>The All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, has pleaded with all APC state governors to implement the N30,000 minimum wage and the consequential adjustments.</p>
      <p>Oshiomhole made the plea on Monday in Jos at the Federal Government- Progressives Governors Forum parley in Jos.</p>
      <p>“As progressives, let us be the first to pay the new national minimum wage and not just the wage but also the consequential adjustments arising from it.</p>
      <p>“Already, there are some proactive progressive governors that have taken steps to address this.</p>
      <p>“I plead that you give this a priority, because when other governors are fighting whether or not to pay, you will say that progressive governors have paid.</p>
      <p>“Where there is will, there will certainly be a way,” he said.</p>
      <p>The APC national chairman also called on the APC governors to support border closure by the Federal Government.</p>
      <p>He said that the nation’s borders should remain closed until neighbouring countries follow the protocols of fair trade.</p>
      <p>Oshiomole in an interview with journalists, also lend his support to financial autonomy for local governments in the country.</p>
      <p>He said that local government autonomy was not negotiable.</p>

      <p>According to him, just as the Federal Government does not control state governor on how to manage his money, so should the state governors allow the local governments to function.</p>
      <p>He added that local governments should be allowed to operate the same way states operate with the Federal Government exercising oversight function.</p>
      <p>“Local governments should be autonomous, but autonomy doesn’t mean there should not be oversight.</p>
      <p>“The same way the Federal Government goes after a state Governor that breaks the financial rule, the same way state governor should go after local government that mismanages revenue that accrue to it,” he said. (</p>
