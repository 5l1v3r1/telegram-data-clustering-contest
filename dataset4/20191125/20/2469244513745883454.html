      <h1>Aldi now selling pigs in blankets made with world's second-hottest chilli</h1>
      <h2>The Trinidadian Scorpion chilli is 40 times hotter than Tabasco - think you've got what it takes?</h2>

      <p>Aldi has plans to heat you up as the weather gets cold - after it announced it was adding a little something extra to a Christmas classic.</p>
      <p>New to the German retailer this year are its Scorpion Chilli Pigs in Blankets - costing £2.29 a pack.</p>
      <p>If you've not heard of Scorpion chillis, you might be in for a surprise. Until recently, the Trinidadian Scorpion Chilli was ranked as the world's hottest, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/aldi-selling-pigs-blankets-made-20957267?utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=mirror_main&amp;fbclid=IwAR3MxTVukYS3t-qX_PI2DmtIIzsZwOs2jOafTjCM3IpFKt_kv4bY87oT558">reports the Mirror</a>.</p>
      <p>To put that in context, it's nine times hotter than a Bird's Eye chilli, six times as hot as a Scotch Bonnet and 40 times hotter than Tabasco sauce.</p>
      <p>The pig part of the Pigs in Blankets is found a little closer to home - with sausage meat and bacon coming from Red Tractor approved, 100 per cent British Pork.</p>
