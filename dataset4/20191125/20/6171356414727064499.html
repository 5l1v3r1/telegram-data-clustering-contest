      <p>If you're looking for an e-reader this <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/19/black-friday-2019/">Black Friday</a>, you're probably checking out Amazon. The company is well known for aggressive discounts on its own line of products, and <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/22/amazon-black-friday-deals-sale-2019/">this Black Friday is no exception</a>: Amazon is offering the lowest price yet on the updated base model Kindle, priced at $60 with special offers (down from $90) or $80 without special offers (down from $110).</p>
      <p>The current revision of the Kindle boasts a built-in adjustable front light, as well as classic Kindle features, like a glare-free display and extended battery life. The e-reader can be purchased with a three month free trial of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?tag=androidpolice-20">Kindle Unlimited</a>. If you're worried you'll forget to cancel the subscription once those three months are up, it's just as simple to leave it off.</p>
