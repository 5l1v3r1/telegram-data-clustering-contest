      <h1>Feds won't explain claim Trans Mountain will raise $500M in tax revenue</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:14:54+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:14</time> by <a rel="author">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>OTTAWA -- Finance Minister Bill Morneau will not explain how his department estimated that finishing the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion will bring another $500 million in corporate tax revenue into the federal government's bank account.</p>
      <p>The figure was cited by the government when it approved the project a second time last June and was also included in the Liberals' campaign platform as they attempted to show how they intend to pay for various election promises.</p>
      <p>Economist Robyn Allan says she has been trying to get Ottawa to explain its numbers for months to no avail.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Morneau says the $500 million is a Finance Canada estimate but did not answer questions about how that estimate was created.</p>
      <p>Allan says the government is using the figure to generate public support for the project and Ottawa has a responsibility to explain its origins.</p>
      <p>Canada bought the Trans Mountain pipeline from Kinder Morgan Canada in 2018 in a bid to overcome political opposition to expanding it and hopes to sell it back to the private sector once the expansion is complete.</p>
