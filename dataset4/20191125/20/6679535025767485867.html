      <p>The Narendra Modi government which had “butchered democracy in Maharashtra”, was trying to privatise even democracy, said CPI(M) Politburo member Brinda Karat, here on Monday.</p>
      <p>She was speaking after inaugurating a public meeting in Koothuparamba on the occasion of the Koothuparamba Martyrs’ Day held at the Koothuparamba municipal council stadium.</p>
      <p>Ms. Karat said the Modi government was endangering democracy in the country. The government, which had sold out the country’s natural resources and public sector enterprises, had turned democracy into a commodity. MLAs were being bought like grocery, she said, and added that democracy was misused and traded under the leadership of Home Minister Amit Shah.</p>
      <p>MLAs were like jumping frogs in the rainy season. Those in the Congress and the NCP were jumping to the BJP for money and status, she said.</p>
      <p>“Only those in the Left stand firm in the ideals”, she said.</p>
      <p>DYFI national president P.A. Mohammed Riyas; State secretary A.A. Rahim; president S. Satheesh; CPI(M) district secretary M.V. Jayarajan; State committee member P. Jayarajan; Valsan Panoli; and MLAs T.V. Rajesh and A.M Shamseer spoke.</p>
