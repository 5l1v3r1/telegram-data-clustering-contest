      <p>The <b>European Commission</b> approved nearly 94 million euros for a high-efficiency cogeneration <b>plant</b> in Bulgaria. It will generate heat and electricity of approximately 55 MW for heat and 19 MW for electricity. </p>
      <p>Nearly 180,000 tons of unrecyclable waste will be used as fuel on an annual basis. The installation, set up by Toplofikacia EAD, will be connected to the Sofia-district heating network. Its construction should complete by the end of 2023.</p>
      <p>"European support will help <b>Bulgaria</b> achieve its energy efficiency targets and contribute to reducing carbon dioxide emissions in line with EU environmental targets without unduly distorting competition," EU Competition Commissioner Margaret Westerger commented.</p>
      <p>EC funds are divided into two separate measures: a direct grant of approximately EUR 90.8 million (about BGN 177.6 million), financed by EU structural funds managed by <b>Bulgaria</b>, and a loan granted from the Sofia Municipality of Toplofikacia EAD with a preferential interest amounting to approximately EUR 3 million (about BGN 5.8 million).</p>
