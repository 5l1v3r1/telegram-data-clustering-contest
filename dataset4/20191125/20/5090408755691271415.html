      <p>Jack Quaid followed in his parents <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/dennis-quaid">Dennis Quaid</a> and <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/meg-ryan">Meg Ryan</a>‘s footsteps and <a href="https://www.insider.com/celebrity-kids-look-like-grown-up-2017-10">became an actor</a>, making a name for himself with <a href="https://www.insider.com/the-hunger-games-cast-then-and-now-photos-2019-3">roles in “The Hunger Games”</a> and the Amazon Prime Video superhero series, “The Boys.” He’s recently taken on voice acting – you can hear him on season three of “Harvey Girls Forever” as child millionaire Richie Rich.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old actor answered some rapid-fire questions for <a href="https://www.insider.com/">Insider</a> about a strange interaction he had with Christopher Walken, his immense love for “Star Wars,” and his role on the Dreamworks show, which is now streaming on Netflix.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Dream job or project in Hollywood?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Would love to be <a href="https://www.insider.com/star-wars-the-last-jedi-cast-real-life-2017-12">in a “Star Wars” movie.</a> I don’t care what the role is. I’ll be a droid, I’ll be a potted plant, I’ll be a grain of sand on Tatooine. I don’t care. Literally anything. I watched the original trilogy religiously when I was growing up so that would be incredible.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. What was the weirdest interaction you had with another celebrity?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I met <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/christopher-walken">Christopher Walken</a> in an airport when I was a kid. I went up to him and told him I was a big fan as he was squeezing a lemon into his tea. I reached out to shake his hand and he said “I’d shake your hand, but I’m squeezin’ lemons.” Later he came up to me to ask if I was “the kid from the Transformers movies.” He thought I was <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/shia-labeouf">Shia LaBeouf</a>. I was sad to tell him I was not.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. What’s the last show you binged?</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/mindhunter-real-serial-killers-compared-show-characters-2017-10">“Mindhunter.”</a> That show is spectacular.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. What’s the last thing you Googled?</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Rudy Ray Moore.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. Best birthday present you’ve ever received?</b>
      </p>
      <p>My girlfriend <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nintendo-switch-black-friday-deals">got me a Nintendo Switch</a>. That was pretty rad. Good job, Liz!</p>
      <p>
        <b>6. Who’s your most listened to artist on Spotify?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s probably Alabama Shakes or Nathaniel Rateliff &amp; The Night Sweats. They’re both amazing and I listen to them any chance I get.</p>
      <p>
        <b>7. Do you believe in ghosts and why?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I don’t know <a href="https://www.insider.com/celebrities-who-believe-in-ghosts">if I believe in ghosts</a> so much as I believe that we leave behind a certain energy and that sometimes it stays around if it’s strong enough.</p>
      <p>
        <b>8. Tell us a little about your “Harvey Girls Forever” character.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Richie is a self-made child billionaire. He has a brilliant mind that’s allowed him to amass a fortune and build a gigantic company but at the expense of learning what it’s like to be a kid. He just hasn’t had the time for it. He comes to Harvey Street to learn about childhood because it’s something that’s always fascinated him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>9. What do you love most about Richie?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I love how positive he is. No matter the situation, he finds a way to be bright and optimistic about it. I also love what the writers have done with Richie. They’ve modernized the character beautifully. In the wrong hands the character could be seen as a symbol of privilege, but this Richie is a self-made kid who shares his wealth – not a trust-fund kid who flaunts it.</p>

        <b>10. Why did you sign on for this project?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Because I’ve always wanted to be a cartoon and this was a dream come true. I was ecstatic to find out I got the part not only because I thought the show was fantastic but because I got to play a new version of a character who’s been around since the ’50s.</p>
      <p>
        <b>11. What are you most excited for fans to see on season three?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Richie has a lot of growth this season. You’ve heard of coming-of-age stories? I like to think of season three as a coming-of-childhood story for Richie. The girls help him find his inner child, get in touch with more of his emotional spectrum and find what brings him joy. I’m excited for fans to see him grow and see how he fits into the world.</p>
      <p>
        <b>12. Favorite ice cream flavor?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Moose-tracks.</p>
      <p>
        <b>13. If you could have one superpower, what would it be?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Flight. I’m sorry I know that’s the lame answer but anyone who says anything different is probably lying. I think I’ve even said a different answer to this question before because someone else said “flying” before I did. It’s flying! There’s nothing better! How would that get old? You’re flying!</p>
      <p>
        <b>14. If you had to be on a reality TV show which one would you be in?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I would love to just be <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/chris-harrison">Chris Harrison</a>. Seems like he has a pretty sweet life.</p>
      <p>
        <b>15. What are you looking forward to most in 2020?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Probably “The Last of Us Part 2.” It looks really really good. Also I’m excited for people to see season two of “The Boys.” Think we’ve cooked up something pretty special and I can’t wait for fans to see it. It’s a lot wilder and we go even deeper with the characters. It’s bonkers and I love it.</p>
