      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:41:54+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/7761/news-2/" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>Doctors examining former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in London have recommended cardiac catheterisation for a possible coronary angioplasty, a nonsurgical procedure that improves blood flow to the heart.</p>
      <p>According to Nawaz’s personal physician, Dr Adnan Khan, who is also in the British capital, the former prime minister visited Prof Simon Redwood, a Cardiovascular Interventionist at the London Bridge Hospital on Monday.</p>
      <p>“Nawaz Sharif was evaluated &amp; assessed by Prof Simon Redwood, Cardiovascular Interventionist, at London Bridge Hospital. He has recommended Cardiac Catheterization for a possible PCI once the haematology &amp; nephrology experts medically allow the invasive procedure,” Dr Khan tweeted.</p>

      <p>Cardiac catheterisation is a procedure used to diagnose and treat certain cardiovascular conditions. During cardiac catheterisation, a long thin tube called a catheter is inserted in an artery or vein in and threaded through the blood vessels to the heart.</p>
      <p>The PCI [Percutaneous coronary intervention], also known as coronary angioplasty, is a nonsurgical procedure that improves blood flow to heart. The PCI requires cardiac catheterisation.</p>
