      <p>A Moroccan court on Monday sentenced rapper Mohamed Mounir, known as Gnawi, to one year in jail for insulting police on social media.</p>
      <p>A defence lawyer said he believed his 31-year-old client was prosecuted because of a song he co-wrote about the hardships of young people in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/morocco.html">Morocco</a>, unemployment and corruption.</p>
      <p>The song, Aach al Chaab - which translates to "long live the people" - has been viewed more than 15 million times on YouTube since it was released last month.</p>
      <p>The five-minute video rages against the authorities and criticises the country's widening economic gap, a message aimed at the disillusioned younger generation.</p>
      <p>One passage of the song reflects on the Hirak protest movement in Morocco's impoverished Rif mountain region.</p>
      <p>Another section profiles a mother whose sons died attempting to migrate to Europe, while another paints a picture of a young generation ruined by hashish and hard drugs.</p>
      <p>Most shockingly to many Moroccans, the song also directly criticises Morocco's king and his adviser, a criminal offence.</p>
      <p>"I am an artist. My job is to defend my rights and the rights of the people. It was not the first time that I had been humiliated by the police," Gnawi told the court.</p>
      <p>"Since I was born, I have been humiliated," he said.</p>
      <p>Morocco, a kingdom long known for its stability in the Arab world, adopted constitutional reforms in response to the 2011 <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/arab-spring.html">Arab Spring</a> protests against corruption and abuse of power and in favour of expanding free speech.</p>
      <p>But the country is still struggling with poverty, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/corruption.html">corruption</a> and unemployment. Freedom of expression is guaranteed in the constitution, but with limits.</p>
      <p>Amnesty International called the rapper's arrest "absurd" and an "outrageous assault on free speech".</p>
      <p>But Mustapha Ramid, Morocco's minister of state in charge of human rights, told Parliament that Aach al Chaab was "provocative" and "repugnant", according to media reports.</p>
      <p>Young people make up one-third of Morocco's 35 million population. A quarter of those aged between 15 and 24 are unemployed and out of school, according to official figures.</p>
