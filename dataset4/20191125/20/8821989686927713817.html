      <h1>Mick Mars Says He Was ‘Joking’ About Free Motley Crue Tickets</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:02:48+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:02</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Lifton</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/mick-mars/">Mick Mars</a> said his Thanksgiving dinner will consist of "crow and humble pie" for comments he made five years ago concerning <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/motley-crue/">Motley Crue</a>'s decision to stop touring.</p>
      <p>Apparently, many fans didn't forget that, five years ago, Mars appeared on Eddie Trunk's <i>That Metal Show </i>and discussed the possibility of Motley Crue coming back after the end of what they were calling the Final Tour. "Let me put it this way," he said. "If that happens, I will invite the world to come for free. Free."</p>

      <p>With the band <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-blow-up-cessation-of-touring-agreement/">blowing up</a> their "<a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-cessation-of-touring-contract/">Cessation of Touring Agreement</a>" in anticipation of tour announcement last week, fans reminded Mars of his offer, which prompted a response posted on Instagram.</p>
      <p>"While I was clearly joking about free tickets that night on <i>TMS</i>, I was also deeply convinced that we would never ever be touring again," he wrote. "I would have never expected to be facing a whole new generation of fans demanding to see us play. In fact, touring with Motley Crue comes at a weird place in time, since my solo record is almost complete after such a long time of writing and recording. But I put our fans first. Anyways, I am eating a lot of crow and humble pie this Thanksgiving for those remarks and accept that some of you see this as me being dishonest. I said what I said, and I was wrong. Peace."</p>

      <p>In the years since Motley Crue's last concert, Mars worked with onetime Crue singer <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/john-corabi/">John Corabi</a> on a <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/john-corabi-mick-mars/">project</a> that never saw the light of day, with only snippets of a couple songs surfacing before the record <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/mick-mars-john-corabi-recording/">faded</a>.</p>
      <p>Mars discussed his debut solo album in March, at which point he had only the drum tracks and some bass parts recorded and was still searching for singers.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/mick-mars-solo-album-harder-than-motley-crue/">described</a> the material he's written as being "more of a heavier rock thing, but I don't wanna even try to 'out-heavy' the heavies, you know what I mean? It's just something hopefully just a little different than what's going on now. You're not gonna hear a Motley-flavored song, except for the guitar, [because] that's me. They're gonna be a bit harder than that, but not as hard as the heavies, like <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/ministry/">Ministry</a> and some of those guys."</p>

      <h3>A Compete Guide to Motley Crue Lineup Changes</h3>

      <h4>1981-1992: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil</h4>
      <p>Motley Crue played their first show on April 24, 1981, opening for Y&amp;T at Hollywood's Starwood Hotel. Thanks in part to high-profile gigs as Ozzy Osbourne's opening act and at the US Festival, the often controversial group quickly rose to the top of the hard-rock landscape. Their sophomore album, 'Shout at the Devil,' cracked the Top 20 in 1983, and three more multi-platinum efforts followed before the close of the decade. In the fall of 1991 they signed a lucrative new record contract reportedly worth as much as $35 million. But personality conflicts and a difference of opinion about the band's musical direction led to singer Vince Neil's ouster in February 1992.</p>

      <h4>1992-1996: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, John Corabi</h4>
      <p>A year after Neil made a respectable start to his solo career with the Steve Stevens-powered 'Exposed' album, Motley Crue emerged with new singer John Corabi and a heavier, more serious sound. The new lineup's self-titled 1994 LP didn't connect well with most of the band's earlier audience, though it has since obtained a cult-favorite status among fans. The accompanying tour was poorly attended, and partway through the creation of a follow-up record, Corabi -- frustrated by what he deemed a dizzying series of changing creative directions -- parted ways with the band.</p>

      <h4>1996-1999: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil</h4>
      <p>With Motley Crue's commercial fortunes in free fall, and Neil's sophomore album 'Carved in Stone' failing to crack the Top 100, the original foursome decided to reunite and complete the already in-progress 'Generation Swine' record. In retrospect, they probably would have been better starting fresh, as the final result was a muddled mess of material that was ill-suited to his vocal style. The following Motley Crue vs. the Earth tour was better received, and everything seemed to be back on track.</p>

      <h4>1999-2002: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Vince Neil, Randy Castillo</h4>
      <p>Turns out the original lineup's second stint didn't last very long. Lee had grown eager to explore other forms of music. "I always told myself that when my heart wasn't in it, it was time to quit," he explained in the band's official autobiography 'The Dirt.' "And my heart wasn't in it." When he left to form the band Methods of Mayhem, Motley Crue replaced him with former Ozzy Osbourne drummer Randy Castillo, with whom they recorded 2000's back-to-basics 'New Tattoo.' A cancer diagnosis soon forced Castillo off the tour in support of the album and claimed his life in March 2002.</p>

      <h4>2000-2002: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Vince Neil, Samantha Maloney</h4>
      <p>With Castillo sidelined for health reasons, Motley Crue enlisted former Hole drummer Samantha Maloney to play drums on the band's 'New Tattoo' tour. "The entire band was very supportive and respectful of me. I had the time of my life!," she told NRK. "Some of the fans at first were hesitant, but I won each and every fan over every night after song one." Maloney can be seen and heard on 2001's 'Lewd, Crued &amp; Tattooed' concert video, and would go on to work with Eagles of Death Metal and Peaches.</p>

      <h4>2004-2015: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil</h4>
      <p>After a two-year hiatus, Motley Crue's original lineup reunited for the second time in 2004. "The only thing people ask us about is if we're getting along. Of course we get along," Lee told 'The Guardian,' addressing the band's previous public squabbles. "Time heals -- it's been six years. People change, grow up. I think we all have the attitude now that if we could just fucking get along instead of fucking with each other, we could continue to do this for as long as anybody wants to." Over the next decade, they released one more studio album (2008's 'Saints of Los Angeles'), headlined two editions of the Crue Fest festival and shared co-headlining bills with Aerosmith and Kiss before embarking on a farewell tour that concluded on New Year's Eve 2015.</p>

      <h4>June 2007: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil, Will Hunt</h4>
      <p>When an am injury forced Lee to miss two U.K. show on Motley Crue's 2007 summer tour, he reached out to Evanescence drummer and Crue fan Will Hunt. "I just happened to be in London for four days on a break," Hunt told MusicRadar in 2010. "Tommy called me and said, 'I need you to play tonight!'" Lee rallied enough to play "Kickstart My Heart" at one of the shows.</p>

      <h4>August 2009: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil, Morgan Rose</h4>
      <p>Two years later, another injury -- this time the result of playing with sparklers -- put Lee out of action for a pair of shows on the Crue Fest 2 tour. Sevendust drummer Morgan Rose was there to fill in. Eager to earn his keep, Lee hung around onstage to add backing vocals and play piano on "Home Sweet Home."</p>

      <h4>October 2015: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil, Glen Sobel</h4>
      <p>A tendinitis flareup knocked Lee off the drum stool for a handful of shows on the band's farewell tour. Alice Cooper was opening the entire tour, and his powerhouse drummer Glen Sobel was there to fill in, with Lee performing his by now customary "Home Sweet Home" duties.</p>
