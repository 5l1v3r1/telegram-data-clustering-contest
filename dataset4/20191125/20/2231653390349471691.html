      <h1>Google Ads conversion reporting bug (mostly) fixed</h1>
      <h2>Four reports remain impacted.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:22:18+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://searchengineland.com/author/ginny-marvin" target="_blank">Ginny Marvin</a></address>
      <p>Google Ads engineers have been working to <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ads-overreported-conversions-due-to-bug-working-on-a-fix-325602">fix conversion reporting</a> since a bug caused conversions to be overreported for in the AdWords API, Google Ads API beta and Google Ads scripts.</p>
      <p><b>Status update. </b>As of Sunday, conversion reporting has been fixed except in the Search Query Performance, Geo Performance, Keywordless Query, and Keywordless Category reports, <a href="https://ads-developers.googleblog.com/2019/11/conversion-reporting-issues-for_21.html">Google said</a>.</p>
      <p><b>What was the problem?</b> A bug on November 20 at roughly 9:00 PM EST caused conversion reporting problems between November 11, 12:01 AM PST and November 20, 11:59 AM PST. It affected campaigns that aren’t using last-click attribution.</p>
      <p>The problem only affected reporting, not smart bidding algorithms.</p>
      <p><b>Why we care. </b>If you downloaded conversion field data via the ads APIs or Google Ads scripts between 9:00 PM PST November 20 and 9:00 AM PST November 24 and aren’t using last-click attribution, you should pull that data again to be sure it’s accurate. Continue to hold off on pulling data from the still-affected reports noted above until they’re confirmed fixed.</p>
