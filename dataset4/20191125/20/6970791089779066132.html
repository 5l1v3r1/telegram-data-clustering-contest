      <p>1 – The Original Buddha Board</p>
      <p>There’s too much stress in the world – whether it’s this time of year shopping in-person and online or having to deal with school and work. The Original Buddha Board is large enough to lose yourself in the art world. Easy to travel with, environmentally-friendly and the best way to take your mind off any frustrations.</p>

      <blockquote>Buddha Board is inspired by the Zen idea of living in the moment.  You simply paint on the surface with water and your creation will come to life in bold design.  Then, as the water slowly evaporates, your art will magically disappear leaving you with a clean slate and a clear mind, ready to create a whole new masterpiece. <br/>Buddha Board is environmentally friendly as it only uses water – no ink, no paint, no chemicals – and it will last for years with proper care.<br/> Master the art of letting go…live for the moment and enjoy!  <b>USD</b> $34.95</blockquote>
      <p>2 – The Enso</p>
      <p>Not as large as the Original Buddha Board, the Enso is large enough to still have your artwork on full display in your living room. Create bold designs, doodle random faces and everything in-between.</p>

      <blockquote>ENSO INFINITE ART gently encourages you to value the here-and-now. Simply paint on the surface with water and your creation will come to life in bold design. Then, as the water slowly evaporates, your art will magically disappear allowing you to create a whole new masterpiece.<br/>Enso (en-so) comes from Japanese word ‘circle’ and is a simple, single brush-stroke that represents infinity and the flow of life. It is an artistic ‘expression of the moment’.<br/>Enso is environmentally friendly as it only uses water – no ink, no paint, no chemicals – and it will last for years with proper care.<br/>Dimensions: 12” x 9.5” x 1/4”<br/><b>USD $ 24.95</b></blockquote>
      <p>3 – The Mini Buddha Board (Black)</p>
      <p>If you’re big into the all-black everything, look no further than the Mini Buddha Board. This is small enough to tuck into your book bag and purse and makes a perfect present for family members and bae.</p>

      <p>4 – The Mini Buddha Board (White)</p>
