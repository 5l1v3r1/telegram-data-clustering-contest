      <h1>Google Pixel 4 XL one month later: Is it worth $699?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:12:09+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/nexusben1/" target="_blank">Ben Schoon</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/21/pixel-4-review-roundup/">Reviews of Google’s Pixel 4 series</a> weren’t all that hot thanks to bad battery life and uncompetitive pricing. Now, a month later, we’ve had a chance to use the Pixel 4 XL for an extended period of time and we can better share our experience with the device and answer an important question – is the Pixel 4 XL worth its <a href="https://9to5toys.com/guides/black-friday-2019/">Black Friday</a> price?</p>
      <h3>A month later, how has the Pixel 4 XL fared?</h3>
      <p>I’ve been using Google’s Pixel 4 XL for just about a month at this point and so far, I think it might be my favorite Pixel to date. Why?</p>
      <p>First and foremost there’s the performance. In day to day use the Pixel 4 XL feels faster and consistently more stable than my Pixel 3 ever felt. This includes the camera which, on the Pixel 3, had a ton of issues ranging from lag to not actually saving photos. That’s not a problem I’ve experienced even once on the 4 XL and the speed of taking shots is still snappy too. The experience basically still feels the same as I described <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/31/google-pixel-4-review/">in my full review</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>The upgrade to a Snapdragon 855 and 6GB of RAM from the Pixel 3 has made a dramatic difference in terms of performance.<br/>It’s hard to put into words just how fast this phone is, but even after using technically more powerful phones <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/07/02/oneplus-7-pro-second-opinion/">from OnePlus</a> and Samsung, I can still say that I think the Pixel 4 is the fastest Android smartphone I’ve ever used and I feel there’s not much more that needs to be said.</blockquote>
      <p>Beyond the performance, the software is getting better too. Google recently rolled out an update that makes the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/05/pixel-4-90hz-update-test/">90Hz refresh rate kick in far more often</a> and also <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/11/pixel-4-camera-colors-mistake/">fixing some minor issues</a> with the camera too. It’s taking some time, but apps are also slowly being updated with support for Pixel’s new face unlock too. LastPass, for instance, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/23/pixel-4-lastpass-face-unlock/">added support not long ago</a>. Now <a href="https://twitter.com/NexusBen/status/1196091797468041216">PayPal, please</a>…</p>
      <p>So far, the Pixel 4 XL feels off to a better start than the Pixel 3 before it. By the end, those phones felt faster and had fixed many of their major flaws. Pixel 4 doesn’t have nearly as far to go to fix <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/20/pixel-4-face-unlock-eyes/">its handful of issues</a>.</p>

      <h3>Is it worth $699?</h3>
      <p>The Pixel 4 XL has always been the better of the two phones Google’s released this year largely thanks to its better battery life. A month later, that holds up. <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/31/google-pixel-4-review/">While using the smaller Pixel 4</a>, my usage would kill the device by 7 pm every single night. With the larger model, I’m consistently making it through a full day with around 10-15% remaining at the end of the day. This mirrors what Damien experienced <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/31/google-pixel-4-xl-review/">when he reviewed the Pixel 4 XL</a> a month ago.</p>
      <p>What about the rest of the package? The Pixel 4 XL was largely criticized because of its value. The phone isn’t as spec-heavy as other Android flagships with limited storage options and less RAM too. On top of that, the cameras, while <i>excellent</i>, lack the popular ultra-wide lens and video <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/21/pixel-4-60fps-video/">options like 4K at 60fps</a>.</p>
      <p>At $899 and up, it’s admittedly pretty hard to recommend a Pixel 4 XL if factors like those are at all important, but that price also puts Google’s phone under a lot more scrutiny.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>However, at $699, much of that becomes a lot more forgivable. $699 is well below the cost of competing smartphones like the Galaxy Note 10 and iPhone 11 Pro. Unless you absolutely need those features, the Pixel’s savings of $300 or more is simply compelling. Of course, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/09/26/oneplus-7t-review/">there’s the still-cheaper OnePlus 7T</a>, but fewer buying options <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/22/oneplus-security-notification-breach/">and other concerns</a> may rule that device out for many people.</p>
      <p>It may sound like a cliche, but there’s something about the Pixel experience that makes Google’s smartphones compelling. As I stated in my review:</p>
      <blockquote>Right now, it’s hard for me to say that there’s a better Android phone than the Pixel 4 when it comes to the daily software experience of actually using it.<br/>I’ll be moving over to the Pixel 4 XL for its better battery life just because I value this experience over what other devices offer. Sure, the resale value next year is going to hurt, but if you’re buying a phone to use for a long time – which most people are – and want the best Android experience you can get, you shouldn’t look any further than the Pixel 4 series.</blockquote>

      <h3>Pixel 4 Black Friday Pricing</h3>
      <p>For <a href="https://9to5toys.com/guides/black-friday-2019/">Black Friday</a>, Google is offering a full $200 off all Pixel 4 models. Starting at $599, the entire series becomes a whole lot more compelling. I’ve already recommended a couple of my friends who were interested to go ahead and take advantage of the deal and you should too. For $599 or $699, the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are some really great smartphones.</p>
      <p>If you’re interested in getting a Pixel 4 with the Black Friday pricing, you can purchase from <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_4">the Google Store</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2qLyOfJ">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bhpho.to/2pogDvF">B&amp;H Photo</a>, and other retailers. For all the best deals on Black Friday, keep it locked to our colleagues <a href="https://9to5toys.com/guides/black-friday-2019/">at 9to5Toys which provide <i>the best</i> coverage</a> you’ll find.</p>
