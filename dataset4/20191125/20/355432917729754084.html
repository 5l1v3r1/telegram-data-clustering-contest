      <h1>Prosecutors issue subpoenas for information on Giuliani's consulting work: report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:35:45+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/zack-budryk" target="_blank">Zack Budryk</a></address>
      <p>Prosecutors have issued subpoenas to figures with ties to <a href="https://thehill.com/people/rudy-giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a>, <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a>’s personal lawyer, seeking information on his consulting firm Giuliani Partners, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-subpoenas-seek-information-on-giulianis-consulting-business-11574712722?mod=breakingnews">according to The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
      <p>The subpoenas also seek information on a company co-founded by Lev Parnas, a recently-arrested associate of Giuliani’s, that paid Giuliani for legal and business advice, the Journal reported on Monday.</p>
      <p>The subpoenas, as described by the newspaper, listed numerous potential charges under consideration including obstruction of justice, conspiracy to defraud the United States, making false statements to the federal government and money laundering.</p>
      <p>They also seek materials relating to pro-Trump groups America First Action and America First Policies. Kelly Sadler, a spokeswoman for the groups, said they have reached out to the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office and offered their cooperation, and said neither was issued a subpoena.</p>
      <p>Giuliani told the Journal he had not been contacted by federal investigators.</p>
      <p>“All they have to do is come and ask me,” he told the newspaper. “There’s obviously a concerted effort to spread as many lies about me as possible, to destroy my reputation so that I’m not credible when I continue to reveal all of the massive evidence of criminality by the Bidens,” he said.</p>
      <p>Parnas and another Giuliani associate, Igor Fruman, reportedly aided Giuliani in his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a>. Fruman and Parnas were arrested in October and charged with campaign finance violations. They have both pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>Parnas asked at least two recipients of subpoenas to invest in his fraud insurance firm, Fraud Guarantee, according to the Journal.</p>
      <p>One of the two declined to give any money, but another invested an unspecified amount when Parnas described a plan to obtain a $20 million federal grant, according to the Journal, citing one of the businessman’s associates.</p>
      <p>“I had no knowledge of a grant, and it seemed to me they were at a premature position to be looking for a grant,” Giuliani told the newspaper.</p>
      <p>Some of the subpoenas also sought materials pertaining to David Correia, the co-founder of Fraud Guarantee, who was charged in the same October indictment. He has pleaded not guilty.</p>
