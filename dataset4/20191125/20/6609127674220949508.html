      <p>But they were nearly forced to pull the plug on Saturday's set at the Manchester Arena because of a can of Tennent's Lager.</p>
      <p>John - who has penned hits for Westlife and Busted - revealed: "I nearly missed the show because I got locked in the back of the Splitter van.</p>
      <p>"I'd gone to get a can of Tennent's out the back and the next I thing I know the door has closed behind me and I'm locked in.</p>
      <p>"It was only 20 minutes before we were due on stage and it was pitch black so I was in a bit of a panic."</p>
      <p>John was rescued by Simple Minds guitarist Gordy Goudie who had been sent to find his AWOL Faithful bandmate.</p>
      <p>John added: "Rod was laughing his head off when he heard what had happened. He just said to me, 'I'm glad you got out in time wee man' - so am I as the show was mega!"</p>
      <p>John will support Rod at his three gigs in Glasgow this week with the legendary rocker playing at the SSE Hydro tomorrow, Thursday and Saturday.</p>
      <p>And the Hoops-daft frontman told fans they may get a blast of his Celtic Christmas charity single Star of Glasgow's Green and White.</p>
      <p>He said: "The club has released it as a single for the Celtic Foundation so hopefully we will make loads of money for charity.</p>
      <p>"I'm sure the Celtic fans in the audience will want to hear it and even if the Rangers supporters are not so keen it might help them get in the Christmas spirit - or maybe they will wish I was still stuck in the back of that van."</p>
      <p>Tickets for Rod Stewart at the Hydro are available from <a href="http://ticketmaster.co.uk/">ticketmaster.co.uk</a>.</p>
      <p>Johnny Mac and the Faithful play St Luke's in Glasgow on March 5.</p>
