      <h1>‘I’m A Nazi Girl, in a Nazi World’ Sings Student in Music Video Project in Argentina</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:33:04+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/hlj/" target="_blank">Hana Levi Julian</a></address>
      <p>“I’m a Nazi girl, in a Nazi world . . . “ Picture a cute teenage girl singing the song, a parody of the song “Barbie Girl” by Aqua, in a music video with Nazi symbols, and singing Nazis humiliating more students dressed up as Jews and homosexuals.</p>

      <p>Sounds a little odd, right? Like a 1939 throwback? Except that it made the rounds on social media, went viral in fact.</p>
      <p>This history class project was assigned to students in northwest Argentina at the private secondary school, Escuela Modelo of San Juan – the “Model School” in the province of San Juan – which assures the reader on its website that they “mold people with integrity, solidarity and entrepreneurship.”</p>
      <p>The students were given <i>nine points out of ten</i> by the teacher — who was reportedly laid off (some media reported the teacher was “sanctioned and fired”) — for their project.</p>
      <p>A national anti-discrimination law has been on the books in Argentina since 1998, but it seems the teacher of this class didn’t get the memo. The video nevertheless continues to circulate, of course, and naturally the damage is done.</p>
      <p>A representative of the country’s national Jewish DAIA political organization was scheduled to meet with San Juan Education Ministry officials about the video.</p>
      <p>In advance of the meeting, on Saturday, the school released a statement expressing its “apologies to the representative of the Sociedad Israelita de San Juan,” (JCC) and other organizations equally affronted by the incident, including homosexuals and people of color.</p>
      <p>The apology didn’t change squat in the minds of teens who will forever remember their moment in the spotlight having fun ridiculing the agony of people they never even knew.</p>
