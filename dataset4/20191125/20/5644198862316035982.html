      <p>Apple Inc and semiconductor stocks powered the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes to record highs on Monday, after a report signaled that the United States and China were nearing a trade truce, with sentiment also buoyed by a raft of mega deals.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes climbed to new record highs on Monday as signs indicated the United States and China were moving closer to a trade truce, while a host of merger deals also helped buoy sentiment.</p>
      <p>A Chinese state-backed tabloid said Beijing and Washington were "very close" to an initial pact, and lifted trade-sensitive semiconductor stocks, including Applied Materials Inc , up 3.98per cent and Lam Research Corp , which gained 2.42per cent. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index jumped 2.32per cent and was on pace for its best day in just over three weeks.</p>

      <p>Nvidia Corp rose 4.59per cent and paced the gains on the chip index as Morgan Stanley upgraded its shares to "overweight" from "equal weight".</p>
      <p>The report came on the heels of comments over the weekend by a top U.S. official that an agreement was still possible by the end of the year, dampening worries the negotiations could spill over into 2020.</p>
      <p>"Any optimism on the trade front is always welcome," said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully what is taking place is a signal that without a derailment coming into the end of the year, from a trade perspective, everything else seems to be somewhat intact and you can tack on incremental positives, whether it is M&amp;A, or macroeconomic data."</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 142.01 points, or 0.51per cent, to 28,017.63, the S&amp;P 500 gained 19.52 points, or 0.63per cent, to 3,129.81 and the Nasdaq Composite added 104.78 points, or 1.23per cent, to 8,624.66.</p>
      <p>Apple Inc rose 1.18per cent as the top boost to the S&amp;P and Nasdaq and the second-biggest lift to the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p>
      <p>Gains on Monday were broad with only the defensive consumer staples and utilities S&amp;P sectors in the red. Tech gains helped push the Nasdaq up by more than 1 percent, with the group on pace for its best day since Nov. 1.</p>
      <p>Tiffany &amp; Co jumped 6.29per cent and was the biggest gainer on the S&amp;P 500 as the luxury jeweler agreed to a sweetened US$16.2 billion deal to be acquired by France's LVMH .</p>
      <p>U.S. discount brokerage TD Ameritrade Holding Corp was up 6.03per cent after larger rival Charles Schwab Corp said it would buy the company in an all-stock deal valued at about US$26 billion. Schwab rose 1.19per cent.</p>
      <p>EBay Inc gained 2.05per cent after the e-commerce major said it would sell ticketing unit StubHub to ticket reseller Viagogo for US$4.05 billion in cash.</p>
      <p>Major averages on Wall Street have reached a series of new highs recently on hopes for progress of a trade deal and third-quarter corporate earnings came in better than lowered expectations.</p>
      <p>Failing to participate in the advance, Uber Technologies slipped 1.44per cent as the ride-hailing company was stripped of its license to carry paying passengers in London for the second time in just over two years.</p>
      <p>Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.96-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.17-to-1 ratio favored advancers.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 posted 35 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 119 new highs and 51 new lows.</p>
