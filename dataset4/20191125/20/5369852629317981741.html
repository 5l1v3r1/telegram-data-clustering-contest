      <p>WATERFORD HURLER AUSTIN Gleeson believes ex-Brighton footballer, and current Ballygunner star, Dessie Hutchinson could prove to be a “massive player” for the Déise in 2020.</p>

      <p>Hutchinson played an instrumental role for Ballygunner in 2019 as they collected a sixth consecutive county title on the way back to another Munster club SHC final.</p>
      <p>The reigning provincial champions put their crown on the line against Tipperary’s Borris-Ileigh over the weekend where Hutchinson’s three points from play wasn’t enough to prevent his side <a href="https://www.the42.ie/borris-ileigh-ballygunner-munster-club-shc-final-4904755-Nov2019/">from being dethroned.</a></p>
      <p>Hutchinson represented the Waterford footballers earlier this year in their Munster SFC quarter-final against Clare, having previously been released from Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in 2018. </p>
      <p>The Waterford hurlers have reconvened for their pre-season preparations and Gleeson reckons that Hutchinson could be in line for a more permanent position in the panel as the new season draws near.</p>
      <p>He even sees glimpses of a former Waterford legend in the Ballygunner man’s game.</p>
      <p>“He’s in on the set up,” Gleeson begins.</p>
      <blockquote>There’s 43 or 44. There’s no definite panel. You could see how he’d fit in for us. He’s the type of forward we’ve been missing the last few years. He’s a [John] Mullane type of figure, I suppose, the way his feet are and he’s two-sided.</blockquote>
      <p>“I have a feeling he could be a massive player for us.”</p>
      <p>Remembering Hutchinson in his earlier years, Gleeson continues:</p>
      <p>“He’s a year younger than me. I remember him playing Tony Forristal and was doing stuff at 14. He was doing stuff that a 14-year-old shouldn’t be able to do. He was playing corner-forward back then.</p>
      <p>“Himself and Patrick Curran were in full-forward. I think the first year they ever won the Tony Forristal was his year and himself and Patrick were the two main players.”</p>

      <p>The 2019 championship brought another raft of disappointments for the Waterford hurlers. They finished the Munster SHC round-robin series with a clean sweep of defeats, which saw them crash out of the championship at the provincial stage for the second year-in-a-row.</p>
      <p>Paraic Fanning subsequently stepped down as Waterford manager after just one season in charge, and has since been replaced by Tipperary native Liam Cahill.</p>
      <p>For Gleeson, the early exit offered him a chance to leave Waterford and Ireland behind for a while and sample a different lifestyle in New York. </p>
      <p>“Once I got the call I said ‘yeah,’” says the Mount Sion man who was invited to come to the States by some of his friends from college.</p>
      <blockquote>It was straight away. I needed to get out of here and escape for myself. Over the last few years, it was something I needed to do. I didn’t have a clue what was going on here. I remember I visited my uncle in Chicago and my Grandmother was giving out saying that I never even contacted.</blockquote>
      <p>“I just totally escaped Ireland for eight weeks. It was possibly one of the best things that could have happened to me. I came back a totally different person, getting away from all that negative vibes around.</p>
      <p>“It’s a totally different world. No-one says anything to you. You can literally finish work, go for a drink or two with the lads, go home go to bed and get up the next morning.</p>
      <p>“That’s it, there’s nothing said. If you do that in Ireland [people say], ‘that lad was in and he was falling round the place.’ It’s a totally different world and it was an unreal few weeks.”</p>

      <p>Gleeson was famously crowned the Young Hurler of the Year and Hurler of the Year in 2016. It was a unique double-achievement that placed him under an intense spotlight, but it came at a price as expectations around his potential soared.</p>

      <p>The subsequent years were less enjoyable for him due to the increased demands, but as he approaches his 25th birthday in 2020, he feels he has matured.</p>
      <p>His trip to New York certainly helped him get through that growing-up process.</p>
      <p>“I was in college in Waterford, I never really went outside Waterford or anything. It’s really after opening my eyes and seeing that there’s a whole other world outside Waterford.</p>
      <p>“Even in the off-season, thinking about going away for a few weeks doing South East Asia and all those places. You see people going and thinking ‘I’d love to do it,’ but I wouldn’t actually. It’s something you always want to do now.”</p>
