      <p>A Dublin model has devoted herself to campaigning on behalf of victims of domestic abuse after the tragic death of her aunt.</p>
      <p>Monica Walsh, who has represented Ireland in international beauty pageants Miss World and Miss Universe, said domestic violence is still a “taboo subject”. </p>
      <p>“I was just 13 or 14 when my aunt and godmother passed away,” she told RSVP Live. </p>
      <p>“I remember her mother knocking on the door and telling us she had died - I asked what happened and nobody wanted to talk about it. </p>
      <p>“I only found out years later that she had been a victim of domestic violence. She was only 36, she had two kids.”</p>
      <p>She said that after she found out what happened to her aunt, she realised she hadn’t picked up on the signs she was being abused. </p>
      <p>“Everything came back to me,” she said. </p>
      <p>“I remember her wearing sunglasses to hide a bruise on her eye. </p>
      <p>“Nobody helped her. If she or someone else had acted sooner she could still be alive and safe.”</p>

      <p>Monica, who is originally from Poland, learnt more about domestic violence when she was competing in Miss Universe.</p>
      <p>“I was representing Ireland in Belarus and each of the contestants had to prepare a speech about domestic violence,” she said.</p>

      <p>“I started researching the topic, I went to a conference and heard stories from all around the world. </p>
      <p>“I realised this is a huge problem globally.” </p>
      <p>The mum of one is now writing a book called Get Me Out Of This Hell, comprising stories from three different survivors of domestic violence.</p>

      <p>“They don’t want to talk about it with their friends, they want to give out the impression that they have a perfect happy family,” she went on. </p>
      <p>“It’s especially hard for migrants who don’t have their family and friends around them for support.</p>

      <p>“I met up with one woman in Dublin, she was so afraid of her husband that we had to meet in her car.</p>
      <p>“If I can save even one life, then my work will be worth it.” </p>
      <p>She added: “If you’re a victim of abuse, remember that it’s not your fault. </p>
      <p>“You deserve to feel safe in your own home.</p>
      <p>“Reach out for help - whether it’s Women’s Aid or another organisation. You are not alone."</p>
