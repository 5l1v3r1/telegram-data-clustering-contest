      <h1>ESPN Analyst Releases Score Prediction For Oklahoma-OSU</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:15:30+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Oklahoma’s College Football Playoff hopes got a boost on Saturday with Oregon’s loss to Arizona State. Now, the Sooners must beat a dangerous Oklahoma State team on Saturday to keep those playoff aspirations alive.</p>
      <p>QB Jalen Hurts is as exciting of a offensive player as their is in college football. But Oklahoma’s defense has seemingly regressed after early season success. The Sooners will have to be sharp against an explosive OSU offense led by RB Chuba Hubbard.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys’ dynamic RB is on pace for a 2,000 yard season. Hubbard has 1,832 yards and 20 touchdowns through 11 games. He’s certainly deserving of Heisman hype, but his team’s 8-3 record has hurt his odds.</p>
      <p>Will Oklahoma’s defense slow down the explosive OSU offense? Or will Hubbard and the Cowboys shock the college football world?</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Bill Connelly has released his <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28156003/everything-need-know-college-football-rivalry-week">score prediction</a> for the massive Big 12 contest. His SP+ formula is predicting a big time Sooners’ victory.</p>
      <blockquote><b>SP+ projection:</b> Oklahoma 40, Oklahoma State 27</blockquote>
      <p>A 13-point victory would be a notable feat for Oklahoma – and it might be a major bragging point to the CFP committee. Right now, Alabama and Utah are the two teams primarily in the discussion for the potential No. 4 seed.</p>
      <p>But Oklahoma has an impressive resume and will have a strong argument for getting in as long as they win on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma-Oklahoma State kicks off this Saturday at 8 p.m. ET on FOX.</p>
