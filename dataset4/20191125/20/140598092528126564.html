      <h1>Seats where tactical voting could secure Remain win cut by nearly a third, polls show as Tories extend lead</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:17:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/charles-hymas/" target="_blank">Charles Hymas</a></address>
      <p>The number of seats where tactical voting could win the seat for Remainers has fallen by nearly a third in a month, as a monthly poll of polls gives Boris Johnson’s Tories their biggest lead since 2017.</p>
      <p>The analysis shows that since November 10, the number of marginal seats where tactical voting could be decisive in defeating the Conservative candidate has fallen from 68 to 49.</p>
      <p>This is where Labour, Liberal Democrat or Green Party voters switched allegiance to back whichever was the Remain candidate most likely to defeat the Conservative’s Brexit-backing candidate.</p>
      <p>The decline in target tactical voting seats, revealed by the Remain United website, follows the withdrawal of Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party from fighting Tory-held constituencies which has seen their votes switch virtually en masse to the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>It comes as the monthly November poll of polls by Electoral Calculus shows Tories with the same 13 per cent lead over Labour as Theresa May had at the same point in the 2017 campaign with two and a half weeks to go until election day.</p>
      <p>Her bungled manifesto launch at the same point, however, saw her support collapse to just two per cent on the eve of polling day, costing her the majority she had inherited from David Cameron.</p>
      <p>November is the best month the Tories have had in the montly poll of polls since June 2017, with the Conservatives on 43 per cent, Labour on 29.9 per cent, Liberal Democrats on 15.1 per centand Brexit on 3.4 per cent. </p>
      <p>This would put the Conservatives on 365 seats, Labour on 202, the LibDems on 20 and the Brexit Party with none. It would mean a majority of 80 for Mr Johnson.</p>
      <p>Martin Baxter, founder of Electoral Calculus, said current volatility was within the “tribes” with Leavers switching from the Brexit Party to Tories, and Remainers coalescing to Labour, squeezing the Liberal Democrats. “The election will be won by the party that is best able to unify its support base,” he said.</p>
      <p>Remain United founder, Gina Miller, the businesswoman who led two successful legal challenges against the Government on Brexit, said talk of a big majority for Mr Johnson was premature. Her tactical voting website urged supporters to “intensify activity” in the remaining 49 marginal seats.</p>
