      <p>Square Enix details more changes coming to the Final Fantasy 7 Remake.</p>
      <p>The upcoming remake of Final Fantasy 7 will have include a number of new characters and boss battles, game director Tetsuya Nomura confirmed in a blog post today.</p>
      <p>“With regard to new characters,” Nomura said in the<a href="https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-developers"> post</a> on the official Square Enix blog, “of whom I said during past interviews that there would be ‘none’ – though they aren’t main characters, their numbers ended up growing considerably in the process of creating a rich depiction of Midgar. When you think of Midgar’s final boss, you probably think of the M.O.T.O.R., but in this game new bosses will appear and add to the excitement of the story even more.”</p>
      <p>Square Enix also confirmed that the Final Fantasy 7 Remake will be released in multiple parts. The first of which is entirely set within Midgar, and the developer is already working on the second.</p>
      <p>“We’ve already begun working on the next one as well,” the director continues, “but I’m confident that playing through this title will expand your expectations just like the world that extends beyond Midgar.”</p>
