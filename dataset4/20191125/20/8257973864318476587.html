      <p>Nov. 25 (UPI) -- A baby fur seal that wandered into a California parking deck caught a lift to the local fire station, where it settled in for a nap.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5Qwm2hBWT8/?utm_source=ig_embed">Redwood City Fire Department said</a> the baby seal, dubbed Santos, was found by a resident Sunday in a paring deck in Redwood City.</p>
      <p>Firefighters brought the small creature back to the fire station, where the creature settled in for a nap before being picked up by experts from The Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/24/us/baby-seal-parking-deck-rescue-trnd/index.html">spokesman for the center said</a> it is unusual for northern fur seals to wander on land, as the species spends most of its time in the open ocean.</p>
      <p>The seal is now being cared for at the center and might eventually be released back into the wild, officials said.</p>
