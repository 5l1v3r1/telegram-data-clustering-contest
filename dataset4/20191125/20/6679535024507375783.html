      <p>The parents of three-month-old Prince Rajbhar, who died after being injured in a fire at KEM Hospital, performed his last rites in Bhoiwada on Monday evening.</p>
      <p>They were handed over a compensation of ₹10 lakh by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.</p>
      <p>“I still don’t know what I am going to do with the money. We have lost such a small child. In all that was happening, we haven’t even grieved for him properly,” his father Pannelal said.</p>
      <p>Prince was admitted to the hospital for a heart defect on November 5. On November 7, when an ECG cable attached to a multi-parameter monitor caught fire in the paediatric intensive care unit, the baby suffered burns on his left arm, shoulder, and scalp.</p>
      <p>Doctors had to amputate his arm to prevent infection. But he eventually succumbed to a septicemia shock following thermal burns on November 22.</p>
      <p>His parents now plan to head back to their home in Mau district of Uttar Pradesh. Mr. Rajbhar who had applied for a polytechnical course has to appear for the examinations from December 7. “I was studying so that I could give a better life to my wife and child. I will continue with that thought.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Rajbhar worked in a firm in Delhi but he lost his job due to prolonged leave that he had taken for Prince’s treatment. “After my exams, I will go back to Delhi to meet my employer. There is another job offer I have. I will go for that interview as well.”</p>
