      <p>Smith sacking the quarterback isn’t anything unusual. He has 10.5 sacks on the season, but what he did after was what captured attention of football fans across America.</p>

      <p>Following his sack, Smith lifted up his jersey and had a shirt underneath that said, "We love Eileen."</p>
      <p>Eileen is the mom of one of the Packers’ equipment managers who is currently battling cancer.</p>
      <p>Smith promised him that he would flash the shirt if he got a sack, and he kept that promise.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/sports/packers/packers-lose-to-49ers-37-8/1145210732">Packers were defeated</a> by the San Francisco 49ers and fell to 8-3 on the season.</p>
      <p>They take on the New York Giants on Sunday at noon.</p>
