      <h1>Westpac bows to the inevitable</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:28:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/author/david/" target="_blank">Houses and Holes</a></address>
      <p>I was mid incredulous post when the news came <a href="https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/westpac-ceo-resigns-asx-set-to-rise-20191125-p53e01">through</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Westpac’s chief executive Brian Hartzer will step down from Monday, with chairman Lindsay Maxsted to bring forward his retirement to the first half of 2020.<br/><br/>Additionally, non-executive director Ewen Crouch will not seek re-election at the upcoming annual general meeting.<br/><br/>The current chief financial officer Peter King will step in as acting CEO.</blockquote>
      <p>There was no other way. Judging by yesterday’s media about Westpac resistence, I wonder if the Government stepped in.</p>
