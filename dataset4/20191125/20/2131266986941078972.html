      <p>Marie Kondo's latest business venture has left several fans questioning whether her motives are about tidying - or making money.</p>
      <p>The self-confessed lover of transforming mess has built an empire around tidying up: emptying closets and drawers and keeping those that "spark joy" in their rightful place.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the launch of her online shop, 'KonMari' on 18 November, Facebook fans questioned whether they should fill their de-cluttered homes with more items - and their ability to afford them.</p>

      </p>
      <p>With prices to the tune of US$35 (NZ$54.63) for a candle holder, US$50 ($NZ78.04) for a tuning fork and US$200 (NZ$312.14) for a handcrafted tea container made from Japanese elm, the lightness they bring may also be reflected in a lighter back pocket.</p>
      <p>"I love what you do, but unfortunately your products are incredibly expensive.  They would not spark joy for my bank account," Stimpson said, generating 'likes' from 54 others.</p>
      <p>Detailed product information can be found on the associated page, confirming that many products are naturally-sourced and support minimal-waste.  Some utilise natives, such as the 'crumb brush' which is made from bark sourced from the windmill palm in Wakayama, while others, such as the 'cement live edge bowl, are handcrafted.  </p>
      <p>"If I could afford to buy any of those items, I would indeed be full of joy," Jensen said.</p>
      <p>In an online statement, Kondo said that her tidying method isn't about getting rid of things -  it's about "heightening your sensitivity to what brings you joy."  </p>
      <p>The online shop is a collection of Marie's favourite things and items that spark joy for her.</p>
      <p>Responding to Facebook comments on price, a spokesperson for the KonMari shop said the price-range is wide and customer feedback is invited in view of extending the range.  </p>
      <p>"Our goal is to offer a range of lifestyle items across different categories and price points (US$8 to US$275).</p>
      <p>"Each item was carefully selected with consideration for its materials and craftsmanship, and is intended to be cherished and used for years to come."</p>
      <p>"We're all ears and would love to hear what shop items might spark joy for you (because that sparks joy for us)," the shop's comments read.</p>
      <p>The feedback wasn't all bad, as some comments reflected an understanding that Kondo's method is about people owning things they really love.</p>
      <p>"Perhaps for you, saving money over buying material goods sparks joy," Johns said.</p>
      <p>"I'd be disappointed in her shop had she simply shared a bunch of more commonplace, less expensive items that she doesn't actually use or love."</p>
      <p>While so far, Kondo's shop is generating a mixed reaction from fans, given the 'Shiatsu Stick', (a camellia wood pressure point stick used for reflexology purposes), is currently out of stock, at US$12 (NZ$18.73), it seems there's something for everyone.</p>
      <p>Affordable or not, fans who don't support Kondo's online prices are well-advised to stick to her method by continuing to do what sparks joy for them. </p>
