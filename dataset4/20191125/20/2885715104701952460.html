      <h1>Delhi court pulls up CBI for delays in 1984 riots case</h1>
      <h2>Seeking report, CMM says ‘expect agency to act in a sensitive manner, submit reply within 15 days’.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:45:58+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/anand-mohan-j/" target="_blank">Anand Mohan J</a></address>
      <p>A Delhi court came down heavily on the CBI during proceedings in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case, in which Congress leader Jagdish Tytler is accused, for delay in recording a key witness’s statement.</p>
      <p>Seeking a report from the CBI, Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Harjyot Singh said considering it was a 35-year-old case, it expects the agency to act in a sensitive manner and not take more than 15 days to file a reply.</p>
      <p>The CMM noted that “35 years after the incident in which citizens were burnt alive, investigation agencies have tried to show that they will show justice to the victims… conduct of the agencies, in my view speaks otherwise”. He said his predecessor had ordered CBI to look into allegations of a witness being influenced and to conduct a polygraph test on another witness, Abhishek Verma.</p>
      <p>As per court records, it took the CBI three years to conduct Verma’s polygraph test, and, before his test, Verma claimed he received threats and sought enhancement of police protection. Verma had approached the court to record his statement under CrPC Section 164.</p>
      <p>After perusing previous orders, the CMM pulled up the IO in the case, Vinod Kumar, and said: “I am surprised that the investigating agency does not seem to be concerned that the key witness received a threat right before the polygraph test… I would like to know from the investigating officer that considering the witness, Abhishek Verma, was threatened by the alleged letter in August 2018, while he was already receiving some police protection, is it not possible that other witnesses also feel insecure?”</p>
      <p>The CMM then asked the IO why the agency was satisfied with recording statements under CrPC Section 161, which is neither signed by the witness and is of little evidenciary value, and why he does not want the witnesses to record their statements under CrPC Section 164.</p>
      <p>He then observed that: “In this case, persons were burnt alive in a public place and witnesses have been not been forthcoming… the decision of the investigating agency must reflect fairness to victims and witnesses who are braving to depose against influential persons.”</p>
