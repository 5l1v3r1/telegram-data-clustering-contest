      <p>Crisis rocking the Adamawa chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) took another twist on Monday, November 25, as some aggrieved members of the party formed a splinter group which was named Reformed Peoples Democratic Party (R-PDP).</p>
      <p>The Nation reports that a governorship aspirant in the state, Umar Ardo, who announced the development to newsmen in Yola on Monday, November 25, said the PDP at the state level has been existing on illegality in the last few months.</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng</b> gathered that he said the illegality started when the present state executive committee came to be by merely transforming from the caretaker committee constituted by members who were supposed to have resigned from that committee and contest in duly conducted election.</p>

      </p>
      <p>He said: <i>“The emphasis was that any member of the caretaker committees wishing to contest towards the formation of executive committees must resign, but this was not adhered to in Adamawa state.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“The entire Adamawa caretaker committee, all eleven of them, sat in a hotel in Yola and transmuted themselves into the state exco."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Ardo said he was leading the R-PDP out because all efforts he made before now to get the PDP to make amends failed.</p>
      <p>He said he wrote petitions to both the national and state leaderships of the party but got no relief, adding that similar illegalities were being perpetuated in the countdown to local government election due on December 7, hence the resolve to take decisive action.</p>
      <p>He said a meeting by stakeholders of the new Reformed PDP earlier in the day constituted a 29-member steering committee to outline modalities for establishing executive committees of the R-PDP in Adamawa state among other responsibilities.</p>

      <p>Responding to the allegations on the evening of Monday, November 25, the state chairman of the PDP, Shehu Tahir, said Ardo participated in governorship processes up to the primary election which he lost to eventual governor Ahmadu Fintiri.</p>
      <p><i>“How could Umar Ardo have been contesting under a party exco he is now describing as an illegality,”</i> Tahir asked.</p>
      <p>He added that Ardo had ceased from being member of PDP and could not therefore be in a position now to leave it for a splinter group.</p>
