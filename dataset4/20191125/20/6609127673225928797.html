      <p>The sessions, which will last around half an hour, will give fans the chance to ask him more about his life.</p>
      <p>Lewis has called the event 'Big Fat Sexy Q&amp;A'.</p>
      <p>But it seems some Capaldi lovers are having difficulty getting their hands on tickets - with social media users are reporting problems purchasing them.</p>
      <p>One person tweeted: "I have received my code for the Lewis Capaldi Q&amp;A but it doesn't seem to be working.</p>
      <p>"It's unlocking the tickets but when I go to check out it says there is an error."</p>
      <p>Another said: "Literally had second row tickets for the Q&amp;A, went to pay and then it stopped working great."</p>

      <p>We told you how a <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4939374/glasgow-lewis-capaldi-pizza/">Glasgow pizzeria has paid tribute to Lewis Capaldi</a> in the most barmy way - by putting his face on a pizza.</p>
      <p>Chefs at Shawlands restaurant Oro Italian made the incredible doughy creation as they became the latest to hype up the Scots superstar.</p>
      <p>And they did a job any artist would be proud of, as the final result bears an uncanny resemblance to the singer.</p>
