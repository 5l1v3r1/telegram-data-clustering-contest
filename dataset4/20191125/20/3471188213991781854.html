      <h1>Amazon Australia once again bringing some great deals for Black Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:30:21+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:30</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Plowman</a></address>
      <p>In the last couple of years Australians have jumped on board Black Friday sales in a big way and this year is set to be no different. As is the case with many businesses this year Amazon Australia are not just releasing their deals early but also having some pre-Black Friday sales.</p>
      <p>As they did last year Amazon Australia will be having “new deals, all day, every day”. Not only are they having tech and electronics sales but also toys, books, fashion, household and garden goods, sports gear and so much more — you name it they have it on sale. Of course this is Ausdroid so we are mostly interesting in the tech and electronics deals.</p>
      <p>The interesting thing is that Australians will have early access to the Black Friday Countdown deals direct from the US through the Australian Amazon website from 7pm AEDT Thursday 28 November. Cyber Monday deals will also be included in all this early and late access with Cyber Monday in Australia, from the US site, continuing until 6:59pm AEDT on Tuesday 3 December.</p>
      <p>Notable deals that are relevant to Ausdroid include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Save on select Samsung smartphones</li>
        <li>Save up to 25% on select laptops from Lenovo, ASUS and Acer</li>
        <li>Save on gaming gear from Corsair and Razer</li>
        <li>Save on Bose SoundLink Color Bluetooth Speakers (Cyber Monday)</li>
        <li>Save big on Soniq TVs</li>
        <li>Epic savings across Sony PS4 consoles and games</li>
        <li>Up to 50% off select Thermos products</li>
        <li>Up to 25% Sunbeam kitchen appliances</li>
        <li>Great savings across Amazon Devices including $50 off the Kindle Paperwhite, $20 off Fire TV Stick and large discounts our bestselling Echo devices</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are also deals on Amazon Music, Audible and Books. As part of the sale new Amazon Music Unlimited customers can get four months of the premium streaming tier for just 99 cents!</p>
      <p>Don’t forget that Amazon are still offering free international expedited shipping on all Prime eligible products from the US through Amazon Global Store on amazon.com.au so if you are after something in particular don’t forget to check out the US Amazon store.</p>
      <p>Of course the above deals are only a snippet of what Amazon will be offering on Black Friday and Cyber Monday so keep an eye on Amazon for each hourly deal. We will endeavour to bring you more information on other deals before Friday — expect Amazon and other stores to compete with each other on each product so expect more.</p>
