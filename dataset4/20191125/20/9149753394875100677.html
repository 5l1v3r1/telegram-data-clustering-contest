      <p>The Fortnite week 8 loading screen has leaked a little early, giving us the letter E location to finish up the Alter Ego <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/fortnite-chapter-2-letter-F-location/">F</a>-<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/fortnite-chapter-2-letter-o-location/">O</a>-<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/Fortnite-letter-R-location/">R</a>-T-<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/fortnite-hidden-n-search-loading-screen-the-lowdown/">N</a>-<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/fortnite-letter-I-location/">I</a>-<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/fortnite-hidden-t-letter-location/">T</a>-E challenge.

      <p>Week 8's loading screen features the hydro dam, locatedÂ west of Lazy Lake. Here's the loading screen.</p>

      <p>Check out the light pole on the left side of the dam. You'll find the letter E perched on top of it. All you should need to do is build a ramp up a dozen feet or so and you'll be able to grab it.</p>
      <p>Remember though, you'll need to complete eight of the week 8 mission challenges before you'll be able to grab the letter E. This mission goes live later this week, one assumes Thursday since it's an early leak.</p>
