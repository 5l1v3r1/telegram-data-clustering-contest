      <h1>Davante Adams Issues Message To Fans After Blowout Loss</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:44:38+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>The Packers suffered a shocking blowout loss to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday night. The game was expected to be a close battle with QB Aaron Rodgers trying to out-duel the San Francisco defense. But Rodgers had minimal time to pass as the 49ers’ defensive line got pressure all game long.</p>
      <p>Since the Packers’ Sunday night loss, major concerns are starting to arise. Is Green Bay in serious trouble?</p>
      <p>Packers WR Davante Adams took to Twitter on Monday to reassure fans the team will get better because of the loss.</p>
      <blockquote>“We gotta be better!! And we will,” Adams said on his person Twitter account. “Love my guys thru thick n thin.”</blockquote>

      <p>Sunday night’s loss will be a major wake up call for this Green Bay team. The defeat could be something that helps the Packers in the long run, especially in the post-season.</p>
      <p>Adams certainly will stick by his teammates no matter the adversity that hits.</p>
      <p>The Packers’ WR has been a scoring machine for Green Bay over the past few seasons. He had yet to score a touchdown prior to Sunday night’s game, but managed to get in the end-zone against the 49ers for his first of the season.</p>
      <p>Adams has 46 receptions for 580 yards this year. He’ll look to have a strong finish to the season as the Packers battle it out for a NFC playoff berth.</p>
