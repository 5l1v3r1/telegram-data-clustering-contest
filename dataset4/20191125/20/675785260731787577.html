      <h2>Massimo Cellino racially insulted Mario Balotelli but Brescia have now come out and defended their chairman, insisting he was making a joke</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:24:39+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:24</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Lewis, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-lewis/</a></address>
      <p>Mario Balotelli has been racially insulted by his own chairman at Italian club Brescia.</p>
      <p>Asked why Balotelli had been dropped, ex-Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino said: "What can I say? That he's black and he's working to whiten himself but he has great difficulties in this.”</p>
      <p>The slur is the latest in a string of insults aimed at the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> striker during his time in Italy</p>
      <p>Italian Balotelli was racially abused by Verona supporters earlier this month but was persuaded to stay on the pitch after threatening to walk off.</p>
      <p>Brescia boss Fabio Grosso left Balotelli out of Sunday's squad for the 3-0 defeat at Roma and challenged him to show more "determination and enthusiasm" to regain his place.</p>

      <p>Responding to Cellino's comments regarding Balotelli's situation on Monday, the Serie A club issued a statement defending their position.</p>
      <p>It read: "In relation to what president Massimo Cellino declared this afternoon about our player Mario Balotelli, Brescia Calcio explains that it was clearly a joke said as a paradox.</p>
      <p>"It was clearly misunderstood and it was said in the attempt to downplay an excessive media exposure and aimed at protecting the player."</p>
      <p>Brescia are bottom of Serie A, four points from safety after two wins from their opening 12 matches.</p>
      <p>Balotelli has scored two goals in seven appearances since joining his hometown club in August.</p>

      <p>The Palermo-born marksman has suffered racist abuse in Italy playing for Inter Milan and AC Milan over the past ten years.</p>
      <p>In 2012 the Italian daily newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport were forced to apologise after publishing a cartoon depicting Balotelli, then playing for Italy at the European Championships, as King Kong on top of Big Ben.</p>
      <p>The image, on the day of Italy’s game against England, led to a number of complaints from readers.</p>
      <p>Earlier this season Balotelli was dismissed as “arrogant” by Brescia's ultras group following his reaction to racist abuse from Verona supporters.</p>
      <p>Verona were handed a one-match partial stadium closure and the club banned one of their ultras, Luca Castellini, for more than 10 years after he said Balotelli could "never be completely Italian”.</p>
