      <p><b>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (WMC/WVLT) --</b> A Tennessee woman was accused of killing her grandmother's dog and leaving its body parts around her house, WMC <a href="https://www.wmcactionnews5.com/2019/11/25/woman-arrested-accused-killing-grandmothers-dog/">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Kyoko Smith, 18, was charged on November 22 for the crime.</p>

      <p>“I asked her, 'hey, what are you doing?' She said, 'oh your dog is cold, your dog is cold.' That's the only thing she'd say,” one neighbor said.</p>
