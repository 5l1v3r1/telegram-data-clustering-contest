      <p>The US defence secretary Monday defended the decision to sack his navy secretary, saying he went behind his back to make a deal with the White House over a convicted <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/us-navy-defies-trump-proceeds-in-effort-to-expel-seal-264269">Navy SEAL's </a>future.</p>
      <p>Mark Esper told reporters that <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/trump-fires-us-navy-chief-richard-spencer-over-seal-case-264270">Richard Spencer</a>, the Navy's top civilian, admitted to him that he had gone around Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley.</p>
      <p>"We were completely caught off guard by this information, and realized that it undermined everything we have been discussing with the president."</p>
      <p>Spencer was fired on Sunday amid a White House-Pentagon dispute over whether the Navy SEAL, accused of war crimes in a high-profile case but found guilty of a lesser offence, should be expelled from the elite commando force.</p>
