      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">WWE Survivor Series 2019</a> ended on a high note with NXT defeating both RAW and SmackDown in the battle for brand supremacy. Although we saw the title-holders of each brand locking horns with their respective counterparts, the top Champions of all the three brands did not square off.</p>
      <p>Instead, they were booked to defend their title against a challenger from their brand in a singles match. Brock Lesnar defeated Rey Mysterio to retain his WWE Universal Championship, The Fiend successfully defended his title against Daniel Bryan, and Adam Cole protected his NXT gold against Pete Dunne.</p>
      <p>The fact that no title changed hands at one of WWE’s big 4 pay-per-views raised a few questions among the fans. In this list, we take a look at five possible theories behind the decision to have all the three Champions retain their title on Sunday night.</p>

      <p>While Adam Cole has had a long run with his NXT Championship, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/brock-lesnar">Brock Lesnar</a> and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/bray-wyatt">Bray Wyatt</a> have held their respective titles for only a few weeks. The ‘Beast Incarnate’ defeated Kofi Kingston within seconds to win the WWE Championship at the beginning of October whereas ‘The Fiend’ defeated Seth Rollins to win the Universal Championship on the last day of the previous month.</p>
      <p>The WWE Creatives would have been subjected to extensive backlash from the fans if either of these two Champions lost their title at Survivor Series. The WWE Universe often complains about Lesnar’s short title reigns coupled with his sporadic appearances.</p>
      <p>In the case of the Universal Championship, The Fiend finally won the title after an extended rivalry with ‘The Architect’. He is immensely over with the crowd and losing his title within three weeks would have caused the fans to turn on him.</p>
      <p>It was a safer option to have both these Champions retain their title. In the case of Adam Cole, he is currently feuding with Tommaso Ciampa for the championship and that storyline would have come to an abrupt end had he ended up losing his title to Pete Dunne at the PPV.</p>
