      <p>A veteran ice hockey player was whacked in the face by a puck and pulled nine of his own teeth out – but kept on playing.</p>
      <p>Florida Panthers defenseman Keith Yandle, 33, was filmed yanking his ruined teeth from his bloodied mouth during the game against the Carolina Hurricanes at the PNC Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He underwent some quick dental work afterwards, according to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7722259/Keith-Yandle-loses-nine-teeth-hit-mouth-puck.html?ito=social-twitter_dailymailus">MailOnline</a>, before heading back out onto the rink the next day to face the Buffalo Sabres.</p>
      <p>It is unclear whether Yandle’s lost teeth were his own, or whether he’d had veneers installed after a previous encounter with a puck.</p>
      <p>Sadly, Yandle’s injury was in vain, with the Panthers losing against both the Hurricanes and Sabres.</p>

      <p>But it marked an important milestone for the player, who has now played 821 consecutive games without missing one.</p>
      <p>That run, known as an iron man streak, is the longest of any active NHL player, and began in March 2009 when Yandle was a 14 year-old Phoenix Coyotes player.</p>
      <p>Yandle is now fifth in the all-time rankings, behind Canadian Doug Jarvis who played in 964 consecutive games between 1975 and 1987.</p>
      <p>The $44 million sportsman is estimated to beat that record in the second half of next season if he can keep going without any mishaps.</p>
      <p>Panthers coach Joel Quenneville hailed Yandle’s achievement, telling <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2019/11/24/keith-yandle-panthers-puck-to-mouth-teeth-iron-man/4292155002/">USA Today</a>: ‘In today’s day and age, with the pace of the game, he plays significant minutes.</p>

      <p>‘He’s not getting younger, still able to be ready at the start at the season, over the rigors of 82 game schedule, a lot of things can change.</p>
      <p>‘Whether you have the flu or have this or that, they compound over the season, to be fresh, (he) finds ways to overcome it and persevere, it is very remarkable.’</p>
