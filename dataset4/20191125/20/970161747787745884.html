      <p>A pedophile begged his 14 year-old victim not to expose his sexual abuse because he didn’t want to get raped in jail, police say.</p>
      <p>Milwaukee firefighter Robert Olson, 44, reportedly molested the girl on numerous occasions – then texted her begging her to stay silent, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>Olson, arrested last Wednesday, is said to have written: ‘I am so sorry got (sic) what happened, I didn’t mean to, please don’t go, please don’t tell anyone, I am going to prison, I’m going to get raped.</p>
      <p>‘I am so sorry…I want to help you…’</p>
      <p>Olson, a lieutenant with Milwaukee Fire Department, is also said to have texted his alleged victim’s family begging them for clemency.</p>

      <p>Those messages, shared by prosecutors read: ‘In the last three months since this happened, I have done a ton of work to regain trust.</p>
      <p>‘I have already made extreme life changes and carry this every day like a 100-pound weight no matter what it looks like on the outside.</p>
      <p>‘I assure you I’ve taken ownership and I’m still trying to.’</p>
      <p>But Olson’s pleas fell on deaf ears, with his alleged abuse later reported to Oak Creek Police Department.</p>
      <p>Further details of his alleged abuse have yet to be released, and it is unclear how he knew the girl reported to be his victim, or when the attacks happened.</p>
      <p>The Milwaukee Fire Department has also opened an internal investigation into Olson’s conduct and says it is taking the matter extremely seriously.</p>
      <p>He is also set to be suspended from his job as a result of the police investigation.</p>
      <p>He has been charged with sexual assault of a child under the age of 16, <a href="https://fox6now.com/2019/11/25/officials-milwaukee-fire-department-lieutenant-arrested-by-oak-creek-police/">Fox6</a> reported.</p>
