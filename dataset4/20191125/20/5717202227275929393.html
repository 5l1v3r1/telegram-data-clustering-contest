        <b>A number of West Ham United fans have taken to Twitter to comment on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/chris-wilder-considered-next-west-20951298">reports from the Daily Mirror suggesting</a> that the Hammers are interested in Chris Wilder.</b>

      <p>The Mirror suggests that both David Moyes and Chris Hughton are on the club’s radar. But it is also suggested that the Hammers are interested in Sheffield United boss Wilder.</p>

      <p>Wilder has done a fantastic job at Bramall Lane. He has won two promotions in three seasons. And United now sit sixth in their first campaign back in the Premier League.</p>
      <h3>West Ham fans pessimistic</h3>
      <p>It is no surprise that other top flight sides are taking an interest in Wilder. And it appears that plenty of West Ham fans would happily see Wilder replace Pellegrini.</p>
      <p>However, it is mentioned more than once that they cannot see why Wilder would choose to leave Sheffield United for West Ham. There is a large gap between the two in the table right now, and the Hammers supporters are clearly worried that their club is not moving in the right direction.</p>
