      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:12:20+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:12</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>Atlanta United chief Carlos Bocanegra heaped praise on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> as he revealed his excitement at the new Transatlantic link-up.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> star waxed lyrical about his side's link-up with the Dons as he delved into their "great history".</p>
      <p>The two clubs unveiled details of a strategic partnership earlier on Monday as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dave-cormack">Dave Cormack</a> replaced Stewart Milne as Pittodrie supremo.</p>
      <p>Bocanegra, of course, knows all about Aberdeen following his Ibrox spell between 2011 and 2013.</p>
      <p>He said: "We're extremely excited about this new partnership with Aberdeen.</p>

      <p>"It's a fantastic club, great history, European champs, lots of tradition.</p>
      <p>"They've got fantastic people that work for the club, they've got a great culture.</p>
      <p>"We couldn't be more excited to get going and utilise this partnership.</p>
      <p>Atlanta star Jon Gallagher is currently spending a season in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a> with the Dons and Bocanegra revealed a recent trip across the pond to check on the winger's progress.</p>
      <p>He added: "A good example is Jon Gallagher. Jon is on-loan with Aberdeen at the moment, he played some European games already this year.</p>
      <p>"I just spent some time with him over there in and around the club. It's been great to see how he's been integrating in a different type of league and a different style of play, different manager.</p>
      <p>"John's really expanding his horizons."</p>
