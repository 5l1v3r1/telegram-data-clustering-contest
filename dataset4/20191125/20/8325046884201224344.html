      <p>You’ve been eyeing the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/holiday-gift-guide">perfect holiday gift</a> for a while and finally decide to go for it. You swipe your credit card excitedly, walking out of the store with your new purchase. Then, you’re scrolling around on the internet only to realize it’s cheaper somewhere else. We’ve all been there.</p>
      <p>Usually, this is when anger ensues, but that doesn’t have to be the case. Plenty of retailers will price match, which means that if you can find a product for a lower price at another store, they’ll match that low price. In the end, if you use these policies correctly, you’ll save money and have peace of mind that you got the best deal out there.</p>
      <p>We outlined the price-match policies of seven major e-retailers, including <a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/196318/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2F">Walmart</a>, <a href="http://goto.target.com/c/196318/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2F">Target</a>, <a href="http://dicks-sporting-goods.ryvx.net/c/196318/315573/4835?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dickssportinggoods.com%2Fs%2Fprice-match-policy">Dick’s Sporting Goods</a>, <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/static/pricematch">Bed Bath &amp; Beyond</a>, <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.paragonsports.com/pages/price-match">Paragon Sports</a>, <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=35871X943606&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jcpenney.com%2Fm%2Four-lowest-price-guarantee%3FpageId%3Dpg40014800010">JCPenney</a>, and <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Fbest-buy-price-match-guarantee%2Fpcmcat297300050000.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat297300050000">Best Buy</a>. While all of these stores offer a price-matching feature of some sort, some policies are more lenient, while others are stricter, especially around <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/black-friday-deals">Black Friday</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cyber-monday-deals">Cyber Monday</a>.</p>
