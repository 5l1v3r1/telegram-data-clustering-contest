      <p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- Strong winds are likely to add further headaches to Thanksgiving travel and potentially ground some balloons at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.</p>
      <p>A storm system will move into the Tri-State area on Wednesday. There's not a lot of rain associated with the system, but we can expect a lot of wind.</p>
      <p>As the low deepens and passes by, those winds are going to be pretty steady for the parade on Thanksgiving, between 15-25 MPH out of the northwest with higher gusts. We could see wind gusts in excess of 40 and 50 MPH.</p>
      <p>The low is passing to the north, so the winds will be stronger in the Hudson Valley than they will be in the city.</p>
      <p>The good news is skies will be partly to mostly sunny.</p>
