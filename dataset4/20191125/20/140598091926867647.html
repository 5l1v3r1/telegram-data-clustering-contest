      <h1>Dr Richard Freeman's medical tribunal missed chance to hear Nicole Cooke evidence after Shane Sutton walkout</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:16:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/tom-cary/" target="_blank">Tom Cary</a></address>
      <p>Nicole Cooke, the former world and Olympic champion, was one of three individuals whose evidence would have been put to Shane Sutton <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cycling/2019/11/12/shane-sutton-denies-doping-claims-storming-medical-tribunal/">had the Australian not stormed out of Dr Richard Freeman’s medical tribunal</a> in Manchester two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Mary O’Rourke QC, who is <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cycling/2019/11/22/richard-freemans-barrister-calls-daily-mail-release-shane-sutton/">defending Freeman against allegations that he ordered a batch of testosterone to British Cycling’s Manchester headquarters</a> in 2011 knowing or believing that it was intended for an athlete, told the panel on Monday that Welsh rider Cooke was one of "three individuals" who was happy to be named.</p>
      <p>O’Rourke argued on Monday that all of Sutton’s evidence should be “totally discarded”. She added that if Sutton's evidence was thrown out, the four remaining charges against former Team Sky and British Cycling medic Freeman "fall apart”.</p>
      <p>Freeman, who admits 18 of the 22 charges against him in his fitness to practise tribunal, alleges that he was bullied by Sutton to order 30 sachets of Testogel for the coach's erectile dysfunction. Sutton, who denies that claim, had been scheduled to give evidence over the course of two days but left the hearing after less than two hours. </p>
      <p>The tribunal will decide this week whether Sutton’s part-heard evidence should be admissible.</p>
      <p>General Medical Council lawyer Simon Jackson QC argued that it should, saying that Sutton had left the hearing as a "direct consequence" of O'Rourke's "bullying" during the session. </p>
      <p>Jackson said Sutton had been "put in the public stocks" by O'Rourke, who told the tribunal that he was a "liar" and a "doper" ahead of Sutton’s cross-examination, knowing her claims would be picked up by the media.</p>
      <p>O’Rourke countered that Jackson could have made greater efforts to keep Sutton at the tribunal. And she expressed amazement that he had said "not a word about Sutton's appalling behaviour in the witness box” in his submissions. "He was threatening me, and threatening Richard Freeman,” said O’Rourke.</p>
      <p>The tribunal has been adjourned until Wednesday morning as the panel discuss the applications, with O'Rourke set to make an application to have the four charges thrown out based on the outcome.</p>
