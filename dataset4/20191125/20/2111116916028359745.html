      <p>Digital transformation is beneficial to any business, and it can lead to a massive impact. When a company decides to embrace 3D printing as a part of a manufacturing process or to implement a new 5G data strategy, there are clear dividends. The company operates more efficiently, the employees communicate more effectively. It’s exciting to watch as a company decides to choose which emerging tech to research, evaluate, and deploy.</p>
      <p>Of course, deciding which disruptive tech is going to help the firm the most is often the first initial challenge. These resources will help you not just discover and develop a strategy for digital transformation, they will help you decide how and when to deploy them.</p>
