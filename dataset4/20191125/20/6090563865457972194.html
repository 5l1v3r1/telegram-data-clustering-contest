      <p>A-12-year old girl from Chitungwiza has committed suicide inside her parents house this evening over grade 7 results, ZW News, has been told.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred around 6pm in Unit C, Chitungwiza.</p>
      <p>Sources privy to the incident suspect that the girl might have killed herself over her poorly performed grade 7 results.</p>
      <p>Results were released last Friday and distributed to schools during the weekend and pupils started accessing them from schools today.</p>
      <p>According to Zimsec the national pass rate dropped by five percent compared to last year, with only indigenous languages namely Shona and Ndebele performing well.</p>
      <p>The body of the deceased spent at least two hours inside the house at number ** unit C1 near Tamuka Primary School as police were yet to arrive at the scene.</p>
      <p>The deceased’s identity will be announced in due course after her relatives have been formally notified.</p>
      <p>Reports from the neighbourhood suggest that the girl collected her grade 7 results today only to fail to accept that she had performed dismally.</p>
      <p>“We are saddened by the loss of such a kid who had a bright future ahead of her. She probably failed to accept her poor grade 7 results,” the source exclusively told ZWNews.com.</p>
      <p>A local pastor, Mr Prosper Zendera said the nation should pray for the spirit of suicides among youngsters following the recent death of a Churchill High pupil who committed suicide at Parkade in the CBD.</p>
      <p>The Parkade area has also become a black spot after a local prominent pastor last month also jumped to his death at the same spot.</p>
