      <p>In what may feel like a plot from an Ocean's film, thieves in Germany have pulled off what is reportedly one of the greatest heists in modern history. Up to 1 billion euros worth of historic treasures were stolen from the Green Vault Museum in Dresden, Germany, early Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Both German police and media are calling it one of the largest art thefts since the second World War, reports <i><a href="https://www.afp.com/en/news/3954/germanys-treasury-chamber-museum-dresden-robbed-doc-1mk2gq1">Agence France-Presse</a></i>. The museum itself is one of the oldest in Europe; it's home to around 4,000 cherished valuables made of ivory, silver, gold, and jewels.</p>
      <p>To pull off the brazen robbery, the burglars reportedly cut the power from a nearby distributor, which caused an electrical fire and deactivated the museum's alarm system. They did not go entirely undetected, however — <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/25/dresden-robbery-thieves-grab-jewels-treasures-worth-up-to-a-billion-euros.html">NBC News reports</a> the two suspects were caught on surveillance video entering the museum by bending the iron bar fence and breaking through a glass window.</p>
      <p>Marion Ackerman, the director of Dresden's art collections, said the stolen items included "priceless" sets of diamonds, notes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/25/thieves-steal-priceless-treasures-dresden-green-vault-museum"><i>The Guardian</i></a>. The sets included brilliant-cut diamonds from an 18th-century jewelry collection. <a href="https://www.thelocal.de/20191125/treasury-chamber-museum-in-dresden-robbed-german-police">Ackerman said</a> the items are of "inestimable art historical and cultural-historical value."</p>
      <p>Local authorities have yet to identify the specific items missing or make any arrests, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/25/dresden-robbery-thieves-grab-jewels-treasures-worth-up-to-a-billion-euros.html">police spokesman Marco Laske said</a>.</p>
      <p>Michael Krestschmer, the Minister President of Saxony, where Dresden resides, <a href="https://twitter.com/MPKretschmer/status/1198897664273850368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">tweeted</a> in response to the incident. "Not only the state art collections were robbed, but we Saxons," he said, per a translation of his tweet. "One can't understand the story of Saxony, without the Green Vault." Police and investigators are still on the scene and the Green Vault is shut, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/dresden-green-vault-heist-treasures-valued-at-a-billion-dollars-stolen-from-german-palace-thieves-cut-alarm?ref=scroll">notes </a><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/dresden-green-vault-heist-treasures-valued-at-a-billion-dollars-stolen-from-german-palace-thieves-cut-alarm?ref=scroll"><i>The Daily Beast</i></a>.</p>
