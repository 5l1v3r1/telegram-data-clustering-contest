      <p>Four technical cooperation projects between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency were approved during the agency’s board of governors meeting last week, according to Iran's envoy to the IAEA.  "After negotiations between the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and the IAEA … four new technical cooperation projects for the 2020-21 period were approved for our country," Kazem Gharibabadi said, ISNA reported.  He added that the two previous joint projects on power plants and cancer therapy were also agreed to continue during 2020 and 2021.  The new projects would cost over €1 million and will be funded by the IAEA, according to Gharibabadi. "They cover areas including safety improvement of nuclear research reactors, human capacity building in the nuclear energy sector, increasing cereal production capacity and waste management."  The technical cooperation program is the IAEA's primary mechanism for transferring nuclear technology to member states, helping them to address key development priorities in areas such as health and nutrition, food and agriculture, water and the environment, industrial applications, and nuclear knowledge development and management.  The program also helps member states to identify and meet future energy needs, and assists in improving radiation safety and nuclear security worldwide, including through the provision of legislative assistance.</p>
