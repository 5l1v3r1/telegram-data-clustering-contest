      <p>Israel was set to expel the country director of Human Rights Watch on Monday after a lengthy court battle over claims he supports a boycott of the Jewish state.</p>
      <p>US citizen Omar Shakir, the New York-based rights group’s director for Israel and the Palestinian territories, denies the claims and accuses the Israeli government of seeking to suppress dissent.</p>
      <p>Shakir’s deportation, expected in the afternoon, would be the first from inside the country under Israel’s controversial 2017 law allowing the expulsion of foreigners who support a boycott, according to authorities.</p>

      <p>The European Union, United Nations and others have criticised the looming expulsion, with the UN warning of a “shrinking space for human rights defenders to operate” in Israel and the Palestinian territories.</p>
      <p>But the United States, Israel’s closest ally, declined to do so, saying Sunday only that it supported freedom of expression.</p>
      <p>The rights group said Shakir would continue in his position despite being expelled, working from neighbouring Jordan.</p>
      <p><b>‘Boycott support’</b><br/>Israel refused to extend Shakir’s work permit in May 2018 after parliament passed a law mandating the expulsion of foreign supporters of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement.</p>
      <p>BDS activists call for a broad-ranging embargo of Israel over its treatment of the Palestinians.</p>
      <p>Israel sees the movement as a strategic threat and accuses it of anti-Semitism. Activists strongly deny this and compare it to the economic isolation that helped bring down apartheid in South Africa.</p>
      <p>Shakir, who started in the HRW Israel post in 2017, appealed but Israel’s supreme court backed the government’s decision earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The case against Shakir was initially based on statements he had made supporting a boycott before joining HRW.</p>
      <p>But the government also highlighted work he did with rights groups, including criticising Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.</p>
      <p>“The Israeli government pretends it is only deporting Omar Shakir and that it is not penalising Human Rights Watch,” its executive director Ken Roth told AFP Sunday.</p>
      <p>“But in fact it is deporting him for the core message of Human Rights Watch with respect to the settlements.”</p>
      <p>More than 600,000 Israelis live in settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, communities considered illegal under international law.</p>
      <p>Israel disputes this, and the United States last week broke with decades of international consensus and announced it no longer considered the settlements illegal.</p>
      <p>Roth contended that US President Donald Trump’s support for Israel’s fellow right-wing government had emboldened it to crack down on human rights groups.</p>
      <p>“It is hard to imagine Omar’s deportation going ahead if the US government hadn’t given a kind of implicit green light,” he told AFP.</p>
      <p>The US embassy said only it had raised Shakir’s case with Israel and that it supports “freedom of expression.”</p>
      <p>“At the same time, our strong opposition to boycotts and sanctions of the State of Israel is well known,” it said.</p>
      <p><b>‘Move backfired’</b><br/>Israel’s Ministry of Strategic Affairs, which led the campaign to expel Shakir, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>The right-wing group NGO Monitor meanwhile charged that HRW’s record was anti-Israel.</p>
      <p>“It’s the singling out we disagree with,” said Gerald Steinberg, head of the organisation which argues that international organisations put a disproportionate focus on Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
      <p>“They are not saying ‘we disagree with Israeli policy but we believe in the Jewish people’s right to self-determination’,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It is about ‘we don’t believe in the Jewish state’s right to exist’,” he argued.</p>
      <p>HRW strongly denied the claim.</p>
      <p>NGO Monitor provided evidence to the government’s case and Steinberg argued that not renewing a visa was “standard practice” in democracies.</p>
      <p>Yet Steinberg admitted that Israel’s move had created negative publicity that helps its critics.</p>
      <p>“This is playing into their hands,” he said. “Shakir is milking this, they are going to dance their way out of the airport.”</p>
      <p>Roth agreed that Israel’s move had actually intensified scrutiny of Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories.</p>
      <p>“The world isn’t fooled,” he said. “When you try to censor something, the first thing you do is say ‘well what is it you are trying to censor?'”</p>
