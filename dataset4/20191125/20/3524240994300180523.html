      <p>President of a Mapo Customary Court in Ibadan, Ademola Odunade, on Monday dissolved the 18-month marriage between one Rukayat Adedoja and her husband, Afeez, over childlessness and lack of understanding.</p>
      <p>Odunade, while dissolving the union, lamented that some marriages collapse prematurely because those involved do not study each other properly before embarking on the relationship.</p>
      <p>He hinged the dissolution of the marriage between Rukayat and Afeez on absence of peace in the union and directed the duo to maintain order at all times.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Rukayat, who had relocated to Offa in Kwara State, said she was no longer interested in the union, adding that Afeez was hampering her child-bearing efforts.</p>
      <p>“Ever since I got married to Afeez one and a half years ago, he had frustrated all my efforts at getting pregnant.</p>
      <p>“As if that was not enough, Afeez often used derogatory statements.</p>
      <p>“He also starved me of sex, in addition to not joining hands with me on how to find a medical solution to my lack of conception.</p>
      <p>“Besides, Afeez beats me at will, knowing that I have no relative in Ibadan,” Rukayat stated.</p>
      <p>Consenting to the suit, the respondent tendered the evidence at his disposal to deny all the allegations leveled against him.</p>
      <p>Afeez, a resident of Bodija in Ibadan, said his wife married him based on deception.</p>
      <p>“With my little salary as a security officer, I spend 95 percent of my monthly earnings to ensure that Rukayat conceives, but she doesn’t love me and couldn’t conceive.</p>
      <p>“During a minor misunderstanding between us, Rukayat wanted to stab me with a knife.</p>
      <p>“But when she heard knocks at the door, she told my relatives that she seized the knife from me because I wanted to use it against her</p>
      <p>“Rukayat has three flourishing businesses I opened for her and recently she demanded N50,000 which I gave her before she abandoned me for three weeks.</p>
      <p>“I am pleased to let her go,” Afeez said.</p>
