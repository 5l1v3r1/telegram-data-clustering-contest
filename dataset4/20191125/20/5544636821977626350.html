      <p>Former Minister of Aviation Femi Fani-Kayode has wondered if it is a crime to be an Igbo in Nigeria, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>This news platform understands that Fani-Kayode said this on Monday in a reaction to the fraud charges against the Chairman of Air Peace Airlines Allen Onyema.</p>
      <p>The United States Department of Justice indicted Onyema for moving more than $20 million from Nigeria through US bank accounts in a scheme involving false documents based on the purchase of airplanes.</p>
      <p>According to a statement posted on the US Justice department’s website, Air Peace Chief of Administration and Finance, Ejiroghene Eghagha, was also charged with bank fraud and committing aggravated identity theft in connection with the scheme.</p>
      <p>U.S. Attorney Byung J. Pak, said: “Onyema allegedly leveraged his status as a prominent business leader and airline executive while using falsified documents to commit fraud. We will diligently protect the integrity of our banking system from being corrupted by criminals, even when they disguise themselves in a cloak of international business.”</p>
      <p>The Special Agent in Charge of the DEA Atlanta Field Division, Robert J. Murphy, said: “Allen Onyema’s status as a wealthy businessman turned out to be a fraud. He corrupted the U.S. banking system, but his trail of deceit and trickery came to a skidding halt. DEA would like to thank the many law enforcement partners and the subsequent prosecution by the U.S. Attorney’s Office who aided in making this investigation a success.”</p>
      <p>In a tweet on his handle, the chieftain of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) listed some Igbo businessmen that have faced similar issues like Onyema.</p>
      <p>“First,” he tweeted, “it was Cletus Ibeto of Ibeto Cement, then it was Ifeanyi Uba of Capital Oil, then it was Innocent Chukwuma of Innoson Motors and now it is Allen Oyema of Air Peace.</p>
      <p>“Is it a crime to be an Igbo in Nigeria?”</p>
