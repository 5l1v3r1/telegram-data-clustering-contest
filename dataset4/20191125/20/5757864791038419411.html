      <p>If you heard “Bohemian Rhapsody” before you knew about the legendary band behind it, you might’ve thought it was performed by a full-scale symphony orchestra and choir, with a little help from an electric guitarist or two.</p>
      <p>While the instrumentals and back-up vocals undoubtedly make the song an operatic rock classic, it’s the unparalleled vocal talents of frontman <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/586134/freddie-mercury-sings-time-waits-for-no-one-new-video">Freddie Mercury</a> that send chills through your whole body—and the same could be said about pretty much every other Queen song, too.</p>
      <p>To celebrate the legacy of Mercury, who passed away from AIDS-related causes 28 years ago this past Sunday, November 24, YouTube and Google Research teamed up to develop the <a href="https://freddiemeter.withyoutube.com/">FreddieMeter</a>, an interactive karaoke tool that compares your voice to his.</p>
      <p>After choosing one of four song options, which include “Somebody to Love,” “Don’t Stop Me Now,” “We Are the Champions,” and “<a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/70634/10-operatic-facts-about-bohemian-rhapsody">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>,” and enabling microphone access, an instrumental version of the song will begin to play. The AI-powered FreddieMeter will analyze your timbre, pitch, and melody as you sing along with the flashing words, and you’ll then be given a scorecard that compares your voice to Freddie’s.</p>
      <p>Though we don’t have any statistics on what’s considered a respectable score, CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/24/entertainment/freddie-mercury-death-singing-challenge-trnd/index.html">reports</a> that one of their editors (who chose to remain anonymous) finished what was surely an admirable attempt at “We Are the Champions” with 11 percent.</p>

      <p>The FreddieMeter was created with The Mercury Phoenix Trust, an HIV/AIDS-fighting charity founded in Mercury’s memory by fellow band members Brian May and Roger Taylor, along with manager Jim Beach.</p>
