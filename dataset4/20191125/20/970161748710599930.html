      <p>She also confirmed that some of the songs on her upcoming second studio album Romance are about the Stitches singer – and that she never had time to fall in love before meeting Shawn.</p>
      <p>Well, she did join Fifth Harmony on X Factor USA at the tender age of 16.</p>
      <p>‘Like, from my first album to now, it’s probably what’s influenced my entire album,’ the Havana singer explained. ‘And it being called Romance and it being about falling in love, I literally did not have time to fall in love before the age of 20, because I was just working all the time.’</p>
      <p>‘Everything from my first album was drawn from my imagination,’ she added. ‘I was single for like 20 years!’</p>
