      <p><b>WASHINGTON D.C. (WVLT) --</b> A statement from the United States Department of Agriculture said the country is short on sugar.</p>
      <p>According to the statement, the USDA told the Department of Commerce that the U.S. had "an additional need for sugar" on Monday, November 25.</p>
      <p>The USDA said the shortage is due to "adverse weather in both sugar beet and sugarcane regions. In the November 2019 World Agricultural Supply &amp; Demand Estimates Report, the U.S. sugar production projection declined by 572,000 short tons raw value from the previous month."</p>
      <p>The statement added that "ongoing" weather issues continue to threaten the supply.</p>
      <p>Due to the shortage, the Department of Commerce increased the amount of Mexican refined sugar to be exported.</p>
