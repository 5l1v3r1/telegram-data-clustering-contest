      <p>Bolivia slowly resumed normal activities on Monday, with schools and businesses reopening after weeks of disruptive protests, as the country prepares for new elections without ex-president Evo Morales.</p>
      <p>Traffic was heavy in La Paz, the epicenter of demonstrations that have raged since a disputed October 20 presidential election, after gas stations were able to replenish fuel supplies.</p>
      <p>Schools re-opened while most supermarkets and restaurants were operating normally in the seat of government as shortages eased.</p>
      <p>"We are returning to normal after something very hard and very dramatic," interim President Jeanine Anez told reporters Monday, a day after signing a law authorizing new elections seen as crucial to ending unrest in the landlocked country.</p>
      <p>Mother-of-two Jazmin Chavez said her children were pleased to be back at school after nearly a month stuck at home.</p>

      <p>"They are happy, they have returned to class, they have seen their friends again," Chavez, 34, told AFP.</p>
      <p>Blockades on major transport routes have been mostly removed, officials said, except in the central coca-growing region of Chapare, where farmers loyal to Morales continue obstructing a key highway.</p>
      <p>They are demanding justice for nine protesters killed during clashes with police on November 15.</p>
      <p>"There are still roadblocks at different points despite an agreement signed" Sunday with the government to lift them, Franz Celis, a deputy police commander in Cochabamba, told reporters.</p>
      <p>Ongoing talks between the caretaker government and opposition groups in La Paz aimed at ending the country's worst crisis in 16 years appear to be defusing tensions.</p>
      <p>"I've felt a peace that we haven't been able to find for a month," Silvia Maita, an auditor, told AFP.</p>
      <p>"I'm happy going back to work and working normal hours. We hope it stays like this."</p>

      <p>Hydrocarbons Minister Victor Hugo Zamora said Monday 700,000 propane gas cylinders were available in La Paz and El Alto, which had suffered severe shortages after protesters blocked a key fuel plant.</p>
      <p>"We are normalizing fuel distribution," Zamora said.</p>
      <p>"We want to convey calm and avoid the worry and despair of users."</p>

      <p>Dozens of people have been killed since the disputed October 20 election, many of them in clashes with security forces.</p>
      <p>Morales claimed victory, but opposition groups said the results had been rigged.</p>
      <p>He fled to Mexico, where he was granted political asylum following his November 10 resignation, after losing the support of the police and military.</p>
      <p>Congress on Saturday gave a green light for a new vote without Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president. He had been seeking a fourth term after nearly 14 years as leader of the poor but resource-rich country.</p>
      <p>Anez, a right-wing senator who declared herself interim leader after Morales quit, signed the bill into law Sunday, vowing "clean, fair and transparent" elections.</p>

      <p>The law annuls the results of the October 20 vote and bars candidates who served in both of the two previous terms from seeking re-election for the same position.</p>
      <p>That prevents Morales from contesting the presidency in the new ballot.</p>
      <p>The next step will be for Congress to agree on a new seven-member electoral court, after members of the previous panel were removed for allegedly manipulating results.</p>
      <p>The tribunal will be tasked with setting a date for the new vote, which Anez said previously she wants to happen as soon as possible.</p>
