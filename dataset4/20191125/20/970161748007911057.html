        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/linda-carter/">Linda Carter</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kellie-bright/">Kellie Bright</a>) has been turning to alcohol in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tv-soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> as a method of coping with all of the stress that she’s been under, but tonight she found herself facing the consequences, as she was arrested for driving under the influence. This is seemingly just the beginning of what’s going to be <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/04/eastenders-spoilers-major-alcoholism-storyline-revealed-for-linda-carter-10686054/">a long-running storyline for The Queen Vic landlady</a>, but — with her determined to face this on her own — will she end up losing her battle?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It has become incredibly apparent over the last few weeks that Linda <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/what-is-wrong-with-linda-carter-in-eastenders-11079366/">has been drinking more than usual</a>. With her stressing about Ollie’s diagnosis — not to mention her worries about Mick’s (Danny Dyer) health, as well as the upcoming pub competition — she’s turned to the bottle, and tonight’s episode opened with Linda battling another hangover.</p>
      <p>With Mick due at the doctors, Linda felt like she had little choice but to take Ollie to school herself. However, after arriving at the school gates, Linda found herself distracted as she discussed Christmas presents with Ollie, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/eastenders-spoilers-car-crash-drama-for-linda-carter-11014391/">ending up backing into the vehicle behind her</a> — which resulted in said vehicle’s alarm going off.</p>

      <p>Desperately hoping nobody had seen, the Carter matriarch drove off, but — unbeknown to her — Mieko had watched the whole thing unfold.</p>

      <p>Later, as Linda exited the school with Chantelle (Jessica Plummer), she was horrified to discover that the vehicle she’d backed into was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/03/eastenders-spoilers-linda-carter-is-in-hot-water-after-shirleys-violence-10885258/">Shelley</a>’s — <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/05/who-is-shelley-in-eastenders-and-what-happened-between-her-and-shirley-carter-11045443/">the mum she’d clashed with previously</a>. What’s more, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/eastenders-spoilers-linda-carter-is-arrested-as-her-drinking-gets-out-of-control-11014380/">Shelley had called the police on her</a>, as Mieko had informed her of what had happened.</p>
      <p>Linda attempted to defend herself, claiming that she wanted to take Ollie into school and out of the way before such a scene unfolded, but Shelley made a remark about Linda possibly being under the influence, which resulted in the police officer asking her to take a breathalyser test.</p>
      <p>Horrified, Linda agreed to do so, and upon getting a positive reading for alcohol, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/eastenders-spoilers-linda-carter-alcoholic-arrested-11215313/">the policewoman subsequently arrested her</a>. Later, Linda revealed that she’s due to appear in court — and could face a driving ban.</p>
      <p>Back at home, Mick was grinning from ear-to-ear, as he’d come up with a way to make <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/eastenders-spoilers-wife-swap-disaster-walford-residents-11022436/">the Wife Swap competition</a> all the more appealing to the Walford residents. What’s more, he got on well at the doctors too. With her husband in such a good mood, Linda felt unable to reveal the truth, and thus resolved to keep the information to herself.</p>

      <p>Later, Ruby (Louisa Lytton) offered to buy Linda a drink, but — beginning to realise the effect the booze is having on her — she ultimately declined.</p>
      <p>However, after making another unsuccessful attempt to reveal all to Mick, Linda turned to the bottle once more, as she downed a large glass of champagne.</p>

      <p>While the seeds of Linda’s alcoholism narrative have been ever so expertly planted over the last few weeks, tonight’s episode was the first inkling of the Queen Vic landlady realising that alcohol is becoming something of a problem for her.</p>

      <p>With the storyline set to become a long-running one, Linda will no doubt have to face up to the fact that she’s becoming an alcoholic. However, with her finding it difficult to confide in anyone at this current moment in time, it seems as if she will continue to suffer in silence — something which will no doubt result in her continuing to seek solace in alcohol.</p>
      <p>The question is: with her alcoholism getting worse, will Linda die as a result?</p>
      <p>It’s no doubt a possibility given that she’s afraid to open up to those around her — and working in a pub will no doubt make her reliance on drink worse.</p>
      <p>If history has taught us anything, it’s that the Carters are at their strongest when they’re united and honest with one another, so here’s hoping that Linda will find the strength — <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/12/13/6-big-moments-which-prove-linda-carter-is-the-queen-of-eastenders-8233335/">that very strength that she’s demonstrated on countless occasions in the past</a> — to be honest with her husband — for her own sake.</p>
      <p>Will Mick cop on to what’s going on and — much like he always does — help the love of his life through her tough time?</p>
