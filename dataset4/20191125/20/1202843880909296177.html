      <p>DOHA: Major Ali Al Ali, Assistant Executive Director for Security Affairs at the Supreme Committee for Delivery &amp; Legacy (SC), said the preparations for the Arabian Gulf Cup 2019 that will start tomorrow evening, are planned well in advance to ensure everyone's safety.</p>
      <p>Al Ali said that Qatar has lots of experience in organizing such sporting events and this will be one of the most successful sporting events.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Qatar Radio today he pointed out that videos are posted on social media explaining to public the streets they must take to reach their entry points and there are enough organizers to guide the public.</p>
      <p>Asked whether parking was available to everyone at the stadium, he said parking area depends on the ticket type and there are seven parking areas.</p>
      <p>Regarding the entry of public to the gates, he said that the committee has studied all the stages that precede the arrival of the public to the stadiums, even from the house to the stadium, whether through the metro or taxi or private vehicles.</p>
      <p>Many security agencies and specialized teams are involved in the organization. There is coordination with Public Works Authority 'Ashghal' and with the Ministry of Municipality and Environment in addition to other bodies.</p>
      <p>To avoid traffic jam, the organizing committee urged people to use public transportation instead of private vehicles.</p>
      <p>The Arabian Gulf Cup 2019 will be played at two stadiums: Abdullah bin Khalifa Stadium in Al Duhail) and the 2022 World Cup Khalifa Stadium.</p>
