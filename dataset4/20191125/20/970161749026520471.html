      <h1>Denying a woman an opinion is chauvinism, not chivalry</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:08:08+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://metro.co.uk/author/nicola-thorp/" target="_blank">Nicola Thorp</a></address>
      <p>The #MeToo movement led to a global calling out of sexism within society. Bad men doing bad things to women. However, in order to truly tackle the issue of sexism we must also call out good men who do well intentioned things without realising they are sexist. When it comes to prejudicial ‘isms’, I’d like to think that the majority of decent people don’t intend to cause harm. But racism, sexism, ablism and the like are so institutionalised, so culturally engrained in society, that unless we all take an active role in calling out the good people too, and adapting our own behaviour, inequality prevails. If you watched <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> last night, you may have noticed a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/im-celebrity-fans-side-kate-garraway-james-haskell-chivalry-clash-11213386/">moment of friction between </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-haskell/">James Haskell</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/im-celebrity-fans-side-kate-garraway-james-haskell-chivalry-clash-11213386/"> and Kate Garraway</a> that was borne out of well-meant ignorance. It’s their second week in the jungle, and after a diet of mostly rice and beans, it’s fair to say that patience is wearing thin in the celebrity camp. Campmates were told that the prize at the end of the live Bushtucker Trial would be a full roast dinner for each star won. They were tasked with listing their fellow campmates order of who they felt deserved a roast dinner the most. For each missing star, a celeb at the bottom of the list would have to forgo a Yorkshire pud and all the trimmings. Recently elected camp leader, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/declan-donnelly-hits-back-james-haskell-awkward-im-celebrity-clash-go-11213250/">James Haskell, led the charge</a> as the celebrities decided who should go at the top. A noble leader, James sacrificed himself and offered to go at the very bottom, making him least likely to eat more than rations for dinner. But then he instructed that the women in the group all automatically go to the top of the list. This decision was met with a confirmatory chorus of baritone ‘Yeah, yeah, ladies first’, from the lads in the camp.</p>
      <blockquote>We all have a part to play in stamping out even well-intended sexism. The true act of chivalry would’ve been for one of the men to stick up for Kate and allow her to have her voice heard.</blockquote>
      <p>Kate Garraway stepped in saying she didn’t mind going further down the list. It was then that there became some sort of sudden Bushtucker competition to see which man in camp could object the loudest. Kate was spoken over and dismissed before James announced, ‘Can we just agree that, moving forward, I’m more comfortable, and I think every man here is more comfortable with women going first so we cut out all the chivalrous nonsense’. Look, I love James Haskell. I think he’s been the most caring, witty and entertaining celebrity in the camp this year. As a rugby player, MMA fighter and son-in-law to Richard and Judy, he’s not someone I’d like to pick an argument with, but it’s attitudes like his that stop women from feeling like their opinion is valid in a group decision-making process. A ‘women first’ attitude is one that I thought had been consigned to history. Especially in an environment where the women have proven themselves more than capable of taking on physical, emotional and psychological tasks with aplomb. It came across as patronising, although I’m sure it was not intended to be so. Even when a sacrifice is being made in order to benefit us, women still deserve a say in the matter. The scene played out like a stereotypical boardroom meeting: Men make the decisions while the women follow orders, and if they object they are drowned out by a cacophony of chauvinism camouflaged as chivalry. Kate even went on to explain that it was James himself who was the one creating the chivalrous nonsense that he claimed to want stamping out, but he wasn’t having any of it and because no one else spoke up in support of Kate, she was silenced. I wish one of the other campmates had helped him to see sense. It’s situations like these that make a lone woman standing up for herself look ‘hysterical’ or ‘difficult’.<br/>Of course Kate wanted a roast dinner, just as much as the boys wanted a roast dinner. But she should also be allowed to sacrifice it for the benefit of another, even if that ‘other’ is a bloke. We all have a part to play in stamping out even well-intended sexism. The true act of chivalry would’ve been for one of the men to stick up for Kate and allow her to have her voice heard. Men often ask me whether they should hold open a door for a woman. I tell them to ask themselves, ‘am I doing it because it’s the polite thing to do, or because it’s a woman?’ If a woman tells you she doesn’t want the open door, or the special treatment, or the roast dinner, then pack up your pride and listen.</p>
