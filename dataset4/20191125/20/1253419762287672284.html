      <h1>CD Project RED on multiplayer and microtransactions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:57:11+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:57</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kountouras</a></address>
      <p>CD Project RED has already confirmed that there will be no microtransactions in <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>. After that they announced a multiplayer mode for the game, which will come after the game has been released.</p>
      <p>Recently a financial teleconference took place and hold by Piotr Nielubowitz, CDPR’s Vice President of finances and Adam Kicinski, CDPR CEO. In there you can listen about monetization in the multiplayer.</p>
      <p>The multiplayer is in early development and right now we have no idea when it will be ready. While this news might be alarming, I think it is way too early to come to any conclusions. Hopefully CDPR will stay true to their customers, as they’ve done so far.</p>
      <p>You can listen to the financial teleconference <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2019/11/teleconference-q3-2019-financial-results.mp3">here</a>.</p>
