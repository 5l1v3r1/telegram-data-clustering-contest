      <h1>'That’s Why We Brought Him To Sundowns’</h1>

      <p>Andile Jali has been showered with praise for his Man of the Match performance in Mamelodi Sundowns’ 2-1 win over Golden Arrows.</p>
      <p>The ex-Orlando Pirates star was also on the scoresheet against the same team in an Absa Premiership clash before the international break, though Downs were on the losing end following a 3-2 defeat at a rain-soaked Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium.</p>

      <p>“I think AJ played a fantastic and brilliant game. He showed his experience. He is a player we brought to Sundowns and he is showing why. I was afraid he would get a yellow also and we would have been in trouble because all my substitutes were forced,” Mosimane told reporters after the game on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Jali struggled to get game-time at Sundowns after he arrived there in July last year – being used in a mere 16 matches out of more than 50 in all competitions. </p>
      <p>There were even talks he would look to find a new home elsewhere, but his agent, Mike Makaab, confirmed at the time that his five-year contract made that near impossible. </p>
      <p>He did still pick up a league championship medal, and Jali will be hoping to have much more of an influence if Downs are to retain the title in this campaign.  </p>
