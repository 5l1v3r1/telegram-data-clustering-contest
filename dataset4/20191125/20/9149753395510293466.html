      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:20:02+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/anchalk/" target="_blank">Andy Chalk</a></address>
      <p>For those of you who've been holding onto, your, uh horses before deciding to tackle <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/red-dead-redemption-2-tips/">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> due to the various performance issues it has suffered since launch, that time may be nigh.

      <p>The reaction <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PCRedDead/comments/e1hgar/rdr2_title_update_115_notes_ps4_xbox_one_stadia_pc/">on Reddit</a> is, as usual, mixed—some people report improvements, others are less impressed, and of course there are plenty of complaints about other issues not addressed by the patch. Everyone is happy about one important aspect of the update, though: It won't <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-please-stop-changing-my-red-dead-2-settings-every-time-theres-a-patch/">reset your graphics settings</a> after it's applied. </p>
