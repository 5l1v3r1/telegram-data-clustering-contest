      <p>Simon Cowell is tipped to produce and release a Christmas charity single with all of this year’s X Factor: Celebrity cast.</p>
      <p>Reports claim that Simon has postponed the annual winners single, instead making a charity cover of Snow Patrol’s Run with all the acts from the live shows.</p>
      <p>“Since streaming influenced the charts it’s become incredibly difficult for X Factor acts to top the charts on the back of the show, so everyone is being realistic,” a source told <a href="https://www.thesun.ie/tvandshowbiz/tv/4812292/simon-cowell-plans-to-release-a-christmas-charity-single-featuring-all-of-this-years-x-factor-celebrity-cast/">The Sun</a>.</p>

      <p>“But the winner’s song is just being rested, because a group charity track just seemed a better fit this time round.”</p>
      <p>A winner’s song is still expected to be recorded and released.</p>
      <p>The X Factor has previously released charity singles.</p>
