      <p>Speaking about the Summer 2020 Tour, the group said: “Performing live is our favourite thing to do as a band, we love it.</p>
      <p>“Our last Summer tour in 2018 was one of our favourites ever, so we can’t wait for some more brilliant outdoor shows next year.</p>
      <p>"We want everyone to come party with us in the sunshine!”</p>
      <p>Tickets are on sale at 9am on Thursday November 28 at <a href="http://www.gigsinscotland.com/">www.gigsinscotland.com</a>.</p>
      <p>At least 75p from every brief will be donated to Nordoff Robbins - a charity that uses music therapy to help people affected by life-limiting illness, isolation or disability.</p>
      <p>Fans will be treated to a show filled with the chart-toppers' greatest hits like Touch, Black Magic and Shout Out To My Ex.</p>
      <p>The girlband have sold more than 50million records worldwide since their formation in 2011.</p>
      <p>They have also racked up more than 17 million Spotify listeners, received more than 3 billion Youtube views, and collated 12 billion streams worldwide.</p>
      <p>Little Mix have bagged four UK No.1s and four platinum-selling albums.</p>
      <p>The girls played three nights at Glasgow's SSE Hydro last month and played the AECC in Aberdeen during their summer tour last year.</p>
      <p>But the <a href="http://bit.ly/2mQr72k">outdoor gig turned into a nightmare</a> for some fans as they had to<a href="http://bit.ly/2mQr72k"> lift metal fences to get out the venue</a>.</p>
      <p>Young <a href="http://bit.ly/2mQr72k">girls were left "traumatised"</a> as the crowd began to crush as they tried to leave.</p>
      <p>One mum said it <a href="http://bit.ly/2y40A7T">was a "free for all"</a> as <a href="http://bit.ly/2y40A7T">punters tried to exit the venue</a>.</p>
