      <p>Amid slogan shouting by opposition members, a bill to amend the Special Protection Group (SPG) Act was introduced in Lok Sabha on Monday by Minister of State for Home Affairs G Kishen Reddy.</p>
      <p>This comes days after the government withdrew the elite security cover provided to members of the Gandhi family.</p>
      <p>According to the proposed amendment, family members of former prime ministers would not be entitled to the coveted SPG security cover.</p>
      <p>Now elite SPG commandos will protect only the prime minister. They can also protect former prime ministers depending on the threat perception to them.</p>
