      <p>The wildfires torching southern Australia have wiped out much of the koala population, stoking fears that the national icon is getting closer to extinction.</p>
      <p>"In what is a national tragedy, the bushfires in and around Port Macquarie in November devastated a genetically diverse koala population," Port Macquarie Koala Hospital said.</p>
      <p>"As many as 350 koalas have perished, with approximately 75% of the fireground footprint being prime koala habitat."</p>
      <p>The hospital established a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-thirsty-koalas-devastated-by-recent-fires">GoFundMe account </a>to help affected koalas recuperate.</p>
      <p>The infernos have dealt a devastating blow to the koala population, which was <a href="https://www.australiazoo.com.au/conservation/programs/endangered-species/koala.php">already plummeting</a> prior to this month's wildfires.</p>
      <p>There are only about 40,000 to 100,000 koalas remaining after "uncontrolled habitat destruction," decimated the population, according to the Australia Zoo.</p>
      <p>In addition to bushfires, habitat clearing, dog attacks and road accidents, more than 2.5 million koalas have been killed to supply the fur trade in America and Europe, the zoo said.</p>
      <p>Koalas are now considered endangered, according to the <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/16892/21960344#population">International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species</a> .</p>
      <p>"We believe the wild population of koalas is critically threatened and in need of our protection," the Australia Zoo said.</p>
      <p>The human toll from the wildfires has also been immense.</p>
      <p>Four people have died and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/20/australia/south-australia-fires-record-temperatures-intl-hnk/index.html">hundreds of homes have been destroyed</a> .</p>
      <p>In New South Wales, which is home to nearly 8 million people, wildfires have already burnt an area <a href="https://cnn.com/australia/live-news/australia-fires-live-nov-12-intl-hnk/h_f42dcd97c7b06c849a85c4ae23e077d0">three times larger</a> than during the entire fire season last year.</p>
      <p>The infernos are fueled by soaring temperatures, fierce winds and the worst drought in decades have fueled the wildfires. Even worse: Summer in Australia doesn't even start until <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/glossary/seasons.shtml">December 1</a> .</p>
