      <p>As Nokia Mobile Twitter account teased the launch of a new Nokia smartphone <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/new-nokia-smartphone-to-be-launched-on-december-5/">on December 5</a>, many sites have been trying to cover it as the possible launch of <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/tag/nokia-8-2/">Nokia 8.2</a>. But as far as we know and the exlsuive sigthings reported by us reveal it will most probably be Nokia 2.3.</p>
      <p>We have now seen the official clear case listing for Nokia 2.3 (check the screenshot above) that claims that it will become available starting December 9. It is certainly not a coincidence that only Nokia 2.3 clear case is being made official soon after the December 5 launch.</p>
      <p>We have been reporting about HMDâ€™s plans to <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/exclusive-nokia-2-3-ta-1206-leaks-via-a-distributor-database-color-variants-mediatek-processor-revealed/">launch Nokia 2.3</a> with improved specs and features over Nokia 2.2. The leaked screenshot from distributor databse has also revealed Nokia 2.3 color variants.</p>
      <p>All these sightings hint at a sooner launch for the smartphones. Surprisingly there are no signs of any other Nokia smartphone including <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/tag/nokia-5-2/">Nokia 5.2</a> and <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/tag/nokia-9-1-pureview/">Nokia 9.1</a> anywhere.</p>
      <p>Nokia 2.3 may come with a display size of greater than 6.1-inch with HD resolution. It features a bigger battery of 3920 mAH capacity as compared to Nokia 2.2. Nokia 2.3 also comes with Bluetooth 5.0 as compared to Bluetooth 4.2 on Nokia 2.2.</p>
