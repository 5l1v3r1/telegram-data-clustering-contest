        <b>Gardaí have launched a murder investigation after a man was shot dead in Coolock, north Dublin on Sunday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The victim was named locally last night as Eoin Boylan.</p>
      <p>Boylan, 22, died at Beaumont Hospital after a "number of apparent gunshot wounds".</p>
      <p>The shooting took place on Clonshaugh Avenue in Dublin 17 at approximately 5:15pm on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Gardaí suspect that the murder is linked to the ongoing gang feud in Coolock.</p>
      <p>Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan has condemned the attack.</p>
      <p>“I was deeply concerned to hear of the shooting this evening in the Clonshaugh area. I condemn this wanton violence,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I urge anyone with information to please contact An Garda Síochána and assist them with their investigation.”</p>
      <p>Gardaí in Coolock opened a murder inquiry on Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>A Garda statement reads: “Members of the Garda Technical Bureau are currently examining the scene and an incident room has been established at Coolock Garda station.</p>
      <p>“The coroner has been notified and the services of the State Pathologist have been requested. Arrangements are being made for a postmortem examination.”</p>
      <p>Gardaí in Coolock have appealed for any witnesses to come forward.</p>
      <p>Any dashcam footage recorded in the vicinity of Clonshaugh Avenue between 4.30pm and 5.30pm on Sunday should be handed over to gardaí.</p>
