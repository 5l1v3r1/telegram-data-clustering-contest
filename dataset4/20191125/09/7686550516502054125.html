      <h1>What Zinedine Zidane said to Gareth Bale after he defied the Real Madrid boo boys</h1>
      <h2>Zidane wants the Real Madrid fans to lay off the Welshman</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:35:25+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:35</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Mitchelmore</a></address>
      <p>Zinedine Zidane has urged Real Madrid fans not to boo Gareth Bale following the Wales star's return to his club against Real Sociedad at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old started the game on the bench but was jeered by the home supporters when he replaced Rodrygo in the 65th minute.</p>
      <p>In addition to <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wales-gareth-bale-real-madrid-17307285">booing the Welshman</a> as he entered the fray, many jeered each time Bale touched the ball at the Santiago Bernabeu during Real Madrid's 3-1 win.</p>
      <p>It comes after Bale danced with the now iconic <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wales-euro-2020-gareth-bale-17284390">"Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order" flag</a> following Wales' stunning 2-0 win over Hungary, a result that saw Ryan Giggs' men qualify for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>And while Zidane admits he hasn't spoken to Bale about the booing, the manager has called on the Madridistas to lay off the Wales star.</p>

      <p>"What we want is for our fans to be with us from start to finish, but we have no control over that," said the Frenchman.</p>
      <p>"The fans can do as they please, but let's not focus on the jeers. Bale came on and did very well, he had a good 20 minutes, but let's focus on the win and the three points."</p>
      <p>After Bale's superb cameo, Zidane revealed he only had positive words for the Welshman, adding: "I congratulated Bale on his performance, as I did all of the players. I haven't spoken to him about the jeers. It's something that has happened to the best players in the past and today it's Bale's turn.</p>
      <p>"He came on and did very well and, at the end of the day, we need our fans to get behind us. That's all there is to say.</p>
      <p>"It won't affect things because it's something that's always happened and it'll happen to many of them.</p>
      <p>"What we've got to do is keep working hard and delivering on the pitch, because what the fans want to see is that their team keep on winning.</p>
      <p>"I can't say whether it's unfair or not. Everyone's entitled to their opinion and has to make a decision about what they say on it.</p>
      <p>"The important thing in this is us and what we need. As I said yesterday, we need our fans, I can't control things, nor can Bale or anybody else. We always need our fans' backing because they give us that boost.</p>
      <p>"I spoke about that ahead of the game. There's lots of talking that goes on, too much. All he wants is to be part of things and he was tonight, but there's no need to be talking about it so much.</p>
      <p>"What I can say is that he's integrated within the group, wants to play and we're going to carry on without letting this affect us."</p>
      <p>Bale suffered a calf injury late on in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wales-croatia-gareth-bale-cardiff-17075623">Wales' 1-1 draw with Croatia</a> in October and did not play a single minute of football for Real Madrid before making his return to action for his country against <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/azerbaijan-v-wales-live-kick-17268321">Azerbaijan</a> earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Former Real Madrid player Predrag Mijatovic criticised Bale's love of golf following his lengthy absence.</p>

      <p>In a column for Spanish media outlet AS, he wrote: "The first thing he thinks about is Wales, then golf and after that, Real Madrid."</p>
      <p>It went on to become a new chant, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/genius-new-gareth-bale-chant-17269089">with the Red Wall belting out "Wales. Golf. Madrid."</a> to the tune of Viva Gareth Bale during the wins against Azerbaijan and Hungary.</p>
      <p>The slogan was also stuck on to a <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wales-euro-2020-gareth-bale-17284390">flag</a> that managed to find its way on to the pitch after the historic win against Hungary at Cardiff City Stadium.</p>
