      <p>The murder victim is known to the ­Gardai and it is believed the ­brutal attack is linked to an ­ongoing feud in the Coolock area.</p>
      <p>Paramedics and gardai rushed to the scene, where they worked to save the man’s life at the scene.</p>
      <p>He was rushed to Beaumont Hospital, where he was last night pronounced dead by medics.</p>
      <p>Armed cops last night closed off the shooting scene where forensic and technical examinations were set to be carried out.</p>

      <p>Gardai believe that Boylan was attacked by at least two gunmen, who fled the scene in a car.</p>
      <p>The Irish Sun understands he was aware that his life was under threat before yesterday’s attack.</p>
      <p>It is believed cops recently thwarted a hit on Boylan after they stopped a vehicle and seized a gun.</p>
      <p>They’re probing whether Boylan was targeted by associates of slain drug dealer Sean Little.</p>
      <p>He was found <a href="https://www.thesun.ie/news/4126285/man-killed-shooting-walshestown-sean-little/">riddled beside a burning car in Balbriggan in May</a>.</p>
      <h3>COOLOCK FEUD</h3>
      <p>Little was whacked just 24 hours after another pal was shot dead in Darndale and months after close friend Zach Parker was<a href="https://www.thesun.ie/news/3644234/zach-parker-shot-dead-swords-shooting/"> gunned down outside a gym in Swords</a>.</p>
      <p>The Coolock feud has seen a major escalation in the last few months with tit-for-tat incidents, including drive by shootings and houses targeted by fire bombs.</p>
      <p>Another theory last night being probed is that Boylan’s murder may be linked to the Drogheda feud.</p>
      <p>It’s believed Boylan was also playing a role in the dispute which has been ongoing since July 2018.</p>
      <p>Local councillor Alison Gilliland, who lives just up the road from last night’s shooting, told the Irish Sun residents are terrified.</p>
      <h3>'NERVOUSNESS IN AREA'</h3>
      <p>She said: “This is a quiet settled area but that road is busy and there’s always people going up and down it.</p>
      <p>"One of them could have been injured or even worse.</p>
      <p>“It’s always very concerning to hear gun shots outside your own window or your own door.</p>
      <p>“There is a lot of nervousness in the area about where is the next incident is going to be.</p>
      <p>People are saying, ‘Could I be walking along the footpath when it happens or my kids or anyone from my family and then they’re accidentally hit from a stray bullet or something’.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Racheal Batten added: “The worst part of it is that it is not shocking and there will be children walking to school tomorrow morning past Garda tape and asking what happened.</p>
      <h3>'CONDEMN THIS WANTON VIOLENCE'</h3>
      <p>Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan last night condemned the killing.</p>
      <p>He said: “I was deeply concerned to hear of the shooting in the Clonshaugh area. I condemn this wanton ­violence.</p>
      <p>"I urge anyone with ­information to please contact An Garda Siochana and assist them with their investigation.</p>
      <p>“Anyone with information should contact Coolock Garda Station at 01 666 4200 or the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666 111.”</p>
