      <h1>Des Cahill says former Sunday Game co-host Grainne Seoige comforted him when he cried on set</h1>
      <h2>"I get emotional too easily with sport but it is not good when you are a broadcaster because your voice goes high"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:29:37+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:29</time> by <a rel="author">Mikie O'Loughlin</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/des-cahill">Des Cahill</a> told how his former Sunday Game co-host <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/grainne-seoige">Grainne Seoige</a> was a great emotional support to him during their time together on the show.</p>
      <p>He said that she had great empathy both as a broadcaster and as a person.</p>
      <p>Recalling how she held his hand as he cried during poignant moment, he told the Irish Sunday Mirror: "I remember Joe McDonagh, a former GAA President and player, sang The West Awake unaccompanied.</p>
      <p>"It is a powerful song and he had a powerful strong voice and Grainne sensed I was getting emotional and she squeezed my hand."</p>
      <p>She knew that I had tears and I couldn’t talk even though I had my back to her and I will never forget it.</p>
      <p>"I get emotional too easily with sport but it is not good when you are a broadcaster because your voice goes high."</p>

      <p>Grainne left the lifestyle sports show and she and Des haven't seen each other since, <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/news/celebs/des-cahill-grainne-seoige-emotional-20931595">RSVP Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>He said: "Grainne was great and I haven’t had a chance to say it to anybody. I don’t get to see her because she is in South Africa.</p>
      <p>"Grainne had an empathy and she got me."</p>
      <p>The RTE also saw Michael Lyster leave The Sunday Game after turning 65 last year and Des said that it is sad to see his colleagues and friends go after working together for so long.</p>
      <p>Des said: "I was aware it was going to happen (Michael Lyster retiring). As a friend and colleague, we had many common interests so we had a lot to chat about.</p>

      <p>"We have had a big turn over in the sports department, Jimmy Magee and Mícheál Ó Muircheartaigh are gone so there has been a high turnover of staff.</p>
      <p>"Even some of the producers have changed.</p>
      <p>"Changes are inevitable in organisations like RTE but Michael and I will be meeting for a pint over Christmas."</p>
      <p>With talk of cuts rife at the national broadcaster, Des confirmed that he has no plans to leave just yet, as long as RTE will still have him.</p>
      <p>He explained: "RTE will decide if I stay put or not but I have no thoughts about retiring. I am a bit younger than the other lads so it hasn’t come into my vision yet."</p>
