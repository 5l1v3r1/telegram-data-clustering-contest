      <p>An Australian man and New Zealand woman got married 34,000 feet in the air between their home nations, because they said they couldn’t decide on a venue.</p>
      <p>David Valliant and his New Zealand bride Cathy Rolfe got married halfway between Australia and New Zealand on flight 201 of Australian budget airline Jetstar. The video of the wedding was posted on Jetstar’s YouTube channel, and it went viral soon.</p>

      <p>According to <i>CNN</i>, Valliant and Rolfe met online in 2011 while playing an aviation-linked game online, and met in person only in 2013. The airline agreed to Rolfe’s special request after she reportedly approached Jetstar on their <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/facebook/">Facebook</a> page.</p>
      <p>Rolfe walked down the aisle of the aircraft on October 9, while Valliant waited at the front of the aircraft. The airline staff had also arranged for the wedding party to sit in the front rows of the plane, while other passengers were seated further back.</p>
