      <p>The owner of a missing Jack Russell was filmed breaking down in tears after his dog was found in a fox hole.</p>
      <p>Alan Whitton, 49, had taken Mitzi for a walk around Knighton Wood, on Buckhurst Hill, on Wednesday morning when she was chased by a Basset Hound and disappeared.</p>
      <p>He then spent the day frantically searching for her, eventually leaving the area at 6.30pm, before returning again an hour later.</p>

      <p>Terrified that she had been ‘savaged’, he continued to scour the woods on Thursday and Friday, before being forced to take a break and do a food shop at Aldi.</p>
      <p>It was then around 11am that he received a call from another dog walker who said their pet had been sniffing around a fox hole in the woods.</p>

      <p>Alan, a life therapy coach, said he ‘dropped everything and went to investigate’, taking one of Mitzi’s toys to squeak outside the hole.</p>
      <p>He was then stunned to hear a faint whimper in return and decided to furiously start digging on the spot, with the help of the woman who rang him.</p>
      <p>At 1.13pm he was reunited with Mitzi – more than 50 hours after she went missing.</p>
      <p>In a video of the moment, Alan can be seen pulling the dog out and then clutching her to his chest as he breaks down in floods of tears.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.essexlive.news/news/essex-news/essex-familys-hell-dog-gets-3571435">Essex Live</a>: ‘I just broke down, I was overwhelmed with joy and disbelief, I had started to lose hope.</p>

      <p>‘It was like a Christmas miracle, all the time it felt like a nightmare I couldn’t wake up from.’</p>
      <p>Fortunately Mitzi was unharmed by the ordeal and only need a few ticks removed after a trip to the vets.</p>

      <p>Alan said the first thing she did once free was ‘smash her way through a Greggs vegan sausage roll’.</p>
      <p>He is now going to buy her a GPS collar so he can track her during their walks together.</p>
      <p>Thanking residents in the area for their help, Alan said losing Mitzi has taught him ‘not to take anything for granted’ and to ‘love big and love hard’.</p>
      <p>He is now offering free coaching sessions for anyone involved in her rescue, as they ‘restored’ his faith in humanity.</p>
