      <h1>Tesla passes 200,000 Cybertruck orders within 3 days of launch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:22:47+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://venturebeat.com/author/reuters/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>(<i>Reuters</i>) — Tesla CEO Elon Musk indicated <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198788116372344832">in a tweet</a> on Sunday that the electric carmaker received 200,000 orders for its electric pickup truck within three days of its launch.</p>
      <p>Musk, who has been regularly tweeting about the Cybertruck’s features since its launch late Thursday, has also been updating his followers with the number of orders the company has received.</p>
      <p>In an earlier tweet, Musk said the company had received 146,000 orders for the Cybertruck, and he tweeted again on Sunday saying “200K” — an apparent reference to the number of orders.</p>
      <p>The company’s website shows that an immediate payment of $100 is required to reserve an order for the Cybertruck, which has a starting price of $39,900.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/22/tesla-unveils-electric-pickup-truck-with-angular-design-and-armored-glass/">launch of the futuristic pickup on Thursday</a> suffered a setback when the electric vehicle’s “armored glass” windows shattered in a much-anticipated unveiling. The overall look of the electric vehicle had worried Wall Street on Friday, driving the automaker’s shares to close 6.1% lower.</p>
      <p>During the launch, Musk had taken aim at the design, power, and durability of mainstream trucks, only to be shaken when his boast about his new vehicle’s windows backfired.</p>
      <p>Separately, Musk said the Cybertruck is Tesla’s last product unveil for a while.</p>
      <p>Tesla plans to start manufacturing the Cybertruck around late 2021.</p>
