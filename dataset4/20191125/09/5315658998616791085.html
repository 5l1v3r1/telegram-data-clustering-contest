      <p>The truck hit the bridge on Titirangi Road between Margan Avenue and Great North Road just before 8.30am this morning.</p>
      <p>Auckland Transport says trains cannot run over the bridge until it has been inspected.</p>
      <p>It's encouraging commuters to take buses instead.</p>
      <p>"A rail shuttle is currently operating between Swanson and Henderson and vice versa, so customers can connect to scheduled bus services at Henderson," Auckland Transport said on Twitter.</p>
