      <h2>Cloud-based casual gaming platform looks towards partnership development</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:56:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/?author=1708" target="_blank">Haydn Taylor</a></address>
      <p>Cloud-based casual gaming platform AirConsole has closed a Series A funding round worth $3 million.</p>
      <p>Led by Ringier Digital Ventures, funds will be used to grow the AirConsole game library and develop partnerships with TV operators and manufactures.</p>
      <p>Founded in 2015 by a former Google employee, AirConsole allows players to game through their laptop or AndroidTV using a smartphone as a controller, requiring no additional hardware or software.</p>
      <p>AirConsole currently boasts over 150 games and five million players. This year has seen over one million hours of gaming played on the platform.</p>
      <p>"Digital casual gaming is a huge trend globally and TV set-top box operators are looking for new ways to differentiate themselves from competition and to stay relevant," said Thomas Kaiser from Ringier Digital Ventres.</p>
      <p>"AirConsole is a fantastic opportunity for these partners and will give AirConsole's game publishers a boost in audience for their games."</p>
      <p>AirConsoles comes pre-installed on 1.5 million SwisscomTV set-top boxes, and founder Andrin von Rechenberg is looking to extend this arrangement to other operators and manufactures.</p>
