      <p>Jeremiah Lee may come from a small high school, but last week he received a big honor.</p>
      <p>Lee, a graduate of Grace Academy High School who is now a senior central defender for the Western Washington University men’s soccer team, was named the Great Northwest Athletic Conference Defender of the Year.</p>
      <p>Lee, who also was named to the NCAA Division II Conference Commissioners Association All-West Region first team, anchored a Vikings defense that allowed just 14 goals during its 18 regular season games as Western claimed the GNAC championship.</p>
      <p>Lee was joined on the All-GNAC first team by his central defensive partner at Western, Glacier Peak High School graduate Camron Miller, who is a junior. Miller was a second-team All-West Region choice.</p>
      <p>Snohomish High School graduate Jason Fairhurst, a junior forward at Saint Martin’s, was an honorable mention All-GNAC selection.</p>
      <p>Magnus named second-team All-Pac-12</p>
      <p>Snohomish High School graduate John Magnus, now a senior midfielder on the University of Washington men’s soccer team, was named to the All-Pac-12 second team. Magnus anchors central midfield for a Huskies team that went 15-3 during the regular season, won the Pac-12 championship, and earned the No. 6 seed to the NCAA tournament. The Huskies advanced to the Sweet 16 by beating Boston College 2-0 Sunday.</p>
      <p>Haller earns cross country All-America honors</p>
      <p>Edmonds-Woodway High School graduate Miler Haller, now a senior on the Boise State University men’s cross country team, earned All-American status with his performance at the NCAA National Championships on Saturday in Terre Haute, Indiana. Haller finished 30th in the 10-kilometer race in a time of 31 minutes, 12.9 seconds. Fellow Edmonds-Woodway grad Yukino Parle, a sophomore on the Broncos’ women’s team, was Boise State’s top finisher at nationals as she completed the 6-kilometer race in a time of 21:09.1 to place 83rd.</p>
      <p>Edmonds CC places three on All-Region teams</p>
      <p>The Edmonds Community College volleyball team had three players named to the Northwest Athletic Conference All-North Region teams.</p>
      <p>The Tritons, who went 1-2 at the NWAC tournament on Thursday through Sunday in Tacoma, placed sophomore outside hitter Sadie Gardner and sophomore setter Haylee Hooper on the first team, while freshman middle blocker Danika Brown was named to the second team. Gardner was also named a third-team American Volleyball Coaches Association NWAC All-American, one of six players from NWAC to make the three teams.</p>
      <p>Monroe High School graduate Alexis Carpenter, a freshman defensive specialist at Whatcom, was also a second-team All-North Region selection. Lakewood High School graduate Sidney Goodell, whose Pierce Raiders finished as NWAC runners-up, was a second-team All-West Region pick.</p>
