      <p>An 82-year-old grandmother found herself in danger when an intruder broke into her house, but she made him regret it.</p>
      <p>Willie Murphy said she was getting ready for bed on Thursday night when a man began knocking on her door, asking her to call an ambulance for him.</p>
      <p>She called the police but did not let the man in, however he became angry and broke through the door.</p>
      <p>Willie, who is an award-winning bodybuilder, was scared but decided to act quickly.</p>
      <p>"It's kind of semi-dark and I'm alone, and I'm old. But guess what, I'm tough," she said.</p>
      <p>"He picked the wrong house to break into."</p>

      <p>The 82-year-old used household items to attack the intruder, beginning with her own table, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/24/us/82-year-old-bodybuilder-grandma-intruder-trnd/index.html?fbclid=IwAR2Ik-kZOnVXKr1KhogaKIYtXzxYjBP469gc6-nTvmMVmpUM0mxR6Ff3cNg">CNN</a> reports.</p>
      <p>"I took that table and I went to work on him," she said. "And guess what? The table broke."</p>
      <p>She said she also used the metal legs of the table to keep hitting him.</p>

      <p>After jumping on the man a couple times, Willie went to the kitchen, grabbed a bottle of baby shampoo and started pouring it on the man's face as he tried to get up.</p>
      <p>She added she then took a broom and hit the man again.</p>
      <p>Willie said, even though she can lift 225 pounds, she struggled to drag the man out of the house because he was "dead weight".</p>
      <p>At that point, the police arrived to the property in Rochester, New York, in response to the woman's earlier call.</p>

      <p>"So they come in," she said. "He's laying down already because I had really did a number on that man. I'm serious."</p>
      <p>The intruder was then put in an ambulance and sent to hospital.</p>
      <p>"I think he was happy when he went in the ambulance because I sent him in the ambulance. Yes, I did," she said.</p>
