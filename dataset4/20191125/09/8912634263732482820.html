      <p>TEHRAN: Iran on Monday rejected a US court order for Tehran to pay $180 million in damages to a Washington Post reporter for jailing him on espionage charges.<br/>Jason Rezaian spent 544 days in an Iranian prison before he was released in January 2016 in exchange for seven Iranians held in the United States.<br/>On Friday, a US district court judge ordered damages be paid to Rezaian and his family in compensation for pain and suffering as well as economic losses.<br/>The Iranian foreign ministry’s spokesman described the journalist’s decision to seek damages as “strange.”<br/>“Mr Jason Rezaian... was a security convict and the Islamic Republic of Iran commuted his (sentence of maximum punishment) to imprisonment,” said spokesman Abbas Mousavi.<br/>“He was pardoned and despite having an open case ... he was released,” Mousavi told a news conference in Tehran.<br/>“For him to go there and lodge a complaint and for American courts to lavishly determine such figures” was a course of action that Iran “rejects,” said Mousavi.<br/>“This was a favor that the Islamic Republic of Iran did for him,” he said, adding that he could have been kept behind bars and punished more severely.<br/>Mousavi said Iran could itself take similar legal action against the United States, without elaborating.<br/>Relations between arch-foes Tehran and Washington plunged to a new low in May last year when the US withdrew from an international accord that gave Iran relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear program.<br/>Rezaian and three other Americans were released on January 16, 2016, the day the nuclear agreement entered into force.</p>
