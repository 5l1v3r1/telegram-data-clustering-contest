      <h1>Dow Ignores Pricing in US-China 'Phase 2' Trade Deal Fallout</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>Reports suggest that a phase two deal between the U.S. and China could fall apart, causing Dow Jones rally to fade.</li>
        <li>China’s economy is declining and U.S. is still at risk of recession, leaving both countries in favor of a deal.</li>
        <li>European markets seem to be pricing in difficulties around the talks, showing confidence from investors towards a successful phase two deal.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Despite reports about the <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-china-phasetwo/no-phase-two-u-s-china-deal-on-the-horizon-officials-say-idUKKBN1XZ00H">potential fall out of a phase two deal</a> with China, pre-markets data indicate the <a href="https://www.ccn.com/dow-futures-rise-as-us-china-trade-verbal-attacks/">Dow Jones is set to open at 27,943</a>, up 94 points from Friday’s close.</p>
      <p>Behind the strong momentum of the Dow Jones is likely the expectations of investors that the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/china-says-external-rumors-about-the-trade-talks-are-not-accurate.html">trade talks will continue to see progress</a> in the short term.</p>
      <h3>Trade deal confidence boosts markets; but is it misguided?</h3>
      <p>The U.S. and China have long struggled on key issues such as industrial policy reforms and the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-24/china-to-raise-penalties-on-ip-rights-violations">protection of intellectual property</a>.</p>
      <p>Unresolved discussions around the sensitive areas of the deal have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/11/22/jim-cramer-trump-wants-to-string-out-trade-talks-as-more-us-companies-move-away-from-china.html">eventually delayed the signing of a phase one deal</a>, which is yet to be finalized.</p>
      <p>Still, markets in the U.S. and Europe seem to have priced in the difficulties surrounding a phase two agreement, as shown by the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/25/european-markets-set-to-open-higher-amid-us-china-trade-hopes.html">recent rally of the Dow Jones and the DAX</a>.</p>

      <p>According to Bloomberg, the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-16/as-china-s-economy-slows-why-the-world-should-care-quicktake?srnd=premium-asia">economy of China has been recording slowing growth</a> throughout 2019. In August, China saw its worst single month industrial output growth since 2002.</p>
      <p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-16/china-s-economy-slows-as-industrial-output-weaker-than-expected">chief Greater China economist Helen Qiao said</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>In terms of policy room, we still think there’s quite a lot for both the Ministry of Finance and the PBOC, but now it’s a matter of whether they want to use it. What I worry about is that policy makers are hesitating at the moment because of the potential implications on the long term impact, so they’re really fallen behind the curve.</blockquote>
      <p>With China’s central bank <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-facing-slowdown-still-unlikely-to-push-for-more-stimulus-11570971601">cautious in introducing more stimuli</a> to control the long term growth of the nation, in the short term, China is expected to see slowing growth ahead.</p>

      <p>The declining economy of China will <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-trade-war-tariffs-china-bijing-political-defense-opportunity-2019-11">affect how the government proceeds</a> with the completion of a phase one deal, and a phase two deal that is set to follow.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones unaffected, priced in difficulties</h3>
      <p>Since U.S. President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-announces-phase-one-trade-deal-china-n1065221">announced an agreement on a phase one deal</a> on October 12, both China and the U.S. have said that the signing of the first deal would swiftly lead to the second.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-china-phasetwo/no-phase-two-u-s-china-deal-on-the-horizon-officials-say-idUKKBN1XZ00H">Trump administration official told</a> Reuters:</p>
      <blockquote>As soon as we finish phase one we’re going to start negotiating phase two. As far as timing around when a phase two deal could be completed, that’s not something I can speculate on.</blockquote>
      <p>Although the <a href="https://www.ccn.com/dow-rises-despite-snowballing-fears-that-trump-wont-deliver/">trade talks have lagged for nearly a month</a>, the Dow Jones and the global equities market show that <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-forecast-rally-only-first-inning-morgan-stanley-md-2019-11-1028713146">investors are confident both countries have sufficient incentives to achieve a dea</a>l by the year’s end.</p>

      <p>Without a trade deal, the GDP of China is speculated to fall by at least 6%. Janet Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chair, said that the U.S. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/yellen-good-reason-to-worry-about-us-economy-sliding-into-recession.html">could fall into recession with or without a deal</a>, making the agreement important for both countries.</p>
