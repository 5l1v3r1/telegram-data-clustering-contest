      <p>Krushna Abhishek is back as the host of OMG! Yeh Mera India season 6. The factual entertainment show presents extraordinary stories of ordinary Indians. The 10-episode series airs every Monday at 8 pm on History TV18.</p>
      <p>Krushna, who is also seen in The <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/kapil-sharma">Kapil Sharma</a> Show, playing the hilarious Sapna, recently sat down for an exclusive chat with <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a> about hosting the latest season of OMG! Yeh Mera India. The actor also opened up about his sister Arti Singh, who is presently locked in the Bigg Boss 13 house. While applauding her efforts, Krushna also mentioned that he will never participate in the controversial show.</p>
      <p>Excerpts from the conversation:</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. What can we expect from OMG! Yeh Mera India 6?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Honestly, it’s one of my most favourite shows. Everywhere I go, people keep chanting ‘OMG OMG’, even when I am on stage for another show. The entire team works really hard to bring some interesting facts about people from across the country. Every time I read the script, I am amazed by the research. I am sure the audience loves it too. In this season too, the audience will be treated to a lot of surprising elements.</p>

      <p>
        <b>2. Do you feel the surprise factor has worked in favour of the show?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Of course, the shock value works for us. Also, I feel the audience can get so much knowledge about India through our show. We cover places that are not even on maps, and the talent that we bring to the forefront is just amazing. I still remember this story we did on floating houses. Who would have known that we could have something like this in our country? Even though I am born and brought up in Mumbai, I was unaware of so many of its facts. I think parents should definitely get their kids to watch our show.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Acting or hosting – what do you enjoy more?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Acting. However, this show is an exception. I cannot see myself on stage doing buffoonery while a contestant sings or dances. I have been offered every show on television right now but I never accepted it. OMG is different as I get to be the narrator and also have a lot of fun.</p>

        <b>4. Your sister Arti Singh is locked up inside the Bigg Boss 13 house. What do you have to say about her performance?</b>
      </p>
      <p>When I went to drop her on the day of launch, I did tell her that you should stand up for yourself. I think she took me too seriously as we saw her telling someone that my brother told me that I can hit someone and get evicted, he will pay the Rs 2 crore penalty (laughs). I was like why will you say that? But otherwise, she is doing really well. The house is such that people tend to get cranky and aggressive. For example Sidharth Shukla, I have met him earlier and he is a nice guy. But he is coming across as quite disrespectful, especially when it comes to girls.</p>

        <b>5. Do you feel that’s the reason Arti is slowly moving out of the group?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, and she should have done that long back. Honestly, I thought she will get eliminated in the first two weeks, but she has done really well. Also, I know if she will ever go wrong, Salman bhai is also there to bring her back on the right path. I consider him family and I had told him to be strict with her when needed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>6. Since Arti survived many nominations, do you think she can win the show?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I do want her to win the show. You would feel that she is my sister and so I am naming her but the show is such that an underdog might just race ahead in the final days. You never know what connects well with the audience.</p>
      <p>
        <b>7. While your sister and even wife Kashmera Shah has been part of Bigg Boss, will we ever see you participating in the show?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bigg Boss is not my cup of tea. I am like a woman, especially in the morning. I bathe for more than an hour and take my own sweet time to get ready. No one will tolerate that in the house. Also, I am very patient and even when someone is abusing me, I will not even flinch. But if I come to react, I will breakdown the house and jump out. So it’s better that I don’t participate.</p>
