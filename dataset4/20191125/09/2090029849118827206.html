      <p>However, LASEPA’s General Manager, Dr Adedolapo Fasawe warned the public, particularly unrepentant noise polluters to desist from the act of attacking its officials while discharging their duties or face the full wrath of the Law.</p>
      <p>Fasawe observed with dismay the frequent attacks of the officials and obstruction of same from carrying out their official duties by unidentified hoodlums hired by facility owners to prevent lawful application of the law, saying that the law enforcement agents all over the world were not always in the good book of offenders, whose primary aim was to subvert law and pervert cause of justice at all cost.</p>

      <p>She added that officials of the agency were attacked by hoodlums at the Westgate Louge, Omole and Sky Louge, Oko Oba while performing their duty to shut down the facilities for their persistent noise and failure to operate within the ambit of the law.</p>
      <p>According to her, negative consequences awaited these perpetrators as the officials represented the government and whose motive was to protect the interest of the society against interest of few self centred defaulters.</p>
