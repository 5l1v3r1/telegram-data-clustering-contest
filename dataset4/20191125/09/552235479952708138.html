      <p>A drugged-up motorist sparked terror during a high speed police chase through Paisley.</p>
      <p>Joseph McGowan, 43, sped along the wrong side of the road forcing drivers to swerve out of his path, and even spun his car around, leaving him facing oncoming vehicles during the pursuit.</p>
      <p>Paisley Sheriff Court heard McGowan, witnessed to be under the influence of drugs, caused traffic mayhem when officers on mobile patrol spotted him at the wheel of his Ford Fiesta.</p>

      <p>Procurator Fiscal Depute Maureen McGovern told the court: “Officers followed the Ford Fiesta driven by the accused when they recognised him.</p>
      <p>“Police had reason to speak to him and decided to follow.</p>
      <p>“They observed the accused rapidly increasing his speed to the point where police lost sight of the vehicle.</p>
      <p>“They looked around for the accused and observed him driving out of Sunnylaw Drive onto Brediland Drive where they activated their blue lights and sirens.</p>
      <p>“The accused responded by again rapidly increasing his speed, overtaking oncoming vehicles approaching a blind summit and junction.</p>
      <p>“He continued speeding far in excess of the 30mph speed limit again overtaking oncoming vehicles, which had to break sharply to avoid <br/>collision.”</p>
      <p>The court heard McGowan continued to tear through the streets of Foxbar on July 4 with cops in hot pursuit until he completely lost control of Fiesta, spinning 180 degrees, with his motor on the opposite carriageway facing oncoming traffic.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor added: “The distance between the accused and the police vehicle increased significantly.</p>
      <p>“The accused attempted to turn right but due to his <br/>excessive speed and rapid braking, lost control causing his vehicle to spin round 180 degrees with the vehicle coming to rest facing the wrong way on the opposite carriageway.</p>
      <p>“He then continued driving pursued by police until he pulled over at Brediland Road where he quickly alighted from the vehicle but was arrested.</p>
      <p>“It was immediately apparent he was heavily under the influence of substances.</p>
      <p>“He was talking incoherently.</p>
      <p>“His eyes were bloodshot and glazed.”</p>
      <p>He was taken to Greenock Police Station where he refused to provide officers with a blood sample.</p>
      <p>McGowan of Brediland Road, Foxbar, pleaded guilty to charges of dangerous driving, failing to stop when required to by police, driving while unfit to do so, refusing to provide a blood sample and driving without insurance.</p>
      <p>Defence agent Anthony Boland said he would reserving his submissions in defence of McGowan until after the court had obtained background reports in preparation for sentencing.</p>
      <p>Sheriff James Spy warned McGowan, who has previous convictions for both motoring and drugs offences, that was he was being released on bail until December 13.</p>
      <p>He said: “These are serious charges.</p>
      <p>“It should not be taken that there will be a non-custodial sentence.”</p>
