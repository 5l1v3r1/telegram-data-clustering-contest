      <p>Stats NZ seeks feedback on the New Zealand standard classification of ethnicity</p>
      <p>
        <b>25 November 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p>We are asking New Zealanders for their views on the New Zealand standard classification of ethnicity, Stats NZ said today.</p>
      <p>The three-week consultation begins on Monday 25 November and ends at 5pm on Friday 13 December 2019.</p>
      <p>Ethnicity is a key social factor used with other topics in describing the New Zealand population. Information collected on ethnicity is used to inform, plan, and evaluate services and policies by a wide range of organisations, local authorities and government agencies.</p>
      <p>“We’ve already captured and collated some feedback from past enquiries, but we want to make sure all potential issues have been identified,” data and statistical standard manager Ashleigh Maw said.</p>
      <p>Ethnicity is the ethnic group or groups that people identify with or feel they belong to. Ethnicity is a measure of cultural affiliation, as opposed to race, ancestry, nationality or citizenship. Ethnicity is self-perceived, and people can belong to more than one ethnic group.</p>
      <p>Feedback from the public consultation will enable Stats NZ to examine the full extent of all issues to ensure quality and relevance.</p>
      <p>“We’d like to have a comprehensive register of all issues associated with the ethnicity classification completed in the first quarter of next year,” Ms Maw said.</p>
      <p>“We will then know if we need to refresh the ethnicity classification or if a full review is required.”</p>
      <p>A primary purpose of a standard classification is to provide simplification of the real world and a useful framework for collecting and analysing data from both statistical and administrative collections.</p>
      <p>The current classification was created in 2005. In 2017, a category refresh was undertaken prior to the 2018 Census. This consultation seeks clarification around any issues associated with this classification.</p>
