      <p>President of Kaduna Polo Club Suleiman Abubakar has described the  top players recently decorated  with the Blue Jacket  on the occasion of the  recently concluded  Georgian Cup Centenary as the authentic heroes of the game.</p>
      <p>Apart from  teams like Rubicon and EL-Amin that carted away trophies, the off-the-pitch  highlight  of the  well-attended polo fiesta  was the Legends Award Gala that paraded impressive awardees who were unanimously thrilled by the honours from both the Kaduna Polo Club and title sponsors, First Bank Plc, for recognizing their immense contribution to  the popularity of the Georgian Cup.</p>
      <p>Those decorated with the Blue Jackets on the night of legends include Nigeria’s top rated professional Bello Buba who has won the Georgian Cup a record 18 times as well as Bala Shehu Shagari, Amani Idi, Mohammad Babangida, Kashim Bukar, Adamu Yaro and Dawule Baba.</p>
      <p>Others are Senator Hadi Sirika, Ibrahim Mohammed, Jamilu Mohammed, Babangida Hassan and the President of Kaduna Polo Club, Suleiman Abubakar who has won the cup four times with three different teams.</p>
      <p>The Blue Jacket recipients were particularly elated about the award, urging Kaduna Polo Club to make the award ceremony an annual event as an encouragement that would propel upcoming and future generations to aspire to the top in their polo careers.</p>
      <p>“I am proud and humbled to celebrate this wonderful landmark which would not have been possible without efforts of our esteem sponsors  especially First Bank,”  stated Abubakar.</p>
      <p>“Through the last 100 years what’s remained consistent is the high standard of polo that we have witnessed being played at the club and the commitment of everybody involved.</p>
      <p>“I look forward to many, many more exciting years of polo and on building the mutual trust and</p>
      <p>friendship among the polo fraternity that we share,” he enthused .</p>
