        <b>Despite the cancellation of P.T/Silent Hills and the shifting focus towards Death Stranding, game director Hideo Kojima hasn’t given up on creating horror games. In fact, Hideo Kojima wants to make “the scariest horror game”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Even with the memory of Silent Hills fresh in everyone’s minds, Kojima is still adamant that he will create the world’s scariest horror game.</p>
      <p>With Death Stranding out in the wild and playable on PS4 –<a href="https://mspoweruser.com/death-stranding-steam-epic-games-store/">with a PC port in the works</a> – Kojima is ready to move onto his next project. It’s probably horror themed.</p>
      <p>“As to make the scariest horror game, I’ll watch the scary movies in order to awaken my horror soul,” <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1197880438603145216?s=20">Kojima wrote on Twitter</a>. “THE EYE is the Thai horror movie I rent when making PT but was too scary to finish watching. The package is scary so I rented the disc only. Will I be able to finish watching?”</p>

      <p>Whether Kojima will be able to fulfill his goal of making the scariest horror video game ever or not, a AAA horror game would be great to see again. Hopefully, the director will be able to bring on the original creative team for Silent Hills, a team consisting of Kojima, Guillermo Del Toro and Junji Ito.</p>
      <p>All we know is this: Kojima is renting a DVD in 2019 and that’s absolutely toilet-makingly terrifying.</p>
