      <h1>Tottenham should use Zlatan’s next move to bring in Rafael Leao</h1>
      <h2>Tottenham Hotspur should seriously consider a move for the Portuguese attacker in January.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:15:57+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>The future of Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been up in the air recently, after he revealed he would not be signing an extension with LA Galaxy. </p>
      <p>The Swedish striker has been linked with a host of clubs since, including recent reports of potential interest from Tottenham Hotspur. </p>
      <p>This is likely due to Jose Mourinho’s recent appointment at the club. The pair have worked together before and, <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/mourinho-called-striker-convince-return-pl-potential-golden-opportunity-january/">according to La Repubblica, as relayed by Sport Witness, </a>contact has been made. </p>
      <p>But a report from<a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/milan-ibrahimovic-fa-fuori-piatek-o-leao-ipotesi-prestito-le-str-27174"> Calciomercato is suggesting</a> Zlatan is not interested in a Spurs move. He would not want to play second fiddle to Harry Kane and a move back to AC Milan is still the most likely course of action. </p>

      <p>If that is the case, then Tottenham Hotspur should be looking at a player who would suffer as a consequence.</p>
      <p>The report from CM suggests that Zlatan’s arrival would see Milan let either Krzysztof Piatek or Rafael Leao leave on loan. </p>
      <p>Leao only joined Milan in the summer in a<a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/en/news/revealed-how-much-ac-milan-paid-for-rafael-leao-10241"> reported (Calciomercato) €28 million (£24m) deal </a>from Lille. He is therefore already known to knew Tottenham coaching staff members Joao Sacramento and Nuno Santos. </p>
      <p>Leao is also represented by Jorge Mendes, Mourinho’s long-time agent and friend, which would give Tottenham extra leverage in any move for the player. </p>
      <p>Whilst some fans would love to see Zlatan at Tottenham it seems he is on his way to Milan. However, that could free up Leao and Tottenham have every reason to take that opportunity.</p>
