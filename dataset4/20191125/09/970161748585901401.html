      <p>The Met Office has issued a ‘danger to life’ flood warning as storm Sebastien heads to the UK.</p>
      <p>Rain alerts are also in place across much of South-West England for the next three days, ahead of the storm’s arrival which is expected to bring two inches of rain and 50mph winds on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Storm Sebastien is expected to bring travel chaos to large parts of the country when it makes landfall, hitting already flooded areas with heavy rain.</p>
      <p>Huge waves are expected to crash into the coast of South-West England today.</p>
      <p>A Met office forecaster told Metro.co.uk: ‘Over the next three days there will be a lot of unsettled weather.</p>
      <p>‘There is a band of rain pushing north eastwards with heavy showers today.</p>
      <p>‘Storm Sebastian is expected to make landfall tomorrow, with a band of heavy rain pushing across the UK.’</p>

      <p>However, heavy rain will hit the southwest by dawn.</p>
      <p>As storm Sebastien makes landfall, tomorrow will see rain move North-East across many parts of the country.</p>
      <p>Most of the heavy rain will fall in Southern England, with as much as 60mm of rain hitting the region.</p>
      <p>Showers will also follow into the South-West, where strong winds are expected.</p>

      <p>Further low pressure on Wednesday is expected to bring outbreaks of heavy rain, especially across southern England and northern Scotland.</p>
      <p>The Met Office has issued three rain warnings over the next three days.</p>
      <p>The first for south-west England and south Wales ends at 10am today.</p>
      <p>A second alert will be in force across South-West, South and South-East England from midday tomorrow to 3pm on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Up to 60mm of rain is expected to fall in some spots, equating to roughly two weeks of rain.</p>
      <p>A final ‘danger to life’ flood warning will be put in place in Yorkshire from the midnight to 6pm on Wednesday.</p>
