        <b>A MAN has been arrested in connection with the murder of a Scots millionaire's son in an alleged California gang shooting.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Adrian Bonar, 34, a former soldier in the US army, was <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10233790/british-millionaire-soldier-murder-adrian-bonar-car-california/">found dead in the boot of a car at the side of a road</a> in the city of Anaheim on October 17.</p>

      <p>He lived about 75 miles away in Escondido, San Diego.</p>
      <p>Now, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/man-arrested-over-killing-of-scots-millionaire-s-son-z9n0px5dp">The Times</a> reports Antonio Silva, 27, is being held on suspicion of his murder after US officers raided his home and found a person who claimed to be the victim of a kidnapping, and also guns and drugs.</p>
      <p>Adrian's dad Brian, 72, from Greenock, said fighting in Iraq sent his son spiralling into drug addiction and crime.</p>
      <p>He said post-traumatic stress made him "get crazy" and make poor judgements.</p>

      <p>An Anaheim police spokesman said: “Silva was taken into custody during the service of a search warrant at his residence. Amazingly, we encountered an adult male who had been kidnapped.</p>
      <p>“We were able to rescue that person. Two rifles, two handguns and over four pounds of fentanyl [an opioid painkiller] were also found.”</p>
      <p>We told last night how the dad of slain Arlene Fraser revealed he would accept her killer hubby being freed — if he finally disclosed where his <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4991596/arlene-fraser-nat-hector-mcinnes-addiewell-nick-suzanne-law/">daughter’s body was dumped.</a></p>
      <p>Hector McInnes, 79, made the claim as he urged closure from son-in-law Nat Fraser, 60, over the 1998 murder.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2566324/murdered-arlene-fraser-dad-accepts-never-finding-out/">grieving parent,</a> of Bonnyrigg, Midlothian, said: “It would be a deal with the devil but it would be worth it.”</p>
      <p>Hector also told how he fears that time is running out for him to find out his murdered girl’s last resting place.</p>
      <p>His <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2568893/who-is-arlene-fraser-murder-nat-fraser-1998/">daughter</a> was 33 when she was last seen in April 1998 at home in Elgin, Moray, as she waved kids Jamie and Natalie, then ten and five, off to school.</p>
      <p>Fraser has since been convicted of her murder at two separate trials. It’s claimed he paid a hitman £15,000 to kill Arlene.</p>
