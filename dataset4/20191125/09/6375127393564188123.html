      <h3>A NEWS that appears to be drowned as the Philippines prepares for the opening of the 30th Southeast Asian Games (SEAG) is the proposed regularization of deserving government casual and contractual workers.</h3>
      <p>Described as “long overdue,” the measure mandates the security of tenure of casual and contractual employees who have rendered the prescribed years of service in national agencies and local government units.</p>
      <p>Pending consideration in the House of Representatives, which is dominated by pro-administration congressmen, is House Bill (HB) No. 52, which is authored by Magdalo party-list Rep. Manuel Cabochan.</p>
      <p>In filing House Bill (HB) No. 52, Congressman Cabochan noted that the government creates thousands of casual and contractual positions and hire workers to the said positions year after year.</p>
      <p>The Civil Service Commission (CSC) said that there are 96,000 contractual employees or those who perform certain tasks until their contract expires. Casuals, on the other hand, number 36,600.</p>
      <p>CSC records also show that there are currently 158,477 unfilled regular positions in the government.</p>
      <p>Under HB No. 52, all incumbent casual and contractual employees who have rendered at least 5 years of continuous service in national government agencies or a total of 10 years of continuous service in LGUs be entitled to security of tenure.</p>
      <p>“I believe these workers have already accumulated the necessary experience and skills to do their functions in the government…Nararapat lamang na sila ay maging regular,” said Cabochan.</p>
      <p>We agree with the party-list lawmaker that contractual and casual workers in the government be given the equal opportunity to serve the Filipino people as regular state employees.</p>
      <p>That’s why members of Congress – senators and congressmen – ought to speed up the passage of HB No. 52.</p>
