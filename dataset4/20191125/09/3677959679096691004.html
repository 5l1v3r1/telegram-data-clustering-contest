      <p>The PulseFire Dart offers RGB lighting using the NGenuity RGB software which will make your mouse and ChargePlay base light up! The NGenuity 2 requires Windows 10, and the mouse itself supports Windows 7/8/8.1/10.</p>
      <p>The ChargePlay Base does allow you to charge the mouse without ever having to plug in the included cable, although this charging station can only deliver up to 10 watts of power to a specific device or 15 watts if split between the two separate charging zones (meaning roughly 7.5 watts per device).</p>
      <p>The ChargePlay base is symmetrical having two halves one device per side, there are dots in a circular design to indicate where to put the devices on the pad itself, this cord is rated up to 24 watts. On each side, there is a LED that shows when that side of the Qi pad is in use. The ChargePlay base's design is amazing seamlessly blending into any desk area.</p>
