      <p>A land and sea search is under way today for a young couple who disappeared during a fishing trip near Albany.</p>
      <p>Geoffrey Bignell, 20, and Victoria McCloy, 22, are understood to have travelled to Torndirrup National Park to go rock fishing in the area and planned to camp there overnight.</p>
      <p>Ms McCloy’s mother raised the alarm this morning after they failed to return home to Northam on Sunday night. The couple last contacted family on Friday afternoon when they arrived at the Torndirrup National Park.</p>
      <p>The couple’s Holden Barina was found in carpark of Bald Head walk trail but there was no sign of the pair.</p>

      <p>Great Southern Police District Superintendent Ian Clarke said the couple were familiar with the area, having previously lived in Albany.</p>
      <p>It is understood Mr Bignell had previously fished in the area.</p>
      <p>Tonight, Department of Biodiversity Conservation and Attractions rangers, an Albany Sea Rescue plane, Albany Surf Life Saving Club jet skis and SES volunteers were part of a land and sea search for the pair.</p>
      <p>In June, six members of an Albany gym helped emergency responders complete a gruelling rescue which stretched past nightfall after a woman suffered an injury on the Bald Head walk trail.</p>
      <p>Police received a call for help on Saturday June 23, after a woman in her mid-30s broke her ankle near the end of the challenging 12.5km trail in Torndirrup National Park.</p>

      <p>An approaching storm meant using a helicopter to winch the injured hiker off the Flinders Peninsula was not an option. The woman was put on a stretcher and carried back to safety.</p>
      <p>Trails WA said a “high level of fitness and experience” was required for the Bald Head trail.</p>
      <p>“Hard core bushwalkers will enjoy this 12.5km return, six to eight hour hike,” Trails WA’s website said.</p>
      <p>“Tracks may be long, rough and very steep. Directional signage may be limited.</p>
      <p>“Terrain is steep and difficult in sections.”</p>
