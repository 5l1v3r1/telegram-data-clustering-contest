      <p>Two young sisters were rescued from a ‘dirty’ flat after reportedly being neglected by their mother who spent her cash on alcohol.</p>
      <p>Diana and Anya, aged five and one, did not eat properly and lived in an infested flat with their mother and her boyfriend in Dnipro, central Ukraine.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old mother - who has not been named - is said to have lived off the child benefits and only fed the children properly once a month.</p>
      <p>The neglected sisters were found when a concerned neighbour called the police on November 21.</p>
      <p>A female neighbour told local media: ''The woman and her boyfriend often quarrelled and fought with each other.</p>

      <p>''They constantly shouted at the children and did not take care of them. The girls were always dirty and neglected.”</p>
      <p>''There was always a horrible stench coming from their apartment.''</p>
      <p>Diana and Anya were discovered on November 21 after neighbours called the police.</p>
      <p>Police officers were reportedly shocked by the foul condition of the flat. The toilet was not working properly and the family used the bath tub instead.</p>
      <p>The tub was covered with a thick layer of dirt and infested with worms.</p>

      <p>A police told local media: ''The girls got used to sleeping in filthy bedclothes, eat from unwashed dishes and play on the littered floor.</p>
      <p>''The stench in the rooms was horrific and it was difficult to breathe.''</p>
      <p>Diana and Anya were hospitalised and diagnosed with malnutrition and lice.</p>
      <p>Paediatrician Liya Segeda said: ''The girls' stool contains styrofoam, wallpaper, hair and other objects.</p>
      <p>''They ate everything they could find in the apartment.”</p>

      <p>Ms Segeda added that, while in hospital, it was the first time the children had clean bedclothes and saw a potty.</p>
      <p>Police reported the incident to social services who are going to sue the mother and remove her parental rights.</p>
      <p>Ludmila Kopylenko, a police spokeswoman, said: ''The mother and her boyfriend are unemployed. They spent child benefits for living.</p>
      <p>''The children ate properly once per month. Their mother spent the rest of the money on alcohol.''</p>
