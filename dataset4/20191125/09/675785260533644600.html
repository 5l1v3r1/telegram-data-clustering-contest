      <h2>Dale Piggin, 42, from Leicestershire, was diagnosed with Huntington's disease in September - and he now fears he has passed the genetic condition to his family members</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:27:36+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:27</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Mack</a></address>
      <p>A teenage boy has revealed his fears that he will develop the same incurable brain condition that his father has been diagnosed with.</p>
      <p>Lorry driver Dale Piggin of Thurmaston, near Leicester, was told weeks ago that he was suffering from Huntington’s disease.</p>
      <p>The condition affects sufferer’s ability to control their own bodies and eventually kills them, reports <a href="https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/dad-diagnosed-disease-didnt-know-3562221">LeicestershireLive</a> .</p>
      <p>As a result, the 42-year-old already struggles to keep a grip on objects and is suffering dementia-like symptoms.</p>
      <p>His family fear that he has just 15 years until the degenerative condition eventually kills him.</p>
      <p>His 16-year-old son, Callum, has been told he has a 50-50 chance of having the disease but has to wait until he turns 18 in May 2021 before he finds out.</p>

      <p>Because Huntington’s cannot be treated, children at risk of the condition are better off psychologically if they do not know whether or not they have the illness.</p>
      <p>He said: “Dad is stressed and really not great but he’s trying to stay happy. He can't drive but he's looking for a new job he can do.</p>
      <p>“He has a lot of symptoms now. He twitches a lot and he drops things because he can't grip well.</p>
      <p>“It’s really bad to see him go through it all but also bad because I could get it and I can’t get tested until I turn 18.”</p>
      <p>Callum's older brother Reece has two children and another on the way and is concerned about the impact that the disease might have on his family.</p>
      <p>The teen added: “It’s like having Alzheimer's, dementia, motor neurone disease and Parkinson's all at once.</p>
      <p>“I’m heartbroken for my dad but my mum now has to watch my dad slowly die because of this cruel disease and then possibly me and my brother too.”</p>

      <p>Dale said the thought of having passed the disease is horrifying and says he had not heard about the debilitating condition until his diagnosis.</p>
      <p>He said: "It's just really depressing and stressful but what's really gutting is that I might have passed it to my sons or my grandchildren.</p>
      <p>"I didn't know anything about the disease until a few weeks ago and it's been a huge shock.</p>
      <p>"Now it's getting hard to control my body and people notice so I tend not to want to go out of the house any more."</p>
      <p>The first signs arrived four years ago.</p>
      <p>Dale had been carrying some drinks when his elbow started shooting up in the air.</p>
      <p>His wife, Vicky, said: "We were on holiday and he was walking back from the bar and his elbow was shooting up.</p>
      <p>"Music was playing and it was like he was dancing so we were laughing."</p>
      <p>It took years for the true cause of the symptoms to be revealed.</p>
      <p>In September, a new neurologist saw Dale and his first thought was Huntington's.</p>
      <p>Usually people being diagnosed with the disease nowadays are partly prepared for it because a relative already has it.</p>
      <p>But Dale does not know of anyone in his family who has been diagnosed with it.</p>
      <p>Vicky said: “Now it's been diagnosed it's sad and horrible and we can only be grateful he may have about 15 years before it kills him - compared to other illnesses other people get diagnosed with, it's a lot of time still to spend with his family, even though he won't remember most of it."</p>
      <p>Callum has shared his family's story to raise money so they can make changes to their home.</p>
      <p>Making major improvements to the house - including installing a bathroom and a stairlift will have a huge affect on how long Dale can live at home.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-my-dad-stay-at-home-longer">GoFundMe page</a>  has already raised more than £1,300 in just five days.</p>
      <p>Callum said: “We only shared the page around family and friends to start with and it was a big surprise when we raised so much.</p>
      <p>“I’m not sure how it’s been so good – people are being really generous and giving more than we expected.”</p>
