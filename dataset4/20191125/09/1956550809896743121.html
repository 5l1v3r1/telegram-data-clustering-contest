      <p>The <a href="https://www.timeoutabudhabi.com/bars-nightlife/423390-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-abu-dhabi-grand-prix-2019">Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</a> may be all about sport, nightlife and fun but would it be as exciting if there wasn’t food involved?<br/><br/>With that in mind, we’ve teamed up with some of Abu Dhabi’s very best restaurants and the Department of Tourism and Culture – Abu Dhabi, to bring you <a href="https://www.timeoutabudhabi.com/pitstopmenus">Pit Stop Menus</a>.<br/><br/>The idea is simple – each restaurant will offer a special set menu until December 2 to showcase its very best dishes. All you need to do is decide which one (or two, or three, or ten…) you want to go to and tuck in. With the likes of Hakkasan, Roberto’s, Tamba and Catch involved, you’re really going to be spoiled for choice.<br/><br/>Add in more incredible venues such as Alba Terrace, Cho Gao, KOI and Namak by Kunal Kapur and you have the recipe for a very busy (and filling) Race Week indeed.<br/><br/>Here are seven of our top picks to try during Race Week.<br/><br/><b>Amerigos Mexican Bar &amp; Restaurant</b><br/>This Yas Island restaurant is a friendly and chilled-out spot for a bite to eat. It’s had a revamp recently and now the dining room is bright and colourful with cool Mexican-themed art covering the walls, while the terrace is surrounded by palm trees and fairy lights and offers views over Yas Links. The limited-edition menu features super satisfying plates like chicken or vegetable fajitas, tuna salad and sweetcorn cakes.<br/><i>Dhs230. Daily noon-1.30am. Park Inn by Radisson Abu Dhabi, Yas Island (02 656 2000).</i><br/><br/><b>Catch</b><br/>With an incredible location on the Corniche overlooking the crystal clear waters of the Arabian Gulf, Catch definitely has some of the best views in town and it’s a great place to grab a bite to eat, too. Make your way there on Race Week and you can enjoy a three-course menu for Dhs199 and take your pick from a host of dishes including sea bass ceviche, gyoza, miso-marinated salmon, wok-fried noodles, chocolate fondant and more.<br/><i>Dhs199. Daily noon-1am. Nation Riviera Beach Club, Corniche West (02 611 0909).</i><br/><br/><b>Dahab Restaurant &amp; Lounge</b><br/>With regular live music nights, a wide open terrace and an extensive menu of Lebanese specialties, Dahab is one of the best places to go in Abu Dhabi for Middle Eastern food and a good time. Over the next few weeks you can try four courses of authentic dishes including hot and cold mezze, mixed grills and traditional desserts.<br/><i>Dhs200. Daily 7pm-3am. Hilton Capital Grand Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum Street Road (02 667 4446).</i><br/><br/><b>Mazi</b><br/>This New Greek restaurant has already made an impression on the capital. During Race Week it’s offering a smashing set menu of favourites for Dhs200 per person, making it a great way to try this excellent addition to the Abu Dhabi dining scene for the first time.<br/><i>Dhs200. Open Sun-Thu 4pm-midnight; Fri-Sat noon-midnight. The St. Regis Saadiyat Island Resort, Abu Dhabi (02 304 8145).</i><br/><br/><b>Pachaylen</b><br/>At Pachaylen you can always expect to be served fresh, authentic and vibrant Thai food. The dining room is super pretty and glamorous, and with a spot on the Eastern Mangroves you can always go for a stroll after your meal and admire this amazing area of natural beauty. The Pit Stop promotion on offer includes a grea regular or vegetarian set menu, which includes dishes such as spicy seafood soup, steam seabass and beef massaman curry for meat eaters, and there is Thai green tofu curry, wok-fried aubergine and vegetable dumplings for the veggies out there.<br/><i>Dhs199. Daily 7pm-11pm. Eastern Mangroves Hotel and Spa by Anantara, Salam Street (02 656 1000).</i><br/><br/><b>The Grill</b><br/>Found at the Marriott Hotel Al Forsan in Khalifa City, this sophisticated restaurant offers fine dining at its best. The cuts of meat are amazing, but it also produces salads, fresh seafood and impressive desserts exceptionally well too. The Pit Stop menu features three courses including starters of The Grill Salad and grilled octopus, mains of wagyu steaks and salmon, plus chocolate soufflé and spiced pineapple for dessert.<br/><i>Dhs299. Daily 6.30pm-11.30pm. Marriott Hotel Al Forsan, Khalifa City A (02 201 4131).</i><br/><br/><b>VaKaVa</b><br/>The latest South American restaurant to open in  Abu Dhabi has a very colourful and Insta-worthy dining room. The Latin-inspired plates are presented with style and a bit of a drama (we’re talking about the smoking guacamole in particular), and every dish is expertly made. The set menu includes hot and cold starters like beef empanada and the previously mentioned smoking guac, plus mains like Chilean sea bass and veal ribs, with creamy tres leches cake for dessert.<br/><i>Dhs320. Mon-Sat 7pm-11pm. Jumeirah at Etihad Towers, Corniche West (02 811 5666).</i></p>
