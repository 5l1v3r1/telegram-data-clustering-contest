      <h2>Manchester United's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward appeared to engage in a heated debate with legendary Red Devils boss Sir Alex Ferguson at Bramall Lane on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:45:24+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:45</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, Judi James, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/judi-james/</a></address>
      <p>An animated conversation between Sir Alex Ferguson and Ed Woodward caught the eye during Manchester United's 3-3 draw with Sheffield United on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The legendary Red Devils boss was joined by the club's executive vice-chairman in the stands at Bramall Road, as the pair watched United drop two points against the Blades.</p>
      <p>The duo were pictured chatting throughout the match, but two images in particular caught the eye as they appeared to show Ferguson and Woodward locked in a heated debeate.</p>
      <p>It is not known what the pair were discussing, but we have asked body language expert Judi James to analyse the images and shed some light on what was going on.</p>

        <i>Ed Woodward's very animated body language here suggests he's making some extremely lively and emphatic points to Sir Alex Ferguson while looking less than in awe of the Man United legend, who has a reputation for making some fiery points of his own in the past.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The rounding of his cheeks and the slight pursing of his lips suggest overall good humour in Ed's approach but he is using enough signals of fight or battle here to suggest he's firmly standing his ground in the face of what could be any criticism from Ferguson.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The impression of a battle between the two men comes primarily from the way the pointed fingers are being employed.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>This gesture is like an invitation to a 'duel', with the index fingers acting as weapon-substitutes.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>In this case Woodward appears to avoid aiming any direct pointing with the back of the hand on top at Ferguson, which would form the kind of mimed 'poking/prodding' gesture that can often prompt an angry response.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The one shot where he is pointing directly he keeps his hand palm-upward, suggesting he's keen to win verbal points rather than engage in an angry fight.</i>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Picture one:</b> Woodward's facial expression suggest total emphasis on his message, as though he could be responding to a criticism and keen to defend himself actively.</p>
      <p>His brows are fully raised, his eyes are wide open and staring in emphasis and his mouth is wide open too.</p>
      <p>There's a hint of humour in the slightly rounded cheeks here though, rather than suggestions of genuine, open anger.</p>
      <p>Both men have activated their index fingers here, which is a bit like unsheathing their weapons. Ed's is pointed to one side though and Fergie's is dropped down, so this isn't toe-to-toe at this moment.</p>
      <p><b>Picture two:</b> Woodward is frowning here and using a lip clamp as he directs Ferguson to look upward with another finger point. Is he pointing at the scoreboard? Either way Ferguson looks up to study it too.</p>

      <p><b>Picture three:</b> This more directional point could look like an accusatory attack except Woodward has turned the back of his hand down to point up at Ferguson, which makes the gesture look attacking but also slightly wary and respectful.</p>
      <p>His eye-stare could also look aggressive here but his rounded cheeks suggest there is some humour in his approach to diffuse it.</p>
