      <p>Tawasa Harris, Camron's longtime girlfriend and mother of his son, has passed away. The news was delivered via Harris' close friend on Facebook in a post, with Harris' cousin claiming that she died after suffering a heart attack. No further details are known about Harris' death.</p>
      <p>Last year, Cam'ron paid tribute to Harris, who he started dating in high school, on Instagram, writing, "I just want to tell her thank you for having my back and being the disciplinary in our sons life. I didn’t have a father in my life so I could never tell my son no to anything. But because of her our son had 5 full academic scholarship offers." Cam'ron also shared throwback photos of him and Harris along with new photos of their son, which you can view up top. </p>
