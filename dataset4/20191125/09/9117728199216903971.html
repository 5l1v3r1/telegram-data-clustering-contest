        <b>Eddie Jordan says that there is nobody in F1 capable of challenging Lewis Hamilton as the Brit looks to secure a fourth title in a row and seventh overall next season. Jordan also believes Hamilton will still be number one when the new regulations in 2021 come out, saying he can <i>"dominate the way he wants"</i>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamilton has been unbeatable again this season, taking ten victories on his charge to yet another world title.</p>

      <p>Despite the emergence of Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc, and the constant threat of Valtteri Bottas and Sebastian Vettel, Jordan believes that Hamilton is in a league of his own when it comes to winning.</p>
      <p>He told Gulf News: <i>“Honestly, he doesn’t need to get much better. He just needs to continue because there is nobody really out there to challenge him.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Perhaps he took his eye off the ball against Nico Rosberg. Nico is a clever one as he decided to retire as he would have never won another championship if Lewis continued the way he has just done.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Having said that Lewis is in his own realm. He can dominate the way he wants."</i>
