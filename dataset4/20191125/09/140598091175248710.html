      <h1>Taylor Swift breaks Michael Jackson's record at the American Music Awards</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:40:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/press-association/" target="_blank">Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Last night at the American Music Awards, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/taylor-swift-vs-scooter-braun-releasing-swifties-right-way-get/">Taylor Swift </a>was named artist of the decade, an honour announced before the ceremony, and scooped the biggest prize of the night, artist of the year.</p>
      <p>Accepting the latter, an emotional Swift said the previous 12 months had given her "some of the most amazing times", as well as "the hardest things I've gone through in my life".</p>
      <p>She has been embroiled in a high-profile feud with prominent talent manager Scooter Braun and her former record label over her back catalogue. "This industry is really weird," Swift said.</p>
      <p>She thanked her fans, adding: "This year for me has been a lot. It's been a lot of good, it's been a lot of really complicated."</p>
      <p>Swift won artist of the year ahead of Drake, Ariana Grande, Halsey and Post Malone. It capped a night of celebration for Swift, who had already been named artist of the decade.</p>

      <p>Before she accepted that prize, a video retrospective of 29-year-old Swift's already glittering career played. She then treated fans inside Los Angeles's Microsoft Theater to a medley of some of her biggest hits.</p>
      <p>Swift decided against overt references to her dispute with Braun, but did open her performance with a brief portion of her song The Man, which debates how much more successful she would be if she were a male.</p>
      <p>Fans also noted Swift wore a white button-down jacket featuring the titles of her old albums including Speak Now, Red and Fearless. During her acceptance speech, Swift reduced many in the audience to tears - including her mother Andrea - and said the honour celebrated 10 years of "hard work and of art and of fun and memories".</p>
      <p>She added: "All that matters to me is the memories I have had with you guys, with you the fans, over the years. We've had fun, incredible, exhilarating, extraordinary times together and may it continue."</p>
      <p>"I am so lucky to get to do this," Swift added.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Swift won favourite pop/rock album for her latest album Lover. Her six wins make her the most successful AMAs artist ever, with a total of 29, dethroning Michael Jackson, who won 22.</p>
