      <p>In case you were wondering, no Jenna Dewan did not throw shade at Camila Cabello as she performed at Sunday’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/american-music-awards/">American Music Awards</a>.</p>
      <p>After eagle-eyed punters thought they’d caught the pregnant dancer commenting on Camila’s Senorita routine, Jenna was quick to dismiss the claims.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the night, in a clip shared online, social media followers believed Jenna leant into BFF Brad Goreski and whispered ‘she’s so extra’ the way of Camila, who was performing alongside <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/shawn-mendes/">Shawn Mendes</a>.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>While being labelled as ‘extra’ isn’t always seen as a bad thing, Jenna’s apparent eye roll caused fans to wonder whether it was at all a complimentary comment.</p>
      <p>They were all, oh no she didn’t!</p>
      <p>Turns out, well, no she actually didn’t.</p>
      <p>Setting the record straight as she left the venue, held at the Microsoft Theatre on Los Angeles, Jenna said: ‘I’m getting a lot of texts messages from people wondering if I was shading Camila. No! I love her, I love her so much.</p>
      <p>‘I’m such a big fan of hers.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t understand what that’s about but no, I love her, love her, love her.’</p>

      <p>So, you love her?</p>
      <p>Brad wanted to make it abundantly clear to any haters that he, too, loved Camila.</p>
      <p>‘Guys, we were bumping and grinding so hard to Senorita,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘We’re obsessed.’</p>
      <p>Jenna then added: ‘That’s my favourite song!’</p>

      <p>Alright, alright, we get it – you’re a fan. And, at the same time people thought Jenna was shading the singer, others speculated she was actually saying to Brad ‘she sounds good’.</p>
      <p>Can we get a lip reader up in here?</p>

      <p>Camila had taken to the stage for the saucy song alongside boyfriend Shawn, the two lighting up the theatre and having everyone clutching their pearls – including Jenna, we suppose.</p>

      <p>The Step Up star – who is expecting her second child, and first with boyfriend Steve Kazee –<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/pregnant-jenna-dewan-vision-shows-off-growing-baby-bump-amas-red-carpet-11212825/"> had earlier walked the red carpet in an amazing pink gown</a>, cradling her growing baby bump.</p>
      <p>Jenna and Steve announced they were expecting back in September, as they said in a statement: ‘We are beyond overjoyed and couldn’t be happier to be expanding our family!’</p>
      <p>Jenna also has a six-year-old daughter, Everly, with ex-husband Channing Tatum.</p>
