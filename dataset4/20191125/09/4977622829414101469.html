      <p>In a major step towards promotion of sports and fitness in the school curriculum across the nation, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi yesterday (24 November) launched the Fit India school grading system on a pan-India basis, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/sport-others/pm-narendra-modi-launches-fit-india-school-grading-system-6134846/">reports </a><i>Indian Express.</i></p>
      <p>The grading system would rate the schools across the length and breadth of the nation into three categories - the first level, the schools with three stars, and the schools with five stars. This is aimed at inducing competitive spirit among school administrations to promote sports and fitness among students.</p>
      <p>The schools would be awarded with a ranking on the weight of the importance accorded by it towards ensuring fitness among students and teaches, apart from making available all required facilities in this respect.</p>
