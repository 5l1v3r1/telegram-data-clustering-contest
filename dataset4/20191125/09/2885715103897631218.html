      <h1>Big Little Lies season 3 fate rests on writers: Nicole Kidman</h1>

      <p>Actor Nicole Kidman says a third season of Big Little Lies is only possible if the show’s writers are up for it.</p>
      <p>Based on the novel of the same name by Liane Moriarty and created by David E Kelley, the HBO series follows five women in Monterey, California who become embroiled in a murder investigation.</p>
      <p>Kidman, who both starred and executive produced the show with actor Reese Witherspoon, said the decision to go for another or more installments depends on the scribes.</p>
      <p>“David E Kelley constructed this show with Liane Moriarty. They built it from the ground up, and it’s their show, and we’ll see if they’re ignited into building a life for these women, and which way they would go next. We’ll find out. If there is a third one, all of it will come from the writers, and that’s amazing,” she told Deadline.</p>
      <p>Kidman also praised Moriarty and Kelley for their genius.</p>
      <p>“Liane is deeply talented. David is deeply talented, and the combination of them is extraordinary. So, where they would take it, I have no idea.</p>
      <p>“You have to bow down to the writers, because that really is where it starts. Unless you’re a director/writer, and then you write it. But this show, we’ll see what Liane can muster, and if she has an interest in it,” she added.</p>
      <p>Kidman’s comments follow reported creative behind-the-scenes tensions between the show’s season two director Andrea Arnold and the network responding to the allegations by stating that there “wouldn’t be a season 2” without Andrea and that they are “proud of her work”.</p>
      <p>The actor earlier said she would love Big Little Lies to get a third season.</p>
      <p>The sophomore season of the show, which aired in June, also featured Shailene Woodley, Meryl Streep, Laura Dern and Zoe Kravitz.</p>
