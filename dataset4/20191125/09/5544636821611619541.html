      <p>The <a href="http://concisenews.global/entertainment/">Nollywood movie industry</a> has lost a veteran, Theodore Anyanji, who died in Lagos, on Saturday, November 23, <a href="http://concisenews.global/">Concise News</a> understands.</p>
      <p>Anyanji reportedly passed on at a prayer healing church in Festac, Lagos State, after battling a heart and kidney-related ailment for months.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a fundraiser had been announced on the actor’s behalf, earlier this month, but yielded little or no result.</p>
      <p>The news of Anyanji’s death was announced on Sunday by actor, Valentine Opute in a social media post.</p>
      <p>“Go well Theodore. You fought a good fight. Theodore the Star maker. A perfectionist in all spheres. Last I spoke with you, you sounded” Opute wrote.</p>
      <p>“Strong and promising, not knowing it was a farewell call I gave you. This pricks my heart so deeply I must say. Theodore gave me my first ever major role in a movie in 2008 INDIAN DOCTOR, Just like he did to a lot other now successful actors. The GOLD behind a thousand and one Nollywood evergreen movies. It is well.”</p>
      <p>Anyanji was a member of the Directors Guild of Nigeria and made countless Nollywood hits.</p>
      <p>He also directed and scripted projects such as The Plain Truth 2 (2008), Greatest Weapon (2006) and Ihite Kingdom 2 (2014)</p>
