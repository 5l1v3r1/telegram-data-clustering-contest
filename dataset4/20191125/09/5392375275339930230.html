      <p>Realme will expand its activities in India with over 100 more service centres<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>Realme is a phenomenon and there’s no way to deny this fact. The company which started in May 2018 with <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Realme-1">Realme 1</a> is now the fastest-growing smartphone brand and crowns itself as one of the top 10 smartphone manufacturers in the world. The smartphone brand that started as Oppo’s subsidiary, can now be considered a sister company, having its own powerful slice of the market and a large number of users. The company started its activities in India and during its short life period already has 14.3% of the Indian market.</p>

      <p>Realme is a hit with various smartphones in different price ranges. All of them come with compelling specifications and good value for money. The company started its Global campaign this year and already has a flagship smartphone in the form of Realme X2 Pro.  Despite their growing ambition in the International markets, Realme is still very committed to the Indian market. The company’s Indian CEO, Madhav Seth, has just announced that they will be greatly expanding their physical presence. Realme will open new stores and venue very soon. Moreover, the company will open over 100 more service centers across the country. They currently have 345, but until the next year, this number will grow to 435. Thus allowing users to have a fast way to fix and have local support for their smartphones.</p>
      <p>Realme started as an online-only brand, but now it is giving a significant step to also be a physical brand. There is a large part of people who prefer to walk to a store, try a smartphone and then buy it. Considering how fast the company is growing, we expect to see it becoming Xiaomi’s major rival in the Indian stronghold.</p>
