      <p>Back in August, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/8/virgil-abloh-off-white-nike-dunk-low-confirms-green-colorway-three-models">Virgil Abloh confirmed</a> three <a href="https://hypebeast.com/brands/off-white">Off-White™</a> x <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nike-dunk-low">Nike Dunk Low</a>s were on their way. Taking to social media earlier today, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/virgil-abloh-off-white-nike-dunk-low-release-teaser">Virg gave fans another teaser</a> of the highly-anticipated model, which is now expected to release on December 20.</p>
      <p>Thanks to <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/stadium-goods">Stadium Goods</a>, we now have our best look yet at the forthcoming “Pine Green” colorway dressing the aforementioned sneaker. The collaborative silhouette sports a green and white upper, finished off with a matching white midsole and green outsole. Off-White™’s signature additions include the zip ties dressed in full white hanging off of the orange hiking-inspired lacing system, and orange accents featured on the lateral Swoosh insignias and tongue tab branding. Finally Off-White™’s boldface iconography is embellished on the medial sides.</p>
