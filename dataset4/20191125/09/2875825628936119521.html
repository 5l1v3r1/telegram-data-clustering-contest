      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm a Celebrity</a> star Andy Whyment, 38, seems laid back and confident during his appearance on the show.</p>
      <p>But the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> actor hasn't had an easy ride to fame, and was once so badly bullied his dad considered moving him to another school.</p>
      <p>Andy, who plays Kirk Sutherland on the ITV soap, was passionate about acting and dancing from a young age.</p>
      <p>He began ballet aged eight, but other kids at his Bolton school were jealous and would relentlessly tease him.</p>
      <p>“It was ­verbal rather than physical, but once one started a few of them would join in", Andy said.</p>

      <p>"It was jealousy more than anything else. I was ­doing something with my life and they were just hanging about the street corners getting hammered every week.</p>
      <p>“At one stage my dad was thinking of pulling me out of the school.</p>
      <p>“But I told him I didn’t want him to, because if I left then they’d have won. So I stayed and got on with it.”</p>
      <p>Andy has been on TV since he was a teenager, starting with roles on shows including Where The Heart Is and The Royle Family.</p>

      <p>He also sang in a rock band and busked in Manchester for three years so he didn't have to "sponge off" his parents.</p>
      <p>Andy said his bullies were "hanging around on street corners and I was doing something with my life".</p>
      <p>He added that his acting success means he would always encourage kids now to follow their dreams.</p>
      <p>"At the end of the day, I’ve done quite well out of it", he said.</p>
      <p>“Always stick to your dreams. I was bullied because I was different and wanted to be an actor.</p>

      <p>“If you are being bullied don’t let it get you down because bullies quickly become bored and move on, and speak to an adult you trust.”</p>
      <p>Andy only entered the jungle camp on Thursday, but he's already become the new favourite to win the show.</p>
      <p>He won the hearts of the viewers with his rolling commentary during a Bushtucker Trial which saw Cliff Parisi try to avoid Buffallos and lucky dips his way through to find his five stars.</p>
      <p>Andy’s commentary and comparing it to “just like watching it on the telly” had hosts Ant and Dec in stitches throughout before being sent to Jungle Jail by the sheriff.</p>
