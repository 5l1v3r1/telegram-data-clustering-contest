      <h1>Small Business Resource Center: cards, calendars and more</h1>

      <p>The holidays are here! So much to do, so little time. Let the Small Business Resource Center help you out with templates to spread the cheer and get and stay organised into the new year.</p>
      <p>With the holidays comes the release of the 2020 Xerox Calendar. I don’t know about you, but I find it hard to believe that in about a week, it will be Thanksgiving in the US. Then it is just a short time until Chanukah, Christmas, Kwanzaa and the new year. Just in time for all your holiday needs, I wanted to remind you about the free templates that you can print out.</p>
      <p>The free templates include the 2020 calendars in different formats, customisable calendars, holiday greeting cards for Christmas, Season’s Greetings, Chanukah, and even a Kwanzaa card. These cards come in many styles and designs that are customisable, so you can send the message you want to share with your customers, employees, co-workers, friends and family.</p>
