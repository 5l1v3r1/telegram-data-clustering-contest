      <p><b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Master_Fencer">Master Fencer</a></b>, who made history earlier this year when becoming the first Japanese-bred colt to run in the Kentucky Derby, will return to the races in his home country.</p>
      <p>A months-long quarantine and some rest followed a three-race U.S. campaign, leading the 3-year-old son of Just a Way to be entered in an allowance level event Saturday at Chukyo Racecourse.</p>
      <p>The Koichi Tsunoda trainee, who runs for owner/breeder Katsumi Yoshizawa, will carry the co-high weight of 56 kilograms in a field that includes older horses of both genders under handicap conditions. The race, 11 of 12 on the card, measures about 1 3/16 miles.</p>
      <p>After connections to other Japanese horses declined an invitation to the Kentucky Derby, Master Fencer made a determined rally up the rail on his way to being placed fifth on the first Saturday in May at 58-1 odds.</p>
      <p>Back five weeks later in the Belmont Stakes, the colt did his best running late again to be fifth.</p>
      <p>"I had a really good time here and enjoyed the experience," Yoshizawa said after the race. "I learned a lot for next time."</p>
      <p>Master Fencer surprisingly stuck around in the U.S. to finish next to last most recently in the July 6 Belmont Derby Invitational (G1) on turf.</p>
      <p>Saturday's race will have him back on dirt against as many as 19 rivals before he attempts a stakes race again.</p>
