      <h1>Gold palm trees adorn the monochromatic interior of Darial concept store in Barcelona</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:00:50+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/ali-morris/" target="_blank">Ali Morris</a></address>
      <p>Towering gold pillars shaped like palm trees, ivory carpets and black lacquer screens fill this dramatic concept <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/shops/">store</a> in <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/barcelona/">Barcelona</a>, which has been designed by haute couturier Djaba Diassamidze.</p>
      <p>Called <a href="http://www.darial.com/">Darial</a>, the 1,500-square-metre lifestyle store takes over the ground floor and basement of Casa Tomàs Roger, a 19th-century building in the city's Dreta de l'Eixample neighbourhood.</p>

      <p>Conceived and founded by the Paris-based haute couturier Djaba Diassamidze, the minimalist store is described as an "experiential" retail space.</p>
      <p>It sells an evolving selection of clothing, books, art, furniture and design objects by hundreds of different brands, and also boasts a brasserie-style restaurant and event space.</p>

      <p>The store, along with the restaurant and the bookshop, is spread across the ground floor.</p>
      <p>It's divided into a series of lofty white spaces dotted with palm tree-shaped gold pillars, their fronds unfurling across the ceilings. Partitions have otherwise been largely omitted, allowing the spaces to flow seamlessly into one another.</p>

      <p>Ivory-coloured carpets and marble tiles are used on the floors to create a sharp contrast with opulent black furnishings that decoratte the space, including pieces by Muller van Severen, Impossible Project, Lomography and Bang &amp; Olufsen.</p>
      <p>Merchandise is displayed like art on sleek black-lacquer shelving that was custom designed for the store.</p>

      <p>Certain features in the store, like the grandiose arched doorways, are Diassamidze's attempt to reference art-deco-style decor. The folding screens are also meant to nod to the store's name, Darial, which means gate in old Persian.</p>

      <p>Classic 1963 film The Leopard inspired the aesthetic of the 70-seat restaurant, which features gold-leaf ceilings and seating banquettes upholstered in red velvet.</p>

      <p>A carpet-lined staircase leads down to the gallery on the lower-ground floor, which looks out onto a courtyard.</p>
      <p>At this level, there is also a "cloister-like" space with concrete floors and vaulted openings which is used to host temporary exhibitions and collaborations with contemporary artists.</p>

      <p>Barcelona is home to a host of design-focused retail spaces – January of this year saw the opening of a Camper branch along the city's famous Passeig de Gracià. The footwear store is <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/01/30/barcelona-camper-store-kengo-kuma-interiors/">covered in concave terracotta tiles</a>, which serve as display shelves for the various shoe styles on offer.</p>
