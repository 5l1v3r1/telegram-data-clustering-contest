      <p>Six female students aged 14 to 17 years who have since recorded fresh statements said the 46-year-old director had access to the girls’ dormitory and randomly picked girls to take to his house, which is near the school.  They said he would sometime sneak them out of school for sexual orgies in Kampala.</p>
      <p>President Museveni ordered the probe after Wamala was released on bail after being charged with indecent assault and not defilement.</p>

      <p>The Police anti-narcotics department has deployed on expansive marijuana farms in Nakasongola, Nwoya and Kasese districts.</p>
      <p>This follows revelations that four companies were growing marijuana on a commercial scale without licences. Sources said the firms were growing it on over 7,000ha and still need more.</p>
      <p>Over 90 companies, including foreign ones, have applied to the Government for licences to allow them grow marijuana on a commercial scale for medicinal purposes.</p>
      <p>The Police anti-narcotics department boss, Tinka Zarugaba, said: “The firms were allowed to cultivate as their licences are being regularised.”</p>
      <p>Explaining the growth of marijuana, Zarugaba said: “The department (antinarcotics) is there to regulate and they have done so to ensure that the product is not diverted to the illegal market. We have deployed staff at the gardens and in transportation and where they process.”</p>

      <p>A two-day heavy downpour has left one person dead and two missing in Mbale district. The rain, which started on Friday and continued through Saturday, brought traffic flow in Mbale municipality to a standstill as River Namatala on the Mbale-Kumi road and River Nabuyo on Mbale-Tororo road broke their banks, leading to flooding.</p>
      <p>The two roads were the most affected since some sections such as the Nabuyo suburb, Busamaga, Kampala Road, Namatala, Namakwekwe and Nabuyonga bypass got flooded, hence affecting traffic flow.</p>
      <p>The institutions that include Livingston University, Grace Secondary School, Parents Secondary School, Busamaga Bridge and Kumi road bridges were all flooded. People could not cross from one side to the other.</p>
      <p>According to eyewitnesses an unidentified bodaboda rider who was transporting a female passenger was swept away by floodwater as he tried to cross the Nabuyonga Bridge and by press time only the motorcycle had been recovered.</p>

      <p>The death toll from floods and landslides in Kenya's west over the weekend has climbed to 52, an official said Monday, with more heavy rain forecast to lash the region.</p>
      <p>Bodies were still being recovered in the Pokot region, 350 kilometres (220 miles) northwest of the capital Nairobi, after powerful walls of mud and rock swept away homes and buried people in their sleep early Saturday.</p>
      <p>West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo said a mother and her three children were among those found by rescuers sifting through the devastation. </p>

      <p>Kenya's interior ministry said Saturday that army and police helicopters have been sent to West Pokot, where the initial death toll was around 30.</p>
      <p>Rescue efforts were delayed because roads and bridges had been cut after streams turned into raging torrents, and Lonyangapuo said transport remained a problem.</p>
      <p>The Kenya Meteorological Department has warned that more heavy rainfall is expected to lash parts of country until Tuesday, including in West Pokot, and urged people to be on high alert for landslides.</p>

      <p>You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of hope and achievement. You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand.</p>
