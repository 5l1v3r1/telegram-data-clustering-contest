      <p>Former Aston Villa striker Darren Bent reckons Aleksandar Mitrovic could be a good singing for his old club.</p>
      <p>The Serbia international has enjoyed a brilliant start to the 2019/20 season, scoring 12 goals in 16 games for Fulham.</p>

      <p>The 25-year-old’s excellent haul means he currently leads the way in the Championship goalscoring charts – he’s currently one ahead of Jarrod Bowen and Ollie Watkins (both 11).</p>
      <p>In the eyes of Bent, Mitrovic is ‘too good’ to be playing in England’s second tier.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/talkSPORT/status/1198612233548369920">He said on talkSPORT</a>: “I think come January, Mitrovic might be gone.</p>
      <p>“100 percent, I can see a few Premier League teams [that could come in for him], like Aston Villa whose centre forwards aren’t scoring that many goals.</p>

      <p>“He’s too good for the Championship Mitrovic. Big, strong, powerful target man, scores goals when given the service.”</p>
      <p>Mitrovic was the subject of transfer speculation in the summer following the Cottagers’ relegation, but he ultimately stayed put with the side that paid Newcastle United £22 million for him in the summer of 2018 (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44992808">BBC Sport</a>).</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Competition for Wesley?</h3>
      <p>Mitrovic would be a great signing for Villa, but would not come cheap given his importance to promotion-chasing Fulham.</p>

      <p>His arrival would really shake things up at Villa, with Wesley probably in need of some competition right now.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian proved last year he can cut it in the top-flight, and his presence at Villa would light a fire under the South American.</p>
