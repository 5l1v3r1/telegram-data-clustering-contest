      <h1>"No plans" for Project xCloud exclusives</h1>
      <h2>Microsoft emphasises that it is "very early in the multi-year journey" for games streaming service</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:38:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/?author=1570" target="_blank">James Batchelor</a></address>
      <p>Xbox has said there are currently no plans to develop titles specifically for Project xCloud.</p>
      <p>A company spokesperson told <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/354659/Microsoft_considering_xCloudexclusive_games_from_first_and_third_party_studios.php">Gamasutra</a> that plans for the service are focused on streaming games from its consoles, rather than building ones that are entirely dependent on the cloud.</p>
      <p>"We're very early in the multi-year journey for Project xCloud, which is currently in public preview," the spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>"We are investigating a variety of new capabilities made possible by the cloud. However, we remain committed to an approach with game streaming that is complementary to console and have no plans for cloud-exclusive content at this time."</p>
      <p>The suggestion of Project xCloud exclusives originated from an <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/xcloud-exclusive-games/">Stevivor</a> interview with the service's corporate vice president Kareem Choudhry, who said Xbox was in "early talks with first- and third- parties" about cloud-only titles, although he stressed there was nothing to announce at this time.</p>

      <p>As mentioned, Project xCloud is currently in public preview. At X019 in London earlier this month, the platform holder it was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-14-project-xcloud-expands-with-50-new-titles-coming-to-more-markets-next-year">expanding the preview from four titles to more than 50</a> with plans to bring the service to new markets in 2020, including India, Japan and Canada.</p>
      <p>Microsoft's main rival in the streaming space, Google Stadia, launched last week with one exclusives. When the internet giant announced the service earlier this year, it also announced a new studio that would be developing games that are only possible when powered by the cloud.</p>
      <p>However, only one exclusive title has launched so far: Gylt, a spooky adventure by Tequilla Works.</p>
      <p>We <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-10-24-google-is-making-a-spectrum-of-bets-on-stadia-content">spoke to Stadia Games &amp; Entertainment boss Jade Raymond last month</a> about the "spectrum of bets" Google is making on Stadia.</p>
      <p>Critics were largely disappointed with Stadia in its launch form, as you can <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-21-google-stadia-critical-consensus">read in our latest Critical Consensus</a>.</p>
