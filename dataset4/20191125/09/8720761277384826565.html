      <h1>Uber Loses License To Operate in London, One of Its Biggest Markets</h1>

      <p>Uber has <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/25/uber-loses-license-to-operate-in-london-one-of-its-biggest-markets/">lost its license to operate in London</a>, one of its biggest markets globally, with a local transport regulator reaffirming a previous claim that Uber is not a "fit and proper" operator. From a report:<i> The regulator also found that Uber's systems are "easily manipulated" by unauthorized drivers. The announcement follows a two-year battle with Transport for London (TfL) that kicked off back in September 2017, when the local transport regulator ruled that Uber failed to take sufficient "corporate responsibility" when it came to safety and security. Concerns included its approach to reporting crimes and its process for driver background checks. Although TfL conceded that Uber has since made some "positive changes," the regulator identified a continued "pattern of failures," including "breaches that placed passengers and their safety at risk." "As the regulator of private hire services in London, we are required to make a decision today on whether Uber is fit and proper to hold a licence," said Helen Chapman, TfL's director of licensing, regulation, and charging. "Safety is our absolute top priority. While we recognize Uber has made improvements, it is unacceptable that Uber has allowed passengers to get into minicabs with drivers who are potentially unlicensed and uninsured."</i></p>
