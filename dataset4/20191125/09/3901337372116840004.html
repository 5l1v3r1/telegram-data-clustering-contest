      <p>The winner of the 2019 Ballon d'Or award will be named on 2 December, and Real Madrid star Eden Hazard, who is one of the nominees, has made his pick for the award. </p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with <i>Le Parisien</i>, the former Chelsea star backed one of the Liverpool trio of Mane, Mohamed Salah or Virgil van Dijk to walk away with award, but singled the Senegal star out in particular. </p>

      <p>"I would give it to a Liverpool player. Mane, Salah or Van Dijk deserve it," Hazard said.</p>
      <p>"If Sadio had won AFCON with Senegal, there would have been no debate. It would be beautiful if he won it.</p>
      <p>"Or Momo (Salah), who is one of my friends. It would be a good thing for both African and English football."</p>
