      <p>Furious I'm A Celebrity fans have launched a petition to get Ian Wright a roast dinner after branding last night's live trial "unfair".</p>
      <p>Most of the camp had to take part in last night's bushtucker trial, in which they had to win stars to win roast dinners for each of the celebrities.</p>
      <p>After winning all but the last three meals for camp, it was up to James and Roman to try the last trial.</p>
      <p>However, despite James trying his best, the final one was incredibly difficult and the pair failed to get any stars - meaning that Ian, Andy and Cliff wouldn't be having a roast dinner.</p>

      <p>And viewers accused the trial of being impossible and were particularly worried for "hangry" Ian.</p>
      <p>Family and friends looking after the football pundit's <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> shared the petition, writing: "We hearby endorse this petition. GIVE WRIGHTY A ROASTY! #ImACeleb #TeamIan."</p>
      <p>Fans flocked to Twitter to comment, with one writing: "That last trial was pathetic and unfair, how were they supposed to unscrew and screw the stars when the crabs were in the way. The crabs were too big for the boxes. #farce."</p>
