      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/madonna">Madonna</a> has been accused of failing to credit and pay a songwriter on her 2019 album <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/04/madonna-madame-x-review-her-most-bizarre-album-ever">Madame X</a>.</p>
      <p>Casey Spooner, a member of the recently disbanded electronic pop group Fischerspooner, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5NKzBWqJWg/">wrote on Instagram</a> that he was co-writer of the track God Control. “I have had enough … I’ve gotten no credit and no compensation … while you’re galavanting around on stage I’m completely broke in Berlin. Robbed, ignored and delayed.”</p>
      <p>Spooner said he had been offered first $10,000, then $25,000 as an advance against future publishing royalties, but argued he should instead be paid “1% of touring profits … There is no money in record sales. Period. Not even for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/madonna">Madonna</a>.” In a later Instagram post, he said: “They are trying to intimidate me … it’s not easy fighting giants.”</p>
      <p>Spooner says he worked with God Control producer Mirwais in 2017, for the latter’s solo album, which was later shelved. Elements of their work together later appeared in the Madonna track without his knowledge. He posted a demo version of God Control that he worked on, which features the same lyrics and melody as the Madonna track.</p>

      <p>Madonna has not commented on the accusations. The Guardian has requested comment via her UK representatives.</p>
      <p>God Control, a dance-pop track that confronts gun control in the US, has already provoked controversy. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/26/madonna-calls-for-gun-control-violent-video-nightclub-shooting-god-control">Its violent music video</a> depicted an attack similar to the one on Orlando’s Pulse nightclub in June 2016 that left 49 people dead, and was criticised as “horrible” by Parkland shooting survivor Emma Gonzalez.</p>
