      <h1>Turkey Begins Testing Missile Radars at Heart of Row With U.S.</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:04:38+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/" target="_blank">Firat Kozok</a></address>
      <p>(Bloomberg) -- Turkey will test a a component of its newly acquired Russian air defense system, a step that risks escalating a dispute with the U.S. and touching off possible sanctions. The lira reversed gains.</p>
      <p>Military aircraft will be used in the capital Ankara on Monday and Tuesday during the testing of the S-400 system’s radar-detection equipment, a Turkish defense official said, asking not to be identified in line with his department’s restrictions.</p>
      <p>The decision comes after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that he told President Donald Trump during a meeting this month that Turkey wouldn’t give up on deployment of the systems, risking penalties championed in Congress.</p>
      <p>“So the Turks took them out of the box then. U.S. sanctions?” said Timothy Ash, a strategist at BlueBay Asset Management in London.</p>
      <p>The two NATO allies have been sparring over the potential risks posed by the purchase to Pentagon’s costliest weapons program, the F-35 fighter jet built by Lockheed Martin Corp.</p>
      <p>The Turkish official who talked about the radar tests was elaborating on the Ankara governor’s statement on Sunday that said low- and high-altitude flights by Turkish F-16 warplanes around the capital should be expected on Nov. 25-26.</p>
      <p>The lira reversed earlier gains after the report, was trading 0.4% lower at 5.7365 per dollar at 11:41 a.m. in Istanbul.</p>
