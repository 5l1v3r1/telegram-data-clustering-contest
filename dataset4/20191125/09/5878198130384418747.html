      <p>Kipchoge, who won the same award last year said: “I hope to inspire the human race. I’m just really happy to make history. I hope it was a big inspiration to the next generation.”</p>
      <p>He beat World Cross Country and World 10,000m champion Joshua Cheptegei from Uganda, World 200m champion Noah Lyles (USA), World 400m hurdles champion Karsten Warholm (Norway) and World pole vault champion Sam Kendricks (USA) to retain the award.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old has had a trophy-laden career. He won the London Marathon for a fourth time early this year before he became the first to run a marathon in under two hours, covering the 26.2 miles (42.2km) in one hour 59 minutes 40 seconds in the Ineos 1:59 Challenge in October.</p>
