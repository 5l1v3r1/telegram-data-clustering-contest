      <h1>This Was Hong Kong’s Most Important Election Ever</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:45:39+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:45</time> by <a rel="author">Benny Tai Yiu-ting</a></address>
      <p>HONG KONG — The people of Hong Kong don’t get to choose their government. But that hasn’t stopped them from finding ways to express what they think about it.</p>
      <p>After months of voicing their concerns on the streets, on Sunday they took those to the polling booths. Well beyond any actual protesters who voted in this weekend’s elections, a vast segment of the population cast a protest vote: Many people in the city are now part of a social movement. Hong Kong’s 2019 district council elections may be the most important in the city’s history.</p>
      <p>Despite the steady increase in violence and evermore disruptions over many, many weeks, the Hong Kong government has continued to reject the protesters’ main demands — calls for an independent inquiry into police abuse, amnesty for protesters who were arrested and a clear plan for introducing universal suffrage for the legislative and executive elections. On Sunday, voters rebuked the government for its intransigence, widely favoring candidates running against the establishment and who, in some cases, explicitly endorsed the demonstrators’ demands.</p>
      <p>The turnout rate reached 71.2 percent, by far the highest ever recorded for any election here. By my count, of the 452 seats in the territory’s 18 district councils, pro-democracy candidates won 391, or 86.5 percent of the total. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/world/asia/hong-kong-election-results.html?campaign_id=60&amp;instance_id=0&amp;segment_id=19066&amp;user_id=bd32fbf008e5183a7928ed61c60669f7&amp;regi_id=65413713ing-news&amp;module=inline">Tallies</a> slightly <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3039170/hong-kong-election-takeaways-has-pan-democrat-domination">vary</a>, partly because some candidates’ affiliations defy easy categories.) The pro-democracy camp also seems to have secured a majority in 17 of the 18 district councils. (Also by my count, it garnered about 57.4 percent of the popular vote.)</p>
      <p>The district councils have no direct governing role. They advise the government on local issues like the provision of public facilities and services — garbage collection, traffic congestion. Yet they also matter beyond that immediate mandate, especially these days.</p>
      <p>Thirty-five of the 70 members of the Legislative Council are directly elected by voters in their respective geographical constituencies. One is a district councilor elected by and from among all the district councilors. <a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/education/files/english/Exhibition_Panels_Supplementary_Notes/Composition-of-the-LegCo.pdf">Another five LegCo members</a> are elected by all voters (by proportional representation) from a slate of any candidates nominated by at least 15 district councilors each. LegCo is currently dominated by the pro-establishment camp. The next election is scheduled to take place in September 2020.</p>
      <p>Perhaps even more important, 117 seats are reserved for district councilors on the election committee, the 1,200-member body that chooses Hong Kong’s chief executive. Thanks to the pro-democracy camp’s victory on Sunday and its new commanding majority of district council seats, all 117 of those election committee members will likely be from among its ranks.</p>
      <p>During the election for chief executive in 2017, the pro-democracy camp held around 350 seats of the remaining (nondistrict councilor) 1,083 seats in the election committee. (I say “around 350” because, again, classifications vary and so <a href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/02/27/explainer-hong-kongs-leadership-race-neither-free-fair-representative/">counts </a>do, too.) Even if democrats can hold on to those or do a bit better — the committee will be reconstituted before the next election for chief executive (how? it’s complicated) — they may not reach the simple majority (601 seats) needed to select the next chief executive.</p>
      <p>But the greater their presence on the committee, the more difficult it will be for the Hong Kong government, or the Chinese authorities in Beijing, to manipulate or dominate the selection process. Many of the election committee’s members <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/opinion/%3C%3Cwhy%20%E2%80%9Caround%E2%80%9D%253F%20why%20not%20a%20precise%20number%253F%20And%20a%20link%20to%20a%20source%20for%20the%20figure,%20pls%253F%20this%20article%20says%20327.%3E%3E">represent special interests</a> — the business sector, religious groups, rural associations — and given the new balance of power, some of them, especially the business sector, may now leverage their own votes to ask more from the government.</p>
      <p>In other words, the pro-democracy camp and a collection of nongovernment groups combined have just secured more bargaining power. And if they can work together, they may be able to prevent the Chinese government from placing yet another yes-person, like Carrie Lam, in the chief executive post. Hong Kong’s next leader may still not be directly elected by the people. But there is a better chance that that person won’t have as much license to chip away at Hong Kong’s semiautonomy.</p>
      <p>The pro-democracy camp’s astonishing victory in the district council elections will not — it cannot — fix the democratic deficit patent in Hong Kong’s other institutions. But it is a fresh opportunity to cultivate the city’s democratic spirit. Whether at the grass-roots, community-level work of the district councils or during next year’s LegCo elections or with their even limited sway on the committee that will select Hong Kong’s next leader, the city’s democrats can now lay a solid foundation for the future. When our time comes to fully and freely exercise real democracy, the Hong Kong people will be ready for it.</p>
