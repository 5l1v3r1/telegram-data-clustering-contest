      <h1>Liverpool set to allow striker linked with Bristol City, Leeds United and Aston Villa to leave on loan</h1>
      <h2>There is plenty of competition for his signature</h2>

      <p>Liverpool appear set to allow Rhian Brewster to leave on loan in January.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7720001/Liverpool-willing-let-Rhian-Brewster-leave-loan-January-Aston-Villa-keen-striker.html">The Daily Mail</a> report that Jurgen Klopp has signalled he is happy for the striker to leave Anfield due to a lack of game time so far this season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> have <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-rival-crystal-palace-3490334">previously been linked with the starlet</a> as they are expected to try to bolster their attack in the January transfer window.</p>

      <p>Yet <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">the Robins</a> will face plenty of competition for the 19-year-old's signature.</p>
      <p>Despite Brewster having only played two games of first-team football this season, both coming in the EFL Cup, interest in the teenager his high.</p>
      <p>Previously, Swansea City and Crystal Palace were linked with the striker along with <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">the Robins,</a> but there are now reports that Aston Villa and Leeds United have joined the race.</p>
      <p>Swansea may fancy their chances for landing Brewster, with the striker having won the 2017 under-17 World Cup for England under current Swans boss Steve Cooper.</p>
      <p>Brewster won the golden boot in that competition and signed a five-year contract with Liverpool in 2018.</p>
      <p>Yet he is yet to kick on and play regularly for the Reds, meaning a loan move could well help with his development.</p>
