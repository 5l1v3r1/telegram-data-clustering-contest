      <p>The entertainment industry has received a lot of backlash lately for the lack of support rearing it’s ugly head amongst the artists. A lot of big names in the industry who are appalled by the “pull him down” syndrome is our very own outspoken Ghanaian actress and entrepreneur, Yvonne Nelson.</p>

      <p>Yvonne Nelson who could not fathom why a lot of hate is projected in the industry took to her Twitter page to express her disappointment.</p>
      <p>according to Yvonne Nelson, instead of discrediting Shatta Wale’s nomination in the Grammy’s, he should be rather celebrated for putting Ghana on the Global market.</p>
      <p>Yvonne Nelson is not the only one against the issue under discussion.<br/>The likes of Fuse ODG spoke strongly against the non support meted out to Shatta Wale after he posted on his Twitter page of his Grammy’s nomination on the ticket of Beyonce’s nomination. He quizzed why Ghanaians hated supporting their own and rather pledge their allegiance to foreigners.</p>
      <p>Yvonne Nelson wrote;<br/>The HATE in this industry..Shatta Wale has put GH on the map!!! Y’all should be happy for him. I can’t believe even radio discussions are trying to discredit him, what at all should one do?? Ghana is proud of you SHATTA! Congrats”.</p>
      <p>It is about time the disunity in the entertainment industry is brought to an abrupt end else the future generations are doomed.</p>
