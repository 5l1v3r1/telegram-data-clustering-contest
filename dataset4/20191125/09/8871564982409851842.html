      <h1>8-year-old girl attacked by family pit bull in critical condition</h1>

      <p>An 8-year-old girl, identified by her initial M, is reportedly in critical condition after her family’s pit bull attacked her on Saturday in the North Sumatra capital of Medan.</p>
      <p>According to reports, M was playing alone with the pit bull when the canine attacked her, leaving severe injuries on her face and around her head.</p>
      <p>“Right now, she’s in the ICU. She is not yet stable, sometimes she’s conscious, sometimes she snores. She’s an eight-year-old who just underwent surgery, so, understandably, she’s lost a lot of energy,” Jefri, M’s father, said today, <a href="https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4797100/bocah-di-medan-yang-digigit-pitbull-masih-dirawat-di-icu">as quoted by </a><a href="https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4797100/bocah-di-medan-yang-digigit-pitbull-masih-dirawat-di-icu"><i>Detik</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Jefri said no one knows what triggered the pit bull to attack M as no one else was around when it happened.</p>
      <p>The details of M’s injuries were not specified and medical professionals have not released any statement on her chances of recovery.</p>
      <p>This is not the first pit bull attack on a child in Indonesia in recent years. In 2017, an 8-year-old in Malang, East Java was <a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/police-believe-8-year-old-girl-mauled-killed-foster-familys-pit-bull-malang/">mauled and killed by a pit bull</a> belonging to her foster family. Police say it was likely that the girl dropped her doll near the dog, which startled it and caused it to attack the girl when she got near.</p>
      <p>The ferocious canine has also been used as an attack dog. Last year, a man in Central Jakarta <a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/man-sics-pitbull-security-guard-telling-keep-dog-leash-might-get-pet-back/">set his pit bull on a security guard</a> after the latter told him to keep the dog on a leash. The dog owner was eventually <a href="https://www.suara.com/news/2019/01/18/221644/serang-satpam-polisi-tetapkan-pemilik-anjing-pitbull-sebagai-tersangka">charged with assault</a>.  </p>
