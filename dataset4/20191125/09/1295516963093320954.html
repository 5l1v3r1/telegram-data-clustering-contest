          <b>WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Disney's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/frozen-2/">Frozen 2</a>, in theaters now.</b>

      </p>
      <p>Olaf is one of the most famous characters in the <i>Frozen</i> franchise, a perky living snowman created by Elsa's powers. His eternal optimism in the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/frozen/">first film</a> made him a favorite of younger audiences. <a href="https://www.cbr.com/disney-pulling-frozen-short-from-coco/">Animated shorts</a> have even focused on his adventures following the events of the first movie.</p>
      <p>However, in <i>Frozen 2</i>, Olaf has matured a little -- and become despondent about what he's learned about the world.  It makes for a surprisingly depressing story arc for the snowman that isn't what you'd expect from a character who's more often associated with comic relief.</p>

      <h3>GETTING OLDER</h3>

      <p>When <i>Frozen 2</i> starts, Olaf expresses a desire for the world to remain exactly as it is. His verse in the opening song "Some Things Never Change" is about how much he doesn't want his life to ever be different. While he doesn't age physically, he's been mentally growing into a more complex and complicated figure the longer he's existed. When he's greeted by the children of Arendelle, he acts like a nostalgic young adult. While there's a recognition that he doesn't know everything about the world, he's sadly learned more about how the world works and understands that there are things he doesn't understand.</p>
      <p>Notably, he's become depressed by the fact that life has a habit of changing. Nonetheless, the danger of reawakened magic sends him and the rest of his friends into the Enchanted Forest far to the north, with the guarantee that change is about to happen.</p>

      <h3>THE PROBLEM WITH THE WORLD</h3>

      <p>Olaf's desperately convinces himself that all his concerns about change will be eased when he gets older and that growing up answers every question one can have about life. He doesn't comprehend that his adult friends Elsa, Anna and Kristoff are still dealing with their own fears and uncertainties. Olaf expresses this belief initially during the song "When I'm Older," which highlights his lack the awareness that things don't ever fully make sense. Olaf has to learn to deal with change, as we all do at some point in our lives.</p>
      <p>In fact, in <i>Frozen 2</i>, Olaf has to deal with the most devastating change of all: death. His inability to understand the concept fully was a recurring joke in the first film, but in this movie, he's forced to face it head-on. After Elsa is frozen solid, which cuts off her powers from the rest of the world, Olaf -- and presumably all the other snow creatures she created in the past -- falls apart. He can feel that something is wrong, but there's nothing he can do to stop it. He can only stay with Anna and try to comfort <i>her</i> as he slowly disintegrates into snowflakes and drifts away on the wind.</p>
      <p>Even though he does come back to life when Elsa is revived, he doesn't seem to recognize the sheer scope of what he went through. He just makes some jokes and admits that, while he doesn't know everything, he'll continue to grow. It is a weirdly <i>dark</i> turn for the film to take with the typically comedic character. Even his few comic moments in the film have a dark edge to them. It's a weird direction for Disney to take the character, even if it does fit with the overall trajectory of the film.</p>
