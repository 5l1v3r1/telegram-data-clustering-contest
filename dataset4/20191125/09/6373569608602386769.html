      <h2>The laws give tenants new powers</h2>

      <p>Tenants can now sue landlords over poor living conditions thanks to a new law.</p>
      <p>Anyone living in rented accommodation now have powers to take their landlord to court over issues such as mould and and cold conditions in their homes.</p>
      <p>The new law means landlords will be made to carry out necessary repairs and bring rented homes up to scratch,<a href="https://www.kentlive.news/news/kent-news/tenants-can-sue-landlords-cold-3573317"> Kent Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>The Landlord and Tenant Act of 1985 was updated with the new Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act in March.</p>
      <p>The new law applies to tenancies of less than seven years in England and Wales and came into effect on March 20.</p>

      <p>Renters can go to the courts if the property is deemed unfit for living.</p>
      <p>One of the interesting things about the new act is what qualifies as 'unfit for living'.</p>
      <p>Under the new law, tenants can take action if there are issues with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>repair</li>
        <li>stability</li>
        <li>damp</li>
        <li>internal arrangement</li>
        <li>natural lighting</li>
        <li>ventilation</li>
        <li>water supply</li>
        <li>drainage and sanitary conveniences</li>
        <li>facilities for preparation and cooking of food and for the disposal of waste water</li>
        <li>hazards under the Housing Health and Safety Rating System</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Housing organisation Shelter say they welcome the legislation and said that the Bill covers the "glaring omissions" of previous legislation to include damp and mould.</p>
      <p>"Crucially, the Bill will help private and social renter’s voices to be heard, by giving them the right to take their landlord to court over unfit and unsafe conditions like these in their home," they wrote in a blog post.</p>
      <p>"There are currently almost one million rented homes with hazards that pose a serious risk to health and safety. This affects around 2.5 million people, who’ll all benefit from this landmark change in the law.</p>
      <p>"The Bill could help to prevent another tragedy like the Grenfell tower fire. This was the starkest reminder of the dangers of unsafe accommodation."</p>
      <p>Instead of complaining to the local council, renters can now go straight to the courts and get the changes done that are needed.</p>
      <p>Landlords who get things fixed when asked to and look after their tenants should not have to worry but failure to keep a property fit for human habitation will cause problems.</p>
      <p>A successful court order might require a landlord to take action regarding a certain hazard or to compensate a tenant with damages.</p>
      <p>It does not force a landlord to rebuild a dwelling that has been destroyed or damaged by fire, flood or any other natural occurence.</p>
