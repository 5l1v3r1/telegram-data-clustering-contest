      <h1>Aston Villa reject put up for £1m January transfer - reports</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa transfer news includes former AVFC midfielder transfer-listed by West Ham United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:44:14+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:44</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>West Ham United are ready to end Carlos Sanchez’s disastrous spell at the club in January, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> midfielder has struggled to make an impact at the London Stadium since arriving from Fiorentina last year.</p>
      <p>A long-term knee injury, which kept Sanchez out for seven months, disrupted his first season at the Hammers and he hasn’t fared much better this term.</p>
      <p>The Colombia international has played just four times in the Premier League since August, and although he came on a second-half substitute against Tottenham on Saturday, West Ham are preparing to cut ties.</p>

      <p>Sanchez is a free agent at the end of the season but his club are willing to sell for as little as £1m in January in order to force through a sale, according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10408697/west-ham-sell-carlos-sanchez/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballtwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574614249">the Sun.</a></p>
      <p>They report that Sanchez would like to stay in England but at 33, could struggle to find another side willing to take a punt on him.</p>
      <p>Sanchez joined Villa in a hail of publicity for £4.7m after the 2014 World Cup.</p>
      <p>But he ended up playing just two of the four seasons he signed up for, managing just 57 appearances in the process, and when Villa were relegated he was sent on loan to Fiorentina before joining them permanently.</p>
      <p>He played on loan for Espanyol before signing for West Ham - and in an interview last year discussed his struggles at Villa.</p>
      <p>“The manager who wanted me and signed me, Paul Lambert, was there for just six months," Sanchez told <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5905111/Carlos-Sanchez-angry-seeing-red-group-stages-against-Japan-ahead-England-tie.html">the Daily Mail.</a> "In the next year-and-a-half, we changed managers five times. How do you work in such a situation?”</p>
