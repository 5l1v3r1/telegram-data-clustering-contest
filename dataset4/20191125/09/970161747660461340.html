      <p>After a long and tiring day, the camp were deciding which order the celebrities would participate in the next live challenge.</p>
      <p>As well as stars for the group, winners of the challenge would win a roast dinner in the Jungle Dining Room for one camp mate, based on descending order that the team must decide on beforehand. Therefore those in position one, two and so on had a higher chance of getting a roast dinner.</p>

      <p>The celebs decided the the women of the camp would go at the top with the men afterwards.</p>
      <p>James declared that the men should ‘agree that the women go first and cut all that chivalrous nonense’.</p>
      <p>The Good Morning Britain presenter snapped back: ‘But that is chivalrous nonsense’.</p>
      <p>When James demanded that Kate ‘just go with it’, she replied: ‘I’m allowed to have a view too’.</p>

      <p>The rugby player added: ‘We don’t need a debate, women go first, men after that.’</p>
      <p>Viewers described James as ‘irritating’ and accused him of ‘shutting down’ Kate.</p>
      <p>‘I appreciate chivalry like James is trying to show, but I can’t STAND the fact that he was so aggressively insistent that he wouldn’t even let Kate speak. Offer a chivalrous act, but be prepared to be turned down and all will be happy. Equality and understanding,’ read one comment on Twitter.</p>

      <p>One fan fumed: ‘James needs stop dictating that women HAVE to go first, if kate doesn’t want to she doesn’t want to m8 back off.’</p>
      <p>‘Don’t see how James Haskell was a gentleman at all? He literally pushed the women to go first even though they said they didn’t want to, to make himself look like a hero, and then said he’s having good manners?’ read another tweet.</p>
      <p>One comment said: ‘James is being ridiculous. Kate is equally entitled to an opinion’, while another read: ‘There’s being chivalrous and there’s forcing women to go first and not letting them offer a response or rebuttal. I’m not finding James noble, I’m finding him irritating and domineering.’</p>

      <p>Perhaps the lack of food was making him irritable, as he also <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/declan-donnelly-hits-back-james-haskell-awkward-im-celebrity-clash-go-11213250/">snapped at hosts Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly</a> during <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/im-celebrity-fans-demand-justice-james-haskell-roman-kemp-impossible-bushtucker-trial-11212111/">a particularly tricky trial</a> with Roman Kemp.</p>
