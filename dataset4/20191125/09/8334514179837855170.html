      <p>MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia’s domestic spy agency is investigating whether China tried to install an agent in federal parliament in what Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday called “deeply disturbing” allegations.</p>

        <figcaption><b>Defector details China interference in Australia<br/></b>Australia dealt with two allegations against China over the weekend, one pertaining to a supposed plot to install a Chinese agent in Australia's federal parliament, and the other coming from a Chinese defector who has spoken of Beijing's efforts to meddle in Australia, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Jayson Albano reports.</figcaption>

      <p>The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) said it had launched an investigation before the alleged plot was reported by Australia’s “60 Minutes” program and affiliated newspapers on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The reports said a suspected Chinese espionage ring had offered “a seven figure sum” to pay for a Melbourne luxury car dealer, Bo “Nick” Zhao, to run for a seat in Australia’s federal parliament.</p>
      <p>“The reporting on Nine’s ‘60 Minutes’ contains allegations that ASIO takes seriously,” ASIO Director-General of Security Mike Burgess said in the statement on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Australians can be reassured that ASIO was previously aware of matters that have been reported today, and has been actively investigating them.”</p>
      <p>Officials at China’s embassy in Canberra were not immediately available for comment.</p>
      <p>“I find the allegations deeply disturbing and troubling,” Morrison told reporters in Canberra, adding the government had beefed up Australia’s laws and security agencies to counter foreign interference.</p>
      <p>“Australia is not naive to the threats that it faces more broadly,” he added, without commenting on the specific allegations.</p>
      <p>Resource-rich Australia’s ties with its most important trading partner China have deteriorated in recent years, amid accusations that Beijing is meddling in domestic affairs.</p>
      <p>The government has set up a counter-foreign interference coordinator and given the intelligence and security agencies additional resources to protect Australians and the nation’s institutions, a government spokesman said.</p>

      <p>Car dealer Zhao told ASIO about the alleged approach from another Melbourne businessman about a year ago, the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper said in the joint report with “60 Minutes” and The Age newspaper, citing Zhao’s associates and Western security sources.</p>
      <p>Zhao was found dead in March in a Melbourne motel room and police have been unable to conclude how he died, the newspaper said.</p>
      <p>ASIO’s Burgess said he would not comment further and the death was subject to a coronial inquiry.</p>
      <p>“Hostile foreign intelligence activity continues to pose a real threat to our nation and its security. ASIO will continue to confront and counter foreign interference and espionage in Australia,” he said.</p>
      <p>The latest allegations came a day after media reported that a Chinese defector, who said he was an intelligence operative, told ASIO how China had funded and conducted political interference in Taiwan, Australia and Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>The man, Wang Liqiang, is seeking asylum in Australia with his wife and young son.</p>
      <p>Morrison said his asylum claim would be assessed on its merits, based on any “reasonable fear of persecution in their home country”.</p>
      <p>Responding to the media reports, Chinese police said the “so-called China spy” was a 26-year-old convicted fraudster from the eastern province of Fujian.</p>
      <p>Wang’s account sparked an angry reaction in the influential state-owned tabloid Global Times on Monday, which said: “Chinese people would intuitively know that Wang sounds like an opportunistic liar, probably a swindler.”</p>
      <p>The newspaper said someone of Wang’s age would have been “in a training or intern programme” if they were in the national security department. It added that it was very rare for a person in China’s national security establishment to have a child at such a young age.</p>

      <p>“If Australia’s intelligence agency really believed Wang, it would have taken secret counter-espionage actions instead of letting the media expose it,” the Global Times said.</p>
      <p>ASIO has not commented on any counter-espionage actions it may have taken in response to Wang’s claims.</p>
