        <b>Michael van Gerwen says Gerwyn Price needs to get a few more titles under his belt before he can claim to have a proper rivalry with the world number one.</b>
      </p>
      <p>MVG beat the Iceman 11-9 in a thrilling Players Championship final on Sunday night, gaining revenge for the Welshman’s win over him in the Grand Slam semi-finals the previous week.</p>
      <p>Price got himself in a great position at 8-7 ahead, but could not convert the advantage into a consecutive victory over Mighty Mike, falling just short.</p>
      <p>Undoubtedly the two form players on the planet going into the World Championship in December, there is plenty of expectation over the growing rivalry between the two.</p>
      <p>Van Gerwen has plenty of respect for Price, but says the world number three needs to win an awful lot more than just two major titles to be considered anything like his equal.</p>

      <p>‘Maybe, but he first needs to start winning a little bit more, I think he’s only won two tournaments so far,’ said Van Gerwen after his victory in Minehead. ‘I’ve won more than 150 PDC titles.</p>
      <p>‘Of course, he’s doing so good lately, he’s turned the crowd on his side and he deserves every credit.</p>
      <p>‘It will be a great rivalry but I need to first show who is really the boss and that’s me today.’</p>

      <p>Van Gerwen’s comparison of title hauls is a touch unfair as Price has won nine PDC titles, he just has two majors to his name, while MVG has 35 majors on his CV.</p>
      <p>His point remains, though, the world champion has won plenty more silverware than the latest pretender to his throne.</p>
      <p>Mighty Mike also holds a fabulous record against the Iceman, with that Grand Slam loss the only defeat in a 20-1-1 head-to-head history.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the Dutchman is a big fan of the Welshman’s passion and talent and can see plenty more exciting contests between the two in the future.</p>
      <p>‘I could have done better, I should have focused myself a little bit more, because I gave him too many chances,’ Van Gerwen told Live Darts.</p>
      <p>‘When you give him chances, with his fighting spirit, which is why I like him, then he’s dangerous.</p>

      <p>‘Lately he does really well, especially for the darts, I think he’s good to watch and fair play to him.</p>
      <p>‘Of course I had to get him off the stage, and he said to me “you deserve that one.”</p>
      <p>‘I had to work really hard for that. It’s nice that people enjoy games between us, even if we didn’t perform our A-game.’</p>
      <p>Attention now turns to the World Championship, beginning on Friday 13 December at Alexandra Palace and MVG wants to retain his world title for the first time in his career to date.</p>
      <p>‘I will look now towards the World Championship and it will be my goal to keep hold of that title too, but that’s a couple of weeks away so I will enjoy this win first,’ said the 30-year-old.</p>
