      <p>Xiaomi has officially started teasing us about the launch of a 108MP camera smartphone in India. The company announced the Mi CC9 Pro earlier this month with the world's first 108MP Penta-camera setup. The same phone debuted in Europe as the Mi Note 10 Pro.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi Global VP &amp; MD, India, Manu Kumar Jain has tweeted, "IT'S COMING #108MP" and while he didn't reveal the name of the phone, we suspect it to be the Mi Note 10 series. That or it will be an all-new phone rocking a 108MP camera sensor.</p>
      <p>The Chinese electronics maker hasn't really released a Mi branded premium phone in the Indian market since Mi Mix 2. Though it's Android One lineup of Mi A-series has received a third sequel this year.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi Mi CC9 Pro is priced starting at CNY 2,799 in China which is roughly around Rs 28,500, going up to CNY2,499 (~Rs 35,500) for the top-end model. We expect the prices in India to be between Rs 29,999 and Rs 39,999 making the phone compete against the likes of Realme X2 Pro and OnePlus 7T. </p>
