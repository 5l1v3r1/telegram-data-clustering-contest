      </p>
      <p>Urban grooves musician Plaxedes Machuma Joka (popularly known as Plaxedes Wenyika) who recently set tongues wagging on social media after posting<a href="https://iharare.com/plaxedes-wenyika-moves-on-with-new-hottie/"> photographs with her alleged new youthful lover,</a> has revealed the reason behind the controversial photographs.</p>
      <p>The musician’s pictures with her new alleged lover attracted ire from social media commentators who accused her of luring the young man with financial favours. In an exclusive interview with the local publication, Daily News on Sunday, Plaxedes revealed that the controversial photographs were behind the scenes snippets from her forthcoming music video, <b><i>Zvekare</i></b>.</p>

      <aside>It’s time for the big reveal. The reason why you guys were seeing all those interesting posts was because they are actually taken from a video I’m releasing on Monday.<br/>People will then totally and finally get to understand what was behind all the ‘madness’.</aside>
      <p>This comes after Plaxedes’s <a href="https://www.herald.co.zw/plaxedes-wenyika-marriage-on-rocks-singer-demands-6-000-maintenance/">nasty break-up</a> with Corporate 24 medical centre founder Dr Mike Joka last year.<br/>The couple’s 13-year marriage fell apart after the artiste filed for divorce citing ‘irreconcilable differences’ with the entrepreneur. The couple married in 2005 in terms of the Marriages Act (Chapter 5:11). In the divorce summons filed at the High Court in 2018, Wenyika claimed monthly maintenance of $3 500 for herself and upkeep of the couple’s three children.</p>
      <p>However, iHarare has noted that of late, popular musicians have been releasing pictures of themselves in apparently controversial or compromising situations, as a marketing gimmick.</p>
