      <h1>A private company to invest US$5 M to build natural resort at Htiparunu cave</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author">Ma Khaing (Loikaw)</a></address>
      <p>A private company is planning to invest US$5 million to build a natural resort and to develop a tourism plan at the Htiparunu cave in Pruhso Township, Kayah State and is planned to open in 2020, according to the state government office.</p>
      <p>The investor is Sutpike Company and visitors can tour inside the Htiparunu cave, about 50 acres large, as well as plans for leisure cycling and renting of bungalows.</p>
      <p>The company will operate the natural resort under BoT system and the state government and company signed an agreement during September. The construction process will be started in coming December.</p>
      <p>“We told the company to operate systematically. The visitors throw rubbish and villagers have to collect them to burn down. We are worried that the water will be polluted. Water flowing from the cave reached villages and streams. Many animals are living near the cave. If many people came here, they will run away,” said Catherine from Mawthido Village near the cave.</p>
      <p>A total of 23 villages submitted a protest letter to the state chief minister in 2017 for fear of damaging the environment and social life near the cave. The state’s planning and finance minister and natural resources and environment minister came to meet with locals and environmental community organizations and they got quarreled with the planning and finance minister, according to locals.</p>
      <p>The locals said they are against the project as it can harm their living, damage eco system, make environmental pollution, affect livestock farming in the forest and occur social and religious problems.</p>
      <p>Mawthido Village is torn by war and the village was called “Widows Village” as many men in the village were killed by landmines. The men are often forcibly recruiters as porters and as sacrificial hostages sweep mines.</p>
      <p>The cave is located near Mawthido Village where ethnic Kayaw race lived and water resources from the cave are about ten miles away from Pruhso and Demawso.</p>
      <p>The locals used the cave since the ancestors and local and foreign researchers came to make research about the cave and tour companies brought the visitors for recreation after the government had an agreement with the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP).</p>
      <p>The Htiparunu cave has a small waterfall, an underground river, underground caves with entries and exits in addition to stalactites, according to locals.</p>
      <p>Kayah State Chief Minister and cabinet members visited the cave on February 25, 2017 to find a new place for community based tourism.</p>
