      <h1>Start And Manage A Book Club With This App</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/author/emily-price" target="_blank">Emily Price</a></address>
      <p>Book clubs are one of the things that are notoriously hard to manage.</p>
      <p>Sure, if you’re lucky you have a group of friends who are all always available on the same day to meet and all have the exact same taste in books so picking your next one is an easy proposition. More than likely; however, you have friends with crazy schedules that can make finding a mutual day to meet a nightmare, and finding your next book sometimes involves deliberating the options so long that you probably could have just read all the choices.</p>
      <p><a href="https://bookclubz.com/">Bookclubz</a> is an app that can help.</p>
      <p>The service has been available online for a while but launched an app for iOS and Android last week. With it, you can create a group for your book club, send invites for the meeting (and collect RSVPs so you know how many people are coming), and poll members about when the next meeting should take place or what you should read next.</p>

      <p>Once your group finishes a book, you can rate it within the app. You can also see all the books your book club has read in the past, in case you’re trying to make a recommendation to a friend and can’t remember, as well as see what other book clubs are reading around the country, should you need a little inspiration.</p>
      <p>The site and app are free to use and can be a great resource to keep everything organised, especially if your group is on the larger side.</p>
