      <p>Twelve points behind their city rivals and the same games played after Saturday’s 1-0 defeat in Inverness, the Dark Blues have to make sure they get back to winning ways before they can think about reeling in the team above them, according to the experienced midfielder.</p>
      <p>“We’ve just got to focus on the next game,” said Ness.</p>
      <p>“There has probably been too much talk of challenging, winning the league and that sort of thing.</p>
      <p>“Obviously Dundee United are massive favourites.</p>
      <p>“We won’t be giving up. Twelve points is obviously a big gap but we just have to put points on the board and get up the table.</p>
      <p>“We believe we have the players to do that but we have to show it.”</p>
