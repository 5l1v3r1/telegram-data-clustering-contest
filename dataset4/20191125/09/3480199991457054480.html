      <p>However, you know, Nigel, that Johnson is an inveterate liar who can’t be trusted to run a garden let alone a country. Even his old boss the owner of the Telegraph admitted he lied to him, as he lied to the Queen.</p>
      <p>But one thing that he will be forever damned for is the plight of a lady who is undergoing the horrors of life in an Iranian jail, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, thanks to the gross incompetence of Johnson.</p>
      <p>Did you Nigel, and other Tory supporters conveniently forget this lady, or is it that if you close your eyes and your minds she may conveniently go away? Johnson is a national disgrace!</p>
