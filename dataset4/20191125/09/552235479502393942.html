      <h1>Rangers will overthrow Celtic as champions and any manager can win in Scotland says former England boss</h1>
      <h2>Sam Allardyce reckons the Ibrox club is on an upward trajectory.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:46:09+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:46</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>Sam Allardyce has dismissed the successes of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> bosses and claimed all managers can come to Scotland and win silverware.</p>
      <p>The comments were made as part of a wider debate about managers having to win titles or cups to be considered for top jobs in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Burnley boss Sean Dyche has been linked with Everton but a talkSPORT caller claimed that without tangible success, top clubs would always look to managers with a track record of success.</p>
      <p>Host Alan Brazil suggested that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> ' reason to go to Celtic was to become a winner and rehabilitate his reputation after coming so close to the title at Liverpool.</p>

      <p>But Allardyce, was unimpressed.</p>
      <p>He said: "We can all go to Celtic and win trophies.</p>
      <p>"It will be <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> soon the way they are going under <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> .</p>
      <p>"Fans expect you to win trophies and if you don't do that then you'd get the sack.</p>
      <p>"I agree with what Brendan was saying and it was a great move for him because it built his reputation again.</p>
      <p>"But I didn't think there was anything wrong with him because he was brilliant at Liverpool, just a bad patch of recruitment cost him his job."</p>
