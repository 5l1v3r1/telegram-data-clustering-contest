      <h1>The Big Bang Theory’s Best Star Wars Homages</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:11:56+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:11</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Cardona</a></address>
      <p>In less than a month, the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-episode-ix/">Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</a> will finally hit theaters. As the holidays approach, fans are also preparing ready for the epic finale of the Skywalker Saga, and many will almost certainly plan a re-watch of all the films before the release of <i>Episode IX</i>. But Lucasfilm and Disney's movies aren't all you can re-watch to get ready for <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i>.</p>
      <p>In fact, if you are a fan of the insanely popular <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-big-bang-theory/">The Big Bang Theory</a>, then you know there are plenty of episodes you can add to your <i>Star Wars</i> marathon. The hit CBS sitcom, which focused on four geeky scientists, has often worn its <i>Star Wars</i> heart on its sleeve throughout its 12 season run. And it wasn't just the odd joke, comment or reference. Sometimes, <i>Star Wars</i> was a part of the story.</p>
      <p>Here is a list of <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>'s best homages to a galaxy far, far away.</p>

      <h3>The Skywalker Incursion</h3>

      <p>In the Season 8 episode "The Skywalker Incursion," Sheldon and Leonard go out of town for a lecture on the duo's new paper. With their road trip going faster than expected, the two best friends have a bit of time to kill and realize they are close to Skywalker Ranch, the fabled home of George Lucas and everything else <i>Star Wars</i>.</p>

      <p>Thanks to a malfunctioning speaker, the two scientists are actually able to get through the gate. However, the intrusion of a security guard leads Sheldon to make a desperate run for it. Unfortunately, the only room in Skywalker Ranch the pair end up visiting is the detention room. But even then, for fans of <i>Star Wars</i>, the detention room is better than nothing -- it's an achievement in and of itself.</p>
      <h3>The Weekend Vortex</h3>

      <p>When the cast of <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> grew with the inclusion of Bernadette and Amy, the CBS series evolved into something different. Now, it wasn't just about four geeks and their neighbor -- it was about relationships and adulthood... with the occasional <i>Star Wars</i> online video game marathon. In "The Weekend Vortex," in a bid to relive the glory of the old days, Raj, who is now the only one not in a relationship in his group of friends, plans a weekend with only his three best friends to play the new <i>Star Wars</i> video game.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, the plan is easier said than done. Sheldon, who had agreed to go to a party in Amy's family, has a difficult time freeing himself to take part in the gaming. What's more, Howard ends up accidentally inviting Bernadette. But eventually, Raj gets exactly what he wants, and the group gets to play the <i>Star Wars</i> video game installment for a full weekend, non-stop.</p>
      <h3>The Opening Night Excitation</h3>

      </figure>
      <p><i>The Big Bang Theory</i>'s Season 9 episode begins with the perfect homage to <i>Star Wars</i>. On a black screen, a familiar blue font appears with a text that reads: "A short time ago in an apartment in Pasadena..." Then, John Williams' iconic <i>Star Wars</i> theme begins blaring, as a yellow <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> logo appears over a starry background. It's followed by the episode's number and title, which both scroll through. Then, a short text explains the guys are getting ready to purchase tickets for the opening night showing of the (then) highly anticipated <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i>.</p>

      <p>The episode humorously shows the determination <i>Star Wars</i> fans have, as it perfectly replicates the experience of purchasing highly sought-after tickets online. Thankfully, they are able to secure their tickets -- a joyous success we are all familiar with.</p>
      <h3>The Bow Tie Asymmetry</h3>

        <img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Mark-Hamill-The-Big-Bang-Theory.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=520&amp;dpr=1.5"/>

      <p>Luke Skywalker himself dropped by <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> in the Season 11 finale, "The Bow Tie Asymmetry." In the episode, the entire gang is preparing for Sheldon and Amy's wedding. While the plan is for <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>'s Wil Wheaton to officiate the ceremony, everything changes when Howard finds a lost dog in his backyard. After calling the owner, a knock on the door reveals Howard has actually rescued Mark Hamill's dog, Bark Hamill.</p>

      <p>The thankful <i>Star Wars</i> actor asks what he can do in return, and Howard arranges for him to officiate the wedding in Wheaton's stead. Every character's reaction to seeing the star of their favorite movie series is priceless, as is the series of <i>Star Wars-</i>related questions Hamill is pestered by at the wedding.</p>
      <h3>The Proton Transmogrification</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Finally, the Season 7 episode "The Proton Transmogrification" is where <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> went full <i>Star Wars</i>. In this classic episode, the entire gang celebrates May the 4th, aka Star Wars Day, by watching all six films while wearing their favorite t-shirts from a galaxy far, far away and devouring a Death Star cake.</p>

      <p>But the episode doesn't stop there. Following the death of Sheldon's idol Professor Proton (played by Bob Newhart), the late scientist appears to Sheldon in a dream as a Jedi Force Ghost. The episode not only features the use of a lightsaber, but it also sets a scene in the Dagobah swamps and uses the music and sound effects from the very films it's emulating.</p>
      <p>The Big Bang Theory<i> ran for 12 seasons on CBS. The series stars Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki, Kaley Cuoco, Mayim Bialik, Kunal Nayyar, Simon Helberg and Melissa Rauch. </i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker<i> hits theaters Dec. 20.</i></p>
