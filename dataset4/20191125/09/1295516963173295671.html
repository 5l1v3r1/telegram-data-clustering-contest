      <p>As the build-up to <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-episode-ix/">Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</a> enters its final month, Lucasfilm has revealed a new special look at the final chapter in the "Skywalker Saga," looking back on the monumental cultural influence <i>Star Wars</i> has had over the past four decades.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mml9IGoDia8&amp;feature=youtu.be">promo</a> contains countless examples of the beloved Space opera franchise's influence, from the <i>Star Wars</i> fever that first swept the nation back in the '70s and '80s, to <i>The Force Awakens</i> and <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> director J.J Abrams recalling the first time he saw the words "Star Wars," to various times the series has been referenced in other pieces of pop culture.</p>

      <p>Also included are numerous behind-the-scenes clips from the Original Trilogy, Prequel Trilogy and Sequel Trilogy (which concludes with <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i>) -- not to mention clips of <i>Star Wars</i> actors and fans alike expressing what the franchise means to them and the world around them. "It's about family and that's what's so powerful about it," said the late, great Carrie Fisher. "They're sharing something that moved them."</p>
      <p>The video concludes with a clip from <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i>, which sees the new trinity of Rey, Finn and Poe Dameron sitting in the Millennium Falcon with Chewbacca and C-3pO. This scene is accompanied by an old clip of Luke Skywalker actor Mark Hamill talking about what it was like to conclude the Original Trilogy with 1983's<i> Return of the Jedi</i>. "You're glad that you're finishing," Hamill says. "But savoring every moment because you know it is the last."</p>
