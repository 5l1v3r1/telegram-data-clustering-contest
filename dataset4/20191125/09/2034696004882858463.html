      <p>Emily Eavis has heightened speculation that <a href="http://nme.com/artists/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a> and<a href="http://nme.com/artists/kendrick-lamar"> Kendrick Lamar</a> will top the bill at <a href="http://nme.com/festivals/glastonbury">Glastonbury 2020</a> after confirming that the two remaining headlining acts have never played the festival before.</p>
      <p>Despite the fact that neither artist has made their Worthy Farm debut yet, the pair are currently leading the bookies’ odds for a top slot at Glastonbury’s 50th anniversary event next year.</p>

      <p>Eavis told Zoe Ball on BBC Radio 2: “Interestingly, for the other two headliners it’s their first time at Glastonbury and we’ve got one male and one female – so there’s a couple of clues there. I’m sure people will guess, so don’t put them to me!”</p>
      <p>It comes a week after Paul McCartney was <a href="https://www.nme.com/festivals/glastonbury/paul-mccartney-confirms-glastonbury-slot-cryptic-twitter-post-2568890">confirmed as the first headliner</a> for Glastonbury’s 50th anniversary – marking his first appearance at the festival since 2004.</p>
      <p>Eavis said of McCartney’s headline slot: “It’s amazing having him back. It’s the ultimate way to celebrate.”</p>

      <p>Paul McCartney will headline Glastonbury 2020</p>
      <p>While it’s yet to be confirmed when the rest of the line-up will arrive, Eavis hinted that the identity of a second headliner could be revealed “this side of Christmas”.</p>
      <p>“Most of it will be [announced in] the beginning of 2020. Everyone needs their moment,” she explained.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, Swift is receiving bookies odds as low as 3/10, followed by Kendrick Lamar at 4/11.</p>
      <p>Last weekend, Michael Eavis also hinted that Swift <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/taylor-swift-set-to-play-glastonbury-2020-headliner-2571154">could be set to headline Glastonbury 2020 in a new interview.</a></p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p07t4snh">BBC Somerset</a>, Eavis said: “I’ve got two of my favourite headliners… already booked […] I can’t tell you the second one […] you would love her to bits… everybody does […] but no names at the moment…”</p>
      <p>Swift, who’s <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/taylor-swift-announces-2020-uk-european-festival-tour-2548885">performing a run of European festival dates as part of her summer 2020 ‘Lover’ Tour</a>, is likely to take the Sunday (June 28) slot at Worthy Farm as she’s currently scheduled to play in Oslo on the Friday evening (June 26).</p>
