      <p>"Quikmile's team will now be a part of Airtel X Labs Airtel's digital innovation factory, which focuses on IoT, Digital Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning," Airtel said in a statement.</p>

We see a massive opportunity to solve problems for this segment through scalable technology solutions and workforce management platforms that will make organisations much more efficient," Harmeen Mehta, Global CIO and Director - Engineering, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bharti-airtel">Bharti Airtel </a>said.</p>
