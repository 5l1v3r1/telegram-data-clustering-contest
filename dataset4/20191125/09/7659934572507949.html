      <p>The success of the “advanced” regional administration program in Morocco is mainly linked to granting real and strong power to regional governments to increase their competitiveness, Moroccan Prime Minister Saadeddine el-Othmani has announced.<br/><br/>Speaking at the inauguration of the National Forum on the program in Kenitra, Othmani asserted that the government had made strides in administrative decentralization, with three sectors remaining to be resolved.<br/><br/>He stressed that these projects establish a new reality with the contribution of the Justice and Development Party (PJD).<br/><br/>Othmani, who is PJD’s Secretary-General, noted there was some ambiguity about the transfer of powers and their execution time frame.<br/><br/>He added that it requires legislative amendments that put the appropriate foundation for decentralization.<br/><br/>Othmani stressed that the PJD has the right to defend itself when attacked, describing party members as “fighters” who are part of important workshops that contribute to the history of the country.<br/><br/>The Prime Minister reiterated his party's rejection of what he called “bullying, as well as illegal interventions, which are not beneficial,” referring to the difficulties and suffering that he claimed a number of heads of institutions, who are PJD members, are subjected to.<br/><br/>He warned that attempts to harm the nation, misappropriate public funds, and breach the law, are considered a “red line” by his party.<br/><br/>He stressed that PJD will not “allow its members to break the law.”<br/><br/>Othmani pointed out that PJD welcomes competent members, indicating that the party looks for experts and experienced people who are willing to sacrifice for the greater good of the country.<br/><br/>He welcomed anyone willing to cooperate regardless of their partisan affiliations.</p>
