      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:53:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/Kyle%20Eustice" target="_blank">Kyle Eustice</a></address>
      <p>Calabasas, CA – Doctors are reportedly scrambling to figure out what has sidelined French Montana in a San Fernando Valley hospital. According to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/25/french-montana-icu-medical-emergency/">TMZ,</a> medical personnel still haven’t pinpointed a reason for French’s stomach pain, nausea and elevated heart rate.</p>
      <p>The Los Angeles-based rapper was rushed to the hospital by ambulance last Thursday (November 21) after police investigating an alleged robbery at his Calabasas home noticed he wasn’t acting right.</p>
      <p>On Monday morning (November 25), French shared a video clip to his Twitter account, capturing his surroundings.</p>
      <p>“6 days in icu,” he wrote.</p>

      <p>The philanthropic artist has been traveling extensively throughout Europe and the Middle East as an ambassador of “I Stand With Immigrants.” Some of his associates suspect <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.52919/title.french-montana-announces-montana-album">French</a> could have food poisoning.</p>
      <p>The robbery at his home turned out to be a false alarm.</p>
