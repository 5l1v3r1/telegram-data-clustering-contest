      <h1>China's Saudi crude imports rise 76% in October on increasing demand</h1>

      <p>BEIJING — China’s crude oil imports from</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia rose 76.3% in October, boosted by demand from new</p>
      <p>refiners, with the kingdom retaining its position as the top</p>
      <p>supplier to the world’s biggest oil importer.</p>
      <p>Saudi shipments grew to 8.41 million tonnes, or 1.98 million</p>
      <p>barrels per day (bpd), compared with 1.74 million bpd in</p>
      <p>September and 1.12 million bpd in same period last year, data</p>
      <p>from the General Administration of Customs showed on Monday.</p>
      <p>Two new integrated independent refineries, Hengli</p>
      <p>Petrochemical Co in the north and Zhejiang</p>
      <p>Petrochemical in the south, have supported crude arrivals from</p>
      <p>Saudi.</p>
      <p>The impact of a drone and missile attack on Saudi</p>
      <p>oil-processing plants on Sept. 14 did not limit October oil</p>
      <p>flows, as Saudi Aramco drew on inventories to maintain supplies</p>
      <p>to customers.</p>
      <p>Analysts from the Refinitiv Oil Research team expect the</p>
      <p>supply disruption in Saudi may start to show in cargo arrivals</p>
      <p>in November.</p>
      <p>Chinese customs did not give a number for Venezuelan crude</p>
      <p>imports but analysts expect the figure to have fallen to zero</p>
      <p>last month as buyers stopped taking oil from the South American</p>
      <p>exporter amid sanctions imposed by the United States.</p>
      <p>Imports from Iran remained stable at 532,790 tonnes in</p>
      <p>October, just below 538,878 tonnes in September, despite</p>
      <p>persistent tensions between Washington and Tehran.</p>
      <p>China’s Malaysian crude imports in October doubled from the</p>
      <p>last year’s level, reaching 1.95 million tonnes.</p>
      <p>Shipments from Malaysia, such as Mal blend and Singma blend,</p>
      <p>are typically a mixture of Venezuelan, Iranian and other grades,</p>
      <p>according to Emma Li, senior oil analyst with Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>“Direct imports from Venezuela have been cut to zero but</p>
      <p>(demand for) Mal blend remains strong, which is reflected in the</p>
      <p>Malaysia number,” said Li.</p>
      <p>The Refinitiv research team also expects Malaysian arrivals</p>
      <p>to reach a record as a result of U.S. sanctions on exports of</p>
      <p>Iranian and Venezuelan crude.</p>
      <p>Imports of U.S. crude in October reached 908,422 tonnes, up</p>
      <p>from 517,982 tonnes in September.</p>
      <p>Arrivals of Russian crude rose to 6.97 million tonnes from</p>
      <p>6.31 million tonnes in previous month.</p>
