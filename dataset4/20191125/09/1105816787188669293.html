      <h1>I ignore my phone for at least 20 minutes after I wake up: Dia Mirza</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:49:57+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>Actor, producer and UN goodwill ambassador, Dia Mirza, 38, dons many hats with ease. But naturally, being so busy with so many things at the same time can be troublesome and take its toll on one’s health.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, Mirza knows just how to keep her health in check. The <i>Sanju</i> star has written a note talking about what fitness means to her and how she makes sure to look after herself.</p>

      <p>“Fitness, to me, means a healthy mind and body for which I follow a nutrition-based diet and commit to regular workouts,” begins the former Miss Asia Pacific. “The body needs enough nutrients to function well so I start my day with almonds and eat a gluten-free vegan diet. I avoid packaged and oily foods but eat something light every two hours.”</p>

      <p>In the mornings, Mirza has chia pudding with almond milk, mixed seeds, blueberries and pomegranate. “My lunch is gluten-free <i>rotis</i>, a big bowl of <i>daal</i>, veggies, salad and a little rice. Dinner is soup and leafy salads, sprouts and avocado — I have avocado and chia daily because they’re just so good for the body!” <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/fitness/my-fitness-motto-is-10k-steps-a-day-no-matter-what-says-actor-dia-mirza/story-VRdnZqEUNSlckdmj2tainM.html"><i>Hindustan Times</i></a> quoted her as saying.</p>
      <p>According to the Bollywood beauty, organic foods are easier to digest so she tries to stick to fresh, local and seasonal produce. “I used to play a lot of sports as a student. I’d go swimming, horse-riding, play <i>kabaddi</i>. I still love to swim, play basketball and generally keep active,” Mirza added.</p>

      <p>“My workouts are a mix of stretching, cross-fit and weight training, Pilates, yoga and kickboxing. I do them at least six times a week, no matter where I am. My go-to exercises are yoga, stretches and some freehand stuff like squats, lunges, surya namaskar and dhanur asanas, which keep the body supple and flexible. Oh and I do 10,000 steps a day, every day, no matter what!”</p>
      <p>When asked about stress, Mirza explained that she “reacts to situations” only. “That way, the situation is handled and doesn’t get stressful. From a personal perspective, I manage stress by meditating every morning. It simply calms the mind. I find walks very relaxing too. I’m a nature lover, so being amid greenery, walking amid trees, simply rejuvenates me. I ignore my phone for at least 20 minutes after I wake up!”</p>
