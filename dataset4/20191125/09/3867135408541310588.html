      <h1>Land Rover Range Rover Evoque SUV is comfortable, extravagant</h1>
      <h2>The luxury compact has a roomier interior, more technology, and an advanced Terrain Response system.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.heraldnet.com/author/mary-lowry/" target="_blank">Mary Lowry</a></address>
      <p>Land Rover’s Range Rover Evoque compact luxury SUV is moderately redesigned for 2020, its first cosmetic touch-up since being introduced in 2012. At the same time, a mild-hybrid powertrain joins the lineup, there are new driver assistance features, and off-road technologies have been advanced.</p>
      <p>The 2020 Range Rover Evoque is available in six versions: S, SE, First Edition, R-Dynamic S, R-Dynamic SE, and R-Dynamic HSE. The first three are powered by a turbocharged 246-horsepower four-cylinder engine, and the last three have the mild-hybrid setup (MHEV) generating 296 horsepower. All models have a nine-speed automatic transmission.</p>
      <p>Pricing starts at $43,645 for the S model including a $995 destination charge.</p>
      <p>Fuel economy ratings for the turbo engine are 20 mpg city, 27 mpg highway, and 23 mpg combined. Numbers for the MHEV are 21/26/23 mpg.</p>
      <p>Among the exterior design changes are door handles that are flush with the Evoque’s body when the vehicle is locked or moving, but automatically protrude when it’s unlocked.</p>
      <p>The new Evoque is about the same size as the previous version, but improves on interior space. There’s more knee room for rear seat passengers, the 21.54 cubic-feet rear cargo area is a 6-percent increase over last year, and the glove box and center console are enlarged for friendlier stowage of small items. With second row seats folded, cargo capacity is 50.5 cubic feet.</p>

      <p>As part of an optional 360 surround camera system, a feature Range Rover calls ClearSight Ground View gives drivers a view under the front of the Evoque, and an optional rear view mirror with ClearSight nomenclature provides rear view visibility even when rear seat passengers or cargo would otherwise be blocking it.</p>
      <p>Android Auto and Apple CarPlay capability are added, and a 4G WiFi hotspot is available.</p>
      <p>On the all-terrain ability front, which is Range Rover’s long-standing specialty, Terrain Response 2 technology is offered for the first time on the Evoque. It incorporates an automatic mode for the terrain response settings.</p>
      <p>My tester was the R-Dynamic HSE model. All the aforementioned features (and then some) are standard on this model, along with every comfort and convenience feature most people could think of. Extreme extravagance was provided by $10,400 worth of options including 21-inch wheels instead of 20-inchers, and a Meridian surround sound audio system rather than the plain old 380-watt Meridian sound system.</p>
      <p>The MHEV powertrain delivers satisfying acceleration and the 2020 Evoque’s ride and handling on highways and tightly twisted roads is commendable. The cabin is like a compact executive suite.</p>
      <p>There’s a tiny issue with the automatic start/stop system. Let’s just say it’s not inconspicuous. It can be disabled with the push of a button, but I left it on because the occasional mild shudders reminded me that some fuel was being saved.</p>
      <p>One more thing, a literal heads-up to any tall or even medium person entering or exiting the Evoque’s second row seats: That lovely sloping roof giving Evoque its exotic signature look requires that you duck to avoid head-butting it.</p>
