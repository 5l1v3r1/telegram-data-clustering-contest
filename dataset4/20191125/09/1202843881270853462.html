      <p>In a bid to support and promote national products in local markets, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has issued mandatory terms for the use of the national product logo on Qatari goods.</p>
      <p>The mandatory terms compel all local manufacturers and producers to place the national product label on all agricultural products as well as all locally-manufactured and semi-manufactured goods that are sold in Qatar. </p>
      <p>Through this new initiative, the Ministry aims to support and promote national products across local market and to enable investors to easily reach consumers as well as to provide traders and investors seeking to offer new products access to new markets.</p>
      <p>The mandatory terms stipulate that all manufacturers and producers, as well as sales outlets who have obtained the necessary approvals and official licences, are allowed to use the logo. The logo can be used on all locally manufactured and semi-manufactured products.</p>
      <p>The logo shall appear on the front cover of the product’s packaging or on any other place that is clearly visible to the consumer, taking into consideration not to place the label under the product.</p>
      <p>According to the ministry, logo stickers can be placed on shipping and distribution vehicles and must be designed to be proportional to the vehicle’s size. The logo can be placed on advertising materials for marketing purposes. </p>
      <p>It is prohibited to use the logo on products intended for export. </p>
      <p>The slogan or phrase “Made in Qatar” may be used in such a case. Adherence to the design guidelines is required while changing the shape or content of the logo is prohibited, said the Ministry.</p>
