      <p>Way back in April, the young Derry, Northern Ireland native Bridie Monds-Watson released <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2028186/soak-knock-me-off-my-feet-grim-town/video/"><i>Grim Town</i></a>, her second album as SOAK. Beyond her own tunes, she’s delivered some intriguing covers this year including the 1975’s “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2040532/soak-country-air-love-it-if-we-made-it-the-1975-cover/music/">Love It If We Made It</a>” and Sleater-Kinney’s “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2050393/soak-sleater-kinney-cover-modern-girl/music/">Modern Girl</a>.” And today she’s taken on another modern indie classic, the National’s “Bloodbuzz Ohio,” which recently appeared on our list of <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/featured/best-songs-of-the-2010s-list/">the decade’s best songs</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite deeply personal lyrics that reference Matt Berninger’s own roots in Ohio, the song translates well to a foreigner’s care. Monds-Watson has reduced “Bloodbuzz Ohio” to mostly just breathy voice and loosely strummed guitar with a brief and effective keyboard interlude. She sounds great singing “I still owe money to the money to the money I owe,” bringing out a bright, tuneful quality that gets lost in the original song’s swirl of noise and the depth of Berninger’s baritone.</p>
      <p>Basically she’s turned it from one kind of prestige TV sync music into another, a notion that aligns quite well with her quote from the press release: “There’s something so special about the imagery the National manages to create within their music and I often catch myself imagining each song as its own movie trailer. I love the manic world this song creates.”</p>
      <p>Listen below — and if you’re in the mood for <i>even more</i> SOAK covers, back when she was a precocious teen she delivered takes on <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1673578/soak-the-mother-we-share-chvrches-cover/mp3s/">Chvrches</a>, <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1798173/soak-digital-witness-st-vincent-cover/mp3s/">St. Vincent</a>, and <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1803479/soak-immigrant-song-led-zeppelin-cover/mp3s/">Led Zeppelin</a> too.</p>
