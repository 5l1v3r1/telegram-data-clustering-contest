      <p>LAKE STEVENS — For months, those who live around this lakeside town have expressed frustration, concern and excitement about a Costco potentially moving to Lake Stevens.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, they’ll be able to talk directly to the Lake Stevens City Council as it <a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/news/lake-stevens-city-council-to-discuss-costco-later-this-month/">considers a development agreement</a> the company has applied for. The council could make a decision at that time, but it doesn’t have to.</p>
      <p>If everything moves forward, the company’s next steps would be to ask for approval of a construction plan and then to apply for building permits.</p>
      <p>Some who plan to attend have asked that the meeting be moved to a different day.</p>
      <p>“Many of us felt that date, just two days before the Thanksgiving holiday, was simply an attempt to limit the number of people who would show up to testify,” wrote Lake Stevens resident Carol McDonald in a letter to The Daily Herald editors.</p>
      <p>Others, such as resident David Clay, are worried the store would create light pollution, harm the environment and increase traffic and noise in the area, he said in a letter to the city.</p>
      <p>Clay lives in unincorporated Snohomish County near the potential Costco site. As proposed, the 16,000-square-foot store would be at the southwest corner of Highway 9 and 20th Street Southeast, near South Lake Stevens Road.</p>
      <p>Those in favor of a potential Costco say the new store would create jobs and bring in tax revenue for city projects.</p>
      <p>Some have expressed concern about the real estate agent selling the property.</p>

      <p>Near the site, a property management sign bears the name of Marcus Tageant from Task Properties. Tageant is also on the Lake Stevens City Council.</p>
      <p>He said he could not confirm or deny his position as the property’s broker because of nondisclosure agreements but has left the room whenever the council has talked about Costco.</p>
      <p>“If it’s on the docket, I don’t even show up for that meeting,” he said.</p>
      <p>As of Friday afternoon, Tageant wasn’t sure if he would be at the Tuesday night meeting. He may attend part of the meeting and leave when Costco comes up, he said.</p>
      <p>The Issaquah-based company has proposed to build a warehouse store and a 30-pump gas station, along with more than 800 parking spots. The development would cover about 37 acres.</p>
      <p>New roads also are expected to be built that would connect 20th Street Southeast and Highway 9.</p>
      <p>Other nearby Costco stores are in Smokey Point, Everett and Lynnwood.</p>
      <p>In Lake Stevens, Costco first applied for a design and site plan review <a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/business/costco-moves-closer-to-a-potential-store-in-lake-stevens/">about six months ago</a> and soon after visited the city for a <a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/news/meeting-about-proposed-costco-draws-more-than-100-people/">public meeting</a>.</p>
      <p>The development agreement is the first time the city council will have the chance to vote on a Costco application. The meeting is 7 p.m. Tuesday at the Lake Stevens School District Educational Service Center, 1309 22nd St. NE.</p>
