      <p>Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is officially launching his plan to "fix" the internet. From a report:<i> The World Wide Web Foundation, a non-profit campaign group set up by Berners-Lee, has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/25/tim-berners-lee-launches-contract-for-the-web-to-fix-the-internet.html">secured the backing of tech giants Facebook, Google and Microsoft for the scheme, dubbed the "contract for the web."</a> The British computer scientist first outlined his vision to overhaul organizations' <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/18/09/30/1122238/tim-berners-lee-announces-solid-an-open-source-project-which-would-aim-to-decentralize-the-web">approach to the internet at the Web Summit event last year</a>. At the time, he said the web was "at a tipping point." The contract calls on companies to respect consumers' data privacy and urges governments to ensure everyone has access to the internet. "Never before has the web's power for good been more under threat," Adrian Lovett, CEO of the World Wide Web Foundation, told CNBC in an interview Friday. He added that the rise of hateful content and fake news being propagated online meant something had to change. "We're launching the <a href="https://contractfortheweb.org/">contract for the web</a> for the world's first-ever global action plan to protect the web as a force for good, bringing together companies, governments and citizens from around the world to say these are the things that need to be done to put things back on the right track."<br/><br/>Other organizations backing the contract include DuckDuckGo, Reddit, GitHub and Reporters Without Borders. One major component of the pledge is the requirement that the web remains an accessible tool for all users. Lovett said that, "despite the progress we've seen in getting the world connected, half the world doesn't have access." He said the contract comes with nine core principles, while underneath them is a total of 76 clauses. "Not every organization has to abide by all of them," he insisted. "A good number of those 76 will be relevant." Berners-Lee will deliver a speech in Berlin, Germany, on Monday where he is due to say the contract will serve as a blueprint for governments, companies and citizens to safeguard the web as a force for good. The World Wide Web Foundation says it is working with partners to develop tools that can measure progress on the contract's various clauses.</i></p>
