      <p>SEATTLE — Evan White earned a $24 million, six-year contract from Seattle Mariners before playing a game above Double-A.</p>
      <p>Seattle announced the contract Monday after the first baseman completed a physical. The agreement includes options for 2026-28 and likely will cover all the years White would be eligible for salary arbitration.</p>
      <p>“I believe in the organization and where we’re going and it’s something I want to be a part of,” White said.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old was the 17th overall pick in the 2017 amateur draft out of Kentucky.</p>
      <p>From the time he joined the Mariners’ system he’s been regarded as the club’s first baseman of the future because of his excellent defense and a solid bat at the plate.</p>
      <p>White briefly played for the Everett AquaSox in 2017.</p>
      <p>“For us to be able to do this with a player who has yet to play in the big leagues but we have become so comfortable with, not just with what we believe his upside as a player to be, but who he is as a person, I think all of that has gone into making this a very easy thing for us organizationally,” Seattle general manager Jerry Dipoto said.</p>
      <p>Philadelphia infielder Scott Kingery ($24 million for six years) and Chicago White Sox outfielder Eloy Jiménez ($43 million for six years) agreed in March to lucrative contracts before their big-league debuts, but both had played at Triple-A.</p>
      <p>It’s the largest contract for an American player who has not played above Double-A, and Seattle added White to its 40-man roster in order to sign him to a big league deal.</p>
      <p>White said the first conversations started a little over a week ago.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t take this lightly. It’s something took a lot of time thinking about and I think this is the best thing for us,” White said.</p>
      <p>Seattle envisions White as a major part of its future core, along with fellow top prospects Jarred Kelenic, Kyle Lewis, Logan Gilbert, Justin Dunn and Justus Sheffield.</p>
      <p>White is the only player in the organization currently under contract beyond the 2021 season.</p>
      <p>Both Kyle Seager and Yusei Kikuchi have options beyond 2021 but neither is locked in like White.</p>
      <p>White should have a chance to earn the starting job at first base — the Mariners used eight players there last year.</p>
      <p>Austin Nola and Daniel Vogelbach had the most games at first, but Seattle thinks White is a better defender.</p>
      <p>While White’s defense has been highly regarded, his bat isn’t bad, either.</p>
      <p>He hit .293 with 18 homers and 55 RBI at Double-A Arkansas last season. White has hit .296 with an .832 OPS in parts of three seasons in the minors.</p>
      <p>Seattle acquires lefty from Yanks</p>
      <p>Nestor Cortes Jr. has been traded from the New York Yankees to Seattle for $28,300 in international signing bonus pool allocation, the remainder of what the Mariners had available to deal.</p>
      <p>A left-hander who turns 25 on Dec. 10, Cortes was 5-1 with a 5.67 ERA in 32 relief appearances and one start this year after making four relief appearances in his first big league season with the Yankees in 2018.</p>
      <p>He was designated for assignment last week to open a roster spot for prospects protected ahead of the winter meeting draft next month.</p>
      <p>New York’s 2019-20 pool total increased to $5,835,800 with Monday’s trade.</p>
      <p>The Yankees have used $5,762,000 of that, including $5.1 million on Dominican outfielder Jasson Dominguez, $377,500 on Dominican third Enger Castellano and $187,500 on Venezuelan catcher Manuel Palencia.</p>
      <p>Seattle has now spent its entire $5.37 million pool and is limited to signing bonuses of $10,000 or less for the current signing year, which ends June 15.</p>
