        <b>While speaking after their disappointing 3-3 draw in the Premier League against Sheffield United on Sunday, Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer slammed his players and questioned their desire to win matches.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“I was angry, disappointed, you had to wake them up,” the Norwegian said, before adding:</p>
      <p>“You had to do something about it. I could have changed every player at half-time, apart from the keeper.”</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t about tactics. It was about the desire first half, getting first to the ball, tackling, winning challenges. Sometimes tactics go out of the window.”</p>
      <p>“You have to earn the right to win a game and we didn’t have any right to win the game after 70 minutes. We were nowhere near a Manchester United team.”</p>
      <p>And upon asked how worried he was about a perceived lack of hunger among the various Manchester United stars, Solskjaer replied: “It’s not about a lack of desire (per se)… maybe it is that confidence in themselves.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t doubt them wanting to win but sometimes young players don’t know how to win challenges like this. We’ve learned a lot today – I’m sure they have. Release the fear, play with belief and confidence,” he concluded.</p>
