      <h1>Blantyre Soccer Academy boost for Thai Tims</h1>
      <h2>A new outdoor coverway was created thanks for funds raised from Blantyre Soccer Academy.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Leona Greenan, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/leona-greenan/</a></address>
      <p>Work is now complete on a new outdoor coverway at a Thai-based school for children with Down’s syndrome, thanks to ongoing support from Blantyre Soccer Academy.</p>
      <p>The Good Child Foundation school, based in the Chanthaburi province of Thailand, formed a partnership with the soccer academy following the tragic murder of Blantyre teenager Reamonn Gormley in 2011.</p>
      <p>During a gap year from university in 2010, Celtic-mad Reamonn (pictured right) had gone to volunteer with the foundation – whose pupils now also follow Celtic and are affectionately known as the Thai Tims – and won the hearts of everyone there through his work and dedication.</p>
      <p>Every year the football academy donates thousands of pounds to the foundation, raised during their annual Reamonn Gormley Memorial Soccer Festival and Sportsman’s Dinner, held every May and June.</p>
      <p>The donations are then used to improve facilities for the children and staff at the school, with this year’s cash being used to build their new ‘Blantyre Soccer Academy coverway’ complete with educational boards on either side.</p>
      <p>Blantyre Soccer Academy chairman Jimmy Whelan said: “Work is now complete on the new coverway at the Good Child Foundation and we are grateful at being kept regularly up to date on the school’s progress from Paul Lennon.</p>

      <p>“Everyone at BSA from the staff, volunteers, parents and the players should be so proud of their achievements over the years in memory of Reamonn Gormley, and indeed of our charitable donations which sometimes go unnoticed. Well done all.”</p>
      <p>Paul Lennon, who set up the Good Child Foundation with his wife Pun, said: “Many thanks to Jimmy Whelan, all at BSA and to everyone who supports the annual Reamonn Gormley Memorial Soccer Festival. The coverway is a fantastic addition to the school and it’s going to be great for the kids, so many thanks.”</p>
      <p>Previous years have seen the foundation build a purpose-built Blantyre Soccer Academy art room in memory of Reamonn, new computers and software for their IT suite, a spectators’ stand that lets the children watch sports in comfort, as well as money to send the children on a three-day trip-of-a-lifetime to a theme park in Thailand, along with help in various other educational projects.</p>
      <p>A former pupil of John Ogilvie High, Reamonn was just 19-years-old when he was stabbed to death in an attempted street robbery while walking home from the Parkville Hotel, on February 1, 2011.</p>
