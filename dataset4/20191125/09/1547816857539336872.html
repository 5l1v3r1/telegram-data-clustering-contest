        <b>Belly fat is the greatest nightmare one can ever have. But, our Hollywood divas know how to fight with the stubborn fat. On Hollywood's Hot Meter, it is time to ogle at Kendall Jenner, Halle Berry and Jennifer Lopez's well-toned abdomen.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Abs are hard to get, but voila, here are our Hollywood divas flaunting the sexiest bellies we have seen. We are talking about Halle Berry, Jennifer Lopez and Kendall Jenner who put in a great amount of effort to keep in shape. So much that they even have abs and we like how they show off on social media. When it comes to K-clan, it is given that the ladies will take good care of themselves and do everything under the sun to stay in shape, but we are mighty impressed with Jennifer Lopez and Halle Berry who are so dedicated when it comes to their workout routines that they have mastered the skill to have perfect bodies.</p>
      <p>Starting with Halle Berry, it was just a few days ago that she posted a picture on Instagram showing off her sexy abs. She observed that day as #FitnessFriday and wrote a long post on how good it feels to be fit. She wrote, "here’s no better feeling than setting a goal and smashing it. One of my goals for #BruisedTheMovie? Ripped Abs - and today? I finally got them, and it feels unbelievable! This #FitnessFriday, I encourage you guys to set your bar. What is your fitness goal? Set the BAR higher than you think, share your goal in the comments and HOLD yourself to it."</p>

      <p>Next, we have Jennifer Lopez who has been very diligent with her workout regime. Not much long ago, JLo had posted a picture from the gym showing off her well-toned abs.  Even when sweating, JLo looked so HOT! 'SoLful Sunday’s...', she wrote.</p>
