      <h1>David Moyes in line for Everton return?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/david-moyes/"><b>David Moyes</b></a> has reportedly emerged as the favourite to replace <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marco-silva/"><b>Marco Silva</b></a> as <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/everton/"><b>Everton</b></a> manager.</h2>

      <p>After Saturday's 2-0 home defeat to Norwich City, the Toffees sit in 15th position in the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">Premier League standings</a>, which has led to calls for Silva to be removed from his position in the dugout.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Mirror</i>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/farhad-moshiri/"><b>Farhad Moshiri</b></a> is keen to show 'loyalty' towards the Portuguese, who has been given significant funds in his three transfer windows at Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>However, the report says that it is increasingly inevitable that Everton and Silva will part company, with Moyes lined up to for a return to the club.</p>
      <p>The Scot enjoyed a successful stint on Merseyside between 2002 and 2013, which ultimately led to him being selected as the replacement for Sir <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alex-ferguson/"><b>Alex Ferguson</b></a> at Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Moyes, who has been out of work since leaving West Ham United in 2018, may potentially be handed a deal until the end of the campaign.</p>
