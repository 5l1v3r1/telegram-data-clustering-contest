      <p>Glen Whittaker, 26, of Baker Close, Ludlow, appeared in Shrewsbury Crown Court on Thursday to be sentenced for a range of driving offences.</p>
      <p>On June 29 at Telford Magistrates Court, he pleaded guilty to drink driving, dangerous driving and driving without insurance.</p>
      <p>Mr Geoffrey Dann, prosecuting, said the incident which took place on June 5, saw Whittaker reach speeds of 105mph, veer on the wrong side of the road and ignore a red light.</p>
      <p>“Eventually he turned into a field entrance and ran off towards woodland down a farm track,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The defendant was struggling with police officers trying to get away and had to be restrained.</p>
      <p>“He was arrested and taken to the police station where he provided a positive sample of breath. He was interviewed and the explanation he gave was that he had been to the pub with a friend and was travelling down to Ludlow. At some point they swapped over because there was concern about the friend being over the limit.</p>
      <p>“He panicked when seeing the police and feared he was over the limit and was not insured on the car.”</p>
      <p>Whittaker, who defended himself, apologised for his actions and told the court that it was a “foolish mistake”.</p>
      <p>He added: “I can’t apologise enough for what I have done. I accept everything that’s coming my way. There is no excuse for my actions. It could have proved tragic for others.”</p>
      <p>Whittaker was sentenced to 12 months suspended for 18 months, disqualified from driving for two years, handed a 12 month community order and must adhere to a 10 week curfew from 7pm to 6am.</p>
      <p>Recorder Mr Benjamin Nicholls said: “This was quite an appalling episode of dangerous driving.”</p>
