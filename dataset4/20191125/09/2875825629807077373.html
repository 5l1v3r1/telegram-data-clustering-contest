      <h1>Holly Willoughby embroiled in boob bust-up as she denies enhancing cleavage</h1>
      <h2>This Morning's Holly Willoughby has denied using a bust enhancing body tape to lift her famous boobs after the manufacturers boasted the host was a fan</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:26:39+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:26</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/holly-willoughby">Holly Willoughby</a> has hit back at claims that she uses a lift and shape body tape to enhance her famous cleavage.</p>
      <p>The makers and designers of Perky Pear body tape claimed that the This Morning presenter was a customer, but Holly's rep has said the blonde has "never heard" and "never used" the product.</p>
      <p>Twins Samantha and Charlotte Ryder shared with <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/">The Daily Star</a> that mother-of-three Holly uses their breast-enhancing invention - that costs £12.99.</p>
      <p>"Holly Willoughby is a customer, she messaged us saying how much she loves it," they boasted.</p>

      <p>In response, a spokesperson for Holly, who has earned the nickname Holly Willoughbooby for her enviable assets, responded: “She has never heard of it. She has never used the tape herself , not has she messaged the manufacturers.</p>
      <p>"Holly does work with a number of stylists and it is possible that they know something about it. But as far as she is concerned she has never worn it.”</p>

      <p>The siblings - who created the confidence-boosting tape after Samantha used her grandma's physiotherapy tape to hold her own bust in place under revealing ensembles - have also told that Geordie Shore's Vicky Pattison is a user.</p>
      <p>Proud to promote the brand, Vicky's agent confirmed to the publication that the curvy star is a big fan of the stick-on bra.</p>
      <p>Other celeb clients who have posted social media posts with the product include Love Island's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen</a> , TOWIE's Amber Turner and MTV's Marnie Simpson.</p>

      <p>Holly's denial comes after I'm A Celeb fans called for her to return to hosting duties on the jungle show - after she stood in for Ant McPartlin on last years series after he was forced to pull out following his drink-drive shame earlier on in 2018.</p>
      <p>As the show returned earlier this month, fans took to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to share their thoughts on missing Holly.</p>
      <p>"Anyone missing Holly &amp; Dec presenting #ImACeleb," a team Holly devotee said.</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "I'll be honest....am quite missing Holly."</p>

      <p>Others contributed: "I thought I’d miss Holly but there’s actually nothing better than Ant &amp; Dec."</p>
      <p>Another agreed: "So lovely to see Ant back on I’m a Celeb, Holly was fab but it just wasn’t the same."</p>
