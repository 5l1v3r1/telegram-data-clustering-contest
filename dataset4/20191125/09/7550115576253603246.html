        <b>Liverpool’s loanees suffered an international break hangover, with productivity limited despite all ten available Reds featuring.</b>
      </p>
      <p>While the borrowed Reds all enjoyed game time upon the domestic football restart, there was precious little output in terms of goals and assists.</p>
      <p>Form and performance level among the loanees suffered, with regular star performers throughout the season so far all experiencing quiet returning displays.</p>
      <p>Arguably the only man who didn’t endure a drop off was <b><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/loris-karius/">Loris Karius</a></b>.</p>

      <p>The German has been in much-improved form recently at Besiktas, and he continued the upturn by keeping a second successive clean sheet in a 1-0 win against Konyaspor.</p>
      <p>The shut-out was Karius’ fifth in six Super Lig games – a fine run which has been key to helping his side recover from a poor start to rise to fifth place with five wins from those six matches.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, that was about as good as it got, as the pause disrupted the rhythm of certain in-form loaned Reds.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/harry-wilson/">Harry Wilson</a></b> was one of those, unable to build on his goal-scoring display against Newcastle two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>The Welshman endured a frustrating afternoon in <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>’s 2-1 loss to Wolves, as he played only 45 minutes of the defeat.</p>
      <p>Wilson’s side went down to 10 men in the first-half – Simon Francis seeing red – and that meant he was sacrificed in Eddie Howe’s half-time tactical reshuffle.</p>
      <p>It ruined what should have been an interesting afternoon which originally saw Wilson deployed in a new role as a ‘double-10’ with Ryan Fraser in support of Callum Wilson.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/ovie-ejaria/">Ovie Ejaria</a></b> has been in top form for a consistent period at Reading, and like Wilson, registered on the scoresheet with a fine finish before the interruption.</p>

      <p>But he too had a flat return to domestic action, unable to make his mark as the Royals went down 1-0 at Brentford.</p>
      <p>Staying in the Championship, <b><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/tag/kamil-grabara/">Kamil Grabara</a></b> was unable to claim his fourth clean sheet of the season as Huddersfield were held to a 1-1 draw against Birmingham.</p>
      <p>The winless form extended into non-league, where <b>Rhys Williams</b> had a tough afternoon as Kidderminster bowed out of the FA Trophy with a 3-0 loss to Curzon Ashton.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, both Reds in Scotland had to settle for substitute appearances.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/sheyi-ojo/">Sheyi Ojo</a></b> featured for the final 20 minutes of Rangers’ 3-1 win at Hamilton, in which former Reds youngster <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/ryan-kent/">Ryan Kent</a> scored a match-winning brace for Steven Gerrard’s side.</p>
      <p><b>Liam Millar</b> wasn’t quite so lucky, with the Canadian striker playing only the last five minutes of Kilmarnock’s 3-0 victory against Hearts.</p>
      <p>The theme of late sub outings also spread abroad and specifically to Germany, where <b>Nat Phillips</b> played only the final moments of Stuttgart’s 3-0 win against Karlsruher in 2.Bundesliga.</p>

      <p>However, after surprisingly dropping to the bench last time out, <b><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/marko-grujic/">Marko Grujic</a></b> was recalled to Hertha Berlin’s starting XI to face Augsburg.</p>
      <p>It was a miserable comeback for the Serbian though, with Hertha soundly beaten 4-0 while having to play for over an hour with 10 men after goalkeeper Rune Jarstein was sent off.</p>
      <p>One final positive came with fellow Bundesliga loanee, <b>Taiwo Awoniyi</b>, who enjoyed his first minutes since mid-October at Mainz 05.</p>
      <p>Only 15 of them, as his side attempted to see out a 3-1 lead over Hoffenheim, but the Nigerian used them to make a positive impact as his side added two late goals for a stunning 5-1 rout.</p>
