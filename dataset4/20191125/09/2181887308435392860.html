      <h1>Tim Berners-Lee slams Tories over 'Factcheck UK' Twitter stunt</h1>
      <h2>The big boss has spoken and the answer is 'no'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:57:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theinquirer.net/author/profile/2960/chris-merriman" target="_blank">Chris Merriman</a></address>
      <p><b>HEAD OF INTERNET</b> Tim Berners-Lee has lashed out at the UK Conservative Party after a recent stunt.</p>
      <p>The Worldwide Web creator told <i><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50539795">the BBC</a></i> that the decision to rebrand its CCHQ Twitter page as "<a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3084076/cchq-twitter-rebrand-backlash">Factcheck UK</a>", a supposedly independent fact-checking organisation, was "brazen" and an "impersonation".</p>
      <p>The widely-criticised move was compounded by the fact that it took place during the recent head-to-head debate between prime minister Boris Johnson and leader of the opposition Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <p>"It was unbelievable they would do that," said Berners-Lee, adding, "Don't do that. Don't trust people who do that."</p>
      <p>"What the Conservative Party has done is obviously a no-no. That's amazingly blatant."</p>
      <p>For its part, the Conservative Party has repeatedly dismissed the criticism, arguing variously that it was blatantly obvious that it was a Tory page (it wasn't - the handle of CCHQ was in tiny letters and assumed you knew that the "C" stood for "Conservative") and that it was simply offering people a service that fact-checked Jeremy Corbyn and there was nothing wrong was that (there is - it was blatantly trying to deceive the electorate).</p>
      <p>Berners-Lee also called for Facebook to follow in the footsteps of Twitter by banning political advertising: "It's not fair to risk democracy by allowing all these very subtle manipulations with targeted ads which promote completely false ideas. They do it just before the election, and then disappear."</p>
      <p>Berners-Lee identified his targets as part of the launch of "Contract For The Web", a new initiative to try and encourage stakeholders to create a better online environment.</p>
      <p>The contract was written in collaboration with some of tech's biggest players, including Google, Microsoft and that bastion of ethics, Facebook.</p>
      <p>The contract covers areas such as keeping the internet free, restoring net neutrality and the ever-thorny issue of user privacy.</p>
      <p>The hope is that governments will sign up to the contract, but Berners-Lee warned that some major players such as Russia and China are unlikely to join, and the US could be put off by the net neutrality clause.</p>
      <p>Tim Berners-Lee is currently <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3083354/tim-berners-lee-inrupt-gdp5m-investment">working on Inrupt</a> - a decentralised web more akin to his original vision. Sounds like a plot from Silicon Valley if you ask us. μ </p>
