      <p>You can find several sought-after engineering schools that offer a marine engineering degree or a related degree program, but not all engineering schools are created equally.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the best schools for future marine engineers across the globe and some important points to consider when choosing one.</p>
      <h3>What should you consider in a marine engineering school?</h3>
      <p>If you want to pursue a marine engineering degree abroad, it's important to consider several factors. One of the first aspects to look into when you're applying to an engineering program is whether or not it offers the degree you need.</p>
      <p>Typically you'll need to earn a bachelor's degree if you want to become a marine engineer. That's because most marine engineers need to earn an undergraduate degree at the bachelor's level to get a job as a <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/marine-engineers-and-naval-architects.htm#tab-4">marine engineer</a>.</p>
      <p>Moreover, your degree program should offer a degree in marine engineering or a related degree, such as ocean engineering, electrical engineering, or mechanical engineering.</p>

      <p>Even some of the <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/11-of-the-oldest-engineering-schools-in-the-world-that-shaped-the-field">oldest engineering schools around the world </a>that have helped shape the field of engineering offer similar <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/the-best-marine-engineering-schools-in-the-usa">marine engineering</a> degree programs. For instance, TU Braunschweig, The Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Technische Universität Dresden, Technical University of Denmark and the University of Hanover all offer a degree program in mechanical engineering or electrical engineering.</p>
      <p>You'll also want to consider the school’s accreditation. Accreditation matters because it helps employers know that you received a sound education that prepares you to work as a professional in the field.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.abet.org/accreditation/what-is-accreditation/why-abet-accreditation-matters/">ABET</a> accredits engineering schools in the United States and around the world. Schools that pass the ABET’s high standards and achieve accreditation delivers a quality education that prepares students for a career as a marine engineer, so it's worth considering engineering schools that offer ABET-accredited degree programs.</p>
      <p>Marine engineers require a profound technical skillset to take care of several requirements of the job, such as designing and building ships, preparing technical reports and inspecting the machinery. So, it's important to look for a school that offers the degree program that can help you get a job as a marine engineer, such as ABET-accredited schools.</p>

      <p>It's also important to consider the class size and support systems the school has in place. With a smaller class size, you typically can get more opportunities for one-on-one time with your professor. Academic and career support is also crucial in improving your chances for success to complete your degree program and obtain a job as a marine engineer.</p>
      <p>Marine engineers need to have good math and communication skills. So, an academic writing center and advanced math tutoring services for subjects, such as calculus or trigonometry, help support your education as you study your degree abroad.</p>
      <p>It may also be important to consider whether or not the program offers courses in the language you speak or language services to ensure there are little or no language barriers as you pursue your studies.</p>
      <h3>Which top schools offer a marine engineering degree or courses for undergraduates?</h3>
