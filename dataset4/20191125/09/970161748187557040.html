      <p>Kirstie Allsop has rejected Piers Morgan’s offer for a presenting job on Good Morning Britain as he continued to raise doubts about his future on the programme.</p>
      <p>Piers wasted no time in asking whether the Location, Location, Location host wanted a position on the ITV show, with Susanna Reid pointing out that her on-screen partner could be about to leave for good.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a natural progression for me,’ Piers insisted. ‘Glamourous brunette at the top of her game, a big TV star.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘The question really is, Kirstie, if there is a vacancy, God forbid we’d lose Susanna but we’d all move on…’</p>
      <p>Kirstie politely refused the role though, and graciously replied: ‘I would no more seek this job that someone with the patience of a saint does every day.’</p>
      <p>‘Very diplomatic of you,’ Piers remarked.</p>

      <p>Last week, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/piers-morgan-confirms-quit-good-morning-britain-january-ahead-show-extension-11173138/">Piers confirmed that he could quit Good Morning Britain in January ahead of the show’s time extension</a>.</p>
      <p>Piers’s future on the show comes as petitions were formed to get him out of the show over his outspoken views on gender fluidity, often slamming the ideas of the series.</p>
      <p>Susanna has already been courting potential replacements on-air, joking<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/susanna-reid-invites-bill-turnbull-replace-piers-morgan-gmb-4-years-quitting-bbc-breakfast-11049426/"> Bill Turnbull could take over her co-host’s spot</a> after leaving BBC Breakfast.</p>
      <p>The pair even<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/mini-piers-morgan-susanna-reid-steal-hearts-give-og-good-morning-britain-presenters-run-money-11213269/"> auditioned mini Piers and Susanna on today’s show</a> as they continued raising suspicions and searched for potential replacements.</p>
      <p>Susanna has previously joked that ITV ‘can’t afford’ Piers and he then began educating viewers about the importance of knowing their worth.</p>
      <p>‘You have to understand your own value and then you have to stick to it,’ Piers said. ‘I value myself at X You value me at Y therefore, I’m taking my toys out of the pram and going to Z.’</p>
