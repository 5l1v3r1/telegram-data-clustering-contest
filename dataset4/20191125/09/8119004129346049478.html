        <b>A man has died in a so-called shootout with RAB in Dhaka’s Khilkhet.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The incident took place on the bank of a lake, located on the north side of Pink City Bridge, in Swadesh Properties area after 2am on Monday, according to Khilkhet Police Station Inspector (Investigation) Aminul Islam.</p>
      <p>The dead man has been identified as 34-year-old Mizanur Rahman Mintu. He was a drugs and arms trafficker, RAB said.</p>
      <p>Mizanur was implicated in 13 cases, including eight under Drugs Act, two under Arms Act, and one murder, said RAB-1 Acting Company Commander Assistant Superintendent of Police Kamruzzaman.</p>
      <p>A RAB patrol team raided Swadesh Properties area after being tipped of about ‘a group drug dealers’ occupying the area, said Kamruzzaman.</p>
      <p>“When RAB reached the area, the drug dealers opened fire, forcing the elite force to retaliate. A man was shot in the gunfight while the rest fled the scene.”</p>
      <p>Mizanur was subsequently taken to Kurmitola General Hospital where the on-duty doctor declared him dead, Kamruzzaman said.</p>
      <p>A one-shooter gun, two shotguns, 10 cartridges and huge amounts of yaba were recovered from the spot, he added.</p>
