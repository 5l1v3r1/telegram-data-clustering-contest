      <h1>Adelson's Israel Hayom Daily to Pay $14,000 in Gantz Libel Case</h1>
      <h2>The free newspaper did not admit to printing false information, but agreed that future coverage would be 'fair, proper and legal'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:57:16+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:57</time> by <a rel="author">Bini Ashkenazy</a></address>
      <p>The free daily newspaper owned by U.S. billionaire Sheldon Adelson, Israel Hayom, is to pay 50,000 shekels ($14,411) to two charitable causes chosen by Kahol Lavan chairman Benny Gantz to settle a libel suit Gantz had filed earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Under the agreement submitted Sunday to the Tel Aviv Magistrate’s Court, the newspaper does not admit to having printed false information about <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-Benny-Gantz-1.6806259">Gantz</a>, but it will pay 25,000 shekels to the family of Elazar and Rafael Ohana, who were killed Saturday in a Netanya fire, and 25,000 shekels to the Olim Beyahad organization, which helps Jewish Ethiopian immigrants integrate into Israeli society.</p>
      <p>In February Benny Gantz <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/elections/gantz-sues-pro-netanyahu-paper-for-sexual-harassment-reports-1.7000343">filed suit against the paper</a>, claiming it had defamed him in a series of articles regarding allegations made against him by <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/elections/.premium-benny-gantz-sues-woman-who-claims-he-exposed-himself-to-her-when-they-were-schoolmates-for-140-000-1.6979835">Nava Jacobs</a>. Close to the first election in April, Israel Hayom published pieces claiming he had allegedly sexually harassed Jacobs many years ago.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit, filed by attorneys Boaz Ben Tzur, Carmel Ben Tzur and Guy Raveh, argued that Israel Hayom had published a series of tendentious articles and that the newspaper, “Acted with clear journalistic negligence, without making the most basic minimal checks and with clear bad will.”</p>
      <p>Under the compromise, <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-sheldon-adelson-1.5599262">Israel Hayom</a> promised that its reports on Gantz, “Would be fair, proper and legal.”</p>
