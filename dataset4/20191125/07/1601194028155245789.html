      <p>The battle for Jadon Sancho's signature looks set to begin.</p>
      <p>Four high-profile clubs in England and Spain are reportedly monitoring the teenager, one of Europe's brightest prospects.</p>
      <p>Aggrieved with recent events at Borussia Dortmund, Sancho could now seek a new home for next season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>TOP STORY â€“ CLUBS QUEUE UP FOR 'SCAPEGOAT' SANCHO</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Barcelona</b>, <b>Liverpool</b>, <b>Manchester United</b> and <b>Real Madrid</b> are the "leading quartet" of suitors for Borussia Dortmund star <b>Jadon Sancho</b>, according to The Athletic.</p>
      <p>Former club<b> Manchester City</b> have also asked to be "kept informed" following a string of events that have upset the 19-year-old England winger, notably his first-half substitution in the 4-0 Klassiker loss to Bayern Munich earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Sancho's representatives are said to have deemed that move "disgraceful", paving the way for his Dortmund departure at the end of the Bundesliga season.</p>
