      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari has called for a thorough investigation of the gruesome murder of Salome Abuh, the woman leader of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kogi State.</p>
      <p>Concise News had reported that the <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/20/pdp-demands-justice-for-slain-women-leader-in-kogi/">PDP chieftain in Wada Aro, Ochadamu Ward in Ofu Local Government of the state was roasted alive</a> during the governorship election, when political thugs barricaded her house, doused it with petrol and set it ablaze.</p>
      <p>However, in a statement issued on Sunday by his Media Aide, Femi Adesina, President Buahri said the evildoers of the act must be brought to justice irrespective of whatever allegiances they hold.</p>
      <p>President Buhari expressed outrage at the gruesome murder, while also decrying whatever reason could spur anyone to take the life of another human being, particularly a woman.</p>
      <p>He charged all security agencies involved in the investigation to do a thorough and expeditious job on the matter, so that justice could be served without fear or favour.</p>
      <p>The statement read: “We must learn to behave decently, whether during elections or at other times. No life should be taken wantonly under any guise, and the fact that this reprehensible act occurred two days after voting shows primitive behavior, which should not be accepted in a decent society.”</p>
      <p>He also sympathised with the family of the deceased, adding that the treatment visited on the her was pure criminality and bestiality that has gone out of the realm of politics.</p>
