      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a> had a pretty big night at the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/american-music-awards/">American Music Awards</a> on Sunday, as she broke records and stuck it to the man at the same time.</p>
      <p>The man, seemingly, being Scooter Braun, whom Taylor was embroiled in drama with, as well as head of Big Machine Records, Scott Borchetta, after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/taylor-swift-reignites-scooter-braun-feud-encourages-fans-go-manager-claims-blocked-performing-songs-11148397/">she was apparently halted from performing her old tracks</a> at the ceremony.</p>
      <p>Last night she took home six awards, which was a massive middle finger to all the haters, as she, in turn, smashed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/michael-jackson/">Michael Jackson</a>’s record of 24 wins throughout his career at the ceremony, with her total reaching 29.</p>

      <p>The 29-year-old star was honoured with the prestigious artist of the decade and artist of the year accolades, as well as favourite artist – adult contemporary, favourite album – pop/rock for Lover, favourite music video for You Need To Calm Down, and favourite female artist – pop/rock.</p>

      <p>As she picked up her final awards of the night, Taylor reflected on the ‘complicated’ year she’s had, with lots of ups and downs.</p>
      <p>Speaking on stage at Los Angeles’ Microsoft Theatre, she said: ‘The last year of my life has had some of the most amazing times and also some of the hardest things I’ve gone through in my life and not a lot of them are things that haven’t been public.</p>

      <p>‘And I wanted to thank you so much for being the thing that has been a constant in my life.</p>
      <p>‘Like, this industry is really weird. You feel like your stock is either up or down and people either like you or they don’t or you’re feeling bad about yourself. But the people that hang in there for you are the ones that you will never forget.</p>
      <p>‘This year for me has been a lot. It’s been a lot of good, a lot of really complicated. And so on behalf of my family and me, thank you so much for being there and for caring.’</p>

      <p>It wasn’t the only time of the night where she alluded to the drama that had gone down only a week ago, when she claimed she was barred from performing tracks she’d written, after she left her deal with Big Machine and headed to Universal – something Scooter and Big Machine have both denied.</p>

      <p>Taking to the stage for her epic performance to mark the decade she’d spent at the top of the game, she landed in front of crowds in a white shirt with the names of her past albums – the ones she apparently wasn’t allowed to perform.</p>
      <p>Looking almost like prison font, was she throwing shade at being held captive by her former label?</p>
      <p>It certainly seemed that way when she launched into a rendition of The Man, which includes lyrics like ‘I’m so sick of running/As fast as I can/Wondering if I’d get there quicker/If I was a man/I’d be the man’.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t long before she shook it off by performing Shake It Off, ditching the top and bringing back the sparkles.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere at the ceremony, Khalid won three awards, while there were two wins apiece for Billie Eilish, Carrie Underwood and Dan + Shay.</p>
      <p>BTS also scooped three prizes but were unable to attend, but they sent in a recorded message thanking fans for voting for them to win favourite duo or group – pop/rock, tour of the year, and favourite social artist.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>They said: ‘Thank you so much. We are really honored to receive such an important and meaningful award.</p>
      <p>‘BTS has been a group for six and a half years and, throughout those years, we’ve had so many of our dreams somehow manifest into reality and Army, you guys are the ones who make all this possible and we really couldn’t have done it without your love and support from all over the world.</p>
      <p>‘We will try our best to live up to it, to strive high and work hard and return your love back to you.’</p>
