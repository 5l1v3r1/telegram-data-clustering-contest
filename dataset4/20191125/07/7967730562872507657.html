      <h1>Prison time for ministers who fail to declare conflict of interest</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:44:35+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:44</time> by <a rel="author">Lydia Lynch</a></address>
      <p>Queensland government ministers who intentionally fail to declare conflicts of interest will face two years in prison under proposed laws that will be introduced to Parliament this week.</p>
      <p>The law changes were recommended by the state's corruption watchdog after Deputy Premier Jackie Trad’s failure to declare the purchase of a Woolloongabba house by her family's trust.</p>

      <p>At time of the purchase, Ms Trad had ministerial responsibility for the Cross River Rail project. The house lies along the Cross River Rail route.</p>
      <p>Ms Trad failed to declare the purchase on her register of members' interests within the required time frame. She later <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p52x3p.html">sold the house</a> and <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p52orq.html">was stripped of responsibility for the major transport infrastructure project</a>.</p>
      <p>The CCC said it <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p52opu.html">would not proceed with any investigation</a> into the issue, however it made five recommendations to quell future integrity threats, including making it a criminal offence not to declare a conflict of interest that could interfere with ministerial duties.</p>

      <p>It also recommended the Parliament make a criminal offence when a member of cabinet fails to comply with the requirements of the Register of Members’ Interests "if it is found that the member’s lack of compliance was intentional".</p>
      <p>The proposed changes will be brought before the house this week, and debated when Parliament returns in February.</p>
      <p>Controversial plans <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p535cq.html">to cap political donations and campaign spending </a>will also be tabled this week.</p>
      <p>If successful, the spending limit would be in effect for next year’s state election on October 31.</p>
      <p>Donation and spending caps were scrapped by the LNP under Campbell Newman, but have been brought back by the Palaszczuk government.</p>
      <p>It says the laws will ensure “no one can buy an election” while the LNP believes they will give Labor and the unions more spending power.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the government was confident laws would pass to declare the night of Christmas Eve a public holiday, before the Parliament takes a 67-day break until February 4.</p>
      <p>The Palaszczuk government plans to make Christmas Eve a holiday from 6pm until midnight, which could come with a $21.1 million price tag for the taxpayer.</p>
      <p>Ms Palaszczuk said it would mean workers would get properly compensated - receiving penalty rates of up to 250 per cent of normal wages - or enjoy the night off.</p>
