        <b>It’s been an incredibly traumatic few months for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lisa-fowler/">Lisa Fowler</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lucy-benjamin/">Lucy Benjamin</a>), who returned to EastEnders earlier this year to acquire the help of Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite) in getting Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper) and Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters) out of London. When her plan went belly-up, she decided to stay put in Walford — and has found herself embroiled in plenty of drama ever since — but is she about to have a terrifying illness relapse?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Between clashing with Phil (Steve McFadden) over the part she played in harbouring Keanu and Louise, to helping Mel with her plan to get Hunter (Charlie Winter) safely out of the country, it’s been an incredibly stressful time for Lisa. Factor in almost losing her daughter — and grandchild — in the siege, and it’s no wonder she was intent on getting out of Walford.</p>
      <p>Following Hunter’s death, Lisa went out of her way to support Mel, and the pair planned on moving away to Portugal together. However, after Mel discovered Sharon’s (Letitia Dean) secret affair with Keanu, her primary objective became revenge — something which resulted in plenty of conflict between the two best friends.</p>

      <p>After everything that happened with Mel’s revenge scheme, Lisa is no doubt finding life a bit difficult, and — in the coming episodes — Louise quizzes her mum about her medication.</p>

      <p>Later, Keanu informs Sharon that Louise is concerned for her mum, and believes that Lisa might be unwell. As a result, Sharon is left feeling guilty.</p>
      <p>It’s been a tough couple of months for the entire Fowler and Mitchell clan, so the stress of everything has no doubt taken its toll on Lisa.</p>
      <p>The question is: does Louise have reason to be concerned about her mum?</p>
      <p>Has Lisa suffered a relapse?</p>
      <p>Or is she simply determined to expose the truth about everything that’s happened?</p>
