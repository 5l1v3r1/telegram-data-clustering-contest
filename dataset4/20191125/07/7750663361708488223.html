      <h2>F1 looks set to be heading for a three-team battle for the 2020 championship.</h2>

      <p>After <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/max-verstappen/"><b>Max Verstappen</b></a>'s win in Brazil, six-time world champion <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lewis-hamilton/"><b>Lewis Hamilton</b></a> says it is "often the case" that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/red-bull/"><b>Red Bull</b></a> finishes a season strongly.</p>
      <p>But Hamilton says it is clear that Honda is catching up.</p>
      <p>"It's great to see another strong manufacturer," he said. "I hope it means we will have a serious three-way fight next season. It would be good for F1."</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/mercedes/"><b>Mercedes</b></a> driver said it is "inevitable" that young drivers like Verstappen and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/charles-leclerc/"><b>Charles Leclerc</b></a> will challenge the established guard, but he thinks he can still take them on.</p>
      <p>Hamilton's teammate <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/valtteri-bottas/"><b>Valtteri Bottas</b></a> thinks Red Bull-Honda may even have overtaken Mercedes.</p>
      <p>"We knew they would be strong, but I think they have been even better than we expected, especially on the straights," he said.</p>
      <p>1998 and 1999 world champion <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mika-hakkinen/"><b>Mika Hakkinen</b></a> agrees with his countryman Bottas that the Honda may already be giving Verstappen an advantage on the straights.</p>
      <p>"In the thin air in Interlagos the Honda was quicker than the Ferraris and the two Mercedes," he told his Unibet column in Finnish.</p>
      <p>For his part, Verstappen is determined to become the youngest world champion in F1 history, and 2020 will be his last chance to achieve that.</p>
      <p>"I think we've learned a lot lately, so hopefully that's a good sign for next year," he said.</p>
      <p>"Honda have been improving massively so I am very pleased with that."</p>
