      <p>Police in Bali’s Buleleng regency has named a 19-year-old man, identified as Kadek Juli Suardana, a suspect for the alleged rape of a five-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>“I was turned on and that’s why I did it. I lost my mind,” <a href="https://bali.tribunnews.com/2019/11/25/breaking-news-kadek-juli-cabuli-tetangganya-yang-berusia-5-tahun-di-buleleng-pikiran-saya-sesat">Juli said earlier today</a>, as quoted by <i>Tribun-Bali.</i></p>
      <p>According to reports, the five-year-old victim, identified by her initial L, was friends with Juli’s sister and had often come by to play at his house. </p>
      <p>The incident occurred late last month, when Juli caught sight of them taking a shower and proceeded to rape L in the bathroom. </p>
      <p>L, who was injured in her private parts from the incident, then told her parents about what had happened. </p>
      <p>“The victim reported what happened to her parents and [they] reported this to the Buleleng Police,” Dewa Sudiasa from the Buleleng Police said. </p>
      <p>Juli was charged with violating Indonesia’s Child Protection Law, and faces a maximum of 15 years in prison, if convicted. </p>
