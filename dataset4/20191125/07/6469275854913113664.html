      <p>Ms McBlain, 36, died in hospital on Thursday afternoon (November 21) with her family, including her 12-year-old son Reagan, at her bedside.</p>
      <p>She was fatally injured after a Fiat Punto Grande deliberately mounted the pavement in Whalley Banks, at the junction with Pearson Street, at 7.45pm on Tuesday, November 19.</p>
      <p>Dean Qayum, 20, (pictured) remains wanted in connection with Miss McBlaine's death.</p>
      <p>A second pedestrian, a man aged 26 from Blackburn, also sustained serious injuries in the collision.</p>
      <p>The car failed to stop at the scene and was later found abandoned on Lower Hollin Bank Street with significant front end damage.</p>
      <p>Police said attempts had been made to set the vehicle on fire.</p>
      <p>Three people were initially arrested by police on suspicion of murder.</p>
      <p>A 26-year-old man and a second person remain in custody, with a 25-year-old man bailed to December 19.</p>
      <p>Detectives are continuing to appeal for information about Qayum in connection with Miss McBlaine’s death and are warning anyone hiding him will be arrested.</p>
      <p>Qayum is believed to have a leg injury and could be using crutches.</p>

      <p>"I would warn anyone who is protecting him, or helping to hide him, that we will identify this during our investigation and they will also be arrested and prosecuted.</p>
      <p>"My thoughts and those of the team engaged on this inquiry remain with Alison’s loved ones, in particular her 12-year-old son Reagan. I would urge anyone with information about what has happened, or knows where Qayum is, to do the right thing – please come forward and speak to police immediately.</p>
      <p>"I would urge the public to help us find those responsible for this brutal and callous attack."</p>
