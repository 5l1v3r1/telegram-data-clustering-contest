          <p>The Indian selection committee made as many as five changes to the T20I squad which will take on West Indies in three matches at home next month.</p>
          <p>While captain Virat Kohli, all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, spinner Kuldeep Yadav and fast bowlers in Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami have returned to the squad, wicket-keeper batsman Sanju Samson, all-rounder Krunal Pandya, spinner Rahul Chahar and fast bowlers in Khaleel Ahmed and Shardul Thakur have been left out.</p>

Samson, who possesses a heavy fan base on the back of his IPL performances, has received a lot of support from illustrious names with respect to his ouster.</p>
                <p>It is worth mentioning that Samson was included after Kohli was rested for the series against Bangladesh. The 25-year old Kerala and Rajasthan Royals batsman’s name had come up after he registered his <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/sanju-samson-double-century-twitter-lauds-kerala-wicket-keeper-batsman-for-scoring-maiden-list-a-double-hundred/">maiden List A double century</a>, also his maiden List A century after 86 matches.</p>

                      <h3>Harbhajan Singh calls for new selection panel</h3>
                      <p>Veteran spinner Harbhajan Singh was among the many other names who raised concerns post Samson’s ouster. The 39-year old player, who last played for India during Asia Cup in 2016, went on to call for a new selection panel.</p>

                            <p>It is worth mentioning that it isn’t for the first time that the selectors have dropped a player without giving him a go. With Kohli returning to the side, Samson’s exit was always on the cards irrespective of him playing or not.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>Given the stiff competition in the national team in addition to the selection committee focused on giving more chances to wicket-keeper batsman Rishabh Pant, it seems that Samson will have to wait for his opportunity.</p>
                            <p>While Samson has done well in the Indian Premier League, more consistency in the domestic circuit will strengthen his chances of being in contention for playing at the highest level.</p>
