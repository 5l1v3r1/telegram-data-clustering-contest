      <p>Johannesburg - Trophy-holder <b>Mohamed Salah</b> is among 30 nominees named Sunday for the <b>2019 African Player of the Year</b> award.</p>
      <p>He is one of 10 English Premier League stars to make the list, which includes his Liverpool teammates Sadio Mane and Naby Keita.</p>
      <p>There are two each from Arsenal (Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Nicolas Pepe) and Crystal Palace (Jordan Ayew and Wilfried Zaha).</p>
      <p>Riyad Mahrez (Manchester City), Wilfred Ndidi (Leicester City) and Mahmoud 'Trezeguet' Hassan (Aston Villa) complete the contenders from the Premier League.</p>
      <p>A further 12 nominees come from other European leagues - France (three), Belgium, Italy, Netherlands (two each) and Germany, Portugal and Spain (one each).</p>
      <p>Of the other eight contenders for an award introduced in 1970, five play for Asian clubs and three are based in Africa.</p>
      <p>Egyptian Salah is seeking a Player of the Year hat-trick, but may be pipped for first place this time by Senegalese Mane, who is having an outstanding season with Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Mane also helped Senegal reach the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations final, which they lost 1-0 to Algeria in Cairo.</p>
      <p>Other former African Player of the Year winners in contention are Mahrez, who captained Algeria to their first Cup of Nations title since 1990, and Aubameyang.</p>
      <p>Madagascar, who took African by storm when reaching the Cup of Nations quarter-finals last July, are among five challengers for the national team award.</p>
      <p>A surprise nominee for Club Player of the Year is winger Meschak Elia from the Democratic Republic of Congo club Tout Puissant Mazembe.</p>
      <p>He recently received a worldwide one-year ban for falsifying his age while seeking a transfer to Swiss club Young Boys.</p>
