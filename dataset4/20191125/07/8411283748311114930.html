      <h1>GlobalWafers new fab in Korea to mass produce 12-inch wafer in 3Q20</h1>

      <p>GlobalWafers has disclosed it has inaugurated the second plant of its wholly-owned subsidiary MEMC Korea Company (MKC), which is scheduled to start volume production of 12-inch silicon wafers in the third quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>The inauguration ceremony was attended by South Korean president Mun Jae-in and other ranking governments officials, including those from Cheonan, where the plant is located, it said</p>
      <p>The new plant will have a maximum monthly capacity of 176,000 wafers. Volume production was originally set to start in second-quarter 2020, but GlobalWafers has postponed it to the third quarter to allow more time for product validations at clients, industry sources said. As MKC started signing supply contracts with clients since the plant construction began, it has sufficient orders to support its production, the sources indicated.</p>
      <p>MKC's main competitor in South Korea is SK Siltron, now mainly engaged in production of 8- and 12-inch wafers. SK Siltron in September signed an agreement to buy the SiC (silicon carbide) business unit of DuPont Electronics &amp; Imaging.</p>
      <p>GlobalWafers has maintained close cooperation with US-based GTAT for SiC wafers.</p>
      <p>Bolstered by a higher ratio of long-term contracts signed with clients, GlobalWafers has suffered much less than peers from demand slowdown and price falls resulting from the US-China trade war. The company has seen clients gradually enhance their order placement momentum in the fourth quarter of 2019, the sources said.</p>
