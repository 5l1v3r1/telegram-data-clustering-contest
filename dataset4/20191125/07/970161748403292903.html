      <p>The Walking Dead’s midseason finale has landed and it’s one heck of an emotional ride.</p>
      <p>Dante (Juan Javier Cardenas) is left to pick up the pieces after he brutally murdered Siddiq (Avi Nash) in the last episode.</p>
      <p>But while he tries to come up with a plan, Rosita (Christian Serratos) walks in on his killing spree, leaving the secret Whisperer no choice but to try and take her down too.</p>
      <p>However, the new mum finds superhuman strength to defend her baby Coco and ends up winning the fight with the doctor.</p>
      <p>And if that wasn’t enough, as the commotion is going on, Siddiq has risen from the dead as a zombie and is making his way over to the tot for dinner.</p>

      <p>Not realising who the walker is, Rosita rushes over to her bambino and stabs Siddiq through the head before fleeing the scene.</p>

      <p>Alexandria then have to decide what to do with the traitor while still hunting down Alpha’s (Samantha Morton) horde – with Michonne (Danai Gurira) setting off on her own mission.</p>
      <p>There’s a lot to unpack – so let’s waste no more time and get straight into it.</p>
      <h3>Did Gabriel do the right thing in killing Dante?</h3>

      <p>Once Dante was captured by Rosita an her gang, he was quickly taken into the Alexandrian prison for questioning.</p>
      <p>But as the council decided what to do with the murderer, Gabriel (Seth Gilliam) lost it when interrogating the prisoner and ended up stabbing him to death.</p>
      <p>We can’t deny that we’re slightly disappointed he was killed off so soon, but did Gabriel make the right decision?</p>
      <p>Alexandria is already started to fall apart, with Rosita foreshadowing what’s to come by telling Gabriel they’re ‘not as strong as they think’.</p>
      <p>So will there be an uprising following the kill? Or will everyone accept what the priest has done?</p>
      <h3>How will Daryl and Carol escape the horde?</h3>

      <p>As everything was kicking off back at home, Daryl (Norman Reedus) and Carol (Melissa McBride) had set off on their quest to find Alpha’s horde after they were given a tip from Gamma (Thora Birch).</p>
      <p>But as they crossed over into Whisperer territory, Alpha tricked them into a trap seeing them chase her to an underground lair.</p>

      <p>As the duo stumbled into a pit, the camera panned out and all viewers could see was a midst of zombies throwing their arms towards the fan favourites.</p>
      <p>Part of us thinks this is where the showdown between Carol and Alpha will take place, but who will win?</p>
      <p>Alpha knows the tunnels in the cave – but Carol has Daryl on her side – we know who we’ll be placing bets on.</p>
      <h3>Will Michonne return in the second half?</h3>

      <p>It has been confirmed that Danai Gurira will be leaving the zombie epic during season 10, but we still don’t know how or when.</p>
      <p>At the end of the episode, The World Before, Michonne ends up heading out to sea with newcomer Virgil (Kevin Carroll) in hopes of returning with more weapons.</p>
      <p>But before she leaves, she has a heart to heart with Judith (Cailey Fleming) who tells her to go if it means she will help end the war with the Whisperers.</p>
      <p>Michonne then sets sail in a boat from Oceanside with the new character who she has only just met, and we can’t help but think she will not be returning.</p>
      <p>Whether or not we find out how she goes in the second part of season 10 is still unknown, but this story arc would lead nicely into her exit – leaving Judith to fight her battles on her own.</p>
      <h3>Who is the newcomer and is this Maggie’s way to return?</h3>

        <figcaption>Who is the newcomer and can we trust him? (Picture: AMC)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>As Michonne sets off on her adventure with Virgil, we have been left with all the questions as to who he is? Why he’s been introduced so late into the season? What his arrival means? And is he trust worthy?</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The newbie is played by Kevin Carroll and is currently going with the story that he has a family and is just trying to make his way home after looking for supplies.</p>
      <p>But we think he could be playing a game in order to get a boat and flee to a safer island.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year his arrival was announced with him being described as highly intelligent and resourceful man who is desperately trying to get home to his family.</p>
      <p>Could his family be in the community where Maggie is? And will Michonne trade her place with Maggie so she can go home?</p>
      <p>This would mean Danai would have a way of coming back later on in the series.</p>
