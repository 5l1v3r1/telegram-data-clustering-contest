        <b>TV actress Mahhi Vij who welcomed her baby girl, Tara in August 2019, was body shamed post her presence on the ongoing reality show Bigg Boss 13. One of the trolls, addressed her as ‘Moti’ to which the actress had a befitting reply</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s a nasty truth of the society of the woman’s body being trolled in her post pregnancy phase to a certain extend and our celebs too are not spared from this unfortunate body shaming on several instances. TV actress Mahhi Vij who happened to appear on the ongoing TV reality show Bigg Boss 13, was trolled for her post pregnancy body on the Instagram platform. The trolling began when Mahhi shared a picture with her husband Jay Bhanushali, Shefali Jariwala’s husband Parag Tyagi and Asim Riaz’s brother Umar Riaz. </p>
      <p>Being one of the panelists and representing one of the housemates, she was dressed in a maxi dress. The moment she Instagrammed a picture of her, seems like the trollers were just out there to take a jibe at her. Body shaming her troller wrote, “Sharam Kar Moti” to which she blatantly replied, “Was your mother thin after delivering u like IDIOT” Now that’s epic, the actress without losing her cool and getting dirty in her comment, just shut the troller in the best way possible.

      <p>Further giving a piece of mind to this troller, by mentioning how these nasty comments by trollers show their upbringing and represent their mother. When the entire trolling game began, she had slammed the trollers saying, “Don't ask me what kind of a mother I am. I wish I could ask your mother, what kind of a child you are.”</p>
      <p>She also made a point and got to our notice, of these anonymous trolling account having no followers,  but are interestingly following her as well as trolling her. </p>
