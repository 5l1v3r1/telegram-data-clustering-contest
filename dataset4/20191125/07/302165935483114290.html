      <p>SEOUL, Nov 25 — Hairdresser Choi Jong-bum has set his Instagram account from public to private.</p>
      <p>It is understood this is in response to the numerous death threats that he has received following the death of his ex-girlfriend Goo Hara yesterday.</p>
      <p>“This f****** should have died instead. Why is an innocent person dying instead of him? He’s even less than a dog,” read a comment from an angry fan.</p>
      <p>Others labelled him “a coward” and “a blackmailer”.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, #Punish_Choi_Jong_Bum became the top hashtag trend on Twitter in South Korea.</p>
      <p>Last year, the couple became embroiled in a revenge porn case, after a messy break-up, in which each accused the other of assault.</p>
      <p>It is widely blamed for Goo’s attempted suicide in May.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the Instagram account for his hair salon is now also private, with South Korean entertainment sites reporting that the business is closed for the moment as well.</p>
      <p>Choi had previously received backlash for appearing to leverage on the controversy with Goo to promote his business through his social media.</p>
      <p>Last September, Choi contacted news outlets over a video that he claimed would “end (Goo’s) entertainment career”.</p>
      <p>Goo filed a lawsuit in response.</p>
      <p>In August, he was given an 18-month suspended sentence with three years’ probation by a lower court on account of the threat and other forms of criminal behaviour.</p>
      <p>Goo then filed an appeal in September for the Seoul District Court’s initial ruling that found him guilty of assault.</p>
      <p>Choi, whose sentence involved crimes of property damages, physical assault, threats and unnecessary force, was not found guilty of sexual assault in the form of illegal footage filming.</p>
      <p>The case led to intense online rumours and hate comments against Goo.</p>
      <p>The former member of girl group Kara was found dead at her home in Seoul yesterday. She was 28.</p>
      <p>The Seoul Police Department announced today that it has concluded there is no foul play in her death.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, fans had grown increasingly concerned about the state of Goo’s mental health after Sulli — another K-pop star and Goo’s close friend — took her own life following a long struggle with online bullying last month.</p>
