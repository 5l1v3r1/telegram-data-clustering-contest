      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/raw">WWE</a> Survivor Series 2019 was perhaps the most-hyped version of the PPV in recent years. The reason was plain and simple: the inclusion of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">NXT</a>. The addition of NXT meant that the fans would now get to see at least a preview of some potentially great matches in the future.</p>
      <p>At one point during the men’s traditional elimination match, WALTER shared the ring with Drew McIntyre and Braun Strowman.</p>
      <p>There were also moments with Keith Lee lining up against Braun Strowman, making the fans dream about the potential matches that these two could have somewhere down the line.</p>
      <p>Overall, it was a good PPV that delivered some incredible matches but also had some poor moments. In the end, NXT came out as the winners with four wins while SmackDown and RAW ended with two and one wins, respectively.</p>
      <p>In short, it was a show that put NXT over massively with some of their Superstars getting major pushes during the course of the PPV. With that in mind, here are the 4 NXT Superstars who may see a stark rise to their fanbase after Survivor Series:</p>

      <h4>#4 Rhea Ripley</h4>

      <p>As I had predicted in this <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/wwe-survivor-series-2019-5-things-to-expect-tonight-total-decimation-of-former-champion-brutal-match-between-brock-lesnar-rey-mysterio-24-11-2019">article</a>, Rhea Ripley led the women’s NXT team to glory in their elimination match against RAW and SmackDown. Ripley’s week might just be the best among all the NXT Superstars as she not only stood tall at Survivor Series, but also beat Team Baszler at NXT WarGames on Saturday.</p>
      <p>As she pinned Sasha Banks at Survivor Series, it became clear that she is going to one of the biggest Superstars of the company in the near future.</p>
      <p>Her mannerisms, her ability to tell a story inside the squared circle and her move-set - everything about her screams "main event", and after Survivor Series, she will have more voices backing her in the crowd.</p>
      <p>1 / 3 <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/wwe-survivor-series-2019-4-nxt-superstars-who-have-gained-more-fans-due-to-their-performance-at-the-show/2">NEXT</a></p>
