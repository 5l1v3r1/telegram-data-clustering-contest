      <p><b><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/siwon">Siwon</a></b> is facing hate from Chinese netizens.</p>
      <p>On the 24th, he had RT'ed a tweet about <b>Patrick Chow</b>, who was shot by police during the Hong Kong protests. In the interview, Patrick Chow had said, "<i>People can be killed by bullets. But beliefs can't be killed</i>". He has since then un-RT'ed it, but Chinese netizens have been giving him hate on his both Twitter and Instagram accounts. </p>
      <p>However, Siwon did post on his <b>Weibo</b> to explain that he was only showing his interest in Hong Kong and hoping that the chaos and violence would end soon. </p>
