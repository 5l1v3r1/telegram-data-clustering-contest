      <h1>Zimbabwe water crisis needs urgent solution from all stakeholders</h1>

      <p>Section 77 of Zimbabwe's Constitution states that "every person has a right to safe, clean and potable water." Water should be recognized as a great priority. We are living in a water stressed Zimbabwe. It is a global crisis and therefore we must act now! What can we do to save the country and ensure availability of water for all by 2030?<br/><br/>Water is the source of all life. Without it, neither humans nor nature will survive. Yet lack of access to water is a rapidly growing problem and one of the world's gravest risks. It is a global crisis. The water we have at our disposal is often too little, too much or too dirty.<br/><br/>Water scarcity is the lack of fresh water resources to meet water demand. It affects every continent and was listed in 2019 by the World Economic Forum as one of the largest global risks in terms of potential impact over the next decade.<br/><br/>In recent decades, ‘water crisis' and ‘water wars' have become increasing concerns of water professionals, political scientists and the media. Both start with the simplistic and erroneous assumption that the quantity of water available in the world for human use is limited. This, coupled with the fact that population, urbanization and industrial activities are all steadily increasing, is used to predict that the world is facing a water crisis of unprecedented proportion, which may even result in wars between countries over water.<br/><br/>The current water and sanitation situation in Zimbabwe faces many challenges around capacity, behaviors and  the lack of investment in these sectors during and after the economic crisis of the last decade. Access to clean water is a basic right that is important for the survival of humanity yet it can be one of the hardest resources to attain.<br/><br/>The water crisis in all cities has reached alarming levels. Many dams have gone dry while most boreholes are no longer pumping water because the water table is now too low and all hope is now hanging on this rain season. Due to the economic problems, local authorities have also become unable to procure water treatment chemicals to make the little remaining water in some dams potable.<br/><br/>More than half of the 4.5 million residents of Harare's greater metropolitan area now have running water only once a week,  forcing them to wait in lines at communal wells, streams and boreholes.<br/><br/>We need a quick solution on water in all our cities . The shortage of water has lead to open defection . Most people  in the country use the open fields, forests and bushes and bodies of water as convenience is bad enough. What is worse is that even in supposedly Cities like Harare and Bulawayo, it is common to see people defecating in the open. Yet, the cost of this unhealthy living conditions – of not having access to toilets – is expensive  in the urban centres, the issue is pervasive (open defection) at bus terminus .<br/>Many walkways and nearby bushes reek of urine and decaying  human waste  as most avoid to use their toilets because they will be no running water in their taps.<br/><br/>Still about millions Zimbabwe citizens do not have access to safe water supply and  children under the age of five risk to die  from diseases caused by poor access to water, sanitation and hygiene.<br/><br/>All  needed now is that the citizens of Zimbabwe  to understand the values and importance of Water. As a country we need to achieve sustainable solutions in water and sanitation management. Sustainability is about lasting benefits achieved through the continued enjoyment of water supply and sanitation services.<br/><br/>As citizens , what contribution have you done towards sanitation. Water  resources we are seeing today may we see them in the next 250 years. Lets think about water wherever we are today. The water used to be gushing all over but now no longer springs.<br/><br/>Water infrastructure is being vandalized in our own eyes. Play a vital role in a community by being a whistle blower ,discern information to the relevant local government about illegal connections and infrastructure being vandalized .<br/><br/>The Government of Zimbabwe should utilize the money generated in diamonds and all mining fields towards social development aspects and proper planning as the<br/>population is increasing  .<br/><br/>The role of Local Government Authority  must facilitate holistic  3Ps water projects. They need to adopt smart technologies , opening new water services/conservation. The cities fathers should plan for future demand/supply dynamics and new water meter reading technology.<br/><br/>Though the current rainy season has started , weather experts are predicting heavy rains and Zimbabweans hope will mean the dams will fill up once more.<br/><br/>Sustainability of water supply systems is strengthened through the development of a national public-private strategic framework.<br/><br/>Enos Denhere is a Journalist and Social Entrepreneur .
