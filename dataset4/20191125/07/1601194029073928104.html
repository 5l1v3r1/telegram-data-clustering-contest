      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/the-undertaker">The Undertaker</a> was recently interviewed by <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> Hall of Famer Stone Cold Steve Austin for the "Broken Skull Sessions" on the WWE Network.</p>
      <p>In the show, where he talks about several different things, right from his start in WCW to his WWE run as well as the trials and tribulations that he had to face in his WWE career.</p>
      <p>In the interview, he was asked by Stone Cold about which Superstar he went to advice for. The Undertaker revealed that WWE Hall of Famer Jake "The Snake" Roberts, was the legend that he spoke to when 'Taker was a budding Superstar.</p>
      <blockquote>"Jake ‘The Snake’ Roberts, man... brilliant, brilliant mind. Unbelievable insight on how to put that character together, and he would tell me, like, he would listen to Pink Floyd or he would listen to Black Sabbath which, you know... that got me, ‘Okay I’m gonna get some heat for this’.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"I would look in the Bible for different verses. Back then it didn’t bother me as much to alter it around a little bit, you know, who am I tell?”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“So I started looking outside the box on how to put all this together and become this character. He didn’t even tell me this, but I heard him tell someone else - ‘once the music starts you are that person’.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"I probably took it a step further because I stayed that person for the first five or six years. He had so many good innovative ways to put things together and to look at different aspects of the business that no one got.”</blockquote>
