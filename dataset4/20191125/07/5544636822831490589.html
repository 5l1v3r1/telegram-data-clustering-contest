      <p>Dr Mohammed Salihu, Medical Director, National Orthopaedic Hospital Dala (NOHD), Kano, says the hospital now receives patients from aboard for joint replacement, spine surgeries and other specialised <a href="http://concisenews.global/health">orthopaedic surgeries</a>.</p>
      <p>Salihu said this in an interview with a NAN correspondent, who visited the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Prosthetic and Orthotic Centre of the hospital in Kano.</p>
      <p>According to him, it is longer no necessary for Nigerians to travel abroad for orthopaedic surgeries.</p>
      <p>“We can do most of the surgeries that people go outside the country to do, particularly joint replacement; we also do hip and knee replacement, as well as spine surgeries.</p>
      <p>“The hospital also has new sub areas with surgeons, who can open up patient’s back and straighten it and get them back to walk;  we opened up that newly, it was not there before.</p>
      <p>“For me, I will say that for any Nigerian to say he is going abroad for treatment of joint replacement and spine surgeries it is no longer necessary.</p>
      <p>“We now receive patients from other international communities about these ailments.’’</p>
      <p>According to him, the hospital handles patients from Niger Republic, Central African Republic, Cameroon, Chad and other international communities.</p>
      <p>The medical director said the strength of Orthopaedic surgeons had increased from three in 1980 to 30 only in Dala Hospital.</p>
      <p>“We are talking about 30 Orthopaedic surgeons in this hospital alone and we have them across the country; that does not to say that we don’t need more.</p>
      <p>“We will look forward to see Orthopaedic Surgeons in the suburbs, in some Local Governments, only then, we can say we are there.</p>
      <p>“Certainly, there is a lot of improvement in term of human resources in orthopaedic surgeries in the hospital,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the achievements of the hospital as it clocked 60 years on December 3, he said the hospital had recorded some remarkable achievements.</p>
      <p>Salihu said a lot had happened since 1959 till date and thanked God that the hospital had gone into sub-specialisation.</p>
      <p>“Gone are the days that patients will say they wanted to see Orthopaedic Doctors but today people can walk into our hospital and they can say, they want to see a Neuro-Surgeon.</p>
      <p>“They can request that they want to see a hip Surgeon; they can see a hand-surgeon so we have gone into sub-specialisation.</p>
      <p>“I believe going into sub-specialisation is useful to Nigerians because of expertise in those particular areas,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>NOHD is one the Federal Government oldest hospitals, established in 1959 to cater for people with orthopaedic and trauma problems.</p>
