      <h1>R140 Million Was Set Aside For Bank Of Lisbon Demolition</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:55:18+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/suzziegitau/" target="_blank">SG Editor</a></address>
      <p>The Gauteng Department of Infrastructure Development on Sunday said more than R100 million was budgeted for the Bank of Lisbon building’s demolition.</p>
      <p>The building was demolished on Sunday after a fire last September, which claimed the lives of three firemen.</p>
      <p>A new building will be erected as part of an inner-city rejuvenation project which will see 17 other buildings being renovated.</p>
      <p>The Gauteng infrastructure development portfolio said the demolition of the Bank of Lisbon building was a success and that clean-up operations would be completed by early next year.</p>
      <p>At least R140 million was budgeted for the complete demolition project, with R90 million of that used for Sunday’s implosion. The final costs will only be determined when clean-up operations are completed.</p>
      <p>MEC Tasneem Motara said: “To date, we have spent just [about] R90 million. We will know at the end of the process what the total is.”</p>
      <p>The inner-city rejuvenation project will see the renovation of 17 other buildings with the area being names the Kopanong Precinct.</p>
      <p>Proposals on the precinct have already begun.</p>
