      <p>In 2017, the makers of Baashha had digitally remastered the popular <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/rajinikanth/">Rajinikanth</a>-starrer, releasing it in 80 theaters across Tamil Nadu. After two years, here is a chance for Thalaivar fans to revisit the film.</p>
      <p>The Suresh Krissna-directorial will be re-released on December 11 ahead of Rajinikanth’s birthday. The official handle of Sathya Movies revealed Baashaa will be released in select cities worldwide.</p>

      <p>A lean rehash of Hindi hit Hum, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say Baashha catapulted Rajinikanth into superstardom.</p>

      <p>After the release of Padayappa, Suresh Krissna and Rajinikanth discussed the possibility of making a sequel to the cult classic Baashha. However, the idea was dropped as Rajinikanth doesn’t believe in sequels.</p>
      <p>In Suresh Krissna’s book My Days With Baashha, the director had written, “Every few years, questions and speculations about a sequel to Baashha keep coming up. When Rajini has given several other hits, it is this one that heads the list. Rajini and I have concluded that Baashha should be left alone, maybe. We felt its magic is inimitable.”</p>
      <p>In most of his interviews, Suresh Krissna has remarked people don’t remember his other films, but always end up asking questions on Baashha.</p>
      <p>Baashha, featuring music by Deva, revolves around the story of an ordinary autowallah who has a dreaded past. Shot in five months, the film ran in theaters for 175 days. The Rajinikanth-starrer is also famous for punch lines, including “Naa oru thadava sonna nooru thadava sonna maari”, which remains a favourite among the audience.</p>
