      <p>A British man and his wife have been rescued during a dramatic gun battle in the Philippines a month after they were abducted by Islamic State-affiliated militants.</p>
      <p>Allan Hyrons, 70, and his wife Welma Paglinawan-Hyrons, were dragged across a beach resort in southern Zamboanga del Norte province in October.</p>
      <p>Witnesses said they were taken from a hut to a waiting motorboat in the middle of the night by gunmen from Abu Sayyaf, a group allied to Isis.</p>
      <p>On Monday, regional military commander lieutenant general Cirilito Sobejana said his troops rescued the couple after a brief gun battle with militants.</p>
      <p>Mr and Mrs Hyrons were safely rescued in the southern province of Sulu, he said.</p>

      <p>They will undergo a medical check-up and be interviewed by military officials before they are released, Mr Sobejana said.</p>
      <p>Mr and Mrs Hyronsâ€™ abduction sparked a massive search in Zamboanga del Norte, which is located approximately 1,500 kilometres south of Manila.</p>
      <p>The Islamist Abu Sayyaf group has often been behind kidnapping foreigners for ransom and has carried out suicide bombings in the region.</p>
      <p>A sustained campaign against such groups by security forces has reduced the problem in recent years, but incidents continue to occur.</p>
