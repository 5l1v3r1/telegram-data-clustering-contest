      <h3>William Kentridge, God’s Opinion Is Unknown, 2019</h3>
      <p>“Outside the studio,” says the South African, “the artist needs to behave as a good citizen. Inside the studio, she/he needs to be faithful to where the work leads.”</p>

      <h3>Ilya and Emilia Kabakov, We Are Free!, 2018</h3>

      <h3>Shirin Neshat, from The Home of My Eyes series, 2015-19</h3>
      <p>“I was born an Iranian,” says Neshat. “My country has undermined basic human rights, particularly since the Islamic Revolution. I have gravitated toward making art that is concerned with tyranny, dictatorship, oppression and political injustice. Although I don’t consider myself an activist, I believe my art – regardless of its nature – is an expression of protest, a cry for humanity.”</p>

      <h3>Chiharu Shiota, Being Human, 2019</h3>
      <p>The Japanese installation artist, known for her use of yarn in large-scale works, says: “Art is the soul of society. Those who create art invite others to question their humanity and existence.”</p>

      <h3>Shilpa Gupta, No Title, 2012-19</h3>
      <p>Text, language and poetry feature strongly in the work of Gupta, who lives in Mumbai. Although her art often touches on political and social histories, as well as borders and dissidents, she prefers the term “everyday art” to “political art”.</p>
