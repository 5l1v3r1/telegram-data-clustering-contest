      <h1>Watch Out, Oscars - '1917' Is Here, and It's the Real Deal</h1>
      <h2>Sam Mendes’ World War I epic looked like a strong Oscar contender as it wowed voters and press in a series of screenings in Los Angeles and New York</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:11:35+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/steve-pond/" target="_blank">Steve Pond</a></address>
      <p>Sam Mendes’ immersive World War I epic “1917” was finally unveiled for awards voters and press on Saturday in New York and Sunday in Los Angeles, and this year’s awards race has now changed dramatically.</p>
      <p>Far more than Clint Eastwood’s “Richard Jewell,” which premiered at the AFI Fest on Wednesday, “1917” appears to be a strong contender, maybe even a frontrunner, in a host of categories, definitely including Best Picture and Best Director but also Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, Best Production Design and plenty of other below-the-line categories.</p>
      <p>I’m not ready to predict a Best Picture win after seeing it on Sunday morning, but I would place it in the top four likeliest nominees, alongside “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood,” “The Irishman” and “Parasite.” And given the uncertainties of this year’s race, I think it might have a pretty good chance of becoming the first late-breaking film to skip the festivals and still win Best Picture since “Million Dollar Baby” in 2004, and the first war movie to grab the top Oscar since “The Hurt Locker” in 2009.</p>

      <p>Reviews are embargoed until Monday, but it’s safe to say that “1917” is both a wrenching emotional experience and a technical tour de force in a way that will necessitate voters to pay attention.</p>
      <p>Yes, it’s a war movie, which conventional wisdom says is a genre that appeals more to men than women. (“Ford v Ferrari” is supposed to be a guy’s movie, too, but it’s playing extremely well across the board.) And yes, it’s sometimes hard to watch the brutality of war as it’s encountered by two young soldiers played by George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman, as they embark on a near-suicide mission to bring a vital message to the front lines.</p>
      <p>But the tears in the Arclight Hollywood on Sunday afternoon and the raves on Twitter all weekend suggest that Mendes’ film is more universally appealing than the war-movie label might suggest.</p>
      <p>It’s also a marvel of craftmanship, starting with cinematography legend Roger Deakins’ work. The film is shot in what is designed to look like one continuous take, and for most of the film I figured he was a shoo-in for a nomination based on the intricate camera movement alone. But then comes an extended sequence shot in a burned-out French town that is as staggering visually as anything Deakins has ever done, making it hard to envision anyone else winning in that particular category this year.</p>

      <p>Deakins finally won his first Oscar in his 14th nomination for “Blade Runner 2049” two years ago, which might have passed the mantle as the most-nominated and most-deserving person never to win to composer Thomas Newman, who also has 14 nominations. Newman’s alternately disquieting and rousing music to “1917” will also certainly be his 15th, and ought to give him by far his best chance at an Oscar win.</p>
      <p>In other below-the-line categories, the film will no doubt be extremely strong, with the only question mark, perhaps, coming in editing. There, it could fall victim to the same question that hurt “Birdman” five years ago: If a film looks like it was done in a single shot, doesn’t that mean the editor had less to do? (Highly respected editor Lee Smith, who won the Oscar for “Dunkirk” two years ago and also edited this one, might beg to differ.)</p>
      <p>Given the across-the-board achievements of the film and the daring way it was constructed, Mendes will certainly be in the top rank of Best Director contenders, alongside Martin Scorsese for “The Irishman,” Quentin Tarantino for “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” and Bong Joon Ho for “Parasite.” That field is very crowded this year (other contenders including Noah Baumbach for “Marriage Story,” Greta Gerwig for “Little Women,” Taika Waititi for “Jojo Rabbit,” James Mangold for “Ford v Ferrari” and Pedro Almodovar for “Pain and Glory”), but it’s hard to imagine that “1917” will get serious awards consideration without Mendes being at the center of it.</p>
      <p>The real questions, perhaps, are in the Best Original Screenplay category, where high-octane films often get overlooked, and in acting. Though the cast also includes Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and Mark Strong, it really is a two-person story with MacKay and Chapman. MacKay has more time on screen (which is to say that he’s in almost every shot), and he has to be considered a real Best Actor contender — but he’s also competing in a year in which Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, Joaquin Phoenix, Adam Driver, Antonio Banderas, Jonathan Pryce and Eddie Murphy are in the thick of the race, and it may not be easy for him to fight his way through that crowd.</p>

      <p>In the Q&amp;A that followed the Arclight screening, the first of four that he would do in Los Angeles on Sunday, Mendes talked about how the film grew out of stories he heard from his grandfather, who was used as a messenger between sentry posts in World War I. “For some reason, the image of one man carrying a message through that war stuck with me,” he said.</p>
      <p>The point of casting relative unknowns as the two leads, he said, was to give the audience the initial impression that these two young soldiers were “two among millions,” and let their heroism come slowly rather than be expected.</p>
      <p>As for the idea of letting the film unfold in what appears to be a single shot, Mendes said, “When I had the idea, it was to let the film play out in two hours of real time — but how do I make an audience emotionally connect? The technical challenges seemed to be dwarfed by the emotional payoff of not leaving the two characters’ sides.”</p>
      <p>The strategy paid off with audiences on Saturday and Sunday. It seems destined to pay off with voters, too.</p>

The impressive cast of pop star royalty behind “Hustlers,” including Jennifer Lopez, Cardi B and Lizzo, helps bring some hip hop attitude and style to the true story of a group of strip club dancers who swindled their clientele of often corrupt Wall Street brokers. Lorene Scafaria’s (“Seeking a Friend For the End of the World”) film is inspired by a New Yorker magazine article by Jessica Pressler, and the finished product is like if “Ocean’s 8” met “The Wolf of Wall Street.” Constance Wu, Julia Stiles, Keke Palmer and Lili Reinhart also star in the film.<cite>STX Entertainment</cite></figcaption>

The sweeping space scenes look impressive, but the film has been pushed back several times as a result of the Disney-Fox merger.<cite>20th Century Fox</cite></figcaption>

Rather than your typical superhero origin story, the backstory of the famed Batman villain stars Joaquin Phoenix as part of a larger character drama as he struggles with his career as a comedian and seeks acceptance in society. Zazie Beetz, Robert De Niro, Marc Maron, Shea Whigham and Brian Tyree Henry also star in the film that nods to Martin Scorsese cult favorites like "The King of Comedy."<cite>Warner Bros.</cite></figcaption>

Hawley's story is loosely inspired by the criminal activity of Lisa Nowak, an astronaut who was charged with the attempted kidnapping of a U.S. Air Force captain. Jon Hamm, Dan Stevens, Zazie Beetz, Nick Offerman, Ellen Burstyn and Tig Notaro also star in the drama.<cite>Fox Searchlight</cite></figcaption>

But the star of the film is really the advanced CGI technology in which Smith also plays the de-aged version of himself. The filmmakers accomplished the feat in a different manner than the de-aging used on Samuel L.

A poor family of conmen pose as expert tutors and servants and swindle their way into cushy jobs with an eccentric and gullible rich family.

In the film directed by Joachim Rønning, Maleficent starts a battle after forbidding Aurora (Elle Fanning) from marrying a young prince.

The cast, particularly Stone, has exploded in stardom since the original's release, so a sequel now seems like a no-brainer.

It's not just Arnold Schwarzenegger who's back, but also the original Sarah and John Connor, Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong, who are fighting the war for humanity.

It's a massive gangster throwback to Scorsese's heyday of "Goodfellas" and "Casino," bringing back Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel and even Joe Pesci out of retirement. It even pairs Al Pacino with Scorsese for what is incredibly the first time. But much of the film hinges on de-aging technology that makes De Niro and Pacino look decades younger in a saga about the man who claims he killed union boss Jimmy Hoffa.<cite>Netflix</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Queen &amp; Slim" - Nov. 27 (Universal)  <br/></b>"Queen &amp; Slim" is more than the story of the "black Bonnie &amp; Clyde." Director Melina Matsoukas's debut film, with a script by Lena Waithe, is a timely American odyssey about a mismatched couple who see the country and all its colors. The two are on the run for the killing of a police officer during a traffic stop gone wrong. But it also is meant to be a universal story of being black in America as seen through the eyes of stars Daniel Kaluuya and newcomer Jodie Turner-Smith.<cite>Universal Pictures</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"The Aeronauts" - Dec. 6 (Amazon)  <br/></b>Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones go sky high in the visually impressive period drama from Tom Harper. Set in 1862, the film pairs a sheepish scientist (Redmayne) and a wealthy widow (Jones) as they attempt to soar to unprecedented heights in a hot air balloon. The film boasts some stunning aerial cinematography and also includes supporting performances from Himesh Patel and Tom Courtenay.<cite>"The Aeronauts" / Amazon Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Jumanji: The Next Level" - Dec. 13 (Sony)  <br/></b>"Jumanji: The Next Level" mixes up the fun of the last film by having the video game avatars played by Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan jumble the human counterparts they're portraying. The twist allows the original cast to return without rehashing the same jokes and performances. And this time they're joined by Danny DeVito, Danny Glover and Awkwafina as they brave an arid desert and snowy mountain in the world's most dangerous game.<cite>Sony</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"A Hidden Life" - Dec. 13 (Fox Searchlight)  <br/></b>At its premiere in Cannes, "A Hidden Life" earned Terrence Malick his best reviews since 2011's "The Tree of Life." The World War II-era drama is just as spiritual and freeform as all his recent movies. But this one is based on the true story of an Austrian farmer named Franz Jägerstätter (August Diehl), a conscientious objector who refused to fight for the Nazis. The nearly three-hour saga chronicles his love story with his wife, played by Valerie Pachner.<cite>Fox Searchlight</cite></figcaption>

Love it or hate it, Tom Hooper's big-screen adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage hit has created enormous buzz, and we're purring at the chance to finally see it.<cite>Universal Pictures</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" - Dec. 20 (Disney)  <br/></b>"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" marks the conclusion to the Skywalker saga and perhaps the set-up for what fans can expect from future big-screen trilogies from both the "Game of Thrones" showrunners and Rian Johnson. J.J. Abrams, back on board after directing "The Force Awakens," has already revealed that Emperor Palpatine is still threatening the galaxy. And he's teased that there's "<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/jj-abrams-teases-theres-more-to-the-story-about-reys-parents-in-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker/">more to the story</a>" of Rey's parentage than Kylo Ren previously let on.<cite>Walt Disney Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Bombshell" - Dec. 20 (Lionsgate)  <br/></b>Director Jay Roach's look at the downfall of Fox News' Roger Ailes is told from the perspective of the women who accused him of sexual harassment. Margot Robbie stars as a fictional news producer at the cable news giant, while Charlize Theron plays Megyn Kelly, Nicole Kidman is Gretchen Carlson and John Lithgow is Ailes. The script is by "The Big Short" writer Charles Randolph.<cite>Lionsgate</cite></figcaption>

Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen, Timothée Chalamet, Laura Dern and Meryl Streep star in the story that's been updated to play on new gender norms, with a modern sensibility.<cite>Columbia Pictures</cite></figcaption>

Director Sam Mendes has assembled a cast that includes Benedict Cumberbatch, Richard Madden, Colin Firth, Andrew Scott and George MacKay for this tense war epic.<cite>Universal</cite></figcaption>
