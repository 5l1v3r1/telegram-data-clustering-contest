      <p>The incident comes at a time the aviation industry is on the spot over safety concerns.</p>
      <p>Last week, a light aircraft made an emergency landing at the Malindi International Aiport after losing one of its wheels mid-air.</p>
      <p>The aircraft, Cessna 152, belonging to the Kenya School of Flying, was being operated by a trainee pilot during the incident. He was the sole occupant of the plane.</p>
      <p>Malindi airport manager Mohammed Karama confirmed the incident saying the trainee identified as Emmanuel Omindi had to fly for two hours to avoid explosion when landing.</p>
      <p>“The control tower noticed that its fore wheel was missing while mid-air and the pilot was advised to fly for two hours due to security reasons,” said Karama.</p>

      <p>No casualties were reported during the incident.</p>
      <p>“He crash-landed but he did not suffer injuries, although he was taken to the hospital together with his tutor who was directing him while mid-air for psychological counselling due to trauma,” he said.</p>
      <p>Recently, the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority industry suspended Silverstone Air flight over incidents and accidents involving planes operated by the airline.</p>
      <p>KCAA lifted the suspension last week saying, the carrier had provided satisfactory corrective measures following comprehensive compliance audits on its operations between October 25 and November 15, 2019.</p>
