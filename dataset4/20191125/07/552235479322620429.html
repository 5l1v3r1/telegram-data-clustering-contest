      <h1>Hamilton Accies coach Matt Boyle says it's all about kids having fun</h1>
      <h2>The elite junior academy head will be delighted to see 'one of his boys' break into the Accies first team.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Andy McGilvray, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/andy-mcgilvray/</a></address>
      <p>Matt Boyle will be delighted to see ‘one of his boys’ breaking through to Hamilton Accies’ first team, but he’s at his happiest seeing kids playing football and having fun.</p>
      <p>Boyle, 35, is head of the elite junior academy and, as such, isn’t one of the more high-profile figures at the New Douglas Park club, though he has been there for nine years.</p>
      <p>However, he is the first point of contact for youngsters who arrive on the conveyor belt before they meet under-16 coach Darian MacKinnon and Dougie Imrie at under-18s.</p>
      <p>Matt says it’s all about kids coming in and enjoying themselves.</p>
      <p>“It will be brilliant once one of ‘my guys’ makes it into the first team, but it’s not just them – it’s brilliant to see any kid make the first team, whether they come later on like Jamie Hamilton or Reegan Mimnaugh,” said Matt.</p>
      <p>“It’s brilliant for the kids who are coming through to see people hitting the first team. If they’ve been here since they were eight, it’s even better, because it’s brilliant to see them growing up and becoming young men, and on the first rung of their football career.”</p>
      <p>Matt continued: “I look after the junior academy, so when kids first come through the door at 8, 9, 10, I’ll be their first point of contact.</p>
      <p>“What will happen is that we have our pre-Academy, which sits below our league tier, and that’s for kids who are eight or nine, who will come in after being scouted – we have a good team of scouts who will go out and identify the best talent in the west.</p>
      <p>“They will come to us, they will train and have a games programme as well, and for us that’s the most important age groups – nines and 10s are really important, because it’s a free-for-all in the pre-Academy. Kids can go anywhere, they can be at Celtic, Rangers, Hearts, Hibs, Motherwell, Hamilton, every single night of the week, so it’s important that when they come in there is a fun factor, an element where they want to come back, because the club are trying to turn them into mini-Hamilton Accies fans as well.</p>

      <p>“Once they turn nine, they can then sign for the club, we sign them on an Academy form, and they will become part of our under-11 group, which then jumps into a league tier and a league band programme, our Club Academy Scotland, and it’s gaining some training to get to the next run, so 11s go into 12s, 12s into 13s and so on.</p>
      <p>“Our job is to get them from nines, 10s, 11s, 12s into 13s, and once they hit under-16s, that’s when they start going into Darian MacKinnon’s bracket, and under-18s it’s Dougie Imrie, but overall George Cairns, who is the Academy director, will look after everything.</p>
      <p>“George puts a lot of trust in me to get it right at the younger age groups, he has a big emphasis on the younger age groups, because if we get it right at nine or 10, generally we try to bring them all the way through and they will go through the pathway.</p>
      <p>“There are other coaches here who have been here for a long time, guys like Kevin Taggart, Mark Conroy, who look after the young groups, and there is a good band of youth coaches as well, who take them into the tactical element of the game.</p>
      <p>“We’re more the technical side of producing football players, and getting them to fall in love with the game. When they go to Dougie, they’re a well-oiled machine, and that’s what we’re looking for.”</p>
      <p>Matt says the standard of football even at youth level has evolved massively, since he started at the club in 2010, but it is getting slightly easier to convince parents and kids that Hamilton Accies is the club for them.</p>
      <p>“It sounds quite big-headed to say we’re the best at what we do, but the proof is in the pudding,” said Matt.</p>
      <p>“When you look at the stats every week for the minutes on the pitch for kids under-23, we top it again, but we have evidence to back that up. We have a good reputation. All of that is irrelevant, though, if the kids don’t come and enjoy it.</p>

      <p>“When I first came here it was difficult to convince people to come here, because I came from under-17s to under-11s. When I was asking boys who they used to play for I expected a local boys’ club, but it was Celtic, Rangers, Hearts – they had been everywhere.</p>
      <p>“At that time it was still difficult to convince players not to go to Celtic and Rangers, but now it’s not as hard, because parents and kids are more switched on, to see that if they want a chance to go through a system and onto a pathway, this is probably one of the only places where they’re going to get that opportunity.</p>
      <p>“They might stay at Celtic or Rangers, and they might get lucky – they might be the next Kieran Tierney, but those are very few and far between.</p>
      <p>“Technique and coaching has evolved massively and it has kind of gone full circle. When I first started, if you were to go to probably any session, at any club, it would probably have been the same and it would have been the same kind of players we were all producing.</p>
      <p>“Everybody wanted to be Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, and they all had really good technical ability, but now it’s more game-intelligent players, and small-sided games play a massive part in that, as well as their technique, and I see the game evolving massively in Scotland.</p>
      <p>“There are a lot of talented kids out there, right through all clubs. You don’t get easy games any more, because all the kids are so good. It’s because for coaches there are a lot more resources for them now, because of social media, where they can go and get more content from any club in the world, and people are sharing ideas, which is helping a lot of people’s coaching practices now to go and help kids. Ultimately that’s why we all do it, but coaches are getting better, techniques are getting better, and the players are getting better.</p>
      <p>The best part of my job is at 5.30pm when the kids come through the door and you see them.</p>
      <p>“They’re buzzing to get two hours on the pitch, to get a touch of the ball, and their stories and their banter is brilliant, then just watching them play, because they’re excellent.</p>
      <p>“I’m not just saying that because they’re Hamilton players, but kids at younger ages are getting better and better all the time, and whey they come in, the stuff they can do amazes me, and when they go on the pitch that’s when they come alive.</p>
      <p>“That’s what you’re here for – no matter how good or bad a day you’re having, the minute they come through that door everything is forgotten about and that’s your focus.”</p>
