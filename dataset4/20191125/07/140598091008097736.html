      <h3>Boris Johnson pitches 'safety first' Conservative manifesto</h3>
      <p>Boris Johnson has pledged to "release the lion from its cage" by spending up to £100 billion over the next five years to "forge a new Britain" in the aftermath of Brexit. However, at the <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=he39d8a6,332f7de6,332f7df2">launch of the Conservative manifesto</a> in Telford yesterday, the Prime Minister made it clear he will not enter a spending competition with Jeremy Corbyn as he unveiled an unapologetically cautious programme. <b>Camilla Tominey</b> analyses how the Prime Minister has pitched a <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=he39d8a6,332f7de6,332f7df3">"safety-first" Conservative manifesto</a> at swing voters rather than the Tory faithful. <b>Taha Lokhandwala</b> explains what the manifesto <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=he39d8a6,332f7de6,332f7df4">means for your money</a> and here is a <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=he39d8a6,332f7de6,332f7df5">summary of the 59-page document's key policies</a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Labour has been accused of <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=he39d8a6,332f7de6,332f7df6">"driving a coach and horses" through its fiscal rules</a> with its £58bn pledge to compensate women pensioners. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the plan to compensate women left out of pocket by the rise in the state pension age would lead to "another £12bn of borrowing every year for the next five years", on top of what Labour has already promised to spend. And economists have warned electing the Labour Party could <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=he39d8a6,332f7de6,332f7df7">trigger a run on the pound</a> in a "sudden and dramatic reaction" on the markets.</p>
      <h3>Police failure to investigate allegations against Duke questioned</h3>
      <p>Scotland Yard is coming under increasing pressure to explain why it <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=he39d8a6,332f7de6,332f7df8">failed to carry out a full investigation</a> into allegations that a teenager had been trafficked to the UK to have sex with the Duke of York. Four years ago the Metropolitan Police received a complaint alleging that in 2001, 17-year-old Virgina Roberts-Giuffre was flown to London by paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and coerced into having sex with Prince Andrew. The renewed pressure comes as the Prince of Wales will this week <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=he39d8a6,332f7de6,332f7df9">demand what is likely to be a heated showdown</a> with his younger brother, over the continued fallout from the disastrous Newsnight interview. And <b>Victoria Ward</b> and <b>Robert Mendick </b>reveal it is <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=he39d8a6,332f7de6,332f7dfa">affecting the endeavours of his youngest daughter</a>, who co-founded an anti-slavery charity.</p>
      <p>Convent shut after nun falls in love with man and is told to leave</p>
      <p>A picturesque 17th-century convent in the Tuscan hills has <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=he39d8a6,332f7de6,332f7dfb">had to shut its doors</a>only four years after reopening, due to an impossible "love story". The Convent of the Cappuccini Fathers in Sansepolcro, which has been run by Benedictine nuns since 2015 – has been closed "definitively", its website says, despite the ongoing projects unveiled by Sister Maria Teresa, the dynamic mother superior. The reason for the sudden closure is reported to be because a 40-year-old nun fell in love with a local man, and was obliged to leave. <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=he39d8a6,332f7de6,332f7dfc">Read on for details</a>.</p>

      <p>A newborn lamb sticks its tongue out standing next to its mother in the lambing sheds at The Olde House, Chapel Amble, Cornwall. The milder Cornish weather affords the working farm two lambing seasons over the year. Around 500 lambs are expected to be born this autumn. <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=he39d8a6,332f7de6,332f7e02">Click here to see more pictures of the day</a>.</p>

      <h3>Sport briefing</h3>
      <p><b>Sheffield United 3 - 3 Manchester United</b> | After going 2-0 down, somehow the away side found themselves 3-2 up having been utterly dominated, at times humiliated, by promoted Sheffield Utd for 71 minutes. That the home side then salvaged a draw, with a 90th-minute equaliser, after another VAR check, was the very least they deserved in <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=he39d8a6,332f7de6,332f7e16">a marvellous encounter</a>.</p>

      <h3>And finally...</h3>
      <p><b>Exams are passé </b>| A leading private school headmaster has become the latest to launch a GCSE alternative, as he says exam boards have made the flagship assessment too "tick boxy". Stephen Jones, the Warden of St Edward’s School in Oxford, said there is a growing feeling GCSEs are "passé" and no longer fit for purpose. <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=he39d8a6,332f7de6,332f7e1c">Here is how it will affect pupils</a> at the £39,480-a-year boarding school.</p>
