      <p>Talking about the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir, he said, "In 1952, Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee (founder of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the predecessor to the BJP) had said that there cannot be two Constitutions, two prime ministers and two flags in one country. We have fulfilled his dream and lived up to the promise made in our poll manifesto."</p>
      <p>He also said the country had sent out a clear message that it would not cower in the face of terrorism. "Rafale fighter jets are coming to India. We do not need to cross the borders now.
