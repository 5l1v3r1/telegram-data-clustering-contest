      <p>Melbourne - Melbourne will stage a <b>Bledisloe Cup</b> Test next year for the first time in a decade in a match that will be newly-appointed Australia coach Dave Rennie's first encounter against his home country New Zealand.</p>
      <p>The August 8 fixture, the first Rugby Championship game of 2020 on Australian soil, is part of a deal that will see at least one Test played in Melbourne annually for the next five years.</p>
      <p>In making the announcement on Monday, Rugby Australia said it will include one of the three showdowns during the British and Irish Lions tour in 2025.</p>
      <p>The move to Melbourne comes with Sydney's ANZ Stadium and Allianz Stadium both out of action for major redevelopments.</p>
      <p>It will mark Rennie's first match against the All Blacks since being appointed last week.</p>
      <p>The New Zealander will only take the reins in July next year, and will begin his tenure with two Tests at home against Ireland before facing his home nation.</p>
      <p>The fixture at Marvel Stadium, previously Docklands Stadium, will be part of a double-header with the Australian women facing their New Zealand counterparts ahead of the men's match.</p>
