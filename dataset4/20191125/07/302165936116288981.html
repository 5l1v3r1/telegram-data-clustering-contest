      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 25 — The Malaysia-China two-way trade is set to record another new high this year, judging by the first nine months of 2019 performance which has reached US$89.75 billion (US$1=RM4.17), up 11.3 per cent from the same period in 2018.</p>
      <p>Malaysia’s special envoy to China Tan Kok Wai said the total trade hit a record high of US$108.6 billion last year, which is 683 times compared with US$159 million in 1974, the year when both countries first established their formal diplomatic ties.</p>
      <p>“Malaysia-China trade volume is about one-fifth of the China-United States and one-third of China-Japan trade volume,” he told reporters after the launch of the second China-Malaysia ‘Belt &amp; Road’ Shaanxi Trade Expo here, today.</p>
      <p>In addition, Malaysia-China trade volume accounted for one-fifth of the total China-Asean trade.</p>
      <p>Earlier in his speech, Tan said the relationship between Malaysia and China is still stepping forward on the right track and set to become deeper, better and stronger.</p>
      <p>“Next year is the 2020 Malaysia-China Tourism Year. Malaysians always travel to China and we welcome more Chinese to visit Malaysia,” he added.</p>
      <p>Tan said last year, 2.94 million Chinese travelled to Malaysia, an increase of 29 per cent, from 2.28 million the year before.</p>
      <p>“This year, it is not a problem to break through the 3.0 million (mark) of Chinese tourists, as for the first six months, we have had a total of 1,558,782 Chinese tourists, which is an increase of 6.4 per cent compared with 1,464,911 in the same period last year,” he added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, China’s ambassador to Malaysia Bai Tian said Malaysia-China’s bilateral trade volume for the January-October 2019 period had exceeded US$100 billion.</p>
      <p>In his speech, he said China has become Malaysia’s largest trading partner for 10 consecutive years.</p>
      <p>The China-Malaysia ‘Belt &amp; Road’ Shaanxi Trade Expo is held concurrently with the Private Label Expo (MaPLE 2019) from today to November 27.</p>
      <p>A total of 320 exhibitors from Malaysia, China, Oceania, Thailand, and Africa is participating in MaPLE 2019, including 73 exhibitors from China’s Fujian province.</p>
      <p>As for the ‘Belt &amp; Road’ trade expo, a total of 92 exhibitors joined the expo, out of which 75 exhibitors are from Shaanxi province and 17 exhibitors from Malaysia. — Bernama</p>
