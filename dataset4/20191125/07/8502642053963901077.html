      <p>TAIPEI, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Taiwan's central bank and Ministry of Economic Affairs have set up a group to coordinate stepped up purchases of U.S. goods, two sources said, as its seeks to narrow its trade surplus and head off being labelled a currency manipulator.</p>
      <p>Taiwan was last labelled a currency manipulator by the United States in December 1992 and was then on the U.S. Treasury monitoring list in 2016 and 2017.</p>
      <p>Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States this year is expected to pass $20 billion, meeting one of the criteria Washington uses to decide the monitoring list for a currency manipulator. Taiwan's current account surplus is 11% of GDP, which also matches another criteria to be labelled a currency manipulator, as the threshold is 2%.
