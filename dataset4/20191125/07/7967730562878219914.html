      <p>An asylum seeker who says she was raped by a security guard while in detention on Nauru has settled her case against Wilson Security on the day it was due to go to court after a five-year legal battle.</p>
      <p>“I want everyone to know what was happening to women on Nauru and what it was like for us,” the now 32-year-old woman said in a statement.</p>

      <p>This is the first time a female plaintiff has gone public about getting a settlement for sexual assault at the Nauru Regional Processing Centre. Details of the settlement are restricted.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court civil trial between the plaintiff and the defendant, Wilson Security, was set to begin on Monday but settled on the day it was due to start.</p>
      <p>The woman alleges a security guard employed by Wilson Security raped her in the women’s sleeping area at night in August 2014, and she was also subjected to instances of sexual harassment.</p>
      <p>After the rape the asylum seeker suffered gynaecological injury, pelvic and abdominal pain and psychiatric injury, according to her amended statement of claim. She had to have substantial medical and related treatment, and now suffers from ongoing trauma.</p>
      <p>Wilson Security knew its employees at the regional processing centre were engaged in sexual misconduct and failed to address it, according to the women’s statement of claim.</p>
      <p>This meant the centre was an unsafe place for female detainees, and male security officers were allowed to enter the women’s sleeping area alone.</p>

      <p>Maurice Blackburn senior associate Nicki Lees said security guards at the centre were supposed to protect people seeking asylum and the plaintiff had been left traumatised.</p>
      <p>“This claim has highlighted the systemic and serious failures in how the processing centre was managed,” Ms Lees said. “Everyone ... recognises her bravery and strength in telling her story and coming forward in this ground-breaking case.”</p>
      <p>The woman alleges that Wilson Security employees traded items to detainees in return for sexual favours, and a male employee engaged in sexual conduct with male child detainees in the view of others.</p>
      <p>Before she was detained at the Nauru Regional Detention Centre, the woman was qualified and employed. Because of her injuries, she has been unable to work, her statement said.</p>
      <p>The Nauru detention facility was opened in 2001 as part of the Howard Government’s so-called “Pacific solution”. It was closed by Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in 2007 and reopened by Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard in 2012. As atMarch 31, 2019, there were no people in the processing centre.</p>
      <p>There have been other accusations of violence by Wilson Security employees against refugees and asylum seekers in detention centres in Nauru and Manus Island.</p>
      <p>Wilson Security has been contacted for comment.</p>
