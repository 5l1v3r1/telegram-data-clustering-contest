      <p>Actor Henry Cavill, who portrayed <i>Superman</i> beginning with <i>Man of Steel</i> in 2013 and in the 2017 movie <i>Justice League</i>, is insisting his time as the DC character isn’t over yet.</p>
      <p>“The cape is in the closet,” Cavill said in Men’s’ Health’s December cover story, reports variety.com.</p>

      <p>“It’s still mine. I’m not going to sit quietly in the dark as all the stuff is going on. I’ve not given up the role. There’s a lot I have to give for <i>Superman</i> yet. A lot of storytelling to do. A lot of real, true depths to the honest of the character I wasn’t to get into. I want to reflect the comic books.</p>
      <p>“That’s important to me. There’s a lot of justice to be done for <i>Superman</i>. The status is: You’ll see.”</p>
      <p>Cavill’s statement comes as Warner Bros. has refrained from announcing any new films starring the British actor since its decision to revamp the plan for the DC Extended Universe following <i>Justice League’s</i> flop.</p>
      <p>The most recent installments include 2018’s <i>Aquaman</i> – one of the most profitable movies of the year, grossing over $1 billion worldwide and <i>Shazam!</i> in April.</p>
      <p>Most recently, Cavill appeared in <i>Mission: Impossible – Fallout</i> alongside Tom Cruise and stars in Netflix’s TV adaptation of <i>The Witcher</i>.</p>
