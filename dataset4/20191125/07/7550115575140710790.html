        <b>After a stellar 2018/19 campaign with Hertha Berlin, Mark Grujic has stalled somewhat this season and he knows an uprise in form is needed to secure a place at Liverpool.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since arriving on Merseyside in 2016 as <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a>‘s first signing, Grujic has spent the majority of his time on loan, featuring for Red Star Belgrade, Cardiff City and currently Hertha Berlin.</p>
      <p>The Serbian has been plying his trade in the Bundesliga since the start of the 2018/19 season, and while an ankle injury would disrupt his campaign, the 23-year-old instantly became an integral member of Hertha’s midfield.</p>
      <p>He would make 22 appearances with a return of five goals, with former manager Pal Dardai declaring Grujic the “best midfielder” he’d seen during his 22 year spell at the club.</p>
      <p>However, Grujic has since struggled under new manager Ante Covic this season, who is himself under pressure after four successive league defeats.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool loanee was recently dropped for the 4-2 defeat at home to RB Leipzig prior to the international break and was withdrawn with 70 minutes on the clock in the 4-0 defeat to Augsburg on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The former was a decision which Grujic was expectedly disappointed with, but the 23-year-old is rightfully viewing his omission as motivation to “work harder” in training.</p>
      <p>“I was not the happiest person when I saw the lineup,” he told <i><a href="https://www.morgenpost.de/sport/hertha/article227713447/Marko-Grujic-Fuer-den-Trainer-ist-es-momentan-schwierig.html">Berliner Morgenpost</a></i>.</p>

      <p>“But it happens in football, it’s also a warning shot at me. It gives me the impulse to work harder in training</p>
      <p>“I’m still a young player, there are some fluctuations and I still have a lot to learn. But I’ve also changed my training a bit, sometimes I used to do too much for my legs in the gym and was not fresh enough in the games.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, sometimes something has to go wrong in life before you make a change, often for the better.</p>
      <p>“Maybe the concentration has dropped before us. But eleven points in eleven games are a clear warning, that’s not enough. In training, it really got down to business lately, that’s a good sign that everyone’s been awake.”</p>
      <p>While he faces stiff competition in the likes of <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/georginio-wijnaldum/">Gini Wijnaldum</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jordan-henderson/">Jordan Henderson</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/naby-keita/">Naby Keita</a> or <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alex-oxlade-chamberlain/">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a>, Grujic’s ultimate goal remains to play for Liverpool.</p>

      <p>But he acknowledges he must first “show better performances” with Hertha, who hold 100 percent of his focus.</p>
      <p>“Not often,” he added when asked if Klopp makes contact. “Liverpool play many games and have lent out many players.</p>
      <p>“But there is a responsible person who looks at the loaners, keeps in touch and gives feedback. We call after every game.</p>
      <p>“Everyone would, of course, like to play for such a team, but for that, I have to show better performances. But I do not think much of Liverpool, but of how we get on with Hertha from the current situation.”</p>
