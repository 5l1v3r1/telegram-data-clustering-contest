      <p>The invitations were sent by the 47 county commissioners in the country by way of Short Message Service (SMS).</p>
      <p>“Good afternoon <i>ndugu</i> (brother), kindly attend the BBI launch at Bomas on Wednesday," read the SMS message.</p>
      <p>Among some of the leaders who confirmed attendance include Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru, her Kakamega counterpart Wycliffe Opranya and National Assembly minority leader John Mbadi.</p>
      <p>Waiguru intimated that she would attend the event "not just to witness but to be part of this historic moment”.</p>
      <p>Deputy President William Ruto had on Saturday <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46779-dp-rutos-controversial-statement-leaves-egg-his-face-video">hinted about the meeting</a> while telling off Raila for promising that there would be a tsunami after the document's release.</p>
      <p>“The most important thing to Kenyans is fixing the infrastructure, fighting poverty and generating jobs for youth.</p>
      <p>“Every Kenyan would be given a chance to read and understand the report. That way, we would agree on how we would move forward together," the DP told a congregation at the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa in Thika, Kiambu County.</p>
      <p>The president and former prime minister are set to receive the document on Tuesday at State House.</p>
