      <h1>Dundee University rector Jim Spence backs strike action and criticises principal payout</h1>
      <h2>Dundee University rector Jim Spence has thrown his weight behind university strike action today while criticising the payout to departed principal Andrew Atherton.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:54:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/jakekeith/" target="_blank">Jake Keith</a></address>
      <p>Mr Atherton, who was on a salary of £254,000 a year, received six months’ wages in lieu of notice totalling £70,000 after leaving his post earlier this month.</p>
      <p>He had been suspended by the university pending an investigation into alleged failure to pay rent and bullying.</p>
      <p>Eight days of strike action begins today at universities and colleges across the UK – including Dundee and St Andrews – over pay, pensions and accusations of inequality.</p>
      <p>Mr Spence, who will join the picket line in Dundee, said the payment to Mr Atherton was ammunition for the strikers’ case.</p>
      <p>He said: “Much of the situation sits pretty badly with me.</p>
      <p>“You have Dundee University’s former principal walking away with a huge payout while many staff members have to fight for better conditions.</p>
      <p>“Some people seem to be treated almost as a deity in comparison to these staff.</p>
      <p>“Ordinary workers also deserve a fair crack of the whip.</p>
      <p>“It has to be addressed. There seems to be an imbalance.”</p>
      <p>Both St Andrews University and Dundee University will have picket lines at various locations throughout today.</p>
      <p>A joint rally featuring staff from both universities will also take place at Roseangle Church at around noon.</p>
      <p>The action is being orchestrated by the University and College Union (UCU).</p>
      <p>Dr Carlo Morelli, UCU Scotland president and senior lecturer at Dundee University, called on universities across the country to take action on staff concerns.</p>
      <p>He said: “Many are at breaking point. The action is very well supported and this is indicative of the strength of feeling among staff.</p>
      <p>“They want action on discrimination, poor pay and heavy workloads.</p>
      <p>“I would hope universities will realise how strong employees feel about this.”</p>
      <p>The two universities will be among 12 in Scotland and 48 others across the UK to take part in the industrial action.</p>
      <p>The dispute centres on changes to the Universities’ Superannuation Scheme (USS) and claims about a failure to improve pay, gender and race pay equality, casualisation and workloads.</p>
      <p>Dundee University and St Andrews University have both previously said all possible measures will be taken to minimise the strike’s impact on students.</p>
