      <h1>Blow for Perth as two more city centre stores shut their doors</h1>
      <h2>Perth city centre has been dealt a double blow after two big names announced they were pulling out.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:58:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/rossgardiner/" target="_blank">Ross Gardiner</a></address>
      <p>The popular children’s shoe shop This Little Piggy in South Methven Street will cease trading this month after 21 years in the city centre.</p>
      <p>Troubled clothing firm Bonmarche has also hung closing down banners in the windows of its High Street unit.</p>
      <p>The losses follow a number of closures earlier this year, including the weekly payment retailer Brighthouse and chocolate chain Thorntons.</p>
      <p>Bosses at This Little Piggy said the store had struggled against competition from online retailers.</p>
      <p>It is the last shop in Perth to specialise in fitting shoes for youngsters with splints and other medical conditions.</p>
      <p>Its second branch in Broughty Ferry will remain open. However, owner Pam Walker fears children who need special fittings could face problems in later life with no designated service in Perth.</p>
      <p>“It’s just been getting more difficult,” she said.</p>
      <p>“When I started there were five specialist children’s shoe shops in Glasgow and now there are none. There’s only one in Edinburgh too. I was offered to take on stores in Edinburgh, Stirling and Aberdeen but it’s not worth it.</p>
      <p>“Competing with online, minimum wage, family commitments and parents moving away from school shoes, is difficult,” she added.</p>
      <p>“We deal with a lot of children who have splints and have seen podiatrists. They will not get the same fitting service online and that could cause problems when they’re older.”</p>
      <p>Pam said the five members of staff employed in Perth were offered the chance to move to Broughty Ferry, but did not want to take on the commute.</p>
      <p>The branch will close at 5pm on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Bonmarche collapsed into administration last month, putting almost 2,900 jobs at risk.</p>
      <p>The retailer had buckled under a “sustained period of challenging trading conditions”, administrators said.</p>
      <p>The Perth branch was one of 318 stores across the UK.</p>
      <p>Data analysts PwC said 12 high street businesses in the fair city closed in the first half of this year, with seven opening in their place.</p>
      <p>City centre councillor Eric Drysdale said the losses of This Little Piggy and Bonmarche showed the difficulties facing independent traders and high street chains.</p>
      <p>The SNP councillor said: “There are huge challenges for small retail businesses.</p>
      <p>“It’s coming up for Black Friday and sales are enormous, which makes it all the more difficult. Bonmarche shows how difficult it is.</p>
      <p>“Perth is still a good business environment and it is particularly sad to see an established business with roots here having to close.”</p>
