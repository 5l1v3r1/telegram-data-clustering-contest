      <p><i>“Democracy is the worst form of government except for all the other forms.”</i> - Winston Churchill</p>
      <p>In the new ICC Test championship, Australia earned fewer aggregate points for their two wins and a draw in the Ashes series than they did for their single win over Pakistan in Brisbane this week. On the face of it, that is a travesty. What is this, the Senate?</p>
      <p>It works like this. In every series in the championship, 120 points are up for grabs. So in a five-match series, a win gets you 24 points. In a two-match rubber, it’s 60 points. Fair? See democracy, above.</p>

      <p>How else might it work? Ideally, all nine teams involved would play each other in a series of the same length, home and away, for identical reward. In this nirvana, there could be no quibble.</p>
      <p>In this earthly realm, it’s impossible. A full home-and-away round either would take too long to sustain interest, or it would mean cramming more into an already crowded program. The two years the ICC have allowed for this inaugural championship seems about right.</p>

      <p>So it is that each team plays six of the other eight in the cycle. Odd? Not from where I sit, with the AFL draw pinned up in front of me.</p>
      <p>It also means England’s current two-Test trip to New Zealand is excluded, which right now must seem to be a very good idea. It’s because England plays more Tests than any other country, and more away, and they can't all count. It’s hardly a fault. Everyone wants to play England, and India, less so Australia.</p>
      <p>For the record, Australia doesn’t play the West Indies and Sri Lanka in the championship. England misses out on New Zealand and Bangladesh, India on Pakistan and Sri Lanka. As imbalance goes, it’s roughly balanced.</p>
      <p>As for series length, between England, Australia and India, five Tests is hardly enough, but in most other combinations, two is barely viable.</p>

      <p>This very moment, some are lamenting that Australia and Pakistan are playing just two Tests here. But the crowd at the Gabba over four days was about what the Brisbane Lions draw on one good night.</p>
      <p>Seven say it held up in the TV ratings, but there comes a point where you have to ask about full lounge rooms and empty grounds: what is wrong with this picture?</p>
      <p>I detest that economic imperative, but I’m not the one who has to ask broadcasters and sponsors for more, or the players to accept less. Incidentally, the number of Tests in a series is by bilateral agreement. Or as Tim Paine would say, at Virat Kohli’s discretion.</p>
      <p>One proposed solution is for, say, two or three Tests in a series of five be nominated as championship games. That is too arbitrary. And it turns live rubbers into dead, the last thing Test cricket needs.</p>

      <p>So series of two, three, four and five Tests have to be reconciled. It’s called standardisation, a regular practice in other spheres. Look at this way: did Australia get too few points for their heroic efforts in England, or did they get a big fat bonus for comfortably beating a plain old Pakistan team at the Gabba?</p>
      <p>Besides, let’s face it, as much as we will revel in England’s humiliation in New Zealand, it takes a bit of the gloss off the Ashes. Not only that, Australia play New Zealand next, for championship points.</p>
      <p>Two previous versions of a Test championship failed to get off the drawing board. We’re roughly six months into the first live cycle. The players are excited, both about the prize and because it means there are no dead rubbers.</p>
      <p>The appeal of a proper title race is that it tests over time. Home, away, injuries, fluctuations in form: all have to be negotiated. One freakish moment might decide a tournament, but not a championship. For proof, look at Ben Stokes’ spoils in England this year.</p>
      <p>Wild cards will come into it: day-night matches for instances. Australia’s next two dates are under lights. But class and consistency will prevail.</p>
      <p>The final is set down for Lord’s in 18 months. If you’re doing your tips - whoever before has gotten to do that about Test cricket? - the likeliest finalists right now are India and Australia. But in the last two live series before the final - the last round if you like - Australia visits South Africa for three Tests and England is in India for five. It has the resonance of a crescendo. Let’s see.</p>
