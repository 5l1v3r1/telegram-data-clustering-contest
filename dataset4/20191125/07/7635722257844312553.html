        <b>Pro-democracy candidates in Hong Kong have scored a huge victory in district council elections, winning nearly 90% of the seats.</b>
      </p>
      <p>They won around 390 of 452 seats, according to local broadcaster RTHK, up from around 100 four years ago.</p>
      <p>A record 1,104 candidates stood in the poll and the turnout was a record 71% - equating to almost three million people. Last time it was 47%.</p>
      <p>One seat was still to declare because of a request for a re-count.</p>
      <p>The elections took on new significance because of months of clashes between Hong Kong authorities and protesters who say the Chinese government is eroding the territory's freedoms.</p>
      <p>The councils have little power - but the vote was seen by many as a gauge of public opinion on the protests.</p>
      <p>Among the winning candidates were rally organiser Jimmy Sham, who was beaten by people with hammers last month, and a candidate who had part of his ear bitten off by an attacker.</p>
      <p>One of those to lose his seat was pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho, who was stabbed with a knife while campaigning this month.</p>

      <p>Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam said the government respected the outcome and "will listen to the opinions of members of the public humbly and seriously reflect".</p>
      <p>She said she hoped the "peaceful, safe and orderly situation" in which the elections took place would continue.</p>
      <p>Winning candidates said she must now meet their demands, such as free elections for the city's leader and legislature, and a probe into claims of police brutality.</p>
      <p>"We won a small battle today but it shows that Hong Kong people have a chance to win the war. We will fight on," said one winner, Henry Sin Ho-fai.</p>
      <p>The council election is the only fully democratic one in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>The voting passed off peacefully, with long queues to vote and hardly anyone wearing the masks associated with the protesters.</p>
      <p>The candidates for next year's legislative council elections are drawn from the elected councillors.</p>
      <p>Petrol bombs and tear gas have become regular sights on Hong Kong's streets over the last six months as protesters battle police.</p>
      <p>The region's Polytechnic University was the most recent flashpoint, with protesters trapped inside as police blocked the exits.</p>
      <p>The unrest started over opposition to a law - which was eventually scrapped - that would have allowed people to be extradited to mainland China, but expanded to cover a general call for greater democracy.</p>
