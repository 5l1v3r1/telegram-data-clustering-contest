      <p><i><b>SIR</b>:</i> There is lack of development everywhere in the country but the situation in Benue state is more rotten and the Tiv people in the state should be blamed in view of the fact that they have been governing the state since its creation in 1976.</p>
      <p>It is true that the military government has also contributed in administering leadership in the state and we may like the military to have her share of the blame but I must confess that the military rule was even better for the state than the so called democracy and its team of robbers in the state.</p>
      <p>Let me exclude the late Governor Aper Aku and Rev. Father Moses Adasu from the list because during their eras they delivered the dividends of democracy to the people of the state and their legacies are what sustain the state now.</p>
      <p>Sadly, the set of Tiv the people now produce as leaders for the state have nothing reasonable to offer. They are only good at embezzling the public funds meant for the development of the state, they lack leadership skills and they are incompetent.</p>
      <p>Benue State produces the highest quantity of fruits with the best quality in the country but has no factory that converts these fruits into juice. The availability of the abundance fruits should has been seen as a business opportunity and equally, as an avenue to create jobs for the unemployed youth but the leaders in the state have problem when it comes to proper thinking, better initiative and execution of things that can bring development in the state.</p>
      <p>More sadly, the Tiv that have been ruling the state for years as if it is their birth right cannot also boast of any meaningful development in their areas.</p>
      <p>Leadership should change hand in Benue otherwise the state would one day go into extinction.</p>
