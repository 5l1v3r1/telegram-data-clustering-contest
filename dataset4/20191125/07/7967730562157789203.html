      <h1>No reason why Smith should not captain again: Lara</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Pierik</a></address>
      <p>West Indies great Brian Lara says Steve Smith has his faults but he remains a role model for youngsters and there is no reason why he should not captain Australia again.</p>
      <p>Lara knows all about the pressures that comes with leadership, having had three stints in the top job during an illustrious but controversial career where he finished with almost 12,000 Test runs.</p>
      <p>Smith's two-year ban from an official leadership role as a result of the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa expires in late March and he appears the man most likely to replace Tim Paine should there be a change. He has recently been re-installed as captain of the Rajasthan Royals in next year's Indian Premier League, with Lara declaring Smith been a fine leader until the "mishap" of Cape Town.</p>

      <p>"His leadership was up there with the very best. A mishap like that, he played a huge price for it. You look at the fact the he took over at Rajasthan Royals for the IPL season," he told <i>The Age-Sydney Morning Herald</i> on Monday.</p>
      <p>"The other 10 [Australian] guys that take the field with him, or the coaches, the management - I believe there is a lot of respect for him. Everyone has most likely put behind [them] what has gone on. I don't think that will be troublesome at all if he ever resumes that position at all.</p>
      <p>"He has come back from places that some of us have never experienced. I am talking about a couple of years ago. He is someone that youngsters should look up to. He is not a perfect human being, that you think that somebody should be. He has come back. He has made sure that he is a great example to follow."</p>

      <p>The Australian public has welcomed Smith back into the fold, which former Cricket Australia chief James Sutherland said would be an important element on whether the batting star could regain the captaincy. Unlike what transpired in England during the Ashes, there was no jeering of Smith during the first Test against Pakistan at the Gabba.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old has also shown great contrition, and has toured schools and told of his torment to teenagers, in part to help good friend Gus Worland and his Gotcha4life suicide prevention charity.</p>
      <p>CA may also need to take international politics or perceptions into account when assessing whether Smith should again be captain but Lara said that should not be factor.</p>

      <p>"I don't think there should be any fall out. Why should any other country or the ICC or anybody be worried about that? I think it's all Cricket Australia and how they want to move and who they want to see leading tea. It's no concern to any other cricketing nation," he said.</p>
      <p>Lara, 50, is in Melbourne for a speaking engagement - <i>A night with Brian Lara</i> - at the Palais Theatre on Thursday. There is plenty to discuss over a 17-year international career, including his stints as captain from 1996-2000, 2002-2005 and again in 2006, a year before he retired.</p>
      <p>"I got the job three times. The first time ... [it was] tumultuous times, who is pulling at you, who isn't pulling at you and stuff like that. A lot of people felt like I shoudn't be captain at that point," he said.</p>
      <p>"Moving away from the captaincy the first time, I would have learnt a lot. I definitely came with different ingredients as a leader the second time around.</p>
      <p>"The second time was curtailed not by me or by bad performances, it was a sponsorship issue. I got sacked because of it. Then I came back a third time and then I retired. I believe each and every time I was a better leader. The foundation of a good leader is his man management skill and I believe I was wanting in my first attempt as captain in that department."</p>
