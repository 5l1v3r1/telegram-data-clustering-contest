      <h1>Policeman repairs deadly Pothole on high street with his own money</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:47:13+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:47</time> by <a rel="author">â€Œ Qwame Benedict</a></address>
      <p>Some of you readers might remember that some months ago <a href="https://www.ghpage.com/">Ghpage.com</a> wrote an article of a Police officer who repaired a traffic light that had fallen down in one of the suburbs in Accra.</p>
      <p>Well, the police officer has once again melted the hearts of some social media users after new photos of him repairing a deadly pothole surfaced online.</p>
      <p>Lance Corporal Simon Agbeko who works with the Accra Regional Police Command inspired to patch up some of the road hazards at the Achimota overhead and the Abeka junction after he drove over the particularly pothole.</p>
      <p>According to him, he filled up the potholes to prevent accidents. He labeled the project to be part of his road safety campaign to drivers and motorists.</p>
      <p>He continued that these charitable acts he does on the streets are as a manifestation of divine directions from God, which he receives in his dreams.</p>
