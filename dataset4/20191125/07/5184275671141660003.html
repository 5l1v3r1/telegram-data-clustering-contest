      <h1>No Entry Sequel: Salman Khan Opts OUT Because Of Arjun Kapoor-Malaika Arora?</h1>
      <h2>The 2005 No Entry, featured Salman Khan, Anil Kapoor and Fardeen Khan alongside Lara Dutta, Bipasha Basu and Esha Deol in lead roles.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:39:34+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:39</time> by <a rel="author">Koimoi.com Team</a></address>
      <p>Post the shelving of Salman Khan-Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-news/not-inshallah-but-sanjay-leela-bhansali-gangubai-for-alia-bhatt/"><i>Inshallah</i></a>, a lot of speculations were doing the rounds surrounding the actor’s Eid 2020 release. One of the strongly rumored projects was the <i>No Entry</i> sequel, and producer Boney Kapoor had confirmed the movie being on the cards too! But looks like Salman won’t be a part of it after all and the reason is Arjun Kapoor.</p>
      <p>Yes, you heard it right! If recent reports by Deccan Chronicle are to be believed, Salman Khan has opted out of the project and it’s because the makers have plans to rope in Arjun Kapoor who is the beau of his ex-bhabhi, Malaika Arora.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, a source close to the development confirms his exit as, “Salman is out of the project. Boneyji and Anees will take a call very soon on who they want to cast in the role of Prem and will make an announcement once they get the right kind of star to take the franchise forward. The script has been ready for a long time and the project will mount the floors once the casting is done.”</p>
      <p>The 2005 comedy was a huge success and featured Esha Deol, Bipasha Basu, Lara Dutta and Celina Jaitly as the female leads of the film. While it is a no brainer that the sequel to the film too will be a multi starrer, many are speculating that Anil Kapoor will reprise a pivotal character in the film too.</p>
