      <p>Minister of State Ministry of Environment Sharon Ikeazor, has said an estimated 4.7 million Nigerians live without improved toilet and many still practise open defecation.</p>
      <p>The minister said they use the bush and water as their regular means of human waste disposal which is very unhealthy.</p>
      <p>Ikeazor spoke at the 2019 World Toilet Day in Abuja, with the theme: Toilet for All.</p>
      <p>She said many institutions did not have sanitary facilities and where they existed, they were either not functioning or misused.</p>
      <p>“According to the National Demographic and health survey, access to improved sanitation is very poor below 36 per cent for majority of the populace.</p>

      <p>“It is worthy to note that absence of adequate sanitary facilities in schools constitute a great threat to school enrolment, particularly for the female child.</p>
      <p>“Provision of sanitary facilities in schools must go hand-in-hand with other efforts to achieve basic education in the country. One of the consequences of poor excreta disposal is the high rate of diarrhoea disease which is a second cause of high morbidity and mortality amongst children under the age of five.</p>
      <p>“Sanitation crisis if allowed to continue will undermine the overreaching ambition of the 2030 agenda, to build safe, more resilient societies on a healthy planet and this means failure to attain the Sustainable Development Goal”.</p>
