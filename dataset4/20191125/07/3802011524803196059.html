      <p>The matter was remanded to November 8.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Mrs Tinashe Makiya alleged that last Thursday at around 10pm, a team of Detectives from Marondera raided Mututu’s residence.</p>
      <p>Upon arrival, the detectives knocked the door and identified themselves.</p>
      <p>Mututu refused to open the door and the detectives forced their way into Mututu’s room.</p>
      <p>It is the State’s case that Mututu, who was armed with an iron bar, charged towards Det Sgt Hove who was armed with a corked pistol.</p>
      <p>Mututu grabbed the firearm and attempted to disarm the detective, resulting in the firearm discharging a bullet that went on to hit the now deceased Detective Constable Munyaradzi Mudenda just above the eye.</p>
      <p>The other detectives eventually managed to subdue Mututu and arrested him.</p>
      <p>Following his arrest, Mututu led the detectives to the recovery of batteries, electrical cables, a bag containing herbicides, Nokia Lumia cellphone and HCT cell phone which are part of the property that was allegedly stolen at Secuta Farm in Goromonzi.<a href="https://www.herald.co.zw/bid-to-disarm-cop-ends-in-tragedy/"><b>The Herald</b></a></p>
