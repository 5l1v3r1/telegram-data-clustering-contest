        <b>Here's a helpful word to help make your Swedish sound more natural.</b>
      </p>
      <p>When you're learning a language, some of the words that can improve your fluency most quickly are the small filler words. In Swedish, that includes <i><a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20181001/swedish-word-of-the-day-oj">oj</a>, <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20181109/word-of-the-day-typ">typ</a>, <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20190423/swedish-word-of-the-day-liksom">liksom</a></i> – and <i>hoppsan</i>.</p>
      <p><i>Hoppsan</i> translates as 'oops', or 'whoops' in English. But it's slightly less common, and in the same context a Swede might instead say <i>oj, ojdå</i>, or simply <i>oops</i>. </p>
      <p><i>Hoppsan</i> acknowledges that something unfortunate, often unintended and unexpected, has happened; something's gone wrong. But it also implies that the problem isn't a serious one.</p>
      <p>It's about showing that there's been a mistake, and not about who's responsible, so you could say <i>hoppsan</i> whether it's you or someone else who's made the mishap.</p>
      <p>It has an informal and jokey tone and you'll often hear it said to children in a cheerful way, <i>"hoppsan!"</i>, if they fall over or drop something, to reassure them that it's no big deal.</p>
      <p>You'll also hear it among adults too, although less frequently. If you bump into a stranger, it would be more usual to say <i>oj</i> or <i>förlåt</i> (sorry) than the more friendly <i>hoppsan</i>.</p>
      <p>Among adults, <i>hoppsan</i> might be a neutral (and informal) acknowledgement of an accident (<i>hoppsan, jag tappade den</i> – whoops, I dropped it) but it could also be used teasingly or sarcastically, to make fun of someone being accident-prone or to imply that something wasn't really an accident.</p>

      <p>Expressions that sound a bit like <i>hoppsan</i> pop up frequently in European languages. As well as English 'oops', the French say <i>oups</i>, the Spanish say <i>opa</i>, and the Germans <i>hoppla</i>. </p>
      <p>The <i>-san</i> ending is specific to Swedish, and it's a common addition to exclamations. For example, <i>hejsan</i> is an alternative way to say 'hello', and <i><a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20181116/swedish-word-of-the-day-jajamensan">jajamensan</a>, </i>an emphatic agreement. <i>Jajamensan</i> has <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20181116/swedish-word-of-the-day-jajamensan">a different origin</a>, but the <i>-san</i> in <i>hejsan</i> and <i>hoppsan</i> probably comes from a shortening of <i>'sade han' </i>('he said'). In spoken Swedish the<i> -de</i> ending of <i>sade</i> is often dropped to become <i>'sa han'</i>.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Hoppsan, det tänkte jag inte på</i>
      </p>
      <p>Whoops, I didn't think about that </p>
      <p>
        <i>Hoppsan, jag råkade köpa nya skor!</i>
      </p>
      <p>Oops, I managed to buy more shoes</p>
