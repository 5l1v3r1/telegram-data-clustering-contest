      <h1>McLaren always favoured Alonso - Vandoorne</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/stoffel-vandoorne/"><b>Stoffel Vandoorne</b></a> says the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/mclaren/"><b>McLaren</b></a> team was built around <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/fernando-alonso/"><b>Fernando Alonso</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>Despite much fanfare after his junior career, Belgian Vandoorne struggled as Alonso's teammate with both Honda and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/renault/"><b>Renault</b></a> power.</p>
      <p>He is now a works Mercedes driver in Formula E, and he got his new season off to a good start with podium finishes at the Saudi Arabia opener.</p>
      <p>Vandoorne, 27, told Sport Voetbalmagazine that Formula 1 is a "fake world in which everyone defends their own interests".</p>
      <p>As for Alonso, he added: "I never had any problems with him, but he always got what he wanted.</p>
      <p>"There were always two, three well-placed people in the team who made sure everything went the way Fernando wanted it to be.</p>
      <p>"The team gave him all the support and power," Vandoorne continued. "Any driver would have benefited from extra equipment to perform better than his teammate."</p>
      <p>Despite that, and his premature departure from F1, Vandoorne insists he performed well next to Alonso.</p>
      <p>"On paper I never finished ahead of him, but of all the teammates I came the closest.</p>
      <p>"McLaren never told me not to finish in front of him, but they asked me in the race to let him pass. They almost always did that," he charged.</p>
      <p>So while F1 is a "fake" and selfish world, Vandoorne says there is life outside of the paddock.</p>
      <p>"In Formula E, Le Mans or WEC you will find pure racing at the moment. You come here to race, not to do politics.</p>
      <p>"Formula 1 remains the largest championship, but Formula E is just below that," the Belgian added.</p>
      <p>"It's the future. That's why you see more and more car manufacturers."</p>
