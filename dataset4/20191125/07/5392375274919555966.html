      <p>In September, Huawei officially released a new generation of Mate series smartphones in Germany – the Mate 30 series. At the same time, Huawei also brought the new Huawei Watch GT 2 sports smartwatch, which is the upgraded variant of last year’s WATCH GT. This smartwatch is available in 42mm and 46mm series. The 42mm version starts at 1388 yuan ($194), and the 46mm version starts at 1488 yuan ($209).</p>
      <p>This smartwatch comes with a new Kirin A1 chip, which supports BT/BLE dual-mode Bluetooth 5.1 standard, can realize ultra-high-speed Bluetooth data transmission, and supports intelligent power-saving algorithm 2.0. Moreover, the watch also added <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/09/03/huawei-watch-gt-2-will-use-a-larger-battery-built-in-speaker-and-microphone/">speakers and microphones</a> to make Bluetooth calls directly through the smartwatch. Compared to the previous generation, the Huawei Watch GT2 has a large internal storage space and can store about 500 MP3 songs.</p>

      <p>In terms of design, the Huawei Watch GT 2 inherits the classic appearance of the HUAWEI WATCH GT generation. But there are many improvements and upgrades in the details. Among them, we can mention the integrated 3D glass surface design. Although the screen size has not changed, this bulging and the glass surface of the body make the screen look extraordinarily large. So when looking at it, we have a feeling of ‘full screen’. Considering that the surface is convex, it is necessary to avoid contact with hard objects.</p>
      <p>There is still a circle around the body. But unlike the first generation, the digital scale on the Huawei Watch GT 2 is engraved on the glass. So the integration is more intense. In addition, the Huawei Watch GT 2 uses a very thin metal frame.</p>

      <p>On the top, it adopts a 1.39-inch AMOLED high-definition precision touch color screen. And the screen display resolution is 454*454, while the brightness reaches 1000 nits. The display effect is fine, the color saturation is high, and it is difficult for the naked eye to see the graininess of the screen. The 42mm model is more compact, and the curved surface mirror is gentle and soft. It has a 9.4mm ultra-thin body, weighing only 29g.</p>
      <p>In terms of functions, the Huawei Watch GT 2 has rich motion management and intelligent health management. Say, there are 15 sports modes (climbing, running, open pool swimming, cycling, etc.). But we’d like to focus on a couple of them – the gym mode and swimming heart rate monitoring.</p>
