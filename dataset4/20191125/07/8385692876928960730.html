      <p>Right now, the Lenovo Smart Clock <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">is on sale</a> for less than it will be on Black Friday, later this week. For Black Friday, the Lenovo Smart Clock is supposed to be $39.99 â€“ which is half off of its regular price. Not bad, right? Well, Lenovo's official store on Rakuten has it for just $34.</p>
      <p>To get this price, you'll need to sign in or sign up for a free Rakuten account (you get cash back, so it's definitely a good account to sign up for), and then use the promo code <b>LEN6B </b>at checkout.</p>
      <p>The Lenovo Smart Clock is a very small smart display from the company, and it runs with the Google Assistant. It's meant to work as a smart display that sits next to your bed, showing you the time. But you can also ask Google Assistant for things like the weather and traffic, and of course, control your smart home products as well.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>But it is sort of limited. You see, the Lenovo Smart Clock has a very small display, which means that it isn't all that great with playing video from YouTube, or even doing slideshows with your Google Photos albums. It's a smart display, but not as useful as one of the larger smart displays out there.</p>
      <p>It is still really nice for putting on a bedside table, or even in your kids room. Since it is pretty small, and it does work well as a clock. But if you're getting this, planning to watch YouTube in bed on it, you'll be disappointed.</p>
      <p>You can of course, use it to play music and such though, without any real issues.</p>
