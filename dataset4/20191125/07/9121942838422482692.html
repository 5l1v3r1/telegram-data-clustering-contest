      <p>IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — A national lottery group rocked by an insider’s conspiracy to rig jackpots has agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by a winner who contends his $9 million prize should have been larger.</p>
      <p>The Multi-State Lottery Association and Larry Dawson reached the settlement this month, cancelling a trial that had been set for Dec. 2 in Des Moines, Iowa.</p>
      <p>Dawson’s lawyer, Nicholas Mauro, says terms of the deal are confidential but his client is relieved to have the long-running litigation over.</p>
      <p>The association, which is owned by state lotteries, didn’t immediately return messages.</p>
      <p>Dawson, a financial adviser from Webster City, Iowa, won a $9 million Hot Lotto jackpot in 2011. His lawsuit claimed the game’s previous $16.5 million jackpot, which was rigged by association employee Eddie Tipton, should have carried over.</p>
      <p>Tipton is serving prison time in Iowa.</p>
