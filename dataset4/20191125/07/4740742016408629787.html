      <h1>How Lee Johnson was responsible for preventing rising star Joe Morrell from leaving Bristol City</h1>
      <h2>He signed a new contract last week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:33:46+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:33</time> by <a rel="author">James Piercy</a></address>
      <p>Mark Ashton admits that without the intervention of Lee Johnson in 2016, Joe Morrell would no longer be a Bristol City player.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/international-midfielder-explains-hes-extended-3560122">Morrell last week signed a new contract,</a> pledging his future to <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">the Robins</a> until 2022 as he enjoys a breakthrough campaign on loan at Lincoln City in League One.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has excelled at the heart of the Imps midfield, relishing in the responsibility of being a regular starter. That role has also seen him earn full Wales honours and play an important part in Ryan Giggs’ side qualifying for Euro 2020.</p>

      <p>However, it’s been a battle to get to this point for Morrell who, after first breaking into the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> side as a 16-year-old, found the weight of expectation difficult to bear and, as opportunities dried up, even considered quitting the game.</p>
      <p>Speaking this weekend to <a href="http://bcfc.co.uk/">bcfc.co.uk,</a> Ashton revealed that Johnson’s hands-on approach to nurturing youth talent, specifically Morrell, kept him in the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Robins</a> system.</p>
      <p>"I'm delighted not only for Joe Morrell but also everyone in the football club who's played a major part in his continued development," Ashton said.</p>
      <p>"When I joined this football club almost four years ago, I think it's fair to say there was a lot of people who thought Joe Morrell was on his way out of the club.</p>
      <p>"But there was one person, and I remember sitting in the meeting, who said, 'no, I'm going to bring out the best in Joe, I believe he has a talent, has further to go and has more to offer', and that was Lee Johnson.</p>
      <p>"If it hadn't been for Lee, I'm not so sure Joe would still be here. Lee and his coaching staff have showed a huge belief in him.</p>
      <p>"We've worked with him inside the club, he's been out on loan.</p>
      <p>"That moment when he lined up for Wales against Hungary this week was very special for him but also a testament to a lot of people in this football club who work tirelessly in developing young talent."</p>
      <p>Morrell was out of contract in 2021 and there was concern that his eye-catching performances for Lincoln and growing desire to be a first-team regular could lead him to seek a move away from BS3.</p>
      <p>But by safeguarding both his future and, in effect, their investment - should they chose to sell - it has cemented an impressive group of young midfielders at the club.</p>
      <p>Morrell, captain Josh Brownhill, Callum O’Dowda, Han-Noah Massengo, Tyreeq Bakinson, Adam Nagy, Niclas Eliasson and Liam Walsh are all 24 years old or younger (although the latter two names need their contract situations resolved), representing a bright present and future for the Robins.</p>
      <p>And that’s before mentioning those new names emerging through the academy or flourishing on loan: Sam Pearson, James Morton and Ayman Benarous being three prominent names.</p>
      <p>"It's part of our model, it's part of how we work. To have almost 10 players under 24 in that midfield position with the likes of Brownhill, Massengo, O'Dowda, Eliasson. And that's before you get to your James Mortons etc," Ashton added.</p>
      <p>"We're in a strong, healthy position but that's what we do, that's what we're about and again it's a huge testament to our coaching staff who develop these young players."</p>
