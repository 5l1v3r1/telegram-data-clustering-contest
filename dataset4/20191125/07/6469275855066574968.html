        <b>It was a dramatic weekend of Premier League action, as Manchester United came from behind to lead Sheffield United 3-2, before conceding a late Oliver McBurnie goal. Liverpool left it late again to beat Crystal Palace, whilst Manchester City edged out Chelsea 2-1.</b>

      <p>As the dust settles on the weekend's action, the rumour mill is back in full swing.</p>
      <p><a href="https://theathletic.com/1403402/2019/11/24/exclusive-jadon-sancho-feels-humiliated-and-scapegoated-by-dortmund-amid-interest-from-barcelona-liverpool-united-and-real/?redirected=1">The Athletic</a> report that Manchester United and Liverpool are battling to land England star Jadon Sancho, who reportedly feels 'humiliated' by Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old was substituted after 36 minutes in the 4-0 defeat to Bayern Munich recently, and has been criticised by his manager and other senior figures in the club.</p>
      <p>Barcelona and Real Madrid are also said to be interested in the tricky winger, but whoever lands Sancho may have to wait, as he reportedly prefers a summer move.</p>
