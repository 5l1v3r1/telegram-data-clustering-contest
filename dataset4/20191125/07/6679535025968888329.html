      <h1>Shops in Srinagar open after four days, movement of public transport increases</h1>
      <h2>The shops opened in the morning hours but ,downed their shutters around noon to join the protest against the abrogation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:52:48+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:52</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Most of the shops in Srinagar opened for a few hours on Monday and the movement of public transport also increased, officials said.</p>
      <p>Shops opened at several places across the city, including in the areas around the commercial hub of Lal Chowk here, and some places elsewhere in the valley, the officials said.</p>
      <p>They, however, said most of these shops downed their shutters around noon to join the protest against the <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/explained-how-the-status-of-jammu-and-kashmir-is-being-changed/article28822866.ece">abrogation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.</a></p>
      <p>The public transport increased on Monday as intra-district as well as inter-district cabs, auto-rickshaws and mini buses plied, the officials said. There was increased movement of private cars, leading to traffic jams at several places in the city, they added.</p>
      <p>While there was a semblance of normalcy in the Kashmir Valley over the past few weeks after about <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/shutdown-in-kashmir-as-two-uts-come-into-existence/article29840342.ece">three months of protest shutdown over the abrogation of Article 370 provisions</a>, the fresh shutdown started last Wednesday as threatening posters warning shopkeepers and public transport operators appeared at some places in the city here and elsewhere.</p>

      <p>Police said they have taken note of these incidents and several such modules have been busted by arresting several people.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, pre-paid mobile phones and all internet services continued to remain suspended since August 5 when the Centre announced the decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution and to bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir into Union territories. Most of the top-level and second-rung separatist politicians have been taken into preventive custody while mainstream leaders including two former chief ministers — <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/omar-abdullah-mehbooba-mufti-placed-under-house-arrest-section-144-imposed-in-srinagar/article28816384.ece">Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti</a> — have been either detained or placed under house arrest.</p>
      <p>The government has detained former Chief Minister and sitting Lok Sabha MP from Srinagar<a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/national-conference-chief-farooq-abdullah-confined-to-one-room/article29433308.ece"> Farooq Abdullah </a>under the controversial Public Safety Act, a law enacted by his father and National Conference founder Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah in 1978 when he was the Chief Minister.</p>
