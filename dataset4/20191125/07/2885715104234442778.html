      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:40:03+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Veteran actor <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/rishi-kapoor/">Rishi Kapoor</a> says he has reached a stage where the length of his character in a film doesn’t matter to him but he would no longer choose insignificant roles, such as the father of the leads.</p>
      <p>The actor, whose recent filmography boasts of movies such as Mulk and Kapoor &amp; Sons, said he now looks for parts that have an impact on the storyline.</p>
      <p>“I really love my work and I am passionate about it. The length of a role is not important but I don’t want to play an insignificant role, like the father of the hero or heroine in a film. I did those earlier. But there’s a learning process,” Kapoor told PTI.</p>
      <p>“Now I want to do roles which contribute to the story. There will be a saleable hero in the film and after that if there’s any character which is important to the film and story, only then I’d do it,” he added.</p>
      <p>Kapoor will be completing 50 years in movies next year with the golden jubilee of 1970 film Mera Naam Joker, his screen debut.</p>
      <p>However, the 67-year-old actor doesn’t believe in working “round the clock like a machine” and said healthy breaks in between are a must for every artiste.</p>
      <p>“If you give me a holiday, I’ll be happy for a month without a job. You need to detach from work, you need to be fresh. You need that break. You’re not a machine which can work around the clock. Everywhere in the world actors don’t work 365 days.”</p>
      <p>Kapoor recalled how there was a time when actors like <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/mithun-chakraborty/">Mithun Chakraborty</a> and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/govinda/">Govinda</a> would work four-six shifts.</p>
      <p>“Their films would also be such, like a conveyer belt. Print-deliver-print-deliver. Films aren’t made like this. It’s a creative, sensitive job. Filmmaking is something for people to enjoy.</p>
      <p>“I never took my work for granted or got a trick for a conveyer belt-type of filmmaking, churning out movies back-to-back like biscuits being produced,” he added.</p>
      <p>He will next be seen in Jeethu Joseph’s The Body. The Hindi remake of the Spanish film of the same name, “The Body” is scheduled to be released on December 13.</p>
