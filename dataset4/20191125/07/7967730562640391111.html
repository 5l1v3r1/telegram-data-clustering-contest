      <h1>'Serious misjudgment': policeman fined for giving friend intelligence</h1>

      <p>A NSW highway patrol officer has been convicted and fined $3080 after he met a long-term friend at a cafe this year and gave him restricted information from the police computer system, in an interaction witnessed by an undercover operative.</p>
      <p>Phillip Edward Parker, 53, told his friend of 30 years that Strike Force Raptor – a police taskforce targeting bikies and criminal activity – had written two intelligence reports about him in police database COPS.</p>

      <p>Parker told his friend the dates the reports were put into the system and said they concerned his friend's presence at an incident, as well as information about a stolen tow truck from 2008.</p>
      <p>The details were divulged after a police officer pulled the friend over on April 8, 2019 and said to him: "Have you been in trouble before ... a couple of intels are coming up on you".</p>
      <p>"I said 'excuse me?'" the friend told Parker, in a call intercepted by police. "He goes 'yeah'. I said 'f---ing hell, I don't know what intels are coming up on me. Mate, I've done nothing."</p>
      <p>Parker asked for the registration number of his friend's tow truck. Later that day, the friend asked if he'd had time to look into it.</p>

      <p>"Nah I haven't had time yet," Parker responded.</p>
      <p>"I can't believe he said that," the man said. "I just played the tape back. He clearly said it. That blew me away, f---. Unless he was bluffing, but you can't say shit like that. Like it's f---ing upset me."</p>
      <p>The next morning, Parker met the friend at a cafe at Penshurst in Sydney's south, bringing with him his police "Mobipol" data terminal.</p>
      <p>According to agreed facts, "an undercover operative in the cafe" overheard Parker relay information from the police system to the man. The man then said he would speak to his solicitor and make an application to access the intelligence reports.</p>
      <p>"The offender then put the Mobipol device away before the two left the cafe," the facts said.</p>
      <p>Parker also searched for his friend's name and number plate on the police COPS system in July 2018.</p>
      <p>He pleaded guilty in September to two counts of accessing/modifying restricted data held in a computer and one count of a public official unlawfully disclosing information.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Deputy Chief Magistrate Michael Allen said Parker acted on his friend's "express and implied" requests and made a "serious misjudgment". He said the actions could impact on the community's "somewhat fragile confidence in the administration of justice".</p>
      <p>"His conduct is a significant breach of trust to both the police and the community," Magistrate Allen said. "It is not, however, of the nature that calls for a term of imprisonment, as has been urged upon me by the Crown."</p>
      <p>Magistrate Allen said Parker, who is unlikely to reoffend, has been suspended without pay since his guilty plea and will in all probability lose his employment.</p>
      <p>"This mistake, I envisage, will have a profound, lifelong, lasting impact on him," Magistrate Allen said.</p>
      <p>He convicted Parker, fined him $3080 and gave him an 18-month community corrections order.</p>
      <p>The court was told Parker, who joined NSW Police in 2003, has been involved in community-based road safety activities including presenting traffic offender seminars since 2008.</p>
      <p>Parker is also a firefighter who has attended "literally countless fires and emergency situations" and has acted as the driver for a hospital rehabilitation service, Magistrate Allen said.</p>
