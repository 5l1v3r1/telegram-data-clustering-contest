      <h1>Thunder refuse to give up on finals dream as last-chance saloon looms</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:52:35+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:52</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Keoghan</a></address>
      <p>The Sydney Thunder are gearing up for a last throw of the dice as they attempt to snap a run of six consecutive defeats and keep their slim hopes of making the finals alive.</p>
      <p>In order for the Thunder to reach the semi-finals, they must win their final two games, starting with Melbourne Stars in Canberra on Wednesday, the Sixers must lose their last two and the Renegades must lose two of their final three matches.</p>

      <p>Despite a season of "ups and downs", 17-year-old Hannah Darlington said the Thunder's spirit has not wavered. "We've been in a lot of difficult situations in a few difficult games," she said.</p>
      <p>"I thought at the start of the season that morale would stay the same whether we were winning games or losing and that has certainly been the case... you wouldn't know we were losing games."</p>

      <p>On Sunday, the Thunder lost to the Strikers for the second time a week in agonising fashion after the first tie-breaking super over of the season. "It is heartbreaking, the number of games we have come close to winning," Darlington said.</p>
      <p>Darlington also said the younger players on the squad had been hit hardest by the losses, with leaders of the team stepping in to ensure the energy continues through to the end of the season.</p>
      <p>"Rachel [Haynes] and Fezzy [Rene Farrell] have been really supportive, and supporting us through a tough situation," she said. "Some of the girls have come from the top of their age division, and have never lost a string of games, so it's a new feeling for a lot of us, and they're keeping us level-headed."</p>
      <p>Darlington said the Thunder's batters have held their hands up and admitted a string of low totals have heaped too much pressure on the bowling attack.</p>
      <p>"It is hard to sit back and watch your efforts slip away," the promising all-rounder said.</p>
      <p>Rising star Phoebe Litchfield, 16, who was the youngest player- male or female - to score a BBL half-century in her second game with the Thunder, also said she was keen to end the season "on a positive note".</p>
      <p>You get disappointments, as you can see we've had a great start to the tournament but the last few have been challenging," she said. "Hopefully we can win a few games and make the semis. That would be amazing and obviously the end goal is winning it."</p>
      <p>The Thunder face the Melbourne Stars on Wednesday at Manuka Oval in Canberra, before their final season match on Sunday against the Renegades in St Kilda.</p>
