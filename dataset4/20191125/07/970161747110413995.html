      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here! contestant <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-haskell/">James Haskell</a> was a little antsy after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/im-celebrity-fans-demand-justice-james-haskell-roman-kemp-impossible-bushtucker-trial-11212111/">undertaking an ‘impossible’ Bushtucker Trial</a> with Roman Kemp and snapped at Ant and Dec.</p>
      <p>In scenes that aired last night, the former rugby player and the radio presenter<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/im-celebrity-merged-love-island-not-sure-feel-11212117/"> attempted a Love Island-themed task</a> to win themselves a roast dinner, however, it all proved to be a bit too difficult with audiences demanding justice for the duo.</p>
      <p>James and Roman had to unscrew stars from one side of a bed and re-screw them on the other side with just 90 seconds to get all three moved over.</p>
      <p>Oh, and if that wasn’t enough, they also had snakes lying beside them and each star was in a box filled with critters, including a snappy crab which caused problems for James.</p>

      <p>After the buzzer sounded, James seemed to be irritated by his defeat, causing Dec to ask: ‘That was unlucky. What was it, James?’</p>
      <p>‘Well, what was it?’ James replied. ‘Maybe the fact there was a giant crab in the way which you wanted me to carefully caress in a different direction while I was trying to undo a star in his face.’</p>

      <p>‘Alright, somebody’s getting a bit prickly!’ Dec gasped, making eyes at Ant.</p>
      <p>James laughed: ‘Competitive spirit!</p>
      <p>‘It was difficult and the crab wouldn’t get out the way and you had to unscrew it at the top. The cockroaches were a little bit easier but getting it back down with those crabs…’</p>

      <p>Viewers slammed the trial, with one writing to Ant and Dec on Twitter that there was ‘no way anyone on earth could have completed’ the challenge in 90 seconds.</p>
      <p>But the presenters clapped back and claimed ‘the stand-ins did it’ when it was tested before celebrities had their turn.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere on the episode, Caitlyn Jenner <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/im-celebrity-merged-love-island-not-sure-feel-11212117/">opened up about her transition and called her iconic Vanity Fair cover a ‘big f*** you to haters’</a> in conversation with Jacqueline Jossa and Nadine Coyle.</p>
      <p>‘For me, this was a big FU to the millions and millions of people out there that had said terrible things about me,’ she said. ‘And it just came out and it just shocked them.’</p>
      <p>Jacqueline later said in the bush telegraph: ‘I love the fact that she talks so openly and she feels like she can trust us and speak to us so openly and she puts everything into perspective as well.’</p>
