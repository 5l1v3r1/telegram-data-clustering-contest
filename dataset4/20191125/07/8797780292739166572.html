      <p>The year may be almost over, but after a tsunami of high profile releases December seems to have a few gems tucked away within itself. One of those games by the look of things is Darksiders Genesis, which looks set to tie up the original story of Darksiders with a nice pretty bow. At first glance, it’s Diablo with a hefty chunk of hack ‘n slash, some Zelda dungeoneering thrown in for good measure and the debut of Strife as a playable member of the my little Horseman of the apocalypse club. Aces.</p>
      <p>It’ll be out on pretty much every platform under the sun, but its PC gamers who’ll get a chance to flex Stryfe’s mighty sidearms in combat first, as the console versions of Darksiders Genesis will arrive in February 2020. So how much PC do you need to run the game? Surprisingly not much! Developer Gunfire Games have dropped the specs needed to run the game at its bare minimum and ultimate sexiness with all the settings turned up to max. See how your rig measures up:</p>
