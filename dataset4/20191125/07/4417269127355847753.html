      <p>A scooter stolen from Veary Road in Warner Beach on Thursday, 21 December was recovered on the same day by the CCPO. “Camera footage showed us who the culprits were and after getting the footage from the Warners Crime Group, it led us to a residence in Malugazi, near Isipingo,” said CCPO committee member, George Snodey.</p>
      <p>Accompanied by ET Rapid Response officers, who had already called SAPS and Metro Police K9 unit for back-up, the scooter was found hidden behind other vehicles. The vehicle used in the theft was also parked on the property. One suspect was detained for questioning and the scooter taken to Toti SAPS.</p>
