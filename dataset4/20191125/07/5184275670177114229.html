      <p>Talking about the picture, one gets to see Chiranjeevi seated posing for the picture with all smiles. While one gets to see Mohanlal with his hands lovingly placed on the shoulders of Chiranjeevi.</p>
      <p>The picture was captured at Chiranjeevi’s residence in Hyderabad where the <i>Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy</i> star hosted for actors from South Film Industry from the ’80s.</p>
      <p>Talking about their films, Mohanlal who was last seen on big screens in Tamil action venture <i>Kaapapan</i> alongside Kollywood superstar Suriya is currently all busy with his next, filmmaker Siddique’s Big Brother. The shoot for the film is in its final leg and the action venture will release in January 2020.</p>
      <p>Chiranjeevi will soon kickstart his next which has been tentatively titled Chiru 152. The action drama will be helmed by filmmaker Kortala Siva, and will be jointly bankrolled by Ram Charan’s Konidela Production Company and Matinee productions.</p>
      <p>The film was launched on the auspicious occasion of Dusshera last month.</p>
      <p>Chiru 152 is expected to go on floors in the month of December.</p>
      <p>If everything falls in place after Chiru 152 Chiranjeevi will start his next in which he will reprise Mohanlal’s role in Telugu remake of latter’s superhit Malayalam film Lucifer</p>
