      <p>A 25-year-old man was held with Rs 4.85-lakh worth ecstasy tablets in Malad West on Friday. The Anti Narcotics Cell (ANC) of the Mumbai Police Crime Branch said the accused, Utkarsh Patange, was caught peddling drugs outside Inorbit Mall. The police seized 97 purple ecstasy tablets from Patange’s possession.</p>
      <p>According to an ANC official, Patange peddled synthetic drugs near malls and educational institutions. He allegedly had ordered the ecstasy tablets from the dark web, a virtually untraceable way to procure drugs.</p>
      <p>He was produced in court Saturday and remanded to police custody until November 27, police said. Shivdeep Lande, Deputy Commissioner of Police, ANC, said purple ecstasy tablets, which are popular party drugs, were found to be sold outside colleges and malls across Mumbai’s suburbs.</p>
