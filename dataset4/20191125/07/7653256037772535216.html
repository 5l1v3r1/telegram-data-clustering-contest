      <p>MUMBAI: Amid the high political drama in Maharashtra and fear of 'poaching' of MLAs, the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/NCP">NCP</a> has shifted its legislators from a five-star resort to two other hotels in the city.</p>
      <p>According to sources, the NCP MLAs, who were staying at Hotel <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Renaissance">Renaissance</a> in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Powai">Powai</a> area, have been moved to Hotel Grand Hyatt in Santacruz and Sofitel in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC).</p>
      <p>Incidentally, BJP leader Ravindra Chavan was on Sunday seen entering Hotel Renaissance.</p>
      <p>The Congress legislators are still in J W Marriott hotel in suburban Andheri, the sources said.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Shiv-Sena">Shiv Sena</a> MLAs are currently staying at The Lalit hotel, located near the international airport in Andheri, but they may be shifted to another resort, the sources added.</p>
      <p>Senior Congress leader <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ashok-Chavan">Ashok Chavan</a> on Sunday alleged that BJP leaders had booked rooms in a hotel where his party MLAs were put up and were contacting some of them.</p>
      <p>The BJP made a return to power in a dramatic way early Saturday morning after NCP leader Ajit Pawar joined hands with the saffron party, leading to Governor <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Bhagat-Singh-Koshyari">Bhagat Singh Koshyari</a> swearing in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Devendra-Fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis</a> as chief minister and Pawar as his deputy.</p>
      <p>Given the political scenario in the state, the role of MLAs has become far more crucial during the floor test in the 288-member House where the halfway mark is 145.</p>
      <p>In the last month's Assembly polls, the BJP won 105 seats, the Shiv Sena 56, the NCP 54 and the Congress 44.</p>
      <p>According to sources, Independent legislators and other MLAs could tilt the scales in favour of either the BJP- led government of Fadnavis backed by Ajit Pawar or the Sena- Congress-NCP combine during the floor test.</p>
