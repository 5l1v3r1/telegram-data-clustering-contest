      <h1>Lamborghini Lambo V12 Vision Gran Turismo Is Absolutely Wild</h1>
      <h2>Calling all gamers.</h2>

      <p>Whenever Lamborghini reveals a new concept car, it's guaranteed to be over the top. Today's reveal is no different. Introducing the Lambo V12 Vision Gran Turismo, an all-new concept the Italian automaker emphasizes is "'fun to drive' within the digital environment of the iconic racing game Gran Turismo Sport for Sony PlayStation 4."</p>
      <p>It will be virtually available beginning this spring. Lamborghini revealed the concept in the flesh at the 2019 World finals of the FIA-Certified Gran /Turismo Championship in Monte Carlo.</p>
      <p>Designed by Lamborghini's Centro Stile design center in Sant'Agata, this single-seater is powered by the same powertrain found in the limited edition <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/lamborghini/sian">Lamborghini Sian</a>, meaning it features a naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12 paired to a 48-volt mild-hybrid system for a total output of 819 horsepower. The Sian, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/meet-lamborghinis-insane-sian-up-close-and-personal">Lamborghini's first hybrid</a>, makes the sprint from 0 to 60 mph in only 2.8 seconds and has an electronically controlled top speed of 217 mph.</p>

      <p>Lamborghini further says that the concept's design expands the potential of its design language in a very futuristic way. Despite being a single-seater, the Lambo V12 Vision GT retains the iconic brand silhouette. And because of its racing nature, no passenger is necessary. Aerodynamics also played a major role in the overall design. For example, there's the large rear wing that houses a Y-taillight. This same Y-signature is found in the headlights as well. The body's elements were designed as high-performance surfaces that integrate both dramatic design and aerodynamics.</p>
      <p>Unlike road-going Lamborghinis, the concept's body is disconnected from the fenders. In a nod to the 1968 Lamborghini Marzal, the side windows feature a hexagon-inspired theme. Keeping up with Lamborghini's jet-fighter design approach, the driver enters the cabin just like a fighter pilot does - from the front of the car. All main driving controls are located on the steering wheel while all vital driver information is projected virtually in front of them.</p>

      <p>"The Lambo V12 Vision Gran Turismo is created to provide the ultimate virtual car for young fans and gamers, who are ultra-enthusiastic about Lamborghini and its futuristic aspirations," said Mitja Borkert, Head of Lamborghini Centro Stile. "It is an opportunity for the design talent within Lamborghini to stretch its wings and visualize a car that, like every Lamborghini, is a head-turner and the best driving experience, but also mirrors Lamborghini's push on future technologies, particularly in the arena of lightweight materials and hybridization."</p>
      <p>But the big question remaining is how does it drive, dynamically speaking? We'll just have to wait until it debuts on Gran Turismo Sport next year.</p>
