      <p>Homes with out-of-the-ordinary features can also qualify as luxurious. The features can be eco-friendly such as solar panels, sustainable and locally-sourced materials to those that contribute to the overall presence of homes, for example, uniquely designed gardens.</p>
      <p>Luxury homes depict the lifestyles of their owners. Luxury homes promote certain modes of living. Though a house, for most people,  have an emotional attachment, to   the millennials it is to flaunt their arrivat into the super-rich club. So they more often not  attached to any home as they ready to move out once a new talk-of-the-town super-highbrow residential area comes on stream. They only want to be identified with the ‘happening’ places in town hence no attachments whatsoever to anything.</p>
      <p>An Estate Surveyor &amp; Valuer and Principal Partner , Sola Enitan and Co, Mr. Sola Enitan, said there is growing market for super luxury apartments, driven by the influx of foreigners and the growing young millenials  at the top of  what he called ‘money hierarchy’. He said though those in this bracket are not many, they are willing to pay any price to assuage their fancy in residential apartments.</p>
      <p>According to him, the millenials are involved in e-commerce, Fintech, start-ups  and other high technology-based businesses.</p>
      <p>He said: “Some class of people want classic things and these are driving the luxury market for the millennials. Sometimes, they buy  to keep or live in, and are willing to pay the cost. It is not the run-of-the-mill estate investor that builds such apartments because those in the straight jacket real estate development are in recession because housing is at its low currently as a result of the current economic climate in the country”.</p>
