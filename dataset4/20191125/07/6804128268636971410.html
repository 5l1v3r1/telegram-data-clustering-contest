      <h1>Mount, Abraham, Pulisic - Latest Chelsea injury news and expected return dates ahead of Valencia</h1>
      <h2>The latest injury news for Chelsea as they travel to face Valencia in the Champions League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:31:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:31</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea's seven-match winning streak in the Premier League came to an end on Saturday, as they were beaten 2-1 at Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez sealed victory for the champions, despite N'Golo Kante's early effort for the Blues.</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard's side travel to Valencia next up, as they look to earn a crucial three points in the quest to reach the last-16 of the Champions League.</p>
      <p>But, to have the best chance of doing that, Lampard will need as many players as possible available.</p>
      <p>So, here's a look at the latest news from the Cobham treatment room:</p>
      <h3>Christian Pulisic</h3>
      <p>Chelsea faced an anxious wait over the international break to discover the extent of Pulisic's hip injury that kept him out of international duty.</p>
      <p>However, the winger was passed fit and started against Manchester City - playing the full 90 minutes.</p>

      <p>His return will be a major boost to Chelsea ahead of a massive period of games as he has been in fine form for the Blues in the last month.</p>
      <h3>Callum Hudson-Odoi</h3>
      <p>While there was good news on Christian Pulisic, Callum Hudson-Odoi picked up a hamstring problem on international duty and missed the trip to the Etihad Stadium. The midfielder was substituted in the second half of England's game against Kosovo, but there was no reported injury at the time.</p>
      <p>"Callum Hudson-Odoi is probably the one who has a hamstring issue that he picked up in the England game he will struggle to be in contention for this game, but it's short term," said the Chelsea boss.</p>
      <p>The winger is likely to miss the trip to Spain and the clash against West Ham at the weekend, but could return for the Aston Villa game afterwards.</p>
      <h3>Antonio Rudiger</h3>
      <p>Antonio Rudiger had appeared to have given Frank Lampard a welcome injury boost by declaring himself fit for the Blues' trip to Watford last month, but it was ruled out as a miscommunication.</p>
      <p>The German centre back underwent knee surgery in the summer and has missed a good majority of the season, but looks set for a return in the next couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>"He had an operation and he is going to be out probably for three weeks, hopefully,"<a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/lampard-chelsea-press-conference-live-17218718">Lampard confirmed at his pre-Crystal Palace press conference</a>."</p>
      <p>Then we will have to see where match fitness comes in because he has been out for a long time now.</p>

      <p>"It was nice to get something definitive about it because we have been trying to find a solution and he has been having some issues. It is not easy for a player in that position. So hopefully we are at that stage and hopefully in three weeks time we are in a lot better place."</p>
      <p>Rudiger is not likely to face Valencia, but could be available towards the beginning of December.</p>
      <h3>Ross Barkley</h3>
      <p>Barkley has not featured since the 1-0 win against Newcastle United in October.</p>
      <p>He has been missing since after picking up an ankle injury in the victory, with Lampard confirming that Barkley wouldn't be fit enough to make the squad for the visit of Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>The England international was initially called up to Gareth Southgate's squad for the international fixtures against Montenegro and Kosovo over the international break.</p>

      <p>But, the midfielder was forced to pull out of the Three Lions squad prior to the first of two matches, due to the injury.</p>
      <p>Barkley missed the Manchester City clash, but could yet return for the Valencia trip.</p>

      <h3>Ruben Loftus-Cheek</h3>
      <p>Loftus-Cheek was establishing himself as a key member of Maurizio Sarri's squad at the end of last season.</p>
      <p>However, in the post-season friendly ahead of the Europa League final, Loftus-Cheek suffered the same injury as Hudson-Odoi as he ruptured his Achilles' tendon.</p>
      <p>The midfielder is still undergoing rehabilitation, with Loftus-Cheek working towards a return as soon as possible.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>"It’s going well!" he recently told <a href="https://versus.uk.com/2019/11/im-coming-back-stronger-ruben-loftus-cheek-ready-return-already-eyes-euro-2020/">Versus</a> when asked about his recovery from injury.</p>
      <p>"It’s been a long time and I’ve had a few setbacks as well. It’s never been just a straight path but I’m close now…I’ve been running and moving, I feel I’m right on the edge. I’m close and I can’t wait."</p>
      <p>However, Lampard has <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/players/rudiger-loftus-cheek-chelsea-injuries-17225279">warned it could still be a while yet before the midfielder</a> is available for selection.</p>
      <p>A conditional return date of mid December has been suggested by PremierInjuries, with a possible return coming in the Premier League clash against Bournemouth, however, Lampard has confirmed that there is no set date for the player's return.</p>

      <h3>Marco van Ginkel</h3>
      <p>The midfielder is a long term absentee, as he continues his rehabilitation following an anterior cruciate ligament injury.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman is on the way to recovery, having posted a video of himself working on the anti-gravity treadmill at the club's training ground.</p>

      <p>However, there is no return date provided for the 26-year-old as yet.</p>
      <p><b>Mason Mount</b> was named on the bench for the Manchester City clash, but this was a tactical decision from Frank Lampard and the midfielder came on for the last 17 minutes.</p>
      <p><b>Tammy Abraham </b>started the game against Manchester City and was withdrawn with 20 minutes to go, but this was a tactical swap from Lampard, potentially with the Valencia game in mind.</p>
