      <p>It is mostly based on those who gain five or more Highers.</p>
      <p>That receives a double-weighted score with rankings also affected by the number of pupils who get more than two Advanced Highers or five or more National 5s.</p>
      <p>Figures were published in <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/best-uk-schools-guide-parent-power-tr95xdztg">The Sunday Times</a>' Parent Power rankings today.</p>
      <p>It saw Jordanhill School in Glasgow hold on to top spot from last year.</p>
      <p>The west end secondary was a clear leader with 83 per cent of pupils getting five or more awards at SCQF Level 6, the equivalent of Highers.</p>
      <p>Stirlingshire's Dunblane High sits in second - with 76 per cent hitting the five-Higher mark - having climbed from ninth last year.</p>

      <p>St Ninian's High in Glasgow's south side suburb of Giffnock making up the top three at 75 per cent.</p>
      <p>Edinburgh's only top 10 school is Boroughmuir High which sits at fourth with 71 per cent.</p>
      <p>The next two schools, East Renfrewshire's Mearns Castle and Williamwood, both had a greater percentage of pupils hitting the five-Higher mark, 75 and 73, respectively.</p>
      <p>But Boroughmuir's Advanced Higher rating of 33 per cent put it above the two Greater Glasgow schools, who both ranked 24.</p>
      <p>Gryffe High in Houston, Renfrewshire, climbed nine places to eighth with a Higher ranking of 70 per cent.</p>
      <p>Glasgow's suburbs made up the rest of the top 10 with East Dunbartonshire schools Bearsden Academy in 7th (70 per cent), Douglas Academy of Milngavie in 9th (69 per cent) and Bishopbriggs Academy in 10th (66 per cent).</p>
      <p>One school unfortunate to miss out on the upper reaches of the table is the Glasgow Gaelic School.</p>
      <p>With 68 per cent of pupils hitting the five-Higher mark and 27 per cent getting two or more Advance Highers, it would have made the top 10.</p>
      <p>But the bilingual school is placed 93rd as there are no National 5 statistics.</p>
      <p>The statistics for individual schools were released by the Scottish government.</p>
      <p>The measure recognised that deprived pupils generally perform worse than affluent ones.</p>
