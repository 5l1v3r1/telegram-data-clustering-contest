        <i>We will try and focus on <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/smallcap">smallcap</a> and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/midcap">midcap</a> stocks in autos and financial services as these can generate significant alpha, says <b><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Naveen-Kulkarni">Naveen Kulkarni</a></b>, Head of Research, <b><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Reliance-Securities">Reliance Securities</a></b>. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Going forward, you continue to remain positive although you are expecting <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/markets">markets</a> to remain range-bound, given that divestment, earnings and global key events seem already factored in. What is the next big trigger?<br/></b>The next big trigger is clearly the sustenance of recovery. The festival season as such was reasonably good. If that recovery started from the festival season and sustained in the second half, the markets are more likely to do well. The visibility on that will be something like the auto numbers which is a high frequency indicator.</p>
      <p>These will be the key factors which the market will be very closely watching for the sustenance of the recovery. Second, the question over what happens on the global front if global scenario continues to remain constructive? If we have a trade deal by the end of the year or even early next year, that is going to be positive.</p>
      <p>Overall there is a positive construct but visibility on the recovery is going to be the most critical factor going ahead.</p>
      <p><b>Do you stick with some of the expensive stocks? Are you expanding your portfolio and are you willing to see a more risk-prone scenario?<br/></b>The volatility for the market has come down from what it was in the months of July, On the VIX, we are now at around 14-15 kind of a range. Once the volatility declines, it means more midcap and smallcaps will come under focus. I would suggest expanding the portfolio, adding more midcap and smallcap stocks.</p>
      <p>Whenever there is a higher level of beta with regards to the economic recovery, those are the areas that we will add. We will try and focus on smallcap and midcap stocks in autos and financial services as these can generate significant alpha.</p>
      <p><b>What is your take on some of the telecom names?<br/></b>Our take on telecom sector is based on what happens from the government in terms of the floor pricing and in what form and fashion, it actually comes out. The telecom sector is hinged on two factors; one, there will be some regulatory development in terms of floor pricing; and two, an aspect which the market tends to play more aggressively is that in a two- player market scenario of Jio and Bharti -- Bharti will benefit.</p>
      <p>So these are the two themes that the market is playing. We believe that a floor pricing is a very critical aspect of the telecom industry in the current scenario, where there has been a levy of AGR dues on the incumbent players. I believe if there is no floor pricing or if there is no major mechanism to get that tariffs up, we are likely to see that the incumbent stocks, even Bharti could correct from the current levels. In a scenario where there is a floor pricing, more players will benefit.</p>
      <p><b>Is there more money to be made in PSUs after the rally in anticipation of divestment that one has already seen or do you think the best is now way behind us?<br/></b>That is always a tricky play. When there is value, these stocks tend to rally. That is why three monthsâ€™ back, there was a lot more value in any of the PSU names. From that perspective, there is limited value. If I were to talk about something like <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/bharat-petroleum-corporation-ltd/stocks/companyid-11941.cms">BPCL</a>, I feel there is very limited value from the current levels.</p>
      <p>We have a reduce rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 424. From that perspective, there are challenges, but there are good PSU names like a SBI which we discussed even the last time. That is more of a play on the economic recovery and the resolutions which are going to happen in the forthcoming quarters. It is something which we will be more interested in playing rather than the traditional divestment kind of plays.</p>
      <p><b>Let us also understand what the outlook is when it comes to some of the largecaps because we have been seeing a lot of focus on very select names that have been taking the lead or driving the market gains. What are you looking at for value picking within the largecap universe as well as the broader markets?<br/></b>From a value picking perspective, let us look at a stock like say Maruti. For Maruti, the clear factor will be the monthly numbers as that will sustain the valuations and the possible up move in the forthcoming quarters.</p>
      <p>For the whole auto pack, it is going to be that kind of a structural shift in the numbers which the market will be very closely looking at because the channel inventory has come down.</p>
      <p>In case of banks, resolutions are going to be the critical factor that is point number one. Second is, if there is a pickup in the credit growth activity going ahead, if they are gaining market share at the cost of NBFCs and things like that, it is another factor for the banks.</p>
      <p>In case if IT, we will have to wait more in terms of what happens in the forthcoming quarters because Q3 tends to be weaker for the IT sector. The largecap names are very close to topping out. There are some challenges in terms of valuations for the major large cap names. So, visibility and operating performance will be the most critical factor for sustenance of valuations and possible rerating from the current levels.</p>
      <p><b>What is your stand on the media space? Do you think OTT platforms are going to drive away viewership from the traditional media channels?<br/></b>That is a very, very long term trend. India is still a market where the television reach is going to be a very critical factor. From that perspective, if we look at what has happened with Zee, we can see a major resolution. So from that perspective, the stock has rerated. The biggest overhang on the stock is out and Sun is trading much cheaper compared to Zee.</p>
      <p>I think that makes a case to look at Sun at this point in time, considering the strong business profile that the company continues to enjoy. From the perspective of whether the traditional media companies can do better from the current levels or not, I believe there is a healthy chance of that happening but over a longer period. If you ask me whether these stocks can rerate from the current levels, that will be a challenge because of the construct of the business and the structural challenges that the business faces.</p>
      <p>But in the medium term, there is the possibility of earnings growth improvement and some bit of rerating and what we have seen is a very likely possibility in the short or in the medium term.</p>
