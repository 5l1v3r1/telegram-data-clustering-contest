      <p>DCB Bank on Monday said it has a non-funded exposure of Rs 30 crores in the form of bank guarantees issued on behalf of Karvy Stock Broking Ltd.</p>
      <p>The private sector bank informed the exchanged that the bank guarantees are secured by 50 per cent cash margin in the form of term deposits.</p>
      <p>An ex-parte SEBI order passed on Friday evening, which partially restricted Karvy from taking on new clients. SEBI cited a report by the National Stock Exchange (NSE) which pointed out that Karvy had pledged clients’ shares and even sold a huge amount of them without their consent.</p>
