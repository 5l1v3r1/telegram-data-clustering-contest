          <p>VAR was introduced to remove contentious elements from the game and bring in clarity in terms of decision making. In reality however, it has proved to be quite the opposite. VAR has proven to be a bone of contention in almost every match this season.</p>

                <p>Most teams have felt that they’ve been wronged by the decisions taken by VAR. In fact, Mike Riley, the head of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), recently admitted that there have been four occasions this season where VAR has incorrectly overturned a correct decision made by the referee.</p>
                <p>In all of this though, most Non-Liverpool fans have made an interesting claim suggesting that the only reason Liverpool lead the league at the moment is because of VAR. The controversy at Selhurst Park, where Jurgen Klopp’s side benefitted from VAR to register a 2-1 victory only added more fuel to the outrage.</p>

                      <p>Former Arsenal player, Paul Meson even went on to say, <i>“Shall we give Liverpool the league now?”</i> on Sky Sports’ Soccer Saturday. However, one Liverpool fan has taken offence to the claim and has made a twitter thread to prove that Liverpool have suffered just as much as the other sides.</p>
                      <p>He has cited incidents such as the foul on DIvock Origi vs Manchester United which was soon followed by Marcus Rashford scoring the opener. Roberto Firmino’s disallowed goal vs Aston Villa at the start of November also makes the list.</p>

                            <p>The tweet has since been retweeted more than 1000 times. Definitely a sign of Liverpool fans having had enough of it. Will it silence critics from Rival clubs though? Probably not.</p>
