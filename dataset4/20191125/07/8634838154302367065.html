        <b>There was panic after a light aircraft crash-landed moments after taking off on Sunday, November 25 at Nyaribo Airstrip in Mweiga area of Nyeri County.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to a report by the <i>Daily Nation,</i> the aircraft was being flown by a trainee pilot who is a student at a local aviation group.</p>
      <p>No casualties were reported in the Sunday incident that came with a backdrop of increasing concern over safety in the Kenyan aviation industry following <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/KCAA%20Swings%20Into%20Action%20After%20Silverstone%20Air%20Accidents%20">a number of mishaps involving local airlines</a>. </p>

      <p>Photos from the scene of the accident seen by <a href="http://kenyans.co.ke/"><i>Kenyans.co.ke</i></a>, show the aircraft under registration number 5Y-BZK flipped over on the grass right next to the runway.</p>
      <p>By the time of going to press, the cause of the accident had not yet established.</p>
      <p>On February 28, 2018, another aircraft with three family members on board crash-landed at the same airstrip.</p>
      <p>Among them were former Nyeri Town MP Esther Murugi and her son who was the pilot. The two escaped unhurt while her daughter-in-law suffered minor injuries. </p>
      <p>Shortly after take-off, the aircraft hit the fence surrounding the airstrip and landed in a nearby bush.</p>
      <p>"We thank God that we are fine, we had a good pilot. If it were me I would have panicked. He was very calm," Murugi stated. </p>
