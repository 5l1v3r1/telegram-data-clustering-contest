      <h2>Ally McCoist says Mauricio Pochettino should take charge of Arsenal rather than Man United</h2>

      <h3>Mauricio Pochettino should manage Arsenal ahead of Manchester United, according to Ally McCoist.</h3>
      <p>The Argentine head coach is looking for new employers after Tottenham Hotspur surprisingly parted company with Pochettino last week.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old led Tottenham to four successive top-four finishes and a Champions League final during his five seasons in charge at the north London side.</p>
      <p>However, Pochettino paid the price for a disappointing start to the Premier League season as Spurs appointed Jose Mourinho as his replacement.</p>
      <p>Arsenal boss Unai Emery is coming under pressure following the Gunners’ five-game winless run in the Premier League, while Manchester United have been regularly linked with Pochettino since David Moyes’ axing in 2014.</p>
      <p>Former Scotland striker McCoist explained why Pochettino should snub Manchester United in favour of taking over the reins at Arsenal if the opportunity arises.</p>
      <p>Asked whether Pochettino would be better suited to Arsenal than Manchester United, McCoist told <i>Sky Sports’ The Debate</i>: “Yeah, I think so.</p>
      <p>“I definitely think [a young team will be better for Pochettino]. If you’re asking me, I think he’d suit Arsenal’s squad more than he’d suit Manchester United’s squad.</p>
      <p>“There are a group of players at Arsenal he could work with immediately. Manchester United is a far bigger job, by that I mean longer term, more of a rebuild.</p>
      <p>“I think there are, at this moment in time, probably more players to work with at Arsenal. Manchester United fans might not agree with that.</p>
      <p>“I do think Emery is vulnerable. I think he’s probably the most vulnerable [manager in the Premier League].”</p>
      <p>Arsenal drew 2-2 with relegation candidates Southampton on Saturday after Alexandre Lacazette netted a late equaliser for the home side.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are already nine points behind fourth-placed Chelsea FC in the race to secure a Champions League spot this term.</p>
      <p>Emery took over the reins from Arsenal from Arsene Wenger in 2018 following his successful stint in charge of Paris Saint-Germain.</p>
      <p>Arsenal haven’t won the Premier League title since 2004.</p>
