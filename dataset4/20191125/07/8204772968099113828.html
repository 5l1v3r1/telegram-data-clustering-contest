      <p>An Irishwoman killed in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Australia">Australia</a> back in 1997 ignored a warning not to accept a lift from a stranger the night she was murdered, a <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Western+Australia">Western Australia</a> court has heard.</p>
      <p>One of Australia’s biggest-ever murder trials began in a <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Western+Australia+Supreme+Court">Western Australia Supreme Court</a> on Monday, with Bradley <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Robert+Edwards">Robert Edwards</a> accused of the murder of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Ciara+Glennon">Ciara Glennon</a> (27) from the upmarket suburb of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Claremont">Claremont</a> on March 14th, 1997.</p>
      <p>Ms Glennon, who family are originally from Wesport in Co Mayo, was out with friends celebrating St Patrick’s Day when she disappeared.</p>
      <p>In her opening address to the court, State Prosecutor <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Carmel+Barbagallo">Carmel Barbagallo</a> outlined in detail the last day of Ms Glennon’s life before her body was dumped in bushland, 50 kilometres north of Perth.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Ms+Barbagallo">Ms Barbagallo</a> went through 12 instances where witnesses claim they saw a lone woman matching Ciara’s description walking near the Continental Hotel after she left to catch a taxi.</p>
      <p>Three men, who the state has dubbed the “Burger Boys”, were the last to see Ms Glennon as she walked towards her home in Mosman Park.</p>
      <p>One of the men who spotted Ms Glennon walking down, yelled to her, “you’re crazy to hitch-hike”.</p>
      <p>It was the last known sighting of Ms Glennon.</p>
