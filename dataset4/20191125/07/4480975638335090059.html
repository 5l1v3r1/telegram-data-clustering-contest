      <h3>Key Quotes</h3>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/us-dollar-indexeurusd"><b>EUR/USD</b></a> is slipping back to the 1.0989 mid-November low. Whilst it holds, last week’s high at 1.1097 may be revisited, a rise above which would have the 1.1180 October high in its sights. Above 1.1180 will target the 200 week ma at 1.1359”.</p>
      <p>“Below 1.0989 lies the 1.0943 78.6% retracement”.</p>
