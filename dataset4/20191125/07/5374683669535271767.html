      <p>A professor at Syracuse University was threatened by an anonymous email containing anti-Semitic language and Holocaust references.</p>
      <p>The email sent on Tuesday morning to Genevieve García de Müeller, a professor of writing, rhetoric and composition, the campus student newspaper, <i>The Daily Orange,</i> reported.</p>
      <p>The subject line of the email was “JEW.” It told her to “get in the oven where you belong” and ended with an anti-Semitic slur, according to the newspaper, which did not disclose the slur.</p>
      <p>Mueller is Jewish and Mexican.</p>
      <p>“Immediately, I thought of the safety of my family,” Müeller told the newspaper. “I don’t know who would’ve sent it. I don’t know who knows I’m Jewish. It’s not something I talk about in class necessarily, but it was very personal to me.”</p>
      <p>She said she tweeted a screenshot of the email to the Syracuse Police Department.</p>
      <p>A day later, a white supremacist manifesto was air-dropped to students’ cellphones at Syracuse’s Bird Library.</p>
      <p>It is the 16 racist or bias-related incident reported on or near the campus since Nov. 7, according to <i>The Daily Orange</i>. Most of the incidents are against black and Asian people</p>
      <p>A week ago, the university cancelled all fraternity activities for the rest of this semester after racist activities were reported.</p>
