      <p>Fans of I'm A Celebrity are outraged after the live trial, claiming it had been made impossible on purpose to create divisions in the camp.</p>
      <p>The trial, based on another of ITV's reality smashes Love Island, saw the celebrities take on a number of challenges, which included downing blended vomit fruit and finding a star in a pot of mealworms using only the mouth, to win a roast dinner for each of the contestants.</p>
      <p>Earlier there had been tensions as they had to decide in which order they were going to get their meals.</p>
      <p>Former rugby player James Haskell and DJ Roman Kemp were the last two up for a challenge but they failed to win their stars, Ian Wright, Cliff Parisi and Andy Whyment would all have to make do with some rice.</p>
      <p>James and Roman had to reach into boxes filled with all sorts of critters and unscrew their stars - but they didn't get them in time.</p>
      <p>When Ant and Dec asked James what had gone wrong, he gave a very sassy reply: "The very fact that there was a giant crab in the way that you wanted me to carefully caress in a different direction while I was trying to unscrew a star in its face."</p>
      <p>Dec mocked: "Alright, somebody's getting a bit prickly!"</p>
      <p>"The competitive spirit!" James laughed.</p>
      <p>But fans of the show were not happy about the outcome saying it had been impossible from the start.</p>

      <p>Another said: "I think James didn't realise it was a countdown for the entire three stars, otherwise he probably would have tried to unscrew two stars at once from the get-go. Definitely unfair, and I think it was done on purpose to get a reaction out of Ian on rice and beans again next episode."</p>
      <p>Earlier in the challenges, Ian Wright had to take part in a pie challenge and nearly gagged on a milkshake of blended pigs penis.</p>
