      <h1>Checkers’ Sixty60 grocery delivery service debuts in Cape Town, Sandton</h1>

      <p>Checkers on Monday, and just in time for Black Friday, announced its on-demand grocery delivery service that promises to deliver within an hour.</p>
      <p>It’s powered by an app called Sixy60, through which users can order their food, track the status of their order, and follow the delivery in real time.</p>

      <p>Think of its as Uber Eats for your groceries, except products listed cost the same as the products in stores. Delivery is also free. For now.</p>
      <p>Checkers also only accepts card-based payments through Sixty60, so there’s no cash-on-delivery option available.</p>
      <p>“The name Sixty60 captures the service’s main ambition: for customers to order groceries in sixty seconds and have them delivered in as little as sixty minutes,” said Neil Schreuder, Checkers’ chief of innovation and strategy.</p>
      <p>While the app is still in its testing phase, it’s currently available to try out in limited areas across Sandton and Cape Town.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For Cape Town: Durbanville, Willowbridge, Okavango Crossing, Rondebosch, Kloof Street and Sea Point.</li>
        <li>For Sandton: Melrose and Bryanston.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The app can be downloaded from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=za.co.shoprite.sixty60&amp;gl=ZA">Google Play Store</a> for Android devices, and the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/za/app/sixty60/id1453556093">Apple App Store</a> for iPhones.</p>
