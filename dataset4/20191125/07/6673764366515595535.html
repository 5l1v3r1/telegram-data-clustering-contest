      <p><b>FUKUOKA – </b>A day after claiming his 43rd career title with a win at the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament, yokozuna Hakuho said he intends to fight on in pursuit of his 50th championship.</p>
      <p>While the 34-year-old has already said he plans to continue wrestling until next summer’s Tokyo Olympics, he revealed an even bigger ambition at a news conference in Fukuoka on Monday.</p>
      <p>“I’m not sure (when I can accomplish it), it may be two years or three years from now,” said Hakuho, who holds the all-time record for the most titles in sumo’s top makuuchi division.</p>
      <p>Hakuho, who was promoted to the sport’s highest rank in 2007, secured his latest championship with a win over sekiwake Mitakeumi on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Mongolian-born wrestler beat ozeki Takakeisho on the final day to finish the 15-day meet at Fukuoka Kokusai Center with a 14-1 record.</p>
      <p>He said winning the Emperor’s Cup in the final tournament of the year was all the more special considering his recent battles with injuries.</p>
      <p>He skipped the May tournament in Tokyo to treat a muscle tear in his upper arm which he sustained in March. He also withdrew from the September tournament, his first basho since becoming a Japanese citizen, due to a fracture to his right little finger.</p>
      <p>“I suffered an injury on the final day (of the March tournament) and my doctor said I wouldn’t be able to completely recover. I thought I would never be able to accomplish (winning a championship) again,” he said.</p>
      <p>Hakuho’s only loss in Fukuoka was against top-ranked maegashira Daieisho on Day 2. The yokozuna bounced back with 13 straight convincing wins in a competition that was missing some of the sport’s highest-ranked wrestlers.</p>
      <p>“(Their absence) made me think that I need to keep myself together,” he said.</p>
      <p>Hakuho made his debut in the makuuchi division in May 2004, and became the sole owner of the all-time championship record when he won his 33rd Emperor’s Cup in January 2015.</p>
      <p>He is expected to compete at the New Year Grand Sumo Tournament, which opens on Jan. 12 at Tokyo’s Ryogoku Kokugikan.</p>
