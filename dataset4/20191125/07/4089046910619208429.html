      <p>Shawn Gazolas, 17, walked out to his car on what he thought was a typical Friday morning. His parents and 11-year-old sister Reina Gazolas were getting ready for work and school.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, a masked man approached Shawn Gazolas. He had his gun drawn and his laser sight flashing across the teenager’s chest.</p>
      <p>“I saw a dark figure and noticed he had a gun, so I put my hands up,” Shawn Gazolas said. “I just gave him the keys, and he jumped inside the car.”</p>
      <p>The teenager then ran inside, yelling for his father, John Gazolas, who made it outside to see the man drive away in the 2007 Toyota Camry.</p>
      <p>The suspect, described as a medium height Hispanic man with a stocky build, also took off with Shawn Gazolas’ backpack and canned goods he planned to bring to a food drive that day.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, no one was hurt during the incident.</p>
      <p>"I just love him [Shawn] so much, but thank God, nothing really happened. Thank God, he did the right thing,” said Reina, through tears.</p>
      <p>The family says they will be changing their locks and updating their alarms.</p>
      <p>"We thought it would be a safe place to raise our kids,” mother Elizabeth Gazolas said. “It just hurts me to see stuff like this, just trying to hurt innocent people.”</p>
