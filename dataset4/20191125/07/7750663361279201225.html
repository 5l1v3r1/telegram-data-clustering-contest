      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/mclaren/"><b>McLaren</b></a> is more than happy with its current driver lineup.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:58:42+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:58</time> by <a rel="author">GMM F1</a></address>
      <p>This year, despite <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/fernando-alonso/"><b>Fernando Alonso</b></a>'s departure, the British team has become 'best of the rest' behind the sport's top three outfits.</p>
      <p>Even <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/christian-horner/"><b>Christian Horner</b></a>, a top official at <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/red-bull/"><b>Red Bull</b></a> who released former junior driver <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/carlos-sainz/"><b>Carlos Sainz</b></a> to McLaren, is happy for the Spanish driver.</p>
      <p>"He has probably been the best midfield driver after the group of top team drivers," he told Speed Week.</p>
      <p>"We decided to go our separate ways, but we are still proud to have given him the chance to move up to Formula 1."</p>
      <p>New team boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andreas-seidl/"><b>Andreas Seidl</b></a> told the Spanish newspaper AS that McLaren is delighted to have scooped up Sainz's services.</p>
      <p>"It's difficult to judge from the outside the decisions a team makes, but the important thing for us is that he is part of our team," he said when asked about Sainz's former teams.</p>
      <p>"I am looking forward to many more years with him and I hope we can give him the car and the team with which he can fight for top positions."</p>
      <p>Seidl said it is "absolutely" his intention to stick with both Sainz and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lando-norris/"><b>Lando Norris</b></a> for the future, even beyond the end of their 2020 contracts.</p>
      <p>"With how Carlos and Lando are performing this season, we have no reason to look elsewhere," he said.</p>
      <p>"The goal is that they grow and mature with us to be drivers of the highest level."</p>
