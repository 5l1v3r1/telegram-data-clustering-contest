Crash the wedding. Grab a mic. Sing a special song. Say adios," he added. "It was actually quite beautiful and the love and mana in that room surrounding the wedding couple was so strong."<br/><br/>The Rock also shared his "congratulations" with the couple and their four children, Ryan, Mason, Edie &amp; Max, before signing off: "Beautiful family."<br/><br/>Jumanji: The Next Level is released in theatres Dec. 13.</p>
