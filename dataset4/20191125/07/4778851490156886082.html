      <p>Police were called to Star City in Birmingham on Saturday evening following reports of 100 youths fighting, some with machetes.</p>
      <p>Five teenagers have been arrested following the trouble, including a 13-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>Blue Story focuses on two friends from different south London postcodes, on rival sides of a street war.</p>
      <p>It is rated 15 for very strong language, strong violence, threat, sex, and drug misuse.</p>

      <p>On Sunday afternoon, a pre-recorded message on the Vue customer service line said: "We regret that we will no longer be screening the film Blue Story at any of our venues."</p>
      <p>Although the film is still listed on the company's website, when attempting to book tickets online, customers are met with an error message.</p>
      <p>A Vue spokesman said: "We can confirm a decision was made to remove the film.</p>
      <p>"The safety and welfare of our customers and staff is always our first priority."</p>
      <p>West Midlands Police said that they did not recommend the film was removed.</p>
      <p>Chief Superintendent Steve Graham said: "We've made no recommendations to Vue at all.</p>
      <p>"If they choose to continue showing it, that's a matter for them."</p>
