      <p>Best Buy has <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">discounted</a> the Xbox One S All-Digital Edition to its Black Friday price in this latest sale.</p>
      <p>That is going to save you $100 off of the regular price. And you get three games included here. Those games include Minecraft, Sea of Thieves, and Fortnite Battle Royale. You also get a free month of Xbox Gold and a controller.</p>
      <p>Since this is the digital edition of the Xbox One S (meaning there's no drive for physical game discs), the games are in the box in the form of a code that you can download into your Xbox One S.</p>

      <p>This is going to make a really great console to pick up this holiday season. Since you are getting three games included and it's just $149. That's a great price, and gives you some games to play in the meantime.</p>
      <p>The Xbox One S All-Digital Edition is the cheapest Xbox One, but that doesn't make it the worst. It's essentially the same as the regular Xbox One S, but without a disk drive. That means that you can still game in 4K HDR, which is definitely a good thing here.</p>
      <p>Since most people are buying games in the digital form these days, this is a really great move by Microsoft. Allowing them to save some money on production of the Xbox One S, and also sell even more consoles. Since $149 for a console is a lot easier to stomach than nearly $500 â€“ the price of the Xbox One X last year.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>There are currently over 2200 games available for the Xbox One, and that includes 200 exclusives and 600 games from the Xbox 360 that are still playable. So if you're worried about not having enough games to play, don't. There's plenty.</p>
      <p>You can pick up the Xbox One S All-Digital Edition and these three games in this Best Buy sale <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/334843/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-one-s-1tb-all-digital-edition-console-disc-free-gaming-white%2F6375659.p%3FskuId%3D6375659">by clicking here.</a></p>
