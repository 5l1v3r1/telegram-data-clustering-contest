      <ul>
        <li>Devil May Cry 3 is coming to the Nintendo Switch in February 2020.</li>
        <li>The game will cost $19.99 and is digital-only.</li>
        <li>The Devil May Cry HD Collection only costs $30 on other platforms.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Devil May Cry 3 is <a href="https://twitter.com/DevilMayCry/status/1198994983434571778">coming to Switch on February 20, 2020</a>, but fans of the series have to put up with Capcom’s ridiculous shenanigans again.</p>
      <p>Devil May Cry 3 will cost gamers $19.99 when it comes out on the Nintendo Switch. That’s the same price <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/devil-may-cry-switch/">as the release of Devil May Cry</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/devil-may-cry-2-switch/">as well as Devil May Cry 2</a>, on the console. The problem here is that it’s only the Switch version of these games that are so expensive.</p>

      <h3>Capcom Sees Pushback from Devil May Cry Fans</h3>
      <p>For comparison, gamers that want to pick up the DMC games on other platforms can grab the Devil May Cry HD Collection. That set contains all three of the Devil May Cry games separately released on Switch. This will only set them back $30 for the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0102-CUSA09407_00-DMCHDC0000000000">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/devil-may-cry-hd-collection/bvnrff9xj6km?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Xbox One</a>, or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/631510/Devil_May_Cry_HD_Collection/">PC versions of that game</a>.</p>
      <p>Just breaking that down easily shows how Capcom is abusing its Switch fans. All three of the games come in one package on other consoles and PC for just half the price of buying them separately on the Switch. It makes no sense whatsoever and is a blatant ripoff!</p>

      <h3>Mega Man Fans Had to Deal with a Similar Problem</h3>
      <p>This is far from the first time Capcom has been sketchy when it comes to Nintendo Switch releases. The game publisher has a habit of putting out collections on the console <a href="http://megaman.capcom.com/mmxlc.html">but only including half the games on the cartridge</a>.</p>
      <p>This was the case with the Mega Man X Legacy Collection 1+2. It also holds true for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/resident-evil-origins-collection-switch/">the various releases</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Resident-Evil-Triple-Pack-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07VHKWQ26">of Resident Evil games</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Resident-Evil-Revelations-Collection-Standard-Nintendo/dp/B074JMQFDY">on the Switch</a>. The difference here is that these games actually have physical releases. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/09/feature_exploring_the_switch_tax_and_why_nintendo_was_right_to_use_game_cards">“Switch tax”</a> likely plays a part in splitting the games up, but it’s still a bad move for consumers.</p>

      <h3>Capcom Couldn’t Keep from Screwing Over Resident Evil Fans Either</h3>
      <p>The Devil May Cry Switch releases aren’t physical. They are only available for purchase digitally. That means there’s no good reason for Capcom to be splitting the games up like this and charging as much as it is.</p>
      <p>But we all know the real reason Capcom is releasing the Devil May Cry games this way: greed.</p>
      <p>The publisher knows the Switch is popular and recognizes that portability is enough for some customers to double-dip on games they already own. It’s plainly taking advantage of these people, and the company should be ashamed of itself.</p>
