      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:59:37+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/gordon-deegan-7.1837475" target="_blank">Gordon Deegan</a></address>
      <p>The company that operates the five-star <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Mount+Juliet">Mount Juliet</a> hotel and golf resort in Co Kilkenny narrowed its losses last year by 7 per cent to €2.99 million.</p>
      <p>Accounts for Mount Juliet Unlimited show that it recorded a reduction in pre-tax losses as revenues surged by 35 per cent to €11.59 million.</p>
      <p>The 500-acre Co Kilkenny estate was acquired by Tetrarch and businessman Emmet O’Neill in a €15 million deal in 2014. It will stage the 2020 Dubai Duty Free Irish Open, the fourth time that the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Thomastown">Thomastown</a> venue has staged the annual event.</p>
      <p>The directors described the trading performance for the year as satisfactory. The loss took account of non cash depreciation costs of €1.4 million and interest payments of €1.6 million.</p>
      <p>The accounts show that €1 million of the interest payments was on shareholder loans while the bulk of the remainder was on bank debts. The loss also takes account of a €420,699 loss on the disposal of a fixed asset.</p>
      <p>The number of people employed at Mount Juliet last year increased from 102 to 118 as staff costs increased from €4.9 million to €5.76 million. The company had a shareholders’ deficit of €8.8 million at the year end.</p>
