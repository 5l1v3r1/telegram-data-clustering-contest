      <h1>Cuomo moves closer to keeping Working Families off the ballot in NY</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:52:39+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:52</time> by <a rel="author">Carl Campanile</a></address>
      <p>With protesters chanting “shame on you!” a panel created by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Legislature approved a plan Monday that could put the left-leaning Working Families Party and other minor political parties out of business.</p>
      <p>The public campaign finance commission voted to raise requirement for minor parties to maintain ballot status from 50,000 votes in statewide elections to at least 130,000 or 2 percent of the total vote.</p>
      <p>The higher threshold could wipe out all but the Conservative Party, whose ballot line garnered 253,000 vote in the race for governor last year, with Republican candidate Marc Molinaro on its ballot line.</p>
      <p>But the Working Families Party got only 114,000 with Democrat Cuomo on its line.</p>
      <p>In what was the political equivalent of a shotgun marriage, <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/10/05/cuomo-agrees-to-run-on-working-families-party-line/">Cuomo agreed to run on the WFP ballot line</a> after the two-term incumbent easily defeated insurgent Cynthia Nixon in the Democratic primary, which the WFP initially backed.</p>
      <p>The Green Party received 104,000 votes; the Libertarian Party, 95,000; and the Independence Party, 69,000 votes.</p>
      <p>Critics of the tougher ballot requirement claim Cuomo was behind it because it was pushed by his appointee Jay Jacobs, chairman of the state Democratic Party. WFP activists claim the measure was payback because it endorsed Nixon over Cuomo last year.</p>
      <p>Cuomo has run on the WFP and Independence Party lines in prior elections and his allies created the Women’s Equality Party line for him run under in 2014.</p>
      <p>The governor has denied he’s out to abolish minor parties.</p>
      <p>During a meeting at Westchester Community College, the measure passed 6 to 3 and will automatically go into effect unless changed by the legislature.</p>
      <p>Commission member Henry Berger, an election lawyer, defended the higher ballot requirement as fair because the 50,000 limit had been set in 1936, when there were fewer voters in the state.</p>
      <p>Berger complained the 50,000 vote threshold allowed the emergency of “vanity parties” over the years, such as the “Rent is Too Damn High” party, Women’s Equality Party and Reform Party. He said some minor parties were created and manipulated by the major parties to help their candidates.</p>

      <p>Cuomo ally Jacobs said, “We are not looking to target political parties. Any credible parties are going to meet these thresholds.”</p>
      <p>He also said the public matching program the commission is crafting would be jeopardized with too many minor parties because candidates would be eligible for more taxpayer funds.</p>
      <p>The change in ballot requirements prompted powerful state lawmakers, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/chuck-schumer-backs-working-families-party-in-shot-at-cuomo/">including Sen. Chuck Schumer</a>, and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, <a href="https://thenypost.wordpress.com/2019/10/29/warren-slams-cuomo-ally-state-dems-for-efforts-to-take-down-third-parties/">to rally around the WFP</a>. The party endorsed Warren for president.</p>
      <p>The WFP on Monday blasted the proposal as anti-democratic.</p>
      <p>“The Public Financing Commission was created to improve our democracy, not restrict it. Any proposal must respect the constitutional right to fusion voting and the role of minor parties in New York’s democracy,” said NY WFP director Bill Lipton.</p>
      <p>He said no state in the nation requires parties to qualify every two years, in both the Presidential and Gubernatorial elections, as the commission proposed. Currently, parties only have to qualify with votes every four years based on the vote in the governor’s race.</p>
      <p>Lipton also objected to the 130,000 vote threshold.</p>
      <p>“Any of these proposals would make New York among the most hostile states to minor parties in the nation. No commissioner should support this undue burden, which is wholly unrelated to the mission of public financing,” he said.</p>
