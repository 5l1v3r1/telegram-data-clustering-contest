      <p>The mother of a premature baby who died at three hours old pumped breast milk for 63 days after – then donated it on her son’s due date.</p>
      <p>Sierra Strangfield made the incredible gesture of kindness after losing her boy Samuel to a genetic condition called Trisomy 18, which causes developmental delays.</p>
      <p>Samuel was born at 25 weeks on September 5 at a hospital near his family’s home in Neillsville, Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>His mother was devastated by his death, but determined to help other sick babies out as best she could.</p>
      <p>And she kept pumping until November 7 – the day she had expected to welcome Samuel into the world. Sierra froze her milk as she went along, then donated it all to her local neo-natal intensive care unit.</p>

      <p>Writing on Facebook, Sierra explained: ‘When I found out I was pregnant again, I wanted nothing more than to be successful at breastfeeding.</p>

      <p>‘But when we found out of Samuel’s diagnosis, I knew that was not going to happen.</p>
      <p>‘Just another hope that was taken from me.</p>
      <p>‘Before Samuel passed, I told myself I would pump my milk to donate.’</p>
      <p>Sierra said her older daughter Porter had received donor milk for months after she was born, with those women’s kindness inspiring her to do the same.</p>

      <p>She added: ‘I couldn’t save Samuel’s life, but maybe I could save another baby’s life .</p>
      <p>‘Pumping is not for the faint of heart. It’s hard.</p>
      <p>‘Mentally and physically. And it’s even harder when you don’t actually have a baby.</p>
      <p>‘There were times I was angry because why did my milk have to come in when I had no baby to feed?</p>
      <p>‘Why was I waking up in the middle of the night for this?</p>
      <p>‘The other part of me felt it was the only thing connecting me to Samuel here on Earthside. I sure hope he’s proud of me!</p>
      <p>‘I pumped for 63 days after his birth. I am not an over supplier by any means- but I did it. </p>
      <p>‘And today, his due date, I donated my milk to the NICU milkbanks for the first and last time.</p>

      <p>‘Walking through the hallways of the hospital was just another step in healing.And I know, (because I felt him), that Samuel was there with me.’</p>
      <p>Sierra’s post was widely shared online, with over a thousand people praising her selfless act of kindness.</p>
      <p>She says she has been wowed by the response, and now hopes to raise further awareness of Trisomy 18.</p>
