      <h2>Manager Neal Ardley has problems at the back</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:30</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Notts County are sweating over the fitness over three of their defenders ahead of their clash against Boreham Wood tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Connell Rawlinson is considered a doubt because of his back seizing up during the defeat to Aldershot at the weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Magpies</a> left-back Damian McCrory has also fractured his fingers while new recruit Alex Lacey has suffered from a tight hamstring.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Mitch Rose is available despite picking up a fifth yellow card at the weekend, but he is not suspended as one of those bookings came in the FA Cup.</p>
      <p>Magpies boss <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Ardley</a> will assess his injured players tomorrow as he predicted Boreham Wood would come to attack at Meadow Lane rather than look to sit back.</p>
      <p>“Damien McCrory has fractured his fingers so his knuckles have swelled up and we’ll have to look at his availability,” he said.</p>

      <p>“Alex Lacey’s hamstring is tight and he might have a strain, while Connell Rawlinson’s back seized up towards the end of Saturday’s game, so that’s three centre-back options struggling at once.</p>
      <p>“Boreham Wood will have a go at us. They did at their place and I think they’ll play similarly to how they did in September, so they will here, too.</p>
      <p>“The manager gets them at it and they play their 3-5-2 system really well. They’ve got a lot of pace and athleticism and were good when we played them before, so we’ll have to get a lot of things right.”</p>
