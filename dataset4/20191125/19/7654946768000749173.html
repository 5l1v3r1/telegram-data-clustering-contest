      <h1>Writer thinks James Mattis’ speechwriter wrote anonymous op-ed, book about Trump</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:36:19+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:36</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Moore</a></address>
      <p>A former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton said he believes <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/05/doj-pressuring-publishing-company-to-reveal-author-of-a-warning/">the anonymous writer</a> of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html?module=inline">scathing New York Times op-ed</a> and tell-all book about the Trump administration is the chief speechwriter for former Defense Secretary James Mattis.</p>
      <p>David Kusnet, writing in <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/155840/guy-wrote-anonymouss-warning">The New Republic</a> on Monday, said he compared the writing styles of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Warning/dp/1538718464?tag=nypost-20">A Warning</a>,” which was published on Nov. 19, with former Pentagon aide Guy Snodgrass’ memoir “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Holding-Line-Inside-Pentagon-Secretary/dp/0593084373?tag=nypost-20">Holding the Line</a>,” which was published in October.</p>
      <p>Kusnet said by reading the two works the “clues to Anonymous’s identity are apparent.”</p>

      <p>“As in ‘A Warning,’ the sentences and paragraphs are pithy and punchy. Every chapter in both books begins with an inspiring but not cliched quotation from an historic figure,” Kusnet writes in making his case that Snodgrass is Anonymous.</p>
      <p>“Many passages in both books are remarkably similar: the ordeal of conducting a Pentagon briefing for Trump; national security staffers exchanging appalled asides about Trump’s conduct of foreign policy via Twitter; and the arguments for why American alliances strengthen national security and immigration policy shouldn’t be based on building a border wall,” he continued.</p>
      <p>Snodgrass, a 43-year-old retired naval aviator and Top Gun instructor, <a href="https://twitter.com/GuySnodgrass/status/1199005425447899136">tweeted</a> “the swirl continues…” and linked to a copy of the New Republic article.</p>
      <p>Kusnet said that while some of what Anonymous wrote in “A Warning” appears to disqualify Snodgrass, other qualities mark him as the author.</p>
      <p>“Snodgrass checks three boxes: He can write. He knows and cares about national security — a major theme of ‘A Warning.’ And, to borrow from his description of Mattis, he is ‘a badass’ who eventually offended his hero and won a pre-publication battle with the Pentagon over the release of ‘Holding the Line,'” Kusnet wrote.</p>
      <p>Snodgrass did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Kusnet’s supposition.</p>
