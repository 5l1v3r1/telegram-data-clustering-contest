      <h1>ESPN Analyst Releases Score Prediction For Nebraska-Iowa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:54:01+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Nebraska and Iowa will meet Friday in their annual post-Thanksgiving rivalry clash. Iowa has won the last four meetings between the two Midwestern programs.</p>
      <p>This would be an opportune time for the Huskers to snap their losing streak vs. the Hawkeyes. Nebraska needs a W to finish 6-6 and reach bowl eligibility.</p>
      <p>Overall, it has been a disappointing second season for Scott Frost, but a win over Iowa would at least close out the regular season on a high note and send the team to the postseason.</p>
      <p>As for Iowa, the Hawkeyes are a workmanlike 8-3, with a shot at their sixth 10-win season under Kirk Ferentz if they can win on Friday and win their bowl game.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Bill Connelly has <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28156003/everything-need-know-college-football-rivalry-week">released his score predictions</a> for this weekend. Using his SP+ formula, he’s made his pick for Iowa-Nebraska.</p>
      <blockquote><b>SP+ projection</b>: Iowa 30, Nebraska 21</blockquote>
      <p>Iowa and Nebraska will kick off at 2:30 p.m. ET on Friday from Memorial Stadium in Lincoln.</p>
      <p>BTN will broadcast the action.</p>
