      <p>A US military dog who played a starring role in the raid that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi seemed oblivious to the praise Donald Trump heaped on him at the White House.</p>
      <p>Conan, a Belgian Malinois, seemed much more interested in the head scratches he was getting from Mike Pence, repeatedly looking up at the vice president in search of more attention.</p>

      <p>Mr Trump used a slew of adjectives to describe “ultimate fighter” Conan, who was injured when he was exposed to electrical wires in the late October raid while chasing al-Baghdadi at the terrorist’s compound in north-west Syria.</p>
      <p>The president called Conan “incredible, brilliant, smart and very special”.</p>
      <p>“So this is Conan,” Mr Trump said. “Right now, probably the world’s most famous dog.”</p>

      <p>He bestowed a medal on Conan and presented the “tough cookie” with a plaque. First lady Melania Trump stood a few feet away.</p>
      <p>The president said initially Conan was going to be muzzled for the appearance, but Mr Trump said he thought that would put the dog in attack mode.</p>
      <p>“He’s not in a bad mood today,” he told dozens of reporters, cameramen and members of TV crews gathered in the Rose Garden. “So you’re safe.”</p>

      <p>He said he asked members of the US special forces who met him on Monday if an unarmed man would stand a chance against Conan. He said the fighters, who could not appear in public, told him “No”.</p>
      <p>“Conan is really a hero,” Mr Pence said, patting the dog on the head.</p>
