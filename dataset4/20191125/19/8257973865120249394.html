      <p>Nov. 25 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Dennis_Quaid/?tps=1">Dennis Quaid</a> isn't bothered by his nearly 40-year age gap with his fiancée.</p>
      <p>The 65-year-old actor addressed his relationship with Laura Savoie, a 26-year-old PhD student, in an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/25/dennis-quaid-i-didnt-go-looking-for-someone-younger-on-his-new-love-and-new-roles">interview</a> with The Guardian published Monday following their engagement.</p>
      <p>"That was really a laugh," Quaid said of public reaction. "I thought it was wonderful, actually."</p>
      <p>"Everyone comes from the perspective of their own life and so I can't comment on the way they feel; I can't even get angry," he added.</p>
      <p>Quaid was previously married to Kimberly Quaid and actresses <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Meg_Ryan/?tps=1">Meg Ryan</a> and P.J. Soles. He said he's found "a real partner" in Savoie, despite their age difference.</p>
      <p>"I didn't go out looking for an age gap or someone really younger than me," Quaid said. "I met her at a business event and then the relationship developed. You have no control over who you fall in love with. I don't fall in love easily. But I can't let what a few people think control all that."</p>
      <p>"I've been married three times and this is the final one, I know it is. I feel like I have a real partner in life," he added.</p>
      <p>Quaid and Savoie were first linked in June. Quaid <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/10/21/Dennis-Quaid-engaged-to-girlfriend-Laura-Savoie/7181571678686/">announced his engagement</a> to Savoie in October.</p>
      <p>"She's a beautiful, beautiful woman. She's an incredible person," he told Entertainment Tonight. "I'm really as happy as I can be."</p>
      <p>Elaine Hendrix, who co-starred with Quaid in <i>The Parent Trap</i> (1998), teased Quaid on Twitter following news of his engagement. In the film, Quaid's character, Nick Parker, gets engaged to a 26-year-old woman (Hendrix), whom his 11-year-old twin daughters (<a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Lindsay_Lohan/?tps=1">Lindsay Lohan</a>) do not approve of.</p>
      <p>"Watch out for those twins," Hendrix <a href="https://twitter.com/elaine4animals/status/1186349536609996800">wrote</a>.</p>
      <p>Quaid has a 27-year-old son, Jack, with Ryan, and 12-year-old twins, son Thomas and daughter Zoe, with Kimberly Quaid.</p>
      <p>Quaid will star in the new Netflix series<i> Merry Happy Whatever</i>, which premieres Thursday.</p>
