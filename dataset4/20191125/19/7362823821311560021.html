      <h1>Ariana Grande falls off stage during concert, laughs it off: 'Things were going too well'</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ariana-grande">Ariana Grande</a> is laughing off the tumble she took during a concert on Sunday.</p>
      <p>During a performance of “Bad Idea,” the 27-year-old strutted down the stage at the Amalie Arena in Tampa before losing her footing. She was ultimately saved by a properly-placed backup dancer, who lifted the pop star back onto the stage.</p>

      <p>Grande’s fall comes amid a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ariana-grande-very-sick-may-cancel-tour-dates">potential cancellation</a> of her tour after the “thank u, next” singer revealed that she fell ill with a bad sinus condition.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old said on her Instagram Story on Nov. 16 that “my throat and head are still in so much pain.”</p>

      <p>“I’m just in a lot of pain and it’s difficult to breathe during the show,” she said in a message to her fans. “I just really don’t know what’s happening with my body right now and need to figure it out.</p>
      <p>“I’m scared that I might have to cancel some things, so this is kind just a heads up of like I don’t know what’s happening with my body, and I’m really disappointed and freaked out of why I can’t get better because it’s been over three weeks at this point,” she added.</p>
