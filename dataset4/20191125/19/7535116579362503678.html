      <p>According to <a href="https://www.hmetro.com.my/mutakhir/2019/11/520322/kkm-tiada-kuasa-larang-pemandu-mabuk">Harian Metro</a>, Deputy Minister of Health, Lee Boon Chye, said that the regulation of drunk driving is a problem that is out of their hands as it should be handled by local authorities and Road Transport Department (JPJ).</p>
      <p>‚ÄúDrinking alcohol is a different matter, the ministry has the authority to regulate smoking in accordance with the Food Act to control where smoking can be and so on.‚Äù</p>
      <p>What MOH can control is the type of alcohol and the alcohol content that is permitted in the country.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúMOH also has the authority to prohibit alcohol from those under 21 years of age‚Äù, said the minister during a press conference at Ipoh Town Hall, today. But this does not extend to the regulation of alcohol consumption on the roads.</p>
      <p>Boon Chye clarified this claim when asked to comment on the growing issue of drunk driving cases reported by netizens on social media daily. The Minister of Health said many citizens have proposed that the MOH enforce a ban on alcohol consumption at certain times and locations even though such a matter is out of their control.</p>

      <p>Nonetheless, the minister also took the opportunity to remind the public that driving under the influence of alcohol is unreasonable and unacceptable as it doesn‚Äôt just put the driver‚Äôs life at risk but rather that of all pedestrians and road users as well.</p>
      <p>While the clarification is necessary, it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that drunk driving has become a persisting problem in our society lately. So many lives are lost unnecessarily because of this dangerous behaviour. Let‚Äôs do our part to ensure safer roads by spreading awareness.</p>
