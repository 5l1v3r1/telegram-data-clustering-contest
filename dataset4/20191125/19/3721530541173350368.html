      <p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://youtu.be/ut1RDkshzgU">players found a new Legendary weapon</a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/borderlands-3/40522"><i>Borderlands 3</i></a>: the Good Juju. Players familiar with either the first <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/destiny/3649"><i>Destiny</i></a><i> </i>or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/destiny-2/39651"><i>Destiny 2</i></a> should recognize the name as a clear play on Bad Juju, an Exotic weapon in both games.</p>
      <p><i>Borderlands</i><i> 3’</i>s Good Juju shares quite a bit with Destiny’s Bad. Both weapons feature a monster carcass on the front — with <i>Destiny 2</i>’s being a skull and <i>Borderlands 3</i>’s being a goopy alien mouth. The two weapons also share a similar perk, which causes kills to instantly reload the weapon. Like Bad Juju, Good Juju is a steady, multi-round burst weapon with great stats.</p>

      <p>If the look, function, and name doesn’t sell you on Gearbox’s clear homage to Bungie, consider the text found on the Good Juju’s weapon profile. The Good Juju comes with the text “kinda, sorta wants to end all existence.” Bad Juju’s lore description in <i>Destiny 2</i> reads: “If you believe your weapon wants to end all existence, then so it will.”</p>

      <p>Here’s a visual comparison for Good Juju and Bad Juju</p>
      <footer>Gearbox via Joltzdude139 and Bungie via Polygon</footer>
      <p><i>Borderlands 3</i> players can pick up the weapon from The Rampager on the new Mayhem 4 difficulty, according to <i>Borderlands 3</i> YouTuber Joltzdude139. The weapon looks pretty strong in <i>Borderlands 3</i>, and seems more reliable than the average gun. However, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQWLfD-5sexEbVY335J8PMg">Joltzdude139 does say in his review</a> that the weapon isn’t up to the Mayhem 4 quality.</p>
      <p>But the gun Good Juju emulates is up to almost any task in <i>Destiny 2</i>. Fans have loved Bad Juju since the first <i>Destiny</i>. While the perks may not be as appealing as some other Exotic weapons — Bad Juju charges the wielder’s Super ability over time and reloads the magazine on a kill — the weapon is very reliable. Fans are fond of Bad Juju because you can use it in basically any situation, and always get some kind of use out of it.</p>
      <p>Sometimes it’s nice to see our favorite games pay homage to the great works of others.</p>
