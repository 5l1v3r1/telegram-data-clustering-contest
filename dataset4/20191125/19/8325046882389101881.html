      <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-truck-pictures-info-details-price-2019-11">Cybertruck unveil</a> drew a strong reaction last Thursday for several reasons. There’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-everything-that-happened-when-elon-musk-unveiled-the-cybertruck-2019-11">the wild theatrics</a> Musk employed to introduce the vehicle – which included a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/grimes-elon-musk-cybertruck-unveil-as-cybergirl-2019-11">“cybergirl”</a> and flames – as well as a demo that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/video-tesla-cybertruck-launch-blooper-armour-windows-smashed-oops-2019-11">took an unexpected turn</a> when the truck’s windows cracked.</p>
      <p>But it’s the Cybertruck’s unconventional appearance that earned it the most attention in the days following Musk’s announcement. Some spectators <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-cybertruck-roasted-twitter-2019-11">roasted the Cybertruck’s design</a> on Twitter, comparing the truck’s sharp angles and offbeat look to poorly rendered video game graphics and cartoons.</p>
      <p>Although the Cybertruck has been at the center of many jokes in recent days, not everyone had negative things to say about it. Several prominent figures in the technology industry, including executives from Twitter and Facebook, have come forward with compliments about Tesla’s first pickup truck.</p>

      <h3>Outside of the technology landscape, Blade Runner artistic director Syd Mead thinks highly of Tesla’s Cybertruck, telling Business Insider’s Aaron Holmes in an emailed statement that it “has completely changed the vocabulary of the personal truck market design.”</h3>

      <p>The Cybertruck starts at $39,900 and features an exterior made of stainless steel and armored glass, six passenger seats, and an adjustable air suspension. Tesla is offering three configuration options: a single-motor rear-wheel drive version, a dual-motor all-wheel drive edition, and a tri-motor all-wheel-drive variant. Production of the vehicle is scheduled to begin in 2021.</p>
      <p>Despite the truck’s mixed reception, Tesla is already racking up preorders for the Cybertruck. Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198788116372344832">revealed in a tweet</a> on Sunday that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cybertruck-orders-tesla-elon-musk-2019-11">200,000 pre-orders had been placed</a> for the Cybertruck so far.</p>
