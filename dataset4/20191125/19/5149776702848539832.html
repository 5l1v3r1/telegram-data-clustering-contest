      <h1>Mike Ashley's Sports Direct confirms it could rebrand as Frasers Group</h1>
      <h2>Shareholders will vote on the rebrand next month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:35:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:35</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Barlow</a></address>
      <p>Sports Direct International, the retail business founded by tycoon Mike Ashley, has announced a plan to rebrand as Frasers Group.</p>
      <p>The company has tabled a shareholder vote to change its company name to Frasers Group as the <a href="https://www.business-live.co.uk/all-about/east-midlands">business</a> attempts to improve its image.</p>
      <p>Shareholders will vote on the proposed rebrand on December 16.</p>
      <p>The move follows a recent announcement that the retailer will launch a new lifestyle store chain called Frasers on the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/new-scheme-ask-passengers-wear-3574991">high street</a> within the new financial year.</p>
      <p>Headquartered in Shirebrook, on the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire border, Sports Direct said the change had been proposed to "reflect the changing profile and consumer proposition of the group".</p>
      <p>It said the move was "reflective of the business strategy of the company to elevate its retail proposition across all channels and demonstrates the transformation of the company over recent years into the holder of a diversified portfolio of sports, fitness, fashion and lifestyle fascias".</p>
      <p>The company added it was once "solely a leading international retailer in sports apparel" but now "equally as successful in the lifestyle and luxury markets".</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Mr Ashley, owner of Newcastle United, signalled his recent acquisition drive had been placed on hold.</p>

      <p>The company has faced a series of challenges in its retail portfolio, including efforts to turn around the 'terminal' problems at House of Fraser, which Sports Direct bought out of administration last summer.</p>
      <p>Locally, the department store was due to close at the intu Victoria Centre at the start of this year before it was dramatically saved from the axe <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/nottingham-house-fraser-store-remain-2455193">after a rental agreement was reached with intu</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite Sports Direct's profits having fallen in 2017, it was reported in May that Mr Ashley had retained his position <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/mike-ashley-tops-list-20-2849686">as the richest man in the East Midlands</a>.</p>
      <p>The FTSE 250 company has also in the last 18 months purchased Sofa.com and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/hundreds-jobs-risk-evans-cycles-2165246">Evans Cycles</a>.</p>
