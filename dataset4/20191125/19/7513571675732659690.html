        <b>Adams Oshiomhole, national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has pleaded with all APC governors to implement the N30,000 minimum wage and the consequential adjustments.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Oshiomhole made the plea at the federal government- Progressives Governors’ Forum parley in Jos, Plateau state capital, on Monday.</p>
      <p>“As progressives, let us be the first to pay the new national minimum wage and not just the wage but also the consequential adjustments arising from it,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Already, there are some proactive progressive governors that have taken steps to address this. I plead that you give this a priority, because when other governors are fighting whether or not to pay, you will say that progressive governors have paid.</p>
      <p>“Where there is will, there will certainly be a way.”</p>
      <p>The APC national chairman also called on the APC governors to support border closure by the federal government.</p>
      <p>He said the nation’s borders should remain closed until neighboring countries follow the protocols of fair trade.</p>
      <p>In an interview with reporters, Oshiomole expressed support for financial autonomy of local governments in the country.</p>
      <p>He said local government autonomy was not negotiable.</p>
      <p>According him, just as the federal government does not control state governors on how to manage their money, so should the state governors allow the local governments to function.</p>
      <p>He added that local governments should be allowed to operate the same way states operate with the federal government exercising oversight function.</p>
      <p>“Local governments should be autonomous, but autonomy doesn’t mean there should not be oversight,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The same way the Federal Government goes after a state Governor that breaks the financial rule, the same way state governor should go after local government that mismanages revenue that accrue to it.”</p>
