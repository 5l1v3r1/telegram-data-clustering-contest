      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele/">Adele</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/who-is-im-a-celebrity-star-adele-roberts-girlfriend-kate-holderness-11183108/"> Roberts’ girlfriend</a> Kate Holderness has begun her trek to join her other half in Australia as the I’m a Celebrity elimination days loom.</p>
      <p>The actress and vlogger posted a sweet snap of her and Adele ahead of her trip over to the other side of the world, sharing her excitement at being reunited with her ‘queen’.</p>
      <p>Alongside the picture, she wrote: ‘10,307 miles, I’m coming for ya!! Adventure starts tomorrow! Can’t WAIT to get on that bloody bridge &amp; get my little Jungle Queen!!!!! <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/teamadele/">#TeamAdele</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/imaceleb/">#ImACeleb</a>’</p>
      <p>Adele has been keeping viewers entertained over the past week as she grafts in with the Bushtucker Trials, which have included some gruesome eating trials.</p>
      <p>Among the disgusting concoctions she’s taken on is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-a-celebrity-recap-adele-roberts-gags-on-pig-uterus-as-caitlyn-jenner-reveals-shes-treated-differently-as-a-woman-11191546/">pig uterus which left her feeling ill</a>, and the gag-inducing vomit fruit.</p>
      <p>It’s a far cry from her and Kate’s YouTube series Friday Night Fakeaway, where they recreate much-loved takeaway treats with a healthy twist.</p>
