      <h1>Man City and Man United interested in Brazilian wonderkid – Claim of €100m price tag</h1>

      <p>Brazilian wonderkid Gabriel Veron is today the subject of a piece brought by Italian outlet <a href="https://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/talent-scout/2019/11/24-63760348/gabriel_veron_la_stella_del_mondiale_under_17/">Corriere Dello Sport.</a></p>
      <p>An article on their website gives an introduction to the Palmeiras talent, who’s just been elected the best player at the U17 World Cup.</p>
      <p>Now the most interesting thing is that Corriere Dello Sport brings some clubs who would be interested in him. The list is made up of Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Manchester United.</p>
      <p>It’s pretty natural to see big sides being linked to a Brazilian wonderkid, but it’s interesting to see it coming first from Italy, since these rumours haven’t showed up in Brazil yet.</p>
      <p>Gabriel Veron has just signed a new deal with Palmeiras, extending his contract to 2024. Although Corriere Dello Sport says the clubs would have to spend €100m to sign him, reliable Brazilian outlets such as <a href="https://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/palmeiras/noticia/palmeiras-faz-acordo-para-renovar-o-contrato-de-gabriel-veron-destaque-do-mundial-sub-17.ghtml">Globo Esporte</a> say his release clause is actually €60m.</p>
      <p>Veron finished the U17 World Cup with three goals and three assists, and should soon be having his first chance to play for Palmeiras’ first team.</p>
      <p>In case you’re wondering, the teenager is indeed named after former Manchester United midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron. But that wasn’t his parents’ idea. It was actually a request made by his neighbour.</p>
      <p><i>“It was because of Argentina’s midfielder Juan Sebastián. It was my neighbour’s idea. He always wanted to have a son, but failed, had three girls. Then my mother and father were undecided (during pregnancy), and the neighbour said: put Veron. My parents liked it,”</i> he told <a href="https://chuteirafc.cartacapital.com.br/https-chuteirafc-cartacapital-com-br-mundial-sub-17-conho-de-vaqueiro/">Carta Capital.</a></p>
