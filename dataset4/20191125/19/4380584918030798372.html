        <b>Pirates aim to pick manager by Thanksgiving</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 25:</i> The Pirates have narrowed their managerial search to Twins bench coach Derek Shelton and Rays bench coach Matt Quatraro, according to a report from <a href="https://twitter.com/JonHeyman/status/1198978324959240192">MLB Network insider Jon Heyman</a>. The plan within the organization is to make a decision before Thanksgiving if possible, according to an additional report from <a href="https://twitter.com/Joelsherman1/status/1199039781361135616">MLB Network insider Joel Sherman</a>. The Pirates are the only team that has yet to hire a manager for the 2020 season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>With Cherington in as GM, Pirates turn attention to skipper search</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 15:</i> The Pirates offered Ben Cherington their general manager job Friday, and <a href="https://www.mlb.com/pirates/news/ben-cherington-offered-pirates-gm-job">he has accepted</a>, a source told MLB.com's Adam Berry.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2019/11/14/ben-cherington-pirates-gm-search-pittsburgh/stories/201911140185">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Jason Mackey</a> and MLB Network insider Jon Heyman were first to report that the Bucs presented Cherington with the role.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The 45-year-old Cherington had been the Blue Jays' vice president of baseball operations since September 2016. He was previously the Red Sox GM, including during their 2013 World Series championship season.</p>
      <p>The Pirates also still need to hire a new manager, and that search presumably should pick up now that Cherington is in place.</p>
      <p>Twins bench coach Derek Shelton, A's quality control coach Mark Kotsay and Rays bench coach Matt Quatraro are among the batch of candidates who have been considered for Pirates skipper to this point -- before the search was paused while the organization focused on hiring a GM. What isn't known, however, is whether Cherington will look to meet with someone else outside of that group before making a final decision, as Heyman noted.</p>

        <b>Giants name Kapler manager</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 12:</i> The Giants named Gabe Kapler their new manager on Tuesday. The former Phillies manager will take over as Bruce Bochy's successor in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>The team announced that Kapler has agreed to terms on a three-year contract.</p>
      <p>Kapler beat out a pair of other finalists for the Giants job -- Astros bench coach Joe Espada and Rays bench coach Matt Quatraro.</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old Kapler spent the last two seasons managing Philadelphia, finishing 80-82 in 2018 and 81-81 in '19. Under Kapler, the Giants will try to snap a run of three straight losing seasons since the team's last postseason appearance in 2016. <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/gabe-kapler-giants-manager">More &gt;</a></p>

        <b>Report: Shelton enjoys 'fantastic' interview with Pirates</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 12:</i> Consider Rocco Baldelli's American League Manager of the Year victory as another resume booster for Twins bench coach Derek Shelton, who already appears to be emerging in the Pirates' managerial search according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/JonHeyman/status/1194397866644520960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>Shelton has been linked to the Pirates dating back to the start of their search. Baldelli described him as his "right-hand" man while accepting his Manager of the Year Award on Tuesday after the pair helped Minnesota win 101 games. He briefly worked alongside Cherington as a quality control coach for the Blue Jays in 2017, and overlapped with Arnold on the Rays earlier this decade.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Giants' choice could come 'very soon'</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 11:</i> The Giants expect to name their next manager "very soon," according to a report Monday from NBC Sports Bay Area's Alex Pavlovic.</p>
      <p>But they haven't settled on that manager yet. While Astros bench coach Joe Espada was previously reported to be a frontrunner, former Phillies manager Gabe Kapler met with the Giants again on Monday, per Pavlovic, and Rays bench coach Matt Quatraro is also still a finalist.</p>

        <b>Espada frontrunner to become next Giants manager?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 10:</i> The Giants filled one important vacancy Sunday with the announcement that former Cubs assistant general manager Scott Harris is San Francisco's new general manager. Next, the club will make a final decision on its next manager after Bruce Bochy helmed the club from 2007-19. And according to NBC Sports Bay Area's Alex Pavlovic, a frontrunner may have emerged among the three finalists -- Astros bench coach Joe Espada, former Phillies manager Gabe Kapler and Rays bench coach Matt Quatraro.</p>
      <p>"The next decision is manager, and that's coming this week," Pavlovic tweeted. "Giants have been remarkably quiet, but some people familiar with search believe Joe Espada is the frontrunner. He was at Oracle Park a few days ago meeting with front office."</p>
      <p>Harris is familiar with two of the candidates, as he helped conduct interviews for Espada and Kapler before the Cubs ultimately chose David Ross to become their next manager.</p>

        <b>Giants' new GM interviewed two of their three managerial finalists with Cubs</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 10:</i> The Giants hired Scott Harris as the team's next general manager on Sunday, after he spent two years as the Cubs' assistant GM and seven years in the Cubs organization in total. The Giants have yet to make a managerial hire, but are reportedly down to Astros bench coach Joe Espada, former Phillies manager Gabe Kapler and Rays bench coach Matt Quatraro as finalists. <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/giants/article/Giants-hire-Cubs-assistant-to-be-their-new-14824208.php#photo-18589627">The San Francisco Chronicle</a> points out that since Harris was the Cubs' assistant GM until he was hired by the Giants, he took part in the interview process as the Cubs sought to replace Joe Maddon as manager. The team ultimately chose David Ross, but did interview both Kapler and Espada in their search. Harris was part of those interviews and therefore already has insight to provide the organization as they decide upon the next skipper, even though he wasn't there for the Giants' initial interviews with those candidates.</p>

        <b>Giants impressed by Espada, could have decision 'soon'</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 7:</i> Astros' bench coach Joe Espada interviewed with the Giants again on Wednesday in San Francisco, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/Feinsand/status/1192597937739710467">MLB.com's Mark Feinsand</a>, and the team was impressed with him. While no decision is imminent, the team could be making its choice for manager "soon."</p>
      <p>Espada has been the Astros bench coach since the start of the 2018 season, when the team's former bench coach Alex Cora left to manage the Red Sox. Before that, he spent three seasons as the Yankees' infield coach and third base coach, and a year prior to that working as a special assistant to GM Brian Cashman. Before the Yankees, Espada was the Marlins' third base coach from 2010-13.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Giants' list of managerial candidates reportedly down to 3</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 6:</i> Six of the eight managerial vacancies around the Majors have been filled, with only the Giants and Pirates still needing a skipper. One of those clubs appears to be getting closer to concluding its search, however.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/giants/article/Giants-pare-list-of-managerial-candidates-to-Gabe-14814459.php">San Francisco Chronicle reports</a> that the Giants have narrowed down their list to three finalists: former Phillies manager Gabe Kapler, Astros bench coach Joe Espada and Rays bench coach Matt Quatraro. Royals quality-control/catching coach Pedro Grifol is out of the running.</p>
      <p>Bob Geren, Hensley Meulens, Mark Kotsay, Will Venable, Ron Wotus were the other known candidates for the job. Quatraro was also reported to be a candidate with the Pirates, but it's unknown if he's still in the mix in Pittsburgh.</p>

        <b>Mets haven't approached Collins about bench-coach position</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 2:</i> After naming Carlos Beltrán as their new manager on Friday, the Mets now must pick a bench coach for the first-time skipper, and it appears the former big leaguer is hoping a familiar face gets the call. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/martinonyc/status/1190341817864269826">SNY's Andy Martino</a>, Beltrán has informed the team that Terry Collins -- the Mets' manager from 2011-17 -- would be the ideal bench coach.</p>
      <p>Collins hasn't been approached yet for the position, according to MLB.com's Anthony DiComo, but the New York Post <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/02/terry-collins-could-resurface-with-carlos-beltrans-mets/">reports</a> that he has been discussed internally as a possibility.</p>
      <p>While Collins only managed Beltrán for four months in 2011 before the outfielder was traded to the Giants for Zack Wheeler, the two are said to have a close relationship.</p>
      <p>The Mets finished under .500 in five of Collins' seven seasons at the helm, but they made the postseason in the other two and reached the World Series in 2015. He's still on the payroll as a special assistant to general manager Brodie Van Wagenen.</p>

        <b>Royals hire Matheny</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Oct. 31:</i> The Royals hired Mike Matheny as their new manager on Thursday, introducing him at a news conference at Kauffman Stadium.</p>
      <p>Matheny managed the Cardinals for parts of seven seasons from 2012-18 before he was dismissed and joined the Royals' front office as a special advisor to player development. He'll become the retired Ned Yost's successor in Kansas City.</p>
      <p>Matheny had a 591-474 record in St. Louis (.555 winning percentage), with a winning record every season. The Cardinals made four playoff appearances, winning three National League Central titles and one NL pennant.</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old is the 17th manager in Royals history. <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/mike-matheny-to-be-royals-new-manager">More &gt;</a></p>

        <b>List of Pirates candidates continue to grow</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Oct. 25:</i> New names continue to emerge in the Pirates' managerial search. According to MLB Network insider Ken Rosenthal, Rays bench coach Matt Quatraro and Pirates third-base coach Joey Cora are among those who have interviewed for the job.</p>

      <p>Pirates special assistant Jeff Banister, D-backs vice president of player development Mike Bell, A's bench coach Ryan Christenson, Cardinals first-base coach Stubby Clapp, Astros bench coach Joe Espada, A's quality-control coach Mark Kotsay and Twins bench coach Derek Shelton also have been connected to the position.</p>
      <p>Out of those candidates, Banister is the only one with previous experience managing in the Majors (not including interim stints). Banister led the Rangers from 2015-18, winning the American League Manager of the Year Award in his first year at the helm.</p>
      <p>At least Banister, Christenson, Cora, Kotsay and Shelton have interviewed in person, according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman.</p>

        <b>Bochy hopes to return to managing</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Oct. 24:</i> Although his tenure with the Giants is over after 13 seasons, Bruce Bochy isn't retired. In an appearance on Mad Dog Sports Radio on SiriusXM, the 64-year-old indicated that he wants to return to managing in the future.</p>
      <p>"I'm just hitting the pause button," Bochy told Christopher "Mad Dog" Russo on Thursday. "Taking a sabbatical here for a year and I'll see where I'm at. I don't know how I'm going to feel, but I'd love to have one more shot."</p>
      <p>San Francisco went just 214-272 (.440) over the past three seasons, but Bochy led the club to World Series titles in 2010, '12 and '14. He also managed the Padres to a World Series berth in 1998.</p>
