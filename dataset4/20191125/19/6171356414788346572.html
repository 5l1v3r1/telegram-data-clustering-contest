      <h1>Jaybird X4 wireless headphones marked down to $70 ($40 off), their lowest price yet</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:32:09+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/cody-english/" target="_blank">Cody English</a></address>
      <p>Given the recent rise of truly wireless earbuds, we're starting to see some quality sales on the previous generation of tethered Bluetooth earbuds. Today, we have a deal from Jaybird (a headphone maker known for their fitness-focused lineup) on their X4 wireless earbuds, which are marked down to $70 on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jaybird-Bluetooth-Headphones-Compatible-Smartphones/dp/B07GVCZPSJ?tag=androidpolice-20">Amazon</a>— their lowest price yet. It looks like the X4s have been available for around $110 for most of the year, and this latest reduction could save you an additional $40.</p>
      <p>AP's own Taylor Kerns <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/09/19/jaybird-x4-review-great-earbuds-without-much-new-offer/">spent some time with the Jaybird X4's</a> last year and found them to be an excellent set of earbuds for the fitness crowd that featured high-quality sound and a manufacturer's first IPX7 rating. However, they also brought along some baggage from the days before completely wireless models with handy charging cases became the norm for Bluetooth buds. Namely, a proprietary pin-based charging dongle that connects via USB Type-A. Thankfully, you won't be charging these earbuds too often as Jaybird claims 8 hours of battery life per charge.</p>

      <p> While the X4s have seen previous markdowns, this is the lowest price we've seen yet for these headphones. For more deals like this, make sure to check out our <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/19/black-friday-2019/">Black Friday 2019 Hub</a>.</p>
