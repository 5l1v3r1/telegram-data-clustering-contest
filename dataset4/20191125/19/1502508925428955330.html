      <h1>Facial recognition at Chaayos sparks calls for data protection law</h1>
      <h2>Customers at Chaayos complained about the camera technology they said captured images of them without their consent, with no information on what the data would be used for, and no option to opt out</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:35:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:35</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>The use of facial recognition technology at a popular Indian cafe chain that triggered a backlash among customers, led to calls from human rights advocates on Monday for the government to speed up the introduction of laws to protect privacy.</p>
      <p>Customers at <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/chaayos">Chaayos </a>took to social media during the last week to complain about the camera technology they said captured images of them without their consent, with no information on what the data would be used for, and no option to opt out.</p>
      <p>While the technology is marketed as a convenience, the lack of legislative safeguards to protect against the misuse of data can lead to “breaches of privacy, misidentification and even profiling of individuals”, said Joanne D’Cunha, associate counsel at Internet Freedom Foundation, a digital rights group.</p>
      <p>“Until India introduces a comprehensive <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/data-protection">data protection </a>law that provides such guarantees, there needs to be a moratorium on any technology that would infringe upon an individual’s right to privacy and other rights that stem from it,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from New Delhi.</p>
      <p>A statement from <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/chaayos">Chaayos </a>said the technology was being tested in select cafes and was aimed at reducing purchase times for customers.</p>
      <p>The data was encrypted, would not be shared, and customers could choose to opt out, it added.</p>
      <p>“We are extremely conscious about our customers’ data security and privacy and are committed to protecting it,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>A Personal <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/data-protection">Data Protection </a>Bill is scheduled to be introduced by lawmakers in the current parliamentary session to December 13.</p>
