      <p>Noted spiritual conduit Dan King visits Kelowna Wednesday night for a live show called Soulgasm, to benefit the Paws it Forward dog rescue.</p>
      <p>King has worked with Deepak Chopra, Sylvia Browne, and talk show host Montel Williams.</p>
      <p>He prides himself on his ability to help others by connecting them with deceased loved ones or understanding the deepest parts of their well-being. </p>
      <p>Doors open at 6:30 p.m. at the Days Inn by Wyndham in Kelowna, and King will begin the night with an open talk focused on 'what life is, who we are and why we're here' at 7 p.m.</p>
      <p>"At the end of the day, if I want to be known as anything, it's somebody that guided people back to self love," King says.</p>
      <p>Following the talk, King will conduct an audience Q&amp;A where each guest can ask a question in the form of a reading.</p>
      <p>For each ticket sold, $5 will be donated towards Paws it Forward.</p>
      <p>"I've always been an animal lover. Animals, too are, the closest thing to what our soul really is – and that is unconditional love," says King.</p>
      <p>The event runs to 10 p.m. and seating is limited. For more information and to get tickets, click <a href="https://www.eventbee.com/v/soulgasm-the-live-experience-w-dan-king/event?eid=195088052&amp;fbclid=IwAR2MBzeRNHUNB0CZ1oLNr5LAKr_avlWRDwaPeWAuwoEw64boy45EImDIR_U#/tickets">here.</a></p>
