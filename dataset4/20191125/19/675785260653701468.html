      <h1>Gary Neville reaches two conclusions with 'fundamentally wrong' Man Utd front three</h1>
      <h2>Manchester United fought back against Sheffield United on Sunday but Gary Neville highlighted problems with Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Daniel James</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:43:36+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:43</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Gary Neville has criticised the performance of Manchester United's attacking players in their draw with Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>United trailed 2-0 at Bramall Lane before mounting a stirring comeback to take the lead, only for the hosts to rescue a point late on.</p>
      <p>Marcus Rashford had put United ahead after crossing for Mason Greenwood's equaliser but was very ineffective before then, as were Daniel James and Anthony Martial.</p>
      <p>Neville was particularly critical of the trio and suggested Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has work to do to improve things moving forward.</p>

      <p>"The lack of penetration and work rate of the front three was particularly disappointing," he said on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football.</p>
      <p>"James, Martial, Rashford. They aren't bad lads and they have talent but there is something fundamentally wrong in the first 70 minutes. That cannot happen at that club.</p>
      <p>"I can expect inconsistency in terms of performance levels and missing chances, but not work ethic and application and attitude."</p>
      <p>Neville went on to suggest Solskjaer must spend big in January to ensure he gets the best out of the trio.</p>

      <p>"I come to two conclusions. One, there are no senior players setting the standard and telling them what is required in a football team," he added.</p>
      <p>""The other big thing is they don't know or understand how to approach a Premier League away game.</p>
      <p>"There are a lot of good young players there but they need experienced players around them.</p>
      <p>"Who knows that they could become for the club but they don't know the game at all, particularly away from home."</p>
