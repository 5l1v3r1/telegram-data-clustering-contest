      <h1>The 'challenging' task of becoming a SA Hall of Famer</h1>

      <p>Cape Town - <b>The South African Hall of Fame</b> is one of the highest accolades any South African sports person can receive.</p>
      <p>During the Nedbank Golf Challenge two weekends ago,<b> Sport24</b> took a walk down to the <a href="https://www.halloffame.co.za/">SA Hall of Fame</a> at Sun Central at the Sun City Resort.</p>
      <p>The SA Hall of Fame is for all South Africans and looks to inspire and empower the youth, according to chairperson <b>Johnny Burger</b>.</p>
      <p>Since 1908, only <b>134</b> South Africans have been inducted into the Hall of Fame, with a large chunk of those associated with the sporting world. </p>
      <p>They include Gary Player, Joost van der Westhuizen, Bobby Locke, Penny Heyns, Sally Little, Lucas Radebe, Jomo Sono, Brian Mitchell, Jacob Matlala and Shaun Tomson.</p>
      <p>According to Burger, becoming a Hall of Famer is "not an easy task" and nominees need to get majority votes from an independent panel.</p>
      <p>"The nice thing about this is that our governance is in place, so we've got an independent panel so any government institution, sporting body or any individual can fill in a nomination form of who they think should be included in the South African Hall of Fame," Burger told <b>Sport24</b>.</p>
      <p>"That then goes to the independent panel, of which Hugh Bladen is chairperson. Out of the 10 on the panel, you've got to have 8 who agree that this individual becomes a Hall of Famer - only then will we do their induction.</p>
      <p>"To become a Hall of Famer is not an easy task as we've only got 134 Hall of Famers so far."</p>
      <p>According to Burger, the South African Hall of Fame is not a museum, but an interactive exhibition.</p>
      <p>"It's something that South Africa needs and has been wanting for a long time because we tend to remember politics, but what about our past heroes?" said Burger.</p>
      <p>"Who ever knew in 1908 a guy by the name of Reggie Walker won the 100m at the London Olympics in 10.8 seconds and became an Olympic champion?</p>
      <p>"We've got to preserve these remarkable achievements in order to bring a message of hope to our youth, who are sometimes in despair, so it's a good-feel initiative and a necessary initiative."</p>
