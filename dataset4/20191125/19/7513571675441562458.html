        <b>A medical report the National Correctional Service (NCS) presented to a federal high court in Abuja on Monday showed that Abdulrasheed Maina, former chairman of the Pension Reforms Task Force (PRTF), is fit to stand trial.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Maina had been using ill health as an excuse to delay his trial.</p>
      <p>On November 5, Okon Abang, the presiding judge, ordered the deputy comptroller of the NCS in charge of medicals and welfare to ascertain the true health status of the defendant.</p>
      <p>Maina, who is standing trial on allegations of money laundering, has frequently appeared in court with the aid of walking sick.</p>
      <p>He was wheeled into the court on November 7. On November 21, Francis Orasanye, his lawyer, informed the court that his client was bleeding from his nose.</p>
      <p>However, at the resumed trial on Monday, M.S. Abubakar, the prosecution counsel, informed the court that Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on November 20, 2019, received a comprehensive report on Maina’s medical status from the prison service.</p>
      <p>He said in the report signed by Remi Ojo, an assistant comptroller general (medical) of the service, only stated that Maina, 45 years old, has slight malaria and high blood pressure.</p>
      <p>The report said Maina was suffering from high blood pressure but it has been brought under control.</p>
      <p>“Maina vital organs are working normal. He is fit to stand trial.”</p>
      <p>Consequently, Okon Abang, the judge, ordered the prosecution to serve the defence team with the report.</p>
