      <h1>Asim Riaz bares heart for fellow housemate Himanshi Khurana, promises to protect her on Bigg Boss show</h1>

      <p>If the Monday episode of Bigg Boss sought to recreate the on-screen chemistry of Siddharth Shukla and Rashami Desai, another blossoming relationship is also in the offing. What appears to be catching the attention of housemates and the audience is the blooming romance between Asim Riaz and Himanshi Khurana. Both Asim and Himanshi were seen discussing their developing love for each other.</p>

      <p>The upcoming episode will see Himanshi and Asim express their feelings to each other. The promo shown by Colors TV has Himanshi saying to Asim, “Everyone is saying that you have strong feelings for me.” Asim seems to reply in the affirmative. Himanshi also reciprocates positively.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the show on Monday night, Asim was seen comforting Himanshi after she had a brief altercation with Siddharth. Asim pulled her out of a group and walked alongside her by putting his arm around her shoulder. He told her, “Your heart is of gold. What to do! You’ve come to this show. You have me here. Asim means protector.”</p>

      <p>Asim also sat down with Siddharth trying to remove the misconception that the latter had about Himanshi.</p>
      <p>Siddharth was later taking a swipe at Asim by saying that he was flying in the air because Asim was in love. At one point, Asim and Shefali were seen cosying up in bed as the former pretended to flirt with her.</p>
      <p>Himanshi had earlier addressed Asim as ‘my Asim’ prompting housemates such as Siddharth and Khesari Lal Yadav to tease her.</p>
