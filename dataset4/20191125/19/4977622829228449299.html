      <h1>Telangana: TSRTC Employees Call Off Strike After 52 Days; JAC Leader Asks Workers To Report For Duty Tomorrow</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:05:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:05</time> by <a rel="author">Swarajya Staff</a></address>
      <p>The employees of state-owned Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) called off their 52-day long strike on Monday (25 November).</p>
      <p>TSRTC Joint Action Committee (JAC) leader Ashwathama Reddy asked all the employees to report for duty from Tuesday. He appealed the temporary drivers, conductors and other staff not to report for duty as the regular employees have decided to end the strike.</p>
      <p>Nearly 50,000 employees were on strike since 5 October to press for various demands, including the demand to merge TSRTC with the government. About 1,500 employees later returned to duty following an appeal by Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Saturday, the employees had decided to continue their indefinite strike after the Telangana High Court on Friday dismissed a petition challenging the government's decision to privatise 5,100 TSRTC routes, thus allowing part privatisation of the state-owned transport utility.</p>
      <p>The protesting employees had said that their future course of action will depend on the state government's response to their offer of resuming work unconditionally.</p>
