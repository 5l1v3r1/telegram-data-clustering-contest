      <h1>REPORT: Philip Rivers Unlikely To Return To Chargers In 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:18:20+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:18</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Philip Rivers is having one of the worst years of his career in a season that began with high expectations due to what they accomplished during the 2018 season.</p>
      <p>With every loss, with every thrown interception, speculation continues to grow that the 2019 season will likely be his last with the franchise.</p>
      <p>There is a “very real chance” the Chargers could part ways with Rivers following the season, according to Jason La Canfora of CBS Sports.</p>
      <blockquote>“Multiple people in that organization say they expect the parting of the ways in 2020. You mention the age, the contract, they’ve had no contract talks. None are expected. Jim, you live in that area. They are marketing to Inglewood, fighting the Rams for that market. Philip lives in San Diego, hasn’t really embraced the move. That has grated on some people in that organization.”</blockquote>
      <p>As of right now, the Chargers don’t exactly have a plan in place to replace Rivers, with Tyrod Taylor currently serving as a backup and clearly not the answer at QB they need.</p>
      <p>If the team continues on their losing ways, they just might have a chance to get a QB in the 2020 NFL Draft.</p>
