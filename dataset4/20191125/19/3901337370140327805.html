      <p>Following his final-day heroics for FS Metta, young South African attacker, Kgotso Masangane, has been handed a major award by his club.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Masangane scored seven goals and got six assists in 30 games for the Latvian side as they successfully fended off relegation from the top-flight this season, including the opening goal in their crucial win over Super Nova in the second leg of their relegation playoff.</p>

      </p>
      <p>This time last year the 21-year-old was playing for FC Zone Mavo in the ABC Motsepe League, but has come a long way since then after he was named as Metta’s Player of the Season for his efforts in his debut campaign at the club.</p>
      <p>Having been voted as the club’s top player by their fans, Masangane was presented with his award at the end of season ceremony last week, bringing to an end a successful first stint in Europe following his move from South Africa earlier in the year.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Only one player in the side finished with more goals than the South African – Tamirlan Dzhamalutdinov with 10 – and just two players in the entire division managed to get more assists than he did.</p>
