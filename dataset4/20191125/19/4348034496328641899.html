      <p>This Friday (November 29), the Griselda Records trio of Westside Gunn, Conway The Machine, and Benny The Butcher are releasing their full-length Shady Records debut, <i>WWCD (What Would Chine Do)</i>. Following the release of <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/10/griselda-benny-conway-westside-shady-song/">“Dr. Bird’s”</a> and “Chef Dreds” (embedded below), the trio of Buffalo, New York MCs have released an album trailer.</p>
      <p>The video copy confirms that Shady founder Eminem will appear. Previously, he supported Conway on summertime single <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/07/eminem-conway-the-machine-griselda-bang/">“Bang,”</a> which is reportedly attached to The Machine’s upcoming Shady solo LP, <i>God Don’t Make</i> <i>Mistakes</i> LP. Moreover, 2000s Shady Records’ superstar 50 Cent will appear with the trio of MCs. Wu-Tang Clan’s Raekwon is another confirmed guest. Rae’ has been an early supporter of Griselda, working on this summer’s <i><a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/07/westside-gunn-flygod-awesome-album-highlights/">Flygod Is An Awesome God</a></i>.</p>

      <p>“I don’t have to change for nobody. If you don’t f*ck with this, just don’t f*ck with this. I make music for a certain kind of people,” Wes’ says in the trailer. “Griselda is just built off of respect.” Core producer Daringer describes the label and collective’s sound as “grimy.” “You know they about to love this sh*t; it’s a f*ckin’ show,” touts Benny, who made <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5So31JibrTO74WvuCozsAb?si=SSw7wc0NTSKEZ5CC58MM9A"><i>The Plugs I Met</i></a> earlier this year as well as the Pete Rock-produced <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1Qvqt0A3WA27QScCFwBDRY?si=8WUd5sqQTiyATkM4OAV71w"><i>Statue Of Limitations </i></a>with Smoke DZA last month. “We did like five joints yesterday, and I didn’t write a word. I just rolled a blunt; by the time I was done, I was ready to go lock-in. That’s that feeling—that type of vibe it provides. Like ‘Okay, we’re all together, in the same studio, on the same page, makin’ this crazy-ass project we ’bout to drop,” boasts Conway, fresh off of his <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7wZmVoR11jHhE9PzZbc100?si=y9bsRR9pSx-TyPn-f0zqPQ"><i>Eif 3 </i></a>campaign.</p>
