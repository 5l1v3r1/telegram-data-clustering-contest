      <p>Got your eye on the new <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-unveils-new-16-inch-macbook-pro/">16-inch MacBook Pro</a>? Or maybe you already have a MacBook or MacBook Pro that's serving you well. Of maybe you aren't a macOS user and instead have a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/next-for-windows-10-what-to-expect-from-the-april-2019-update-aka-version-1903/">Windows 10</a> or even <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/10-super-sweet-laptops-that-come-with-linux-pre-installed/">Linux laptop</a>.</p>
      <p>No matter what platform your run, if you own a USB-C laptop, you need to buy this cheap $25 accessory. Why? Because it could save your laptop.<br/><br/>So, what is this accessory? It's a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-HOGORE-Converter-Charging-Compatible/dp/B07NPNYCBG/?tag=zdnet-deals-20">20-pin USB-C magnetic breakaway connector</a> that acts like the old MagSafe connector.<br/><br/>The connector is a standard USB-C type connector that is attached to a dongle using a magnet. The magnet is strong enough to keep the connector together but will allow the connector to separate if the cable is given a tug that is strong enough to take the laptop on a journey groundwards.<br/><br/>The connector is rated for 100W (20V/5A) power transfer, which is what I use if for, but it is also good for data and can support a throughput of 10Gbps, and can support 4K@30Hz video output.</p>
      <p><b>Must read: </b><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/volta-xl-a-cable-that-can-stop-you-destroying-your-precious-macbook/"><b>Volta XL: A cable that can stop you destroying your precious MacBook</b></a><br/><br/>Usage is simple -- plug the USB-C connector into the laptop, and connect your USB-C charge cable to the breakaway part of the assembly, and you are ready to go.</p>
      <p>Given the price of high-end USB-C laptops, $25 is a small price to pay for a little insurance against dragging the laptop to the floor via the cable.</p>
