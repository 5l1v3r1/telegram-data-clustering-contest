        <i>Question: Like many parents, I’m afraid of giving my toddler too much access to electronics. What is the best way to limit screen time for my young child?</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/screen-time">Screen time</a> is a controversial topic among parents today.</p>
      <p>The latest generations of children have grown up with smartphones, tablets, and TV being part of their daily lives.</p>
      <p>There are tons of differing opinions about how much screen time is too much – and what age is too young for kids to start using devices.</p>
      <p>Some parents feel strongly about limiting, or even prohibiting, screen time, while others believe exposure is inevitable and choose to introduce screens to their children early on. And of course, some fall somewhere in between.</p>
      <h3>The truth is, we are still in the early stages of figuring this out.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/health/screen-time-kids-psychology.html">A National Institutes of Health study</a> suggests that young iPad junkies may be at risk for lower scores on some aptitude tests, and other research is showing that high exposure to screens can lead to children’s brains <a href="https://www.insider.com/high-screen-time-use-kids-linked-to-lower-brain-development-2019-11">developing in subtly different ways</a>.</p>
      <p>It is important to know, however, that these results are far from conclusive. We do see how screens can be addictive to adult brains, so it is reasonable to assume that less is more when it comes to kids, too. Don’t hesitate to toss out your TV if you want to do it on general principle, but we’ve got more work to do to better understand which kids are at risk from too much time staring at the iPad or boob tube.</p>
      <h3>There are three key ideas all parents need to recognize.</h3>
      <p>But before we talk about screens, there are three key ideas all parents need to recognize.</p>
      <p>First, many of you deserve a huge round of applause for doing this demanding (yet delightful) job without the help of a huge extended family, as was the norm throughout the entire history of humanity. So don’t judge yourself too harshly for the daily use of a little bit of digital babysitting.</p>
      <p>Second: Get outside! Nature and fresh air, running around at the park, and playing with other kids are among the most nurturing things we can do with our children.</p>
      <p>And third, if you can, <a href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2018/02/power-pets">get a pet</a>. If you don’t have other kids, you can at least fill a little of the social void by giving your child a pet dog or cat that will give them hours and hours of fun and friendship.</p>
      <h3>Remember, your family is unique. It’s OK to have flexible rules.</h3>
      <p>Now, regarding screens, <a href="https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/American-Academy-of-Pediatrics-Announces-New-Recommendations-for-Childrens-Media-Use.aspx">the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends</a> skipping them for kids under 18 months. Over that age, they can watch non-violent nature shows and well-produced programming, like “Sesame Street.” From 2 to 5 years, the AAP recommends under one hour a day of similar high-value shows.</p>
      <p>But, like all general guidelines, these are meant to be broken from time to time. Your family is unique. An even better parenting rule is that it’s good to have flexible plans and not be overly committed to rigid rules.</p>
      <p>What scientists have definitely proven is that speaking, reading, and singing are nourishing to a child’s developing brain. So enjoy entertaining your tyke with books and songs, poems, and even little stories about you as a little kid (your child will love to hear it again and again!).</p>
      <p>And when you do allow screen time, <a href="https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/American-Academy-of-Pediatrics-Announces-New-Recommendations-for-Childrens-Media-Use.aspx">watch some of it with your child</a> and enrich the experience with brief pauses to ask questions, have a discussion, or do a little role-playing.</p>
