      <h1>Baylor football: Matt Rhule says QB Charlie Brewer is fine</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Berry Tramel</a></address>
      <p>Baylor quarterback Charlie Brewer suffered a hard hit in the fourth quarter against Texas on Saturday and didn’t return to the game, but Bears coach Matt Rhule said Monday that Brewer is fine and that his injury was ankle-related.</p>
      <p>“He’s good,” Brewer said Monday on the Big 12 football teleconference. “He probably could have come back in the game. But it was smart to keep him out. Really good opportunity to play Gary (Bohanan, the backup).”</p>
      <p>Brewer appear to be shaken up from the hit in the head area, but Rhule said Brewer suffered a rolled ankle.</p>
      <p>“Kind of gimpy on Saturday but saw him this morning, looks good. Looked good last night. I think he’ll be ready to roll.”</p>
      <p>Baylor hosts Kansas on Saturday, then plays OU in the Big 12 Championship Game in Arlington on December 7.</p>
