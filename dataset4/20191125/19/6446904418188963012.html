      <p>AT LEAST SEVEN people have died as heavy rain hit the Riviera coasts of France and Italy, trapping travellers in their cars, as well as parts of western Greece.</p>
      <p>Some roads remained closed today on the French Riviera, and rivers were still rising in Italy after the weekend flooding.</p>
      <p>The administration for France’s Var region said four people died, including a couple in their 70s whose car got submerged.</p>
      <p>Another died after a French rescue boat sank in the Mediterranean and another was found dead in a car.</p>
      <p>In Greece, the bodies of the two men believed to be tourists were recovered late last night and early this morning near the port of Antirio, 155 miles west of Athens after a sailboat they were using was caught in the severe weather.</p>
      <p>In northern Italy, a woman was found dead after the Bomida river swept away her car.</p>
      <p>Rescuers are also searching for possible victims after a landslide caused the collapse of a stretch of an elevated road near the flooded city of Savona.</p>
      <p>Firefighter commander Emanuele Gizzi told SKY TG24 on Monday that “we still don’t have the certainty that there is absolutely no one” missing.</p>
      <p>Drivers who witnessed the collapse were able to stop in time. There were no reports of witnesses seeing vehicles fall with the roadway, but the search continued as a precaution.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the level of the Ticino River in the Lombard city of Pavia was continuing to rise, flooding streets by about 15 cm and forcing some residents to evacuate.</p>
      <p>In France, rivers started receding slowly but many families who evacuated still could not return home. Authorities worked to restore electricity and clear roads of fallen trees and mud.</p>
      <p>In Greece, hundreds of homes were flooded following an overnight storm that affected areas west of Athens.</p>
      <p>Torrential rain and mudslides caused the closure of the road linking the Greek capital to the western port city of Patras.</p>
      <p>The worst flooding occurred at the seaside resort of Kineta, where mudslides came from a nearby forest fire-damaged hillside.</p>
      <p>Several dozen people trapped in their cars and in flooded homes were rescued by the fire service.</p>
