      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/music-declares-emergency-savages-fay-milton-interview-2559242">NME recently spoke to Fay Milton about the organisation</a> and what the music industry can do to combat climate change.</p>
      <p>“There’s such a short period of time to make the changes we need to make, and to make people wake up and realise that there isn’t time for everyone to change everything they do,” she said.</p>
      <p>“To use Greta Thunberg’s analogy, the house is on fire, and there isn’t time for whoever started the fire with their cigarette to quit smoking before saying the house is on fire – it’s on fire now, and we need to fix this. Let’s change our lifestyles, let’s fly less, let’s use less plastic – but ultimately what’s needed is a governmental response,” Milton said.</p>
      <p>Last night, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/finneas-teases-experimental-second-album-billie-eilish-2571434#QO8sCD50QSKpOotW.99">Eilish’s brother and frequent collaborator Finneas also teased that the singer’s second album will see her heading in an “experimental” new direction.</a></p>
      <p>The producer, real name Finneas O’Connor, explained that the follow-up to 2019’s ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/billie-eilish-album-review-when-we-all-fall-asleep-where-do-we-go">When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</a>‘ will allow the singer to “evolve” her sound.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/8544683/finneas-video-interview-2019-amas">told <i>Billboard</i></a> at the American Music Awards: “I think so far, in album two…there’s just a lot of stories we felt we didn’t get to tell yet.</p>
      <p>“We’re just trying to tell all those and we’re being a little bit experimental. I think if you’re not trying to change things a little bit, you’re not evolving. So I think we’re just trying to embrace everything that we are proud of in our music and also just try new things and experiment and give people stuff to look forward to.”</p>
