      <h1>In This ‘Wolf of Wall Street,’ You’re Part of the Debauchery</h1>

      <p>LONDON — The office buildings around Liverpool Street in Shoreditch here are generally known for housing investment bankers and financial professionals. Over the last few months, a new occupant in the neighborhood has been racking up trades, though some are most certainly illegal. That would be Jordan Belfort, the disgraced 1990s stockbroker canonized by Leonardo DiCaprio in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iszwuX1AK6A">2013 film “The Wolf of Wall Street,”</a> Martin Scorsese’s biggest international box office success to date.</p>
      <p>A hotel in the middle of construction on Sun Street serves as the home for an immersive stage production of <a href="https://immersivewolf.com/event/the-wolf-of-wall-street">“The Wolf of Wall Street,”</a> opening soon after a rocky period of previews. Scheduled to run through January, it is not adapted from Scorsese’s film, but rather from three of Belfort’s books, including his first memoir and a follow-up self-help volume, which capitalized on the success of the film. (Now 57, he works as a motivational speaker and sales instructor. )</p>
      <p>The theater piece, which spans four floors and 25 rooms, is the creation of Alexander Wright, a 31-year-old writer and director. He is perhaps best known for a long-running London production of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/dec/21/the-great-gatsby-review-guild-of-misrule-fancy-dress-party">“The Great Gatsby,”</a> staged as if a party at Jay Gatsby’s mansion.</p>
      <p>Originally presented in a pub in Wright’s hometown, York, in 2015, “Gatsby” has since held over a thousand performances around the world. In mid-October, it moved to <a href="http://www.immersiveldn.com/">Immersive LDN,</a> a new West End space devoted solely to choose-your-own-adventure work.</p>
      <p>Wright started to make immersive theater with friends at the University of York, “because we were bored of sitting in the dark with people, and we were 19 and didn’t know any better.” Now immersive theater is fashionable and popular in Britain. <a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/theatre/mamma-mia-the-party-review">“Mamma Mia! The Party,”</a> a kind of “Tony n’ Tina’s Wedding” set on a Greek island to an Abba soundtrack, opened this fall at the O2, an entertainment complex in Southeast London.</p>
      <p>“We’re always looking for a good story to tell that becomes better if you put an audience in the middle of it,” Wright said. “And to do this in the banking district is really exciting.”</p>
      <p>The idea to adapt “The Wolf of Wall Street” actually came from one of Wright’s regular creative partners, Brian Hook, 31. Not having seen the Scorsese picture, he read Belfort’s book by happenstance.</p>
      <p>“I was stunned by how abhorrent and honest it was,” said Hook. He saw it in the continuum of traditional theater pieces about the temptations and pitfalls of economics, business and greed, including David Mamet’s “Glengarry Glen Ross,” Lucy Prebble’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/theater/reviews/28enron.html?module=inline">“Enron”</a> (a hit in London that had a brief Broadway run), and more recently, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/theater/the-lehman-trilogy-review-sam-mendes.html?searchResultPosition=3&amp;module=inline">“The Lehman Trilogy,”</a> which will return to New York next spring.</p>
      <p>“I could see this world in front of me and I could see how our form could be really important to telling and exploring those stories,” said Hook.</p>
      <p>Wright, Hook and Hook’s producing partner, Louis Harshorn, met with Belfort in 2017. He suggested they adapt “Wolf” into a stage musical. (Despite several requests, Belfort declined an interview.) But the trio explained that they felt an immersive dip into his universe was a better way in.</p>
      <p>“He really got it, and we kind of did the deal there and then,” recalled Hook.</p>
      <p>Then Wright had to figure out how to stage it. An impish figure in a black bowler hat and red sneakers, Wright once developed a site-specific “Romeo and Juliet” that unfolded over 36 hours at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. With this new project, he said he began by “storyboarding the dominant narratives.”</p>
      <p>There was Belfort’s story; the story of how the F.B.I. caught him; and many smaller moments in between. “After that, you start to join the dots,” he explained.</p>
      <p>During an early rehearsal, a huge wall of the green room in the hotel-turned-theater was devoted to color-coded note cards featuring the main movable “beats” in the show.</p>
      <p>Though Wright’s “Wolf of Wall Street” tells Belfort’s narrative chronologically in just over two hours, it actually encompasses 30 hours of content in total, staged vertically and horizontally over the various rooms and floors of the space. The script, Wright said, runs 700 pages.</p>
      <p>Tickets start at 60 pounds (about $77) and as many as 300 guests a night enter as first-day employees at Stratton Oakmont, Belfort’s former firm. “They’re new fish,” said Wright.</p>
      <p>After that, “there’s no set journey. It’s about who you make pals with and who you follow,” he explained. With one actor for every 16 audience members, “most everyone is guaranteed an individual narrative.”</p>

      <p>The show focuses more on the pull of debauchery than on actual sex, drugs and alcohol, though there are plenty of places to purchase a cocktail.</p>
      <p>Stops include a noodle bar; a small pool; a disco; Belfort’s kitchen and living room; an entire floor devoted to the F.B.I. investigation; Swiss passport control; and the Stratton Oakmont trading floor/office, which involved installing white desks, ’90s retro phones and wall-to-wall carpet in the hotel basement.</p>
      <p>Oh, and a trampoline — should any actor choose to mark a particularly energetic trade with a celebratory leap.</p>
      <p>Construction delays and cast illness led to more than a few hiccups, with performances postponed several times. An official press night for critics is now planned for later this week; early internet reports have been mixed. <a href="https://twitter.com/Syann_Cox/status/1178234731751759873?s=20">“Was ripping us off the ultimate immersion?”</a> wrote one attendee, while another maintained, <a href="https://twitter.com/YannSicamois/status/1177181300484116480?s=20">“I had the time of my life.”</a></p>
      <p>Wright said that Brexit and Britain’s uncertain economic future make Belfort’s story especially resonant. Putting the audience in the middle of it forces them to be complicit in the character’s “ruthless and reckless decisions” and asks them to confront their own feelings about money in 2019, he explained.</p>
      <p>“You kind of have to remind yourself of the scale of this fraud and the people it has affected,” added Hook, who hopes to bring this “Wolf of Wall Street” to New York.</p>
      <p>“It’s a gorgeous story to tell, but it’s not a gorgeous story,” he said. “It’s a love story with money where the money doesn’t reciprocate.”</p>
