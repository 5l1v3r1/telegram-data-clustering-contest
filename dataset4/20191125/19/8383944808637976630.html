      <p>An 82-year-old bodybuilder from New York smashed a table over a man who tried to break into her home Thursday night, U.S. media outlets reported.</p>
      <p>According to reports, Willie Murphy was about to sleep at around 11 p.m. when a home invader started to pound at her door. As the woman opened the door, the man said he was sick, asking to call an ambulance for him.</p>
      <p>Murphy refused to let the stranger into her house and called the police, but the man continued to hit the door, broke it and entered the house.</p>
      <p>The woman hid in the dark and as the man passed by she picked up a table and brought it down on him, hitting the man until the table broke. Murphy kept hitting him with one of the metal legs as he fell to the floor.</p>
      <p>After that, the woman poured a bottle of baby shampoo over the man's head and then hit him with a broom as he fell unconscious.</p>
      <p>"It's kind of semi-dark and I'm alone, and I'm old. But guess what, I'm tough," she said. "He picked the wrong house to break into."</p>
      <p>Police later arrived at the scene in response to the woman's call.</p>
      <p>Murphy started powerlifting in 2008 and began hitting the gym multiple times a week. As she began competing, the World Natural Powerlifting Federation (WNPF) had to create a new category for octogenarian lifters.</p>
      <p>In 2014 the WNPF named Murphy its Lifter of the Year.</p>
