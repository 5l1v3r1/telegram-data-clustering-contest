      <p><b>Jennifer Aniston</b> is not “falling apart” amid an alleged midlife crisis, despite a completely false tabloid report. The very dramatic story is filled with talk of medical issues and meltdowns, but none of it is true. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can set the record straight.</p>
      <p>Aniston is featured on the cover of this week’s <i><b>NW</b></i> in a story about the actress suffering all sorts of physical and mental problems as a result of stress and aging. The article kicks off by claiming the actress is panicking over the planned <i>Friends</i> reunion on HBO Max. The reason? The 50-year-old is allegedly worried about looking old on the special.</p>
      <p>“Jen would never get anything extreme or drastic done – she’s a firm believer in getting little nips and tucks here and there that, no one really notices,” an anonymous source tells the outlet. “But high-definition TV is a whole new thing for her. The pressure of always looking her best and putting on a brave face seems to be getting too much for Jen.”</p>
      <p>From there, the supposed tipster says the “grueling hours” filming her Apple TV+ series <i>The Morning Show</i> “have taken years off her life,” adding, “Some days she can’t get out of bed – it’s like her whole body has broken down. Other days she just collapses from exhaustion or bursts into tears.”</p>
      <p>The unknown insider goes on to say that medics were recently called to Aniston’s home during an unexplained medical issue. “She’s had all sorts of doctors make house calls, since she’s basically bedridden a lot of the time,” adds the questionable source. “No one’s been able to figure out what’s medically wrong with her other than pure exhaustion, which is super concerning.”</p>
      <p>The seemingly phony source further contends that Aniston “can’t stand looking in the mirror without makeup” and is “convinced she looks like a haggard 60-year-old and no one’s been able to convince her otherwise.” The unidentified insider concludes, “Her assistants spend most of their time coordinating Jen’s diary around her beauty and surgery appointments and her nap times, which these days can strike up at any time. She’s in full existential crisis mode.”</p>
      <p>Nothing about the tabloid’s over-the-top report is remotely true. For starters, <a href="https://www.instyle.com/celebrity/jennifer-aniston-october-2019-cover-story">Aniston spoke about turning 50 in her cover story for the October 2019 issue of <i>InStyle</i></a>. The actress made it clear she doesn’t “feel any different” since reaching the milestone age. “Things aren’t shutting down in any way,” the actress stressed. “I feel physically incredible. So it’s weird that it’s all of a sudden getting telegraphed in a way that’s like, ‘You look amazing for your age.’ I think we need to establish some etiquette around that dialogue and verbiage.” It should be noted, the headline of that article read, “Jennifer Aniston Has Found Her Power.” The actress isn’t having any sort of midlife crisis.</p>
      <p>The idea that Aniston is suffering from all sorts of health issues is baseless. The actress spent the past few months on her promotional tour for <i>The Morning Show</i>, and has several more projects lined up. If she were truly experiencing such “exhaustion,” carrying out these professional duties would be impossible. In reality, the actress enjoys staying busy and loves her work.</p>
      <p>Still, <b>Gossip Cop</b> ran <i>NW</i>’s article by Aniston’s spokesperson, who tells us on the record that “all of it is nonsense.” As for medics visiting the actress’s home, we’re told the incident “never happened.” Aniston is happy and healthy, so this idea otherwise is really coming out of left field.</p>
      <p>It’s possible the tabloid is targeting the actress’s health because it’s been so wrong about her love life. In October, <b>Gossip Cop</b> called out the magazine for falsely claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/jennifer-aniston-jon-hamm-dating/">Aniston was dating Jon Hamm</a>. In August, the outlet insisted <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/jennifer-aniston-dating-billionaire/">Aniston was secretly dating a mystery multi-billionaire</a>. Neither of those phony scenarios are mentioned in the publication’s latest piece. The tabloid has zero insight into any aspect of Aniston’s personal life.</p>
