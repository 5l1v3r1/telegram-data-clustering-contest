      <p>In their post, 7-Eleven displayed a picture of the alluring treat with the caption, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve tried cookie-flavoured cake, but have you tried cake-flavoured cookies? The hype is here!‚Äù</p>
      <p>Today at the WORLD OF BUZZ headquarters, we finally got to try these attractive festive cookies to let you know if it is worth your RM3.60.</p>

      <p>PSA: If you‚Äôre looking for an exact replica of a red velvet cake but in cookie form, you won‚Äôt find it in this Oreo. While there is that distinct tangy and slightly salty flavour of cream cheese sandwiched in between two average tasting Oreo cookies, the red velvet flavour is definitely lacking.</p>

      <p>The cookies without the filing just tastes like every other Oreo. And while that isn‚Äôt necessarily bad, it isn‚Äôt <i>that</i> special either.</p>
      <p>However, if you‚Äôre looking for the familiar taste of your favourite Oreo cookies with a little cream cheese twist, these limited edition treats are definitely worth a taste. Plus, for RM3.60? That‚Äôs a pretty good deal for some seasonal Oreos.</p>
