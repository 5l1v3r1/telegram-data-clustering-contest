      <p>Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu has said his administration had started taking steps towards building a new orientation camp for the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Lagos State to accommodate the large number of corps members sent to the state.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the closing of the Batch C Stream 1 Orientation programme Monday, Sanwo-Olu, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Relations, said:</p>
      <p>“I wish to put on record that this administration is very conscious of the increasing number of corps members deployed to Lagos State, hence we are putting in place all measures towards the construction of a befitting permanent orientation camp that can accommodate the large number of corps members deployed to the centre of excellence.”</p>

      <p>Sanwo-Olu also urged organisations where the 2,540 corps members would be posted to accept them and take care of their welfare while the service year lasts.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the Governor’s speech, the Lagos State NYSC Coordinator, Mr Sunday Aroni, said in an interview that he was glad of the reference to the new camp – evidence that something is in the works.</p>
      <p>In his speech, Aroni counseled the corps members to be of good behaviour throughout their service year.</p>
      <p>“It is important to warn you to desist from acts that are capable of denting the image of the scheme and by extension, your families. I encourage you to be agents of change and be good ambassadors in your places of primary assignment. Lead by example and always let ‘Service and Humility’ be your watch word,” he said.</p>
