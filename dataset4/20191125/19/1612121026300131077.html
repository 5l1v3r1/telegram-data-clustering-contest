      <p>Disney+ had a <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346306-disney-plus-launch-issues/">pretty rocky launch</a>, but Disney seems to have gotten things under control and now they’re working on getting the app up to snuff. They’re adding in some things that probably should’ve been available right away, but hey, better late than never, right?</p>
      <p>One of the biggest changes includes the ability for Disney+ to remember you left off when you were last watching. If you’re going through a series, now you’ll be able to jump into the next unwatched episode instead of having to manually go figure out where you were. Again, seems like it should be a basic addition already, but we’re glad it’s here.</p>

          </i>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>There’s also a new watchlist feature so you can queue up things you want to watch later instead of just trying to remember. That’s also almost a necessity considering the sheer amount of back content is in the Disney catalog.</p>
      <p>Disney will undoubtedly keep adding things to their platform to really make it a <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/339113-disneys-netflix-killer-is-coming-later-this-year-and-its-cheap/">true Netflix competitor</a>. This is a small start, but a good one.</p>
