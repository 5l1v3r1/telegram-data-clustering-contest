          <b>This Friday will see the vast majority of the country gather around the telly for one of the great Irish annual traditions; <i>The Late Late Toy Show</i>.</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>However, those who plan to avoid RTE and Ryan Tubridy on Friday evening,<i> The Graham Norton Show</i> might be a decent alternative, with the long-running BBC chat show boasting another stellar line-up this week.</p>
      <p>Joining the Irish TV presenter this week is former First Lady of the United States and US State Secretary <b>Hillary Clinton</b> and her daughter, <b>Chelsea</b>.</p>
      <p>Hillary will be discussing losing the 2016 US election to Donald Trump and what she has been up to since, which includes penning a new book, <i>The Book of Gutsy Women,</i> alongside her daughter Chelsea. The book is filled with portraits of "gutsy women" including Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Mary Ritter Beard, Harriet Tubman, Edith Windsor, and Malala Yousafzai. In many cases, the authors describe how the subjects influenced their lives and in some cases how they met them.</p>

      <p>Also set to appear on Friday's episode is chef<b> Jamie Oliver</b>, who has launched a new mid-range restaurant chain<b> </b>just six months after his UK dining empire collapsed. The Essex-born TV star and cook has also launched a new cookbook, Veg, which is full of plant-powered recipes,  and is accompanied by a new show, <i>Jamie's Meat-Free Meals. </i></p>
      <p>Rounding out the guest list is comedian and Peep Show star, <b>David Mitchell.</b> Mitchell, who can be seen on TV as team captain on the British panel show <i>Would I Lie To You?</i>, is releasing a new book, 'Dishonesty Is The Second-Best Policy', a collection of his columns written for the Observer between 2015 and 2019, tackling a plethora of subjects, from politics, the Olympics and terrorism, to rude street names, exercise and the commercialisation of Christmas.</p>
      <p>Music on the night comes from <b>Kesha</b>, who will be performing her current single, 'Raising Hell'.</p>
      <p>
        <i>
          <b>The Graham Norton Show airs every Friday on BBC One at 10.40pm. </b>
        </i>
