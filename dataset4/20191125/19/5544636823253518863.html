      <p>The Federal Government has noted that the closure of the country’s land borders has helped in improving security among other things.</p>
      <p>Concise News reports that the Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed said this on Monday at Seme, a border town between Nigeria and the Benin Republic.</p>
      <p>He was among the Federal Government delegation on inspection and assessment of the effect of the border closure.</p>
      <p>Speaking during the inspection, the Minister noted that over 296 illegal immigrants had been arrested due to the border closure.</p>
      <p>“In the area of security, the ongoing exercise has recorded a number of seizures and arrests that would have had grave security consequences,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Some items seized include; 38,743-50kg bags of parboiled foreign rice, 514 vehicles, 1,012 drums filled with PMS, 5,400 Jerri cans of vegetable oil, 346 motorcycles, 10, 553 Jerri cans of PMS and 136 bags of NPK fertilizer used for making explosives.</p>
      <p>“The estimated values of the apprehended items is about ₦3,5 billion.”</p>
      <p>This is as he added: “Our series of interactions and engagements with Rice Miller Association of Nigeria since the commencement of this exercise, has shown that the border closure has enhanced more production and milling of Nigerian rice.</p>
      <p>“Patronage of Nigerian rice has increased and farmers are expanding their farms as well as engaging more hands.</p>
      <p>“The border exercise has also curbed the diversion of petroleum products from Nigeria to neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p>“Furthermore, the border closure has impacted positively on revenue generation of the Federal Government which in turn will be used to build more infrastructure and develop critical sectors of the nation’s economy.”</p>
      <p>According to him, “the arms and ammunition these terrorists and criminal elements were using no longer gain access into the country.</p>
      <p>“In addition, the drugs which affect the health and the wellbeing of Nigerians have equally been reduced.”</p>
