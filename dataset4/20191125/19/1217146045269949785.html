      <p>As part of its Enhanced Tracking Protection feature, Mozilla is planning on blocking Fingerprinters by default in Firefox 72, which is slated to be released in January 2020.</p>
      <p>Fingerprinters are a tracking method that allows a company to track you based on characteristics of your computer rather than through tracking cookies.</p>
      <p>It does this by building a profile of your device based on its characteristics such as the screen resolution, the browser you use, timezone, language, installed extensions, the installed fonts, and your operating system.</p>
      <p>All of this information is compiled into a unique fingerprint that can be used to track you through the different sites you visit on the Internet.</p>
      <p>Starting with Firefox 72, the browser will automatically block Fingerprinters on any sites that you visit through its Enhanced Tracking Protection feature.</p>
