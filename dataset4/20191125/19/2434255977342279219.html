      <p>I'm not normally the most glamorous of gals, but late November/early December is a time of year when I allow myself to go all out.</p>
      <p>I buy myself a new party dress or two, get my hair done, and most importantly - I get a facial.</p>
      <p>I love trying different types, so when I heard about the Diamond Facial offered by Juliette Armand, I was very excited.</p>
      <p>I headed out to <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/dublin">Kimmage</a> for my appointment, which kicked off with a cleanse, followed by a light peel to get rid of all my dead skin cells.</p>
      <p>A face, neck, shoulder and hand massage was included in the treatment, leaving me totally relaxed - I never knew I carried so much tension in my cheeks!</p>

      <p>My skin was pretty dehydrated from the cold weather (OK OK, and not moisturising well enough) so a hyaluronic acid serum was then applied.</p>
      <p>The serum contains MMW for long term hydration, protection against adverse environmental conditions and improved skin texture, LMW for instant hydration, UV protection and regulation of excess oiliness, and XS for reducing water loss, improving elasticity and helping with the reduction of wrinkles.</p>
      <p>Finally, la pièce de résistance - the Diamond Glow Mask, which contains synthetic diamond powder and 32 active ingredients.</p>
      <p>Applied in the form of a gauze for about half an hour, the mask contains vitamins A, C and E which brighten the complexion and fight free radicals.</p>

      <p>It's also packed with Gatuline to inhibit the movement of facial muscles - who needs cosmetic surgery, eh?</p>
      <p>Coming out of the salon, my skin was purified, moisturised and absolutely glowing.</p>
      <p>I'm now Christmas party ready!</p>
