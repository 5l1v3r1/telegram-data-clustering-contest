      <p>Anthony Joshua wants the world to bow at his feet, if he reclaims his heavyweight boxing title next month.</p>
      <p>The 2012 Olympic gold medallist is set for a rematch with Andy Ruiz Jnr in Saudi Arabia for the WBO, IBF and WBA titles on December 8.</p>
      <p>Mexican-American Ruiz shocked the boxing world in June, when he inflicted Joshua's first loss, <a href="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/sport/2019/06/boxing-anthony-joshua-v-andy-ruiz-jr-live-updates.html">knocking him out at New York's Madison Square Garden</a>. </p>
      <p>But the Britsh power-puncher, who scored the first knockdown of the fight in the third round, promises to end the short title reign of the unfancied champion - and when he does, he wants his peers to show him the respect he deserves. </p>
      <p>"I'm going to whoop him and show him how great I am," Joshua told Sky Sports UK.</p>
      <p>"Everyone is saying how great Andy Ruiz is, so when I beat him, I want everybody to bow to my feet and tell me how great I am. </p>
      <p>"I was supposed to beat this guy last time - a foregone conclusion they said. Now he's been built up like King Kong - the quickest hands in the division and the best boxer in the division. "When I beat him, that makes me the best."</p>

      <p>Joshua admits he got caught up in his own hype in June - his first venture to the United States market. The 30-year-old spent most of the lead-up to the Ruiz fight in front of a camera, promoting himself as sports newest superstar. </p>
      <p>But he has gone back to his roots to fix the mistakes he made in New York.</p>
      <p>"There is no legacy that you join - you create your own legacy. </p>
      <p>"I understood, when I came into the sport, that you have to create a show, but the second I lost that fight, I knew I had to come back to my fundamentals, because there was a little crack in the foundation.</p>
      <p>"So rather than flaunt and promote the show, I've been all about getting down and fixing those cracks in the building - that's my focus. </p>
      <p>"History shows you how you deal with those testing moments of your life and I'm blessed to have this second opportunity. </p>
      <p>"I'm not a broken man. I'm still here talking to you - right here, right now - so the loss hasn't affected me in that sense."</p>
      <p>Joshua refuses to look past Ruiz again, but has ruled out a potential unification fight with WBC champion Deontay Wilder.</p>
      <p>The undefeated American scored the 40th knockout of his career on Sunday, when he stopped Luis Ortiz in the seventh round of their WBC title fight in Las Vegas. </p>
      <p>The two best knockout artists in the heavyweight division have come close to a deal several times in the last two years, but issues - including money, location and rematch clauses - have scrapped these plans.</p>
      <p>Genuine animosity exists between both camps and Joshua is done talking about a unification fight if he reclaims his titles, refusing to entertain a 2020 matchup with the 'Bronze Bomber'.</p>
      <p>But Wilder isn't concerned, believing Joshua has little chance against his stablemate.</p>
      <p>"I believe Andy will go in there and do it again. Andy Ruiz will win that fight easily and then we will have the opportunity to unify the division next year.</p>
      <p>"There isn't anything different that Joshua can bring to the table than what we saw in New York - he's the same every time.</p>
      <p>"Joshua has already stated he has no interest in fighting me and that's not what the fans want to hear. I want one face, one name and one champion."</p>
      <p>Wilder will defend his WBC title against Tyson Fury in February. </p>
