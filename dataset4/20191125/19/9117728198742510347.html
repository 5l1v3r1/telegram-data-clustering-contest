        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> team principal Andreas Seidl has had a terrific driver in <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/carlos-sainz">Carlos Sainz</a> all season, and the German has revealed how impressive the 25-year-old's knowledge is about the technical side of F1.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After an unlucky start to 2019, Sainz has been the best driver in midfield for the bulk of the year, often leading the charge behind the top three teams as the Woking-based side had their best season in the turbo-hybrid era.</p>

      <p>Sainz has been the leader for the team as he's still very much in the fight to finish sixth in the drivers' championship. Seidl is a proud boss as he sheds light on the Spaniard's intelligence during meetings.</p>
      <p><i>"When I think of Carlos, it's impressive when he talks in meetings, he does it like he's an engineer, it's what it's like," </i>the team principal told <i>AS</i>.</p>
      <p><i>"He is very precise </i>[in his feedback]<i>, and that's good. Carlos has seen different teams and cars and that means he's very experienced working with different organisations and engineers.</i></p>

        <i>For me, it's very, very important how a driver works with the engineers and that he's clear with his comments and needs."</i>
