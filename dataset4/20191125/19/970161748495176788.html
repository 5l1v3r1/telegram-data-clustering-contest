      <p>A Jewish man who suffered anti-Semitic abuse while travelling on the London Underground has been reunited with the brave <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/muslim/">Muslim</a> woman who stepped in to defend him and his family.</p>
      <p>The man, who does not wish to be named, earlier said he was ‘extremely grateful’ for Asma Shuweikh’s intervention during the incident on the Northern Line last Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Without it, he added, the abuse ‘could have escalated to physical violence’.</p>
      <p>He finally got to express his thanks in person on Monday as he and Ms Shuweikh, 36, from Birmingham, sat down for a chat in Manchester.</p>
      <p>Ms Shuweikh told the <a href="https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/jewish-dad-reunites-with-muslim-woman-who-confronted-his-childrens-abuser/">Jewish News</a>: ‘He came and gave me beautiful flowers and we sat down and had a coffee and we were talking about our experiences and our backgrounds.</p>
      <p>‘It was very nice. It was lovely. We’re going to keep in touch.’</p>

      <p>Ms Shuweikh was hailed a hero online after bravely confronting the man as he read out anti-Jewish Bible verses to the man and his two sons.</p>

      <p>The man can be seen threatening another passenger who tried to step in before Ms Shuweikh got involved.</p>
      <p>She said afterwards that she ‘wouldn’t hesitate to do it again’.</p>
      <p>‘As a mother-of-two it’s appalling,’ she told BBC Radio 5 Live.</p>
      <p>‘I can’t sit back and watch that happen, to be honest.’</p>
      <p>She said she felt the incident was ‘getting out of hand’ and previously described how she tried ‘to bring him down to a level where you can have a conversation so he doesn’t go back to the Jewish family’.</p>

      <p>The victim said in a statement afterwards: ‘This Tube journey has left me with mixed feelings about society.</p>
      <p>‘On the one hand my wife, my children and I were subject to vile abuse in a full Tube carriage, however I am grateful for those who stood up for me.’</p>
      <p>A man, who has not been named by police, was arrested in Birmingham on Saturday night on suspicion of committing a racially aggravated public order offence.</p>
