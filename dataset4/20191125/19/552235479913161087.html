      <h1>Steven Pressley reveals his last-gasp Hearts manager KO and the Craig Levein phonecall that sealed his fate</h1>
      <h2>The former Gorgie skipper believes he was in line to take the job before a late development.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:16:25+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:16</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>Steven Pressley has revealed he suffered a last-gasp Hearts manager KO when <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-levein">Craig Levein</a> took the job in 2017.</p>
      <p>The former Jambos captain claims he was chief <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ann-budge">Ann Budge</a> 's preferred candidate in their hunt to replace Ian Cathro two years ago.</p>
      <p>Pressley, who refused to criticise Levein for taking on a dual role as director of football, recalled how the now-sacked boss phoned to explain the decision.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> are now searching for the 55-year-old's successor following his sacking in October, with German coach Daniel Stendel among the frontrunners.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-pressley">Pressley</a> believes he remains a good fit for a return to Tynecastle but also ruled himself out of the running.</p>

      <p>Asked if he was a candidate, Pressley told <i><b>BBC Sportsound</b> </i>: "Not at all, not at all. Just to make this absolutely clear, I'm not on this show to plug myself out.</p>
      <p>"What happened was I met the board along with Craig and I felt the interview went exceptionally well.</p>
      <p>"I felt there was a really good connection, that my style of management, what I stand for and my beliefs in management were very much suited by the club.</p>
      <p>"I was very hopeful of getting the job at that time and the feedback was I was probably Ann's preferred option at that moment in time.</p>
      <p>"But it wasn't to happen and Craig took the job. Unfortunately for myself, I didn't get that opportunity.</p>
      <p>"But the one thing I must stress is Craig did phone me up on the back of taking on the job and had the courage to explain the decision."</p>
      <p>Earlier in November, Pressley was sacked as Carlisle United boss following 10 months in charge.</p>
      <p>He left the League Two club in 19th place - although was binned despite winning two of his last three matches.</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old believes there were mitigating circumstances behind his failure and was decisive when asked if he would be up to the task in Gorgie.</p>
      <p>He said: "I do, very much so. I'm a hugely driven individual and I have huge belief in what I do.</p>
      <p>"I think failing as a football manager is part of the journey now, you have to accept and learn from that.</p>

      <p>"There's always circumstances to why you fail, they're not always what people believe.</p>
      <p>"The truth of the matter is I lost my job, like most managers lose their job, because results were perceived as not good enough and we accept that in the industry we're in.</p>
      <p>"There's also reasons to why. When I took over at Carlisle we had to recruit 15 of our 19 players in the summer.</p>
      <p>"We had a bottom four or five budget, the players we recruited were players of potential, the geography of the club makes it very difficult.</p>
      <p>"But I loved the job there because I had an amazing relationship with the players.</p>
      <p>"I'm disappointed because I never seen it coming. I had no inclination at all.</p>
      <p>"Two weeks prior to my departure I was told the investors were behind me and there was a pick-up in results.</p>
      <p>"But I accept if results are not perceived right then us as managers have to suffer the consequences."</p>
