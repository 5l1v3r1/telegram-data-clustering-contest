      <h1>J.J. Abrams Reveals How The Rise of Skywalker Script Came Up on Ebay</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:47:17+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:47</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>Lucasfilm has done a pretty solid job keeping a lid on spoilers for its latest <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars"><b>Star Wars</b></a> film, <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker"><b>The Rise of Skywalker</b></a>. But a recent incident almost put its script in the hands on a random fan on eBay. During his recent stop on <b>Good Morning America</b>, director J.J. Abrams revealed how the script accidentally got into the wild.</p>
      <p>“One of our actors, I won’t say which one — I want to, but I won’t — left it under their bed and it was found by someone who was cleaning their place,” he explained. “It was given to someone else, who then went to sell it on eBay.”</p>
      <p>This led to a few gasps from the audience. However, Abrams noted that Disney discovered the script almost immediately.</p>
      <p>“Someone at the company said, ‘You know, there’s a script that looks like it’s a legit script for sale on eBay,’” he explained. </p>

      <p>The host then joked that Disney “bought it” to avoid leaks. But according to Abrams, it didn’t go that far.</p>
      <p>“They got it back before it sold,” explained Abrams. “With all the security, you gotta be careful…”</p>
      <p>The interview is below, along with a look at the brief chase clip that <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tv/472371-rey-flees-flying-stormtroopers-in-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-clip">we reported on earlier today</a>. This involves Rey and the group outrunning Stormtroopers, who apparently “fly now.”</p>
