      <h1>City Council set to ban sale of flavored e-cigarette products after committee backs bill</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:25:30+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:25</time> by <a rel="author">Olivia Bensimon and Nolan Hicks</a></address>
      <p>A key City Council committee on Monday unanimously backed legislation that would ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes products, presaging the bill’s passage by the full Council this week.</p>
      <p>The legislation “will finally and belatedly address a health crisis that this country has been ignoring over more than four years,” City Council Member Mark Levine said.</p>
      <p>The Health Committee’s vote came just a day before the entire Council is expected to back the ban, amid growing fears about the safety of vaping products — as the usage of the thumb-drive like devices soars.</p>
      <p>So far, at least 42 people have died — <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/second-new-yorker-dead-from-vaping-related-illness-officials/">including two New Yorkers</a> — and more than 2,000 people have been sickened from vaping related illnesses across the country.</p>
      <p>Health experts have blasted vaping companies for producing nicotine-laden candy and fruit flavored products — like mango, mint, cotton candy, berry — that they say are helping to hook teenagers.The City Council’s proposed ban would nix every flavor except the traditional tobacco flavor and menthol.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want to leave a loophole like that for e-cigarettes,” Levine added. “We want this to be only an alternative to adult smokers who are trying to quit, not an enticement for kids.”</p>
      <p>Council consideration of similar legislation that would ban menthol-flavored tobacco products has stalled amid opposition from some key African American political figures, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/critics-al-sharpton-corey-johnson-holding-up-menthol-cig-ban/">including the Rev. Al Sharpton</a>.</p>
