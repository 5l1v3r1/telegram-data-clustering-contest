      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sean+Carey">Sean Carey</a>, 25 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Sea-of-Thieves/achievements">Sea of Thieves</a> players with Twitch Prime can get some new cosmetics, emotes and a monkey for free, by linking their Twitch Prime account to their Sea of Thieves account.</p>

      <p>Players can claim the Celestial Steed Ship Livery Set (comprised of a hull, sails, a Unicorn figurehead and a flag), the Competitive Emote Pack (featuring Feeling Sad, Pay Respects and Let's Go! emotes) and the Amethyst Soul Capuchin pet, for free, that is if you have Twitch Prime, which is included as part of an Amazon Prime subscription.</p>
      <p>To claim the Twitch Prime Pirate Pack, you'll need to head over to the <a href="https://twitch.amazon.com/prime/loot/seaofthieves">Twitch Prime Sea of Thieves page</a> where you can claim the offer and link your Twitch Prime account to your Sea of Thieves account. Once you log in to Sea of Thieves, head to your Pet Chest aboard your ship to find your new monkey, and the Ship Customisation Chest (next to the Shipwright) to equip the new livery set. Emotes are equipped through the Vanity Chest.</p>
      <p>It does state in the terms and conditions that you can sign up for a free 30-day trial for Prime and claim the Sea of Thieves loot. Even after the trial expires, everything will still be yours to keep — just remember to cancel that monthly subscription, or you'll be charged.</p>
      <p>In other Sea of Thieves news, the game has just had a <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39777/sea-of-thieves-the-seabound-soul-achievements">big content update called The Seabound Soul</a>. The update added eight new achievements worth 75 Gamerscore and sees players joining Captain Pendragon on a Tall Tale quest to uncover the mystery of the feared ship, The Ashen Dragon and reveal the secrets of a new threat. Ashen Chests have been added to the game too which players will have to battle skeletons on land to find or follow the fiery ship cloud in the sky to battle it out on the seas.</p>
      <p>Head over to the <a href="https://twitch.amazon.com/prime/loot/seaofthieves">Twitch Prime Sea of Thieves page</a> to claim your Twitch Prime Pirate Pack.</p>
