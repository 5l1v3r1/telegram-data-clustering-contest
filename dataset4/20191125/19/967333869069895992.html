      <p>US Energy Secretary Rick Perry has apparently managed to trigger quite a ruckus online after a short video featuring his interview at Fox &amp; Friends hit social media.</p>
      <p>In the video, Perry recalled how he gave US President Donald Trump “a little one-pager” on the Old Testament Kings, the former described as examples of “imperfect people” God used throughout history.</p>

      <blockquote>​“I said, 'Mr. President, I know there are people that say you said you were the chosen one and I said, 'You were’,” Perry said. “I said, 'If you're a believing Christian, you understand God's plan for the people who rule and judge over us on this planet in our government’. ”</blockquote>
      <p>Fox News chief national correspondent Ed Henry also noted while discussing Perry’s remarks that the Energy Secretary also “pointed out to me he believes Barack Obama was sent by God as well, for that moment and that time”, and that Perry “thinks at this moment and this time, Donald Trump was sent by God to do great things”.</p>
      <p>Many social media users, however, offered a different assessment of Trump.</p>

      <p>Some also had a few unflattering things to say about Perry himself.</p>

      <p>In August, Trump described himself as “the chosen one” while arguing that the US-Chinese trade war simply had to be waged.</p>
      <p>A few days after dropping that remark, Trump claimed that it was all just “sarcasm” and that <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201908241076626027-china-us-trump-trade-war/">he was joking</a>.</p>
