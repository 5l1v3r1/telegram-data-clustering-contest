      <p>The search for a missing pilot will continue on Tuesday after reports an aircraft crashed off the North Wales coast.</p>
      <p>Police have confirmed the small plane had just one person on board when it disappeared from radar in the area of Puffin Island near Anglesey at around 12.47pm on Monday.</p>
      <p>The plane set off from Caernarfon Airport some 25 minutes earlier to fly to the Great Orme in Llandudno and was on its way back when it lost contact.</p>
      <p>According to data from flightradar24.com, a Cessna light aircraft making the same route at the time given by police and the Coastguard descended near the uninhabited Puffin Island before it disappeared.</p>

      <p>Chief Inspector Essi Ahari said: “North Wales Police are supporting HM Coastguard in a search for a light aircraft that was flying from Caernarfon Airport to the Great Orme in Llandudno and back this afternoon.</p>
      <p>“The aircraft had one pilot on board and no other passengers, and family liaison officers are supporting the missing pilot’s family.”</p>
      <p>The force said in an earlier statement it had received a phone call at 12.59pm reporting a “possible crash” involving a light aircraft.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for HM Coastguard said it was co-ordinating a search and rescue in the Puffin Island area of North Wales following a report at 12.47pm on Monday that an aircraft had disappeared from radar contact.</p>
      <p>The search and rescue helicopter from Caernarfon had been sent as well as Coastguard rescue teams from Penmon and Bangor and a senior Coastguard operations officer, he said.</p>
      <p>The RNLI lifeboats from Beaumaris, Moelfre and Llandudno and North Wales Police were also sent.</p>
      <p>The Air Accidents Investigation Branch said in a statement: “The AAIB has sent a team to investigate an accident involving a light aircraft that occurred near Beaumaris, Gwynedd, Wales.”</p>
