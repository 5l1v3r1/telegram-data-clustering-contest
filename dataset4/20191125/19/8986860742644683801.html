      <p>Efia Odo is popularly known for sharing explicit and nude pictures of herself on social media and has always been criticized for that.</p>
      <p>It’s obvious the actress is not perturbed about the criticisms and always makes it a point to ‘fire’ anyone who makes silly comments about her mode of dressing.</p>
