      <p>It would take you a long time to find a backdrop to equal the Beara Peninsula for your wedding shots.</p>
      <p>And it’s a place that bride and groom Miriam O’Neill and Kevin Dunne are lucky enough to call home.</p>
      <p>Miriam, from Gour, Castletownbere, and Kevin, from Ahabrock, Eyeries, Beara, were married in St Kentigern’s Church, Eyeries, by Fr Danny Broderick and photographer Ian Cronin whisked them off to numerous scenic spots in the area before the party headed off for the reception in the Kenmare Bay Hotel, Co Kerry.</p>

      <p>“Our photographer Ian was fantastic. He had everyone laughing and so relaxed for the occasion, and our videographer was Brian McSweeney who was a gentleman; we didn’t even feel like we were on camera for the day,” said the bride.</p>
      <p>The newlyweds, who live in Ahabrock, Eyeries, with their sons Paul and Jamie, first met on a night out in Bantry in January 2015 and got engaged in Abufeira, Portugal, in October the following year.</p>
      <p>Helping them plan their wedding were the bride’s parents Mary and Michael Joe O’Neill and the groom’s mother and father Mary and Patrick Dunne.</p>
      <p>Miriam looked glamorous in a wedding dress sourced in Vows bridal boutique, Blarney, while the groom and his party were dapper in suits from Tom Murphy Formal &amp; Menswear, Cork.</p>
      <p>Peter Tora, owner of Scent of Tora, Castletownbere, ensured the floral arrangements were picture-perfect.</p>
      <p>Miriam’s sister Kathleen Holland’s salon K-Kutz Hair Studio took care of the bridal hairstyling which was done in Miriam’s home that morning and her childhood friend Elaine English was the makeup artist.</p>

      <p>Kathleen also took on bridesmaid duties that day along with Miriam’s niece Muireann Lynch and friend Róise Turner, while the bride’s sister Deirdre Lynch was maid of honour.</p>
      <p>Kevin’s brother PJ Dunne was best man while the couple’s son Paul O’Neill was groomsman along with the groom’s friends Kenneth Harrington, Greg Harrington, and Mike Sheehan.</p>
      <p>“My flower girls were Kayla Holland and Emma O’Brien, both our nieces and our godchildren, and our son Jamie Dunne was pageboy,” said Miriam.</p>
      <blockquote>We had the most amazing day with all our family and friends and enjoyed every moment.</blockquote>
      <p>One highlight still makes them smile.</p>
      <p>“The funniest moment of the day was when our son Jamie, aged 22 months, stole the show as he entertained everyone by dancing to our wedding band The Buachaills,” said Miriam.</p>
      <p>“The Buachaills were just fantastic and had the floor full all night.”</p>
      <p>The newlyweds have just returned from their honeymoon, a Mediterranean cruise.</p>
