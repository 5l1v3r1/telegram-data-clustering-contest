      <h1>Metro to launch an app to provide entertainment</h1>
      <h2>Commuters can enjoy movies, songs</h2>

      <p>Metro riders will now be able to enjoy their favourite movies and songs on their smartphones by downloading an app, to be launched in the first week of December, said a senior Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) official.</p>
      <p>With commuters yet to take to the network in a big way, CMRL has come up with the app to provide them entertainment on their smartphones.</p>
      <p>The hardware for the entertainment system is being installed at depots and will soon also be fitted on trains, for commuters to browse and play content.</p>
      <p>The app, to be made available on both Android and IOS platforms, is on a trial run on the Airport to Washermanpet stretch.</p>
      <p>The app, similar to an inflight entertainment system, will be the first-of-its-kind in the country on a Metro network.</p>
      <p>The app will make movies and songs available for commuters in six languages — Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Hindi and English. The commuters, after downloading the app, will be able to watch movies and songs by linking their devices to the free Wi-Fi facility available in Metro trains and stations.</p>
      <h3>Internet revenue</h3>
      <p>The official said: “Every time a commuter opens the app using the Wi-Fi and browses content, CMRL will be able to earn revenue.”</p>
      <p>The Wi-Fi will not support other internet-based apps.</p>
