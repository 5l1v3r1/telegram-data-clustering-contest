      <h1>Esper Expands on Why He Fired Navy Secretary Spencer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:15:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://townhall.com/author/cortneyobrien" target="_blank">Cortney O'Brien</a></address>
      <p>Defense Secretary Mark Esper fired Navy Secretary Richard Spencer over the weekend after reports that he proposed a secret deal with the White House over Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher. Gallagher lost his rank after his war crimes case, before President Trump issued him a pardon. Navy officials were reportedly planning an additional review, and Spencer presented a proposal to Trump noting that if he allowed the review to proceed, Gallagher could keep his Trident pin.</p>
      <p>Above all, Esper explained at a Pentagon briefing on Monday, Spencer was dismissed because he did not respect the chain of command when he went behind his back to present a plan to the White House. The secret proposal left him "<a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/11/25/secdef-i-was-flabbergasted-learn-about-spencers-secret-deal-trump.html">flabbergasted</a>."</p>
      <p>"First, we have a chain of command that should be followed and that chain of command must be kept informed," Esper said. "Second, once we agree on a position, we stick to it and support it both in private and public. Third, if you don't like that position, then simply resign."</p>

      <p>"Contrary to the narrative that someone put forward in the media, this dismissal is not about Eddie Gallagher," he emphasized. "It's about Secretary Spencer in the chain of command."</p>
      <p>Gallagher had been charged with murder for killing an ISIS fighter in 2017 but was convicted on a lesser charge of posing for a photograph with a dead captive. In his <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/25/richard-spencers-last-letter-navy-chief-after-seal-gallagher-case/4295123002/">departure letter</a>, Spencer questioned Trump's reversal of the case, suggesting he had dropped the ball on "good order and discipline."</p>
      <p>Gallagher appeared on "Fox &amp; Friends" on Sunday to blast Navy officials for "meddling" in his case.</p>
      <p>"This is all about ego and retaliation, this has nothing to do with good order or discipline," Gallagher <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dkz9MdRTZo&amp;feature=emb_title">charged</a>.</p>
      <p>The SEAL said he was "overjoyed" that President Trump had intervened to restore his rank and reputation.</p>
