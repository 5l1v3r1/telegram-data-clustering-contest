      <ul>
        <li>There are two ways to resize pictures on your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/iphone">iPhone</a>: using the default Photos app, or a third-party app like Image Size.</li>
        <li>Using either method, you can resize images on your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/iphone">iPhone</a> to whatever dimensions you’d like.</li>
        <li>However, you can’t edit the resolution using the built-in Photos app – you’ll have to use an app like Image Size for that.</li>

      <p>It’s possible to resize an image in the Photos app, with a variety of common dimensions available through the “Edit” menu.</p>
      <p><b>1.</b> Open your Photos app, and open the picture that you want to resize.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> In the upper-right corner of the screen, tap “Edit.”</p>
      <p><b>3.</b> A new menu will open, with a variety of editing tools. You’ll want to tap the Crop icon at the bottom of the screen – it looks like two right angles intersecting.</p>

        <figcaption>The icon has a number of squares and rectangles inside it.<cite>William Antonelli/Business Insider</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>You’re now in the dimension editing menu. At the bottom of the screen, you’ll find a number of options.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>“Original”</b> will revert your image to its original dimensions.</li>
        <li><b>“Freeform”</b> will let you crop the image however you’d like, by dragging your fingers from the sides of the image inward.</li>
        <li><b>“Square”</b> will cut off the sides of your image so it can fit into a square.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After that, there are a number of preset length-and-height ratios. When you tap one, the dimensions will change immediately.</p>

      <p>You can tap “Done” to save your changes, “Cancel” to discard them, or “RESET” (at the top of the screen) to start over.</p>
      <p>While all of these <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=bitht_111119_how-to-resize-an-image-on-iphone&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-iphone-11-64gb-black-verizon%2F6341340.p%3FskuId%3D6341340">iPhone</a> image editing tools are decent, what none of them can do is control image resolution.</p>
      <p>To ensure a given picture is of high enough resolution, you’ll need a third-party photo editing app.</p>

      <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/image-size/id670766542">Image Size</a> is one of the best <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=bitht_111119_how-to-resize-an-image-on-iphone&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-iphone-11-64gb-black-verizon%2F6341340.p%3FskuId%3D6341340">iPhone</a> photo-resizing apps, and as long as you’re willing to view the occasional ad, it’s totally free.</p>
      <p>Once you launch the Image Size app and grant it access to your photos, using it is easy.</p>
      <p>Tap the icon of a photo at the top left of the app screen (it looks like a mountain inside a box) and select the photo you want to resize from your Photos library.</p>
      <p>Now select the measurement format you wish to work with (from pixels to millimeters to inches) and enter the size you want the image to be, noting the maximum allowed.</p>

      <p>As you enter the new size values, you’ll see the new size of the image displayed at the bottom of the screen.</p>
      <p>Once you are happy with your picture’s shape and file size (and you have made any other edits within the app), tap the arrow facing down to a line at the bottom of the app to save the resized image back to your Camera Roll.</p>
