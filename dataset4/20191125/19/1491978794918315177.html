        <i>Vox refusal to sign joint all-party statement outrages civil rights groups and embarrasses allies</i>
      </p>
      <p>Spain’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/10/vox-party-puts-menace-of-migrant-children-at-centre-of-election-drive">far-right Vox party</a> has refused to sign an all-party declaration condemning violence against women, drawing outrage from civil rights groups and embarrassing its allies in the conservative People’s party.</p>
      <p>Vox’s refusal to sign the declaration by Madrid city council on Monday meant that for the first time since a landmark 2004 law on gender violence, local authorities in the Spanish capital were unable to issue a joint all-party statement.</p>
      <p>In this month’s national election <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/10/spain-general-election-polls-pedro-sanchez-psoe">Vox bec</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/10/spain-general-election-polls-pedro-sanchez-psoe">ame the third-largest party in the Spanish parliament</a>, after more than doubling its number of seats with its mix of nationalist, anti-Muslim and anti-feminist rhetoric.</p>
      <p>Javier Ortega Smith, a member of both Madrid city council and the national parliament, said the declaration on the UN’s International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women">Women</a> addressed only one side of gender violence.</p>
      <p>In a speech greeted by shouts of anger from the audience in Madrid’s city hall, he condemned what he described as “denialists” on gender violence, adding: “There are also men who suffer violence from women and are killed by their wives.”</p>
      <p>Hours later thousands of people took to the streets across <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/spain">Spain</a> to demand that authorities do more to address the issue.</p>
      <p>In Madrid, demonstrators brought traffic in the city centre to a standstill, waving signs saying “How many more women must die?” and chanting: “It’s not an isolated case; it’s patriarchy.”</p>
      <p>The remarks were also condemned by the mayor of Madrid, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, from the centre-right PP, whose conservative administration with the pro-business Ciudadanos relies on four Vox votes for a majority in the city council. “It is not politics what you have done here today; it is political posturing,” said Almeida.</p>
      <p>The PP’s national leader, Pablo Casado, also tried to distance his party from its far-right allies, urging other parties to “join forces to fight against abusers”.</p>
      <p>There was an even angrier reaction from civil rights activists, notably Nadia Otmani, head of an association that helps migrant women deal with gender violence.</p>
      <p>Otmani, who has used a wheelchair for 20 years after her brother-in-law shot her as she tried to defend her sister, approached Ortega Smith after his speech, saying: “You cannot do this! You cannot play politics with gender violence!”</p>
      <p>“Vox came mounting an important challenge to democracy and started with this one,” said the acting deputy prime minister, Carmen Calvo, from the centre-left Socialists.</p>
      <p>According to official statistics compiled since 2003, 1,024 women have been killed in Spain by their partners as of 22 October. To date this year, 52 women have been killed.</p>
      <p>The latest victim, a woman in Tenerife, was allegedly murdered by her partner on Monday.</p>
