      <p>The Founder and General Overseer of Charismatic Anointing Ministries, Prophet Bernard Owusu Ansah has made a bizarre revelation (from the perspective of Christians) about the kind of songs he listens to.</p>
      <p>He told blogger Zion Felix on his Uncut show that there is nothing wrong in listening to secular songs that will boost his appetite for sekz.</p>
      <p>The Man of God said there are certain songs that enhance the relationship couples share in the bedroom and as a Pastor he relies heavily on such songs to make love to his woman.</p>

      <p>He asserted that songs like Kelvyn Boy ‘Coffee’ is very good for ‘bedmatics’ and that’s why he won’t stop listening to it.</p>
      <p>He stressed how good love songs are, and added that Jesus was a fan of love songs.</p>
      <p>Though he claims to be selective when listening to secular songs, Pastor Bernard said Coffee will continue to be his favourite.</p>
