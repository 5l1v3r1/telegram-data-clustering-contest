      <p>A couple who won a £105 million EuroMillions jackpot are set to reveal how they plan to spend the cash.</p>
      <p>The joint winners, from the Chichester area of West Sussex, have not yet been named but will reveal their identities at a press conference on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>A single ticket won £105,100,701.90 on November 19, the 25th anniversary of the National Lottery’s first draw.</p>
      <p>National Lottery operator Camelot said the “hard-working” couple, who are joint winners, will reveal how they plan to use the win to transform the lives of their whole family.</p>
