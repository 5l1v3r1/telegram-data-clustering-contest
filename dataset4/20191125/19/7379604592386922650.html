There were tears, there were tantrums and there were tasty trials. It all started with Jacqueline Jossa in tears as she prepared to meet her doom in the Bush Tucker Trial, but the night delivered much more than that. SCREAM! Wrighty and Jossa smashed The Crevice of Cruelty trial, bagging all 12 stars and an eel for the camp. BOSS! James Haskell took his role as camp leader very seriously, but got Andrew’s back up, who also clashed with Ian. Who’s getting hangry out there? SPLAT! Double act Roman and Kate won jellybeans in the jungle quiz, but got covered in rainbow gunk in the process. MESSAGE! Love Island came to I’m A Celeb, giving the celebrities the chance to put their faces in putrid pies in exchange for a roast dinner. PORK! James and Roman were responsible for one of the biggest giggles of the night when they passed a pig’s testicle using only their mouths. HUNGRY! Ian, Cliff and Andy were left without roasts after the Love Island challenge, despite Wrighty downing his disgusting drink in record time. I'm A Celeb is back tomorrow night at 9pm, when we'll see what Nadine and her breakaway camp have been up to. (Clue: it probably involves a dance routine.)</li>

No-one is safe from the camp leader once he gets going – and that includes Dec. When the host quipped he'd been “unlucky” in the Love Island challenge, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10415173/im-a-celeb-james-haskell-dec-crab/">James got a little prickly</a>.</li>
