      <p>MESA, AZ — An arrest was made in a fatal car crash on U.S. 60 in Mesa.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/region-southeast-valley/mesa/dps-us-60-eastbound-closed-at-country-club-after-fatal-crash">Around 2 a.m. on Sunday</a> , DPS troopers received a call regarding a car facing sideways on US-60 eastbound at Country Club due to a possible collision, according to DPS.</p>
      <p>When troopers arrived on scene, they determined at least one person sustained serious injuries. That person, Dennisha Lawanda Owens, 22, later died from her injuries.</p>
      <p>Deanndra Oymay Woo, 24, was the driver of the other vehicle.</p>
      <p>Woo allegedly told DPS that she drank cranberry and vodka cocktail, followed by a beer about 9 p.m. Saturday.</p>
      <p>Troopers say Woo’s B.A.C. level was recorded by a portable breathalyzer to be .115.</p>
      <p>Woo is currently being held on a $150, 000 bond for DUI and second-degree murder.</p>
