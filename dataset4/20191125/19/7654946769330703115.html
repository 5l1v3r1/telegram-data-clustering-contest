      <h1>NYC’s Asian students surpass other racial groups in college enrollment rates</h1>

      <p>A record-high 80.5 percent of Asian city high-school students advanced to college last year — easily surpassing other racial groups, The Post has learned.</p>
      <p>The Asian students were followed by white students at 73.4 percent, black students at 55.9 percent and Hispanic students at 54.1 percent, according to new Department of Education data.</p>
      <p>Overall, college enrollment hit a high of 61.8 percent last year, officials said last week.</p>
      <p>While racial-achievement gaps have narrowed slightly since 2013, the divides remain stark.</p>
      <p>That year, 72.4 percent of Asians advanced to college, followed by whites at 67.9 percent, blacks at 43.5 percent and Hispanics at 42.4 percent. A total of 50.9 percent of students went on to college in 2013.</p>
      <p>Black and Hispanic college enrollment has risen by 12.4 percentage points and 11.7 percentage points respectively since that year.</p>
      <p>Asians have seen a 8.1 percentage point increase, and whites had the slowest percentage point hike, at 5.5, according to the DOE.</p>
      <p>“We are fighting to ensure every child from every neighborhood gets a quality education,” said spokeswoman Danielle Filson. “The achievement gap remains one of the biggest challenges nationally, but in New York, the gap is narrowing for college enrollment.”</p>
      <p>While City Hall has crowed about ascending college enrollment, critics have questioned the the DOE’s ability to ready students for advanced academic work and ultimate success.</p>
      <p>The DOE acknowledged to The Post on Friday that it does not track college graduation rates for city kids and only maintains a “persistence” metric. That measure tracks if city kids are still enrolled in college by their third semester but does not monitor progress beyond that point.</p>
      <p>A lack of hard graduation data for city students is of particular concern because of consistently low “college readiness” rates at city schools. The metric assesses the ability to handle basic CUNY freshman coursework.</p>
      <p>Even with increasingly diluted standards at CUNY, that figure stood at just 51 percent overall last year.</p>
      <p>Students who arrive on campus unable to meet those expectations must pay for remedial classes that don’t provide college credit.</p>
      <p>Of the 48,782 city kids who enrolled in college last year, 27,783 went on to CUNY schools, 8,241 went to SUNY campuses, and 4,637 attended college out of state.</p>
      <p>Another 6,858 went to private colleges in the state, and 1,263 enrolled in vocational and public service programs, according to the DOE.</p>
