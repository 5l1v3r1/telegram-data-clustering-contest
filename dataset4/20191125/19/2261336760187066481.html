      <p>Late last week, Floyd Mayweather Jr. announced he’s coming out of retirement for the fourth time. According to the 42-year-old undefeated boxer, he’s also <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/22/20977325/floyd-mayweather-says-hes-coming-out-of-retirement-working-with-dana-white-on-spectacular-event">working on a “spectacular event”</a> with UFC president Dana White which they’re scheduling for 2020.</p>
      <p>Another <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/24/20980037/report-floyd-mayweather-targeting-bouts-with-a-ufc-fighter-and-manny-pacquiao-in-2020">TMZ report</a> stated that Mayweather is targeting big money fights against a UFC star and rival Manny Pacquiao. His father, Floyd Sr., however, was surprised that such talks are happening, and he isn’t enjoying the idea.</p>
      <p>“We usually talk but I ain’t heard nothing from him,” the elder Mayweather told Marcos Villegas of FightHub TV (transcript by <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/24/20981074/mayweather-sr-will-whup-dana-whites-ass-if-floyd-jr-takes-a-ufc-fight">MMA Mania</a>). “It’s a big surprise to me.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want ... it ain’t the same,” he said. “It’s not the same, I’m just saying.”</p>
      <p>Floyd Jr.’s announcement led betting oddsmakers to hold wagers on <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/23/20979278/betting-odds-pacquiao-favored-as-mayweathers-next-opponent-dana-white-gsp-options-boxing-mma-news">several possibilities for his return</a>, including MMA crossovers with the UFC and ONE Championship.</p>
      <p>If such a transition is part of the plan, Floyd Sr. is having none of it.</p>
      <p>“You got things that Floyd can do, a lot of other things other than ... and they said he was saying something about getting into that ... what that thing called?</p>
      <p>“It better not be the MMA,” he added.</p>
      <p>“You don’t think Floyd would take nothing like that? I don’t think he’d take it either because I’d go in there and whoop Dana White’s ass! F—k yeah I will. I’d whoop the sh-t out of him.</p>
      <p>“Even though Floyd is a grown man, I’d be the grown one that’d take over that. Sure will.”</p>
      <p>Mayweather Jr.’s last comeback took place in 2017, where he defeated Conor McGregor via tenth-round TKO. He also fought Rizin’s Tenshin Nasukawa in an exhibition boxing match in New Year’s eve of 2018, where he won via first-round TKO.</p>
