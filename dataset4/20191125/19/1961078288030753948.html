      <p>Re “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/us/politics/navy-secretary-richard-spencer-resign.html?module=inline">Naval Secretary Is Told to Resign by Defense Chief</a>” (front page, Nov. 25):</p>
      <p>Imagine that an authoritarian president in a country in Eastern Europe, Africa or South America pardons military operatives accused of murderous war crimes. What would be your reaction?</p>
      <p>President Trump’s norm-breaking interference in the military chain of command hits a new level of dangerousness. For if military discipline can be overthrown at the whim of the commander in chief, it is no longer subject to the rule of law.</p>
      <p>We’re on the cusp of a situation in which the president could directly order a war crime, foreign or domestic, and then pardon the perpetrators. This would be true tyranny.</p>

      <p>I’m a Marine who was on active duty from 1966 to 1968. To me the worst thing President Trump has done, worse than his constant lying, lawbreaking and advocacy of cruelty and exclusion, is intervening on behalf of a Navy SEAL convicted of exulting over a dead prisoner whom he may have killed. Our military, like most in the West, has committed war crimes, but hitherto it has tried to own up to it, to try servicemen and women accused of war crimes and punish those convicted, as it did those who <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/02/25/the-water-cure">waterboarded Filipinos</a> during the Philippine-American War early in the 20th century and those who massacred civilians in Vietnam.</p>
      <p>Now the man in overall command of the forces helps a convicted war criminal, saves his rank and has the secretary of the Navy fired for defending our Uniform Code of Military Justice. To me that’s inexcusable.</p>

      <p>Re “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/opinion/editorials/trump-gallagher-pardon-war-crimes.html?module=inline">The Moral Injury of Pardoning War Crimes</a>” (editorial, Nov. 24):</p>
      <p>The obvious way to avoid war-induced moral injury is not to engage in immoral wars in the first place, nor to glorify militarism run amok. But go to war we do, and President Trump is not the first to excuse inexcusable killing. The moral injury that results, however, is not so much a bruise on the soul, as a scar on the soul, which doesn’t go away. Nor should it.</p>
      <p>Painful as it is, soldiers need to come to terms with their actions, as do the nations that send them to war, and more than treatment, what’s required is atonement.</p>
      <p>In researching soldiers who came to oppose war, I’ve talked with scores of veterans of wars from Vietnam to the present, most of whom have some form of a moral injury. They atone by working to end wars.</p>
      <p>Though I have no idea about the state of the souls of the veterans in Congress, if they too feel a moral injury, cutting the bloated military budget and putting a stop to our endless rounds of war would be good places to start atoning.</p>
