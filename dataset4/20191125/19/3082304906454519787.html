      </p>
      <p>World number two Karolina Pliskova has appointed Dani Vallverdu as her new coach for the 2020 season.</p>
      <p>The Czech recently split with Conchita Martinez just six months after appointing the Spaniard on a full-time basis, having also worked with Rennae Stubbs.</p>
      <p>Pliskova has now turned to Vallverdu, who has coached the likes of Andy Murray, Juan Martin del Potro and Stan Wawrinka, as she eyes an elusive first grand slam title.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old hopes the Venezuelan can take her game to another level next year in what will be his first experience of coaching on the WTA Tour.</p>
      <p>“He was one of my priorities from the beginning. He’s had great results with his players, he understands tennis like hardly anyone else and I’m convinced he has a lot to offer to me,” she said of the Venezuelan.</p>
      <p>“I’m already looking forward to the start of the preparation.”</p>
      <p>Former doubles player Olga Savchuk has also joined Pliskova’s coaching staff.</p>
