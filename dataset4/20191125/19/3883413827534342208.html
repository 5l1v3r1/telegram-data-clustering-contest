      <p>The Royal Navy's time as guardians started on Monday morning as 35 sailors took over from 1st Battalion The Grenadier Guards at Buckingham Palace. </p>
      <p>Officer commanding the Royal Navy Guard, Lieutenant Commander Richard Dobson, said: “This will be an intense and memorable experience for all of us at the end of several weeks of ceremonial duties training, just eight or nine days of it specifically on palace guarding.</p>
      <p>“The instructors from the guards could not have been better, for those eight or nine days they really put us through our paces and prepared us thoroughly for our 'Fit For Role' inspection last week enabling us to mount guards today.”</p>

      <p>Lieutenant Commander Dobson volunteered to lead the contingent of sailors and in turn, is believed to be the first sailor to become Captain of the Queen's Guard since Sir Walter Raleigh in 1587.</p>
      <p>He said the duties "could be regarded as the pinnacle" of his Navy career which began in the 1990s.</p>
      <p>Away from the public eye, the sailors will spend their time tending to their uniform and rehearsing drills.</p>
      <p>Royal Navy and Royal Marines musicians are also part of the duties, with one of the bands playing music whenever the sailors are mounting or dismounting the guard.</p>
