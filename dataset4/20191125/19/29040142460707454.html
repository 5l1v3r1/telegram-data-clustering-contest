      <p>Staff Pick</p>
      <p>The Galaxy Tab S6 is the latest flagship tablet from Samsung and it's quite impressive. The Tab S6 is touted to last up to 15 hours on a single charge, while including the S Pen in the box. Under the hood, you get Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855 and either 6GB or 8GB of RAM, along with either 128GB or 256GB of expandable storage.</p>

      <p>The Galaxy Tab S5e isn't an upgrade to the Tab S4, with Samsung instead going the route of 'affordable premium.' Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 670, and 4GB of RAM, the Galaxy Tab S5e has the same 10.5-inch OLED screen as its predecessor, but the most impressive part is the fact that it's lighter and thinner than the Tab S4.</p>

The S Pen also comes packed in the device, so it's truly worth the experience, especially when purchased with the keyboard cover.</p>

      <h3>Why are there so few great Android-powered tablets?</h3>

      <p>There are many reasons as to why it's nigh-impossible to find great Android-powered tablets on the market. Some may point to the continued dominance of Apple's iPad and the seamless nature of how Apple manages its iOS ecosystem. Others may point to the sensation that is the Microsoft Surface line of products, which helped to further introduce the 2-in-1 form factor for tablet computers. Google hasn't helped things for its tablet OS, going as far as to create the Google Pixel line of <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-pixelbook">notebooks</a> and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-pixel-slate">tablets</a> for its Chrome OS, which, in some ironic twist, is able to run Android apps from Google Play. Third-party support is also lacking on tablet Android. There are a significant number of applications that are still incompatible with the tablet version of the OS, which can hurt the experience.</p>
      <p>That being said, Samsung is still one of the few companies that are investing in the Android tablet scene, and have been the flag bearer for Android-powered tablets, especially with its Galaxy Tab S line of tablets, including the current <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-128GB-Tablet-Mountain/dp/B07VGJH29F?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU73867YYw">Samsung Galaxy Tab S6</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-WiFi-Tablet-Black/dp/B07Q5VPY2F/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU73867YYw">Galaxy Tab S5e</a>. There are also still some <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a> around that aren't from Samsung.</p>
      <h3>If we're making some suggestions...</h3>
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab line of tablets have something for everybody. If you're a fan of getting the new hotness, then you want to look no further than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-128GB-Tablet-Mountain/dp/B07VGJH29F?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU73867YYw">Samsung Galaxy Tab S6</a>. This tablet is equipped with all of the power one could want from a tablet, along with the ability to turn into a desktop-like experience if you spring for the optional keyboard. However, Samsung did the right thing here and included the S Pen with every Tab S6, reducing potential costs.</p>
      <p>If you're looking for a family friendly tablet without wrecking your wallet, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Kids-Tablet-Silver/dp/B07VDB92S3/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU73867YYw">Samsung Galaxy Tab A Kids Editio</a> is an amazing entry-level tablet that can do the basics.
