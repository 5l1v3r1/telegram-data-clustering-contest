      <p>The City of Kelowna will have to figure out over the next few months how to implement the contents of a resource review on policing in the city.</p>
      <p>The report, prepared by Dr. Curt Griffiths and Dr. Nahanni Pollard, concludes the city's RCMP detachment is woefully understaffed.</p>
      <p>Over the next five years, they suggest the city hire an additional 56 officers and 28 civilian support positions, at a cost of upwards of $12 million.</p>
      <p>However, deputy city manager Joe Creron said those positions will be added incrementally, similar to the way the city added officers following the 2012 Prosser report.</p>
      <p>"You'll see we are proposing to add approximately seven RCMP officers as Priority 1 in this (2020) budget, and 12 in the area of police services," he said.</p>
      <p>"The whole point for us is to come back in 2020 with a strategy that looks across the five years."</p>
      <p>Creron added with the current climate of social issues facing the city, its irrelevant how many officers are added, it won't solve the problem of homelessness, mental health or eliminate related crime without more attention from senior levels of government.</p>
      <p>"If the other levels of government don't deal adequately with the crisis, lots of money will still be spent by municipalities, residents and businesses to maintain safety, but the root of the problem will not be addressed."</p>
      <p>In his lengthy report, Dr. Griffiths said the days of municipalities writing blank cheques whenever detachments ask for more resources is over.</p>
      <p>He says police must demonstrate they are using existing resources effectively, and efficiently.</p>
      <p>"Our view right now is the detachment is doing the best it can with what it's got. Our other view is that there are a lot of pieces scattered on the table, and there's not a framework that links them together as to who does what," said Griffiths.</p>
      <p>"The proviso is the additional resources should be designed to fill the gaps that have been identified, specifically targeted. It has to be evidence based."</p>
      <p>Part of that evidence, said Griffiths is the fact 12 per cent of all Priority 1 calls are made with just a single officer.</p>
      <p>"That is a no-no in policing. You don't go to a Priority 1 by yourself. That's a direct result of understaffing. Priority 1 calls are calls where lives are in immediate danger, serious harm is about to be done or has been done. That is a huge red flag for us.</p>
      <p>"That is another piece that goes into us concluding that this detachment is understaffed. It places the officers at risk, it raises mental health issues with these officers dealing with these over and over again."</p>
      <p>Since 2012, Kelowna has authorized the addition of 40 officers and 21 in police services and bylaws, however, Griffiths stated Kelowna is the fastest growing city in the province and the fifth fastest growing metropolitan area in the country, growing at a rate of 1.8 per cent, well ahead of the national average of 1.4 per cent.</p>
      <p>While city staff will come back with a plan early next year, Creron said that won't be necessarily be written in stone.</p>
      <p>He says the city will begin seeing benefits of some of the initiatives already in place. which could alter the plan.</p>
      <p>"If these watch people can deal with a lot of Priority 4 calls, it might free up some of our existing officers to deal with the real issues of the day," said Creron.</p>
      <p>"If we have more supportive housing brought on-stream, it might be less calls from people, for example in the downtown, to deal with some of the nuisances going on and some of the crime downtown."</p>
