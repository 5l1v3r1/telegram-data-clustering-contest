      <p>West Ham United are supposedly keen on signing Paderborn striker Streli Mamba.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.calciomercato.it/news/357474/calciomercato_esclusivo_scout_atalanta_a_dortmund_per_la_punta">Calciomercato report</a> the Hammers are on contention to snap up the 25-year-old, who only signed him in the summer from Energie Cottbus.</p>

      <p>Mamba, who is German-Congolese, has hit five goals and made one assist in his first 10 appearances for the Bundesliga side, who are bottom of the table after 12 rounds of fixtures.</p>
      <p>Two of those goals came against title challengers Borussia Dortmund during a 3-3 draw on Friday, which he celebrated with his trademark serpent gesture in reference to his name.</p>
      <p>He has certainly made an effervescent start to life at the newly promoted club, and Calciomercato say West Ham are monitoring him.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – A risk worth taking for West Ham?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/streli-mamba-who-is-the-paderborn-striker-borussia-dortmund-double-8318">According to bundesliga.com</a>, Streli plays a little like RB Leipzig ace Timo Werner in that he is very pacey and is a strong instinctive finisher.</p>

      <p>He can also come in off the left like Werner as well as play centrally.</p>
      <p>Streli would be a risk for West Ham; he has little experience in the Bundesliga and a step up to the Premier League would be tough.</p>
      <p>But he has something about him, and perhaps he could shake things up for a team that are really struggling right now.</p>
