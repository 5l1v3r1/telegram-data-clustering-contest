      <p>It’s not uncommon for noses to become stuffier as the air becomes colder. If you’ve fallen victim to Flu season, you’re probably stocking up on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/allergy-medicine-remedies">some quick fixes</a> for dreaded congestion.</p>
      <p>You can’t control the environment and just rid the outdoor air of allergens, pollutants, and irritants. But there is some air you actually <i>can</i> control – the indoor air inside your home.</p>
      <p>While your home serves as a refuge from most of the risks posed by the outside world, it still hosts plenty of irritants like bacteria, viruses, pollen, pet dander, and fumes from cleaning supplies. Evidence has suggested that most <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/improve-indoor-air">indoor air is actually more polluted</a> than outdoor air, according to <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/inside-story-guide-indoor-air-quality">The Environmental Protection Agency</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>An <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-air-purifier#the-best-air-purifier-overall-1">air purifier</a> removes most of the pollutants from your indoor air, ultimately leaving you with fresher, cleaner air.</b>

Still, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01728NLRG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=biip_041919_coway-ap-sale-20&amp;amp;linkId=c1d7a4090a3891287ea02c37ca0795bb&amp;amp;language=en_US">Coway Mighty</a> is a great product and at this price, a really great deal. Here’s what you need to know about the purifier.</p>
      <p>Designed for medium-sized spaces like small apartments or living rooms, the Coway Mighty works for areas up to 361 square feet. It’s a small, portable device that uses a four-stage filtration system to reduce up to 99.97% of particle pollution. The pollution sensor – a bright LED on the device – shows you real-time cleaning status, so you can gauge your indoor air quality at any time. There’s also a filter replacement indicator, which will alert you when it’s time to change the filters.</p>
      <p>Some other helpful features are the timer, which lets you schedule how long you’d like the purifier to operate (either one, four, eight, or 12 hours), and the three different fan speeds, which you can adjust based on your preference and purification needs.</p>
      <p>After testing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01728NLRG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=biip_041919_coway-ap-sale-20&amp;amp;linkId=c1d7a4090a3891287ea02c37ca0795bb&amp;amp;language=en_US">Coway AP-1515HH</a> with new and old filters, <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-air-purifier/">Wirecutter</a> found that year-old filters, which had been used 24/7, still cleaned the air just as well as brand-new filters. Ultimately, it’s this combination of effectiveness and long-term performance that makes the air purifier a worthy investment, especially at such a great price.</p>
