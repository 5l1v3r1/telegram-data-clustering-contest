      <h1>Rise of the 'millionaire's advent calendar' undermines Christmas message, say charities</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:13:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/mason-boycott-owen/" target="_blank">Mason Boycott-Owen</a></address>
      <p>Christian groups have spoken out against ‘millionaire advent calendars’ which they argue undermine the Christmas message.</p>
      <p>Two advent calendars from well-known jewelers will set you back as much as £100,000.</p>
      <p>An advent calendar from Beaverbrooks features a platinum diamond ring worth £26,000 behind one of its doors, while Tiffany’s offering has trinkets worth up to £13,000 in its famous blue boxes.</p>
      <p>Some Christian charities suggested that the vast sums of money could be better spent on helping those in need, with some charities seeing their donations fall in recent years.</p>
      <p>Since 2016, the individual donations to Christian Aid has fallen by almost a quarter from £62.6 million to £49.7 million last year.</p>
      <p>Deborah Auty from Christian Aid said: “To put the £100,000 advent calendars in perspective, it’s worth remembering that it takes a very small amount to offer hope to communities living in dire conditions globally. </p>
      <p>“For example, the same amount of money could provide safe shelter for over 500 families living in camps in Afghanistan throughout the forthcoming harsh winter.”</p>
      <p>Many churches in the UK remain in disrepair as the Christmas season approaches after last year s<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/09/churches-feel-pane-stained-glass-stolen-order/">aw a 75% increase in Heritage Crime attacks.</a></p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the National Churches Trust said: “"A gift of £100,000 would be a dream come true for many churches needing urgent repairs as many major building projects cost at least £200,000. </p>
      <p>“Each year we receive many more applications than we are able to fund. </p>
      <p>“With £100,000 we award 20 small grants of £5,000 to help fund urgent maintenance work to ensure that churches are windproof and watertight and able to serve their local communities at Christmas and throughout the winter season."</p>
