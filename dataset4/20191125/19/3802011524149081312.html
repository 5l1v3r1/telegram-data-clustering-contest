      <p>He stands accused of siphoning US$340 000 from the national broadcaster.</p>
      <p>According to court papers, Mavhura allegedly bought a house in the leafy suburb of Borrowdale, including vehicles and other properties from the illicit proceeds.</p>
      <p>“An advertising company, Total Media, was asked to make advance payments of US$75 000 and US$25 000 to an Ecobank account belonging to Mugiya and Macharaga Law chambers in exchange for advertising airtime worth US$112 500 and $37 000 respectively,” the court papers read in part.</p>
      <p>“The former ZBC boss and his accomplice again entered into another agreement with Adrenalin Advertising agent, who had to make yet again an advance payment of US$100 000 in exchange for advertising airtime worth US$150 000.</p>
      <p>“Under instruction from Shumba, Adrenalin Advertising deposited the money into Mugiya and Mucharaga Law Chambers’ Ecobank account.”</p>
      <p>The national broadcaster has been haunted by corrupt bosses as they recently also dismissed former boss Happison Muchechetere over fraud allegations.</p>
      <p>Mavhura’s appointment also raised a stink as he was one of 15 people interviewed for the position on a substantive basis in 2017, coming seventh.</p>
      <p>A former soldier, Mavhura, was however still appointed chief executive, with the ZBC board chairman at the time, Fidelis Munyoro, publicly stating that those who scored better than him had failed a “security vetting process” by the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO).</p>
      <p>The acting CEO is Wisdom Hombarume. <b><a href="https://zimmorningpost.com/zbc-hunts-for-new-chief-executive-as-state-broadcaster-is-haunted-by-corrupt-bosses/">Zim Morning Post</a></b></p>
