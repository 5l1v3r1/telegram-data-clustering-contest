      <h1>ESB and Coillte agree renewable energy deal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:50:46+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/geoff-percival/" target="_blank">By Geoff Percival</a></address>
      <p>The ESB and State forestry company Coillte have formally reached agreement on the establishment of a renewable energy joint venture.</p>
      <p>However, completion of the deal is not expected until some time next year given that it requires final approval from the Government, the EU and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.</p>
      <p>The new operation will be run as an equally-owned joint venture and will initially focus on the construction of windfarms on Coillte-owned land around the country.</p>
      <p>Some solar energy sites may be considered, but the bulk of the venture will focus on onshore wind energy.</p>
      <p>The two parties had been in talks over a renewable energy partnership since the early part of this year and had originally aimed to finalise a deal by May.</p>
      <p>While formal agreement is six months later than planned, the broad terms of the partnership are largely unchanged from what has previously been communicated by the companies.</p>
      <p>The overall plan is to generate around 1,000MW of renewable energy by 2020 . That is enough to power around 500,000 homes.</p>
      <p>It is understood around 20 wind- farms will be built on Coillte’s nationwide landbank at a development cost of €1bn to €1.5bn.</p>
      <p>Construction is expected to begin in the early 2020s.</p>
      <p>Coillte sold the vast bulk of its windfarm assets to energy infrastructure company Greencoat Renewables for more than €280m last year.</p>
      <p>However, rather than reflecting a retreat from the sector, Coillte viewed that sale as a mechanism by which to raise funds for a more concerted tilt at the renewable energy business.</p>

      <p>Speaking earlier this year, a Coillte spokesperson said the energy output being planned by the potential joint venture with the ESB would be “a significant contribution to help Ireland’s energy transition”.</p>
      <p>Coillte has previously said it would explore a range of partnerships in relation to its future renewable energy ambitions. It has collaborated on a range of renewable energy projects with the ESB since 2003.</p>
      <p>This joint venture is the latest in a rapidly increasing portfolio of renewable plans for the ESB. Earlier this year, it said it was working to develop a pipeline of projects that would enable it to generate at least 40% of its electricity from renewable, or zero-carbon sources by 2030.</p>
      <p>It said at the time that storage, solar, onshore and offshore wind, waste energy, biomass and gas-fired plants were all included in its plans.</p>
      <p>The ESB spent around €250m on renewable energy projects last year including starting development on two onshore windfarms here.</p>
      <p>In January, it said it would co-develop two planned offshore windfarms in the Irish Sea in conjunction with Belgian firm Parkwind.</p>
      <p>Last week, the ESB announced a partnership with Norwegian energy company Equinor to develop a number of large-scale offshore wind-farms by 2030.</p>
      <p>The Government is targeting 70% of the country’s electricity generation coming from renewable energy sources, such as windfarms, by 2030.</p>
      <p>As part of that plan, it wants at least 3.5GW of offshore wind-generating power in place in the next 10 years.</p>
      <p>The Arklow Bank wind- farm, located off the Co Wicklow coast, is Ireland’s sole functioning offshore wind-farm project.</p>
