      <h1>'Going nowhere' - Wolves fans hit back after Nuno is tipped for Arsenal job</h1>
      <h2>The Wanderers boss has emerged as the bookies' favourite to become the next Gunners manager</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:58:43+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:58</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Watson</a></address>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers fans have been reacting to the news that Nuno Espirito Santo is the bookies' favourite to become the next Arsenal manager.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> chief has <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolves-boss-nuno-espirito-santo-17315389">emerged as the early front runner</a> to succeed under-pressure Unai Emery if the Spaniard is relieved of his duties.</p>
      <p>After a run of two wins in 11 Premier League matches, Arsenal are eighth in the table, a point behind fifth-placed Wanderers.</p>
      <p>And the Molineux faithful are desperate for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/nuno-makes-demand-wolves-players-17306508">Nuno</a> to remain at the club.</p>
      <p>Here is what some fans had to say about the situation on <a href="https://twitter.com/home">Twitter</a> ...</p>
      <p><b>Matt:</b> Nuno isn't going anywhere, We signed better players then Arsenal have the last 2 years, with Fosun backed Jorge Mendes help, plus João Moutinho signing a New 3 Year Deal!  Sure he wouldn't of signed unless he knew Nuno was staying.</p>
      <p><b>Neil Ford:</b> Guo Guangchang is in the top 4 of wealthiest owners in the @premierleague #nuno won't be going anywhere.</p>
      <p><b>Jack:</b> While Nuno is a top manager, there's no way he's going to Arsenal. Wolves are developing in to a top English side &amp; he'd be stupid to leave.</p>
      <p><b>Jake Longworth:</b> It was only a matter of time before a manager of Nuno’s calibre and class started attracting interest from the likes of Arsenal etc. They’d be mad not to consider luring him! I still reckon he’ll stay at Wolves though.</p>

      <p><b>Mark Ford:</b> Are Wolves not a better football team than Arsenal? plus they have more money than Arsenal.</p>
      <p><b>Kevin Astley:</b> I've just logged Twitter seen that Nuno is trending. We know he ain't going anywhere. He is doing a fantastic job at Wolves.</p>
      <p><b>Dan Southall:</b> Nuno is going nowhere.</p>
      <p><b>Brian Ambler:</b> Going nowhere - he's a #wwfc man.</p>
      <p><b>Michael:</b> I’ll be absolutely devastated if Nuno left for Arsenal.</p>

      <p><b>Jamie Walters:</b> A sign of how good Nuno and Wolves are doing, have to admit it does make me feel a bit uncomfortable, don’t think he’d leave for Arsenal currently but there are going to be even big clubs looking at Nuno now.</p>
      <p><b>@SouthBankMatt:</b> I really can’t see Moutinho signing a contract extension on Saturday, only for Nuno to leave 48 hours later.</p>
      <p><b>Darb:</b> Nuno only leaves if a giant club come calling. Arsenal aren’t that.</p>
