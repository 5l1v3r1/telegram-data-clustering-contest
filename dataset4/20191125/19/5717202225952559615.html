      <h1>Could reported interest in Liverpool star see Eddie Nketiah return to Arsenal?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:15:52+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal loanee Eddie Nketiah is still yet to start for Leeds United in the Championship this season as Marcelo Bielsa continues to place his faith in Patrick Bamford – and could reported interest in a Liverpool player see Nketiah’s loan cancelled?</p>
      <p>Nketiah, 20, joined Leeds in the summer on loan until the end of the season with many of the belief that he would break his way into the starting line-up under Bielsa. However, he has only started two Carabao Cup games.</p>
      <p>The England Under-21 international is currently nursing an abdominal problem and has been sidelined since October – though he is expected to return to action soon. There has been talk, though, that Nketiah’s loan could be cancelled.</p>
      <p>Arsenal may feel that Nketiah’s development would improve should the striker return to Arsenal and move on loan elsewhere. Now, the latest reports claims Leeds are eyeing Liverpool youngster Rhian Brewster ahead of the January transfer window.</p>

      <p>Brewster made his Liverpool debut earlier in the season against MK Dons in the Carabao Cup before playing a starring role in the penalty-shootout win over Nketiah’s parent club. He scored from the spot as Liverpool booked their place in the next round.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/liverpool-starlet-rhian-brewster-wanted-20946287">The Daily Mirror claim</a> Leeds are rivalling Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and Swansea City for Nketiah’s England Under-21 teammate. The striker could be allowed to leave Liverpool on loan in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The fact Leeds are targeting another striker puts weight behind the rumours that Nketiah could return to Arsenal. Bielsa already has six players on loan at Elland Road, meaning one misses out due to the five-loan rule in a matchday squad.</p>
      <p>If Brewster is being targeted by Leeds, it could mean that Arsenal are looking to recall Nketiah in January. Indeed, Bielsa will not want three strikers in his side that will feel they should start in Bamford, Nketiah and Brewster.</p>
