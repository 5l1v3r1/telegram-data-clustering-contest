      <p><b>Washington</b><b>:</b> The US has warned that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) would only benefit Beijing and inflict heavy debt burden on Islamabad. Addressing a gathering at the Wilson Center, a Washington think-tank, US South Asia Assistant Secretary Alice Wells said the multi-billion-dollar project would take a toll on Pakistan’s economy, Dawn reported.</p>
      <p>Wells emphasised the CPEC was not an aid to Pakistan but a form of financing that guaranteed profits for Chinese enterprises, with little benefits for Islamabad.</p>
      <p>“The CPEC’s most expensive single project is upgrading the railway from Karachi to Peshawar. When the project was initially announced, the cost was set at $8.2 billion,” she said.</p>
      <p>But in October 2018, Pakistan’s Railways Minister announced that they had negotiated the cost down to $6.2 billion, a saving of $2 billion, she said. “He explained that Pakistan is a poor country and can’t afford this huge burden of loans,” the US diplomat said.</p>
      <p>But according to recent media reports the price had risen to $9 billion, she said. “So, why doesn’t the Pakistani public know the price for CPEC’s most expensive project or how it’s being determined?”</p>
      <p>The US diplomat pointed to the long-term effects of China’s “financing practices” and urged Islamabad to assess “the burdens that are falling on the new government”. The current debt included an estimated $15 billion to the Chinese government and $6.7 billion in Chinese commercial debt, the diplomat said. Wells asserted that China was providing loans, not grants, as the US. (IANS)</p>
