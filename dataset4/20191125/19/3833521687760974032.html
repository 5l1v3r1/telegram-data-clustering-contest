      <h1>Netflix signs lease agreement to keep NYC’s Paris Theatre open</h1>

      <p>Netflix Inc. is becoming an unlikely white knight for cinephiles.</p>
      <p>The streaming giant -- often criticized by Hollywood traditionalists for undermining the filmgoing experience -- signed a lease agreement that will keep New York’s Paris Theatre operating. The 71-year-old art-house theater, the city’s last single-screen cinema, shut down over the summer after its previous lease expired.</p>
      <p>Netflix has already been using the theater to screen “Marriage Story,” a film it produced from director Noah Baumbach. Going forward, it plans to use the midtown Manhattan theater for special events, screenings and the theatrical release of its films.</p>
