      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> fans have been having their say on Dean Smith's big selection calls for the game against Newcastle United.</p>
      <p>Jack Grealish is finally back in a Villa shirt as the skipper makes his long-awaited return to match action against Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Dean Smith, has brought Grealish straight back into the starting line-up with Trezeguet dropping out, despite scoring in the last two.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere, Tom Heaton has shaken off a calf knock of his own - sustained during the 2-1 defeat to Liverpool - as the No.1 claims his starting shirt back.</p>
      <p>Bjorn Engels misses out with Ezri Konsa again partnering Tyrone Mings at the hart of Villa's defence.</p>
      <p>Conor Hourihane also starts in midfield alongside in-form John McGinn and Douglas Luiz, the latter tasked with protecting Villa's defence. Marvelous Nakamba surprisingly drops out.</p>
      <p>We've taken a look on social media for the best of the reaction to Smith's team for the pivotal clash with the Magpies.</p>
      <p><b>@JMGilkes:</b> No Engels but have been impressed by Konsa so far. Happy to see Conor starting! Was hoping to also see Jota on the bench as another option to Trezeguet</p>
      <p><b>@MattB88:</b> Shame to see Trez dropped when he's started scoring and AEG has been a bit missing. But that streaky form must mean AEG can pop up with a cracking performance</p>
      <p><b>@AVFCChats:</b> Good to see Heaton and Grealish back! Overall a decent team, however interesting to see Trezeguet and Nakamba dropped</p>
      <p><b>@JedinaksBeard:</b> Surprised by the XI; notably Nakamba &amp; Trezeguet. Clearly Engels not close enough.</p>
      <p><b>@Reece_AV:</b> Interesting. Think Konsa has held his place deservedly and Nakamba had a below average game against Wolves so fair enough. Wouldn’t have dropped Trezeguet personally, suprised. Should have enough to do these, COYL</p>
      <p><b>@TheBrooks77:</b> Glad to see @Kortney_30 making the squad. Trez is a bit unlucky. Hourihane and Wes to score</p>
      <p><b>@DarrenM15104823:</b> Got to feel for marvellous there tbf, if we’re only playing one defensive player he’s by far the better choice</p>
      <p><b>@MattQu:</b> Hmmm. We’ve generally looked solid with Nakamba and Luiz in midfield. Hope we still dominate without both in.</p>
      <p><b>@29Barters:</b> Very surprised at no Engels. Also very surprised that Trezeguet plays instead of El-Ghazi! Must be to do with the travelling on international break, same for Nakamba. Come on you Villa boys!</p>
