      <p>Madrid: Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane expressed his admiration for Paris Saint-Germain's French international forward Kylian Mbappe in the countdown to Tuesday's Champions League clash between the two sides.<br/><br/>PSG are already assured of their place in the last 16 and beat Madrid 3-0 in their first meeting in September, while Zidane's side needs a win to assure their place in the next round.<br/><br/>Zidane said his side had "improved" since the 3-0 defeat in Paris, but insisted it was "not a rematch."<br/><br/>"We want to get the result and stay consistent, confirming our improvement. It will be interesting," he said.</p>
      <p>Zidane was also asked about Gareth Bale, who produced an impressive 25-minute cameo in Saturday's 3-1 win at home to Real Sociedad, despite being booed by the fans in the Santiago Bernabeu every time he touched the ball.<br/><br/>The coach didn't confirm whether the Welsh international would start but said the game was "important for everyone, for him, for the fans, and all of us. We need a great game. [PSG] are having a magnificent season and we know that this game will be tougher than the others."<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Real Madrid coach also admitted he was a fan of Mbappe, who many in Spain expect the Spanish club to try and sign next summer.<br/><br/>Zidane admitted he was "in love with" the young striker, but warned, "he comes here as a rival and what matters most is what my team does."</p>
