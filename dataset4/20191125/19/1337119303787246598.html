      <p>Apple’s annual holiday advertisements are designed to make people tear up, and this year’s is no different. The only noticeable change between this new commercial and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18105366/apple-holiday-commercial-animated-macbook">those from years prior</a> is the addition of Pixar’s incredibly popular <i>Up </i>theme song, part of the Oscar-winning soundtrack created by longtime Pixar collaborator and composer Michael Giacchino.</p>
      <p>It’s appropriate since Apple’s new advertising spot incorporates an <i>Up-</i>like moment at the end of the commercial. Two kids use Apple’s iPad to create a slideshow presentation of their family, including their late grandmother, and present it as a gift to their grandfather who is still mourning his wife. Pixar fans will remember that <i>Up </i>begins with a five-minute sequence showcasing Carl and Ellie falling in love with each other, their life together, and eventually Ellie’s death.</p>
      <p>Incorporating the theme could be seen as emotionally manipulative, but the result is a sweet commercial about a family trying to get through the holidays after a hard loss. <i>Up</i>’s theme song has become one of Pixar’s most iconic scores since the film’s debut in 2009. Now, on the film’s 10-year anniversary, the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Up-Theme-Song-107716974">theme has seen a resurgence thanks to a popular trend on social media platform TikTok</a>. The song is available to stream on Apple Music and Spotify.</p>
