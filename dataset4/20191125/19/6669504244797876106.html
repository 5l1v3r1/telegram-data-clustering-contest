      <p>There is no significant snow in the forecast for Kamloops, but it’s going to feel like winter from a temperature point of view this week.</p>
      <p>Environment Canada meteorologist Matt MacDonald says a big change in the weather is due today, Nov.15, when a mass of arctic air is expected to begin pushing into the region.</p>
      <p>“It will be a windy, cold day on Tuesday, getting progressively colder through the week,” he says.</p>
      <p>The city should see minus temperatures in the double digits for the first time this winter.</p>
      <p>MacDonald says the cold snap is pretty much “right on schedule” for this time of year. He says the cold, dry conditions are expected to remain well into next week, but at this point, it doesn’t appear cold weather records will be broken.</p>
      <p>Today in Kamloops, expect a mix of sun and cloud with winds to 15 km/h. A high of 2 Celsius might feel colder with a windchill of -5 C expected this morning.</p>
      <p>It should be partly cloudy tonight with a low of -7 C.</p>
      <p>The big chill starts tomorrow with a mix of sun and clouds expected along with a high of -2 C, followed by cloudy periods overnight. It’s expected to be windy, creating windchill of -5 C during the day, with a low of - 7 C tomorrow night.</p>
      <p>Clouds and wind are also in the forecast for Wednesday with a high of -1 C and a low of -9 C expected.</p>
      <p>Thursday's daytime highs are only expected to reach -3 C under sunny skies. It should remain clear overnight with a low dipping into the double digits, at -12 C expected.</p>
      <p>On Friday, expect sunny skies but chilly temperatures with a high of only -7  C expected. Friday night’s low should reach -12 C.</p>
      <p>A mix of sun and cloud is expected Saturday, with temperatures moderating a little. It should reach -5 C for the high and -9 C for the low on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Sunday should see a mix of sun and cloud with a high of -4 C.</p>
      <p>Normal temperatures this time of year in Kamloops are highs of 2 C and lows of -4 C.</p>
