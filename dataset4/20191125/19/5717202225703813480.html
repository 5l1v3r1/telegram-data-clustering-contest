      <h1>Jose Mourinho says he has spoken to Christian Eriksen over his Tottenham future</h1>
      <h2>Eriksen’s contract runs out at the end of the season.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:45:47+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho says he has already spoken to Christian Eriksen over his future at the club, as per the<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7723307/Mourinho-reveals-hes-private-chat-Eriksen-future.html"> Daily Mail.</a></p>
      <p>Eriksen’s contract expires at the end of the season and there is no sign of him extending it, but Mourinho’s view on the talks appear to be positive.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7723307/Mourinho-reveals-hes-private-chat-Eriksen-future.html">said of Eriksen</a>: “I’m not going to tell you what we said. Just me and him – and Amazon. He’s committed, loves the club and is one of us.”</p>
      <p>Eriksen has been poor so far this season, playing like a man who wants to leave, but Mourinho clearly feels there is still some fire in his belly.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s View – Mourinho shouldn’t be building around Eriksen</h3>
      <p>Mourinho should use Dele Alli as his creative fulcrum until Eriksen commits his future to the club on a long-term basis.</p>
      <p>Tottenham have to get away from relying on players who have not committed their future to the club and Eriksen is the worst offender on that score.</p>
      <p>It might be a test of Mourinho’s management skills to manage the Eriksen season, either getting a tune out of him for the time he’s there or cutting him out of the picture in a way which doesn’t upset the rest of the squad.</p>
