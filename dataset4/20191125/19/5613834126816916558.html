      <p>The violent battle between the heroes of <b>“The Walking Dead”</b> and the villainous Whisperers has been put on hold following last night’s mid-season finale, and we’ve learned today that the series will be returning to AMC for the back half of season 10 on <b>February 23, 2020</b>.</p>
      <p>The mid-season finale sent Michonne off on a boat in search of weapons and trapped several beloved characters in a cave with Alpha’s own personal horde of hungry walkers, and we’ll be picking up those storylines come February. In the meantime, you can whet your appetite for what’s coming with the official teaser trailer for season 10’s second half down below.</p>
