      <p>The impact of the Conservative government’s flagship <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/universal-credit/">Universal Credit</a> benefit system has proven to be incredibly controversial.</p>
      <p>It’s divided opinion and sparked fiery debate both in Westminster and the streets of Britain.</p>
      <p>So what are the main parties planning to do with the benefits system if elected into power on December 12?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Conservatives</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Tories say they will continue to roll out Universal Credit across the country despite widespread criticism, arguing it has transformed the ‘impossibly complex’ old system.</p>
      <p>But they are ending a freeze on benefits, expected to result in an extra 1.7 per cent in money people receive from April next year.</p>
      <p>In a bid to stop people going through the system for an unreasonable amount of time, the Tories have vowed to reduce the number of reassessments for disabled claimants.</p>
      <p>They have pledged to ‘do more to make sure that Universal Credit works for the most vulnerable’ but have not gone into much detail as to how.</p>

        <b>Labour</b>

      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has vowed to completely scrap Universal Credit, which critics say has led to a rise in homelessness and food bank use.</p>
      <p>If elected, Labour says it will start developing ‘an alternative system that treats people with dignity and respect’ to ‘end poverty by guaranteeing a minimum standard of living’.</p>
      <p>The party promises to end the five-week wait for first time payments by introducing an interim payment based on half an estimated monthly entitlement.</p>
      <p>Labour also wants to scrap the benefit cap and the two child limit, which they say will ‘stop 300,000 children from being in poverty’.</p>

        <b>Liberal Democrats</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Lib Dems have promised to reform Universal Credit to be ‘more supportive for the self-employed’.</p>
      <p>Leader Jo Swinson has pledged £6 billion per year to ‘make the benefits system work for people who need it’.</p>
      <p>They want to replace the current system with an incentive-based one and to remove the benefits cap and two child limit.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems also want to reduce the five-week wait to just five days.</p>

        <b>Green Party </b>
      </p>
      <p>Co-leaders Siân Berry and Jonathan Bartley have promised a Universal Basic Income (UBI) by 2025.</p>
      <p>It would see adults receiving a minimum of £89 per week with additional payments going to those facing barriers into work, such as disabled people and single parents.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The party says this will ‘create more jobs than ever before’ and raise the income of someone working full time on minimum wage by 32 per cent.</p>
      <p>Housing benefit and carers will continue being paid to whoever received it before UBI was introduced.</p>

        <b>Brexit Party</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nigel Farage says the current Universal Credit system has ‘not achieved what was intended’ and  ‘needs to be revisited’.</p>
      <p>In its ‘contract with the people, the party vows to ‘support those who have paid into the system with an accelerated payment process’ – with a maximum wait of five weeks.</p>
      <p>The party promises a 12 month review of Universal Credit and to bring in reforms in less than two years.</p>
      <p>It also wants to ‘extend the use of dormant funds to support civil society’.</p>
