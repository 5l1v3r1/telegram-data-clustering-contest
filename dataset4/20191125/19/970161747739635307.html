      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>’s childish handwriting has been taken from his press conference notes and adapted into a free downloadable font.</p>
      <p>Last week, Trump’s bold, loopy penmanship could be seen as he read from handwritten notes during an impromptu press conference outside the White House on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Trump was responding to explosive impeachment testimony given by US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland. Sondland said last Wednesday that there was ‘quid pro quo’ – an implied favor for a favor – when Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter’s links to Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma.</p>
      <p>The bizarre press conference, which saw Trump proclaim the impeachment inquiry which could end his presidency ‘is all over,’ was made even more strange when Trump began to read from notes he appeared to have written in a thick black felt-tip marker.</p>

      <p>Now, anyone can pretend to write emboldened impeachment defenses – just like the president – after a graphic designer turned Trump’s Sharpie scrawl into a downloadable font.</p>

      <p>Mark Davis, a typographer and designer with Buzzfeed and the Font Bureau, developed the font called ‘Tiny Hand’ after a satirical article written by James Hannaham poked fun at Trump’s notes, which were written in all capital letters.</p>
      <p>The font was originally created for a fake Trump memo featured in the article and the handwriting was later analyzed in an article by Buzzfeed Art Director Ben King.</p>
      <p>King wrote: ‘I was struck not only by the peculiar delivery of the notes, but also by the idiosyncratic way Trump writes the alphabet.’</p>
      <p>‘At that moment it was clear to me – as it surely must be to you, dear reader – I had to make a font based on Donald Trump’s handwriting,’ he continued.</p>

      <p>That decision would be the birth of the Tiny Hands font, which invites the reader to scream the words on the page, just like the US Commander-in-Chief.</p>
      <p>Tiny hands is a reference to the president’s supposedly small palms, with Trump rumored to be extremely sensitive about jokes at the expense of their size.</p>
