      <h1>Unai Emery's time is up at Arsenal and Diego Simeone would be the perfect replacement</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal could - and should - have gone for Diego Simeone when Arsene Wenger left and they must now try and lure him to the Premier League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Stan Collymore, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/stan-collymore/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal needed revolution after Arsene Wenger left.</p>
      <p>They needed someone to be bold, brave, rid the walls of the stench of average, and to take a hammer to the place.</p>
      <p>Instead they got Unai Emery who is struggling to stop Arsenal being a Barcelona-light parody act from 2009.</p>
      <p>The Arsenal board should now be testing Diego Simeone’s ambition and offering him the chance to test himself against Klopp, Mourinho and Pep.</p>
      <p>It is always tough for a manager succeeding a dynasty like Wenger. It could even be two or three bosses down the line who succeeds.</p>

      <p>Do Arsenal want to keep playing nice continental passing football... I keep recalling Patrice Evra calling them nice boys.</p>
      <p>Or do you want teams turning up at the Emirates thinking: We’re not going to win here. This is a nasty place to come. Nice boys passing, or be an aggressive front-foot side.</p>
      <p>Forget going to Germany or Italy for a new manager, with Simeone they have a chance by saying, you have plateaued, eight years in Madrid, we will double your wages, we can parachute you in to compete against Mourinho, Klopp, Pep.</p>

      <p>You need a guy with sheer force of will. Klopp has done it at Liverpool. Turning into a modern version of Shankly and their legendary managers.</p>
      <p>Emery came in to much fanfare after doing exceptionally well at Sevilla, winning Europa Leagues, but his last job at PSG wasn’t fantastic. You can judge him on two things: his signings and his style of play.</p>
      <p>A style of play will take three years to change and get bedded down because Arsenal were basically Barcelona light. They were a parody act of Barca 2009-11.</p>

      <p>Fans should understand to unravel 20 years of coaching, philosophy and staff takes a revolution.</p>
      <p>It takes the board and a brave manager to say ‘right here we go we are going to do something completely different, we are going to give this man a remit to change things’.</p>
      <p>To make that revolution happen the man would be Simeone. He was mooted a few years back the first time Wenger was supposed to be leaving.</p>
      <p>He has the hard working attitude and force of character to change that squad. Emery was never going to be a revolutionary.</p>

      <p>They brought him in because he plays attractive on-the-deck football. What Arsenal needed was someone to come in and rip it up and create a new identity.</p>
      <p>In recent days Emery’s communication has been mocked, and that has been casual xenophobia with people taking the p*** out of his dialect and pronunciation.</p>
      <p>People are saying to Arsenal fans that this guy is a parody, a comic, a cartoon. When that sets in he has lost it. There is no way he can turn it back.</p>
      <p>The answer is in the next two or three weeks, they will get a draw somewhere and the board will pull the trigger.</p>
      <p>Simeone doesn’t speak any English, he signed a long term contract when Atletico Madrid moved into a new stadium, and he seems to be there for the long haul. But unless you ask the question the answer will always be no.</p>

      <p>His stock may not be as high as it was two or three years ago but you’d have a manager who is currently bossing a club that is an identikit of Arsenal – third biggest in their league, third most successful, in a new stadium, looking for the next level.</p>
      <p>He has a history of getting Atletico Madrid into finals, and if they get him now, at slightly less than his peak, he won’t cost a Jose Mourinho-style salary.</p>
      <p>They should - with permission - send the owners over to meet him and say: We know you don’t really fancy leaving Madrid, but here is a vision for you of the potential of Arsenal Football Club.</p>
      <p>He would fit what Arsenal need almost perfectly.</p>
