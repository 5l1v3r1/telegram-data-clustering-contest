      <p>The six-person shortlist for the 2019 BBC Sports Personality of the Year award has been revealed.</p>
      <p>Here, the PA news agency takes a closer look at the nominees.</p>
      <h3>Ben Stokes</h3>

      <p>The inclusion of the all-rounder will come as a surprise to no-one after he played a starring role in England’s Cricket World Cup triumph on home soil before producing another impressive display in the third Ashes Test at Headingley to help salvage a series draw. A superb one-handed catch against South Africa in the World Cup opener set the tone for a memorable summer to come but it was his knock of 84 not out in the final and subsequent performance in the super over that earned him hero status.</p>
      <h3>Dina Asher-Smith</h3>

      <p>The 23-year-old made history at this year’s World Championships in Doha as she became the first British woman to win a global sprint title on her way to claiming a hat-trick of medals. Her gold medal in the 200m and silvers in the 100m and 4x100m relay made her the first Briton to win three medals at a World Championships.</p>
      <h3>Raheem Sterling</h3>

      <p>The Manchester City and England forward shone as his club retained their Premier League title in the 2018-19 campaign, contributing 17 goals and 10 assists. Sterling also took home FA Cup and League Cup medals last term as City secured a domestic treble and was a star performer for England.</p>
      <h3>Alun Wyn Jones</h3>
