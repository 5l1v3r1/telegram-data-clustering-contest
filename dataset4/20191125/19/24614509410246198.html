      <h1>Must-Know Levels for Dollar Tree’s Earnings Reaction</h1>
      <h2>Dollar Tree stock is rallying ahead of earnings, but are bulls getting ahead of themselves?</h2>

      <p><b>Dollar Tree</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/dltr-stock-quote/"><b><u>DLTR</u></b></a>) stock is rallying on Monday, up over 3% as investors are apparently optimistic ahead of the company’s third-quarter results. Currently near $112.50, investors are wondering if Dollar Tree stock can break to new highs over $119.71. If shares pull back, where will support come into play?</p>

      <p>Monday’s action is going to cause many investors — longs and shorts — to hold their breath a bit. On the one hand, before Monday’s 3%-plus rally, DLTR stock was struggling.</p>
      <p>Shown in the chart below, shares were trapped under downtrend resistance (purple line) and were struggling to find support from the 100-day moving average. The momentum-measuring MACD indicator (blue circle) wasn’t suggesting that bulls’ had a lot of control, either. On the plus side, though, Dollar Tree stock was holding up above the 200-day moving average.</p>
      <p>Let’s take a closer look at the charts.</p>
      <h3>Trading Dollar Tree Stock</h3>

      <p>All of these factors are being jumbled ahead of earnings. The pre-earnings rally in Dollar Tree stock sent shares well over downtrend resistance and is flipping the MACD indicator into bulls’ favor. Now shares are flirting with the 50-day moving average.</p>
      <p>All of this may convince bulls to take a long position ahead of earnings. I’m not saying that won’t work, but in my experience, trading earnings is simply a dice roll because we don’t know the results. Heck, even if we knew the results ahead of time, the reaction isn’t always what we’d expect.</p>
      <p>That’s why I like to see the first day of post-earnings action to make my decision — long or short.</p>
      <p>On the long side, bulls need to see Dollar Tree stock hold their ground. In other words, a muted to slightly higher reaction is just fine. But it would be most ideal for DLTR stock to hold the $111.50 to $113 area. The former marks the 78.6% retracement for the one-year range. Over the latter would put DLTR stock over the 50-day moving average as well.</p>
      <p>Over $118 and the $119.71 high is on the table.</p>
      <p>On the downside, the shallower the dip, the better. $106 is an important level of support to hold, considering two pullbacks this month were gobbled up from investors at this area. Further, with the 200-day moving average at $105.62, this would be a discouraging area for bulls to lose.</p>
      <p>The bottom line: Over the 50-day moving average is good for bulls, as DLTR stock holds Monday’s gains and adds to them. Over $118 and new highs are possible. A 2% to 3% pullback and the bulls are still okay. Below the 200-day warrants caution.</p>
      <h3>Dollar Tree Earnings Expectations</h3>
      <p>Some retailers continue to do really well, while others continue to struggle mightily. For example, stores like <b>Macy’s</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/m-stock-quote/"><b><u>M</u></b></a>) and <b>Kohl’s</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/kss-stock-quote/"><b><u>KSS</u></b></a>) <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/macys-earnings-dip-m-stock/">have done poorly</a>. Others like <b>Target</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/tgt-stock-quote/"><b><u>TGT</u></b></a>) stock <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/target-earnings-shoot-tgt-stock-higher/">reported solid numbers</a> and traded well. <b>Walmart</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/wmt-stock-quote/"><b><u>WMT</u></b></a>) had good results, but <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/walmart-wmt-stalled-holidays-push-higher/">failed to hold its new highs</a>.</p>
      <p>I am looking for decent results out of Dollar Tree stock, and out of <b>Dollar General</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/dg-stock-quote/"><b><u>DG</u></b></a>) in early December. Even as the economy hums along, low-cost retailers are still finding demand from consumers.</p>
      <p>Last quarter, DLTR rallied on better-than-expected earnings, revenue, and comp-store sales expectations. It wasn’t a big beat on the top and bottom lines, but management foresaw enough strength to give a boost to its full-year <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3495594-dollar-tree-plus-5-percent-broad-sales-strength">earnings and revenue outlook</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite that fact, estimates for this quarter have actually decreased over the past 90 days. Analysts expect Dollar Tree stock to earn $1.13 per share this quarter vs. expectations for $1.14 per share three months ago. Granted, this is just a penny difference, but one would have thought estimates would have increased, not decreased since the last quarter.</p>
      <p>On the revenue front, estimates call for sales of $5.74 billion, representing growth of about 3.6%.</p>
      <p>While one could make a case against Dollar Tree stock — 22 times earnings and negative year-over-year earnings growth, for example — the stock and the business do seem to have some momentum.</p>
      <p>Let’s see if the results are good enough to push DLTR stock higher. At the very least, let’s see if support can buoy the name on potential pullback. Below the 200-day and sub-$100 could be on the way, with bears snagging control of momentum in the process.</p>
