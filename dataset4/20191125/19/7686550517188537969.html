      <p>It was the first day in camp under new Wales coach Wayne Pivac as preparations started for Saturday's clash with the Barbarians.</p>
      <p>And that meant it was the first time the new coaching ticket had the chance to get out on the training paddock and take charge of a session.</p>
      <p>While attack coach Stephen Jones had already been involved during the World Cup in Japan, new forwards coach Jonathan Humphries and defence coach Byron Hayward could be seen in action.</p>
      <p>Former Wales captains Sam Warburton and Martyn Williams were also spotted in their new roles - with Warburton working as a technical advisor on the defence and breakdown and Williams taking over from Alan Phillips as team manager.</p>
      <p>There were also some new faces in the playing set-up too - with Johnny McNicholl pictured for the first time on Wales duty.</p>
      <p>Ospreys centre Scott Williams was also involved after being <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/scott-williams-called-up-wales-17315068">called up as injury cover</a> after Cardiff Blues star Willis Halaholo limped off on the weekend.</p>
      <p>There were also a few younger faces in camp - with the likes of Scarlets youngster Kieran Hardy, Cardiff Blues' Ioan Davies and Ospreys duo Dewi Lake and Tiaan-Thomas Wheeler amongst a handful of future stars invited to get a taste of life in a Wales camp.</p>
