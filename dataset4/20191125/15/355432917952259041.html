      <h1>Supreme Court won't take appeal for new trial in 'Serial' podcast case</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:13:02+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/harper-neidig" target="_blank">Harper Neidig</a></address>
      <p>The Supreme Court will not take up an appeal from Adnan Syed, the Maryland man whose murder conviction gained widespread attention through the podcast "Serial."</p>
      <p>Syed's lawyers had appealed to the Supreme Court after Maryland's Court of Appeals denied him a new trial in a 4-3 ruling in March. The Supreme Court left no comment on its decision not to take the case, nor did it reveal how many justices backed the move.</p>
      <p>Syed has been in prison for nearly 20 years after being convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life for the killing of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee in 1999.</p>
      <p>His case was examined by the popular "Serial" podcast in 2014, and has since been the subject of an HBO documentary and multiple news stories.</p>
      <p>Syed has maintained his innocence, and after questions were raised about his case in "Serial," a judge granted him a new trial in 2016, ruling that his attorney had prejudiced the outcome of the original trial by not calling to the stand an important witness.</p>
      <p>But Maryland's highest court overturned that decision earlier this year and now the Supreme Court's refusal to review his case is likely to put an end to this part of his legal saga.</p>
      <p>Syed's lawyer did not immediately respond when asked for comment.</p>
