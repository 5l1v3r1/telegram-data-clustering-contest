      <h3>BTC/USD</h3>
      <p>Bitcoin was trading in the $8,636-$8,376 area on Sunday, November 17, and closed with a small increase to $8,504. It was 6 percent down for the previous week.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, it fell off a cliff on Monday and started the new seven-day period with a drop to $8,172. The coin lost 3.9 percent of its value and almost broke below $8,000 during intraday.</p>
      <p>The 50% Fibonacci level at $8,454 cracked under bear pressure and we were already eyeing the above-mentioned level as the next line of defense.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the BTC/USD pair continued to slide and moved south to $8,119 after another attempt from sellers to push the price below $8k.</p>
      <p>The mid-week session on Wednesday proved to be no different and Bitcoin ended the day at $8,085 after moving mainly in the $8,239 -$8,035 zone.</p>
      <p>On Thursday it formed its fourth consecutive red candle and lost 5.9 percent to close at $7,611. Bears smashed through the $8k barrier as the whole crypto market was bled severely.</p>
      <p>The last day of the workweek came with yet another disappointment for buyers. The most popular cryptocurrency dropped to $7,269 and erased another $342 from its value. The BTC/USD pair was trading as low as $6,792 – its lowest since May 2019.</p>
      <p>The weekend of November 23-24 started with a little room to breathe for BTC bulls as the leading digital asset moved up to $7,320 in an effort to preserve the $7k support level.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, November 24, it lost another 6 percent and stepped down to $6,898. Bitcoin closed 19 percent lower compared to the previous 7-day period.</p>

      <h4>ETH/USD</h4>
      <p>The <a href="http://ethereum.org/">Ethereum Project</a> token ETH closed at $183.9 on Sunday, November 17 after two consecutive days of gains. Still, it was 2.9 percent down on a weekly basis.</p>
      <p>It opened trading on Monday with a sudden drop to $177. The coin lost 3.2 percent and fell below the $180 support level for the first time since October 26.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday the ETH/USD pair moved even lower and closed the session at $175. Naturally, the next support downwards was situated somewhere in the $170-$165 area.</p>
      <p>The third day of the workweek brought a third consecutive red candle for the ether and it lost more ground dropping further to $174. On Thursday, the freefall continued with an 8-percent drop, which resulted in a step down to $160.</p>
      <p>On Friday we witnessed the fifth losing session for the ETH token, which was then trading around $150. Bears were able to push price all the way down to $138 during intraday – these levels were last seen in April 2019.</p>
      <p>Trading on Saturday, November 23 was mainly in the $155-$146 area and the popular cryptocurrency regained some positions by climbing up to $152.5.</p>
      <p>The last day of the week came with another 7.9 percent drop as ETH moved down to $139. It lost 24 percent of its value on a weekly basis.</p>

      <h4>XRP/USD</h4>
      <p>The <a href="http://ripple.com/">Ripple</a> company token XRP moved up to $0.263 on Sunday, November 17, but closed the seven-day period with a 6.8 percent loss.</p>
      <p>The new trading period started with a huge drop on Monday. XRP fell all the way down to $0.24 during the early hours of the session, but managed to recover in the evening and closed with a 4.5 percent loss to $0.251.</p>
      <p>On the next day, Tuesday, November 19, it compensated for some of the losses and moved up to $0.253. Still, the downtrend was more than confirmed and the bear pressure was increasing.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday the XRP/USD pair dropped further to $0.250, and even though bulls were keeping trading close to the $0.26 support line, they did not manage to close on green territory. The coin continued to slide and made another step-down, this time to $0.243 on the fourth day of the week.</p>
      <p>The Friday session was a little catastrophic for XRP as it followed the general crypto market trend and fell to $0.23. The 5.3 percent drop resulted in a third consecutive red candle on the daily chart. The coin briefly touched $0.222 during intraday. The last time we visited that level was in September this year.</p>
      <p>The weekend of November 23-24 started with a small increase to $0.234. On Sunday, November 24, however, XRP continued with its bad performance and fell down to $0.22. It closed the week 16.3 percent lower.</p>

      <h4>Altcoin of the Week</h4>
      <p>The majority of the cryptocurrencies in the Top 100 list were brutally beaten during the last week of trading with almost all of them registering double-digit loses.</p>
      <p>Few other low-cap coins also remained below the radar; one of them is a less-known coin by the name of Synthetix Network Token (<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/synthetix-network-token">SNX</a>). As per the official <a href="https://www.synthetix.io/uploads/synthetix_litepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a>, “Synthetix is a decentralised synthetic asset issuance protocol built on Ethereum”.</p>
      <p>The project’s native token SNX enables the issuance of synthetic assets called Synths once locked in the contract and allows users to exchange them without the need of third-parties. The Synthetix.Exchange and blockchain ecosystem supports synthetic fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, and commodities.</p>
      <p>The SNX token is currently ranked at #39 on CoinGecko with a total market capitalization of approximately $109 million. It was 38 percent up on a weekly basis and gained 57 percent for the last 14 days.</p>
      <p>Synthetix peaked at $1.41 on Sunday, November 24, and is currently trading at 0.0000811 against BTC on Bittrex exchange.</p>
