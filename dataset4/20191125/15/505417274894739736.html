      <h1>Caoimhin Kelleher Could Leave Liverpool For Championship Loan Move</h1>

        <b>Caoimhin Kelleher could secure a loan move away from Liverpool in January.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Republic of Ireland Under-21 goalkeeper was part of the Liverpool squad that won the Champions League in June and has played for Jurgen Klopp’s team in the EFL Cup this season, making two appearances. He impressed on his senior debut in the victory over MK Dons in September, where he kept a clean sheet.</p>
      <p>In October, he conceded five goals in the ridiculous 5-5 draw against Arsenal at Anfield. But Kelleher made up for some shaky moments earlier in the match by saving in the penalty shootout victory.</p>

      <p>The Cork-native will be between the sticks again for Liverpool in the EFL Cup quarter-final against Aston Villa in December. However, he could then be set for a spell away from the club in the new year.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpools-plan-rhian-brewster-revealed-17310894">The Liverpool Echo</a>, <b>Preston North End</b> are interested in taking Kelleher on loan. The report claims that Liverpool will only sanction a move for the Irish goalkeeper if the loan club can guarantee that he will feature in the first-team.</p>
      <p>Preston are currently third in the Championship and Declan Rudd is their starting ‘keeper.</p>
      <p>Rhian Brewster also looks set for a loan move away from Anfield. The England underage forward is wanted by Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and Swansea City, amongst others.</p>

      <p><a href="https://punditarena.com/football/robredmond/caoimhin-kelleher-ireland-liverpool-1/">Kelleher</a> is behind Alisson Becker and Adrian in the pecking order for Liverpool but is highly rated by club and country. The 21-year-old is a modern goalkeeper, as comfortable with his feet as he is making saves.</p>
      <p>A spell away from Anfield, playing first-team football, would surely greatly benefit him at this stage of his career.</p>
