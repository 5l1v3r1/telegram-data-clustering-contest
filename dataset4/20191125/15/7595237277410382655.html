      <p>A two-year-old boy has died after an ice sculpture fell on him at Luxembourg city's Christmas market.</p>
      <p>Police said the child was severely injured in the incident which occurred yesterday and died in the ambulance.</p>
      <p>Today, the city announced all street markets would be closed for the day and an investigation has been opened.</p>
      <p>French sculptor Samuel Girault was questioned by Luxembourg police. He said his sculpture could not have fallen by itself.</p>
      <p>Mr Girault said he had 19 years' experience in carving ice and the base of the fallen work weighed two tonnes.</p>
      <p>The accident happened just metres from the ice rink at the capital city's annual Christmas fair which opened last Thursday.</p>
