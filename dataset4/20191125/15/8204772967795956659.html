      <h1>Intel welcomes green light for new $4bn plant in Leixlip</h1>
      <h2>Appeals board gives the chip giant the go-ahead for the proposed FAB project</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:35:46+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/gordon-deegan-7.1837475" target="_blank">Gordon Deegan</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Intel">Intel</a> has welcomed a decision to grant planning permission for its proposed new $4 billion (€3.63 billion) manufacturing fabrication facility at its <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Leixlip">Leixlip</a> plant and said that preliminary work on the project is already underway.</p>
      <p>The technology giant said in a statement it was progressing with the early phases of a multi-year construction programme at the site.</p>
      <p>“As always, site expansion and the related investment will be taken in stages and are subject to change based on business, economic and other factors,” a spokeswoman for the company said.</p>
      <p>Intel, which has invested $15 billion in its Leixlip site, this year marks 30 years in Ireland.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=An+Bord+Plean%C3%A1la">An Bord Pleanála</a> gave the go-ahead for the company’s proposed $4 billion project after finding that the plan would constitute a reasonable and orderly expansion of the existing manufacturing use at the location.</p>

      <p>The proposal was opposed by local farmer, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Thomas+Reid">Thomas Reid</a> who last June appealed the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Kildare+County+Council">Kildare County Council</a> decision to grant to An Bord Pleanála. Mr Reid has also lodged another objections to Intel’s site systems facilitation application.</p>
      <p>An Bord Pleanála in its decision upheld the recommendation to grant by Senior Planning inspector, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Paul+Caprani">Paul Caprani</a> at the end of his 83 page report.</p>
      <p>The application is the eighth Intel Leixlip application Mr Reid has objected to since 2012 with six previous applications brought before An Bord Pleanála by Mr Reid.</p>
      <p>Mr Reid unsuccessfully opposed the $4 billion first phase of the ‘fab’ plan in 2017 when lodging an objection against the application and then appealing the Council decision to An Bord Pleanála.</p>
      <p>Granting of planning permission comes three years after Intel secured permission for the first phase of the ‘fab’ facility valued at $4 billion.</p>
      <p>In total, the two planning permissions represent a $8 billion (€7.26 billion) investment which will employ 6,000 construction workers at peak and 1,600 full time jobs on completion.</p>
      <p>The projects represent the largest single private investment in the history of the State on one project if given the go-ahead by Intel globally.</p>
      <p>Intel, which first established operations in the Republic in 1989, when it opted to locate its European headquarters in Ireland at a former 360-acre stud farm, employs 4,900 people here.</p>
      <p>By its estimates, the company claims to contribute €1.08 billion each year to the Irish economy and supports 6,669 full time equivalent jobs.</p>
