      <p>The son of former Nottingham Forest star <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/hoping-nottingham-forest-given-transfer-3553099">Lars Bohinen</a> is reportedly attracting Premier League interest.</p>
      <p>Bohinen’s son, Emil, currently plays for Norwegian top flight outfit Stabaek JF, and is reportedly being tracked by Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old winger is considered one of the country's brightest prospects, and scored four goals in 28 appearances in the Eliteserien this season, as well as providing six assists and two more in the Norwegian cup.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11741/11870080/brighton-among-clubs-keen-on-norway-youth-star-emil-bohinen">Sky Sports</a> report says that Brighton are not expected to splash the cash during the January transfer window, but are open to completing a deal for Bohinen if possible.</p>
      <p>The youngster has also been capped four times for Norway’s Under-21 side.</p>
      <p>Former Forest midfielder Bohinen made 75 appearances for the Reds between 1993-95, before leaving the City Ground to sign for Blackburn Rovers.</p>
      <p>Bohinen also had spells at Spanish side Valerenga, Swiss club BSC Young Boys and East Midland rivals Derby County in his career.</p>

      <p>Lars thinks that his son is well suited to the rigours of Championship football.</p>
      <p>“I was hoping to bring him to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> at some point actually, I think he can manage the standard (Championship)," Lars told the <a href="https://www.chad.co.uk/sport/football/former-nottingham-forest-favourite-lars-bohinen-reflects-on-his-time-trentside-1-10110192">Mansfield and Ashfield Chad</a> last week.</p>
