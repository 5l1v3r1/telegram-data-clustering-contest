      <p>Nurse practitioners, information security analysts, and actuaries all require specialized education at a college or graduate level, and the US economy is set to add thousands of new jobs in these and other fields over the next decade or so.</p>
      <p>Every two years, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/">employment projections for the United States</a>. These estimate how many people are likely to be employed in various jobs over the next decade.</p>
      <p>The most recently released projections cover how employment is expected to change between 2018 and 2028. The projections also include typical educational requirements for each job. Using those projections, we found the 20 jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher that the BLS projects will have the fastest employment percent growth rates over the decade.</p>
      <p>Here are the jobs, along with their <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm">median annual salaries as of May 2018</a>, the most recently available data:</p>
