      <h1>‘The Addams Family’ is an Even Bigger Hit Than We Thought</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:44:05+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/mrdisgusting/" target="_blank">Brad Miska</a></address>
      <p>We already knew that United Artists and MGM’s animated retelling of <b><i>The Addams Family</i> </b>(<a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3588448/new-animated-addams-family-kooky-ooky-review/">read our review</a>) was a monstrous success, but a quick check at the recent box office numbers reveal it’s actually a <i>huge</i> hit.</p>
      <p>The last time we reported on the film, it was targeting $100M worldwide. This weekend, it shot past $175M globally and is settings its sights on $200M, albeit unlikely to reach the moon.</p>
      <p>The kicker here is that <i>The Addams Family</i>, which acts as a prequel that tells the origins of the family moving into their spooky mansion, cost <i>only</i> $25M to produce. No wonder <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3589052/addams-family-sequel-already-works/">a sequel was quickly put into development</a> and dated for 2021.</p>
      <p>In the film, <b>Charlize Theron</b> voices Morticia Addams and <b>Oscar Isaac</b> is voicing Gomez Addams, with <b>Chloe Grace Moretz</b> as Wednesday Addams. The cast also includes <b>Finn Wolfhard</b> as Pugsley Addams, <b>Nick Kroll</b> as Uncle Fester, <b>Bette Midler</b> as Grandmama, <b>Allison Janney</b> as Margaux Needler, and<b> Elsie Fisher</b> as Parker Needler, the daughter of Margaux.</p>
