      <h1>Adamis shares slump as FDA declines to approve opioid overdose treatment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:10:46+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:10</time> by <a rel="author">Shivani Singh</a></address>
      <p>(Reuters) - Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/ADMP.O">ADMP.O</a>) said on Monday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration declined to approve its opioid overdose treatment, Zimhi, sending its shares plunging 56%.</p>
      <p>In a so-called complete response letter (CRL), the FDA questioned the treatment’s chemistry, manufacturing and controls process, but not its safety or effectiveness, the company said.</p>
      <p>The drug is a naloxone pre-filled single dose syringe used for emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose, and investors hoped the treatment would help the San Diego-based company reduce its reliance on its emergency allergy shot, Symjepi.</p>
      <p>Adamis Pharmaceuticals had revenue of about $5.9 million in the third quarter, a 54% jump from a year earlier on Symjepi demand.</p>
      <p>Maxim Group analyst Jason McCarthy in a note, ahead of FDA’s decision, estimated Zimhi to bring in peak sales of $70.8 mln in 2028.</p>
      <p>“We believe the comments and recommendations stated in the CRL are manageable and plan to fully cooperate with the FDA,” Adamis Chief Executive Dennis Carlo said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The company said it will request a meeting with the FDA “as soon as reasonably possible” and plans to resubmit its application for approval.</p>
      <p>Adamis is seeking to use Zimhi, which delivers high doses of naloxone, as part of the fight against the opioid crisis in the United States.</p>
      <p>Opioids were involved in nearly 400,000 overdose deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services last December had recommended prescribing or co-prescribing naloxone to high-risk patients for opioid overdose.</p>
      <p>The company’s shares were at 54 cents in morning trading. They had fallen 44% this year, through Friday’s close.</p>
