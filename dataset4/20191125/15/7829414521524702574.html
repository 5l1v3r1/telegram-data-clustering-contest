      <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent congratulatory letters Monday on the first meeting of the China-Japan high-level consultation mechanism on people-to-people and cultural exchanges in Tokyo.<br/><br/>In his letter, Xi noted China and Japan are close neighbors enjoying deep historical and cultural connections. In their exchanges lasting for more than 2,000 years, the two peoples have learned from each other, which has not only promoted their respective development, but also contributed to the progress of Asian civilizations.<br/><br/>The world has been going through profound changes unseen in a century, and humankind cannot address common challenges and strive towards a bright future without the power of culture, Xi said, adding people of all countries in the world should grasp and conform to the trend of the times and deepen exchanges to write a new chapter of human civilizations together.<br/><br/>Xi stressed that currently, China-Japan relations have been continuously improving. He said he hopes China and Japan can make good use of the mechanism to promote people-to-people and cultural exchanges and foster better understanding between their people, so as to provide cultural and popular support for the building and development of China-Japan relations that fit the needs of the new era.<br/><br/>Abe, in his letter, said the high-level consultation mechanism is from a consensus he reached with Xi in their meeting in Osaka this June, with an aim of deepening mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples through broad exchanges.<br/><br/>Abe said he hopes the mechanism can consolidate the foundation of public opinion for the building of Japan-China relations that fit the needs of the new era, and contribute to opening up a new future for bilateral ties.<br/><b>RELATED ARTICLES:</b></p>
