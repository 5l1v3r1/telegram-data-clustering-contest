      <p>New Westminster’s favourite street party is returning, and it’s feeling festive.</p>
      <p><a href="https://downtownnewwest.ca/Events/Public/Fridays-on-Front-Holiday-Edition">Fridays on Front: the Holiday Edition</a> returns on Friday, Dec. 13 from 5 to 9 p.m. Everyone’s invited to join in fun under the parkade on Front Street.</p>
      <p>Fridays on Front features a lineup of fan-favourite food trucks – including such faves as Mo Bacon, Frying Pan, Boca’o, Cannoli King, Bread and Cheese and Mr. Arancino, just to name a sampling.</p>
      <p>You’ll also be able to sip on mulled wine by Pacific Breeze Winery and enjoy award-winning local beer by Steel &amp; Oak, all while you browse through the New West Craft artisan holiday market.</p>
      <p>There will also be fun, family-friendly activities. And, since it wouldn’t be a Christmas market without music, the Arts Council of New Westminster will be on hand to provide the holiday tunes.</p>
