      <h3>China Chokes the Crypto Ecosystem</h3>
      <p>China’s stance on digital currencies continues to see-saw between yes and no, as according to a freshly issued official report, the Chinese financial watchdogs have shut down all digital currency exchange platforms in the country.</p>

      <p>The shocking move comes shortly after <a href="https://btcmanager.com/china-national-cryptocurrency-dcep/?q=/china-national-cryptocurrency-dcep/&amp;">reports</a> began to float around in the cryptospace suggesting that China is very close to launching its own central bank digital currency (CBDC). Reportedly, the yet-to-be-launched stablecoin will be pegged to the Chinese yuan and tested with commercial banks during its first phase of launch.</p>
      <h4>Digging Deeper into the Development</h4>
      <p>While the latest development comes as a jolt to the global crypto space, it’s worth noting that, according to some Twitter users, the report shared by @cnLedger only comprises of data and figures until 2018. Hence, people are advised to take the report with a pinch of salt.</p>

        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/ETCConsortium/status/1198940112844816384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>Also, considering the fact that the report only talks about exchanges and cryptocurrency trading platforms based on data until 2018, it doesn’t explain how large digital currency exchanges like Huobi and OKEx are still able to function out of China.</p>
      <h4>China’s On-Off Crypto Love</h4>
      <p>Today, a large number of countries across the globe are actively trying to form regulatory frameworks that pave the way for a healthy and competitive local crypto industry. Some of the global leaders in this space include the likes of <a href="https://btcmanager.com/small-nations-crypto-startups-regulations/">Malta</a>, <a href="https://btcmanager.com/bitcoin-sentiment-shines-turkey-diminishes-europe/">Turkey</a>, <a href="https://btcmanager.com/economic-and-political-uncertainty-boost-bitcoin-price-in-argentina-and-hong-kong/">Argentina</a>, and others.</p>
      <p>That said, several large economies across the world are yet not sold on the idea and utility of digital currencies; and perhaps, the leading and the largest economy with anti-crypto sentiment is China itself.</p>
      <p><i>BTCManager</i> <a href="https://btcmanager.com/blockchain-crypto-chinese-state-media-decentralized-technology-utility/?q=/blockchain-crypto-chinese-state-media-decentralized-technology-utility/&amp;">reported</a> on November 4, 2019, how Chinese state media <i>People’s Daily</i> had published an article highlighting the benefits of blockchain technology and the cons of cryptocurrencies.</p>
      <p>China’s negative stance toward cryptocurrencies took a dramatic turn this week when reports out of the country emerged stating that Chinese police had raided Binance’s Shanghai office. The reports were later <a href="https://btcmanager.com/binance-denies-office-shanghai-raided-police/?q=/binance-denies-office-shanghai-raided-police/&amp;">refuted</a> by the Malta-based exchange.</p>
