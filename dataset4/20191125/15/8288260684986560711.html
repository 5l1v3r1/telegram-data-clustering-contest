      <h2>West Bromwich Albion transfer latest | The Baggies have offered Nathan Ferguson a new long-term contract - but</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:21:08+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:21</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Murray</a></address>
      <p>West Bromwich Albion could reportedly consider selling starlet Nathan Ferguson to a Premier League suitor to avoid him heading abroad at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old defender has been one of the big success stories of an eye-catching start to the season at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">the Hawthorns,</a> making 13 appearances to date in his maiden Championship campaign.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nathan-ferguson">Ferguson's</a> current contract expires in the summer, and he has been <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/nathan-ferguson-update-delight-west-17098931">offered a new five-year deal.</a></p>
      <p>Should Ferguson move abroad, the Baggies will reportedly only be entitled to around £300,000 compensation under FIFA guidelines - with Atletico Madrid and Juventus among the European clubs linked.</p>

      <p>He would be available to interested Premier League parties Tottenham Hotspur and Crystal Palace for free at the end of the season if he is out of contract.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10408812/west-brom-worried-nathan-ferguson-abroad-end-season/">According to the Sun,</a> that is why Albion may consider a January sale to either Palace or Spurs - both said to be keen - as the versatile defender would command a greater fee.</p>
      <p>But the Baggies ultimately are still hopeful of keeping hold of the teenager past the January window and into the future as they look to cement their place in the Championship's top two.</p>
