      <h1>Jamal Adams Gets In Twitter Beef With Derek Carr’s Brother: ‘Stop Living Through Your Brothas’ (TWEETS)</h1>

      <p>Jamal Adams was fired up after Sunday’s game against the Oakland Raiders.</p>
      <p>The New York Jets safety had seven tackles and a half-sack, giving him 6.5 sacks over the last four games.</p>
      <p>To celebrate, Adams took to Twitter and posted a photo of him and teammates sacking Raiders QB Derek Carr. That prompted Carr’s brother, Darren, to comment under it.</p>

      <p>Adams told him to frame it, to which Darren responded by posting photos of Adams getting burned for a TD by then-New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski.</p>

      <p>Adams then decided to hit below the belt and get personal by bringing up Carr’s high school job.</p>

      <p>Darren wanted no more action as he tried to play victim in his response, but Adams wasn’t having it.</p>

      <p>Adams didn’t start it, but he definitely finished it.</p>
      <p>New York will go on the road next game against the Cincinnati Bengals.</p>
