      <p>As <a href="https://www.cbr.com/all-justice-league-stars-demanded-release-snyder-cut/">Batman and Wonder Woman</a> themselves lend support to the fan-backed push to release Zack Snyder's original cut of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/justice-league-film/"><i>Justice League</i></a>, further details about the extensive reshoots involved in the final film are coming to light.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/movies/snyder-cut-gadot-affleck.html"><i>The New York Times</i></a>, after screening Snyder's cut for a group of filmmakers, "Warner Bros. hired [Joss] Whedon to helm a substantial round of reshoots that included almost 80 new script pages." Those new pages reportedly included more screentime for Gal Gadot, Amy Adams and Diane Lane, less screentime for Ezra Miller and Ray Fisher and more jokes in an attempt to capture the lightning in a bottle Whedon employed with the first <i>Avengers</i> film.</p>

      <p>Despite Whedon's significant rewrites, <i>Justice League</i> was a critical and commercial failure, with a box office of just $658 million off of an estimated $300 million budget. That said, the rumored Snyder Cut, teased by the director in the years since the film's release, would likely cost a significant sum to complete, given the special effects that had yet to be <a href="https://www.cbr.com/diane-nelson-snyder-cut-support-unfinished/">added to the final film</a>. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/justice-league-snyder-cut-warner-bros-no-plans/">Warner Bros. no longer</a> appears to be particularly invested in its shared universe, instead concentrating on standalone films like <i>Shazam!</i>,<i> Aquaman </i>and the upcoming <i>Wonder Woman 1984</i> and <a href="https://screenrant.com/the-batman-casting-justice-league-dceu-response/amp/"><i>The Batman</i></a>.</p>
      <p><i>Justice League</i>, originally released in 2017, features Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Ben Affleck as Batman, Henry Cavill as Superman, Jason Momoa as Aquaman, Ezra Miller as The Flash, and Ray Fisher as Cyborg.</p>
