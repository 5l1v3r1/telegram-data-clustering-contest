      <h1>St. FX to review Mulroney plaque after complaint it's offensive to tradespeople</h1>

      <p>ANTIGONISH, N.S. - The president of St. Francis Xavier University has apologized to anyone offended by a plaque in the Brian Mulroney Institute of Government that includes a quote from the former prime minister's father.</p>
      <p>The quote, based on a conversation Mulroney had with his father Benedict in 1955, reads: "The only way out of a paper mill town is through a university door."</p>
      <p>At the time, a young Mulroney was planning to seek an apprenticeship at the mill in Baie-Comeau, Que., where his father worked as electrician -- but the elder Mulroney was opposed to the idea and encouraged his son to attend St. FX.</p>
      <p>However, one of the Nova Scotia university's former students recently posted a message on Facebook, saying she was offended by the plaque because it appears to devalue tradespeople and creates the impression that mill towns are "impoverished and embarrassing."</p>
      <p>Meaghan Landry, who is originally from Cape Breton, says tradespeople play an important role in the economy, and she said a paper mill has provided her with employment -- and well-paying jobs for her father and her partner.</p>
      <p>Kevin Wamsley, the president of the university, issued a statement Friday saying he will be reviewing the issue with the university's executive council.</p>
