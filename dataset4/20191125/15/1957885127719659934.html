      <p>Square Enix has detailed more of its changes coming to the Final Fantasy 7 Remake - including the addition of new characters and boss battles.</p>
      <p>And, somewhat unsurprisingly, the developer has confirmed work is already underway on the Remake's next chapter. (This first one is expected to focus primarily on Midgar.)</p>
      <p>"With regard to new characters," director Tetsuya Nomura said in a new <a href="https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-developers">blog post</a>, "of whom I said during past interviews that there would be 'none' - though they aren't main characters, their numbers ended up growing considerably in the process of creating a rich depiction of Midgar.</p>

      <p>"When you think of Midgar's final boss, you probably think of the M.O.T.O.R., but in this game new bosses will appear and add to the excitement of the story even more.</p>
      <p>"We've already begun working on the next one as well, but I'm confident that playing through this title will expand your expectations just like the world that extends beyond Midgar."</p>
      <p>A host of new screenshots released today gives us a good look at Midgar, Aerith's house, and a glimpse at the new weapon upgrade interface.</p>
