      <p><b>Mumbai</b>: Even as political drama continues to flummox Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis on Monday reached Mantralaya, the state secretariat, and took charge of the chief minister's office.</p>
      <p>The first thing that the 49-year-old did was signing a cheque for the CM Relief Fund. Fadnavis handed the cheque to Kusum Vengurlekar. “CM Devendra Fadnavis’ first signature of this tenure was done on a CM Relief Fund cheque, on reaching Mantralaya, which was handed over to Kusum Vengurlekar by the Chief Minister”, tweeted CMO Maharashtra.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Senior NCP leader and Deputy CM Ajit Pawar also assumed charge amid the ongoing protest by the Opposition over this 'illegitimate government'.</p>
      <p>At the Vidhan Bhawan, CM Fadnavis and his deputy Pawar paid tribute to former Maharashtra Chief Minister Yashwantrao Balwantrao Chavan on his death anniversary, before taking the charge of the office.</p>

      <p>Fadnavis assumed office, hours after the Supreme Court gave a breather to the Fadnavis-Ajit government by reserving its order on a petition challenging the surprise government formation by the BJP for tomorrow.</p>
      <p>In a dramatic turn of events, BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis, with the help of a faction of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLAs led by Ajit Pawar stake claim to form government in Maharashtra and in an early morning ceremony, took oath as the chief minister.</p>
