      <p>The leaves have fallen, a chill is in the air (as is pumpkin spice) — it’s <b>Thanksgiving</b> time again in NYC. For a lot of folks it’s also a long weekend, and even though this week is traditionally not overflowing with live entertainment options, there’s always something worth going to see any night in NYC. Whether you’re visiting the city or you live here and are sticking around town, here are nearly 30 music events worth checking out from Wednesday through Sunday.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 27</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/aap-rocky-playing-thanksgiving-eve-show-in-brooklyn/"><b>A$AP Rocky @ Avant Gardner<br/></b></a>The last time NYC rapper A$AP Rocky played his hometown was <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/rolling-loud-2019-sunday-pics-aap-rocky-pusha-t-lil-uzi-vert-more/">headlining Rolling Loud</a> and the whole A$AP Mob is set for <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/aap-mob-announce-yams-day-2020/">Yams Day 2020</a> in January, but you can see Rocky at a way more intimate location than both of those on Thanksgiving Eve. There will also be music from DJ Spade, DJ Clue, DJ Moma, DJ Boof, and Odalys.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/bob-dylan-began-10-show-beacon-theatre-run-videos-setlist/"><b>Bob Dylan @ Beacon Theatre (Also Friday and Saturday)</b></a><br/>The great Bob Dylan continues his intimate ten-night run at Beacon Theatre with his band which, if previous nights’ setlists (which have been pretty much the same) are any indication, includes lots of favorites.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nationalsawdust.org/event/ben-goldberg/"><b>Ben Goldberg @ National Sawdust</b></a><br/>Part of John Zorn’s Commissioning Series that celebrates his venue The Stone, clarinetist and composer Ben Goldberg plays this special show tonight accompanied by Ches Smith (vibraphone), Kenny Wollesen (vibraphone), Ryan Ferreira (electric guitar), Thomas Morgan (bass), and Michael Coleman (keyboards).</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.union-pool.com/e/get-stuffed-pre-thanksgiving-dance-party-83367706053/"><b>Get Stuffed Pre-Thanksgiving Dance Party @ Union Pool</b></a><br/>WFMU’s Todd-o-Phonic Todd is throwing this second-annual pre-Thanksgiving party featuring fellow DJs Bailey, Reyes Rodriguez and Heavy Flow, spinning 45s of garage, soul, girl groups and more.

      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/judy-collins-preps-new-lp-ft-chatham-county-line-touring-playing-joes-pub-residency/"><b>Judy Collins, Chatham County Line, Jonas Fjeld @ Joe’s Pub</b></a><br/>Folk icon Judy Collins released her latest LP <i>Winter Stories</i> last week, which she created with collaborators Jonas Fjeld and Chatham County Line. The three wrap up an eight-show residency at Joe’s Pub tonight performing songs off the new album, which includes originals and covers of Joni Mitchell, Jimmy Webb, and more.</p>
      <p>
        <b>THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 28 (THANKSGIVING DAY)</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.macys.com/social/parade/lineup/performers/"><b>The Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade</b></a><br/>Most New Yorkers watch the parade like the rest of the country, on TV while sitting on their couch and getting dinner prepped. Whether you’re there in person or chilling at home in your jammies, Black Eyed Peas, Celine Dion, TLC, Chicago, Ciara, Debbie Gibson, Kelly Rowland, and more will perform. The weather forecast of heavy winds may keep the balloons from being flown this year, though.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/record-store-day-announces-rsd-black-friday-2019-exclusive-titles/"><b>Record Store Day Black Friday</b></a><br/>It’s not quite as big as the Record Store Day that happens in April, but the now annual RSD Black Friday does offer a bunch of exclusive, limited edition releases, including Jonathan Fire*Eater‘s 1997 album <i>Wolf Songs For Lambs</i> on vinyl for first time in 20 years, The Wrens’ album <i>Silver</i> on vinyl for the first time ever, plus records by Cardi B, Lizzo, Arcade Fire, Nas, Devo, Pylon, They Might Be Giants and more.You can find RSD Black Friday titles at your local independent record store (Rough Trade in Brooklyn will probably have the most stuff).</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/tours-announced-alice-cooperlita-ford-budos-band-kevin-barnes-fleshtones-more/"><b>The Fleshtones &amp; Lenny Kaye @ Rough Trade</b> </a><br/>Speaking of Rough Trade, part of their RSD Black Friday celebration will be a free performance by NYC garage rock royalty The Fleshtones who will be accompanied by Patti Smith Band guitarist Lenny Kaye. They’ll be signing copies of their RSD 7″ after the performance. 3 PM and free.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/beach-rats-speedy-ortiz-restorations-playing-house-of-independents-4th-anniversary/"><b>Beach Rats, Speedy Ortiz, Restorations, American Trappist, Well Wisher @ House of Independents</b></a><br/>Not only is it Thanksgiving Weekend, but Asbury Park venue House of Independents is celebrating something too: their fourth anniversary. They’ve put together this great lineup for the occasion, including three pretty big names in indie/punk: punk supergroup Beach Rats (Lifetime, Bouncing Souls, Minor Threat, etc), indie rockers Speedy Ortiz, and heartland punks Restorations. The all-around solid bill is rounded out by American Trappist (members of River City Extension) and indie-punk newcomers Well Wisher.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/12-nyc-holiday-shows-to-see-this-year-including-she-him-win-tix/">Darlene Love: “Love For The Holidays” @ Sony Hall</a><br/></b>The incomparable Darlene Love, whose voice helped make <i>A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector</i> the classic that it is, returns to NYC for her annual run of holiday shows happening at Sony Hall. As far as holiday voices go, it doesn’t get much better than this.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/mercury-lounge/aap-twelvyy-friends-at-mercury-lounge/751434148636061/"><b>A$AP Twelvyy &amp; Friends @ Mercury Lounge</b></a><br/>A$AP Rocky on Thanksgiving Eve isn’t enough A$AP Mob this weekend? No worries, A$AP Twelvyy and a bunch of friends (Billz Raw, Russ, Lago 2.0, Bindo, Smoove Aura, Yung Lunchbox, Zay Nailer, Hassi Irv, A Gem, 27Delly, Jay Blue) will hit Mercury Lounge on Friday. Rocky and Ferg may still be A$AP Mob’s biggest names, but Twelvyy has been putting out some <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/dead-cross-asap-twelvyy-limp-wrist-girl-ray-accept-reviews/">pretty great music of his own</a> over the past couple years and he remains on the rise.</p>
      <p><a href="http://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/259789/264167/4272?u=https://www.ticketmaster.com/artist/735297?camefrom=cfc_town_hall_social&amp;brand=townhall&amp;venueId=24622"><b>Hot Tuna @ Town Hall (Friday and Saturday)</b></a><br/>Hot Tuna live in NYC is a Thanksgiving tradition, and this year they’re doing the Friday and Saturday after the holiday at Town Hall. Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady (both famously also of Jefferson Airplane) tour constantly, and it’s kept them well-oiled machines for their entire 50+ year professional careers. If you’ve been to a Tuna show, you don’t need us to tell you to catch these, but if you’ve never seen them before, it’s still very worth it. The Grateful Dead and Phish might finally be reaching the indie rock crowd lately, but Jorma and Jack go all the way back with the Dead to the Haight-Ashbury days and Hot Tuna remain a fiery jam band today.</p>

Even if no surprises happen at this one, hearing him do the album’s songs is reason enough to go.</p>

Head to Ridgewood venue Trans-Pecos to see what magic he has in store for NYC this weekend.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.unionhallny.com/e/andy-kindler-live-and-loaded-early-show--67599147871/"><b>Andy Kindler @ Union Hall (2 shows)</b></a><br/>Stand-up vet Andy Kindler has appeared just about everywhere from Letterman to Fallon, and you may also know him from Bob’s Burgers (he voices Mort) or <i>But I’m Chris Jericho</i>.</p>

      <p><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/artists/bridget-everett-and-the-tender-moments"><b>Bridget Everett &amp; The Tender Moments @ Joe’s Pub (Also Sunday)</b> </a><br/>Backed by her band The Tender Moments, Bridget Everett provides an extremely unexpurgated night of comedy and music that may not be for the easily embarrassed.</p>

It’s a great record that finds them still exploring new sounds, and Cattle Decapitation have also put together an incredible tour package to celebrate it. This show also has Florida tech-death legends Atheist, grind/noise/etc greats Full of Hell, modern industrial staple Author &amp; Punisher, and Portland DMers Vitriol, making for a great show all around. It starts on the early side (5:30 doors, 6:30 start), so make sure you get there on time.</p>

It’s Phish, so it probably goes without saying that at least one or two surprises are in store.</p>
      <p><a href="https://publictheater.org/productions/joes-pub/2019/r/reverend-billy--the-church-of-stop-shopping-earth-riot/"><b>Reverend Billy &amp; The Church of Stop Shopping: Earth Riot @ Joe’s Pub</b></a><br/>Anti-consumerism activist Reverend Billy preaches his music-filled gospel with his annual holiday show residency at Joe’s Pub.</p>
