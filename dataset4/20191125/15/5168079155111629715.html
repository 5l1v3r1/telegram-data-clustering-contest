      <p><b>Muscat:</b> Marking World Children’s Day, celebrated annually on November 20th, as well as the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), Oman Post and in collaboration with the Children First Association, launched a commemorative stamp in this occasion. Held under the patronage of the Association’s Head, Her Highness Sayyida Dr. Muna bint Fahd Al Said at the Royal Opera House, the launch event of the stamp was part of a week-long programme of activities that advocated for the inalienable rights of children.<br/><br/>Her Highness Sayyida Dr. Muna bint Fahd Al Said, Head of the Children First Organization said, “We are working closely with UNICEF Oman, local communities across the Sultanate, public and private sector partners to ensure every Omani child realises their full potential. Our collaboration with Oman Post to launch the World Children’s Day stamp transcends commemoration and is meant to raise awareness over the Convention on the Rights of the Child and achieve real and impactful change for children.”<br/><br/>Also joining the event was Oman Post’s Chief Executive Officer, Abdulmalik Albalushi among other public and private sector representatives. The new stamp features a drawing by an Omani child, who won a competition for drawings that depicts the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the CRC, highlighting the importance of this cause and showcasing Oman’s historical role as one of the most active countries in campaigning to improve the living conditions of children around the world. Albalushi commented, “The Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most widely accepted human rights treaty in history and Oman has been a leading supporter ensuring children’s rights are met whether in government or civil society. This cause has been an inspiration for us to join hands with the Children First Association and support their efforts through the launch of this exclusive commemorative stamp. We are honoured to leverage Oman Post’s reach locally and globally to spread this message of hope and well-being for the leaders of tomorrow.”<br/><br/>The launch of the stamp was part of a week-long programme of activities led by UNICEF Oman. Major landmarks were lit up in UNICEF’s signature blue colour, including the Royal Opera House Muscat, the Children’s Library, Muscat International Airport, Salalah International Airport, Duqm International Airport, Bahla Fort, Mutrah Fort and Burj Al Sahwa. Oman Post boasts a comprehensive list of stamps, that celebrate the Sultanate’s rich history and heritage, while also shed light on key local and international occasions and their impact on society at large.</p>
