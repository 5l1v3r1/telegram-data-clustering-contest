        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 25 – Defending champions KCB and last season’s losing finalists Kabras Sugar remained unbeaten at the close of Match Day Five in the 2019 season of the Kenya Cup over the weekend.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kabras remained top of the standings after posting a 57-3 home victory over Kenyatta University’s Blak Blad, a victory that saw them register five consecutive bonus point victories for a cumulative tally of 25 points.</p>
      <p>They are tied with the bankers who are pushed second due to goal difference, Kabras boasting of a 112 aggregate over the defending champions who were made to sweat before narrowly beating Homeboyz 27-24.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Kenya Harlequinpicked up their first win of the season with a 25-15 home victory over Menengai Oilers, a victory that lifted them off the league’s basement to ninth position with 6 points, same as tenth placed Nondies but with a superior goal difference.</p>
      <p>Impala Saracens were the beneficiaries of Homeboyz’s first defeat this season, climbing to third on the log with 20 points after beating Kisumu 41-5 at the Mamboleo Showground in Kisumu.</p>
      <p>The deejays slipped one place down to fourth after their Ruaraka heartbreak while Stanbic Mwamba ‘s 27-17 win over Nondescripts at the Railway Club saw them consolidate fifth place.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, a third successive loss sees Oilers placed sixth on the log on 11 points, just one ahead of their cross-town rivals Nakuru whose second win on the bounce, a 23-10 victory over Western Bulls lifted them up to seventh on the log.</p>
      <p>Blak Blad are currently placed eighth with 7 points while promoted sides Western Bulls and Kisumu occupy eleventh and twelfth positions on the table after succumbing to home defeats against Nakuru and Impala respectively.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile in the second tier league, Strathmore Leos and Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology (MMUST) maintained the status quo, both registering their fifth consecutive victories on the bounce to stay top of the pile after match day five.</p>
      <p>The Leos were too strong for visiting South Coast Pirates, winning this encounter at their Madaraka ground 57-0 to lead the Championship with 24 points, three clear of MMUST who beat University of Eldoret 22-3 in Kakamega.</p>
      <p>Mean Machine won their third match in succession, defeating Mombasa 40-9 at the University of Nairobi to consolidate third place on the log with 16 points, three clear of debutants Northern Suburbs who shocked the Catholic Monks 25-13.</p>
      <p>USIU Martials and Egerton Wasps played out a 14-14 stalemate in Roysambu, both sides staying in fifth and sixth positions on 12 and 11 points respectively.</p>
      <p>University of Eldoret’s slide down the table continued. The 22-3 defeat to MMUST in Kakamega saw the Trojans drop to seventh on the log on 10 points, same as their cross-town rivals Eldoret RFC who are placed eighth on the log.</p>
