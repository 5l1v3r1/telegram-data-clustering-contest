      <p>The detrimental impact of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/domestic-abuse">domestic abuse</a> on a woman’s career has been highlighted in a <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=44681X1458326&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vodafone.com%2Fperspectives%2Fblog%2Finternational-research-shows-workplace-impacts-of-domestic-abuse&amp;sref=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/domestic-violence-women-careers-time-off-absence-impact-a9216541.html">new study</a>, with many victims taking time off work following <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/violence">violence</a>.</p>
      <p>A KPMG report commissioned by Vodafone indicated that more than half a million working women in the UK have experienced domestic violence and abuse in the past year.</p>
      <p>In the UK alone, around 122,000 women are estimated to have taken time off work because of domestic abuse in the past year alone. </p>
      <p>The phone company, which published the report on the <a href="https://mediacentre.vodafone.co.uk/news/new-research-shows-how-domestic-violence-and-abuse-affects-uk-workplace/">International Day For The Elimination Of Violence Against Women</a>, estimates that over £300 million is being lost by UK businesses each year as a consequence of work absences related to domestic abuse.</p>
      <p>Data gathered from 107 countries by the United Nations (UN) and International Labour Organisation (ILO) reveals that globally 80 million working women – 15 per cent of the female workforce – have suffered domestic violence and abuse in the past 12 months. </p>
      <p>Four million women also missed out on a promotion as a result of domestic violence and abuse - suffering a related annual average salary loss of $2,900 (£2,251) per woman.</p>
      <p>This equates to approximately $13 billion (£10 billion) in total potential earnings lost each year.</p>
      <p>Of these women, more than a third reported reduced productivity, while a fifth said they sometimes stopped going to work or would take days off.</p>
      <p>Helen Lamprell, of the Vodafone UK Foundation said: “Domestic abuse has such a huge effect on the individual, their family and friends and a vast financial impact to both the individual and the UK economy.”</p>
      <p>The mobile phone giant introduced a policy for victims of domestic violence in 25 of its operating companies, with employees gaining access to support, specialist counselling and up to 10 days paid leave in all countries. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Nicki Norman, acting co-chief executive of Women’s Aid, told <i>The Independent</i>: “Domestic abuse has a harrowing impact on women’s lives and this inevitably affects their careers.</p>
      <p>"While the human cost of domestic abuse is immeasurable, the cost to business is estimated at nearly £2 billion a year.</p>
      <p>"At Women’s Aid, we are encouraging all employers to provide training for staff on the nature and impact of domestic abuse, and for this to be mandatory for managers and HR leads.</p>
      <p>"Furthermore, in the new Parliament, we will be pushing for legislation to include paid domestic abuse leave, to ensure survivors are supported at work and also to send a clear message that domestic abuse is everyone’s business.” </p>
