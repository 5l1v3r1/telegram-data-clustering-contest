      <h1>Former Iowa Star George Kittle Has A Message For Nebraska</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:51:07+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Former Iowa star George Kittle appeared on <i>SportsCenter </i>following the San Francisco 49ers’ dominant Sunday night win over the Green Bay Packers. The star tight end and Scott Van Pelt discussed his team’s big victory. Then, college football came up.</p>
      <p>It’s rivalry week for Iowa, which is set to take on Nebraska at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln.</p>
      <p>Kittle, who went 3-1 against the Huskers, did not hold back with his comments about the rivalry.</p>
      <p>“You know, I’m pretty sure if we win this one it’ll be five straight, and I think Chad Greenway said something about taking over the state of Nebraska. But honestly, I don’t even want the state of Nebraska,” Kittle said. “We’re just going to go in there and win that game and get five in a row and just let it be. That’s all I have to say about it.”</p>
      <p>He then added: “I’m looking forward to Iowa going in there and whooping them.”</p>

      <p>Iowa has dominated the rivalry as of late, winning five of the last six games. This will be a big one for the Huskers, though, as Scott Frost’s team is looking to become bowl eligible.</p>
      <p>Nebraska and Iowa are set to kick off at 2:30 p.m. E.T. on Friday.</p>
      <p>The game will be on BTN.</p>
