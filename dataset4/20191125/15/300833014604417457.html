      <h3>How to fix iPhone 11 performance issues</h3>
      <h4>Solution 1: Restart your iPhone</h4>
      <p>This is the best place to start. With time, your phone may become sluggish, so the quickest way to improve its performance is by restarting it. This will close all the apps and give the phone a quick refreshment. It is much easier than closing apps one by one. Firs press the volume up button, then press volume done. Finally, press the Side button. A slider will appear. Drag it to turn your phone down. To turn it back on, press and hold the Side button for a couple of seconds.</p>
      <h4>Solution 2: Disable Background app refresh</h4>
      <p>This simple step will not only boost the phone’s performance. You will also notice the battery lasts longer. This feature allows all of the apps to refresh their content when the Wi-Fi on your phone is turned on. To disable it, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Background app refresh. Turn it off by toggling the switch next to the Background app refresh.</p>
      <h4>Solution 3: Free up the storage space</h4>
      <p>When you have a powerful phone, you tend to store hundreds of photos, videos, files of all kinds, etc. But, no matter how powerful the phone is, you always need to leave some storage space on it. If you have a lot of files, perhaps it is the time to clear it all up a bit. You may back up or delete unnecessary files, apps included.</p>
      <h4>Solution 4: Remove the apps you don’t use and update the rest</h4>
      <p>It is a good idea to get rid of the apps you don’t use. They may slow down your phone (by running in the background), and they will also affect the storage space. So, go to the Home screen, find the app you wish to remove. Tap on its icon and hold it a for a couple of seconds, until it jiggles. An X will show up. Tap on it and delete the app.</p>
      <p>Once you clear up the apps, go to App Store and update all the remaining ones. That way, you’ll make sure that you have the last version of the apps you are regularly using. Developers keep improving the apps and their performance, that’s why the updates are important.</p>
      <h4>Solution 5: Update the software</h4>
      <p>Make sure you have the latest version of iOS. If there is a new one, get it. Connect to a Wi-Fi network. Go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software update. Tap Download and install.</p>
      <h4>Solution 6: Erase all content and settings</h4>
      <p>Resetting the phone to its factory defaults will give you a feel like you have a brand new device. But, before you start back up all of your files. Once done:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset</li>
        <li>Tap Erase all content and settings</li>
        <li>Enter the passcode</li>
        <li>Tap Erase iPhone.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This may take a while. When the process is completed, follow the on-screen instructions to set up your iPhone 11 as a new device.</p>
