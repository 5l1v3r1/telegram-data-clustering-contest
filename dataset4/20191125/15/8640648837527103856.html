      <h1>RTC to get $7.5M federal grant for camera upgrades, bus wash system</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:38:56+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/staff/marvin-clemons/" target="_blank">Marvin Clemons</a></address>
      <p>The federal government is awarding a nearly $7.5 million grant to allow the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada to replace and update security cameras and software on its fixed-route and paratransit fleet in addition to improving its bus washing system.</p>
      <p>The RTC said in a release the U.S. Department of Transportation grant awarding process will be completed in three to six months,.</p>
      <p>The RTC will upgrade cameras and software for 811 vehicles in its fleet. In addition, a new wash facility for its paratransit vehicles will be built and the existing wash facility will be rehabilitated, as it is 10 years old and is the only such facility for all buses and paratransit units. Both projects will take up to two years to complete.</p>
      <p>“I am excited to be selected,” said MJ Maynard, CEO of the RTC. “It’s an incredibly competitive national process and this funding is needed.”</p>
      <p>Maynard said that the new wash facility for the shorter 26-foot paratransit units will free up the bus washing facility, which is designed for 40- and-60-foot vehicles. Rehabilitating it now is critical, she said, because “it is at the end of its life cycle.”</p>
      <p>Local sales tax of $4 million will also be used, bringing the total funding to $11.5 million.</p>
