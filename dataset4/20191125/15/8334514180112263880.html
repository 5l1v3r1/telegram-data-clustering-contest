      <p>PARIS (Reuters) - Software company Capgemini will stick to its bid of 14 euros ($15.43) per share for smaller rival Altran, its chief executive told Reuters, as it tries to fend off pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott for a higher offer.</p>

      <p>Elliott, which made waves in France last year when it revealed a stake in drinks maker Pernod Ricard, has since built a holding of more than 10% in Altran, regulatory filings show.</p>
      <p>It has also said Capgemini’s 3.6 billion-euro bid from June this year undervalued Altran.</p>
      <p>Capgemini CEO Paul Hermelin said in an interview that he believed the IT services and consultancy group would manage to get 50.1% of Altran shareholders behind the deal at the current offer price, which would not be altered.</p>
      <p>“It will not change,” he said, adding that Capgemini thought it was a fair value after having had access to Altran’s books. “We saw things we liked and others we liked less.”</p>
      <p>Capgemini is hoping the deal will add to its services in industries from telecoms to aerospace, and bring large cost savings. Its offer represented a 22% premium to Altan’s share price on the day it was announced.</p>
      <p>The company has outlined a self-imposed threshold to get backing from just over half of Altran’s investors. Below this point, Capgemini will let the deal go and study other acquisition targets, Hermelin said.</p>
      <p>“At that stage we’d walk away and do something else,” Hermelin said. “I have lots of other ideas. The digital industry is full of opportunities.”</p>
      <p>Hermelin said he was prepared to meet Elliott representatives to discuss the Altran deal, if they had something new to discuss.</p>
      <p>Elliott declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Capgemini’s Altran takeover also faces other hurdles, such as a legal challenge filed in Paris by representatives of Altran’s minority shareholders, including Elliott, taking issue with some of the formalities around the deal.</p>
      <p>A court hearing is scheduled for Dec. 4 to examine that claim, which could lead Capgemini’s offer to be suspended for at least five months for a longer review.</p>
      <p>“We’ll see then what we do,” Hermelin said.</p>
