      <p>America will be traveling in big numbers this Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>It’s estimated to be the busiest Thanksgiving travel period since 2005, with more than 55 million Americans making a trip longer than 50 miles, according to the AAA. That’s 1.6 million more than last year, a nearly 2.9 percent increase.</p>
      <p>Nearly 32 million of those are expected to fly, <a href="https://www.airlines.org/news/airlines-for-america-projects-record-31-6-million-passengers-over-thanksgiving-travel-period/">according</a> to Airlines for America (A4A), an industry trade group, a 3.7 percent jump from 2018.</p>
      <p>American Airlines alone said it expects to operate 74,396 flights and fly more than 7.4 million passengers during the 12 day period between November 22 and December 3.</p>
      <p>Delta expects to carry 3.2 million passengers between Monday, November 25 and Sunday, December 1.</p>
      <p>To accommodate the extra traffic, US airlines are adding an average of 859 flights per day, according to A4A, averaging 108,000 seats added per day.</p>
      <p>During the travel period, the busiest days are expected to be Sunday, December 1 – with 3.1 million passengers expected, a new single-day record – followed by Wednesday, November 27 – 2.98 million passengers – and Friday, November 22 – 2.96 million.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, the lightest day for air travel is expected to be Thanksgiving Day, with 1.79 million passengers.</p>
      <p>As a result, airports around the country are going to be packed to the gills – even more than usual. Last year, five of the 20 busiest airports in the world were located in the US. This included the busiest airport in the world, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International which hosted more than 107 million passengers.</p>
      <p>Los Angeles International or LAX was the second-busiest airport in the US and the fourth busiest in the world – up from being the fifth busiest the previous year – with just over 87.5 million travelers. Chicago’s O’Hare International came in third place in the US and sixth place worldwide with more than 83.2 million passengers annually.</p>
      <p>To give you a better idea of which US airport will likely be the most crowded, here’s a breakdown of the 10 busiest airports in the US based on passenger numbers.</p>
