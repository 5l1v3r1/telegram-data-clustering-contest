      <h1>8-year-old, denied school picture over cool hairstyle, becomes star of own photoshoot</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:50:22+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/rob_beschizza" target="_blank">Rob Beschizza</a></address>
      <p>An 8-year-old girl was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/us/girl-denied-school-picture-hair-trnd/index.html">denied a school photo because her principal singled her out for hairstyle policy enforcement</a>. The unjust treatment, with its racial edge—a middle-aged white man policing a young black girl's hair—could have led nowhere happy. But Chicago-area photographer <a href="https://www.jermainehorton.com/">Jermaine Horton</a> got in touch with her parents, then arranged a photo shoot that put made sure Marion Scott stayed the star of her own story.

      <blockquote>"This is an 8-year-old girl who was singled out by her school," Horton said to CNN. "I'm a father and I'm tired of seeing injustices like this happen. I wanted to go out there and help build this girl's confidence."<br/><br/>Earlier this month, Horton drove 4 1/2 hours to Michigan just to make it happen. His one request? Marian should wear her red, braided extensions for the shoot.<br/><br/>"I wanted her to be herself and to let her know that it's OK to be herself," said Horton.<br/>And Marian did just that.</blockquote>
