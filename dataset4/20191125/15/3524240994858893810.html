      <p>Abdulrasheed Maina, former Chairman, defunct Pension Reform Task Team, on Monday, arrived at the Federal High Court, Abuja, with the aid of a walking stick.</p>
      <p>Maina, who came into Court 6, 2nd Floor of the building, at 9:40 am supported himself with a walking stick.</p>
      <p>The ex-pension reform boss, who is standing trial on alleged money laundering charge to the tune of over N2 billion preferred against him by the EFCC, was dressed in a brown caftan with a matching cap.</p>
      <p>The <i>News Agency of Nigeria</i>, reports that Justice Abang, on November 21, fixed Monday for hearing on the bail application and for the continuation of his trial.</p>
      <p>The judge, who accused the Nigerian Correctional Services of compounding the issue before the court for failure to produce a medical report on the health status of Maina days after the order to the effect was made by the court, ruled that Maina’s trial would be on a day-to-day basis in subsequent proceedings.</p>
      <p><i>NAN</i> reports that the trial of Maina was stalled in the last adjourned date due to his worsening health condition.</p>
      <p>The EFCC had on October 25, arraigned Maina alongside his firm, Common Input Property and Investment Ltd, before Justice Abang.</p>
      <p>Though he pleaded not guilty to the 12-count charge, his trial has yet to make meaningful progress due to his failing health.</p>
      <p>The court is yet to hear Maina’s bail application fixed for today.</p>
