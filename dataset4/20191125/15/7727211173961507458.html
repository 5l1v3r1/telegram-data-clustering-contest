      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:51:25+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/luke-traynor/" target="_blank">Luke Traynor</a></address>
      <p>This is the gun and ammunition that were recovered in a lake in Wirral.</p>
      <p>A member of the public found <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/arrowe-park-hospital">ammunition in Arrowe Brook,</a> near the hospital, at around 2.35pm on November 19.</p>
      <p>The alert led to the North West Underwater Search Unit being deployed <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wirral">who scoured the area</a> and discovered a pistol.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/gun-crime">The gun, ammunition and a magazine</a> were taken for forensic examination to establish if there are any links to any offenders or incidents.</p>
      <p>Inspector Chris Lucan-Pratt, of Merseyside Police, said: "Offenders who carry and store weapons often go to great lengths to try to conceal firearms and knives, or dispose of them in an attempt to evade justice.</p>
      <p>“But Merseyside Police conducts regular warrants and searches of land targeting those places and individuals involved in the storing of firearms, and regularly takes them out of circulation.</p>

      <p>“Information from the public who have found weapons or believe they know where they may be stored is also absolutely vital part of those efforts to take them out of the hands of criminals.</p>
      <p>“Every single time a weapon is taken out of circulation it is good news for the people of Merseyside.</p>
      <p>"They are used by criminals to cause serious harm, so when members of the public come to us with information about where they may be stored they are doing their communities a great service and we will always act.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information on where firearms are being stored is asked to contact Merseyside Police via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police CC, on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via their online form at: https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information.</p>
