        <b>England bowler Jofra Archer will receive an apology from New Zealand Cricket after he was subjected to racial abuse by a spectator while batting in the first Test.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Archer, who scored a second-innings 30 as England were well beaten at Mount Maunganui, attributed the alleged abuse to "one guy" in the crowd at Bay Oval, <a href="https://www.skysports.com/live-scores/cricket/new-zealand-v-england/33811/11869701/report">where New Zealand won by an innings and 65 runs</a>.</p>
      <p>"A bit disturbing hearing racial insults today whilst battling to help save my team," Archer, 24, said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"The crowd has been amazing this week except for that one guy, the Barmy Army was good as usual also."</p>
      <p>The abuse occurred as Archer left the field of play, according to New Zealand Cricket, which said it will be examining CCTV footage to identify the man responsible and refer them to the police.</p>
      <p>New Zealand's governing body of cricket said it has "zero tolerance" towards abusive language and promised "increased vigilance" when the teams next meet in Hamilton.</p>

      <p>The England and Wales Cricket Board is investigating the incident, and said in a statement: "NZC and ECB ensure that clear guidelines are in place at every venue so that watching a cricket match is safe and enjoyable for everyone.</p>
      <p>"Whilst this is a relatively isolated incident there is absolutely no place for anti-social or racist behaviour within the game and it is vitally important that all spectators feel able to come forward to report such behaviour and feel safe in doing so."</p>
      <p>Barbados-born Archer was fast-tracked into the England side after representing West Indies at U19 level, and made an impressive Test debut during the Ashes series against Australia.</p>
      <p>An England supporter reported that a group of men were singing a racist song about Archer during the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford in September.</p>
      <p>Hosts New Zealand now take a 1-0 lead into the second Test of the two-match series.</p>
