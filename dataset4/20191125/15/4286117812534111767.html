      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Shiv Sena, NCP, Congress MLAs took a "pledge" to back the post-poll alliance of the three parties</li>
        <li>This comes after BJP's Devendra Fadnavis took oath as Maharashtra CM on Saturday morning</li>
        <li>On Tuesday, the SC is expected to rule when and whether a floor test will be carried out in Maharashtra</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The ballroom of a five-star in Mumbai played host to a grand show of strength Monday night as the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress party attempted to prove that their flock of MLAs was together in Maharashtra. In a room dotted with 'We Are 162' posters and against the literal backdrop of a giant cut-out of the Constitution of India, MLAs from these parties took a "pledge" to stay together and back the post-poll alliance of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress.</p>
      <p>This just a day before the Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether the Maharashtra assembly will witness an urgent floor test to check who stands where in terms of support enjoyed in the House. At the show of strength, orchestrated at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Mumbai, top Sena, NCP and Congress leaders expressed confidence of emerging victorious in the eventual floor test.</p>
      <p>This comes after a weekend of stunning developments that began with the Bharatiya Janata Party's Devendra Fadnavis taking oath as chief minister along with the NCP's Ajit Pawar. Ajit Pawar's siding with the BJP sent shockwaves across Maharashtra's political circles. The man, after all, is the nephew of NCP chief Sharad Pawar.</p>
      <p>Sharad Pawar, however, was quick to distance himself from his nephew's move. As things stand, the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress combine seem to have the upper hand with Ajit Pawar increasingly looking isolated.</p>
      <p>However, the Maharashtra chapter is far from over -- all eyes will now be on the Supreme Court, which on Tuesday will rule when and whether a floor test will be carried out in Maharashtra in order for BJP's Fadnavis to prove that he enjoys majority support in the House.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The day began with the Supreme Court continuing its hearing from Sunday on pleas filed by the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress seeking an urgent floor test in Maharashtra. The court heard arguments from the parties, from Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar, from the Governor of Maharashtra and from the Centre in an expansive 80-minute hearing.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court then adjourned the matter <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/maharashtra-politcal-crisis-sc-to-pronounce-order-on-ncp-cong-sena-plea-at-10-30-am-tomorrow-1622351-2019-11-25">until 10:30 am Tuesday when, it said, it will pass orders</a> on the pleas seeking an urgent floor test in Maharashtra. Going by the court's own past judgment, it is widely expected that the Supreme Court will order an <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/news-analysis/story/what-if-ncp-mlas-boycott-fadnavis-floor-test-and-other-possibilities-1622366-2019-11-25">immediate floor test in Maharashtra</a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Devendra Fadnavis got to work as chief minister, announcing relief for farmers and chairing a meeting with the state's bureaucrats.</p>
      <p>
        <b>THE GRAND MLA PARADE</b>
      </p>
      <p>On Monday, the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress gathered its MLAs at the posh Grand Hyatt Hotel in Mumbai's Bandra Kurla Complex. Top leaders from the parties -- including Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and NCP boss Sharad Pawar -- were seen visibly confident.</p>
      <p>Address the gathering, Uddhav Thackeray even quipped that such were the numbers of the alliance that a photographer would need a wide-angle lens to capture the scene at the Grand Hyatt.</p>

      <p>Later, NCP chief Sharad Pawar spoke to the MLAs and crucially pointed out that Ajit Pawar has been sacked as the legislative party leader of the NCP and so would not be able to issue a 'whip' to the party's MLAs during the upcoming floor test. (Defying a party whip could see an MLA end up losing his seat.)</p>
      <p>At the end of the massive gathering, all the MLAs -- who number 162 in total as claimed by the parties -- took a "pledge" to stay with the Sena-NCP-Congress alliance and not to support the BJP or fall for any inducement.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WEEKEND OF SURPRISES</b>
      </p>
      <p>All these developments come after a stunning weekend that turned everything on its head in Maharashtra politics. On Saturday morning, <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/devendra-fadnavis-maharashtra-cm-again-1621847-2019-11-23">Devendra Fadnavis returned as Maharashtra's CM taking oath at a surprise ceremony</a> that also had NCP's Ajit Pawar take oath as his deputy.</p>
      <p>What was particularly stunning about the Saturday morning development was the fact that it happened just hours after the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress firmed up their alliance and announced that they would form government under the leadership of Uddhav Thackeray.</p>
      <p>By Saturday morning, the tables turned. Sharad Pawar and the larger NCP rushed to distance themselves from Ajit Pawar's move, saying it had been done against party wishes.</p>
      <p>The rest of the weekend was spent by the parties getting their MLAs together and approaching the Supreme Court seeking an urgent floor test in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Right now, both the sides have expressed confidence of being able to show majority in the Maharashtra assembly. How this political game will end is anybody's guess.</p>
