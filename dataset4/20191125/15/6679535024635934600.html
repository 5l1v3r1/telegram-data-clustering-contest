      <p>People of Narasampet constituency hailed the decision of the State government to upgrade the local area hospital to 250-bed hospital, which was their long-pending demand.</p>
      <p>The people of the constituency thanked MLA Peddi Sudharshan Reddy for his efforts.</p>
      <p>Mr. Reddy on his part thanked the government for sanctioning ₹ 60 crore for the development of the hospital which would be converted into a district hospital for the benefit of the people of Narsampet and surrounding mandals in Warangal rural district, which are predominantly tribal areas.</p>
      <p>“Following my efforts, a dialysis centre was already set up at the hospital for the benefit of kidney patients. Besides this, a blood bank was also set up at the area hospital recently,” he said, and added that the 250-bed hospital would come up on five acres of land on the outskirts of the city with all modern facilities and equipment.</p>
      <p>The development of Narsampet hospital will reduce the burden on the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital, Warangal, he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, TRS town president Naini Narsaiah and party mandal president Namala Satyanarayana, Lekkala Vidyasagar Reddy along with party workers and people offered <i>palabhisekham </i>to the portrait of Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao and MLA Peddi Sudharshan Reddy in Narsampet on Monday.</p>
      <p>They also celebrated the occasion by distributing sweets. In Chennaraopet mandal too, TRS leaders, including party mandal president Balne Venkanna, mandal parishad vice-chairman Kandi Krishna Reddy and others burst crackers and distributed sweets.</p>
