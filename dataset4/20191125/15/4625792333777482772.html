      <p>President Trump wants his son-in-law Jared Kushner to check in with Matt Drudge, the publisher of the Drudge Report, about him pushing anti-Trump content.</p>
      <p>"What’s going on with Drudge?" the president has been asking allies <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-privately-frets-whats-going-on-with-drudge-during-impeachment-asks-jared-kusher-to-look-into-it">according</a> to a report by the Daily Beast on Saturday. Trump has singled out Kushner to "look into it" and talk to Drudge about why he is highlighting anti-Trump content on his typically conservative news aggregation site.</p>
      <p>The request follows House Democrats' continued impeachment push, and Trump's attempts to cluster media allies to defend himself. The president has not yet lashed out at Drudge publicly, but he has not been shy about going after Fox News staff that fail to tow the party line.</p>
      <p>The president's reluctance to go after Drudge could be that his site holds the influence to set media narratives in both conservative circles and the broader media landscape. People who have spoken to Trump also said he generally has respect for how Drudge operates his company.</p>
