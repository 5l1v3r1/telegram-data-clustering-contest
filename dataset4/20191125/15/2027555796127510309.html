      <h1>England's Archer says he was subjected to racial abuse</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:52:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/reuters" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>The England and New Zealand cricket boards launched a probe on Monday after England fast bowler Jofra Archer said he was subjected to racial insults by a spectator while batting during the final day of the opening test at Bay Oval.</p>
      <p>New Zealand cruised to an innings and 65-run win over England to take a 1-0 lead in the two-match series.</p>
      <p>Archer scored 30 and combined in a 59-run partnership for the ninth wicket with Sam Curran to delay the hosts' victory.</p>
      <p>"A bit disturbing hearing racial insults today whilst battling to help save my team, the crowd has been amazing this week except for that one guy," the 24-year-old said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Archer, who was born in Barbados and represented West Indies at Under-19 level, has been fast-tracked into the England side and made an impressive test debut during the Ashes series against Australia.</p>
      <p>According to the protocol, the International Cricket Council-appointed match referee Javagal Srinath of India is expected to mention the incident in his match report to the world governing body.</p>
      <p>The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said the incident took place after Archer was dismissed and was walking off the field to the pavilion.</p>
      <p>"Through the scrutiny of CCTV footage at the Bay Oval, authorities are trying to identify the individual or individuals responsible for the remarks," the ECB said in a statement. "The investigation is ongoing."</p>
      <p>New Zealand Cricket said the security providers at the venue were unable to locate the perpetrator and the board will apologize to Archer.</p>
      <p>"NZC has zero-tolerance towards abusive or offensive language at any of its venues and will refer any developments in the case to the police," the NZC added.</p>
      <p>"It will contact Mr. Archer tomorrow to apologize for the unacceptable experience, and to promise increased vigilance in the matter when the teams next meet in Hamilton."</p>
      <p>The second test starts in Hamilton on Friday.</p>
