      <h1>The Newcastle United team fans want to see at Aston Villa tonight</h1>
      <h2>The Magpies take on Aston Villa in front of the TV cameras in their first game since the international break</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:37:32+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:37</time> by <a rel="author">Stuart Jamieson</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle United fans would put Florian Lejeune straight back into the Premier League fray at Aston Villa tonight.</p>
      <p>The Magpies travel to Villa Park for their first match since the back-to-back wins over West Ham and Bournemouth before the international break.</p>
      <p>While manager <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a> will be keen to maintain his side's good run, he will have to make a few changes to the XI which started the 2-1 win over Eddie Howe's Cherries last time out.</p>
      <p>With Jamaal Lascelles and Ciaran Clark ruled out through injury, Bruce must decide between Federico Fernandez, Paul Dummett, fit-again Fabian Schar and Lejeune, who is back in contention after a cruciate ligament injury kept him out since last April.</p>
      <p>And United fans have gone for the Frenchman, alongside <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/fabian-schar">Schar</a> and Fernandez, for the Villa Park test tonight.</p>
      <p>It's a case of more of the same in midfield and up front, with the pace of Miguel Almiron and Allan Saint-Maximin hopefully having the same impact as it did at West Ham</p>
