      <p>Taylor Swift let her outfit speak for itself during the opening of her performance at the American Music Awards on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Swift received the artist of the decade award at the Los Angeles, California, event, and preceded her acceptance speech with a medley of her biggest hits. She first performed “The Man,” off her 2019 album “Lover,” which <a href="https://www.insider.com/amas-taylor-swift-performance-video-began-with-man-song-2019-11">includes lyrics about double standards and sexism against women</a>.</p>
      <p>While performing the song, Swift donned a white button-up shirt emblazoned with the names of her previous six albums: “Taylor Swift,” “Fearless,” “Speak Now,” “Red,” “1989,” and “Reputation.”</p>

      <p>The font used for each album name is similar to that typically used on prison uniforms. Swift was likely using her shirt as a metaphor for her ongoing feud with <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/big-machine-records">Big Machine Records</a>, her former label that <a href="https://www.insider.com/taylor-swift-big-machine-masters-scooter-braun-2019-7">owns the master recordings of nearly her entire catalog</a>.</p>
      <p>Swift previously released a statement saying she was unsure if she’d be able to perform a medley of her hits at the 2019 American Music Awards, claiming that her former label was preventing her from doing so. Though the two parties <a href="https://www.insider.com/taylor-swift-will-perform-amas-label-agreement-2019-11">publicly disagreed on the matter</a>, Swift ended up singing lines from six of her songs.</p>
      <p>“Lover,” which Swift owns the masters of, was not featured on the shirt.</p>

      <p>Swift wasn’t the only one to wear the prison-like shirt. A group of children also joined the musician on stage wearing matching ensembles.</p>
      <p>Many fans believe Swift was implying that future generations should be able to own the work they create.</p>

      <p>Though she later changed into a sparkling leotard and pink cape, Swift’s initial sentiment was echoed throughout her performance. For example, she moved to a gold piano covered in the names of her albums at the end of her performance.</p>

      <p>Earlier in the night, Swift walked the AMAs red carpet in a sleeveless green dress covered in sparkles. Her gown was custom-made by Julien Macdonald, and featured a thigh-high slit that revealed her tall black boots.</p>
      <p>Her shoes were designed by Casadei, and <a href="https://www.casadei.com/en/shoes/high-boots/blade-black-1T000D125HHNAGU9000.html">retail for $1,565</a>.</p>
