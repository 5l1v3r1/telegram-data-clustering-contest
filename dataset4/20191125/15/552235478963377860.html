      <h1>Caring Paisley cancer support group honoured with community champion accolade</h1>
      <h2>Rays of Hope took home a ROCCO Award and smashed £20,000 through two fundraising drives.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:53:28+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:53</time> by <a rel="author">Andrea Lambrou, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/andrea-lambrou/</a></address>
      <p>A vital cancer support group has more than one reason to celebrate after raising more than £20,000 and scooping a top award.</p>
      <p>Rays of Hope is now an award-winning voluntary group following its Community Champion Award win at the Renfrewshire Chamber of Commerce’s ROCCO Awards.</p>
      <p>The Elderslie group “raised the roof” at a glittering ceremony in Renfrew’s Normandy Hotel last week when they accepted the prestigious accolade for offering help to up to 140 cancer-stricken locals and their loved ones from the point of diagnosis.</p>
      <p>Based in Byres Road, Rays of Hope is the only group of its kind in Renfrewshire, saving local cancer patients and their families from having to travel further afield for vital help and guidance.</p>

      <p>Founder Linda O’Malley said: “We were absolutely over the moon. All ten of us went on stage to collect the award and were so excited we raised the roof.</p>
      <p>“The award is taking pride of place on our tea counter surrounded by lots of congratulation cards from our members.”</p>

      <p>The celebrations continued when 300 fundraisers turned out for Rays of Hope’s second annual ladies lunch and raised £17,000.</p>
      <p>Members and their families and friends were joined by nursing staff from Paisley’s Royal Alexandra Hospital and Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, and the RAH’s cancer surgeon Susan Moug for the event in the Glynhill Hotel.</p>
      <p>Guests were piped into the reception by St Columba’s School Pipe Band before being entertained with their hilarious ‘boobs and bums’ game, a raffle and an auction compered by group ambassador Tony Fitzpatrick and Edith Forrest, followed by a disco with DJ Colin Bell.</p>

      <p>The ladies also got some Christmas shopping in with a whole host of festive goodies on offer from stallholders selling fashion, jewellery, candles and chocolates.</p>
      <p>Volunteers from Santander and West College Scotland were also on hand to take care of the photography on the day and a fun photobooth raised more than a few laughs.</p>
      <p>Linda added: “We are absolutely delighted to have raised such a fantasic amount this year thanks to these amazing ladies, who come from all walks of life.”</p>
      <p>The funding will go towards buying and delivering Boxes of Hope to newly-diagnosed breast cancer patients undergoing treatment at Paisley’s Royal Alexandra Hospital.</p>
      <p>As well as a personalised message and card from a member of the group, each Box of Hope contains unperfumed toiletries, earphones, bed socks, mindfulness books, colouring books and pencils, puzzles, reusable water bottles, tissues and eye gel.</p>
      <p>“This was all to help fund our fabulous Boxes of Hope for people with breast and bowel cancer. These cost £40 each”, said Linda.</p>
      <p>“We take three of each to the RAH every day for people who have been diagnosed.”</p>

      <p>Another £4,000 is expected to be added to the fundraising pot from the group’s inaugural sponsored walk.</p>
      <p>The Rainbow Memory Walk was conceived by the group following the recent death of members Fiona Turnbull and Janice Lynn.</p>
      <p>It saw 35 members walk across 11 Glasgow bridges – from Bell’s Bridge to Glasgow Green – in memory of lives lost to cancer.</p>
      <p>Linda said: “We lost two of our ladies this year so this is in memory of them and all of our members who have passed away in the four years since we started. It was a happy event, not a solumn one, as Fiona and Janice were such fun people. It is will be a nice tradition to have to support one another and remember the happy times.”</p>
      <p>Funds will also be put towards a new extension and car park to support Rays of Hope’s growing membership.</p>
