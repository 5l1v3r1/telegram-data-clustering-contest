      <h1>Gender Politics, Climate Change Dominate at American Music Awards</h1>
      <h2>Political and cultural topics – from gender politics to climate change – dominated the 2019 American Music Awards performances on Sunday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:47:06+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:47</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Bleau</a></address>
      <p>Activist artists did more than promote their political agendas in grandiose speeches, as is usually custom, during Sunday night’s AMAs at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, as Newsbusters <a href="https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/culture/karen-townsend/2019/11/24/bad-optics-american-music-awards-messages-costumes-scenery">notes</a>. Many opted to advance their causes in more subtle ways – through set design, costumes, and lyrics.</p>
      <p><b>Kesha performed “Raising Hell” alongside reality TV star Big Freedia, a gay man who is “</b><b>gender-nonconforming.”</b> The “TiK ToK” singer opened the performance by telling the audience, “Welcome to <i>our</i> Sunday Service” – a direct reference to Kanye West’s gospel-filled church services, which have <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kanye-west-louisiana-sunday-service-jesus-lord">resulted</a> in thousands of people accepting Jesus as their Lord and Savior. A rainbow church set served as a backdrop for the performance.</p>

        <b>Taylor Swift, who highlighted her newfound devotion to “social justice” in her latest album <i>Lover </i>and won six awards including Artist of the Decade, opened her performance with the song “The Man,” which laments gender double standards. </b>

      <blockquote>I’m so sick of running as fast as I can<br/>Wondering if I’d get there quicker if I was a man<br/>And I’m so sick of them coming at me again<br/>‘Cause if I was a man, then I’d be the man</blockquote>

        <b>Pop sensation Billie Eilish – the recipient of the New Artist of the Year award – performed “All the Good Girls Go to Hell” and wore a black shirt that featured the words “No Music On a Dead Planet” in red sequins and featured flames emblazoned beneath, a reference to global warming.</b>

      <p>It is hardly the first time the 17-year-old pop star has spoken out about the climate change “crisis.”</p>
      <p>“Our Earth is warming up and our oceans are rising,” Eilish said in a video in September. “Extreme weather is wrecking millions of lives.”</p>
