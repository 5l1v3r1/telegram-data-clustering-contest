      <h4>Black Friday Xbox Deals</h4>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>One of the biggest parts of the Xbox sale is the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/deals/123665/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-on-sale-for-ps1-in-early-black-friday-deal">Game Pass Ultimate</a> deal, which gives new members access for three months for only £1. This also includes the brand-new holiday offer that Xbox is offering all Ultimate members, including one month of EA Access, three months of Discord Nitro, and six months of Spotify Premium.</p>
      <p>We're expecting Xbox One S and Xbox One X consoles and bundles to receive some discounts over the next few days. The best offer at the moment is the Xbox One X and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order bundle currently priced at £309.99. But, this bundle is also slightly cheaper (£299.99) at Amazon, so we'd recommend buying there instead.</p>
