      <p>A 14 year-old foster child reportedly raped then tortured a six year-old girl to death after being left to babysit.</p>
      <p>Antonio Evans attacked Destine King and her siblings, a seven year-old girl and nine year-old boy, in Memphis, Tennessee, in December 2015.</p>
      <p>All three of his victims were also in foster care at the time.</p>
      <p>Evans, who is now 18, admitted adult charges of second-degree murder and aggravated child abuse on Friday.</p>
      <p>He was originally also charged with rape of a child under eight, although that charge was later dropped, with Evans now jailed for 30 years.</p>

      <p>Police were called to the family’s home, with Destine taken to hospital, where she died five days later.</p>
      <p>She was discovered to have suffered injuries including a lacerated liver, pelvic bruising, bite marks on her back, a shoe print on her vagina and bleeding on her brain</p>
      <p>The surviving youngsters told police that Evans had threatened to hurt them further if they told anyone what he’d been doing to them.</p>
      <p>Both suffered severe bruising on their faces and across their bodies.</p>
      <p>Evans was being fostered by Destine’s older sister at the time of the killing.</p>
      <p>Her siblings were removed from their home and placed in another foster home after being treated for their injuries.</p>
      <p>Speaking at his daughter’s funeral, Destine’s distraught dad Trevin King told the <a href="https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/2016/01/12/destine-star-king-family-mourns-girl-6-who-died-after-attack-in-cordova-home/90377568/">Commercial Appeal:</a> ‘I just miss her so much.</p>

      <p>Family friend Sherrie Lanahan added: ‘She was so full of life and we had so much fun.</p>
      <p>‘I just wanted to say how much we are going to miss her as part of the family for the short time that we got to be with her.’</p>
