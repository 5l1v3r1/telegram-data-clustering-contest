      <h1>Kanye West’s ‘Nebuchadnezzar’ opera was a loud flop</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:00:50+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Frishberg</a></address>
      <p>Kanye West is continuing to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/25/kanye-west-loses-more-fans-with-weird-jesus-is-king-movie-delayed-album/">alienate fans</a>.</p>
      <p>Attendees were disappointed by the artist’s only performance of “Nebuchadnezzar,” his first-ever opera, on Sunday. The hourlong gospel-take about the longest-reigning king of Babylon started late, had rough acoustics and didn’t sell out, the audience reports.</p>
      <p>A live stream of the opera on the platform Tidal was delayed by over an hour, with West instead playing older songs on repeat — a move <a href="https://twitter.com/mxrganfox/status/1198770945139363841">one watcher referred to</a> as “the most Kanye thing ever.”</p>
      <p>Those there in person to see the show live at Los Angeles’ Hollywood Bowl had to wait in real time: Although the show was slated to begin at 4 p.m., it didn’t start until 6:14, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/11/25/kanye-wests-opera-nebuchadnezzar-started-2-hours-late-how-it/4295085002/">USA Today writes</a>.</p>
      <p>And when it did start, it was a scream.</p>
      <p>After waiting double the performance’s length for the show to begin, West presented the opera by bellowing and moaning — to show the struggle of King Nebuchadnezzar. He then <a href="https://twitter.com/TIDAL/status/1198791684861112320">narrated the performance</a> from his <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1198792093239373829">annotated Book of Daniel</a> from the sidelines, only <a href="https://twitter.com/TIDAL/status/1198802086416310274?s=20">making an appearance on stage</a> for the final bow.</p>

      <p>Twitter critics declared the show a <a href="https://twitter.com/MissLeanaLee/status/1198879863492493317">money grab</a> and were generally horrified by the show, <a href="https://twitter.com/voxoperae/status/1198795587455459328">saying</a> even the backup vocalists’ “beautiful voices are not enough to save it.”</p>
      <p>The opera was directed by Italian performance artist Vanessa Beecroft and starred rapper Sheck Wes as the title character.</p>
      <p>Videos of the venue reveal a crowded, but not sold-out, space. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/11/25/kanye-wests-opera-nebuchadnezzar-started-2-hours-late-how-it/4295085002/">USA Today reports</a> that tickets for the opera, originally priced at $150 on Monday, had been discounted to $60 by Thursday, and the day of the performance there were still tickets available, seats then going for just $20 on Ticketmaster.</p>
      <p>West <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/kanye-announces-nebuchadnezzar-an-opera-on-the-biblical-king/">announced the opera</a> barely over a week before Sunday’s performance. News of it came the same day West <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/17/kanye-west-talks-about-serving-god-during-visit-with-joel-osteen/">declared he no longer cares for fame and money</a> but is “in the service of God,” and shortly after the release of <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/24/kanye-west-has-exhausted-fans-patience-ahead-of-jesus-is-king/">his long-belated “Jesus Is King” album</a>. And now, West says he’ll soon be <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/kanye-west-dr-dre-announce-jesus-is-king-part-ii-album/">following the album with a sequel</a>, which he’ll collaborate on with legendary producer Dr. Dre.</p>
