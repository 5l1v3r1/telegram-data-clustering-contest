      <h1>EBay selling StubHub to viagogo for $4.05 billion</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:14:14+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:14</time> by <a rel="author">The Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>EBay is selling StubHub to ticket seller viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash.</p>
      <p>The transaction is part of a review that eBay undertook earlier this year following pressure from an activist investor. The San Jose, California-based company then said it was also reviewing options for its classified ads business.</p>
      <p>EBay Inc. bought StubHub in 2007 for $310 million. Both StubHub and the classifieds business each brought in less than 10% of eBay's total revenue last year.</p>
      <p>The addition of StubHub will allow viagogo to sell tickets in more than 70 countries and give buyers access to a wider selection of tickets.</p>
      <p>Viagogo's founder and CEO Eric Baker is a StubHub co-founder. In a statement, Baker said it has been his longtime wish to unite the two companies.</p>
      <p>The sale is targeted to close by the end of 2020's first quarter.</p>

      <p>This story has been corrected to show the transaction is worth $4.05 billion, not $4.5 billion.</p>
