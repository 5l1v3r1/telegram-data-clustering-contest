      <h1>Volkswagen ID.4 Crossover Caught With Almost No Camo</h1>
      <h2>Thereâ€™s no hiding from our spy photographers.</h2>

      <p>At the<a href="https://carbuzz.com/features/what-to-look-out-for-at-the-2019-la-auto-show"> 2019 LA Auto Show</a> last week, Volkswagen introduced the newest member to the electric ID. family: the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/volkswagen-id-space-vizzion-concept-previews-a-sleek-future">ID. Space Vizzion Concept</a>, which previews a sleek electric wagon. The production model is expected to arrive in the US in late 2021. Before then, the first electric Volkswagen ID. model to go on sale in America will be the production version of the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/presenting-the-future-of-volkswagen-the-id-crozz-ii-concept">ID. Crozz</a>.</p>
      <p>We've already seen <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/here-s-your-first-look-at-the-production-volkswagen-id-crozz">prototypes of the production model</a> (which is likely to be called the ID.4), being tested, but our spy photographers have caught Volkswagen's electric crossover being tested with almost no camouflage.</p>

      <p>While we're used to seeing prototypes covered with bland black and white camo, Volkswagen has taken a less conventional approach to disguise the ID.4 prototype by making the front and rear look like a combustion-powered Opel. But the German automaker isn't fooling anyone.</p>
      <p>Compared to the concept, the production version has replaced the sliding rear doors with more conventional doors. In contrast to the concept's coupe-style sloping roofline, the production version also adopts a hatchback-style roofline to provide more space for passengers and luggage.</p>

      <p>Based on VW's electric MEB platform, the ID.4 will slot between the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/volkswagen/tiguan">Tiguan </a>and the Tiguan Allspace in terms of size but will have a longer wheelbase than the Tiguan. Being based on the same platform as the ID.4 means the ID.4 will likely be powered by two electric motors. In the Crozz concept, this setup produced a combined 302 horsepower and an electric driving range of 300 miles. The electric crossover can also charge up to 80 percent in just 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>Volkswagen has confirmed the ID.4 will debut in the US next Spring, so there's a chance it could be unveiled at the 2020 New York Auto Show in April.</p>
