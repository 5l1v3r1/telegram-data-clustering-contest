      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bbc-2/">BBC</a> Radio just announced its lineup for the festive season, which includes a three-part series exploring, well, silence in the Arctic.</p>
      <p>From Christmas Eve, listeners will be able to take a slow walk – with host Horatio Clare – from the west coast of Greenland along the Arctic Circle Trail.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/xmas19radio">BBC</a>, you’ll be able to hear everything that ‘the silence and brutal force of the elements’ has to offer.</p>
      <p>This includes the ‘beating of ravens wings, the crackle of frozen streams, the screaming winds and the sudden all-consuming silence when everything stands still.’</p>
      <p>Horatio is accompanied by three huskies, as well as ‘music that captures the light, the colours and the ever changing atmospheres of the journey.’</p>

      <p>She’ll be discussing her long and illustrious career, as well as the toll dancing took on her body.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old dancer announced she was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/21/what-happened-to-darcey-bussell-and-why-has-she-quit-strictly-come-dancing-10784050/">stepping down from Strictly Come Dancing’s judging panel</a> in April after having been with the show since 2010.</p>
      <p>She said at the time: ‘I know I will miss being part of this unique show and the fact that it celebrates dance is something I am so passionate about. I hope that I may be very lucky to be asked back again one day.’</p>
