It's definitely worth keeping an eye out for deals on this phone throughout Black Friday as we're expecting to see an additional $100 in savings here.</p>

      <p>A more affordable Pixel.</p>
      <p>Google's intention with the Pixel 3a lineup was to deliver the same great Pixel experience at a mid-range price. It's smaller size means you get less battery life, too, so that's the major trade-off for settling for the smaller phone.</p>
