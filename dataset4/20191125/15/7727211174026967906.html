      <h1>Council asks Facebook for help after getting locked out of 13 community pages</h1>
      <h2>“Bit embarrassing, we know”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:24:45+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:24</time> by <a rel="author">Kenny Lomas, Local Democracy Reporter</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/st-helens-council">St Helens Council</a> says it is working <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/facebook">with Facebook</a> to gain access to more than a dozen council-controlled pages after it was locked out two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>The council operates various Facebook pages and for the past fortnight has been unable to post any information on 13 of them after being mysteriously locked out.</p>
      <p>The pages are currently inactive and include the popular <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/st-helens">‘What’s on in St Helens’</a> page, which is followed by more than 14,000 people.</p>

      <p>Two weeks on the council said it is still working on bringing the inactive pages back into use.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately we have been experiencing problems with our family of Facebook pages after we were locked out from a range of community pages on November 9,” a council spokesman said.</p>
      <p>“We are currently working with Facebook to investigate this matter and bring them back into use.</p>
      <p>“We know that many people find these pages a great source of information and we would encourage followers to join our main <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sthelenscouncil/">St Helens Council Facebook</a> page.</p>
      <p>“This page is unaffected and is being kept up to date with the same information they rely on from our specialist service pages.”</p>
      <p>St Helens Council first informed residents of the issues through its main Facebook and Twitter accounts on November 14.</p>

      <p>“If you think we’ve gone quiet on our family of Facebook pages this week, there’s a good reason,” the post said.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been locked out of them since the weekend, and no amount of knocking has got us back in so far.</p>
      <p>“Bit embarrassing, we know.”</p>
      <p>The council provided an update the situation via social media this week, confirming it was still locked out of their own pages.</p>
      <p>Residents who want to get in touch about the council’s services have been asked to contact the authority through its main Facebook page until the problem is resolved.</p>
