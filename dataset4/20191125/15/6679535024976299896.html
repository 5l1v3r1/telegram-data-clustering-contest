      <h1>Four killed in accident at Angamaly</h1>

      <p>Four persons, including three women, were killed almost instantaneously after a private bus hit an autorickshaw in which they were travelling at Bank Junction in Angamaly along the national highway around 6.55 a.m. on Monday.</p>
      <p>The autorickshaw driver Joseph, 58, a resident of Angamaly, was also killed. Mary George, 58, of Angamaly, Mary Mathai, 65, of Angamaly, and Rosy Thomas, 50, of Mookkannur, were the other deceased.</p>
      <p>While Mary Mathai and Rosy Thomas were siblings, Mary George was their relative. All three were on their way to offer prayers at Angamaly Basilica Church when the tragedy struck.</p>
      <p>The bus, which was heading to Mookkannur from Angamaly municipal bus stand, had run into the autorickshaw.</p>
      <p>The autorickshaw had just taken the u-turn at the Bank Junction and was crossing the road when the bus, which was allegedly speeding along the left side, hit it.</p>
      <p>The autorickshaw, which was trapped under the bus, was dragged along for a distance before the bus came to a halt after running into the shops along the left side of the road.</p>
      <p>Fire and Rescue Service personnel and the police had a tough time extricating the passengers from the mangled remains of the autorickshaw. The accident caused traffic along the route to come to a grinding halt for sometime.</p>
      <p>Following the accident, people laid a siege to the road protesting lack of punitive action against speeding buses. The police eventually assured strict action following which the siege was called off.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there was public outcry to dismantle a shop located abutting the road that prevented a good view of the highway from the entry point of a feeder line.</p>
      <p>MA Gracy, chairperson of the Angamaly municipality, said that the issue had been taken up in all seriousness and the owner of the shop whoâ€™s abroad, had agreed to dismantle it at the earliest.</p>
