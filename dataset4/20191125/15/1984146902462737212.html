      <h2>Sunderland manager Phil Parkinson gives an injury update on the eve of the Black Cats' clash with the Brewers at the Stadium of Light</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">James Hunter</a></address>
      <p>Phil Parkinson has been handed a boost with defender Jordan Willis passed fit to be involved in Sunderland's game against Burton Albion tomorrow.</p>
      <p>The centre-back was substituted in the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Black Cats'</a> weekend draw against Coventry City and the initial concern was that he had aggravated the knee injury that he has been carrying.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phil-parkinson">Parkinson</a> says <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jordan-willis">Willis</a> was suffering from cramp, and he was back out on the training pitch today which means he is likely to continue his partnership with Joel Lynch when the Brewers visit the Stadium of Light.</p>
      <p>Parkinson said: "Jordan has been training today and that is a big plus for us.</p>
      <p>"He has had a knee injury and the worry was that it had flared up again, but it seems it was some slight pain in the knee and a bit of cramp, so it is not a major worry."</p>
      <p>But on-loan Reading striker <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/marc-mcnulty">Marc McNulty</a> will miss out against Burton as he continues to recover from a hamstring injury.</p>
      <p>McNulty has suffered ongoing hamstring issues this season and, while this latest problem should clear up in a matter of days, Sunderland's medical team have sent him for a scan on his back in an attempt to find the root cause with a view to avoiding a repeat.</p>

      <p>Parkinson said: "Marc is not going to make it for tomorrow night.</p>
      <p>"He has had hamstring problems three times this season, and he has had scans which have found no muscle damage, so he has now had a scan on his back because the doctor was concerned that it might be coming from there.</p>
      <p>"It's a minor injury which will be right in three or four days' time, but we are more looking at whether we can stop this happening again."</p>
      <p>Ankle injury victims <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/charlie-wyke">Charlie Wyke</a> and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/lynden-gooch">Lynden Gooch</a> are still working their way back to fitness and will not feature tomorrow, although Parkinson is hopeful they could be in contention for the next game at Gillingham a week on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He said: "Lynden was out running today, Charlie has just been taken back a little bit to let the ankle settle down.</p>
      <p>"They won't be involved tomorrow but after the Burton game we have a ten-day break, and hopefully we can use that to get players back closer to being available."</p>
      <p>Sunderland will have to make at least one change tomorrow with midfielder <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/george-dobson">George Dobson</a> suspended after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/conor-mclaughlin">Conor McLaughlin</a> will be available after serving his own one-match ban, and he could slot in at right-back which would allow Luke O'Nien to move into midfield to fill the gap left by Dobson.</p>
