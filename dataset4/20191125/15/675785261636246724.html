      <h2>So far in this election campaign, the Tories have disguised their Twitter account as a 'fact check' account during the ITV live debate and launched a fake news 'Labour manifesto' attack website</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:21:37+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:21</time> by <a rel="author">Elaine McCahill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/elaine-mccahill/</a></address>
      <p>A Tory candidate has been caught getting his friend to act as a 'swing voter' in the latest disinformation scandal to hit the Conservative party.</p>
      <p>Lee Anderson, standing as the Conservative candidate for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, was trying to impress a journalist when he called up his pal to help him.</p>
      <p>Not realising he was still wearing a mic, he was recorded saying: "Don't make out that you don't know who I am... you know I'm the candidate, but not a friend, alright?"</p>
      <p>He told him what to do when they arrived and minutes later Mr Anderson he brought the journalist to his pal's door.</p>
      <p>Footage shows Mr Anderson telling the reporter the call was about "some leaflets that have just come for me".</p>

      <p>When they arrive at the house, his friend loudly told him: "There's no way Labour are ever going to get my vote again!"</p>
      <p>He then backed Mr Anderson's infamous proposal to have 'nuisance tenants' live in tents and work in fields.</p>
      <p>The Daily Mail team realised they had recorded him setting up the meeting when they reviewed the footage.</p>
      <p>It comes after the Tories launched a fake Labour manifesto website in another bid to confuse and mislead voters.</p>
      <p>A website with the web address "labourmanifesto.co.uk" was launched moments before the party's manifesto launch last week.</p>
      <p>The site, which features pictures of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> on a ' <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> red' background, has multiple overlapping headlines in a bid to appear like a poorly made website and features a series of Conservative attack lines.</p>
      <p>The Conservative party has also been repeatedly accused of misleading the public on social media in the election campaign.</p>
      <p>During the live TV debate between Jeremy Corbyn and Mr Johnson, the Tory press office altered its <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> account to look like an independent fact checking service.</p>
      <p>Their name changed to ‘factcheckUK’ for the duration of the ITV debate and the Conservative Party logo was removed from the page.</p>
      <p>And today the Daily Mirror revealed how the Tories paid <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/google">Google</a><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tories-pay-google-drive-postal-20951574">to drive postal vote applications</a> to their website.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mr Anderson has also hit the headlines after releasing a video saying 'nuisance' council tenants should be made to live in tents and pick potatoes for 12 hours a day.</p>

      <p>In the bizarre clip, Anderson, says: "I stood on this spot a few months ago banging on about nuisance tenants throughout this lovely estate and the fact they were making peoples lives a complete misery.</p>
      <p>"People say, 'they have got to live somewhere' - that's right, so my plan would be, and again this is just my own personal opinion, is that these people who have to live somewhere, let's have them in a tent, in the middle of a field.</p>
      <p>"Six o'clock every morning, let's have them up, let's have them in the field, picking potatoes or any other seasonal vegetables, back in the tent, cold shower, lights out, six o'clock, same again the next day. That would be my solution."</p>
