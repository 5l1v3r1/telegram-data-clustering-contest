      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - A man who authorities say hid in the Dominican Republic for more than two decades is scheduled to be arraigned on charges that he killed a man who kicked him out of a house party in Boston in 1995.</p>
      <p>Police say 46-year-old William Sanchez fled to his home country following the shooting of Jorge Medina in the early morning hours of Oct. 8, 1995.</p>
      <p>Police say Medina was working as a bouncer at the party in the city's Dorchester neighborhood and escorted Sanchez out. Prosecutors say Sanchez returned minutes later and opened fire on Medina and another person.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Sanchez's arrest was possible thanks to the extradition treaty signed in 2015.</p>
      <p>The arraignment is scheduled for Monday. It was not clear if Sanchez had retained an attorney.</p>
