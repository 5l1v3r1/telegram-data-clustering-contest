      <p>Energy Secretary Rick Perry in an interview with Fox News over the weekend described <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4">President Donald Trump</a> as the "chosen one" who was "sent by God."</p>
      <p>"God's used imperfect people all through history. King David wasn't perfect. Saul wasn't perfect. Solomon wasn't perfect," Perry said in the interview, which aired Sunday.</p>
      <p>"And I actually gave the president a little one-pager on those Old Testament kings about a month ago, and I shared it with him," he added. "I said, 'Mr. President, I know there are people that say, 'You said you were the chosen one,' and I said, 'You were.'"</p>
      <p>Perry, who is expected to leave the Cabinet at the end of the year, said he told Trump: "You didn't get here without God's blessing."</p>
      <p>The outgoing energy secretary also said: "Barack Obama didn't get to be the president of the United States without being ordained by God. Neither did Donald Trump."</p>
      <p>In a "Fox &amp; Friends" segment that offered a preview on the interview, Fox News' chief national correspondent, Ed Henry, said Perry "thinks at this moment and this time, Donald Trump was sent by God to do great things."</p>

      <p>Trump controversially <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-looked-at-sky-said-hes-chosen-one-china-2019-8">referred to himself as the "chosen one"</a> while discussing the trade war with China in August.</p>
      <p>"This is a trade war that should have taken place a long time ago," Trump said at the time.</p>
      <p>"Someone had to do it," the president said. "I am the chosen one."</p>
      <p>The president has also struggled to accurately quote and interpret the Bible. During a campaign event in 2016, for example, he cited a verse <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/01/18/463528847/citing-two-corinthians-trump-struggles-to-make-the-sale-to-evangelicals">from "Two Corinthians," the book generally written as "2 Corinthians" but pronounced "second."</a></p>
      <p>Trump's apparent lack of familiarity with scripture, however, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/10/trump-white-evangelical-impeachment/600376/">has not hurt his level of support with white evangelicals</a>.</p>
