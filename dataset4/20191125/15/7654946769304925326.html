      <h1>Michael Bloomberg to begin 2020 presidential campaign with visit to Virginia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:26:40+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:26</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Moore</a></address>
      <p>Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/michael-bloomberg-officially-declares-white-house-bid/">launched his Democratic presidential run on Sunday</a>, will hold his first campaign appearances later Monday in Norfolk, Va.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg’s campaign announced that the candidate will meet with voters and elected officials, noting that he backed 15 Democratic candidates who supported combating climate change and gun violence measures in the Virginia legislature earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Democrats won control of the state legislature for the first time in 25 years.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, who served three terms as New York’s mayor, will also have a sit-down coffee with Virginia Delegate-elect Nancy Guy, who defeated Republican incumbent Chris Stolle by just 27 votes in a Norfolk district.</p>
      <p>Stolle has asked for a recount.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, 77, announced his campaign in a statement on his website and in a video released on Twitter.</p>
      <p>In it, the billionaire media mogul said he is “running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America.”</p>
      <p>He also unveiled a $34 million ad campaign over the next week in several key battleground states.</p>
      <p>A late entry to the crowded Democratic contest, Bloomberg is expected to focus heavily on the “Super Tuesday” primary contests in 15 states on March 3.</p>
