        <b>Persik Kediri defeated Persita 3-2 at the Kapten I Wayan Dipta Stadium in Bali to lift their first-ever Indonesia Liga 2 title and book a promotion to next season’s <a href="https://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/asian-football/indonesia-liga-1/">Liga 1, the country’s top division.</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Persik and Persita will be joined by Persiraja who defeated Sriwijaya FC 1-0 in the third-place match held at the same venue earlier on Monday.</p>
      <p>In the Liga 2 final, Persik had taken a 2-0 lead by the 14th minute through Risna Prahalabenta and Sandrian Wijaya, but Persita struck back to level the score at 2-2 through former Indonesia international defender Muhammad Roby and Sirvi Arfani by the 38th minute.</p>

      <p>However, it was Persik who ultimately took home the title thanks to a winning goal from the boots of Wimba Sutan Fanosa in the second-half injury time.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Assanur Rijal scored the only goal of the game for Persiraja as they broke the hearts of Sriwijaya to win promotion as the third and final team.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the relegation race is still neck-and-neck in Indonesia’s top flight with Badak Lampung and Semen Padang, both on 27 points, and Kalteng Putra, with a point less, occupying the three relegation spots with six more matches left to play.</p>
