      <p>People who forget their wallet when they go grocery shopping might be able to pay with their face next year.</p>
      <p>A Chinese grocery store chain is looking to introduce facial-recognition as a method of payment to their Canadian stores.</p>
      <p>Wei Chengyi, owner of Foody Mart, is considering introducing Chinese-made facial recognition devices as a new form of payment at their stores in Ontario and B.C., <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/pay-with-your-face-ontario-grocery-chain-looks-at-paying-via-facial-recognition#comments-area">according to the National Post.</a></p>
      <p>Foody Mart has six locations in the Toronto area and two, under the name Foody World, in Richmond, B.C.</p>
      <p>The new system would allow customers to make purchases by capturing an image of shoppers’ faces and linking it to their chain store account, without the use of a card, cash or phone.</p>
      <p><a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/pay-with-your-face-coming-to-canada-not-everyone-on-board-142613931.html">According to Yahoo Finance</a>, the chain store plans to purchase facial recognition equipment from SnapPay, a Toronto-based platform which also supplies payment gear to Canadian retailers who accept international payment methods like AliPay and WeChat Pay.</p>
      <p>“Facial recognition technology is an increasingly popular method of payment among global consumers,” said Spencer Xu, CEO and founder of SnapPay, in a press release.</p>
      <p>He added that it will speed up and provide convenience during the checkout process at stores.</p>
      <p>Mary Markou, senior director of Retail Council of Canada, said retail stores in Canada are “eager to explore technologies that will help improve the experience for their customers.”</p>
      <p>“SnapPay is a very interesting new player offering solutions in the Canadian payments ecosystem.”</p>
      <p>SnapPay told Yahoo Finance they aim to release the first payment system to Foody Mart in the beginning of next year.</p>
