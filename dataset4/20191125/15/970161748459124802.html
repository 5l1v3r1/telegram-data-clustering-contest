      <p>The NHS is at the centre of the parties’ election campaigns, with polls suggesting that many voters consider it a higher priority than <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a>.</p>
      <p>So what are the major parties planning for the National Health Service?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Conservative</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Conservative party has pledged an extra 50,000 nurses amid a shortage of nursing staff.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson has also said that the party will bring back the nursing bursary, which the Tories themselves had scrapped.</p>

      <p>According to the manifesto, the party says it will build 40 new hospitals, bring in 6,000 new GPs, as well as free hospital parking for vulnerable groups.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives are also promising to invest £1 billion per year in social care over the next five years in a bid to stabilise the system.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Labour</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Labour party says its ‘immediate task’ will be to ‘repair our health service’, with an ‘urgent priority to end NHS privatisation’.</p>

      <p>It will also offer free dental check ups and spend an extra £1.6 billion on mental health services.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has also said that the party will invest £2bn into a mental health fund that would end unsafe dormitory wards and to roll out a fleet of crisis ambulances, along with £845m for child mental health.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Liberal Democrats</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats say they will add one penny on income tax to fund an extra £7 billion a year for the NHS and social care.</p>
      <p>Leader Jo Swinson has also pledged to treat mental health with the same urgency as physical health.</p>
      <p>The party also says it will set aside £10 billion in capital funding for facilities.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Green Party</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Green party claims it will increase the NHS budget by ‘at least’ £6billion a year every year until 2030 in its manifesto.</p>
      <p>It also pledged to reinstate the nursing bursaries and replace private sector investment with ‘community leadership’.</p>

        <b>Brexit Party</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nigel Farage’s party says it is committed to a ‘publicly-owned comprehensive service that is free at the point of use’.</p>
      <p>The party has pledged to return existing private initiatives which have failed back into public ownership, and to introduce ‘24-hour GP surgeries to relieve the strain in A&amp;E departments’.</p>
