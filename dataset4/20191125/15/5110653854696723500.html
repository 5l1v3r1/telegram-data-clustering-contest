      <h1>Week 13 Fantasy PPR RB Rankings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:10:45+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:10</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>Week 13 presents a very intriguing thought experiment in our PPR RB rankings. There are a number of workhorse, early-down running backs with tough matchups that could turn them into fantasy busts. And there are a handful of running backs who've emerged (or re-emerged) as solid pass-catching backs who gain value in PPR leagues. It's definitely difficult to make a start/sit choice between a guy you know will get 15-plus touches and another guy who you're hoping catches four or five passes.</p>
      <p>Two of the most obvious bad matchup workhorses are Houston's Carlos Hyde (vs. Patriots) and Baltimore's Mark Ingram (vs. 49ers). Those are the type of matchups that could still see each running back touch the ball 15-20 times. But if each touch is only for 2.5 yards on average, what good does that do you, especially if they're held out of the end zone?</p>

      <p>On the flip side, there are the usual suspects like James White and Austin Ekeler, along with the recently emerged Kareem Hunt and even Nyheim Hines, who's seen more value in Indy with the absence of Marlon Mack (hand). You can see where we rank them in relation below, but this is a weird floor-ceiling proposition that's hard to wrap your head around.</p>
      <p>In general, these decisions are made easier if you consider a particular game flow. The Texans could easily fall behind early against New England, which would mean Hyde's usage declines early. But Baltimore might stay in the game or even lead, making Ingram useful deeper into the contest. With the pass-catchers, it obviously works in a reverse manner. If Hunt and the Browns jump on Pittsburgh early, his involvement might be less, while if the Colts fall behind to the red-hot Ryan Tannehill and the Titans, Hines could see more usage.</p>
      <p>A few of the pass-catchers might be better plays than a younger workhorse like Bo Scarbrough (vs. Bears), too. And while we have them right in the same area as Tevin Coleman, Ronald Jones and Derrius Guice, only a few spots separate them for a reason. If you think you have those games figured out and know which pass-catching backs will be needed most, you could certainly justify playing White, Hunt or Ekeler, especially, over some of those early-down backs.</p>
