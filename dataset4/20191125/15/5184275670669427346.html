      <p>Bollywood actor Vivaan Shah’s upcoming film “<i>Ae Kaash Ke Hum</i>” is a romantic tragedy, and the actor feels Bollywood does not attempt the genre enough these days.</p>
      <p>” ‘<i>Ae Kaash Ke Hum</i>‘ is a very sweet romantic film, more a heart-wrenching romantic tragedy than a romantic comedy. It’s really a throwback to the kind of films that aren’t made anymore,” said Vivaan.</p>

      <p>Vishal Mishra, who directs the film has in the past made “<i>Coffee With D</i>“, “<i>Marudhar Express</i>” and “<i>Hotel Milan</i>“. Vivaan stars alongside and debutant Priya Singh, while Sophiya Singh plays a pivotal character. The poster of the film is out now.</p>
      <p>“Vishal Mishra is a very poetic director and it was a treat to work with the great cinematographer Anshul Chaubey, who really made each frame look like a painting. Priya Singh is a fantastic young actress who is full of emotional intensity and spontaneity as is the rest of the wonderful cast,” said Vivaan.</p>
      <p>The story of the film revolves around Ayush and Pari, played by Vivaan and Priya. The young lovers are about to confess their love for each other but a twist of fate keeps them away. When they reunite years later, Ayush must learn to love Pari, who is not herself anymore.</p>
      <p>“We have tried to revive the nostalgic feel of the ’90s, which got lost in today’s times where the rom-com are too well-packaged with plastic emotions. The film is a musical at heart with six beautifully composed songs. We have tried to keep the music very clean, free from rap, Hinglish lyrics or remixes,” said Vishal.</p>
      <p>The film is a love story about two school students, and Vivaan said it “was great to be back in school uniform”, adding: “It took me back to my boarding school days”.</p>
      <p>“<i>Ae Kaash Ke Hum</i>“, slated to release on January 17 next year, is shot in Dharamshala and MacLeodGang, and Vivaan shared: “It was spectacular to shoot in these places. All in all it was a wonderful experience and I think the film reflects that.”</p>
      <p>The film is produced by Kiran K Talasila.</p>
