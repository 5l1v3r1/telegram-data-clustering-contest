      <h1>Jack Ross calls on Sunderland experience as Hibs boss discusses hectic schedule</h1>
      <h2>The Hibees have eight games between now and the end of December to climb up the table.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:29:09+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:29</time> by <a rel="author">Gabriel McKay</a></address>
      <p>Jack Ross admits he'll call on his experience at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> to help Hibs through a hectic period which includes eight games between now and the winter break.</p>
      <p>The new manager oversaw his first win since being appointed at Easter Road, with his side coming from behind to beat <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>There's no let-up in their schedule though, with a trip to face Ross' former club St Mirren tomorrow before they take on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Hibees gaffer said: "It is pretty busy between now and the end of the year. 'I am well used to it' is probably the best thing I could say.</p>

      <p>"I had a 61-game season last year. I was used to the relentlessness of eight, nine, 10 fixtures a month. I had that quite often.</p>
      <p>"Although I say this period is quite busy, it is probably the norm for me or certainly it has been for me over the last year-and-a-half.</p>
      <p>"I have probably had to train myself and educate myself in a different way than what I had to deal with previously.</p>
      <p>"I think that is standing me in good stead for this period that we have got and then after the winter break, it settles down again.</p>

      <p>"When you have less time on the training pitch it is easier to do that and accept that when you are in good place, whether results or performance-wise."</p>
      <p>Ross gained hero status in Paisley when he got <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a> promoted and he's looking forward to returning.</p>
      <p>"I'm looking forward to it. I went back quite quickly with Sunderland in a pre-season match after I left.</p>
      <p>"It is a club and a stadium that means a lot to me, both as player and a manager.</p>

      <p>"I still speak to several people at the club, still close to them and have always kept a close eye on what they are doing.</p>
      <p>"I am looking forward to seeing some familiar faces but the focus and energy is very much about going to win the game as opposed to anything else.</p>
      <p>"What reception will I get? I don't know. You never know in football.</p>
      <p>"I had a good period there as manager and a good relationship with people there as well so hopefully a good one."</p>
