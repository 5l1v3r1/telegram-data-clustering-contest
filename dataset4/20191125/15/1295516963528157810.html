      <h1>The Batman: Josh Gad Reveals How Far Along Penguin Casting Talks Got</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:11:36+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:11</time> by <a rel="author">John Ridlehoover</a></address>
      <p>According to <a href="https://screenrant.com/batman-movie-colin-farrell-penguin-josh-gad-response/amp/">Josh Gad</a>, he never had a serious conversation with <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-batman/">The Batman</a> </i>director Matt Reeves about portraying The Penguin.</p>
      <p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/frozen-2-josh-gad-how-his-daughter-inspired-olafs-story-1257372"><i>THR</i></a>, Gad revealed he and Reeves spoke briefly about the role, though the actor didn't make a "serious attempt" to land it. "It actually started off with me posting a picture one day and just having fun trolling the Internet," he said. "This was before any Penguin project was even announced. This was before Matt Reeves was even attached to do a Batman film. At a certain point, it just became really fun because of the speculation."</p>

      <p>"There were talks along the way with DC about it," Gad continued. "There were talks along the way with Matt about it. But, the truth is, I never went in to go discuss it. I never went on tape for it."</p>
      <p>The actor went on to mention he's good friends with Reeves and is excited to see <i>The Batman. </i></p>
      <p>The Penguin role would eventually go to <a href="https://www.cbr.com/the-batman-casts-colin-farrell-as-the-penguin/">Colin Farrell</a>. The character has also been portrayed by Burgess Meredith in <i>Batman '66</i>, Danny DeVito in 1992's <i>Batman Returns </i>and Robin Lord Taylor in the Fox series <i>Gotham. </i></p>
