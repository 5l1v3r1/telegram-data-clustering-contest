      <p>The Chainsmokers are coming to a TV near you. Well, maybe. The pop duo have signed on as executive producers for a new series that’s in development at Freeform called <i>Demo</i>, which will follow an indie rocker who abandons her failing rock band to start writing pop songs.</p>
      <p>“Though at first she’s eager to shed her past, she soon discovers that the best songs tell the deepest truths — if only she can find the strength to tell hers” is how <i><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/music-drama-chainsmokers-works-at-freeform-1257877">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i> puts it. So songs like “Closer,” I guess. Or <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2023190/the-chainsmokers-beach-house-song/video/">that one</a> about listening to Beach House that wasn’t actually about listening to Beach House.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the Chainsmokers first foray into the TV/movie world. Last year, it was reported that they were <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2021757/the-chainsmokers-producing-movie-based-on-their-song-paris/news/">producing a movie</a> based on their song “Paris.” Unclear whether that’s still moving forward. Best of luck to you, Chainsmokers. Here are <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2021762/chainsmokers-movie-paris/franchises/sounding-board/">some recommendations</a> if you need help figuring out what to produce next!</p>
