      <p>The chaotic rhythm-based gameplay of <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/just_shapes_and_beats"><b>Just Shapes &amp; Beats</b></a> is about to get a whole lot "Shovelier" with the launch of some new and exclusive <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shovel_knight_treasure_trove"><b>Shovel Knight</b></a> tracks headed our way on 4th December.</p>
      <p>Developer Berzerk Studio has teamed up with Yacht Club Games to release Just Shapes &amp; Beats' second free batch of DLC, known as 'Mixtapes', and features four exclusive remixes of beloved tracks from the games. Plague Knight, Specter Knight, King Knight and, of course, Shovel Knight will all get in on the musical bullet-hell action.</p>
      <p>Here's the lowdown (you can get a sneaky listen in the new trailer above):</p>
      <blockquote>- Danimal Cannon - Strike the Earth! (remix)<br/>- Rainbowdragoneyes - Flowers of Antimony (remix)<br/>- Kubbi - In the Halls of the Usurper (remix)<br/>- Shirobon - La Danse Macabre (remix) &lt;--- BRAND NEW BOSS</blockquote>
      <p>These new tracks can be played in the game's Challenge mode and can be unlocked using Beat Points or with <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/08/shovel_knights_amiibo_3-pack_launches_this_december_game_functionality_detailed">each character's respective amiibo figure</a>. As it happens, full amiibo support is also on the way, with <i>any</i> other figure of your choosing granting you 100 Beat Points per day (up to five times) when you scan it.</p>
      <p>
        <i>You don't need to ask us twice when it comes to more Shovel Knight music. Just Shapes &amp; Beats is available from the eShop for £15.09.</i>
