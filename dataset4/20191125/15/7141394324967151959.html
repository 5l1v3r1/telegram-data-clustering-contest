      <h1>Ethereum Creator Vitalik Buterin Says ETH Will Shatter 3,000 Transactions Per Second Post-Istanbul</h1>

      <p>Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin says he believes the leading blockchain smart contract platform will be able to process 3,000 transactions per second after a series of improvements are implemented.</p>
      <p>In a new tweet, Buterin outlines some of the upgrades coming to Ethereum.</p>

      <p>Ethereum’s Istanbul update is currently set for launch in early December.</p>
      <p>In addition, Buterin is updating a list of what he says are some of the hardest problems facing the cryptocurrency space.</p>
      <p>The list was first published in 2014. Now, five years later, he’s revisiting his entries, which cover diverse topics relating to mathematics, computer science, and economics, and parsing the progress – or lack thereof – made on each.</p>
      <p>He highlights the crypto industry’s efforts to implement proof-of-stake and new privacy measures, as well as creating stablecoins that hold their value.</p>
      <p>Some entries overlap with his previous list, including cryptographic obfuscation, oracles (decentralized success metrics), unique human identities (anti-sybil systems) and reputation systems.</p>
      <p>New ones include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Ongoing work on post-quantum cryptography: both hash-based as well as based on post-quantum-secure ‘structured’ mathematical objects, eg. elliptic curve isogenies, lattices…</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Anti-collusion infrastructure: ongoing work and refinement of <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413">https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413</a>, including adding privacy against the operator, adding multi-party computation in a maximally practical way, etc…</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Homomorphic encryption and multi-party computation: ongoing improvements are still required for practicality</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Decentralized governance mechanisms: DAOs are cool, but current DAOs are still very primitive; we can do better</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Fully formalizing responses to PoS 51% attacks: ongoing work and refinement of <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/responding-to-51-attacks-in-casper-ffg/6363">https://ethresear.ch/t/responding-to-51-attacks-in-casper-ffg/6363</a></i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>More sources of public goods funding: the ideal is to charge for congestible resources inside of systems that have network effects (eg. transaction fees), but doing so in decentralized systems requires public legitimacy; hence this is a social problem along with the technical one of finding possible source…</i>
