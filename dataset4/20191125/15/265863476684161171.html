      <p>David Adefeso celebrated his 50th birthday a few days ago. He told fans on his social media account that he wasn’t into birthdays, but then Tamar Braxton taught him that it’s okay to focus on yourself and celebrate your own anniversary. Check out the emotional message below.</p>
      <p>‘Growing up, like many others in my family, I was never really into birthdays. I was a studious, shy, and relatively introverted kid who could never figure out why anyone would want that much attention focused on them….and for the whole day too?!!?😫😫🤭🤭,’ David began his post.</p>
