      <h1>Massive new 'affordable' homes site in Exeter will include school, retail centre and doctor’s surgery</h1>
      <h2>The joint venture with Bovis Homes will see 678 new homes built in Exeter</h2>

      <p>To meet the growing need for more affordable homes to buy and rent in Exeter,  nearly 700 news homes are being built in the city on a site which will include a school and retail centre.</p>
      <p>LiveWest, the largest housing provider of affordable housing in the region, and national house-builder Bovis Homes, have began infrastructure on land off the A379 in the Matford and Alphington area.</p>
      <p>The investment will include building a park, school, retail centre, community centre and doctor’s surgery.</p>
      <p>The project will take until at least until 2034 to complete.</p>

      <p>What else is being built on the site - the press release says other facilities might be added. Further investment will be made to improve roads and sustainable travel initiatives.</p>
      <p>The project is part of LiveWest's ambitious plans to deliver 16,000 homes over the next 10 years which equates to a £2 billion investment into the south west economy.</p>
      <p>The joint venture with Bovis Homes will see 678 new homes built in Exeter, 398 in Tavistock and the latest scheme to be announced will see 831 new homes built in Taunton.</p>
      <p>Russell Baldwinson, LiveWest’s executive director of development, said: “We’re pleased to be working with Bovis Homes to build much-needed housing, and provide local people and families with secure, long-term homes that they can afford to buy and rent. </p>
      <p>“LiveWest is continually looking at innovative ways to provide new homes, and being involved in commercial ventures such as this enables us to generate profits that we can reinvest into building more affordable homes in areas where there is a significant need.</p>
      <p>“These three developments mean we provide the affordable homes that would have come forward through planning, but also additional affordable housing which LiveWest and Homes England are funding.</p>
      <p>“With our ambitious strategy to build 16,000 homes over the next 10 years, we are looking forward to working with Bovis Homes across the South West on the next phase of our plans.”</p>
      <p>Both the Taunton and Exeter developments have benefited from government-grant funding from Homes England.</p>
      <p>Peter Jones, head of affordable housing for south west, at Homes England, said: “This is an excellent example of Homes England working with partners to build more homes faster, helping communities and providing affordable housing. We look forward to increasing the supply of affordable housing in key cities and towns in the south west.”</p>
