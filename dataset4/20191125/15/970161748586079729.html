      <p>A Chihuahua reversed a car across a busy four-lane road and crashed it.</p>
      <p>The tiny dog, whose name was not given, managed to put her owners’ SUV in reverse after they stopped to get gas in Slidell, Louisiana, on Friday.</p>
      <p>Surveillance footage shows the couple’s Hyundai begin to roll back across the garage forecourt, while the woman stood next to it frantically tries to open its door.</p>
      <p>But she is unable to keep up with her runaway car and falls to the ground just as it slides out onto the busy road.</p>
      <p>Miraculously, the car managed to roll across all four lanes without causing a collision.</p>

      <p>It continued on in to the forecourt of another gas station, and finally came to a stop after colliding with a ledge.</p>

      <p>Slidell Police Department shared a photo of the Chihuahua after, who appeared none the worse for the ordeal.</p>
      <p>They said: ‘We Can’t Make This Stuff Up</p>
