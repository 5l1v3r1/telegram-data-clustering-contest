      <p>T.I. and his wife Tiny sat down on Jada Pinkett Smith's <i>Red Table Talk</i> to address controversial <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/258815/ti-says-he-takes-his-daughter-to-gynecologist-to-check-her-hymen">comments he made</a> about taking his now-18-year-old daughter to the OBGYN to check to see if she's still a virgin. </p>
      <p>Tip cleared up misconceptions about his comments, stating, "From a place of truth, I began to embellish and exaggerate and I think a lot of people took it extremely literal." He added that he now knows "absolutely" understands the sensitivities surrounding the situation now, and Tip went on to state that his daughter "did have a problem with me talking about it however, and I understand that, and I am incredibly apologetic to her for that. he understands my intentions and she knows who I am, who I’ve always been." </p>
