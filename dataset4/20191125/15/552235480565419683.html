      <p>A West Lothian business has set up a scheme that allows staff one day off a year to work on community-projects.</p>
      <p>Calnex Solutions from Linlithgow created the initiative at the start of the year and already have completed projects with Burgh Beautiful and Transition Linlithgow.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the project the human resources manager at Calnex, Claire Wishart, said: “Out first Calnex in the Community initiatives have been a great success from both an employee wellbeing and team building perspective, and we’ve managed to support and make a difference in the Linlithgow community where our HQ is based. We can’t wait to commit to our next community support project!”</p>
      <p>The staff were invited to suggest ideas for projects where the workforce could work together as a group. Soon they were in touch with Transition Linlithgow - who promote environment sustainability - and they agreed on a day of tree planting at Beecraigs Country Park in October.</p>
      <p>Some of the trees at the park had reached maturity and been felled so they were there to plant new native species to the area which are considered better for biodiversity. They had a productive day and planted more than 300 trees.</p>
      <p>The communication manager at Transition Linlithgow, Neil Hutson, said: “The team at Calnex did a fantastic job working with Transition Linlithgow and West Lothian Council during their tree planting session back in October. In total more than 300 native trees were planted, helping to reforest the area at Cockleroy, increase vital biodiversity and combat climate change at a local level”</p>
      <p>More recently the Calnex in the Community project moved onto helping the Linlithgow Burgh Beautiful to clear the flower beds on Linlithgow High Street in preparation for the winter plants.</p>
      <p>Burgh Beautiful’s secretary, Mel Oxbrow, said: “Burgh Beautiful is very grateful for help from Calnex volunteers who helped clear the summer annuals from the Serpentine bed in town. Fantastic job!”</p>
