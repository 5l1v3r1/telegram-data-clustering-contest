        <b>The 2019/20 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) continued to throw up unpredictable results as games for week five took place on Sunday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Plateau United, league leaders, extended their unbeaten run to five following a 3-1 victory over Delta Force in Asaba while Akwa Starlets defeated Rangers 2-0.</p>
      <p>Our team of the week is set up in a 4-3-3 formation, with Abdu Maikaba, Plateau United tactician, the man at the dugout.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Vincent Edafe – Akwa Starlets</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fans at the Cathedral won’t forget the young keeper who was heroic for Akwa Starlets in their win over Rangers. The fearless lad produced six world class saves during the game that was played in Enugu.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kunle Odunlami – Rivers United</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Nigeria international comes to right back following his scintillating show for Rivers United in the South/South derby.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Festus Austine – Rivers United</b>
      </p>
      <p>You begin to wonder where Festus Austine gets the bullets in his armory to shoot the enemies. He was at his “no-nonsense” best in the win against Warri Wolves.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ibukun Harrison – Akwa Starlets</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ibukun Harrison commanded the back four and never gave Rangers’ strikers the chance to wreck havoc. The former Akwa United defender had every answers to the questions asked by the Flying Antelopes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Daniel Itodo – Plateau United</b>
      </p>
      <p>One wouldn’t be out of place to lay claim to the fact that Daniel Itodo is the best left back in the NPFL. The way he penetrated the walls of Delta Force was spectacular.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Michael Ibe – Plateau United</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former fans favourite of Al-Karmah did a yeoman’s job at the middle of the park. He dictated the pace and was rewarded with a goal.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cletus Emotan – Rivers United</b>
      </p>
      <p>If Rivers United really want to challenge for the league title, then the pint sized midfielder must always produce the goods. Sunday wasn’t different as he piloted the ship and provided an assist.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Aniekan Ekpe – Akwa Starlets</b>
      </p>
      <p>Age is only a number. Quality overshadows quantity in key situations. Former Akwa United skipper Aniekan Ekpe was turbo-charged to set the Cathedral ablaze on Sunday.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Gambo Mohammed – Katsina United</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Katsina United marquee singing provided the assist for Tasiu Lawal’s strike and capped an excellent day in office with a goal of his own.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Victor Mbaoma – Enyimba</b>
      </p>
      <p>Victor Mbaoma popped up with a brace for the impressive Enyimba, which humbled Adamawa United 2-0 in Aba.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mustapha Ibrahim – Plateau United</b>
      </p>
      <p>The third Plateau United player in the XI. Mustapha Ibrahim led the line well and linked up with his teammates to perfection. He got a goal of his own against Delta Force. His third of the season.</p>
