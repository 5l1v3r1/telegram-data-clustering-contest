      <p>As of 5.55pm police have confirmed the light aircraft had "one pilot on board" and no other passengers.</p>
      <p>Lifeboats are also involved in the operation after the plane "disappeared from radar contact" shortly before 1pm today.</p>
      <p>Chief inspector Essi Ahari told reporters that "family liaison officers are supporting the missing pilot’s family".</p>

      <p>He added: "The light aircraft was flying from Caernarfon Airport to the Great Orme in Llandudno and back this afternoon."</p>
      <p>Police were initially called at 12.59pm to reports of a "possible crash".</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/live-reports-plane-crash-anglesey-17313135">North Wales Live</a> reports it the light aircraft was most likely privately owned.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Coastguard told Mirror Online: "HM Coastguard is currently co-ordinating a search and rescue in the Puffin Island area of North Wales following a report at 12.47pm today that an aircraft had disappeared from radar contact.</p>
      <p>"The search and rescue helicopter from Caernarfon has been sent as well as Coastguard Rescue Teams from Penmon and Bangor and a Senior Coastguard Operations Officer.</p>
      <p>"The RNLI lifeboats from Beaumaris, Moelfre and Llandudno and North Wales Police have been sent."</p>
      <p>The search was continuing in the dark as of 6pm.</p>

      <p>FlightRadar24, which tracks the path of aircraft in the UK, showed a Cessna 172S Skyhawk had gone down.</p>
      <p>One twitter user tweeted: "I was just looking on playback and it literally fell out of the sky."</p>
      <p>A picture from the scene shows a large-scale police presence at the waterfront.</p>
      <p>Police said: "We received a call at 12.59pm today (Monday) reporting a possible crash involving a light aircraft in the Penmon area. Officers are currently assisting HM Coastguard and our enquiries are ongoing."</p>

      <p>The plane is believed to have taken off from Caernarfon Airport before it vanished.</p>
      <p>Flight data from FlightRadar24 appears to show the Cessna light aircraft taking off from the Gwynedd airport before heading north east towards Llandudno.</p>
      <p>As it flies over Llandudno , it begins to turn back and heads towards Anglesey , before the radar loses track of the plane at around the time the alarm was raised.</p>
      <p>It has not been confirmed whether this is the missing plane by officials.</p>
