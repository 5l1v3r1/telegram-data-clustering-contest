      <h1>Columnist Thinks Michigan Could Sneak Into Playoff Picture With Ohio State Win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:27:08+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Michigan hasn’t been part of the College Football Playoff discussion for quite some time, but one columnist thinks that there is a way that the Wolverines could sneak back into the picture. Dan Wolken of USA Today has an interesting take on Michigan’s chances if it can beat Ohio State.</p>
      <p>Michigan has lost two games this season – to Wisconsin and Penn State. But the Wolverines also have some solid victories over Notre Dame and Iowa. If they can add a win over the Buckeyes, Wolken thinks they would have to be “in the conversation” for the No. 4 slot – provided the playoff picture gets muddled.</p>
      <p>What would have to happen for Michigan to sneak in? A lot of things.</p>
      <p>First, Ohio State would have to turn around and beat Minnesota or Wisconsin in the Big Ten title game. Auburn would have to beat Alabama. LSU would have to beat Georgia. Oklahoma and/or Utah might also have to slip up.</p>

      <p>In short, you’d have to have a situation where LSU, Ohio State and Clemson were the only three obvious choices, with every other major player having two losses. Then maybe Michigan’s wins could get it in.</p>
      <p>It’s a long shot, but hey, we’ve seen crazier things happen. Michigan has a 5% chance of making the playoff if it beats Ohio State, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-college-football-predictions/?ex_cid=rrpromo">per FiveThirtyEight.</a></p>
      <p>Ohio State is the favorite, but Michigan is playing well right now. It should be an incredible atmosphere, yet again.</p>
