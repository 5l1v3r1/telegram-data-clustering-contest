      <p>Pet owners should seek immediate medical care if they develop unusual <a href="https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/default.htm">flu</a>-like symptoms, doctors say after a case study about a 63-year-old man in Germany who died of a rare infection contracted when he was licked by his dog.</p>
      <p>The infection was caused by <i>capnocytophaga canimorsus</i> bacteria, which is commonly found in the mouths of dogs and cats, but rarely transmitted to humans, <i>CNN</i> reported.</p>
      <p>The case study was published in the <i>Journal of Case Reports in Internal Medicine</i>.</p>
      <p>In May, doctors amputated an Ohio woman's legs and hands after she contracted a <i>capnocytophaga canimorsus</i> infection, likely caused when her puppy licked an open cut, <i>CNN</i> reported.</p>
      <p>Last year, a Wisconsin's man nose and limbs were <a href="https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/definition-amputation">amputated</a> after he contracted the same type of infection.</p>
      <p><i>Capnocytophaga canimorsus</i> is "completely normal flora of a dog's mouth and usually doesn't cause any sort of significant disease. However, in the wrong place, at the wrong time, in the wrong patient ... it can lead to severe infections -- but very, very rarely," Dr. Stephen Cole, lecturer in veterinary microbiology, University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, told <i>CNN</i>.</p>
