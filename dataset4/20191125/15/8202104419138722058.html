      <h1>Higher call volumes, homicides, push police overtime over budget</h1>

      <p>Saskatoon police, for the first nine months of the year, are about $233,000 over its overtime budget than where it should be in September. The overtime is attributed to call-outs related to higher than normal calls for service and serious incident investigations.</p>

      <h3>By the end of the first nine months of 2019, spikes in violent crime and a sustained increase in calls for service pushed Saskatoon police beyond their overtime budget.</h3>
      <p>Police overtime generally falls into a couple of different categories: “recoverable,” which is overtime costs that can be charged back to community groups or are funded by the province, and “unrecoverable,” which is unplanned overtime.</p>
      <p>This includes overtime that comes with crime spikes and serious incidents that lead to officers being called in to work, Chief Troy Cooper said.</p>

      <p>The police force has budgets for patrol units and for detectives that sometimes take a hit, he said. Police have completed an analysis to the end of September and found that spending on overtime was $233,000 higher than hoped for at that time of the year. This cost only accounts for overtime related to call-outs.</p>
      <p>“We know we have to look for other ways to find that money within our existing budget or other opportunities to save so that we can account for that,” Cooper said.</p>
      <p>Most of this overtime will be paid to patrol members for increased call-outs and for things like responding to increased crime in Pleasant Hill in the spring and summer.</p>
      <p>To try to ease some of the pressure on police who had been called upon to work overtime, in September Cooper invoked an emergency clause in the collective bargaining agreement which allows him to make changes to employee schedules in emergency situations, enabling him to expand the scope of officers who can be called out.</p>
      <p>To date, this remains in effect.</p>
      <p>Police are limiting involvement in work outside the city because the force doesn’t have the capacity, Cooper said.</p>
      <p>The police administration started working on its multi-year budget before call volumes increased, and reworked its 2020 and 2021 budgets, including an added request for additional officers after its proposed budget was approved by the board of police commissioners, Cooper said. The police board earlier this month approved the additional request for eight new officers to focus patrols on the area outside the supervised consumption site expected to open next year on 20th Street West.</p>
      <p>Dean Pringle, president of the Saskatoon Police Association — the union representing city police officers — said eight officers have retired so far this year, and one more is expected to retire by January. Since the eight added officers will be monitoring the safe consumption site and are factored out, the police force is really down by six officers, he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s kind of dire straits here. Given that we usually have six to 10 members retire per year, at a minimum, we have to hire that amount in a year just to stay neutral.”</p>

      <p>Pringle said he wants to see <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/saskatoon-police-table-first-multi-year-budget-with-2020-2021-plans">a shortage of 40 officers identified in an audit addressed. </a>He noted Cooper’s statement to the police board at the Sept. 19 meeting that if the police force are to keep up with a 1.5 per cent population growth projected by the city, seven new officers a year would need to be hired.</p>
      <p>Pringle said the focus needs to rest at city hall, since city council and the police board ultimately approve funding for police.</p>
      <p>“I think the chief is certainly asking and laying out a good case for more officers and whether he’s listened to, time will tell. But what is being proposed won’t really fix the problem of our personnel shortage,” he said.</p>
      <p>Last year — a less busy year by comparison to 2019 — 42 police staff, both sworn officers and a few programmer analysts, earned more than $10,000 each for overtime hours worked in 2018, according to public accounts documents. Two 10th-year constables earned more than $30,000 in overtime.</p>
      <p>In its proposed budget for 2020, police are requesting 11 new sworn officers and two new civilian staff positions, and the changeover of one open senior officer position to then executive director of corporate services, a job now filled by Clae Hack, the city’s former director of finance.</p>
      <p>For 2021, police are requesting four additional officers and two new civilian staff.</p>
      <p>The proposed net operating budget for police in 2020 is $98,853,900; for 2021, it’s $103,190,300.</p>
      <p>The proposed budget is up for approval by city council’s budget committee next week.</p>
