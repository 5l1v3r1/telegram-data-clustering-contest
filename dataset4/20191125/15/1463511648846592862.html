      <p>Two engineers were on Monday brought before a Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos State for allegedly causing the collapse of a two-storey building, which led to the death of a bricklayer.</p>
      <p>The defendants: Benjamin John, 36, and Akin Tinuoya, 31, were arraigned on charges of conspiracy and negligent act causing harm.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor, ASP Roman Unuigbe, told the court that the defendants committed the offences at 4.00p.m on November 1, at No. 36A Glover Court, Ikoyi, Lagos State.</p>
      <p>According to Unuigbe, the defendants are part of a group of engineers employed to erect the two-story building for residential purposes.</p>
      <p>He told the court that the defendants conspired with the other engineers and collected money from the contractors in exchange for the delivery of quality building materials.</p>
      <p>He said that this resulted in building of the structure with inferior materials.</p>
      <p>Unuigbe submitted that the negligence of the defendants caused the collapse of the building that killed a bricklayer working on it.</p>
      <p>“My lord, the police were only able to apprehend these two defendants, the others absconded after the collapse but we are tracking them.</p>
      <p>“We are also running tests on the debris to present as further evidence,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said that the offences contravened Sections 411 and 252 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (revised).</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria reports that both sections stipulate two years’ jail term each for conspiracy and negligent act causing harm.</p>
      <p>The Chief Magistrate, Peter Ojo, granted each of the defendants bail in the sum of N500,000 each with two sureties in like sum.</p>
      <p>Ojo said that the sureties must be gainfully employed and have landed property within the court’s jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>He also ordered that the sureties must show evidence of three years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government.</p>
      <p>He adjourned the case until January 13, 2020, for mention. </p>
