      <h1>Chiefs Boss: We Were Non-Existent In The Midfield</h1>

      <p>Kaizer Chiefs’ midfield was ‘non-existent’ and their defence was ‘not alert’ as they were beaten by Maritzburg United on Sunday – that’s according to their head coach.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Ernst Middendorp was disappointed with his side’s performance in their 2-1 defeat over the weekend as they were sent packing in the Telkom Knockout, explaining in his post-match interview that he felt they underestimated their opponent going into the game.</p>
      <p>The loss means that the club’s longest-ever trophy drought will stretch into 2020, and the coach admits that it’s a ‘blow’ for them.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Chiefs’ official website after the loss, Middendorp said, “It is a disappointing situation… We didn’t meet the expectations of ‘a favourite team’ going into this match. It is an unexpected loss and a blow to our trophies ambition. </p>
      <p>“We were non-existent in the midfield and we were not alert in defence, perhaps owing to the absence of the suspended Erick Mathoho, Willard Katsande and Daniel Akpeyi.” </p>
      <p>Now they lick their wounds and turn their attentions to Stellenbosch, and the German wants them to bounce back, saying, “It’s time to quickly reorganise… We are currently on form in the league, we have to move with speed to the next game on Wednesday. We only have a day to recover and travel to Cape Town. </p>
      <p>“It is no doubt, we didn’t perform the way we expected. After equalising you always think you’re back in it, but it didn’t work for us on the day. Next game is Wednesday and we must move on.”</p>

      <p>Chiefs will travel to Cape Town this week ahead of the clash at Cape Town Stadium on Wednesday evening.  </p>
