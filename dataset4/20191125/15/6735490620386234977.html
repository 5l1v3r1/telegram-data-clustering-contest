      <h1>Phoebe Waller-Bridge Weighs-In On Fleabag’s Future: ‘I Don’t Know Where She Is’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:46:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:46</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel West</a></address>
      <p>The critically-acclaimed creator and star of “Fleabag” says she’s unsure where her alter-ego is right now.</p>
      <p>“I really, honestly don’t know where she is,” Phoebe Waller-Bridge said during an <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/phoebe-waller-bridge-fleabag-future-talk">in-conversation event</a> in New York City on Sunday night. “She” of course, is Fleabag, the otherwise unnamed title character of her series based on Waller-Bridge’s one-woman stage show. The series became a cultural phenomenon, particularly after the second season debuted on Amazon Prime with Andrew Scott as an unnamed priest, affectionately dubbed “hot Priest” by the Internet.</p>

      <p>While fans may be clamouring for more, Waller-Bridge is holding true to her promise to end her “Fleabag” series after two seasons. She responded to audience groans during the town hall, jokingly giving Fleabag a happily ever after, adding, “She lives by the sea! Priest rides in on a donkey, [and she’s like] ‘Oh, you came back for me!'”</p>
      <p>Waller-Bridge, 34, took home three Emmys for “Fleabag”, including Best Actress, Best Comedy and Best Writing In A Comedy. The gold statuettes are in a safe place, for now, she reveals.</p>
      <p>“My mum’s got <i>all</i> of them. I haven’t been home since the Emmys so they’ve gone ahead of me to get London already,” she added.</p>
      <p>The actress first debuted her one-woman production at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, before revival stints in London’s West End and an off-Broadway run in 2019. Waller-Bridge reveals she bid farewell to the character of Fleabag during the last show, getting emotional on stage in her final performance.</p>

      <p>“I started getting sort of panicky because I could feel the character leaving me and I remember feeling like, ‘No, no, we have one more show!’ I felt her go,” she added. “It was such a lovely feeling… I don’t actually know where she is now and I think that’s the right thing for both of us.”</p>
