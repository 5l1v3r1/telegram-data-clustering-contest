      <h1>Gary Neville advises Mauricio Pochettino on taking Arsenal manager's job</h1>
      <h2>Mauricio Pochettino has been linked with a number of clubs including Bayern Munich, Manchester United and most surprising, Arsenal, since being sacked as Tottenham boss</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:21:31+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:21</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Gary Neville has warned Mauricio Pochettino that success might be hard to come by if he replaces Unai Emery at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal.</a></p>
      <p>Pochettino was sacked by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> last Tuesday after five years at the club and replaced by former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Pochettino has already been linked with the Bayern Munich job, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's role at Manchester United and, most surprisingly, Unai Emery's position at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a>.</p>
      <p>Emery is struggling at Arsenal, with the club failing to win in their past six fixtures.</p>
      <p>A growing number of Gunners fans want to see Emery sacked, and some are calling for Pochettino - who guided Spurs to a first Champions League final last season - to be given the job.</p>

      <p>Neville has discussed the possibility of Pochettinho taking over from Emery, and has warned the Argentine it may be a tough job to take on.</p>
      <p>"Mauricio Pochettino will get linked with every single job in the next three months," Neville told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"I think he is in a position where he can select where he goes next, he's in a strong position and his next job will be one of the super clubs in Europe.</p>
      <p>"Arsenal would be interesting. It's happened before George Graham going the other way. Would Spurs fans like that? Would Mauricio do that? Would Arsenal do that?</p>
      <p>"I'm not sure Mauricio would want to do something like that to Spurs.</p>
      <p>"Taking over at Arsenal would be similar to the job he just left at Tottenham, in the sense that there is some investment and spending, but it's limited.</p>
      <p>"He's not going to go to Arsenal and win the league in the next two years.</p>

      <p>"Whatever the next job Mauricio takes, he will want to win trophies, that will be the most important factor in the decision."</p>
      <p>Neville added: "I don't know what was going on inside Spurs, but I'm less definite than I was a few years ago about sacking managers.</p>
      <p>"From Mauricio's point of view, it would have been better for this all to have happened at the end of a season, but it unfortunately doesn't work like that."</p>
