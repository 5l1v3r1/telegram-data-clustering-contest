      <h2>Shall they replace Caroline Flack?</h2>

      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> reckon <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Dec Donnelly</a> should host the next series of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/reality-tv/love-island/">Love Island</a>.</p>
      <p>During last night's episode of the jungle-themed show, a live Bushtucker trial took place and it was based on the ITV2 reality programme.</p>
      <p>The trial saw the campmates take on a string of different challenges as the jungle was set up to look like the Love Island villa.</p>

      </p>
      <p>And it seems viewers loved seeing Ant and Dec in that setting so much, they want the duo to replace Caroline Flack on the reality series next year.</p>
      <p>One person said on Twitter: "Petition for Ant &amp; Dec to present Love Island 2020."</p>

      <p>A third added: "Flack needs to step aside and let Ant &amp; Dec present Love Island."</p>

      <p>Last night's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/ant-mcpartlin-and-dec-donnelly-hit-back-as-viewers-claim-im-a-celebrity-live-trial-was-fixed/">live trial caused a stir among viewers</a>, who slammed the final task which James Haskell and Roman Kemp had to undergo.</p>
      <p>They had to lie in a double bed filled with snakes and James had to try and unscrew three stars in blue boxes, which were filled with a crab, spiders and cockroaches.</p>
      <p>James then had to pass the star to Roman and he had to screw it into the corresponding yellow box, which were also filled with critters.</p>
      <p>The pair had just 90 seconds to try and get the final three stars but didn't manage to complete the task, meaning Ian, Cliff Parisi and Andy Whyment weren't going to be getting the reward - a roast dinner.</p>

      <p>Viewers were unimpressed with the challenge, with many saying it was "impossible" to complete in 90 seconds.</p>
      <p>One person said on Twitter: "Time on last task was totally ridiculous. Thought it was 90 sec per star not 90 sec altogether. Impossible."</p>
      <p>Another said: "There was no way anyone on this earth could have completed James &amp; Roman's trial in 90secs! Be fair and feed the last 3 will ya #ImACelebrity2019. Shouldn't have had less than 3 mins on that. (sic)"</p>

      <p>Ant and Dec replied on their joint Twitter page: "The stand ins did it when we tested it."</p>
      <p>Ofcom <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-could-face-ofcom-investigation-over-unfair-live-bushtucker-trial/">even received 48 complaints over the trial</a> and a spokesperson confirmed: "We are assessing these complaints against our broadcasting rules, before deciding whether or not to investigate."</p>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity continues tonight at 9pm on ITV.</p>
