      <h2>Galway goalkeeper Colm Callanan and Limerick's Richie McCarthy have both decided to walk away from inter-county hurling</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:32:14+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/robert-hynes/" target="_blank">Robert Hynes</a></address>
      <p>Two All-Ireland winners have today called time on their inter-county careers.</p>
      <p>Galway goalkeeper Colm Callanan and Limerick's Richie McCarthy have both decided to walk away from inter-county hurling.</p>
      <p>Callanan, 37, lifted the Liam MacCarthy Cup with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/galway-gaa">the Tribesmen</a> in 2017 before McCarthy, 32, tasted victory with Limerick 12 months later.</p>
      <p>Both men also won All-Stars in their careers, with Callanan making the 2015 team while McCarthy received one in 2013. </p>
      <p>Commenting on his decision to retire, Callanan said: "After 13 years wearing the maroon and white jersey, and after careful consideration, I have made the decision to step away from the Galway senior hurling panel. It’s a massive privilege to play for your county and I feel honoured and proud that I got to play for Galway for as long as I did. I was lucky enough to win everything on offer at least once.</p>
      <p>"I was blessed to have shared a dressingroom with such brilliant people throughout my career, which enabled me to forge friendships that will last a lifetime. It was an honour to go into battle with all of those Galway players, while it was also a privilege to get the opportunity to play against the very best players from other counties.</p>

      <p>"I was also lucky to have enjoyed the support of excellent managers, coaches and backroom team members over the years. Special mention must go to the managers I played under – Ger Loughnane, John McIntyre, Anthony Cunningham and Micheal Donoghue.</p>
      <p>"I’d particularly like to extend huge thanks to Christy O’Connor for being my goalkeeping coach all the way back to before I started with Galway in 2007. Christy opened my mind as to what was required at the top level, and he really lifted my standards.</p>
      <p>"I’m indebted to my club Kinvara for all their support and loyalty over the years. I want to pay tribute to all the coaches that helped me improve my game, which enabled me progress and go on and play for Galway.</p>
      <p>"I’d also like to thank the various county board members which looked after us over the years.</p>
      <p>"Most of all though, I’d like to thank my family. My wife Jen has always provided the amazing support which allowed me to chase my dream for so long. Her patience and understanding facilitated the longevity of my career, especially with our two young kids at home, Ciara and Daniel. I hope I made ye all proud.</p>
      <p>"I’d also like to pay a special thanks to my parents, Mary &amp; Gerry and my sisters, Colleen and Roisin. It was the best feeling ever to share some of those golden moments with them after matches.</p>
      <p>"I’m content that I gave everything I had to the Galway jersey for 13 years. I’ve loved every minute of my journey and to have played in front of its dedicated and passionate supporters has allowed me to make memories that I will cherish forever.</p>
      <p>"I’d also like to thank Shane O’Neill for his understanding and support of my decision. I’m also delighted that the transition will be made easier after accepting a coaching role in Shane’s new backroom team.</p>
      <p>"Let the next chapter begin! Up Galway!"</p>
      <p>McCarthy said: “Today I am announcing my retirement from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/limerick-gaa">the Limerick Senior Hurling team</a>. It has been an incredible 11 year journey but the time is right for me to now step away.</p>

      <p>"It is the greatest honour for any <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/gaa">GAA</a> player to wear their county colours but it has also been the wild dreams of a youngster from Kilfinane.</p>
      <p>"To all of my teammates who have worked so hard to achieve what we have achieved, all I can say is thank you, it has been a pleasure. I am left with many great memories including the greatest of all when I was able to lift the Liam McCarthy in front of Hill 16.</p>
      <p>"I would like to thank and acknowledge the immeasurable contribution of the many management, medical and back room teams I have been with for over a decade as well as the help and support I received from the Limerick County Board.</p>
      <p>"Thank you also to my club Blackrock for your support and belief in me as a player.</p>
      <p>"To the supporters of Limerick, I want to say a huge thank you. Your continued belief and support of us is everything that makes playing for Limerick so special.</p>
      <p>"Finally, to my family, my parents Henry and Ann and in particular my partner Ruth who have been an enormous support  to me and who I owe so much to.</p>
      <p>"I would like to wish John, Declan and all the panel the very best for the coming year. I look forward to playing with Blackrock for many years to come."</p>
