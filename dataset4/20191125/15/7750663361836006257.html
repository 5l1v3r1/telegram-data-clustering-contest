      <p>Here, the PA news agency takes a look at how things stand in each group and who can qualify for the last 16 of the competition after this week's matches.</p>
      <h3>Group A</h3>

      <p>Paris St Germain have already secured their place in the knock-out stages and will top the group if they avoid defeat.</p>
      <p>Zinedine Zidane's Real Madrid will guarantee qualification with a win at PSG, but can go through before their match if Club Brugge fail to beat Galatasaray in Tuesday's early kick-off.</p>
      <p>If the Belgian side win and Real fail to take maximum points, Club Brugge will have to beat the Spanish outfit on the final matchday to reach the last 16.</p>
      <h3>Group B</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Bayern Munich will be crowned group winners if they defeat Red Star Belgrade or Tottenham fail to beat Olympiacos, having already booked their place in the next round.</p>
      <p>Spurs will join them if they avoid defeat at home to Olympiacos and Red Star Belgrade fail to beat Bayern in Serbia.</p>
      <p>Red Star must beat Bayern or hope Spurs do not defeat Olympiacos to keep their hopes of advancing alive, likewise with the Greek side having to win at the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a> Stadium.</p>
      <h3>Group C</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://image.assets.pressassociation.io/v2/image/production/9b0f686670c76ad9f2a71ea130336aa7Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaCwxNTc0Nzc1MTY5/2.48584140.jpg?w=1280"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Manchester City will seal their spot in the last 16 if they avoid defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk and will be group winners with victory at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p>Shakhtar will progress if they win in Manchester and Dinamo Zagrab lose at Atalanta by virtue of away goals scored in their head-to-head games.</p>
      <p>Atalanta will not qualify if they fail to beat Dinamo or Shakhtar beat City.</p>
      <h3>Group D</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/juventusfcen/status/1198692921547067395" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>Juventus are already through to the knock-out phase and will be group winners with victory at home to Atletico Madrid.</p>
      <p>Atleti will also qualify with a win in Italy but a point will be enough if Bayer Leverkusen and Lokomotiv Moscow draw in Tuesday's early kick-off.</p>
      <p>Should Leverkusen or Lokomotiv win and the Spanish team fail to defeat Juve, the second qualification spot will go to the final matchday on December 11.</p>
      <h3>Group E</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Defending champions Liverpool will qualify as Group E winners if they beat Napoli at home on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Both teams will reach the knock-out phase regardless of the result at Anfield if Salzburg fail to win at Genk.</p>
      <p>Salzburg need to win their last two matches and hope Liverpool fail to pick up a point or Napoli do not win in either fixture.</p>
      <h3>Group F</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/FCBarcelona/status/1198640246696632320" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>Barcelona will progress to the last 16 as group winners with victory over second-placed Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>They will also go through if they draw with Dortmund and the match between Inter Milan and Slavia Prague ends in a stalemate, while they will advance regardless of their result if the Czech outfit defeat Antonio Conte's side.</p>
      <p>Inter cannot qualify if they do not win at Slavia or if Dortmund beat Barca.</p>
      <h3>Group G</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/RBLeipzig_EN/status/1198894261241970689" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>Leaders RB Leipzig will go through if they avoid defeat at home to Benfica and Zenit St Petersburg do not beat Lyon.</p>
      <p>Lyon can seal their path to the knock-out stages with victory at Zenit, but the Russian side will move up to second with three points by virtue of a stronger head-to-head record.</p>
      <p>Benfica have to claim three points in Germany to keep their hopes of a top-two finish alive.</p>
      <h3>Group H</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://image.assets.pressassociation.io/v2/image/production/855553328999131eaff7282887fc78daY29udGVudHNlYXJjaCwxNTc0Nzc1Mjky/2.48045212.jpg?w=1280"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Ajax, Chelsea and Valencia are all locked on seven points at the top of Group H with two matches to go.</p>
      <p>Chelsea will go through if they defeat Valencia in Spain due to their superior head-to-head records against the other two teams.</p>
      <p>Los Che will advance with victory at the Mestalla due to their stronger record against Frank Lampard's side, while Ajax cannot be eliminated regardless of their result against Lille.</p>
