      <p>SHANGHAI: Amazon.com on Monday (Nov 25) said it will open a pop-up store on Chinese e-commerce platform Pinduoduo that will run until the end of December and carry a selection of about 1,000 products from overseas.</p>
      <p>The move, which was <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/amazon-to-open-store-on-china-s-pinduoduo-marketplace-12122018">initially reported by Reuters</a> on Sunday, points to how the US firm's China strategy is evolving after it decided earlier this year to stop operating a marketplace in the country for domestic-selling merchants.</p>

      <p>In April, it said it would instead increase its focus on selling goods from abroad to Chinese buyers and on its other businesses in the country like cloud services.</p>
      <p>Amazon had found it difficult to compete with entrenched, home-grown players such as Alibaba's Tmall and its rival marketplace from JD.com. In a sign of Tmall's dominance, Amazon opened an online store on the platform in 2015.</p>
      <p>Its decision to open a store on Pinduoduo, however, points to how the four-year-old startup has disrupted Alibaba and JD.com's dominance of China's e-commerce market through its popularity with China's rural residents.</p>
      <p>Competition between the three firms have heated up in recent months and Pinduoduo, which woos customers with deep discounts and group-buying deals, suffered a US$11 billion slump in value last week after it posted a much wider-than-expected quarterly loss that stemmed from efforts to fight rivals with heavy subsidies.</p>
      <p>"The Amazon Global Store pop-up store on Pinduoduo provides customers with a curated selection of about 1,000 overseas products with competitive prices, authenticity guarantee and convenient shipping," an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"We look forward to enabling customers to enjoy cross-border shopping through this store, in addition to more deals and tens of millions of products available on z.cn," she said, referring to the website Amazon.cn.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Pinduoduo said that the initiative was part of an aim to "offer equal opportunIties for our users to access global products".</p>
      <p>"We are committed to working with our partners as part of our global outreach to offer best value-for-money products worldwide to our users," she said.</p>
