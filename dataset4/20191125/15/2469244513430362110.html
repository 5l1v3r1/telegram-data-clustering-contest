      <p>A charity supporting the homeless in Devon which faced possible closure is now able to carry on after securing a new base.</p>
      <p>A team of volunteers is helping prepare for the opening of the new headquarters of PATH - People Assisting Torbay’s Homeless.</p>
      <p>The charity is taking out a five-year lease on the former Vanilla Pod restaurant in Union Street, Torquay.</p>
      <p>The move will provide it with a secure base to continue its services and end uncertainty over premises.</p>
      <p>PATH started out as a mobile service to provide food for the homeless, then moved in to a temporary rent-free base at Roebuck House in Abbey Road, near Torquay town centre.</p>
      <p>It had to move out to make way for redevelopment of the block and went to a temporary home provided by Torbay Council nearby.</p>

      <p>It was forced to leave the building in Abbey Road when it was put up for sale this year.</p>
      <p>The charity then moved on a short-term arrangement to Central Church in the town centre.</p>
      <p>It had a deadline to leave the church in November and there were concerns the charity could face closure if it was unable to find a new home.</p>
      <p>Charity founder Kath Friedrich said the church had agreed a small extension and the owners of the new building had helped PATH move in as quickly as possible so its work could continue without a break.</p>

      <p>The former restaurant will house the charity’s services for the homeless or those at risk in poor housing.</p>
      <p>They include a food bank,  food distribution, drop-in advice sessions on housing and employment, meals, showers and clothes-washing.</p>
      <p>The charity supports around 100 people a week.</p>

      <p>Ms Friedrich thanked those who had supported fundraising which had helped pay for the £12,000-a-year lease.</p>
      <p>She said: “I think we are just really, really glad that Torbay people are very good neighbours.”</p>
      <p>PATH is part of the Torbay End Street Homelessness partnership backed by Torbay Council.</p>
      <p>The charity will open at its new premises at 172 Union Street, Torquay, for the first time at 2pm on Thursday, December 28.</p>
