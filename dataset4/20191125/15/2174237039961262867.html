      <h3>Black Friday 2019: when is it?</h3>
      <p>Black Friday has become a bit of a monster, extending far beyond just a single day of retail therapy. This year Black Friday kicks off on Friday 29 November, the day after Thanksgiving, but will continue across the weekend, through to the end of Monday 2 December, known as Cyber Monday. </p>
      <p>But this period, affectionately known as Cyber Weekend, is just the tip of the iceberg. We’re expecting to start seeing deals rolling in from October and extending right through to the new year, making it a great time to find cut-price Christmas prezzies, or treat yourself to a stupidly big 4K TV in readiness for the big Boxing Day movie.</p>
      <h3>Black Friday 2019: what deals can I bag?</h3>
      <p>There’s almost nothing you can’t buy at discounted prices across Cyber Weekend. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><u>Amazon</u></a> and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/"><u>Walmart</u></a> Black Friday sales will be the place to pick up everything from price-dropped <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/amazon-echo-devices-everything-music-fans-need-to-know"><u>Amazon Echo devices</u></a> and Apple iPads, to vinyl, discounted guitars and booze. There might even be some cheeky Black Friday Dr Martens and Converse deals to be had. <a href="https://store.hmv.com/"><u>HMV</u></a> and <a href="https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/index.html"><u>Currys</u></a> should be getting in on the price-slashing action, too.</p>
      <p>For music lovers it’s worth scouting the Black Friday headphones deals before you bite the bullet on a new pair of noise-cancelling cans or wireless in-ear headphones.</p>
      <p>Fancy growing your Funko collection? Rumour has it that this year we’ll see the best Black Friday Funko Pop deals ever.</p>
      <p>Not convinced? You better believe it, buster. Last year, HMV was offering £100 off Beats By Dre Solo 3 wireless headphones, while Bose’s QuietComfort 20 Acoustic in-ear noise cancellers were being sold at half price. Could we see Black Friday Bose or Sony headphones deals to topple these big hitters?</p>
      <h3>Black Friday 2019: how to prepare</h3>
      <p>Not sure where to start? Fail to prepare, prepare to fail is a pretty decent mantra to follow when it comes to Black Friday. It’s all about knowing what you want and where to look. To help you get your wishlist together we'd recommend conducting your research ahead of time.
