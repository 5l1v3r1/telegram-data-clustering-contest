      <p>Samsung Galaxy S11 trio to ship with Laser Auto-Focus<br/>4.5 (90%) 2 votes</p>
      <p>We probably are several months away from knowing the Galaxy S11 in all its glory. However, nothing is stopping them from pipping out through several leaks and rumors. Could be this a sign that Samsung will release its 2020 trio of flagships before the usual MWC season? Well only time will tell, but today, we have another leak about an interesting feature in these devices. According to the very reliable, <a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1198812792226140160">Ice Universe</a>, Samsung will debut a new Laser AutoFocus System in the new Galaxy S11 series.</p>

      <p>Until now, the company has been relying on the Dual Pixel AF system of the image sensor. However, it seems that Samsung will drop this technology in favor of Laser Auto-focus for the upcoming flagships. The reason is unclear, Samsung is rumored to ship a 108MP camera on the upcoming smartphones. Could this sensor lack the Dual Pixel AF system? While Samsung’s ISOCELL Bright HMX lacks this technology, there’s no evidence pointing to the use of this sensor in the future flagships.</p>
      <p>Perhaps, the Laser Auto-Focus system will be there to give all the assistance needed by the other four cameras. Yeah, according to rumors, at least the Galaxy S11+ will ship with a Penta-Camera setup. We have no confirmation about the number of cameras in the standard S11. However, thanks to a couple of <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/23/galaxy-s11e-cad-render-leak-shows-similarity-with-s11/">leaked CAD renders</a> we know that the S11e will have “only” three sensors.</p>
      <p>The actual use of the fifth camera remains a mystery, however, it shouldn’t be for so long. Samsung doesn’t very concerned in keeping its 2020 flagships a secret. All we can say is, here we go again.</p>
