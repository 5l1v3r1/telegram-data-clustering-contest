      <p>According to troopers, Eaton saw a vehicle parked on the shoulder of the exit ramp and tried to steer around it, the newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>"It appears he over-steered, causing him to lose control, strike a signpost and overturning,” state police said in the<a href="https://www.nyspnews.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=69626"> release.</a></p>
      <p>The overcompensation caused the truck to flip, spilling milk onto the highway and snarling traffic for several hours, according to <a href="https://auburnpub.com/news/local/state-police-truck-overturns-spills-gallons-of-milk-on-i/article_3fa5e06e-0f35-11ea-9fe3-bb772ae889eb.html">The Citizen </a>newspaper of Auburn.</p>
      <p>Emergency crews had to cut Eaton out of the tractor-trailer before he could be taken to an area hospital, state police said in its <a href="https://www.nyspnews.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=69626">release.</a> The exit ramp was closed for six hours while crews cleaned up the spilled milk, the <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/crime/2019/11/tractor-trailer-spills-7200-gallons-of-milk-in-i-81-crash-in-oswego-county-driver-taken-to-syracuse-hospital.html">Post-Standard</a> reported.</p>
