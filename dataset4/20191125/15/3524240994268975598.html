      <p>The management of Delta Polytechnic, Ozoro, has banned the use of face caps by students on campus.</p>
      <p>The rector of the polytechnic, Prof. Job Akpodiete, gave this order at the weekend shortly after the burning of more than 5,000 face caps seized from students.</p>
      <p>Akpodiete, represented by the Dean of Student Affairs, Mr. Thomas Ojuye, said the move was to check the incidence of indecent dressing among students on campus.</p>
      <p>“The management of the polytechnic came up with an advice to students to dress in a manner that is acceptable to the institution and the public.</p>
      <p>“Sequel to the directive by the school management, the use of all manner of caps by students on campus has been proscribed,” he said.</p>
      <p>The rector said that the polytechnic’s security unit had been authorised as a matter of importance to destroy seized caps henceforth.</p>

      <p>The polytechnic, he said, had, over the years, witnessed relative peace and cult-free academic environment.</p>
      <p>Akpodiete described the feat as a product of conscientious and proactive measures put in place by the management of the institution.</p>
      <p>In his remark, the polytechnic’s Chief Security Officer, Mr. Simeon Eduke, described Ozoro Polytechnic as one of the most peaceful institutions in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>He said the destruction of the seized face caps was to serve as a deterrence to incoming students of the polytechnic.</p>
