      <p>A drive to encourage under 25s to register to vote is being boosted - by the offer of free pizza.</p>
      <p>The Circle Eatery, which has restaurants in Beeston and Bingham, came up with the initiative to encourage the younger generation to sign up so they can vote in the General Election on December 12.</p>
      <p>Anyone who has registered can bag themselves a freebie tomorrow, Tuesday November 26.</p>
      <p>"Registration for under 25s is very low. To encourage more participation, on Tuesday the 26th were giving away FREE PIZZA to all under 25s who have registered to vote," says owner Javid Omoomian, who runs eateries in High Road, Beeston, and Market Street, Bingham.</p>
      <p>To qualify for any free pizza (except the Fancy Pants) book in advance and take along your polling card. The offer is only available when eating in.</p>
      <p>Time is running out to register. The deadline is Tuesday November 26 at 11.59pm.</p>
