      <p>A new crossing is set to be installed in an East Devon village as part of further plans to slow down traffic.</p>
      <p>The East Devon Highways and Traffic Orders Committee on Friday (November 22) has approved the construction of a new signalised crossing on Honiton Road in at Blackhorse Village, just outside of Exeter.</p>
      <p>As well as helping Devon County Council and East Devon District Council’s ambition to progress the Clyst Valley Way, councillors heard it would help reduce speeds of vehicles on the westbound approach or leaving the village.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, residents of Blackhorse Village complained of vehicles ignoring the speed limit, and at the end of 2018, councillors on the same committee agreed that the roundabout arm to Clyst Honiton which closed off with concrete barriers should see the closure made permanent.</p>

      <p>Dave Black, Head of Planning, Transportation and Environment, in his report to the meeting, said that the toucan crossing should help reduce the speeds of traffic.</p>
      <p>He said: “There have been historic concerns raised by residents of Blackhorse about the volume and speed of traffic passing on Honiton Road accessing new developments including Cranbrook and the Lidl Regional Distribution Centre. This crossing facility will help create a gateway feature at the eastern end of the village, helping reduce speeds of vehicles on the westbound approach or leaving the village.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/quiet-devon-village-just-300-2803163">Speaking to DevonLive earlier this year</a> , one resident who has lived in Clyst Honiton for a decade says the amount of traffic that passes through the village has risen from 2,000 vehicles a day to more than 8,000.</p>
      <p>He said: “Ever since Cranbrook and the Lidl depot was built, traffic has now increased, and people constantly go through red lights. People are constantly speeding.”</p>
      <p>The resident lives on the main road of the village, and says he is always woken up in the middle of the night by the lorries.</p>
      <p>They had called for speed restrictions or speed cameras to be placed on the roads at Honiton Road and York Terrace.</p>
      <p>The current speed limit here is 40mph, but residents say traffic goes past far quicker.</p>

      <p>Carol Griffiths, landlady of the Black Horse Inn, added: ""The car side of things is not too bad, it’s the lorries. The area desperately needs a speed camera, the speed they go past. “There has definitely been an increase in lorries. That has increased massively.</p>
      <p>“I know they’ve got a job to do but they’re not always within speed limits. I hate speed cameras, but if ever there should be one it should be there.”</p>
      <p>Cllr Ray Bloxham had also called on changes to the way traffic is managed in the area, with suggestions including reducing the speed limit to 30mph, and putting weight restrictions for vehicles, saying: We successfully closed a rat run on Clyst Honiton which took some time to do. The focus is now on Black Horse and the through road.”</p>

      <p>The report of Mr Black to last Friday's meeting on the new Toucan crossing added that while there may not currently be high volumes of pedestrians and cyclists travelling in the Sowton village direction at present, the crossing would improve access to and from the local bus stop, providing access for Blackhorse residents travelling to Exeter or to jobs at SkyPark/Exeter Airport and for people travelling to the Blackhorse pub and Women’s Institute Offices.</p>
      <p>He added: “The crossing will be a small element of the overall Clyst Valley Way route, and will ultimately allow path users to travel between Broadclyst, Clyst Honiton and Sowton village. The crossing would also form a junction point with the Exeter Strategic Cycle Route E4 between Cranbrook and Exeter City Centre.”</p>
