      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:43:44+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/barry-roche-7.1837426" target="_blank">Barry Roche</a></address>
      <p>A 63-year-old man has been given a 12 month suspended sentence for careless driving causing the death of his friend on condition that he leaves Ireland within 24 hours.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Pavelaka+Galba">Pavelaka Galba</a> from the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Czech+Republic">Czech Republic</a> had pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention and causing the death of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Miroslav+Kozel">Miroslav Kozel</a> (59) at Ballybeg West, Buttevant, Co Cork on November 24th, 2014.</p>
      <p>At Cork Circuit <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Criminal+Court">Criminal Court</a>, Sgt Tony Cronin told how Galba was driving around near Ballybeg quarry when he lost control of the car and it careered out of control.</p>
      <p>The car collided with an oncoming car and Mr Kozel was killed.</p>
      <p>Galba was arrested following his discharge from hospital five days late.</p>
      <p>The court heard had been charged some time later but failed to show up in court in 2016. Gardaí later obtained a European Arrest Warrant for his extradition back to Ireland from the Czech Republic.</p>
      <p>Sgt Cronin said that Galba had been in custody since his extradition in July 2019.</p>
      <p>He agreed with defence barrister, Sinead Behan BL, that her client was now seriously ill with Parkinson’s Disease.</p>
      <p>Judge Seán Ó Donnabháin said the fact that Galba had driven without insurance on the day in question and had left the jurisdiction after he been charged were all aggravating factors.</p>
      <p>However, the judge said overriding such aggravating factors was Galba’s deteriorating health and in those circumstances the most appropriate place for him was not prison but at home with his family.</p>
      <p>He said that taking all factors into account, he believed the appropriate sentence was a 12 month term which he would suspend on condition that Galba would leave Ireland within 24 hours of his release on bail.</p>
      <p>He also made it a condition of the suspension that Galba would not return to Ireland for a period of three years . He also disqualified him from driving in Ireland for a period of 10 years.</p>
