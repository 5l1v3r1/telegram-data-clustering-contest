      <h2>The Reds host Napoli in the Champions League at Anfield on Wednesday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:26:18+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/aidan-mccartney/" target="_blank">Aidan McCartney</a></address>
      <p>Napoli have been handed an injury blow ahead of the Champions League tie with Napoli after striker Lorenzo Insigne was ruled of the game.</p>
      <p>Insigne won't travel to England for the game and has been left out of the squad after picking up an elbow injury.</p>
      <p>The Italian forward has scored five times in his 17 appearances for Napoli this season and netted against the Reds in the Champions League last season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> can seal their place in the Champions League last-16 with victory over the Serie A side despite losing to Napoli 2-0 in September.</p>
      <p>Napoli are currently seventh in Serie A and have gone five matches without a win amid reports of a bust-up amid players and president Aurelio De Laurentiis.</p>
      <p>The club's owner has threatened to sell the entire squad after a dressing room revolt.</p>
      <p>A 1-1 draw at home to Red Bull Salzburg last time out in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool's</a> group prompted chairman Aurelio De Laurentiis to organise a training camp.</p>
      <p>However, in an act of mutiny, Napoli's players refused to report to the extra session which led to a furious stand-off between the playing staff and Laurentiis is now considering cutting his losses and letting some of his star players leave in the January window.</p>
      <p><b>Napoli squad to face Liverpool: </b> Meret, Karnezis, Ospina; Di Lorenzo, Koulibaly, Mario Rui, Luperto, Manolas, Maksimovic, Hysaj; Allan, Elmas, Fabian, Gaetano, Zielinski; Llorente, Callejon, Mertens, Younes, Lozano</p>
