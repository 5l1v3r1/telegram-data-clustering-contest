      <p>Urvashi Rautela had made an elaborate plan to take along a gang of 48 people to watch her recent release Pagalpanti in cinema hall. But, it didn’t materialise. <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/pagalpanti-underperforms-at-the-box-office-film-s-actress-urvashi-rautela-blissfully-blocks-48-tickets-for-her-friends-in-lucknow-to-see-it-with-them-exclusive/5dd947090cada251e9c311c1">We had exclusively revealed to you that the actress had blocked 48 tickets in Lucknow </a>to see the film along with her friends.</p>
      <p>The excitement was at its peak for Urvashi and the actress had planned to first head out for a dinner followed by a late night show of Pagalpanti. But aisa kya hua that she had to sacrifice her movie night? So basically, Urvashi who has been shooting for a South remake in Lucknow was expecting to wrap up the day’s shoot and quickly troop off. But, the shoot got extended a bit too much and went on till 9.30pm.</p>

      <p>That left the actress with no option but to cancel the programme. Now when Urvashi can’t make it, how could her friends go to see the film? So, eventually blocking 48 good tickets didn’t help the actress. Now, if the distributor Anand Pandit or producer T-Series had arranged those tickets for the actress, we wonder if the tickets were sold off to common public and the 48 seats didn’t remain vacant.</p>

      <p>Well, speaking of the Anees Bazmee directorial, it didn’t register good box-office business in the first weekend visavis its cost, plus the reviews too haven’t been favourable.
