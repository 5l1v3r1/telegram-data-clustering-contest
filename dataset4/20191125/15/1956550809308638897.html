      <p>Dubai's JBR has revealed its <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/christmas">Christmas</a> line-up for December's WOWJBR and it even includes an ice skating rink.<br/><br/>It may be cooling down, but not enough for an ice skating rink, surely? Well, actually yes – for the first time ever JBR will be getting its very own ice skating rink right by the beach.<br/><br/>Throughout <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/gallery/423548-christmas-in-dubai-2019-catch-a-christmas-theatre-performance-in-dubai">December</a> JBR will be home to a (synthetic) ice skating rink, complete with a giant igloo where skaters can get ready to hit the ice, as well as a winter forest – all marvelously Instagrammable.<br/><br/>But that's just one of the activities little ones can enjoy with their families.<br/><br/>In addition, look out for the various <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/christmas">Christmas</a> characters who will be roaming around ready for an impromptu selfie opportunity.<br/><br/>Kids will love clapping eyes on the Christmas-stealing Grinch, <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/kids/423324-christmas-2019-where-the-kids-can-meet-father-christmas-in-dubai">Santa</a> and his elves as well as the robbers from the Home Alone films.<br/><br/>Try your luck on the human claw. Get strapped in and then dangle over a pit of pressies as you try your best to grab a gift – definitely much easier than it looks.<br/><br/>Other cool activities include a giant Rubik's cube that will test your puzzle-solving skills.<br/><br/>Get your skates on this <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/christmas">Christmas in Dubai</a>.<br/><i>Free. Thu Dec 5- Fri Dec 27, Fri &amp; Sat, from 6.30pm. JBR, The Walk.</i></p>
