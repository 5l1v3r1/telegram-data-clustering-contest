      <p>The sister of former Premier League footballer Jlloyd Samuel has accused his wife of faking his death as part of an insurance scam.</p>
      <p>Samuel, who played in the English top-flight with Aston Villa and Bolton, tragically died in May 2018 after his £100,000 Range Rover was involved in a collision with a van in Cheshire.</p>
      <p>But his family believe the tragic footballer is still alive and will raise their concerns at a two-day hearing into his death, which is due to get underway on Tuesday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10410632/jlloyd-samuel-death-faked-family-claim/">The Sun</a> has claimed that Samuel's sister Leslie-Ann Samuel, 39, and his parents have complained that the coroner and Cheshire Police have thus far denied them access to carry out their own DNA tests on remains found in the incinerated car.</p>

      <p>They believe that Samuel, who was dropping his children off at school when the tragic accident happened, was not behind the wheel of his Range Rover.</p>
      <p>The Sun goes on to claim that the former defender's family believe that his wife 'faked' his death in the car crash to cash in on an insurance fraud.</p>
      <p>It is unclear if she feels her brother is part of the alleged scheme, although she has previously posted on social media claiming she knows her sibling is still alive.</p>
      <p>Leslie-Ann also posted a picture on social media of a letter from the coroner’s office explaining the identification process.</p>
      <p>The letter does state, however, that solicitors representing Samuel's wife, Emma, had given the wider family permission to conduct DNA testing.</p>

      <p>Samuel's sister has posted a series of on social media since his death.</p>
      <p>She said: “Jlloyd we WILL see you soon, in this life.”</p>
      <p>“Jlloyd brother we know you are ALIVE and well and we know the DNA the pathologist have is not your DNA .. 100%... Lies…”</p>
      <p>A Cheshire Police spokesman confirmed they had received a complaint from his family over the investigation into his death.</p>

      <p>The spokesman said: “Her complaint was investigated thoroughly by senior officers who ruled that the investigation into Mr Samuel’s death was proportionate, timely and of the standard required.</p>
      <p>“These conclusions were verified in a peer review by an independent police force. As such, the complaint was not upheld.</p>
      <p>“The family member has been informed of this and of the conclusions reached following the investigation into her complaint.</p>
      <p>“She was given a 28-day period in which they could appeal the decision, but no appeal was received.”</p>
