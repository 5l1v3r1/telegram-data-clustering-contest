      <p>Tunde Olatunji, the Chief Whip of Osun House of Assembly, says his passion for functional education and commitment toward making learning attractive to students are factors responsible for his taking up voluntary teaching in <a href="http://concisenews.global/education">public schools</a> in the state.</p>
      <p>Concise News reports that Olatunji (APC-Ife North) spoke on Monday while teaching Junior Secondary School students at C&amp;S Government Middle School, Ipetumodu, under his programme tagged, “Tunde Goes To School,’’ on Monday.</p>
      <p>The lawmaker said voluntary teaching of students in public schools in the state was an effort on his part to drive quality and functional education by imparting knowledge and skills that would make the students to be useful to the society.</p>
      <p>Olatunji said his choice of mathematics as a subject to be taught was deliberate with the aim of stimulating the interest of youths “in this all-important subject often tagged as difficult.”</p>
      <p>He said Civic Education, which was his second choice of subject, would impact on the students a sense of national duty, obligation, patriotism, respect for human rights and ethics.</p>

      <p>“I have been privileged to have personal encounters and rub minds with well over 3,500 students in our secondary schools in the state since the beginning of this academic term about two months ago.</p>
      <p>“My experience in all the schools is similar and the common denominator is that our dear State of Osun and by extension, Nigeria, is indeed blessed with youthful talents and human capital remains our greatest asset,” Olatunji said.</p>
      <p>The lawmaker said his other educational programmes to assist many young talents in academics and sports across Osun State in the last four years had started yielding results.</p>
      <h3>PTA donates education materials to 94 public schools in Kwara</h3>
      <p>In related news, the Parents Teachers Association (PTA) in Irepodun Local Government Area of Kwara, has donated some education and Instructional materials to 94 public secondary schools in the council, towards improving teaching and learning.</p>
      <p>Alhaji Issa Abdulsalam (aka 10-10), the council’s PTA Chairman, while handing over the materials to the principals of the schools, in Omu-Aran, on Sunday, urged them to remain committed, prudent and efficient.</p>
      <p>Issa said the donation, comprising of 140 packs of chalks and 140 packs of biro, was the first of its kind by any association in the council area.</p>
      <p>He said the donation, apart from being part of the association’s corporate social responsibility, was equally meant to reciprocate the schools’ financial commitment to the association in the efforts to improve teaching and learning.</p>
      <p>“It’s a known fact that goverment alone cannot provide all our basic necessities, hence the need for public and private partnership to achieve the desired results.</p>
      <p>“It’s part of our responsibility as an association and a stakeholder in the education sector to promote a good learning and teaching environment for both the teachers and the students to dwell.</p>
      <p>“Education is the best legacy a nation can bequeath on it’s citizenry and no education is valid without the require solid foundation and conducive leaning and teaching environment.</p>
      <p>“This is why we took the bull by the horn and decided to donate this token to complement the goverment’s efforts in the sector.</p>
      <p>“We are very optimistic that you will remain committed and dedicated as always in uplifting the standard of the education of our children to an enviable height,” he said.</p>
      <p>Bidemi Olawuyi, the Council’s PTA Secretary, in his contribution, peaised the leadership of the All Nigeria Conference of Principals of Secondary Schools (ANCOPSS) in the council area for it’s commitment and proactiveness.</p>
      <p>He urged the defaulting schools as regard payment of dues to the association to brace up and settle their indebtedness without further delay.</p>
      <p>Olawuyi, a former Principal of Omu-Aran High School, said only a collective responsibility of stakeholders could assist to achieve the desired development in the sector, especially at the grassroots.</p>
      <p>Raphael Adeoti, Principal, Ofe-Aran Commercial College, Omu-Aran, who spoke on behalf of the beneficiaries, thanked the association for it’s foresight and magnanimity.</p>
      <p>He promised that the materials would be judiciously utilised for the purpose it was intended.</p>
      <p>The break-down of the distribution showed 60 schools from Ajase/Oro Zone and 34 schools from Omu-Aran Zone benefitted from the donation.</p>
