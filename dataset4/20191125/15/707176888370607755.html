      <h2>Initiative aimed at funding public projects ends up financing property</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:06:26+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:06</time> by <a rel="author">Hudson Lockett, Sun Yu</a></address>
      <p>A high-profile initiative to fire up funding for Chinese infrastructure has fallen short of meeting regions’ needs and ended up diverting some cash into the real estate sector instead of the public projects it is intended to support, analysis by the Financial Times shows.</p>
      <p>Beijing ordered a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8e3e2dae-ba58-11e8-94b2-17176fbf93f5">big increase</a> in the issuance of so-called special-purpose bonds in late 2018, touting them as a way to fund specific projects including irrigation, transport and toll roads. This boost has helped the market to swell to $1.3tn in five years, government data show, pulling a sizeable chunk of local financing out of the shadows.</p>
      <p>But a particularly flexible slice of these bonds that can be paid off using projects’ revenues has flowed largely into real estate projects. In total, 90 per cent of this slice has ended up in the sector — an injection worth more than $370bn.</p>
      <p>Alarmed by how much of these funds are ending up in land banks or slum redevelopment projects, regulators want to put a stop to such property plays, placing a moratorium on the practice in September. But some local officials are sceptical a clampdown is really working while Beijing faces pressure to provide more financing as a buffer against slowing economic growth.</p>
      <p>“All we need now is to fill out a few forms and within a few weeks the National Development and Reform Commission will give us the green light,” said one official from a local government financing entity in Jiangxi province in eastern China.</p>
      <p>Authorities in Beijing now spend little time scrutinising SPB applications, he said, warning that this could lead to risky behaviour from local governments “cooking their books to qualify for an SPB” by, for example, exaggerating a project’s expected income.</p>
      <p>SPBs were pitched as a transparent way to fund grand infrastructure plans, putting an end to off-balance sheet borrowing for China’s local governments. But some of the bonds threaten to force local governments to pay off debt using fiscal revenues if their projects fail to pay for themselves. And despite blistering growth, SPBs are still able to cover only a fraction of Chinese local governments’ total financing needs.</p>
      <p>Policymakers have faced a challenge in boosting financing while the country’s economic growth slows. Annual gross domestic product growth is running at 6 per cent, its <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/396e67be-f0b5-11e9-ad1e-4367d8281195">slowest pace</a> in about 30 years. Earlier this month, China’s central bank trimmed its <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7a6320c8-09e9-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">short-term</a> lending rate for the first time in four years, the latest in a series of targeted easing measures.</p>

      <p>Beijing launched special-purpose bonds four years ago to allow local governments to raise capital for long-term expenditure. Policymakers hoped they would serve as a more transparent alternative for funding infrastructure investment to general-purpose local-government financing vehicles, or LGFVs. These instruments issue debt that does not appear on governments’ balance sheets and is therefore <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/adabd0ae-d0f3-11e8-a9f2-7574db66bcd5">hard to track</a>, with credit rating agency S&amp;P Global warning of a “debt iceberg” in a report last year.</p>
      <p>Issuance of the new bonds was lacklustre until 2017, when Beijing tightened regulation of the LGFVs, boosted quotas for the new special-purpose bonds and introduced a “project-based” version of SPBs that could be repaid using revenues generated by the projects they fund. This year, all types of special-purpose bonds have accounted for 60 per cent of local government issuance, according to finance ministry figures. Last year, the majority was general-purpose debt.</p>
      <p>Another key goal for SPBs is to spur funding of public works, but officials say most such projects are more likely to incur expenses from regular maintenance than to generate any revenue.</p>
      <p>One official at an LGFV in Shanxi province — where the local government plans to issue an SPB — said because so few projects actually generated any income, many local governments instead plan to pay off the bonds with tax revenues. “That violates the basic principle of special purpose bonds,” the official said.</p>
      <p>Rosealea Yao, property analyst at research group Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing, said funding from SPBs may have been why fixed-asset investment in slum-redevelopment projects had barely slowed. “[If this] funding gets cut in 2020, real estate investment should be impacted,” she said.</p>

      <p>In September, Beijing assigned quotas for next year’s SPBs, three months ahead of schedule. To Ms Yao, that is a sign that policymakers are under pressure to get funding and projects ready in order to prop up growth.</p>
      <p>Local officials say these quotas still are not enough to allow the new bonds to fully replace shadow financing. The LGFV official from Shanxi noted midsized cities’ SPB allocations could be as little as Rmb10bn. “That's like a drop in the bucket given that total fixed-asset investment could easily exceed Rmb100bn in a city,” he said.</p>
      <p>Yubin Fu, a Moody’s analyst who tracks local government debt, said SPBs had succeeded in bringing more of local governments’ liabilities back on to the books after years of reliance on shadow lending.</p>
      <p>But while an acceleration of SPB issuance has helped make up some of the funding shortfall faced by many local governments, she said, it will not soon eliminate them. “As long as the funding gap is still there, they will still need LGFVs.”</p>
