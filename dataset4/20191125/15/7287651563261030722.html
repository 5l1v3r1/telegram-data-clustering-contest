      <p><pic src="https://www.guru3d.com/news_teaserimage/14744"/>G.SKILL is excited to announce a series of high performance quad channel memory kits for the latest Intel X299 and AMD TRX40 high-end desktop (HEDT) platforms.</p>
      <p>The kits include the high-capacity DDR4-3600 CL16-19-19-39 256GB (32GBx8), DDR4-4000 CL18-22-22-42 256GB (32GBx8), and the high-speed, low-latency DDR4-4000 CL15-16-16-36 64GB (8GBx8) specifications. By bringing ultra-high 32GB memory module capacity into the realm of HEDT computing, powerful workstations are now truly able to achieve a complete combination of high core count processor with high-speed, high-capacity memory for heavy workloads or for running more virtual machines than ever.</p>
      <p>Full Power of the Intel X299 Platform<br/>Built for the ultimate memory performance, the G.SKILL is releasing the DDR4-4000 CL15-16-16-36 64GB (8GBx8) memory specification that combines both extremely high speed and ultra-low latency in a high capacity 64GB memory kit. As seen validated on the new Intel® Core™ i9-10900X processor on the ASUS ROG RAMPAGE VI EXTREME ENCORE and MSI Creator X299 motherboards in the screenshots below, this supremely fast memory kit is the ideal choice for high-performance workstations:</p>
      <p>For ultra-high capacity memory kits, built with the latest high-density 32GB modules, the DDR4-4000 CL18-22-22-42 256GB (32GBx8) is the perfect choice for memory hungry applications, like running multiple virtual machines. In the screenshot below, this behemoth memory kit is seen validated with Intel® Core™ i9-9920X and i9-9820X processors with the MSI Creator X299 and ASUS PRIME X299-DELUXE II motherboards, respectively.</p>
      <p>Pushing the Limits of the AMD TRX40 Platform<br/>Built for use with the latest 3rd Gen AMD Ryzen Threadripper processors and optimized for squeezing out every last ounce of performance, G.SKILL has integrated low latency specifications of DDR4-3600 CL14-15-15-35 into a 64GB (8GBx8) Trident Z Neo memory kit. In the following screenshot, this highly efficient memory kit is validated with the latest AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3960X processor and the ASUS ROG Zenith II Extreme motherboard.</p>
      <p>G.SKILL is also launching an ultra-high capacity memory kit based on high-density 32GB memory modules for the AMD platform, with the DDR4-3600 CL16-19-19-39 256GB (32GBx8) specification. This extreme capacity memory kit is also validated with the AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3960X processor and the ASUS ROG Zenith II Extreme motherboard in the screenshot below.</p>
