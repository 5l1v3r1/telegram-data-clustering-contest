      <h2>Jacob was horrible to Leanna after they slept together</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:16:39+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:16</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Rodrigues</a></address>
      <p>It looks as though <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-jacob-gallagher/">Jacob Gallagher</a> has seen the error of his ways as he tries to make things right with Leanna Cavanagh in tonight's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a> (November 25).</p>
      <p>Last week, viewers saw a vicious side to the teen as he pushed everyone too far.</p>
      <p>After Jacob's abuser <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-maya-stepney/">Maya Stepney</a> was released from prison, Jacob was heartbroken she was ignoring him and the teenager ended up sleeping with her former stepdaughter Leanna.</p>
      <p>But afterwards, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-viewers-disgusted-with-jacob-gallaghers-treatment-of-leanna/">Jacob was cruel to Leanna</a> and in front of her family claimed he only slept with her because she came looking for him.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Hearing Jacob disrespect his daughter, Liam punched him in the face, leading Jacob to go to the police and get the doctor arrested for assault.</p>
      <p>But Jacob got a reality check when <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-spoilers-david-metcalfe-throws-jacob-gallagher-out/">his family told him they were kicking him out</a> as they no longer knew what to do with him.</p>
      <p>Although it was an empty threat, it made Jacob realise Maya had ruined his life and that he needed to make things right with the people he hurt.</p>

      <p>Having repaired his relationship with his family, next on his list is to fix things with Liam and Leanna.</p>
      <p>Jacob tells the police he no longer wants to press charges against Liam, saving his medical career.</p>
      <p>Shortly afterwards, he makes a heartfelt apology to Leanna for the way he treated her. But will she accept his apology?</p>
      <p>Viewers know Jacob was abused by his schoolteacher and dad <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-david-metcalfe/">David's</a> girlfriend Maya.</p>
      <p>Maya <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-disturbed-maya-grooms-jacob-secret-kiss/">began grooming Jacob from the age of 15</a> and had the schoolboy believing they were in a loving relationship.</p>

      <p>She even began sleeping with Jacob shortly after his 16th birthday.</p>
      <p>The predator was caught out earlier this year and was eventually<a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-predict-maya-stepney-will-be-back-for-revenge-in-explosive-christmas-storyline/"> sentenced to 12 months in prison</a>, but ended up only serving five.</p>
      <p>As she was released from the jail, viewers saw her delete Jacob's contact from her phone before the camera <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-viewers-stunned-as-maya-returns-pregnant/">revealed she is pregnant</a>!</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/six-best-theories-over-what-will-happen-next-in-maya-stepney-plot/">who's the father of her unborn child</a>?</p>
