      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The daughter of a woman killed in a 2012 mass shooting will not be able to sue the operator of a firearms classified advertising website from which the killer illegally bought his gun after the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear her appeal.</p>
      <p>The justices left in place an April ruling by the Wisconsin Supreme Court that found that a federal law that shields website operators from liability for user content applied to Armslist LLC, the operator of Armslist.com.</p>
      <p>Armslist is an Oklahoma-based website that allows users to post classified advertisements for firearms and related equipment. Potential buyers contact sellers directly.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit, including several claims under Wisconsin law such as negligence and wrongful death, stemmed from a 2012 shooting at a beauty salon in Brookfield, Wisconsin. Gunman Radcliffe Haughton killed his wife, Zina Daniel, and two of her co-workers there before taking his own life. Four other people were injured in the shooting.</p>
