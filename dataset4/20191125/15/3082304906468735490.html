        <b>According to the latest reports, Manchester United star Paul Pogba is keen to join Real Madrid at the earliest, and he may he even “push” for a move to the Santiago Bernabeu in January.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7722609/Paul-Pogba-pushing-Real-Madrid-January.html"><i>Daily Mail</i></a> claims that Pogba wants to move to Real Madrid during the upcoming January transfer window – and Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer also appears ready to let him leave.</p>
      <p>Pogba, who was a prime target for <i>Los Blancos </i>manager Zinedine Zidane last summer – is also reportedly refusing to return to the first-team at Manchester United, also having asked for more time to fully recover from the foot injury that has kept him on the sidelined since 2019 September.</p>
      <p>And it is the Spanish outlet <i><a href="https://www.cope.es/deportes/futbol/amp/noticias/vestuario-del-united-afirman-que-pogba-juega-para-poder-irse-madrid-invierno-20191124_558749?__twitter_impression=true">Cope</a> </i>who now reports that the Manchester United midfielder could be on the move to the Santiago Bernabeu as early as January.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Solskjaer himself is apparently not anticipating a high-spending transfer window in January, aside from a couple of possible loan deals.</p>
      <p>“It is not about ‘x’ amount of money [we have to spend], it is about who do we think will be good for the club in the long-term, not just three or four months,” he said in a recent interview, before adding:</p>
      <p>“Not many clubs want to sell players that they would otherwise want to keep in January. Maybe one or two could be a loan deal but that is not a big money thing, it is just to help the team.”</p>
      <p>“But we are getting players back and we are looking at what can be available for us.”</p>
