      <p>The Flash of Earth-90 has returned, and he's bringing Black Lightning with him.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.cbr.com/crisis-infinite-earths-photos-lex-luthor-waverider/">new photos</a> from <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths/">"Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part 3,"</a> Flash and Black Lightning can be seen clasping each other's arms in a firm handshake. It appears Barry Allen may have a part to play in convincing Jefferson Pierce to join them on their mission to save the multiverse from the Anti-Monitor.</p>

      <p>Earth-90's Flash, as played by John Wesley Shipp from 1990's short-lived <i>Flash</i> series, appeared in last year's crossover "Elseworlds." He warned the heroes of the main <i>Arrow</i>verse about the Monitor. When he confronted the Monitor, the god-like being transported him away and he was never seen again -- until now.</p>

      <p>Black Lightning, on the other hand, currently stars in his own series on The CW. However, he exists in a world separate from the <i>Arrow</i>verse, so he is not familiar with Flash, Green Arrow, Supergirl or the Legends. As the photos show, he will ultimately join their cause for "Crisis on Infinite Earths."</p>
      <p>According to The CW's official synopsis for "Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Three,"</p>
      <blockquote>BLACK LIGHTNING JOINS THE ARROWVERSE IN THE THIRD CHAPTER OF THE CROSSOVER – Pariah (Tom Cavanagh) enlists Black Lightning (guest star Cress Williams) to help stop the Anti-Monitor (guest star LaMonica Garrett) after Flash-90 (guest star John Wesley Shipp) shares what he learned from his battle in ‘Elseworlds.’ With the help of Black Lightning, Barry (Grant Gustin), Cisco (Carlos Valdes) and Killer Frost (Danielle Panabaker) come up with a plan that could save them all. Meanwhile, Iris (Candice Patton) has a heart-to-heart with Ryan Choi (guest star Osric Chau), while Oliver (guest star Stephen Amell) and Diggle (guest star David Ramsey) return to an old familiar stomping ground. David McWhirter directed the episode with story by Eric Wallace and teleplay by Lauren Certo &amp; Sterling Gates (#609). Original airdate 12/10/2019.</blockquote>
      <p>"Crisis on Infinite Earths" begins Sunday, Dec. 8 on <i>Supergirl</i>, then continues in <i>Batwoman</i> on Monday, Dec. 9, and then picks up in <i>The Flash</i> on Tuesday, Dec. 10. After a winter hiatus, the crossover concludes on Tuesday, Jan. 14 on both <i>Arrow</i> and <i>DC's Legends of Tomorrow</i>.</p>
