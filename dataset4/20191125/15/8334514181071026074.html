      <h1>CymaBay Therapeutics scraps two studies of liver drug; shares plunge</h1>

      <p>(Reuters) - CymaBay Therapeutics Inc said on Monday it was scrapping two mid-stage trials of its liver disease drug, after biopsies found a type of liver damage in some patients, sending its shares down over 75%.</p>
      <p>The drug developer said it had observed “atypical” findings from the first set of liver biopsies, including autoimmune hepatitis, in one mid-stage trial that was testing the drug in patients with a fatty liver disease known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).</p>
      <p>The findings were observed in patients who had shown an improvement in their condition during the trial, or had shown signs of disease stabilization.</p>
      <p>The drug developer said it will terminate the NASH study as well as another mid-stage study testing the drug in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, while it would also halt a late-stage study of the drug in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), an autoimmune liver disorder.</p>
      <p>The company said it had started a series of investigations to better understand the biopsy results.</p>
      <p>“Given the seriousness of what they’ve found, I believe it is now an open question whether the company can recover from this,” said Ed Arce, an analyst with HC Wainwright.</p>
      <p>The announcement comes after the failure of Gilead Sciences Inc’s NASH treatment in a mid-stage study, and a separate trial failure of rival Conatus Pharmaceutical Inc’s experimental NASH drug earlier this year.</p>
      <p>“A lot of information at this moment is missing to really conclude that it’s drug induced or not drug induced,” Roth Capital Markets analyst Yasmeen Rahimi said.</p>
      <p>She added that the main focus of the company has been on treating PBC and NASH has not been on their radar as much, given the competitive landscape.</p>
      <p>“...if they would have said we’re just halting NASH and continuing PBC, the stock wouldn’t have taken a hit. When they’re basically halting all clinical programs, it is really making people uncertain,” Rahimi added.</p>
      <p>Successful treatments for NASH have remained elusive, but the market remains lucrative with the potential to reach as much as $20 billion by 2030, as people with fatty diets increasingly develop the disease.</p>
      <p>CymaBay shares tumbled 76.1% to a three-year low of $1.32 in early trading on Monday.</p>
