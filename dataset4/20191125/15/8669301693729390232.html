      <h1>‘Give them some time’: Dutch Grandmaster Anish Giri feels India’s youngsters can succeed Anand</h1>

      <p>Dutch Grandmaster Anish Giri on Monday said India have a talented bunch of youngsters who need time to bridge the gap with the legendary Viswanathan Anand. The five-time world champion, who will turn 50 next month, continues to remain the best bet among the Indians with a world ranking of 11.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think there’s a big gap. Harikrishna is very strong, while Vidit Gujrathi is also a top player,” Anish said on the sidelines of Tata Chess 2019 in the Grand Chess Tour. “The young generation of talents are just 13-14 years-old, and are too young to make a breakthrough. I think you just need to give them some time,” he said, referring to the two youngsters, R Praggnanandhaa and Nihal Sarin.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old halted the Magnus Carlsen express, holding the reigning world champion with Herculean defensive technique in round two of the Blitz on Monday.</p>
      <p>Terming it an ordinary and dull show, he said: “I did not prepare much for the blitz. I just played something I already knew. It was not a highlight or low light. It was an ordinary game. There were many more games that I was on the lucky side or on the unlucky side. It was a pretty dull game actually.”</p>
      <p>Anish, who won the Shenzhen Masters this year, said he’s keen on putting a good show at the 2020 Candidates in Yekaterinburg, Russia from March 15 to April 5.</p>
      <p>“Right now, I am not completely thinking about anything. I’m thrilled to make it to Candidates. I have a lot of plans and have to work very hard. If things go my way there are some hopes,” he said.</p>
