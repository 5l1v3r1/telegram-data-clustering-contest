      <h1>Jeremy Clarkson Says Climate Change is Real Now</h1>

      <p>Anyone who has paid any small amount of attention to Jeremy Clarkson knows a few basic things about him: he likes cars, and he doesn't believe human beings cause climate change. Well, I should correct you on that last one. No doubt Clarkson still likes cars (still barring the electric variety, I assume), but it seems he's changed his mind about the whole climate change topic.</p>
      <p>In the past Clarkson has been very against the idea of climate change being a thing, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/jul/10/climate-change-science-fiction-jeremy-clarkson">dismissing it as 'science fiction' </a>and once suggesting that global warming was <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2016/11/clarkson-hammond-and-may-on-drivetribe-the-new-social-network-for-motoring-enthusiasts/">a term made up by Margaret Thatcher to help her fight the striking miners.</a> He even made the news recently for using <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10022396/greta-thunberg-meltdown-wont-help-world/">his Sun column</a> to attack climate activist Greta Thunberg - calling her a spoiled brat and suggesting she go back to school.</p>
      <p>But now, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/and-on-that-bombshell-jeremy-clarkson-is-a-climate-change-believer-rgdfnfnss">while speaking to the Sunday Times</a>, Clarkson says he's all in on it, after seeing the effects climate change has had for himself. Specifically a "graphic demonstration of global warming" while boating through Cambodia for <i>The Grand Tour</i>.</p>
      <blockquote>“The irony is not lost on me. A man who hosted a car programme for 30 years, limited to 7mph by global warming.<br/><br/>It’s the first time that we’ve ever admitted to there being global warming. We were completely screwed on that [trip].<br/><br/>There was no water in the Tonle Sap lake. I mean, it was knee-deep. And you could paddle in it. So we had two days of absolute frustration — being towed and grounding.”</blockquote>
      <p>He also added what comes across as another dig at Thunberg in the process:</p>
      <blockquote>“It was alarming, genuinely alarming. But we don’t blame mankind for it. We’ll let Greta do that.”</blockquote>
      <p>Still that's a pretty big bombshell, the biggest Clarkson has ever done I'd imagine, and if he does start bringing it up on <i>The Grand Tour</i> without the usual snark then maybe some of his viewers will stop dismissing climate change because he told them to.</p>
      <p>But Jeremy is still very much a defender of car owners, claiming that car owners are being hit with higher penalties than vehicles that cause more pollution (like diesel) and that the home produces as much climate-warming gas as the cars of the world.</p>
      <p>Well he has a point about diesel, but that doesn't give petrol cars a free pass. Especially since it's not just about the greenhouse gases. [<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/and-on-that-bombshell-jeremy-clarkson-is-a-climate-change-believer-rgdfnfnss">The Times</a>]</p>
