      <p>(CNN) - Congratulations are in order for Hoda Kotb and Joel Schiffman.</p>
      <p>The "Today" co-anchor broke the news Monday on her show to the delight of her coworkers.</p>
      <p>"I have to tell you something that a friend of mine, a friend of ours, asked me to let you guys in on a secret,'' <a href="https://youtu.be/C3lepv4sbDs">Kotb said.</a> "I'll give you her initials. Her initials are Hoda Kotb, and she's engaged."</p>
      <p>She then pulled out her hand from under the desk where she had been hiding her sizable engagement ring.</p>
      <p>Cue her co-anchors going nuts over the news.</p>
      <p>The couple have been together for six years and are the parents of adopted daughters Haley Joy, 2, and infant Hope Catherine, who joined their family in April.</p>
      <p>Kotb said Schiffman popped the question over the weekend during dinner on the beach while the pair were vacationing.</p>
      <p>"And he was like, 'I have something else I would like to say,'" she said. "He said some beautiful things and then he got down on one knee. He said 'Would you be my wife?'''</p>
      <p>She said she was totally surprised by the proposal.</p>
      <p>"He's good," she said. "He had a good poker face."</p>
      <p>Kotb also joked about how they were going to tell their young daughters, "Your parents are going to get married."</p>
