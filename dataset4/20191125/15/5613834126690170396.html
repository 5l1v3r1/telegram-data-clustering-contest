      <h1>The Next ‘Purge’ Film Begins Casting with ‘Halloween’ and “Swamp Thing” Star Will Patton</h1>

      <p><i>Halloween</i> 2018’s <b>Will Patton</b>, above, and <b>Cassidy Freeman</b> (pictured below in “The Righteous Gemstones”) have joined the cast of the latest <i>Purge</i> feature film from Blumhouse, Platinum Dunes and Universal, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/will-patton-cassidy-freeman-join-blumhouses-new-purge-thriller-1257483">Heat Vision</a> reported over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The two join Mexican actors <b>Ana de la Reguera </b>and<b> Tenoch Huerta</b> in the project that is being directed by <b>Everardo Gout</b> (Nat Geo’s <i>Mars</i>,<i> Luke Cage).</i></p>
      <p>Details about the upcoming thriller are being kept in the hilt, but sources tell <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> that it does take <i>Purge</i> out of its usual metropolitan setting while still dealing with class and race issues in the way the previous films have.</p>
      <p>James DeMonaco, who originated the franchise and wrote and directed the first three chapters, penned the script for the as-yet-untitled installment</p>
      <p>At this time, the film is untitled and we don’t yet have any details, though it’s worth noting that with four films and a TV series currently under the franchise’s belt, it seems DeMonaco has his sights set on calling it a day in the near future. Possibly even with the 2020 film.</p>
      <p>“<i>I have [the next installment] in my head</i>,” DeMonaco recently told <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2018/10/23/the-purge-last-final/">EW</a>. “<i>I think I’m going to write it. <b>I think it’s a great way to end it all. We want to end it all</b>, I think, in this one, and I’m very excited. When I came up with the idea and pitched it to everybody, they seemed psyched, and I think it will be a really cool ending, how we take this one home</i>.”</p>
      <p>Universal Pictures will release the film <b>July 10, 2020</b>.</p>
