      <h1>Week 13 Fantasy Rankings: Defense</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:28:02+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:28</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Lutovsky</a></address>
      <p>Last week once again brought some surprises toward the top of D/ST scoring. Washington, the Jets, Seattle, and Tampa all had big games, while San Francisco also ranked among the best -- not necessarily a surprise because of the team but rather who it was playing against. Either way, this serves as a reminder that D/ST can be a bit unpredictable in any given week, with waiver wire streamers and surprise sleepers capable of big points each game. That's part of what made our Week 13 fantasy defense rankings so difficult to put together. The toughest part, though? Figuring out what to do with the Patriots and 49ers.</p>
      <p>Two of fantasy's top defenses all year, San Francisco (@ Ravens) and New England (@ Texans) both have brutal matchups in Week 13. They both proved their worths in tough matchups last week (with New England getting an assist from the weather), so their owners likely aren't seriously considering sitting them this week. But the 49ers, in particular, are a worry, as the Ravens already showed this year they can severely limit a top D/ST's points. When Baltimore played New England in Week 9 -- also in Baltimore -- the Pats managed just one sacks and two fumble recoveries while allowing 31 offensive points.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Fortunately, there are several legit waiver wire options if you don't want to risk it with either of these D/STs. The Eagles (@ Dolphins), Panthers (vs. Redskins), Jets (@ Bengals), and Packers (@ Giants) all figure to be top plays and are under 40-percent owned in Yahoo leagues. The Redskins (@ Panthers), Chargers (@ Broncos), and Broncos (vs. Chargers) are also decent streamers and sub-40-percent owned.</p>
      <p>Aside from the 49ers and Pats, the Ravens (vs. 49ers), Seahawks (vs. Vikings), Vikings (@ Seahawks), and Saints (@ Falcons) are all highly owned D/STs in tough spots. The Falcons tend to be really good or really bad, so the Saints can still work on Thursday night, and we've seen Jimmy Garoppolohave turnover issues, so the Ravens are also in play at home. Seattle and Minnesota owners should probably hit the waiver wire in search of streamers, though.</p>

            <b>1</b>
          </td>
          <td><b>Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Browns. </b>Pittsburgh's defense has put up big numbers virtually every week since Week 1 -- except for Week 11 against Cleveland. The Steelers managed just one sack and no takeaways that Thursday night in Cleveland, but a second crack at a turnover-prone Browns offense -- this time at home -- should result in better stats. Pittsburgh has at least two takeaways in all but two games this year, and it's racked up at least four sacks in four of the past five games. You can also expect a little extra emotion this time around after Week 11's end-of-game brawl.  </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <b>2</b>
          </td>
          <td><b>Philadelphia Eagles @ Dolphins. </b>The Eagles haven't been anything special on defense this year, save for a monster game back in Week 5 against the Jets, but the Dolphins are as fantasy friendly to D/STs as virtually any team. Even with the offense seemingly getting on track lately, Miami has still allowed at least three sacks in every game but one and turned it over multiple times in five of the past seven contests. Philadelphia managed six sacks and two takeaways against an efficient Seattle offense last week, and over the past four games, it hasn't allowed more than 17 offensive points. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <b>3</b>
          </td>
          <td><b>Carolina Panthers vs. Redskins. </b>Carolina's pass rush has slowed down a bit since the start of the season, but this is still a defense that can get after the quarterback, as shown by its multiple sacks in every game but one this year. Washington has allowed at least three sacks in each of the past five games (20 total) and turned it over six times in that span while averaging 10.8 offensive points per game. That includes nine sacks and three takeaways in the past two games against the defensely challenged Jets and Lions, both of which the 'Skins faced at home. If nothing else, Carolina has a high floor in this one. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <b>4</b>
          </td>
          <td><b>Chicago Bears @ Lions. </b>Chicago has continued to disappoint with sacks and turnovers, total just three QB takedowns and four takeaways the past three games. However, in that span, the Bears have allowed an average of just 14.7 offensive points. In Jeff Driskel's three starts under center, the Lions have allowed 11 sacks and six takeaways while scoring 18.7 offensive points per game. On the shortest turnaround of the season (12:30 p.m. ET kickoff on a Thursday), expect the Bears to do well. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <b>5</b>
          </td>
          <td><b>New York Jets @ Bengals. </b>The Jets have really taken advantage of favorable matchups lately, piling up 16 sacks, three takeaways and a defensive touchdown against the Dolphins, Giants and Redskins in Weeks 9-11, then having their best performance of the year in a neutral matchup last week against the Raiders (sack, two takeaways, defensive TD, three points allowed). The Bengals haven't scored more than 17 points in a game since Week 5 and have allowed 18 sacks, 11 takeaways, and three defensive TDs in their past five games. Andy Dalton, who returns to the lineup after three games on the bench, was quarterback for two of those five games, and he also struggled earlier in the season (11 turnovers, 29 sacks in eight games). There's a strong argument for the Jets to be even higher this week.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <b>6</b>
          </td>
          <td><b>Green Bay Packers @ Giants. </b>The Giants turn the ball over a lot, but their 15 lost fumbles (at least one in all but two games) feels like more bad luck than anything. At some point those numbers figure to regress, but even if they do, Daniel Jones is still good for some sacks and INTs most weeks. The Packers have disappointed in the takeaway department, but they still get a decent amount of QB pressure. When you put it all together, Green Bay should be another high-floor option this week. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <b>7</b>
          </td>
          <td><b>Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Buccaneers. </b>The Jags aren't like most of the teams ahead of them on this list, as their floor isn't nearly as high but they have plenty of upside. Jacksonville has struggled over its past three games (99 points allowed, five sacks), but it's still managed five takeaways. Those matchups weren't particularly fantasy friendly (Texans, Colts, Titans). This week, they get turnover-machine Jameis Winston and the Bucs, who can put up points in a hurry but can give them back just as quickly. Over his past six games, Winston has thrown 15 INTs, and the Bucs as a team have lost six fumbles. Again, this is a high-risk, high-reward play, but you might might not to take that shot if you're gunning for big points this week. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <b>8</b>
          </td>
          <td><b>Los Angeles Rams @ Cardinals. </b>Kyler Murray and the Cardinals have been surprisingly careful with the ball this year, but it's started to show cracks lately, turning it over four times in its past two games. The Rams have been getting steady pressure on QBs, racking up 16 sacks in Weeks 8-11 and allowing just 9.5 offensive ppg in that span. There are reasons to think L.A. has a lower ceiling than usual, but it should still have a nice floor in its first meeting against Murray.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <b>9</b>
          </td>
          <td><b>New England Patriots @ Texans. </b>The Patriots were tamed by Lamar Jackson in Week 9 and have had just two total takeaways in their past two games against the Eagles and Cowboys. They've still managed to keep the scores low (19 total points) and racked up five sacks against Philadelphia (but zero against Dallas). Houston has had protection issues (seven sacks allowed against Baltimore in Week 10) but has always scored points (23.5 per game) and more often than not has one or fewer turnovers. Given all the factors, the Patriots seem like a relatively decent-floor, low-ceiling play, but we know they always have a high ceiling, so they're very much in play this week. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <b>10</b>
          </td>
          <td><b>Baltimore Ravens vs. 49ers. </b>Baltimore has been as hot as any D/ST over the four games leading up to Week 12. In that span, it's scored five defensive TDs and had nine takeaways. The Niners have been solid on offense all season, but Jimmy Garoppolo has been loose with the ball at times, turning it over five times in Weeks 10 and 11 and throwing an INT in all but three games this year. With San Francisco having to travel across the country to play in an early-afternoon game, Baltimore should have a slightly better-than-expected showing. </td>
