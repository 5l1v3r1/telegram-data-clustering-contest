      <p>A sinkhole underneath a train track in Fife has caused rail services to be suspended.</p>
      <p>The dip of about a metre opened up below the line at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/ferry-chaos-after-celtic-match-20954751">Leuchars</a> on Monday morning, with a "possible track defect" reported at around 10.30am.</p>
      <p>ScotRail services between <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/ferry-chaos-after-celtic-match-20954751">Aberdeen and Edinburgh</a> were instead starting and terminating at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/ferry-chaos-after-celtic-match-20954751">Dundee</a> , with a shuttle bus service in operation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/ferry-chaos-after-celtic-match-20954751">Network Rail</a> shared a tweet with pictures of the sinkhole, confirming engineers were at the scene.</p>

      <p>It said: "A sinkhole has caused a dip to open up below one of the lines at Leuchars.</p>
      <p>"It's around a metre deep &amp; will require 3 tonnes of ballast (stones to go below the track) to fill.</p>
      <p>"Disruption is likely to last until the end of the day."</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/ferry-chaos-after-celtic-match-20954751">ScotRail</a> spokesman said: "We're sorry to our customers who have experienced disruption to their journey today.</p>
      <p>"Engineers are working as quickly as possible to repair the sinkhole and get services back to normal.</p>
      <p>"Anyone delayed 30 minutes or more can claim money back through the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/ferry-chaos-after-celtic-match-20954751">Delay Repay Guarantee</a> on our website or mobile app."</p>
      <p>Caledonian Sleeper said on Twitter: "Due to a sinkhole at Leuchars, we are unable to run our usual route south of Dundee and the train will be diverted via Perth.</p>
      <p>"We will attempt to contact all guests who were due to join the train at Dundee, Leuchars, Kirkcaldy and Inverkeithing for alternative arrangements."</p>
      <p>LNER and CrossCountry services are also affected.</p>
