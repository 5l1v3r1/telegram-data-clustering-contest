        <b>Mike Tindall believes <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-haskell/">James Haskell</a> jumped at the chance to befriend <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> to feed off her social media followers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ouch.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old former English rugby union player and husband to royal <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/zara-phillips/">Zara Tindall</a>, said he’s ‘keeping an eye’ on his friend while he’s in the Australian jungle.</p>
      <p>When asked by JOE co-host Alex Payne what he made of James’ first 48 hours on the show, Mike responded: ‘I think he’s been alright so far.’</p>
      <p>He then didn’t hold back as he spilled all of the tea.</p>
      <p>‘I definitely knew if he ever had the chance to pick a pairing, he would pick Caitlyn,’ Mike theorised. ‘He just sees social media followers from her… daughters. And a possible meeting.’</p>
      <p>‘Chloe [Madeley, James’ wife], be careful,’ he jokingly added.</p>

      <p>Mike also remarked James is likely to snap when he’s hungry.</p>

      <p>‘Now, it’s whether how much food they actually get, because he was getting a little bit hungry, wasn’t he,’ he said.</p>
      <p>Over the course of the show, Caitlyn, 70, and James, 34, have developed a special friendship in the jungle.</p>
      <p>They made a hilarious pair when they were the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/im-a-celebritys-caitlyn-jenner-and-james-haskell-reacting-to-freezing-shower-water-is-comedy-gold-11178385/">first contestants to brave having a cold shower</a>.</p>
      <p>James was first up out of all of the campmates to have a shower and he initially looked cool, calm and collected.</p>

      <p>But after he got a face full of freezing cold water, he let out a scream.</p>
      <p>Cut to him telling the camera about the experience: ‘Brisk, is what I would describe it as.’</p>
      <p>Then it was Caitlyn’s turn, who rocked up in a two-piece black bikini and hair tied up in a ponytail.</p>
      <p>But as soon as the water hit her body, she closed her eyes and screamed.</p>
      <p>‘It was just so refreshing,’ Caitlyn said, after getting water in her mouth and coughing up a storm.</p>
      <p>What a bond.</p>
