          </p>
          <p>Manchester United had a dramatic escape against Sheffield United in the last night match in the Premier, as the game ended in a 3-3 draw, the Red Devils were trailing for the most part of the game.</p>
          <p>In the first half of the game, the Blades were all over the pitch and <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/sheffield-united-vs-manchester-united-david-de-gea-makes-terrific-double-save/">David De Gea was preventing their attacks being successful</a> but he could not get it right all the time, and by the 52nd minute, Manchester United was trailing by 2 goals.</p>

                      <p>The English defender saw himself suffer for the first 45 minutes of the game and was taken out during the half-time, Jesse Lingard replaced him in the other half.</p>

                          <p>Mousset caused Jones all sorts of problems in the first half and it was he who bullied Jones to the ground in the build-up of John Fleck’s goal in the 15th minute of the game.</p>
                          <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148">
                            <p>Jones was out-muscled by the 23-year-old who darted into the Manchester United box and made the cross which led to Fleck’s strike. Later, the <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/sheffield-united-vs-manchester-united-watch-marcus-rashford-make-manchester-united-comeback-against-sheffield-united/">Red Devils recovered the damage by darting three goals</a> and were on the verge of miraculously winning the game but a <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/sheffield-united-vs-man-utd-var-controversy-united-fans-claim-that-var-would-have-cancelled-the-goal-if-liverpool-were-playing-tonight/">late goal by Oli McBurnie</a> avoided the worst for Sheffield united.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile, the 27-year-old Jones has seen his chances in Ole Solskjaer’s side limited this season following Maguire’s arrival. Many United fans lamented his inclusion yesterday and believed Axel Tuanzebe should have started in the three-man defence.</p>
