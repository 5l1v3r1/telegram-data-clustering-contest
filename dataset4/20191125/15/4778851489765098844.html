      <p>Both carriageways were closed for efforts to recover the vehicle, with a crash scene investigation taking place.</p>
      <p>The southbound carriageway reopened around midday but the northbound carriageway remained shut.</p>
      <p>Inspector Campbell Moffat said: "We are appealing to anyone who may have been on the A74(M) motorway this morning to get in touch if they saw this crash.</p>
      <p>"We would also be keen to hear from anyone who may have captured any dashcan footage of the crash, or the northbound lorry just prior to the crash.</p>
      <p>"Anyone with any information should call police on the 101 number and quote the reference number 0454 25 November 2019."</p>
