      <h1>Weekend Roundup: Protests against racism, Bale deals with boos, City dump Chelsea</h1>
      <h2>The big Premier League clash between Chelsea and Manchester City did not disappoint, two Dutch teams were part of a unique protest against racism and Gareth Bale was subjected to boos by his team's supporters.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:33:18+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/sports-desk/" target="_blank">Sports Desk</a></address>
      <p>With players back from the international break, club football saw significant developments, including Jose Mourinho’s return to the Premier League as the manager of Tottenham Hotspur. The weekend also saw a big Premier League clash, an anti-racism protest, Bale being booed and on-pitch blunders.</p>
      <h3>Here are the talking points from the weekend:</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Chelsea goes down to a big club, again</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the biggest Premier League clash of the weekend, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/english-premier-league/manchester-city-battle-back-for-crucial-win-over-chelsea-6134270/">Manchester City came from behind to beat a young Chelsea 2-1</a> and stay within nine points of English Premier League leader Liverpool. The win, however, came at a price, as Pep Guardiola lost Sergio Aguero to a groin injury.</p>
      <p>All the goals in an end-to-end contest at Etihad Stadium came in the first half as City responded to N’Golo Kante’s 21st-minute strike with goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez. Raheem Sterling looked like he had added a third, but his injury-time strike was ruled out for offside in a very tight VAR call (yes, again with City).</p>

      <p>Frank Lampard’s side, which needs to be given credit for their campaign despite a transfer ban, has failed other big tests in this season including a 4-0 loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford on the opening day of the season, and a 2-1 home reverse against Liverpool in September.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Anti-racism, sexism protest</b>
      </p>
      <p>After Excelsior player Ahmad Mendes was subjected to racist abuse by fans, Ajax and visitors Heracles players <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/ajax-vs-heracles-racism-protest-6134506/">protest against racism by not kicking the ball in the first minute</a> of their Dutch Eredivisie meeting. The Dutch league leaders kicked off, but both sets of players then remained stationary and applauded for the next 60 seconds, with match officials and supporters joining in.</p>
      <p>During the protest, the scoreboard displayed the message, “Racism? Then we don’t play football.”</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the Italian league promoted the ‘give violence against women the red card’ campaign as Juventus stars did their bit in raising awareness about the initiative targeting violence against women. Paulo Dybala and Gonzalo Higuaine were among the Old Lady stars who supported the initiative with red stripes painted on their cheeks during the domestic clashes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jose Mourinho delivers winning start as Spurs manager</b>
      </p>
      <p>Instilling life in a lacklustre Tottenham Hotspur in his first match as manager, Jose Mourinho began a new chapter as a Premier League team boss by delivering the team’s first league win in two months.</p>

      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/english-premier-league/west-ham-vs-tottenham-hotspur-jose-mourinho-first-win-6133779/">Spurs beat West Ham United 3-2</a> as Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane scored in a 13-minute span around halftime at the Olympic Stadium. Undeniably, Spurs had a spark to its play rarely seen in the final months of Mauricio Pochettino’s reign.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Manchester United concede 90th-minute equaliser</b>
      </p>
      <p>Manchester United failed to climb to the fifth place in the Premier League standings as the Ole Gunnar Solskjaer-led side conceded a 90th-minute equaliser after rallying from a two-goal deficit to<a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/manchester-united-vs-sheffield-united-highlights-video-6135040/"> draw 3-3 with Sheffield United.</a></p>

      <p>Trailing 2-0 after 52 minutes, Man United scored three goals in a seven-minute period from the 72nd to go ahead in dramatic fashion. All of those goals were scored by academy graduates, with 19-year-old Brandon Williams and 18-year-old Mason Greenwood netting for the first time in the league, before Marcus Rashford completed the remarkable comeback.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bale booed at Santiago as Real Madrid march on</b>
      </p>
      <p>There seems to be no end to the Gareth Bale-Real Madrid saga as the Welsh player was jeered by the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium crowd when he went on as a late substitute. Why? Because fans were angry at <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/gareth-bale-in-madrid-jibe-after-helping-wales-reach-euro-2020-6128131/">Bale’s jibe at the club</a> during the international break when he was seen dancing and laughing behind a banner that read ‘Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that Order.’</p>
      <p>In the game on Sunday, Bale was booed every time he touched the ball.</p>

      <p>That, however, did not stop Zinedine Zidane’s side from <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/la-liga/real-madrid-keep-pace-with-barcelona-as-gareth-bale-suffers-hostile-reception-6134285/">beating Real Sociedad 3-1</a> as they made up for an early howler by captain Sergio Ramos. The Spanish defender allowed Willian Jose to calmly round keeper Thibaut Courtois and pass the ball into the empty net, stunning the Bernabeu into silence.</p>
      <p>The victory allowed second-placed Real to stay within striking distance of league leaders Barcelona, who also have 28 points after 13 games, but top the standings due to a superior goal difference.</p>
