      <p>We're not even at the end of 2019 yet but there are already a host of cracking gigs to look forward to in and around Bristol next year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife/bristol-sounds-2020-noel-gallagher-3569475">The lineup for Bristol Sounds was announced today</a> (November 25) and includes the likes of Noel Gallagher, Supergrass and The Levellers while those willing to travel a little further can enjoy scenic gigs as part of Forest Live.</p>
      <p>Forest Live is a major outdoor live music series held every year by Forestry England at three locations across the UK including Westonbirt Arboretum, less than an hour's drive from Bristol.</p>
      <p>Last week <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife/young-james-morrison-co-headline-3549029">Will Young and James Morrison were announced as the first headliners</a> and today organisers have revealed they will be joined by English rockers Keane.</p>

      <p>The band made a welcome return in 2019 after a six-year hiatus, with their latest album Cause and Effect and a triumphant sold-out UK tour.</p>
      <p>This release follows on from their succession of previous number one albums which have accumulated more than 13 million sales worldwide including Under The Iron Sea, Perfect Symmetry, Strangeland and debut smash Hopes and Fears.</p>
      <p>Generating hit singles Somewhere Only We Know, Everybody’s Changing, This Is The Last Time and Bedshaped, the quartet's first record became one of the biggest selling albums in UK chart history.</p>
      <p>Keane last appeared as part of Forest Live in 2010, and the upcoming dates will see them return to perform material from their extensive repertoire.</p>
