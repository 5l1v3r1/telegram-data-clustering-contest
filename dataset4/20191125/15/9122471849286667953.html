      <h1>Jason Garrett Makes Troubling Admission Following Loss To Patriots</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:31:51+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Jason Garrett’s most-criticized decision in Sunday evening’s loss to the New England Patriots came on a 4th and 7 inside the red zone. The Cowboys trailed the Patriots, 13-6, with about six minutes to play. Garrett opted to kick a field goal, cutting the lead to four points, instead of going for it on fourth down.</p>
      <p>FOX analyst Troy Aikman criticized the decision immediately, saying he would have gone for it. Others in football seemed to agree.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.espn.com/espn/now?nowId=21-41085957-4">win probability stats</a> sided with Aikman and others.</p>
      <blockquote>The win probability, had they gone for it was 18.8 percent, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Info. By kicking the field goal, the win probability was 16.7%</blockquote>
      <p>Garrett was asked about the win probability stats following the game. It turns out that the Cowboys’ coaching staff doesn’t use them during the game.</p>
      <p>“We don’t use those stats during the game,” he told reporters.</p>
      <p>Other teams, like the 8-2 Baltimore Ravens, reportedly use them on every play…</p>

      <p>Garrett is rightfully under fire for his performance as head coach this season. The Cowboys simply have too much talent to be 6-5, even if that record is good enough for first place in the NFC East.</p>
      <p>Jerry Jones had the most telling comment of all following the game.</p>
      <p>“With the makeup of this team, I shouldn’t be this frustrated.”</p>
      <p>Jones isn’t wrong, though he is in a place to change things. We’ll see if Garrett can do enough to save his job moving forward.</p>
