      <p>With Hulu getting ready to deck the halls with <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3594875/trailer-darks-christmas-themed-nasty-piece-work-video/">horror on the Dec. 6 episode</a> of <b>“Into the Dark”</b>, they’re setting their sights on 2020 with their New Year’s Eve-themed episode <b>“Midnight Kiss”</b>.</p>
      <p>However, the newest episode will actually drop on <b>December 27, 2019</b>, offering you something horrific to watch on New Year’s Eve.</p>
      <p>What makes this episode extra noteworthy is that it’s directed by none other than <b>Carter Smith</b>, the filmmaker behind the criminally underrated<i> The Ruins</i>.</p>
      <p>In the episode, “A group of longtime gay best friends and their resident fruit fly head to a beautiful desert home to celebrate New Year’s Eve. One of their annual traditions is to play “Midnight Kiss”, a sexy but ultimately dangerous challenge to find that special someone to help you ring in the New Year.</p>
      <p>“As friendships have grown strained with secrets, jealousy and resentment, the group faces another challenge when a sadistic killer wants in. Relationships are put to the test and truths are revealed as the night turns into a fight for survival.”</p>
      <p><b>Augustus Prew</b> (<i>The Morning Show</i>), <b>Scott Evans</b> (<i>Grace and Frankie</i>), <b>Ayden Mayeri</b> (<i>Veep</i>), <b>Lukas Gage </b>(<i>Euphoria</i>), <b>Chester Lockhart </b>(<i>Glamorous</i>), and <b>Adam Faiso</b>n (<i>Everything’s Gonna Be OK</i>) star.</p>
