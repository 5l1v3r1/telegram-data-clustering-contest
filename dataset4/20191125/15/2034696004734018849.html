      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/joker-review-a-melancholic-psychodrama-punctuated-by-splashes-of-shocking-violence"><i>Joker</i></a>‘s composer has revealed that “large parts” of the movie were shot to her score, and that the cast improvised scenes to the music she composed.</p>
      <p>The movie recently became the <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/joker-is-now-the-most-profitable-comic-book-movie-ever-2566179">most profitable comic book movie ever,</a> as well as the <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/ryan-reynolds-reacts-as-joker-overtakes-deadpool-to-become-biggest-r-rated-movie-ever-2561459">highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time</a>.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>It seems, however, that much of the actual movie wasn’t scripted, as according to composer Hildur Guðnadóttir <i>Joker</i> star Joaquin Phoenix used the music to help develop his character while filming the movie.</p>
      <p>“Joaquin told me a few weeks ago that he was having some problems finding this transition from Arthur to Joker,” she told <a href="https://www.goldderby.com/article/2019/hildur-guonadottir-joker-composer-oscars-interview-news/"><i>Gold Derby</i></a>, adding that the music “was a key part in that process.”</p>
      <p>“They shot large parts of the movie to the music,” Guðnadóttir continued. “There are some scenes that didn’t exist in the script that are just Joaquin responding to the music.”</p>

      <p>One of those scenes is the moment Arthur Fleck dances in the bathroom after committing his first violent act.</p>
      <p>“What we see in the movie is him responding in real-time to the music, and that’s the turning point of Arthur becoming Joker,” the composer further explained.</p>
      <p>One of the movie’s co-stars recently opened-up about working with Phoenix on set, admitting that the lead star had <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/joaquin-phoenix-only-had-one-rule-while-on-set-for-joker-2558250">a condition of not working with “assholes”</a>.</p>

      <p>Josh Pais recalled a conversation he had with director Todd Phillips regarding what Phoenix had told him: “I don’t care who you cast, just make sure everybody is a really good actor — and no assholes. So, I guess I passed the test.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, following reports that <i>Joker</i> is set to get a sequel, it has since emerged that there are <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/happening-joker-sequel-confirmed-2569860">“no deals” for <i>Joker 2</i> “at this point”</a>.</p>
