      <h1>Report: Toby Alderweireld open to new Tottenham talks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:18:01+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dhnet.be/sports/football/diablesrouges/alderweireld-pret-a-rester-avec-jose-mourinho-chez-les-spurs-5ddab2b49978e272f9262230">Belgian outlet DH have claimed</a> that Tottenham Hotspur star Toby Alderweireld is open to new talks over extending his contract in north London following the appointment of Jose Mourinho as manager.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old is one of three players currently in the final months of their current contract, along with Jan Vertonghen and Christian Eriksen. The trio will be allowed to talk to non-English clubs from January 1, on a pre-contract basis.</p>
      <p>That is, of course, unless they sign a new deal. The latest report claims that Alderweireld was one of the players Mourinho meant when he said that he had tried to sign a handful of Spurs stars while at Manchester United and Chelsea.</p>
      <p>It is believed that the appointment of Mourinho has made Alderweireld more open to signing a new deal and reaffirming his commitment to Spurs. The report also claims that Alderweireld wants £94,000 a week. He currently earns £80,000 (<a href="https://www.spotrac.com/epl/tottenham-hotspur-f.c/payroll/">Spotrac</a>).</p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Of the three players, keeping Alderweireld is key</h3>
      <p>There has been plenty of talk that all three may have changed their minds over remaining at Spurs, given the change in management and the renewed atmosphere around the club. Mourinho has not only come in, but there are new staff too.</p>
      <p>Vertonghen will turn 33 before his contract expires and he has certainly lost a yard of pace. Renewing his contract would only see Spurs keep a player that is detriorating, and far past his best.</p>
      <p>Eriksen is a top, top player but his lack of effort in recent matches has been a cause of frustration and anger for Spurs fans. Of the three players, Alderweireld is the one that Spurs need to keep.</p>
