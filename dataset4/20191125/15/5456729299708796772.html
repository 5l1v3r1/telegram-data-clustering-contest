      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:13:32+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/365142-maurice-iwus-n1-2-billion-fraud-trial-stalled.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The N1.2 billion fraud trial of Professor Maurice Iwu, a former Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), was on Monday stalled because Justice Nicholas Oweibo of the Federal High Court in Lagos, was not available.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Mr Iwu is facing a three-count charge of fraud and money laundering brought against him by the <a href="https://efccnigeria.org/">Economic and Financial Crimes Commission</a> (EFCC).</p>
      <p>He was first arraigned on August 8 before Justice Chuka Obiozor, also of the Federal High Court in Lagos, who granted him bail in the sum of N1 billion.</p>
      <p>Mr Iwu pleaded not guilty before the judge</p>

      <p>Following the transfer of the case to Mr Oweibo, the former INEC chairman was re-arraigned by the anti-graft commission on October 24.</p>
      <p>He also pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>Mr Oweibo adjourned until November 29 for the commencement of trial.</p>
      <p>Due to the absence of the judge on Monday, the case was again adjourned until February 27, 2020.</p>
      <p>According to Rotimi Oyedepo, the lead counsel to EFCC, Mr Iwu, committed the alleged offences from December 2014 to March 27, 2015.</p>
      <p>“The defendant aided the concealment of N1.23 billion in the account of Bioresources Institute of Nigeria Ltd. with number 1018603119, domiciled in the United Bank for Africa.</p>
      <p>“He ought to have reasonably known that the N1.23 billion formed part of the proceeds of fraud,” Mr Oyedepo said.</p>
      <p>NAN reports that the alleged offences contravene Sections 15(2) and 18(a) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011, and is punishable under Section 15(3) of the Act.</p>
