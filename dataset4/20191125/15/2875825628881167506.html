      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:39:51+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/brynmor-pattison/" target="_blank">Brynmor Pattison</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/rte">RTE</a> radio host Rick O'Shea has told how he was "almost killed" by a van driver who was on his <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/mobile-phones">mobile phone</a>.</p>
      <p>The broadcaster was travelling in a 100km/h zone on the N5 through Strokestown in Co <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/roscommon">Roscommon</a> towards Westport in Co <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/mayo">Mayo</a> with his wife in the car when they came upon a bend in the road.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, a van driver careened around the corner on his side of the road.</p>
      <p>Luckily for all involved, the man managed to correct his course.</p>
      <p>Mr O'Shea said in slightly different circumstances he and his wife "would have been mincemeat" and "there was nothing I could have done".</p>
      <p>He added that he was sharing the story because "it might save someone else's life".</p>

      <p>Sharing an image of the N5 route through Strokestown in Co Roscommon on Twitter, he began: "So I was almost killed at the weekend.</p>
      <p>"My wife too. At roughly this place. Please read this short thread and share it, it might save someone else's life and if that comes of this then fair enough...</p>
      <p>"We were driving to Westport when, near Strokestown in a 100Kph zone, we came to a right-hand bend in the road.</p>
      <p>"Just as we were on top of it a van came around the corner towards us *ON OUR SIDE OF THE ROAD*.</p>
      <p>"I caught a glimpse of the driver. He was on his mobile making a call.</p>

      <p>"He managed to veer himself over to his own side of the road but if we'd been 30 feet further up the road or he had been distracted by what he was doing for 2 or 3 more seconds we all would have been mincemeat.</p>
      <p>"There was nothing I could have done.</p>
      <p>"He won't see this. He'll go on barreling down the roads of Ireland at full speed taking calls.</p>
      <p>"But if this makes you think again about doing one of the most dangerous things you can do when you're in charge of a giant metal bomb, then this will have been worth it.</p>

      <p>"We might not have been here today if not for a split second margin. We would all be statistics.</p>
      <p>"Pull in if you need to make or take a call.</p>
      <p>"DON'T USE YOUR PHONE WHILE DRIVING. Thanks."</p>
