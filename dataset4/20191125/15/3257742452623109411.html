      <p>To qualify to make the donation, purchases must be made with <a href="http://appleinsider.com/topic/apple+pay">Apple Pay</a> and must be conducted at Apple.com, through the Apple Store app, or at a physical Apple Store worldwide. Donations will be collected up through December 2, and the donation is capped at a total of $1 million. <br/><br/>The announcement of the initiative was made though Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/product-red/">Product(Red) page</a>, which curates their current offerings helping to fund the fight against AIDS. Apple's Product(RED) line includes <a href="http://appleinsider.com/topic/iphone">iPhones</a> and iPhone cases, <a href="http://appleinsider.com/topic/ipad">iPad</a> smart covers, <a href="http://appleinsider.com/topic/beats">Beats</a> headphones and speakers, <a href="http://appleinsider.com/topic/apple+watch">Apple Watch</a> bands, and more.<br/><br/>As well as purchases counting towards the donation, people can also donate directly via <a href="https://www.red.org/">Red.org</a>. <br/><br/>Product(RED) is a brand that seeks to raise both awareness and funds to help eliminate HIV and AIDS in eight African countries including Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzina, and Zambia. 100% of all money generated by (RED) partners goes to fund HIV/AIDS programs on the ground in these sub-Saharan African countries.<br/><br/>The initiative has led to special versions of <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/11/28/iphone-xr-is-topping-xs-xs-max-in-sales-says-apples-greg-joswiak">the iPhone</a> in the color to be released over the years, and has raised <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/17/11/30/apple-says-over-30m-raised-for-global-fund-in-2017-through-red-products">millions of dollars</a> in the process.</p>
