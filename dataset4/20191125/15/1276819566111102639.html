      <p>A couple and their dog visited a lake in Chickaloon, Alaska, in mid-November. And lucky for us, they brought their ice skates!</p>
      <p>The video above shows them majestically gliding along the freshly frozen ice, with mountains and snow as a beautiful backdrop.</p>
      <p>It's fun to watch them weave in and out as they move quickly across the cold reflective surface, even doing some fun dance moves along the way.</p>
      <p>The outing, while fun to watch, was also a much needed break for the woman you see skating in the video.</p>
      <p>"The skater in the video is my partner, Daisy Moser, who is currently going through chemo for breast cancer," John Giraldo, the man who filmed the outing, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz3MJYkihjk">told ViralHog</a>. "She had just gone through her fifth infusion four days before we took this video. Only one infusion left to go."</p>
      <p>It's not only a beautiful glimpse of ice skating in Alaska, but a reason to be thankful for the little things in life â€” no matter what life throws your way.</p>
