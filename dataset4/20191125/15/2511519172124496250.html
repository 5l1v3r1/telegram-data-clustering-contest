      <h1>Brescia defend Mario Balotelli ‘black’ comment as ‘misunderstood joke’</h1>
      <h2>President Massimo Cellino has caused controversy with his latest comments on the Italian striker</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:35:11+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:35</time> by <a rel="author">Jack Rathborn</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brescia">Brescia</a> have labelled Massimo Cellino’s controversial comments on striker <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/MarioBalotelli">Mario Balotelli</a> as merely a ”misunderstood joke”.</p>
      <p>Cellino, when questioned on the former Manchester City striker’s recent fallout with head coach Fabio Grosso, claimed, “he is black and he is working to clear himself”. </p>
      <p>The comments followed the player being left out of the squad to face Roma at the weekend after a disagreement with Grosso, which saw him storm out of training.</p>
      <p>Balotelli, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/mario-balotelli-racist-abuse-walk-off-brescia-verona-serie-a-a9183376.html">who suffered racial abuse during a game against Hellas Verona earlier this month,</a> took to social media before the game, stating: “Recovery! Coming back soon, for the moment let them talk.”</p>
      <p>When pushed on the latest, Cellino remarked:<b> </b>“What should I tell you about him? He is black, but he is working to clear himself but is having many difficulties.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“In football there are teams that fight and win, if we think that a player on his own can win matches, we would be offending the team. Otherwise, we would play one against eleven.” </p>
      <p>A club statement has since been released, labelling the comments as a “joke” that has been “misunderstood”.</p>
      <p>It read: “Concerning the declarations released this afternoon by president Massimo Cellino, referring to our player Mario Balotelli, Brescia evidently deem it to be a paradoxical joke and clearly misunderstood.</p>
      <p>“It was said in an attempt to defuse excessive media exposure, as well as with the intent to protect the player himself.”</p>

      <p>Cellino also hinted at a possible sale in January by claiming Balotelli has become a distraction to the team.</p>
      <p>“The manager made a mistake by speaking in the press conference about only Balotelli and not about the team as a whole,” Cellino continued.</p>
      <p>“I signed him at the end of the window, not to sell tickets, but because he could be of real value. </p>
      <p>“But it’s now become a point of weakness because of the overexposure. </p>
      <p>“If we keep talking about him, it’ll only hurt us and him.”</p>
