      <p>She told Piers and Susanna she was happy, and Piers replied: "Any wedding bells?"</p>
      <p>"Well I'm waiting aren't I", said the GC.</p>
      <p>"Has he never asked you?", questioned Piers.</p>
      <p>"No!" Gemma, 38, exclaimed, adding that she didn't know why.</p>
      <p>Piers suggested to James, 31, that he should propose over the festive season.</p>

      <p>"I can't wait much longer", Gemma said.</p>
      <p>"It's either soon, or I'm out of here."</p>
      <p>She added: "I am getting a little older now I need the big bling on my finger.</p>
      <p>"If it’s meant to be…I don’t lose sleep out of it.</p>

      <p>She then looked directly to the camera and demanded to James, who was most likely still asleep at the early hour: "Call De Beers diamonds now James, wakey wakey!"</p>
      <p>She went on to give James crystal clear instructions that she wants a ring "like Elizabeth Taylor's".</p>
      <p>Piers joked: "It can’t get more direct than that, James."</p>

      <p>Gemma and Arg have been together on and off for ten years, and their tumultuous relationship has grabbed headlines since it began.</p>
      <p>According to Heat, Gemma has vowed to have a child with James within the next couple of years, but plans to have fun until he is fully "back on his feet".</p>
      <p>It appeared the TOWIE love birds were done for good when Arg moved back to his mum's in October after Gemma called 999 amid concerns for his welfare when he failed to return her calls.</p>
      <p>Gemma, who feared Arg had overdosed, was said to have decided to call it off for good over after the scare.</p>

      <p>The insider also told the publication: "Gemma's going to try anything she can to get Arg back on his feet.</p>
      <p>The ultimate goal is for them to become parents and she's vowed to Arg that she'll make it happen."</p>
