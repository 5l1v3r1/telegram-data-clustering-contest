      <p>The prosecutor's office in Kyiv region demands that 34 hectares of forest land be returned to state ownership.</p>
      <p>"The prosecutor's office in Kyiv region has filed a lawsuit with the Commercial Court of Kyiv region to recover to state ownership from illegal possession land plots with a total area of over 34 hectares, located within the administrative borders of the Obukhiv city council,"  the press service for the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine reports.</p>
      <p>It is noted that, according to the lawsuit, during 2003-2004, contrary to the requirements of land and forest legislation, a single forest mass of land plots of the Obukhiv forestry was leased and later sold to legal entities, with the division into two separate sections.</p>
      <p>"Thus, the entire array of illegally allotted lands is owned by two legal entities associated with a close relative of one of incumbent lawmakers," reads the report.</p>
