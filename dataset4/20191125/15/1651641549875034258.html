      <p>Intel today announced partnership with MediaTek to enable 5G PCs from Windows OEMs. As part of this partnership, Intel will certify a 5G solution specification and a 5G modem from MediaTek. Intel also mentioned that it will offer optimization and validation across the platform and provide system integration and co-engineering support to further enable Windows OEMs. HP and Dell will be the first Windows OEMs to deliver laptops based on MediaTek 5G modems and the devices are expected to be available in early 2021.</p>
      <p>“Our 5G modem for PCs, developed in partnership with Intel, is integral to making 5G accessible and available across home and mobile platforms,” said MediaTek President Joe Chen. “5G will usher in the next era of PC experiences, and working with Intel, an industry leader in computing, highlights MediaTek’s expertise in designing 5G technology for global markets. With this partnership, consumers will be able to browse, stream and game faster on their PCs, but we also expect them to innovate with 5G in ways we have not yet imagined.”</p>
      <p>“5G is poised to unleash a new level of computing and connectivity that will transform the way we interact with the world. This partnership with MediaTek brings together industry leaders with deep engineering, system integration and connectivity expertise to deliver 5G experiences on the next generation of the world’s best PCs,” Gregory Bryant, Intel executive vice president and general manager of the Client Computing Group.</p>
