      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/phoebe-waller-bridge/">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> has described the emotionally fleeting moment that she let go of our favourite TV anti-heroine <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fleabag/">Fleabag</a>, and how she’s found closure by no longer knowing where she is or what she would be doing now.</p>
      <p>The Emmy and Bafta Award-winning writer and actress also spoke of her gratitude for her ‘gift for rage’ propelled by her oppressive catholic schooling, and struggle to get to work in the industry during her 20s.</p>
      <p>Recalling the final performance of her one-woman show in the West End in the summer – following its second series adaptation for the BBC – Waller-Bridge explained at an event in New York on Sunday night launching the release of her new book Fleabag: The Scriptures: ‘This is one of the most sentimental things I’ve ever felt and I’ve ever said and I’m sorry if it makes you feel sick but it’s true.</p>

      <p>‘I was performing the end and I was really emotional and I was suddenly hit by the whole journey of the character and … I felt her go. And it was such a lovely feeling, “ah we’ve done the right thing we’ve ended the story at the right time”.’</p>

      <p>On the inspiration behind her unconventional character, the star continued: ‘It was driven by that sense of rage. What if I just said onstage what I say to my friend? Or if I just express some of the rage that I have but turn it up?</p>
      <p>‘The only way I could really describe the character to someone once when they asked me was: when I was feeling at my most down and angry and rageful standing at the precipice of whatever that is in your mind and I looked at the bottom of the chasm and the very bottom was Fleabag. So I was like I’m going to write her to stop me becoming her.’</p>

      <p>It was after her restrictive Catholic education and graduating from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts that her rage peaked: ‘When I was in my 20s and feeling quite frustrated by my position in the industry by just wanting a job. That was pretty much it.</p>
      <p>‘But also in life as well, just feeling my place in the world as a woman and as a woman who wanted to write and act and how I felt about myself physically and what my power was, all that kind of stuff was going on at the same time, I did feel this real rage underneath it all. But I didn’t ever want to express pure rage to people so I think it came out as jokes. Fleabag was the expression of the kind of “ahhhh that came out”.’</p>

      <p>Waller-Bridge has obviously been inundated with work since the success of Fleabag, recently contributing to the script for the latest Bond film and landing a $20million (£15m) deal creating and producing new work for Amazon.</p>
      <p>The actress admitted that she’s excited to have an idea (no details have been released yet) but she’s also feeling the immense pressure to get the audience on side again.</p>
      <p>‘That’s all I care about,’ she said. ‘I really really care. I really want it to have impact every single time. It drives me insane because the constant voice of it’s not funny enough or what’s the point? All that kind of stuff. I feel like each time I’m writing something it has to be the best thing I’ve ever written, which isn’t fun to be around.’</p>
      <p>And when asked where Fleabag could be right now, she replied: ‘I don’t actually know where she is now. And I think that’s the right thing for both of us.’</p>
