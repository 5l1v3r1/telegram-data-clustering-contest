      <p>Dwayne Haskins was simply excited about getting his first win of his career as well as celebrating the team’s second win of the year.</p>
      <p>The Washington Redskins beat the Detroit Lions, 19-16, on Sunday, but before the game was actually over, Haskins was seen on the sidelines near fans and taking selfies with them.</p>
      <p>He wasn’t available for the final victory kneel down snap as Case Keenum took the field.</p>

      <p>That did not sit well with Redskins legend Joe Theismann.</p>

      <p>Haskins probably should have been on the field to take that final snap, but was seriously a non-issue as the game was done and he just had a screw-up because of his excitement.</p>
      <p>Callahan explained after the game Haskins likely didn’t realize that there was time left in the game amid his excitement.</p>
      <p>“I think he thought the game was over. I’m happy we won. We’ll address that.”</p>
