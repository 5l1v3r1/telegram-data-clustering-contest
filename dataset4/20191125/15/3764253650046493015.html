      </p>
      <p>Just like ex Big Brother Naija(BBNaija) stars Bambam and Teddy A who are now a couple, it appears two lovers in the 2019 season of the reality show, Mercy and Ike, may be into one another more than people may know.</p>
      <p>Recall that the pair had given viewers mixed feeling with their affair back when they were still in the competition. However, doubts of their love for each other has since been dismissed, with the way they dote over one another.</p>

      <p>Ike had featured on a live video session on a friend’s Instagram account, and among those that watch the video, a particular user had pointed out that guys that are named Ike are known to be cheats, as such, the reality star’s friend should hook Mercy up with someone else.</p>
      <p>The friend immediately responded saying, Ike isn’t a cheat and would never think of cheating on Mercy.</p>
      <p>This was followed by Ike pointing out that Mercy is not going anywhere because they love each other. He said internet trolls can continue making efforts to come in between them</p>
      <p>Watch the video below:</p>
