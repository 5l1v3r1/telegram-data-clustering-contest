      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2019/10/21/20926218/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-trailer-easter-eggs-references-emperor-explained"><i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i></a><i> </i>comes out in less than a month. While another full-length trailer isn’t likely to drop before then, Lucasfilm unveiled some small clips on Monday featuring brief movie moments and behind-the-scenes actions.</p>
      <p>This latest clip from Episode 9 shows a chase scene across Pasaana, a new desert planet (the Star Wars galaxy sure loves its desert planets). While our heroes have the upperhand initially, the Stormtroopers quickly catch up to them — and eject from their vehicle and soar through the air.</p>
      <p>“ARRGHHHHHHGHH?!” says Chewbacca.</p>
      <p>“THEY FLY NOW!” exclaims C-3PO.</p>
      <p>“They fly now?!” questions Finn.</p>
      <p>“They fly now,” states Poe.</p>
      <p>Why did it take so long for the First Order Stormtroopers to get little jetpacks equipped onto their uniforms? Doesn’t that seem like a standard thing to have in a galaxy far, far away?</p>
      <p>Over the weekend, another behind-the-scenes clip revealed cameos by Lin Manuel-Miranda and Ed Sheeran, along with making of footage from Star Wars past.</p>

      <p>Much like the Stormtroopers, <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> flies into theaters on Dec. 20.</p>
