      <p>A nursery where children regularly 'come home messy' has received outstanding feedback across the board.</p>
      <p>Peapod Day Nursery in Hickling Pastures, south Nottinghamshire, was visited by <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/education">education</a> watchdog Ofsted on October 17.</p>
      <p>Described by the manager as having a 'homely' atmosphere, the nursery has a team of six nursery staff who care for 39 children up to five years old.</p>
      <p>During their visit, inspectors praised the "passion shown by the manager and staff" and commented on how children spent "as much time as possible learning outside".</p>
      <p>Manager since 2013, Louise Slater has worked her way up from an apprentice when she joined Peapod Nursery in 2004.</p>
      <p>The trained teacher said: "We are based on a smallholding and have beautiful outdoor facilities including a wooded area.</p>
      <p>"We spend a lot of time outside which takes away the boundaries of walls and allows the children more freedom. It shows massive progress in their development."</p>

      <p>The school received an 'outstanding' rating overall, as well as in each individual area. At its previous inspectin it had been rated 'good' overall.</p>
      <p>Ms Slater explained how older children are able to enjoy outdoor cooking around the nursery's fire pit as well as enjoying story times.</p>
      <p>The younger ones take part in mud clay making, collecting sticks for dens and going on book hunts.</p>
      <p>The inspector said: "Children are really excited to visit the 'Forest School' area and get involved in finding insects or toasting marshmallows.</p>
      <p>"Staff take great care to plan the environment so that children can play safely.Children's behaviour is exemplary."</p>
      <p>Ms Slater added that children are also able to help care for some of the nearby farm animals, including their favourite Danny the Donkey, ponies, cows and calves.</p>
      <p>She said: "I think it's important to provide that opportunity. It helps teach them to respect and how to care for animals.</p>
      <p>"They also collect eggs from the hens and we have trips to the cattle market where they can see fresh produce and learn where their food comes from.</p>
      <p>"Some parents have said they love how messy their children get and that they often tell their parents they don't want to come home."</p>

      <p>Staff were also praised for their 'dedication' to the children and how they worked "exceptionally well together".</p>
      <p>The report also highlighted how well staff knew the children adding "they are well-versed in what their children know and are interested in".</p>
      <p>Ms Slater added: "We're a great team and everyone is highly qualified. I have to thank my deputy. It was good to hear that staff felt supported.</p>
      <p>"I was really proud and excited to hear the result, it just doesn't feel real. We all work so hard and it's so nice to be recognised."</p>
