      </p>
      <p>On Monday, reports emerged that Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis was planning to impose harsh economic sanctions on the squad after manager Carlo Ancelotti and his players revolted against him. </p>
      <p>According to <i>AS</i>, the prominent film producer will dish out fines totalling a reported figure of €2.5 million on various squad members after the players refused to attend a training retreat on 5 November. </p>

      </p>
      <p>The latest development comes following numerous instances of strife at the club, which saw De Laurentiis threaten to freeze the players' salaries last month, and which has left Ancelotti's job in the balance. </p>
      <p>The club owner is also reportedly considering selling a host of the club's key players in order to quell the revolt, including the likes of Kalidou Koulibaly, Lorenzo Insigne, Allan, Dries Mertens and Jose Callejon. </p>

      </p>
      <p>As per the reports, De Laurentiis' economic sanctions will range from 25% to 50% of the players' salaries, but the 70-year-old will have to wait for the finding of an independent hearing before taking such drastic steps.</p>
