      <p>OSLO (Dunya News) - Government of Norway has banned desecration of Holy Quran and warned that strict action would be taken if such incidents happened again.</p>
      <p>Authorities said in Norway everyone can avail freedom of speech but within the limits.</p>
      <p>Foreign news agency reported that Norway police have been asked to bar activities hurting religious sentiments of people.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Pakistan lodged a protest with Norway over desecration of the Holy Quran in the Nor¬wegian city of Kristiansand.</p>
      <p>Norwegian Ambassador Kjell-Gunnar Eriksen was summoned to the Foreign Office and conveyed “deep concern of the government and people of Pakistan” over the incident.</p>
      <p>Pakistan urged the ambassador to bring those involved in desecration of the Holy Quran incident to justice and to prevent the recurrence of any such incident in the future.</p>
      <p>Lars Thorsen, a leader of an anti-Islam group, set fire to a copy of the Quran the other day, while another leader of the far-right group Arne Tumyr desecrated two other copies of the holy book by throwing them into a trash bin during a demonstration organised by their organisation.</p>
      <p>Muslims across the world have been praising the Muslim man – now being called the ‘Defender of Quran’ – who attacked Lars Thorsen, the leader of the ‘Stop Islamisation of Norway (SIAN)’, for burning a copy of the Holy Quran during an anti-Islam rally in Norway. The incident happened in the city of Kristiansand despite apparent warnings from local police officials when the anti-Islam group said it planned to do so.</p>
      <p>Ambassador Eriksen, meanwhile, tweeted that Norwegian government “disapproves” the act of the Quran burning in the right-wing demonstration. He said that the police stopped the demonstration “for security reasons”.</p>
      <p>He insisted that in Norway “everyone has the right to free speech and to practice their religion without being harassed”.</p>
