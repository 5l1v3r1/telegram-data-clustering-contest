      <p>Tiffany &amp; Co., the world’s most iconic jeweler, no longer wants to be called a luxury brand.</p>
      <p>“I don’t like the word ‘luxury,'” Tiffany CEO Alessandro Bogliolo said at Bloomberg’s The Year Ahead: Luxury Summit in New York City on Thursday. “Honestly, I try to avoid it.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bloomberglive.com/year-ahead-luxury-2019/#overview">Bloomberg’s second luxury summit</a>, which this year focused on sustainability in the luxury sector, drew power players in the industry such as Tiffany &amp; Co. CEO Alessandro Bogliolo, Rent the Runway cofounder and CEO <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/jennifer-hyman">Jennifer Hyman</a>, legendary architect Robert A.M. Stern, and Klaus Zellmer, president and CEO of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/porsche">Porsche</a> Cars North America.</p>
      <p>The summit came just days before LVMH announced it would be <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lvmh-finalizes-deal-to-buy-tiffany-for-162-billion-2019-11">acquiring</a> Tiffany in a $16.2 billion deal. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiffany-asks-lvmh-to-raise-its-145-billion-offer-sources-2019-11">LVMH first offered to buy the iconic jewelry house</a> last month for $14.5 billion before <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tiffany-m-a-lvmh-exclusive-idUSKBN1XU2PV">upping its offer to $16 billion</a>, Reuters reported Thursday.</p>
      <p>Bogliolo said he prefers the word “legendary” when talking about the jewelry company.</p>
      <p>“I like to define Tiffany as a legendary brand because it’s a brand that really has become a legend,” he said.</p>

      <p>Bogliolo is not the only executive in the luxury industry who’s opposed to the word “luxury.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://skift.com/2019/03/26/the-luxury-travel-industrys-most-overused-buzzwords/">“If you define yourself as luxury</a>, you’re not luxury,” Jacques-Olivier Chauvin, the CEO of Fauchon Hospitality, who previously worked at Louis Vuitton, told travel publication Skift earlier this year.</p>
      <p>In fact, the word was banned at Louis Vuitton, Chauvin said.</p>
      <p>“Sales people were not allowed to use that word,” he told Skift. “We wanted them to focus on creativity, legacy, quality.”</p>
      <p>The concept of luxury seems to have an ever-changing definition these days. According to Boglioli, younger generations have a different approach to the concept of luxury than their older counterparts.</p>

      <p>“I’m a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/baby-boomers">baby boomer</a> and when I was young, for me it was to buy a strong brand, a famous brand, and the beautiful product. That was it. There were no other questions,” he said at the Bloomberg summit. “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/millennials">Millennials</a>, they have much more questions that come even before that. They want to know why Tiffany’s famous, what do they stand for, why should they go to them?”</p>
      <p>Indeed, millennials are more selective with what they buy. For one thing, they’re more willing to spend more money on products that are good for the planet: A 2015 Nielsen poll found that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-spend-more-money-on-things-that-are-good-for-the-planet-2018-4">73% of millennials are willing to pay extra</a> for sustainable products.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rich-millennials-redefining-luxury-experiences-fashion-influencers-2019-4">Millennials also prefer to spend their money on experiences</a> rather than physical objects, Business Insider’s Hillary Hoffower reported, which is perhaps part of the reason why <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/29/business/tiffany-lvmh-millennials/index.html">Tiffany has struggled to attract millennials</a>.</p>
      <p>The jewelry giant’s CEO was tight-lipped about a potential deal at the Bloomberg event on Thursday, just days before LVMH announced the deal was finalized. When asked about the deal, Boglioli evaded the questions by cracking jokes.</p>
      <p>Tiffany is LVMH’s largest <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lvmh-offers-to-buy-tiffany-2010-10">acquisition</a> ever, but it isn’t the conglomerate’s only jewelry brand. <a href="https://www.lvmh.com/houses/watches-jewelry/">LVMH owns French jeweler Chaumet</a>, Swiss watchmakers TAG Heuer and Hublot, and Italian jewelry company Bulgari. Since LVMH bought Bulgari in 2011, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/tiffanyis-worth-the-16-billion-extravagance/2019/11/21/a9aa991e-0c51-11ea-8054-289aef6e38a3_story.html">sales at the Italian jeweler have more than doubled</a>, according to the Washington Post.</p>
