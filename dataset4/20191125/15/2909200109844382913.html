      <p>According to the NDC General Secretary Johnson Asiedu Nketiah, Mr. Daniel Domelovo will be made to step aside based on a petition to be submitted by Pro-NPP group the Alliance for Accountable Government (AFAG).</p>
      <p>Mr Asiedu Nketiah said “as part of elaborate and larger plot to remove” Mr Domelevo, the NDC has information that the Alliance for Accountable Governance (AFAG) and New Patriotic Party (NPP) offshoots “would in the coming days petition President Akufo-Addo for the removal of the Auditor-General, instead of the prosecution of real culprits, Mr Osafo Maafo.”</p>
      <p>The NDC was of the opinion that Mr. Domelovo’s fight to retrieve monies paid to Kroll Associates by Senior Minister Osafo Maafo is what has triggered the decision to remove him.</p>
      <p>“President Akufo-Addo would in-turn be all too happy to act and ask the Auditor-General to step aside. That is the plot ahead of us unless we speak, the object is to release pressure on Osafo Maafo and prevent Domelevo from doing further work on the Kroll and Associates and surcharge Mr Osafo Maafo” Asiedu Nketia added.</p>
      <p>So far, major civil society groups in Ghana have backed the work of the Auditor General.</p>
