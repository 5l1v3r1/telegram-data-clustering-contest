      <h1>Joshua visits match venue for Ruiz rematch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:15:59+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>Anthony Joshua has had his first look at the 16,000-seater purpose-built arena in Saudi Arabia, which will host his world title rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr.</p>
      <p>Joshua’s clash with Ruiz Jr will be for the WBA, WBO and IBF world heavyweight titles he lost to the Mexican back in June at Madison Square Garden.</p>
      <p>Ruiz Jr knocked Joshua down on four occasions en route to a seventh-round TKO in New York in one of the biggest shocks in boxing history.</p>
      <p>But in just under two weeks time on the outskirts of Saudi’s capital Riyadh, Joshua will attempt to win his belts back.</p>
      <p>Ruiz Jr headed out to the Middle East earlier this week to begin final preparations for the huge heavyweight clash.</p>
      <p>And earlier, AJ arrived and immediately visited the arena which will hold 16,000 fans on December 7.</p>
      <p>Eddie Hearn tweeted: “AJ touches down in Saudi! @diriyahseason @skysportsboxing @dazn_usa,” alongside a video of Joshua overlooking the stadium.</p>
      <p>Joshua said earlier this week on his preparations: “We haven’t done anything differently mentally, I am a champion. I walked into the gym and three years later I was Olympic champion.</p>
      <p>“I have had one loss but I am not about to become a p*ssy overnight and not be able to fight.</p>
      <p>“I can fight, that is it, I don’t need to reflect on that, I just need to win.”</p>
      <p>Ruiz Jr came out in the first fight with his fast hands and stunned a slow and lethargic Joshua.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think he’s going to try, how can I say this, go head-to-head with me. But if he does, even better,” Ruiz Jr said.</p>
      <p>The event is expected to be a sell-out in the desert, with promoter Hearn confirming that 6,000 Brits are travelling to the showpiece.</p>
      <p>Joshua is hoping to become a two-time world heavyweight champion, the first Englishman to do so since Lennox Lewis did in the 1990s.</p>
