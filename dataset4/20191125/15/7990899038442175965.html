      <p>The federal judge who presided over the criminal trial of <b>Roger Stone</b> <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000016e-a35d-d7bf-abff-e3dd40700000">released a written copy of her decision</a> denying the longtime <b>Donald Trump</b> confidant and political operative’s motion for acquittal.</p>
      <p>A jury found Stone <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/breaking-roger-stone-found-guilty-of-all-criminal-counts/">guilty</a> of obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and lying to federal investigators (seven counts total) on Nov. 15, after a trial that lasted just a week and a half.</p>
      <p>After completing Stone’s legal defense, his attorneys claimed he was legally entitled to an acquittal, arguing the government failed to prove that either<b> Jerome Corsi </b>or<b> Randy Credico</b> acted as intermediaries between Stone and<b> Julian Assange</b> or WikiLeaks.</p>
      <p>U.S. District Judge <b>Amy Berman Jackson</b> on Monday released the eight-page decision denying the motion, reasoning that the government had provided sufficient evidence for a “rational trier of fact” to find Stone guilty on all seven counts with which he had been charged and found guilty. Jackson promised to release a written copy of the decision which she had already read from the bench.</p>
      <p>Jackson wrote that Counts 2-7, which all dealt with Stone lying to federal investigators, were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
      <p>“With respect to Count 2, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude that the defendant knowingly and willfully made a material false statement in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1001 and 2 when he testified falsely before [the House Intelligence Committee] on September 26, 2017 that ‘he did not have emails with third parties about the head of [WikiLeaks], and that he did not have any documents, emails, or text messages that refer to [Julian Assange],’” she wrote.</p>
      <p>Jackson also said that testimony provided by other former Trump associates was sufficient Stone had lied to Congress.</p>
      <p>“[T]here was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude, based on the testimony of both <b>Steven Bannon </b>and<b> Richard Gates</b>, that the defendant knowingly and willfully made a material false statement in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1001 and 2 when he testified falsely before [the House Intel Committee] on September 26, 2017 that ‘he had never discussed his conversations with the person he referred to as his ‘go-between,’ ‘mutual friend,’ and ‘intermediary’ with anyone involved in the Trump Campaign.’”</p>
      <p>Regarding Count 1, obstruction of justice, Jackson laid out a laundry list of Stone’s verifiably false statements and attempts to get witness Randy Credico to go along with his concocted story.</p>
      <p>“[H]e testified falsely and misleadingly at a House Permanent Subcommittee on Intelligence hearing on September 26, 2017; he lied about the existence of responsive records in response to HPSCI’s requests about documents; and/or he attempted to have Randy Credico testify falsely before HPSCI or to prevent him from testifying,” Jackson wrote.</p>
