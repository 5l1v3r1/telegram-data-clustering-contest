      <h1>Lathe to the rescue – dual drive extruder issue fixed for 3d printer</h1>

        <b>I have had an <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/blogs/engineer-in-wonderland/3d-printing-i-think-i-discovered-folk-trouble-dual-drive-extruders-2019-11/">issue with an otherwise well-made ‘dual-drive’ extruder</a>, bought for my 3D printer.</b>

      </figure>
      <p>In a nutshell, a roller bearing is being asked to use an M3 screw (left) as an inner race. As this M3 thread is only 2.8mm in diameter, the rotor can move around. And with its small contact area, the thread will rapidly wear down.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.electronicsweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/25142215/DualDrive-original-screw-675.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Also, while the left hand end screws into an M3 threaded hole in the structure (photo right), the right hand end passes though an (unseen) oversized (~3.3mm) hole – leaving the screw head end un-supported and somewhat flex-y – particularly as the screw cannot be fully tightened (see below).</p>
      <p>So I treated myself to buying some bits and making time to work on a better solution – or so I claim.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.electronicsweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/25142214/DualDrive-diy-spindle-loose-598.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Here it is (left): a short length of 3mm silver steel (which comes accurately ground to size), tapped to M3 at one end – with the die reversed to remove any taper from the thread so it can screw all the way in.</p>
      <p>The end that needs to fit in the enlarged hole is fattened-up with brass – by reaming a 3mm hole in a lump of brass, epoxy-ing the brass over the silver steel, then turning the brass down to 3.35mm.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Now installed (right) the parallel brass end is free to slide within the right hand support so the new bolt can be fully tightened without trapping the rotating part between the end supports and jamming it.</p>
      <p>This potential for jamming was the reason the original bolt could not be tightened properly.</p>
      <p>‘Fully tightened’ should be taken with a pinch of salt as it is only thread-binding that is stopping rotation. Maybe ‘reasonably snugged’ would be a better expression.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Here (left) is the whole thing assembled and greased, with no perceptible end-float or side-play – a tribute to the precision of the original parts (let down by mis-use of that M3 screw).<br/>The lovely length fit emphasises how easily tightening the original bolt trapped the rotor.</p>
      <p>The brassy end of the custom bolt was deliberately left long, just in case a head needed to be bonded over it.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>BTW: neither the silver steel nor the reamer were very expensive – £5 probably covered both of them – and look how precise the fit was (right) – after turning on the lathe, that remnant of brass is only 150μm thick.<br/>The evenness of the brass layer is a tribute to the quality of the little lathe I was using, and the scoring of the brass surface says a lot about my poor turning technique…</p>
