      <h1>"My Children Went to Public Schools": Is Warren Telling the Truth?</h1>
      <h2>Didn't her son go to an elite private school?</h2>

      <p>Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren denied sending her children to private schools, despite the fact that she sent her son to an elite private school.</p>
      <p>When <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/11/21/elizabeth-warren-charter-school-protesters/">school choice activists</a> confronted her after a campaign rally Thursday, Warren said her children didn’t go to private schools.</p>
      <p>“We are going to have the same choice that you had for your kids, because I read that your children went to private schools,” one activist told Warren. “No, my children went to public schools,” the Massachusetts senator replied.</p>

      <p>But publicly available records show Warren, who has pledged to crack down on school choice if elected, chose to send her son Alexander to Kirby Hall, an elite private school in the Austin area, <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/10/29/elizabeth-warren-charter-schools-son-private-school/">as the Daily Caller News Foundation previously reported</a>. Kirby Hall’s <a href="https://www.classmates.com/siteui/yearbooks/107195?page=25">1987 yearbook</a> lists Alexander Warren among the school’s fifth-graders.</p>
      <p>Alexander, like most fifth-graders that year, turned 11 in 1987, public records accessed through the research service LexisNexis show. That coincided with Warren’s final year teaching at the University of Texas at Austin, which is located a short drive from the elite private school.</p>
      <p>Warren’s campaign told the Washington Free Beacon on Friday that despite the senator’s denial, she did in fact send her son to private school.</p>
      <p>“Elizabeth’s daughter went to public school. Her son went to public school until 5th grade,” Kristen Orthman, communications director for the Warren campaign, <a href="https://freebeacon.com/politics/video-warren-confronted-by-school-choice-activist-over-sending-son-to-private-school/">told the Free Beacon</a>.</p>
      <p>The group of parent activists interrupted a <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/10/15/elizabeth-warren-taxes-middle-class/">Warren</a> campaign rally in Atlanta on Thursday with chants of “Our children, our choice!” and “We want to be heard!”</p>
