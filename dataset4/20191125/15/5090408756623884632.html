      <p>Northern cities like Anchorage, Buffalo, and Minneapolis are known for their punishing winters. But the US has dozens of cities and many more small towns where the season is just as bad – or worse.</p>
      <p>Some experience plunging temperatures far below freezing, or hundreds of inches of snowfall, or months with barely any sunshine. Others have ice-storms that coat entire cities in inches of slippery ice.</p>
      <p>Here are 28 places with some of the harshest winters in America.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Anchorage, Alaska, gets 74.5 inches of snow per year on average. The record fall was 133 inches in 2012. It remains below freezing for most of winter, and on top of that, it gets about 20 days where temperatures fall below 0 degrees Fahrenheit.</h3>

      <h3>The average high in Boston, Massachusetts, is only 38 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter months. Usually it has 22 days that never get above freezing. In 2015, four blizzards in three weeks caused so much snowfall that the city had to spend $35 million to remove it. That winter clocked in 108.6 inches of snow. Harsh winters have also damaged public utilities like ferry docks and gas lines.</h3>
