      <h1>Thieves steal 18th-century jewellery in Dresden museum heist</h1>
      <h2>Pieces of ‘incalculable cultural value’ taken from Saxon royal collection</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:57:36+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:57</time> by <a rel="author">Tobias Buck</a></address>
      <p>Police in Dresden are investigating one of the most audacious museum heists in recent years, after thieves broke into the city’s historic Green Vault and stole as many as 100 pieces of 18th-century jewellery from the Saxon royal collection.</p>
      <p>Dirk Syndram, the director of the Green Vault collection, refused to give an estimate of how much the stolen items were worth but said they were of “incalculable cultural value”.</p>
      <p>According to the Dresden police, the thieves cut away a lattice of iron bars and smashed through a window before entering the jewellery room, one of a suite of opulent Baroque apartments that house the most precious pieces of the royal collection.</p>
      <p>They then broke open one of the display cabinets, and took two “jewel garnitures” — sets of 37 diamonds each cut and crafted into buttons, brooches and other matching ornaments. A smaller set of 20 pieces fashioned out of diamonds and pearls was also stolen.</p>
      <p>Police were alerted to the break-in shortly before 5am on Monday, after the museum’s security team spotted two people entering the Vault on their camera feed. A police car was at the scene within minutes, but the suspects had already made their escape.</p>
      <p>Volker Lange, the head of the Dresden criminal investigation department, said the raid happened shortly after a fire destroyed a nearby electricity installation, cutting the local power supply. There had been no street lighting at the time, Mr Lange added.</p>

      <p>Marion Ackermann, the director-general of the Dresden state art collections, said the pieces were almost certainly too well-known to sell on the open market. Asked whether the diamond sets could be broken up and sold individually, Ms Ackermann said: “That would be terrible to imagine.”</p>
      <p>The historic Green Vault is home to one of the most famous and extravagant royal collections in Europe, with more than 3,000 objects on show. Assembled during the reign of August the Strong, the ruler of Saxony from 1694 to 1733, the collection includes a vast array of mostly Baroque artworks made of gold, silver, ivory and amber.</p>
      <p>The jewellery room, which was the only room targeted during Monday’s raid, houses hundreds of diamonds, rubies, emeralds and other precious stones, as well as elaborate sculptures made of gold and jewels. Visitors have to enter the Green Vault display rooms through an airlock.</p>
      <p>The royal treasury was built by August the Strong, one of the most ambitious patrons of the art of his time, between 1723 and 1730. Reopened after extensive restoration works in 2006, the Green Vault was used as the backdrop for a meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and US president Barack Obama in 2009. </p>
      <p>Michael Kretschmer, the prime minister of Saxony, said the thieves had stolen not only from state art collection “but from us Saxons”. He added: “The treasures that can be found inside the Green Vault and the royal palace are the product of hard work over many centuries by the people of the free state of Saxony.” </p>
      <p>Monday’s raid was the second high-profile heist suffered by a landmark German museum in recent years. A group of thieves broke into Berlin’s Bode Museum in early 2017 and stole an oversized gold coin weighing 100 kilogrammes. The coin, estimated to be worth €3.75m at the time, has never reappeared, prompting speculation that it may have been melted down by the perpetrators.</p>
