      </p>
      <p>Throughout years, many pain relief medications have been introduced in the market, which sometimes cheat the consumers with false hopes and expectations. Meanwhile, many eminent celebrities of Bollywood often promote and endorse some of these products which most of the time they do not have any understanding of. Recently, in a five years old case, Bollywood actors Govinda and Jackie Shroff have been fined with Rs 20,000 for endorsing a pain relief oil. According to reports, the oil-producing company has also been fined by the court along with the products.</p>
      <p>A consumer court in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh has forced a fine of Rs 20,000 on Bollywood actors Govinda and Jackie Shroff for promoting a pain relief oil along with the producing company. According to a report in IANS, the UP court verdict was passed on a complaint filed by youth about five years back against a herbal oil company and the celebrity brand ambassadors of the company. As per the complaint of the youth, the oil that was promoted by the actors Govinda and Jackie Shroff did not give relief from the pain in 15 days as stated in the advertisement. The UP based lawyer, Abhinav, who lodged the complaint, shared that he purchased the product as the celebrities Govinda and Jackie Shroff promoted it and the company promised a full relief in 15 days from the pain. As everything turned out to be a hoax, Abhinav then went on to lodge the complaint with the consumer court.

      <p>In July 2012, the youth Abhinav Agarwal, a lawyer based in Muzaffarnagar, UP, ordered a pain relief oil for his 70-year-old father Brijbhushan Agarwal for the cost of Rs 3, 600 on seeing the advertisement in the newspaper which promised a full refund of the amount if the person using it fails to get the necessary relief in 15 days. As there was no relief from the pain even after 10 days of using the oil, Abhinav Agarwal got in touch with the company representative of the Madhya Pradesh based company, who informed him to return the product for processing the refund amount. As the company failed to refund the amount paid during the purchase, the company also started harassing the consumer when he contacted them time and again.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the consumer court has now ordered all the five stakeholders including the company, Govinda, Jackie Shroff, Telemart Shopping Network Pvt Limited and Max Communications to make a payment of Rs 20, 000 as a return to the Agrawal for the fraud. The court also ordered the firm to initiate a return of Rs 3,600 paid by the victim with an interest of 9 percent per year along with the compensation of other legal expenses.</p>
