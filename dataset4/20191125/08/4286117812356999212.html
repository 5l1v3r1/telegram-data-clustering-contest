      <p>Elephants are intelligent animals and there are innumerable videos on the Internet to prove the same. Remember the viral video of an <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/trending-news/story/elephant-pulls-down-wooden-pole-to-cross-electric-fence-in-viral-video-internet-is-impressed-1615961-2019-11-05">elephant pulling down a wooden electric fence</a> to cross over to the forest?</p>
      <p>Another video of an elephant breaking electric fence is also leaving the Internet in awe of the animal’s intelligence.</p>
      <p>The video was shared online by Twitter user Dr. PM Dhakate with the caption, "Gajraj, The Elephant, is one of the most intelligent animals in the animal kingdom. An amazing video, showing how the elephant first checks for electricity flowing in the wires, breaks two barriers, keeping itself safe in the process and thereby dispersing in the forest!"</p>
      <p>
        <b>Watch the video here:</b>

      <p>In the video, one can see how the elephant first checks with its foot if it can get an electric shock by lightly touching the wires. After checking for electricity, it then pushes down the wooden pole and even tries to throw a thick wood piece to break the barrier.</p>
      <p>After it manages to pull down the pole, the animal then crosses the road to get to the other end and there too, breaks the electric fencing to get inside teh forest. The viral video has left the Internet stunned.</p>
      <p>After the video was shared on Twitter, it was viewed over 1.8k times and garnered over 237 likes. While some netizens praised the animal’s efforts to cross the fence intelligently, some criticised how humans have encroached their space.</p>
