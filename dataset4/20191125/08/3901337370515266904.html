      <p>No matter how far you are on a wrong track, make a u-turn. Eric Tinkler took Maritzburg United from the clutches of relegation to being league cup finalists<br/><br/>After spending most part of the 2018/19 season at basement of the Absa Premiership log standings, Maritzburg needed play-offs to save their league status. When you are down, the only way you can go is up and coach Eric Tinkler is leading Maritzburg to glory days. The Pietermaritzburg outfit is doing amazing things. Reaching their second cup final in over a decade is already an achievement for The Team of Choice.<br/><br/>Farouk Kadioka is reaping the rewards of appointing the former Bafana Bafana midfield anchor as a coach of his club. Maritzburg already has a medal amid reaching the Telkom Knockout finals, what's left is for them to choose a colour. Tinkler is tactically astute and his coaching skills is unquestionable. Beating Chiefs doesn't make Maritzburg automatic champions. There is still a mountain to climb for the team from the Kwa Zulu-Natal capital.<br/><br/>Maritzburg will have to beat Mamelodi Sundowns to be crowned TKO champions. Sundowns boasts international stars at their disposal and know how to win titles but that won't scare off Maritzburg as they managed to put Chiefs to the sword. The Team of Choice has no choice but to bring their A-game to the finals on the 14th of December.<br/><br/>Maritzburg United’s U-turn not a fluke but the amount of work the club has been putting it. Applaud Tinkler for his dedication and hard work.</p>
