      <p>PORTO ALEGRE: International's hopes of qualifying for next year’s Copa Libertadores tournament took a dent on Sunday (Nov 24) after they could only draw 2-2 at home to Fortaleza.</p>
      <p>The result leaves Inter in seventh place in the Serie A table, with the first six teams qualifying for the Libertadores, the South American version of the Champions League. Four games of the season remain.</p>

      <p>Paolo Guerrero scored in the 43rd and 83rd minutes for Inter, both times to equalise, as the home recovered from twice being behind.</p>
      <p>Osvaldo had put Fortaleza 1-0 up after eight minutes and then Tinga put them ahead again 72 minutes into the second half.</p>
      <p>Bruno Melo had a chance to give the visitors all three points but he saw his stoppage time penalty saved.</p>
      <p>Flamengo won the title earlier on Sunday when their closest challengers Palmeiras were beaten 2-1 by Gremio. The result left Flamengo an unassailable 13 points clear at the top of the table, with only four games remaining.</p>
