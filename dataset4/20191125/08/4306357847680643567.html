      <h3>Manchester United are readying a £50m offer to sign Roma midfielder Nicolo Zaniolo, according to a report in Italy.</h3>
      <p>Italian media outlet <i>Il Messaggero</i>, as quoted by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10411030/man-utd-battle-psg-50m-roma-nicolo-zaniolo/">The Sun</a>, is reporting that the Red Devils are interested in a potential swoop to sign the 20-year-old.</p>
      <p>The same article states that Manchester United would have to pay around £50m to win the race to sign Zaniolo amid interest from Paris Saint-Germain.</p>
      <p>According to the same story, Manchester United sent scouts to watch the Italian prospect in action for AS Roma ahead of a potential bid.</p>
      <p>The report suggests that the good relationship between Manchester United and AS Roma after Chris Smalling’s loan deal could work in the Premier League side’s favour in their bid to sign Zaniolo.</p>
      <p>PSG are thought to be preparing a bid in the January transfer window but Manchester United would rather sign the Italy international next summer, the story continues.</p>
      <p>The <i>Sun</i> report adds that the AS Roma star is a big fan of Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford.</p>
      <p>Manchester United have been without club-record signing Paul Pogba for most of the Premier League season so far.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils have relied heavily on Scotland international Scott McTominay to be the driving force in their midfield after selling Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini during 2019.</p>
