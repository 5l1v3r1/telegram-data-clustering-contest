      <h1>'1917' Draws Overwhelming Acclaim on Twitter: 'Stunning on Every Level'</h1>
      <h2>Expect Sam Mendes’ war film to earn multiple Oscar nominations</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:17:49+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/jeremy-fuster/" target="_blank">Jeremy Fuster</a></address>
      <p>If the social media reaction coming out of the first round of screenings for “1917” is any indication, Sam Mendes has made a World War I film for the ages.</p>
      <p>While full reviews won’t hit the internet until Monday afternoon, attendees of press screenings in Los Angeles and New York were free to post their thoughts on Universal’s upcoming epic. Featuring the cinematography of “Blade Runner 2049” Oscar winner Roger Deakins, “1917” follows two British soldiers tasked to save their fellow men from an ambush in a race against time.</p>
      <p>Universal has heavily promoted Mendes and Deakins’ choice to film the entire movie as if it was one continuous take, similar to Alejandro Inarritu and Emmanuel Lubezki’s work on “Birdman.”</p>

      <p>“From the second ‘1917’ starts to the final frame, it’s a total immersion into another time and place and it’s just a stunning movie on every level,” Collider Editor-in-Chief <a href="https://twitter.com/colliderfrosty/status/1198695908570890240">Steven Weintraub</a> wrote. “Another 2019 film that absolutely blew me away. See this on the biggest screen you can.”</p>
      <p>Podcaster <a href="https://twitter.com/NextBestPicture">Matt Neglia</a> called the film “THE technical achievement of 2019.”</p>
      <p>“We’re with these men through every footstep &amp; it’s unlike any war film you’ve ever seen before,” he wrote. “Epic &amp; tense direction by Sam Mendes, emotional &amp; exhilarating music from Thomas Newman &amp; an all timer from cinematographer Roger Deakins.”</p>
      <p>“I was skeptical of the ‘one continuous shot’ aspect,” UPROXX critic <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeryan/status/1198345224294207490">Mike Ryan</a> wrote.  “Worried it would get too cute with it, but it really works for this story, putting us right there in this hell.”</p>
      <p>“1917” will be released in select cities on Christmas Day with a wide release set for Jan. 10. See more reactions below.</p>

          <figcaption>The 91st Academy Awards may not have had a host, but the 3 hour, 17 minute-long show was filled with plenty of heartwarming <i>and</i> gut-wrenching moments. Here, TheWrap rounds up the 11 best and worst bits of the 2019 Oscars.<cite>Getty</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>BEST/WORST: The Host-Less Opening -- </b>It's not your fault, Adam Lambert. It's just that it's weird to hear anyone sing "We Are the Champions" that isn't Freddie Mercury. (Maybe a pass for now: Oscar winner Rami Malek?)  Meanwhile, Amy Poehler, Tina Fey and Maya Rudolph made their best pitch to be next year's Oscars hosts, and we hope the Academy was listening.<cite>Getty Images</cite></figcaption>

Hey, even if you’ve re-watched that scene from the movie a million times already, it was nice just to take another look at them. Oh, and then the song won an Oscar later in the evening, making this moment even more perfect.<cite>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</cite></figcaption>

These two very funny people had a very funny, joint on-stage panic attack while recapping how starstruck they were hanging out backstage, rubbing elbows with the other A-list presenters.<cite>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</cite></figcaption>

Let's just say there are few ways to upstage Bette Midler, but that was one of them.<cite>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</cite></figcaption>

It looks like the In Memoriam segment -- which left out Sondra Locke, Verne Troyer, Dick Miller and R. Lee Ermey -- was where they did it.<cite>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>BEST: Oscars Show Stays Pretty Close to Its 3-Hour Runtime Pledge</b> -- No bloated opening monologue and a much tighter show (with a shaved-down In Memoriam segment) helped the Academy stick very close to its goal of a three-hour night, with Sunday's telecast coming in at just 17 minutes over, despite airing all 24 awards live.<cite>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</cite></figcaption>

This was made all the worse by Mahershala Ali winning an Oscar for playing him. <cite>Getty</cite></figcaption>
