      <p>Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam said on Monday that she respects the result of the district council election, vowing that she would listen “humbly” to the public’s views and reflect on her administration’s shortcomings.</p>
      <p>“There are various analyses and interpretations in the community in relation to the results, and quite a few are of the view that the results reflect people’s dissatisfaction with the current situation and the deep-seated problems in society,” Lam said in a statement after the pro-establishment camp suffered a humiliating defeat in the local body elections. </p>
      <p>The government will “listen to the opinions of members of the public humbly and seriously reflect,” the chief executive said.</p>
      <p>Noting that Sunday’s elections took place in the wake of months of social unrest, Lam thanked all candidates for “fearlessly” taking part in the polls.</p>
      <p>She also thanked the Electoral Affairs Commission as well as over 30,000 civil servants for doing everything they could to ensure a smooth polling process.</p>
      <p>The comments came after Sunday’s election shocker, which saw pro-democracy candidates winning around 390 of the 452 district council seats amid a historic turnout.</p>
      <p>Widely considered a referendum on the Lam administration and its handling of the months-long social unrest in the city, the election results could add to the pressure on Lam to reconsider her stance in relation to meeting some of the protesters’ demands.  </p>
      <p>China’s foreign ministry, asked about the election, said stopping violence and restoring order in Hong Kong is the paramount task. <i><b>With Reuters and RTHK</b></i></p>
