      <p>realme just announced its flagship-tier device, the <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/196442/realme-x2-pro-official-64mp/">X2 Pro</a>, about a month ago. Now, with the teaser for a realme X50 5G, it looks like the company is taking a step into the realm of 5G as well. FoneArena reports that Xu Qi Chase, CMO of realme China, posted on his Weibo account a teaser of the phone.</p>
      <p>On the post itself, he breaks down the reason behind the name X50. Based on the post, X will generally represent realme’s flagship devices, while 5 stands for 5G. The 0 is a little abstract, but it essentially marks the year the company kickstarts its 5G efforts.</p>

      <p>The teaser image itself also says that the realme X50 will support standaline and non-standaline sub-6GHz 5G tech. As for the phone itself, the image shows what could either be a dual rear camera setup, or a dual punch-hole front-facing cameras.</p>
      <p>That’s about it as far as information for the phone goes. That said, FoneArena also says that realme intendo to launch the X50 5G in China soon, but stopped short of mentioning a specific date. If he launch is indeed soon, then we won’t have long to wait before we know more about the realme X50 5G.</p>
