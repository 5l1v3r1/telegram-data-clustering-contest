      <h1>Man Utd identify potential 'problem' in Erling Braut Haaland transfer deal</h1>
      <h2>The Premier League giants look to have suffered a potential setback in their efforts to sign the talented Norwegian teen</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:54:37+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:54</time> by <a rel="author">Ned Keating</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> have reportedly uncovered an issue that could scupper their plans to move for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/red-bull-salzburg">Red Bull Salzburg</a> sensation <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/erling-braut-haaland">Erling Braut Haaland</a> in January.</p>
      <p>The talented teenager has been linked with string of Europe's top clubs after netting 23 goals in 19 games since joining the Austrian side in the summer.</p>
      <p>With Utd having managed just the seventh-most goals in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/premier-league">Premier League</a> so far this term, it is thought the Old Trafford hierarchy are keen on bolstering their attacking options in January.</p>
      <p>The urgency for reinforcements up top has also been hastened by the failure to replace <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/romelu-lukaku">Romelu Lukaku</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/alexis-sanchez">Alexis Sanchez</a> after the pair left to join <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/inter-milan">Inter Milan</a> in the summer.</p>

      <p>Haaland is seen as a player who could help alleviate Utd's attacking problems, but The Athletic's David Ornstein reports the English titans are not looking forward to dealing with the Norwegian's agent, Mino Raiola.</p>
      <p>And it seems that is something that could impact on a move for Haaland, with the Red Devils and the 'super agent' having previously clashed in the past.</p>
      <p>"The current state of their relationship with Raiola is unclear and for all the suggestions that they are reticent to do business with him after their dealings over Paul Pogba, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, there are counterclaims that the two parties remain on good terms," wrote Ornstein</p>

      <p>"But, either way, sources admit his involvement is a complicating factor and, given there are guaranteed to be a huge number of suitors for Haaland, that is not ideal for United’s hopes."</p>
      <p>The news that Utd will have to deal with Raiola comes just hours after they suffered another blow in their pursuit of Haaland.</p>
      <p>It came out over the weekend that RB Leipzig have first refusal over signing Haaland from their fellow Red Bull-branded club for a fee of just £25.7m.</p>
