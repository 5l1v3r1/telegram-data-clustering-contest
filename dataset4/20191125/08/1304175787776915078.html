      <p>CAPE TOWN – <b>The Rockefeller</b> is set to be a storied establishment and an icon of contemporary elegance in the mother city. The hotel – that will be managed by <b>Newmark Hotels, Reserves, Lodges and Residences</b> – is designed to encapsulate the essence of the city’s tempo – making it the quintessential residence to live, work and </p>
      <p>Avant-garde and polished, The Rockefeller will be urban luxury at its best – emanating glamour from the moment guests step into its cavernous lobby. Once inside, The Rockefeller seeks to offer a sense of privacy and sanctuary only accorded to those on the inside of its big, glass doors. Harmonised with on-trend decor and effortless style, this hotel is bound to be a plush oasis set in the sprawling Cape Town metropolis.</p>
      <p>The 300-room hotel is designed to deliver exceptional experiences for its guests and residents, including a sparkling rooftop pool with unrivalled views overlooking the mother city and its imposing guardian, Table Mountain. Impeccably appointed, lavish decor accents will offer guests a stately refuge from the inner-city bustle. A meticulous design that epitomises the city’s penchant for cosmopolitan fashion will be central to its sleek, modern aesthetic that will further add to its wholly regal setting.</p>
      <p>Once completed, The Rockefeller, seeks to redefine the Cape Town hotel landscape with its exceptional full-scale amenities and services. These will include a laundry service, all-day dining, a coffee bar, deli, bike room, conference facility, resident DJ and a fully-equipped gym. The anticipated on-site spa will fit in seamlessly with the hotel’s distinction and guests can expect best-in-class restorative treatments and experiences for optimal relaxation and bliss.</p>
      <p>The exquisite rooftop pool will provide guests with a scenic perch to nestle and soak up the illuminated city vistas and striking Table Mountain in the nearby distance. The hotel is designed to offer guests a discerning stay – all within reach of the city’s best restaurants, boutique stores and cultural attractions.</p>
      <p>Says MD of Newmark Hotels, Reserves, Lodges and Residences, <b>Neil Markovitz</b>,<i> “As our other properties will showcase, our continuous pursuit for a distinction once again saw us benchmarking our concept and design against global best practices. We wanted to bring contemporary city living and amenities to guests without them having to leave the hotel. Whether it’s deluxe pampering or sumptuous breakfasts, lunches, dinners or cocktails – The Rockefeller guest will always only be a few short steps away from these and other premium amenities and services.”</i></p>
      <p>Urban luxury is closer than you think – hotel reservations commence at the start of 2021.</p>
