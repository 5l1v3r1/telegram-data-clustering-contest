      <p>Controversial Private Legal Practitioner, Maurice Ampaw is calling on the security agencies to arrest and permanently cage the leader of the Homeland Study Group, Charles Kormi Kudzordzi alias Papavi Hogbedetor.</p>
      <p>He avers that the man at the centre of the declaration of the Independence for Western Togoland is a dangerous character and should not be dealt with lightly .</p>
      <p>To him, once he is arrested, the security agencies must ensure he remains behind bars and fed with only mashed kenkey and salt until the final determination of the matter by the courts.</p>
      <p>Lawyer Maurice Ampaw believes he is more dangerous than the suspected coupists yet has been given room to operate by the security agencies and government in view of his old age.</p>
      <p>“People are sympathizing with him because of his old age but he is not to be toyed with. Do you know that there are some criminals who use children to operate? They train children to engage in burglary. Forget about age and remember the law is no respecter of persons. He very dangerous and conceiving an evil plot”, he said.</p>
      <p>According to him, he should not be treated with kid gloves and must also not be granted bail once he is arrested; because he is not such a person to be shown some leniency in view of his age.</p>
      <p>“We should not be deceived by his age. Such an evil person who is inching close 90 years and intend to create confusion must immediately be dealt with. We cannot keep mute and allow him to take the security of the country for granted”, he stated on Kumasi-based Otec Fm monitored by <a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/">MyNewsGh.com</a>.</p>
      <p>The Homeland Study Group Foundation declared independence for the Volta, and parts of the Northern, North Eastern and Upper East Regions after its meeting held in Ho a week ago.</p>
      <p>The Ho District Court has however ordered the arrest of the leader of the Homeland Study Group Foundation (HSGF), Charles Kwame Kudzodzi and two others over their unlawful declaration of parts of the Volta Region as a sovereign state.<br/><br/>This was after eleven were arrested and 5 other members of the group were put before court for taking part in the activity.</p>
      <p>The five have been charged with treason and have been remanded into prison custody until December 4, after the prosecution told the court that they would be needed to assist with investigations.</p>
