      <h1>City Of Tshwane Knew Of Mokgalapa’s Leaked ‘Sex’ Audio Clips</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:49:51+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/suzziegitau/" target="_blank">SG Editor</a></address>
      <p>Tshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa on Sunday said he hoped authorities would get to the bottom of the leaked audio recordings, which are at the centre of a filed criminal complaint.</p>
      <p>The City had filed a case of extortion and blackmail following the leak of audio clips, some which allegedly point to an inappropriate relationship between the mayor and his roads and transport MMC Sheila Senkubuge.</p>
      <p>The clip, circulated on social media, purports to be a conversation between the pair and supposedly includes an intimate exchange between them.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the City said it had known about the recordings for a number of days and had received demands for the reinstatements of four top officials.</p>
      <p>Mokgalapa said they had refused to give in to the demands and would not sacrifice their oaths of office.</p>
