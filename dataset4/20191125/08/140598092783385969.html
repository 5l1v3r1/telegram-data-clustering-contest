      <h1>New laws to protect children from online harms pledged in Tory manifesto after Telegraph campaign</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:12:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/charles-hymas/" target="_blank">Charles Hymas</a></address>
      <p>New duty of care laws to make the UK the “safest place in the world” to be online are promised in the Conservative manifesto.</p>
      <p>It follows a campaign by The Daily Telegraph for a statutory duty of care on the tech giants to do more to protect children from online harms ranging from sexual abuse to cyber-bullying.</p>
      <p>The manifesto said the new legislation would not only protect children from online abuse and harms but also ensure there is no safe space for terrorists to hide online.</p>
      <p>However, it also seeks to assuage concerns that such legislation could hamper free speech, saying the Conservatives are committed to “at the same time defending freedom of expression and in particular recognising and defending the invaluable role of a free press.”</p>
      <p>The Government’s White Paper on online harms in the Summer proposed a new regulator to enforce a duty of care, with tech firms’ executives held legally responsible for breaches. </p>
      <p>The watchdog would have powers to fine the companies and potentially shut down services if they ignored requests to take action.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson’s Queen’s Speech confirmed it would develop a draft bill that would be considered by Parliament, probably this Spring, following the results of the consultation on its White Paper.</p>
      <p>The Tories also pledged to review the Gambling Act to focus on tackling loot boxes, in-game purchases that can be won or bought but which have been criticised for encouraging gambling by children, and credit card misuse.</p>
      <p>The manifesto admitted: “Given how the online world is moving, the Gambling Act is increasingly becoming an analogue law in a digital age.”</p>
