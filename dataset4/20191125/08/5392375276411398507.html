      <p>At the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/huawei">Huawei</a> MatePad Pro new product launch this afternoon, Huawei’s consumer business CEO, Yu Chengdong, said that Huawei MediaPad M6 is the best-selling flagship tablet in Huawei’s history. According to him, this year’s shipments will exceed 2 million units. He believes that one of the most important reasons for achieving such results is user satisfaction.</p>

      <p>With the release of the MediaPad M6, Huawei became the top Chinese tablet brand for Q3 2019. Huawei has gained a fair second-half market share under US sanctions. If there are no US sanctions, it should be the first. This is the belief of Yu Chengdong. He added</p>
      <p>“Everyone said that consumers are patriotic to buy our products, but in the first four months of this year, we sold very well in foreign countries. Do foreigners still love China? They must be Huawei products. ”</p>
      <p>Yu Chengdong said that Huawei does not expect good news (US sanctions) and it is preparing for the worst results. This means that if there is good news, Huawei will only be better. The Huawei MediaPad M6 is not the only Huawei device that is doing well in the market. According to Yu Chendong, Huawei Watch GT 2 has sold more than 1 million units worldwide in 45 days.</p>
