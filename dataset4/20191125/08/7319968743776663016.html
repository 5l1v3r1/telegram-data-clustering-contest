      <p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/minnesotan-who-carried-jfks-casket-reflects-on-55th-anniversary/89-615337262">KARE11</a>, retired Coast Guard member Bud Barnum recalled how he helped bring President Kennedy’s casket to the White House, Capitol, church and Arlington National Cemetery.</p>
      <p>Barnum explained how he was chosen to represent his branch of the military, and that he was essentially waiting on a call about the ailing former President Hoover when he was summoned to Andrews Air Base. There, instead, he met the body of the recently assassinated JFK.</p>

      <p>“We stayed with the casket all the time,” Barnum said, except for when the team of himself and seven other pallbearers broke away to practice with a different casket.</p>
      <p>“We put a person on top of the casket, filled the casket with sandbags and practiced carrying up, keep it level,” Barnum said.</p>
      <p>Speaking of the emotional toll of such a duty, Barnum said: “It didn't hit us until it was over.”</p>
      <p>“You do your duty, that's it.”</p>
      <p>Following the funeral proceedings, Barnum said his military base received a number of thank you cards, including one from widow Jackie Kennedy.</p>

      <p>He also received numerous requests for autographs, all of which he responded to.</p>
      <p>Barnum now hopes that upon his own death, he too will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery where President Kennedy now lies.</p>
      <p>“There's not a better place,” says Barnum.</p>
