      <p>Dubbed “McWidow” by Cristina because he lost his wife, the hot new <br/>Irish doctor and Grey have already clashed. Nonetheless, it is apparent Hayes is destined to be Meredith’s newest love interest. </p>
      <p>Dr. Hayes is played by Irish actor Richard Flood. The 37-year-old from Dublin has previously starred in Shameless and TV3’s Red Rock.</p>
      <p>Since the fall finale last week, fans of the show have been taking to social media to share their love for the handsome doctor, <a href="https://www.her.ie/entertainment/fans-swooning-new-irish-doctor-greys-anatomy-489790?fbclid=IwAR1BusoukimqQ1483rmTciMtVPB-6AHXtnG8qmIKpNPFlXQzvUy6paR9fvg">reports Her.ie.</a></p>
