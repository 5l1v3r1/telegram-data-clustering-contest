      <h2>Gregg Wallace and his wife Anna won't be able to have any more children naturally seven months after welcoming their son Sid</h2>

      <p>Gregg Wallace and his wife Anna are coming to terms with not being able to have any more children naturally after doctors recommended she has major surgery - seven months after they welcomed baby son Sid into the world.</p>
      <p>The 54-year-old MasterChef presenter is supporting 33-year-old Anna after she was told she needs a full hysterectomy - the removal of the womb - to prevent the spread of her endometriosis.</p>
      <p>"I've got to have a complete hysterectomy early next year," Anna tells this week's <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/gregg-wallace-wife-anna-hysterectomy-20930793">OK!</a> magazine.</p>

      <p>"My endometriosis, which I've suffered with all my adult life, returned severely after I had Sid. It's so bad I also have to have part of my intestine removed, as it has attacked my bowel too. It causes me a lot of pain. It's a big operation and I'll be in hospital for about ten days with three months recovery."</p>
      <p>Anna has had the condition since the age of 16, and is on painkillers every day to manage the pain.</p>
      <p>Endo, as it is usually called, is where tissue similar to the lining of the womb begins to grow in other places, including the ovaries and fallopian tubes, which can impact on the chances of conceiving a child.</p>

      <p>"After the operation, there's less chance of it coming back again. I just want to get rid of it and recover," Anna went on, adding that she'll be on hormone replacement therapy permanently, as the operation will bring on the menopause.</p>
      <p>"It will be a slow, long recovery but it's great that my mum lives with us full time and she'll be here to help. After my dad sells his business in Coventry, he's going to come and live here too," she adds.</p>
      <p>The couple weren't even sure they could have a baby because of their 21-year age gap and Anna's medical issues, but still managed to have little Sid earlier this year.</p>

      <p>"Having a hysterectomy without having already had a child, would have been horrendous," she says.</p>
      <p>"I'm not looking forward to Anna having the operation, but I'm looking forward to her being out of pain," Gregg adds.</p>
      <p>He already has two grownup kids, 24 year-old Tom and 21 year-old Libby, from his marriage to second wife Denise.</p>

      <p>He and Anna had settled on IVF after years of struggling to conceive, but she managed to fall pregnant naturally after they took a holiday.</p>
      <p>He previously gushed of Sid's birth: "I saw him take his first breath. It was just beautiful. I looked at him and thought he was perfect."</p>
      <p>And he joked last month: "I'm really pleased Anna has had a baby - it's someone at home more her own age to talk to."</p>
