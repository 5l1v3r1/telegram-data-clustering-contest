      <p><a href="http://panl.brtchip.com/">Each system, all branded ‘Panl’</a>, is built around networked displays, with some including protocol-converting hubs and interface boxes.</p>
      <p>At the heart of the displays is the firm’s <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/bridgetek-launches-graphic-controllers-eve-2018-02/">novel graphics controller ICs, branded ‘Eve’</a>.</p>

      <p>PanL Smart Living (PSL)</p>
      <p>Intended for the home automation market, Panel Smart Living has four major devices: a 7in display, a hub to connect the system to multiple networks (including Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Z-Wave, 433MHz, IRDA, and Ethernet), a DALI (and DMX512) box for smart lighting and a relay box for switching other loads.</p>
      <p>“Thanks to its support of a wide range of different wireless and wireline connectivity protocols, Bridgetek’s PSL solution facilitates interaction with all types of automated functions within a domestic context, as well as in offices, hotels and other everyday environments,” according to the firm. “It enables the control of lighting, heating, air conditioning, curtains, blinds, household appliances and door entry mechanisms.”</p>
      <p>Human interaction is via the wall-mounted touch-based display unit, a mobile app, or by voice – via Alexa.</p>
      <p>As well as Alexa, PSL is enabled to interact with home automation systems from Philips (Hue lighting), Heimann, Osram, Daikin, iHorn, EuChips, DMX, Somfy and NYCE – via either deals with the companies or through published APIs.</p>
      <p>“The formerly isolated subsystems are all now connected to the PSL platform, rather than having their own controls, with no real consistency or interoperability between them,” said Bridgetek. And for additional systems, our “technical team is now looking to engage directly with the system integrator community, in order to develop bespoke arrangements that exactly fit their end customers’ needs”.</p>
      <p>Beyond Panl Smart Living, there is:</p>
      <p>PanL Desk Manager (top photo) for companies that implement ‘hot desking’.</p>
      <p>Panl Room Manager for multiple meeting rooms within a company.</p>
      <p>and a configurable system for hotels with bed-side and door-side touch displays for managing room comfort and door locking amongst other things.</p>
