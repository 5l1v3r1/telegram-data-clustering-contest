      <p>One of the perks of the first credit card from Apple, the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>, is its 3% Daily Cash cash back deal from select retailers. And now one more is included in the (apparently growing) list.</p>
      <p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/nike-is-latest-retailer-to-offer-3-cash-back-to-apple-card-users/"><i>TechCrunch</i></a> has the report on Monday. The publication states that Nike is now one of the retailers supporting 3% Daily Cash with the Apple Card. You’ll still need to use Apple Pay to get the 3% cash back deal, so keep that in mind. But you can make purchases from the Nike Training Club, Nike Running Club, SNKRS, Nike’s official app, Nike.com, and at Nike physical retail stores.</p>
      <p>To be clear, you’ll need to make sure that you use your Apple Card via Apple Pay to get this 3% cash back deal. If you just use the Apple Card, without Apple Pay, you’ll only get 1% Daily Cash.</p>
      <p>Apple says that additional partners will be included over time, but hasn’t tossed out a roadmap or anything just yet. The 3% Daily Cash was only supposed to be for Apple Card/Apple Pay purchases made at Apple stores at the start, but the cash back deal has rapidly expanded <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/08/20/apple-card-launches-united-states/">to include</a> Uber and Uber Eats, <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/09/12/apple-card-walgreens-daily-cash/">Walgreens and Duane Reade pharmacies</a>, and most recently also includes <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/09/19/apple-card-three-percent-back-t-mobile/">purchases made</a> at T-Mobile.</p>
      <p>Any purchase you make with Apple Pay with your Apple Card will continue to get 2% Daily Cash. And purchases made with the Apple Card without Apple Pay get 1% cash back. Daily Cash is unlimited for Apple Card owners, and it’s paid out daily based on purchases made.</p>
