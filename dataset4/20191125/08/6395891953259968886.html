      <p><b>COPENHAGEN, DenmarkÂ (AP)</b> - Sympathy strikes across Finland's transport sector have brought Helsinki to a virtual standstill and prompted flag carrier Finnair to cancel almost 300 flights.</p>
      <p>Buses and ferries in the Finnish capital were also being affected by the strikes, which are aimed at showing support to some 10,000 postal workers.</p>
      <p>Finnair said Monday its flight cancellations will impact at least 20,000 customers and that the strike will affect "several critical services" at Helsinki's airport - a hub for Europe-Asia connections.</p>
      <p>Postal workers have been on a two-week strike over pay. Talks to reach an agreement failed late Sunday.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear how long the strikes would last.</p>
