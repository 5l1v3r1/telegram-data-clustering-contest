      <p>Dennis Quaid isn’t letting criticism dampen his love for his fiancée.</p>
      <p>Back in October, the 65-year-old “Innerspace” actor announced his engagement to 26-year-old Laura Savoie. In a new interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/25/dennis-quaid-i-didnt-go-looking-for-someone-younger-on-his-new-love-and-new-roles">the Guardian</a>, he opens up about their relationship.</p>

      <p>“No, it really doesn’t bother us,” Quaid says of people thinking their 39-year age gap is taboo-breaking. “Everyone comes from the perspective of their own life and so I can’t comment on the way they feel; I can’t even get angry.”</p>
      <p>He adds, “I didn’t go out looking for an age gap or someone really younger than me. I met her at a business event and then the relationship developed. You have no control over who you fall in love with. I don’t fall in love easy. But I can’t let what a few people think control all that. I’ve been married three times and this is the final one, I know it is. I feel like I have a real partner in life.”</p>
      <p>Quaid also takes in stride comparisons to his film “The Parent Trap”, in which his character gets engaged to a 26-year-old.</p>
      <p>“In fact, that very day, we went to the Staglin Family Vineyard, where we filmed ‘The Parent Trap’,” he says of the jokes on Twitter about it. “I hadn’t been there since 1996. So we went and they offered us the opportunity to get married there.”</p>

      <p>Asked if they will take the vineyard up on the offer, Quaid says, “Well, wouldn’t you? For sure!”</p>
      <p>As for when the wedding will take place, the actor teases, “I think you have to get married within a year of asking.”</p>
