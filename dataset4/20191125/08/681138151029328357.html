        <b>An Ipswich primary school which was forced to close on Friday after a sickness bug wiped out staff and pupils has reopened today.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Willows Primary School in Chantry closed on Friday and called in a professional cleaning crew after more than a third contracted the illness.</p>
      <p>A post on the school's website this morning said: "The school will be open this Monday as normal".</p>
      <p>The Downing Close school described the illness as a "severe sickness and diarrhoea bug", which had affected pupils and a number of staff.</p>

      <p>He added he was looking forward to seeing all pupils back this week.</p>
      <p>The school, which is part of the Orwell Multi Academy Trust, has around 358 pupils and a nursery.</p>
