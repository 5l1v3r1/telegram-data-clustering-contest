      <p>RCMP in Spruce Grove Alberta, just outside of Edmonton continue to investigate the murder of a former Kelowna woman.</p>
      <p>Parkland RCMP responded to a call of a woman in distress on a rural road just off Highway 16 in the early morning of November 17th, 2019.</p>
      <p>Police say the woman was deceased when they arrived.  An autopsy determined that 33 year old Saladina Vivacos died as the result of a homicide.</p>
      <p>Friends and family of Vivacos have started a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/yaz8m-our-bright-star?pc=fb_co_campmgmt_w&amp;rcid=r01-157454358838-0ce600e9836a48dd&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=fb_co_campmgmt_w&amp;fbclid=IwAR1S3FckcO_zgQ1ev5m71tPDYJYH0rfnSI6qauOnqA2k1lcr_DP16Q2lNb4">GoFundMe</a> page, "our sister Saladina Vivancos is no longer with us, it feels as if we are living a nightmare that we can’t awaken from."</p>
      <p>The post says, "we are shattered, we are broken, still in disbelief that this could be a reality."</p>
      <p>Funds raised will be used to bring Vivancos home from Alberta to B.C., for the funeral expenses and to help the family with last-minute travel expenses.</p>
