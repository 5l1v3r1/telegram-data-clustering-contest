      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Takeaway">Takeaway</a> delivery group Just Eat advised shareholders not to accept a 710 pence-a-share cash offer from Dutch investment group <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Prosus">Prosus</a>, saying it was inferior to its agreed deal with Takeaway.com to create the largest food delivery player outside <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=China">China</a>.</p>
      <p>“Your Board believes that the Takeaway.com combination provides Just Eat shareholders with greater value creation than the Prosus offer,” it said in a letter to investors on Monday, adding that the Prosus offer also significantly undervalued Just Eat on a standalone basis.</p>
      <p>Takeaway.com said it was “strongly committed” to a deal that would bring together the two most profitable European food delivery websites; Just Eat in Britain and Takeaway.com in the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Netherlands">Netherlands</a>.</p>
      <p>“Our team has a proven ability to win in competitive markets and has defeated numerous competitors in many countries, whether large scale tech giants or well-funded, own-delivery challengers.” Takeaway.com chief executive <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Jitse+Groen">Jitse Groen</a> said.</p>
      <p>“We remain strongly committed to the merger.”</p>
      <p>Internet giant Prosus, which is also based in the Netherlands, gatecrashed Just Eat’s agreed all-share deal with Takeaway last month, with a $6.3 billion cash offer.</p>
      <p>Takeaway’s bid values Just Eat’s shares at about 690 pence each based on Friday’s closing prices. – Reuters</p>
