      <h2>Everyone wants the Great Wolf Sif edition</h2>

      <p>Anecdotally, there was an overwhelming amount of support for <i>Pokemon <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-pokemon-sword-573018.phtml">Sword</a> </i>over <i><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-pokemon-shield-571724.phtml">Shield</a></i> during the new generational reveal, and it seems like the sales data supports that.</p>
      <p>Breaking down <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../pokemon-sword-and-shield-selling-fast-in-japan-further-boosts-switch-hardware-sales-573025.phtml">the Japanese sales numbers</a> even further, Dengeki Online notes that <i>Sword</i> managed to push 499,753 units, towering over <i>Shield</i>'s 347,629 units. Not only did it have the most enticing legendary (basically Great Wolf Sif from <i>Dark Souls</i> over Shield-Face), but Sirfetch'd, which is exclusive to <i>Sword</i>, was one of the most celebrated new creatures.</p>
      <p>Taking a gander at the all-time Switch best-seller list, all <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield </i>need to do collectively to be the most successful <i>Pokemon</i> game on Switch is sell more than 11.28 million copies: enough to dethrone <i>Let's Go Pikachu</i> and <i>Eevee</i>. The pair should also be pushing <i>Link's Awakening</i> and <i>Super Mario Maker 2</i> <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html">out of the top 10 very soon</a>, which sport 3.13 million and 3.93 million copies sold respectively.</p>
      <p><i>Pokemon</i>, like <i>Call of Duty</i>, continues to defy sales expectations while getting plenty of complacency complaints.</p>
