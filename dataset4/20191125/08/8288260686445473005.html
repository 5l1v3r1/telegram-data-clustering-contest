      <h2>Latest Aston Villa news includes manager confident he can keep AVFC midfielder beyond January transfer window</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:46:05+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:46</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa midfielder Jake Doyle-Hayes is expected to see out his loan spell at Cheltenham Town.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old joined the League Two side on a season-long switch in the summer after spending the second half of the last campaign at Cambridge United.</p>
      <p>He has established himself as one of the first names on the Robins’ team-sheet having impressed in their push for promotion.</p>
      <p>Doyle-Hayes has already racked up 18 appearances this term, the most recent of which came in Cheltenham’s 1-1 draw with Colchester United on Saturday as he delivered another solid showing.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> have an option to recall the Republic of Ireland youth international when the transfer window re-opens in January but manager Michael Duff is confident his side will be able to keep him until the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Discussing his trio of young loanees which also includes Hull City pair Jacob Greaves and Max Sheaf, Duff told <a href="https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-midfielder-hull-city-3573138">GloucestershireLive:</a> "I'd like to think we can keep them because they are here to develop and they are getting minutes so I'd like to think they'd be definites."</p>
      <p>Doyle-Hayes made his senior debut for Villa in a League Cup clash against Wigan in August 2017 and signed a three-year contract a month later.</p>
      <p>Cheltenham reporter Jon Palmer told <i><b>BirminghamLive</b> </i><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-jake-doyle-hayes-16967168">recently:</a> “Cheltenham have had a host of youngsters from Premier League and Championship clubs on loan in recent years and some have not looked ready for senior football, but Doyle-Hayes certainly does look fully equipped to thrive in League Two.</p>
      <p>“They brought in Easah Suliman from Villa in 2016 and you could tell he was going to be a useful player, but the move was possibly a little early for him at that stage.</p>
      <p>“In contrast, Doyle-Hayes looks absolutely comfortable already and based on what he's done in the opening weeks of the season, I would certainly expect to see him go on to shine higher up the footballing ladder in the near future.”</p>
