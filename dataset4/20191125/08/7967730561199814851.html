      <h1>Hogan returns to training a day after car crash</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:55:34+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:55</time> by <a rel="author">Sam McClure</a></address>
      <p>Injury-riddled Fremantle star Jesse Hogan has returned to training despite being involved in a car accident only 24 hours earlier.</p>
      <p>Hogan's car finished on its side after he clipped a parked car late on Sunday morning outside a teammate's house, according to the club.</p>
      <p>The former Demon managed to climb out of his sedan before an ambulance and two fire trucks arrived at the scene in the suburb of Bicton.</p>

      <p>Firefighters from the station in Fremantle attended the scene but weren't required for further action.</p>
      <p>Hogan joined in with his teammates at training at the club's base of Cockburn on Monday, alongside new recruit and former Magpie James Aish.</p>
      <p>When contacted by <i>The Age</i>, Fremantle stated there was no police involvement in the incident.</p>
      <p>The club said a member of the public called for an ambulance.</p>
      <p>Hogan was transported by ambulance to Fiona Stanley Hospital in Murdoch, where he was met by a club doctor.</p>
      <p>He was released a short time later and despite original plans to skip the team's next training session, he presented on Monday and trained with the group.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old endured a difficult start to his Fremantle career, managing just 12 games.</p>

      <p>His season ended in round 14 when he re-injured his foot against the Demons in round 14. He went under the knife, where surgeons inserted screws into his troublesome navicular bone. Hogan has played 83 games in total, booting 165 goals.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, four-time premiership Hawk Grant Birchall believes he can still play senior football having officially started training with the Brisbane Lions.</p>
      <p>Birchall has played only eight matches in the past three years largely because of knee and calf problems, his final game for the Hawks curtailed by a hamstring strain against North Melbourne in round 21.</p>

      <p>A veteran of 248 matches, he was restricted to jogging laps at Brisbane’s Yeronga training facility on Monday.</p>
      <p>"It’s been a pretty tough few years with my body, so I thought a fresh start up here would do me the world of good," Birchall said.</p>
      <p>"I’m sure the body will appreciate the warmer weather. I feel as though I can still play at the level. I think I proved that with the couple of games I played last year. I just need to get the work in and have full faith in the guys here."</p>
      <p>He has reunited with coach Chris Fagan, the former Hawks football department boss, and Luke Hodge, his former Hawks captain, who is now a part-time mentoring coach with the Lions.</p>
      <p>"Hodgey told me a few things and both him and Fages filled me in on what’s going on and I’m more than happy to join and get started," Birchall said.</p>
