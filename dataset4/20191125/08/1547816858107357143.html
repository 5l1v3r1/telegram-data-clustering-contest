      <p>We're back with another episode of Fashion Vashion And All That. Our guest this time was Athiya Shetty. The actress had a lot of interesting dope to share on her style files. </p>
      <p>We started the conversation by asking how has she dealt with the pressures in Bollywood. The actress, dressed in a blush pink pantsuit said she has become calmer with time. Athiya also spoke about her father, Suniel Shetty's quirky dressing sense and how she has borrowed all his gold chains. Watch the video below:</p>
