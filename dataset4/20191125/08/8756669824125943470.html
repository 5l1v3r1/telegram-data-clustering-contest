      <h1>Mercedes-Benz's V12 to live on after all (but not in Maybach GLS) – report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:02:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.carmag.co.za/author/ryanbubear/" target="_blank">Ryan Bubear</a></address>
      <p>Thought Mercedes-Benz’s V12 engine was dead in the water? Well, think again, according to new reported comments from the head of Daimler...</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://gtspirit.com/2019/11/22/exclusive-v12-will-return-next-generation-mercedes-benz-s-class-2021/"><i>GTspirit</i></a>, Daimler CEO Ola Källenius reportedly confirmed the V12 would live on in the next-generation S-Class, despite the <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/farewell-v12-mercedes-amg-s65-final-edition-unveiled/">Mercedes-AMG S65 Final Edition</a> model seemingly signalling the end of the line for the twin-turbo 6,0-litre unit (and all <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/industry-news/farewell-v12-mercedes-amg-s65-variants-no-longer-offered-in-sa/">S65 variants</a> recently being pulled from the local range).</p>
      <p>Set to hit the market in 2021, Källenius reportedly suggested the flagship versions of the next-gen S-Class would again boast V12 power, with the publication speculating the firm would reengineer the current engine to meet Europe's ever-tightening emissions regulations.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, though, Källenius ruled out twelve-cylinder power for the recently revealed <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/new-models/new-mercedes-maybach-gls-unveiled-as-ultimate-luxury-flagship-suv/">Mercedes-Maybach GLS</a>, saying “we have no plans for a Maybach GLS V12”. He did, however, confirm there would be a six-cylinder version “in due time”.</p>
      <p>The Maybach-badged version of Stuttgart’s range-topping SUV is offered in GLS600 guise, with power coming from a 410 kW twin-turbo 4,0-litre V8 rather than a V12.</p>
