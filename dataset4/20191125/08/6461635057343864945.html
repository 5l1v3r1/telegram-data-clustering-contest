      <h3>Barcelona full-back Nelson Semedo is being tracked down by Inter Milan.</h3>
      <p>As per <a href="https://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/transfer-news/1199387/reports-inter-milan-barcelona-out-of-favour-messi-valverde-nelson-semedo/amp/"><b>Fox Sports</b></a>, Inter Milan are interested in Barcelona’s Nelson Semedo but are yet to make an official approach for the Portuguese defender.</p>
      <p>It is to be noted that Semedo isn’t exactly a huge part of Valverde’s plans and it’s no surprise that Barcelona are willing to strike a deal with Inter Milan involving him. It is believed that both the clubs are eager to do business with each other but are keen to decide the players involved before anything takes place.</p>
      <p>Barcelona do want to sell Ivan Rakitic and it’s no secret now. They are however, looking for Lautaro Martinez but apparently Antonio Conte is not fond of Ivan and Martinez is off the market for them. The possibility of Aturo Vidal was also ruled out as the Inter CEO is concerned about his off-field profile but are willing to go for Semedo who has made 16 appearances for the La Liga champions this season.</p>
      <p>Barca are also keeping an eye on Joshua Kimmich and are preparing to land him next summer. If they do manage to capture the German, he will be replacing Nelson Semedo. Hence the Blaugranes need to make sure that they have the services of the Portuguese defender at least till the next summer.</p>
      <p>Valverde needs to be absolutely sure about his plans and the players that he wants in it. As far as the current situation is concerned, Kimmich is a better fit at the Camp Nou than Semedo is and the Catalan giants should be mindful of that. Only time will tell how far this rumor will travel.</p>
