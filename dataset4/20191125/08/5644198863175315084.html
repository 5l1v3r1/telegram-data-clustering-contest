      <p>Joe Denly and Ben Stokes were digging in to try and save England from defeat as they took their side to 98-4 at lunch on the fifth day of the first test against New Zealand at Bay Oval on Monday.</p>
      <p>WELLINGTON: New Zealand wrapped up an impressive innings and 65-run victory over England shortly after tea on the fifth day of the first test at Bay Oval on Monday with Neil Wagner running through the lower order.</p>
      <p>Wagner took three wickets in 17 balls for just one run as England collapsed from 132-5 to 138-8 before tea, then broke a 59-run ninth-wicket partnership between Jofra Archer and Sam Curran after they had threatened to thwart the hosts.</p>

      <p>England had resumed on Monday on 55-3 and needing to bat the entire final day to stop New Zealand from taking a 1-0 lead into the second match of the two-test series that starts on Friday in Hamilton.</p>
