        <b>Several Premier League managers are under increasing pressure after the weekend, but who will be the first to be shown the exit door?</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Unai Emery</h3>
      <p>Arsenal needed an injury time equaliser to rescue a 2-2 draw at home to Southampton.</p>
      <p>The Saints haven't won a league game since mid-September and must be wondering how they didn't leave the Emirates with all three points.</p>
      <p>The Arsenal players were booed off after the sixth game in a row without a win. Unai Emery's side are eight points off the Champions League places but the way things are going, that gap looks like it will only get bigger.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are on their worst run of form for over 20 years, and Emery appears to have lost the support of the fans.</p>
      <p>Arsenal face Eintracht Frankfurt, Norwich, Brighton, West Ham and Standard Liege in the coming weeks. All those games would not be considered to be the toughest fixtures, but at the moment it is a struggle for Emery and co.</p>
      <p>Former Arsenal midfielder Mikel Arteta is one of the names being linked to the job.</p>
      <h3>Marco Silva</h3>
      <p>The Everton manager is the favourite to be the next Premier League manager to get sacked.</p>
      <p>The Toffees lost 2-0 at home to Norwich over the weekend, leaving them just four points above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>Everton were in good form towards the end of last season and the hope at Goodison Park was that the club would push on.</p>
      <p>However, it has been a struggle for Silva and it seems it is now a case of when and not if he gets the sack.</p>
      <p>Everton lost to a Norwich team that had not won an away game all season and had only scored one goal on the road, which incidentally came on the opening weekend against Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Their next five games are against Leicester, Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United and Leicester (in the League Cup).</p>
      <p>Former Toffees boss David Moyes could be on his way back to the club but former midfielder Arteta is also a name being mentioned.</p>
      <h3>Manuel Pellegrini</h3>
      <p>West Ham beat Manchester United in September to move up to fifth in the league but since then the Hammers are without a win in seven top-flight games.</p>
      <p>West Ham lost 3-2 at home to Tottenham and in truth that scoreline flattered the home side.</p>
      <p>The poor run of form also coincides with an injury to goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. His replacement Roberto Jimenez is making a name for himself, but for all the wrong reasons.</p>
      <p>Roberto's poor form could well end up costing Pellegrini his job, and former Republic of Ireland international Chris Hughton is one of the managers being tipped to replace the Chilean.</p>
      <h3>Other managers under pressure</h3>
      <p>Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores could find himself under increasing pressure in the coming weeks even though he's not back at the club long.</p>
      <p>Southampton's Ralph Hasenhuttl would be feeling a lot better if his side had beaten Arsenal.</p>
      <p>With every game Manchester United do not win, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can expect questions about being the right man for the job as long as Mauricio Pochettino is available.</p>
