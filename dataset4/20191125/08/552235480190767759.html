      <h2>Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he is committed to improving the experience of victims in the system.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:47:09+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:47</time> by <a rel="author">Conor Riordan</a></address>
      <p>Criminals across Scotland will be required to contribute to the cost of supporting victims.</p>
      <p>A new financial penalty will be imposed on all offenders who are sentenced to pay a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/thousands-rape-victims-left-without-20952384">court</a> fine, with the money going to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/thousands-rape-victims-left-without-20952384">Victim Surcharge Fund</a> .</p>
      <p>The charge applies to crimes committed from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/thousands-rape-victims-left-without-20952384">Monday</a> , and payments from the fund will begin being made in six to 12 months' time.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/thousands-rape-victims-left-without-20952384">Justice Secretary</a> Humza Yousaf said: "Experiencing crime can be an isolating and frightening experience and we are committed to improving the experiences of victims in our justice system.</p>
      <p>"It's only right that criminals should pay towards helping victims to recover and move on with their lives.</p>
      <p>"The money raised through the surcharge will pay for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/thousands-rape-victims-left-without-20952384">practical support</a> that will make a real difference to victims and their families.</p>
      <p>"While Scotland's long-term fall in crime means fewer people fall prey to criminals, we are continuing to invest £18 million annually to improve support, advice and information for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/thousands-rape-victims-left-without-20952384">victims</a> .</p>
      <p>"This new fund will be a valuable addition to support available.</p>
      <p>"Over the coming year, we will also be carrying out further work to better <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/thousands-rape-victims-left-without-20952384">understand</a> where the gaps are in how Scotland supports victims and witnesses."</p>
