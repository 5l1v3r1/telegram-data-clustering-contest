      <h1>Darrell Clarke: More change was needed for Walsall</h1>
      <h2>Walsall boss Darrell Clarke admits he wished he made more changes to his side for the clash with Stevenage after their mid-week win over Darlington.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:27:14+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/liam-keen/" target="_blank">Liam Keen</a></address>
      <p>After the 1-0 FA Cup replay win over the North East side on Wednesday, Clarke made three changes to that side for the League Two 0-0 draw with Stevenage on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Dan Scarr, Alfie Bates and Shay Facey all returned to the side, replacing Mat Sadler, Cameron Norman and Gary Liddle.</p>
      <p>And after claiming the share of the points was a fair result, Clarke said he should have made more changes to freshen up his side.</p>
      <p>"I thought we were miles off in the wide areas in the first half," he said.</p>
      <p>"We were very ineffective in our shape, they put three high up the pitch and we didn't release our full-backs enough.</p>
      <p>"That was disappointing but it sometimes can happen.</p>
      <p>"I probably wish I made a few more changes to be honest but I thought I'd go with a bit of momentum and not make too many changes.</p>
      <p>"You're forever learning as a manager.</p>
      <p>"I see games and I always go with my gut instinct of what I think needs to change.</p>
      <p>"I have no problem changing things if I don't think things are working or one or two lads are not having a good game.</p>
      <p>"The lads know how I work, they're getting used to the way I work.</p>
      <p>"That's the way they've got to work, they have to get used to that.</p>
      <p>"And they are to be fair to them.</p>
      <p>"There's no scapegoats here, we just get on with our work.</p>
      <p>"You have to be brave as a manager to change it if things aren't working well."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the clean sheet was the Saddlers' tenth in all competitions this season and Clarke praised his squad for their work, but said more was still needed.</p>
      <p>“If we assess where we are after the games we’ve played, 10 clean sheets is testament to the hard working nature of the group," he added.</p>
      <p>“But we have to be better at times with the tempo of our play and our passing. </p>
      <p>“I said to the lads that I feel like I’m coaching them every minute.</p>
      <p>“You have to do that sometimes with a developing group but I thought one or two players were way off the game. </p>
      <p>“That can happen as well so we’ll pick them up and try and take the positives out the week.</p>
      <p>“And build towards a couple of cup games coming up."</p>
