      <p>A drunk son rang <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">police</a> and threatened to "smash and burn" his parents' home just so he could be arrested.</p>
      <p>Thomas Cavanagh was sat in a pub four miles away from his mum and dad's address, where he also lives, when he made the threats during numerous calls to the emergency services, a court heard.</p>
      <p>An officer was sent to locate the 25-year-old, who was at the Village Inn, in Longframlington, but his behaviour didn't stop there.</p>
      <p>South East Northumberland Magistrates' Court was told that Cavanagh continued to shout "You better lock me up or I will go round and f*****g destroy the place" and "I'll smash the place up".</p>
      <p>His wish was finally granted and Cavanagh was arrested for making threats to damage property.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/courts">court</a> heard that, while in a cell, Cavanagh, of Main Street, Felton, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland">Northumberland</a>, then destroyed a mattress to the value of £150.</p>
      <p>He appeared in the dock last Thursday, where he pleaded guilty to one count of making threats to damage property and one of criminal damage.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor, James Long, said Cavanagh made the first call on the evening of September 19 this year.</p>
      <p>"The defendant said he intended to attend his parents' address and smash the house up and burn their two cars," Mr Long added.</p>
      <p>"A police officer is on his way to Longframlington when he gets a message from the control room to say the defendant has been in touch again making the same threats.</p>
      <p>"There's then yet another call where the defendant says 'You better get a move on as I have a weapon on me'. He threatens to smash and burn the place."</p>
      <p>The court heard that no weapon was ever discovered on Cavanagh when he was eventually arrested outside the pub.</p>
      <p>Kyle Patterson, defending, said Cavanagh's parents were oblivious to the threats and that he only made them to the police.</p>
      <p>The solicitor added: "He's had too much to drink and there's been an argument and he's cross, so he decides to ring the police.</p>
      <p>"His intention is to say silly things and get arrested. It was never his intention to carry out the threats."</p>
      <p>Magistrates ordered Cavanagh, who has no past convictions, to pay £150 compensation and gave him a six-month conditional discharge.</p>
