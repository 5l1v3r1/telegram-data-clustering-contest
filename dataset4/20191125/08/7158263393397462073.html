      <p>Congrats, you’ve got a beautiful bundle of joy inside you! But it’s not an easy feat navigating the endless options of <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/fashion/g29834840/pregnancy-outfits-cute-maternity-fashion/">maternity outfits</a> and figuring out what will fit. Yes, there are comfy <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/fashion/a29776620/best-maternity-leggings/">maternity leggings</a>, but you might not want to wear them your entire pregnancy. With your growing bump, you want clothes you can wear to work or go out in that still reflect your personal style, but finding the right maternity clothes can seem like a daunting task. Trust me, I've been there!</p>
      <p>Personally, buying items I could wear after pregnancy was a top priority because I'd get the most wear out of my purchases. And even "non-maternity" options can accommodate a bump if it has enough stretch or has a roomy silhouette—ordering a couple sizes up can work, too! Here, we've rounded up 28 cute maternity (and non-maternity) brands and stores to shop from that'll make you the most stylish mama-to-be.</p>
