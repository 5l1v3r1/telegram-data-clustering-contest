      <p>Good evening ladies, gents and non-binary friends. It’s time for another episode of <i>15 Minutes</i>, the Facebook Watch series in which we travel around Oz each week reliving the most iconic viral moments in history, and those responsible for them. This week, comedian and co-host <b>Nina Oyama</b> sits down with with <b>Mia Agraviador</b>, AKA the ‘porque no los dos’ girl from that iconic Old El Paso ad from ’07, to talk about all things fame, virality and, well, <i>tacos</i>.</p>
      <p>Need a cute lil’ refresher on one of the most groundbreaking moments in Oz meme history? Check out the ad below.</p>

      <p>Now 19, Mia has had time to reflect on the commercial’s success, some 13 years on from its initial release. The Sydney-sider and talented artist admits that, as a young’n, she initially found her newfound fame overwhelming. “I remember being a little shy at the time. I actually didn’t like the attention.”</p>
      <p>She used art as a means to cope. “I wasn’t okay with being in the limelight,” she reminisces, “so just drawing and creating little fantasy stories in my little world would help me with that, I think.”</p>

      <p>Although viral images can often lead to notoriety, Mia’s father admits that the internet has had an overwhelmingly positive relationship with the meme of bébé Mia. “I would often look in on it just to see how people were reacting, just to make sure no one was trolling or bullying, but it turns out that it’s pretty much universally loved.”</p>
      <p>He continues: “She’s the ultimate diplomat, literally solving world problems.” Legend.</p>
      <p>Now, I hate to break it to you, but even the world’s most diplomatic human has her preference: “I a<i>lways</i> take hard [tacos]. Yes, I’m sorry… I don’t have both… I have hard.” Controversial to some, but I completely agree with Mia – hard shell all day, every day.</p>
      <p>Check out the full chat between Nina and Mia below.</p>
