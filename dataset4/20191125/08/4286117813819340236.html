      <p>Bengal BJP vice president and party's candidate for the Karimpur assembly by-poll Jay Prakash Majumdar was on Monday thrashed, kicked and thrown into a ditch allegedly by a group of Trinamool Congress activists during the polling.</p>
      <p>In a video shared by news agency ANI, Trinamool Congress activists can be seen dragging Jay Prakash Majumdar and then kicking him off the road after he came out of his car.</p>
      <p>The incident took place on Monday when voting for the Karimpur assembly by-election was on and Jay Prakash Majumdar was trying to enter a polling booth.</p>

      <p>Jay Prakash Majumdar said, I was beaten and kicked and slogans were being shouted against me. Even the local police did not take any action."</p>
      <p>"When I reached Booth no. 49 in the morning and dropped two of my agents, within few minutes they were abducted by some TMC workers. Ramnagar village is on the side and TMC goon Raju Mallick started threatening villagers. We have informed the police to arrest Raju Mallick immediately and also the Election Commission about the incident," he said.</p>
      <p>Majumdar further added, "We have requested the police to look for our missing agents. Our sources tell us the two agents have been detained at the residence of the TMC leader. Their cell phones are unreachable and we are very worried."</p>
      <p>A local Trinamool Congress supporter, Manisuraman Mondal said, BJP has no place here in Karimpur. After the election gets over, BJP will not have any place. People are not voting BJP and people have turned their back on BJP. Voting is going on peacefully but Jay Prakash Majumdar was trying to break the harmony. We will not let that happen.</p>
      <p>Denying the allegations as "baseless", the Nadia district unit of Trinamool Congress said, locals had attacked the BJP leader as they were angry with him for "vitiating" the atmosphere in the area.</p>
      <p>The Election Commission has sought reports about the incident.</p>
      <p>Besides Karimpur, by-polls are underway in Kharagpur Sadar and Kaliaganj Assembly seats.</p>
      <p>While Kharagpur Sadar and Karimpur seats were held by the TMC, Kaliaganj was represented in the Assembly by the Congress.</p>
      <p>In Karimpur, vacated by MLA Mahua Moitra after emerging victorious from Krishnnanagar Lok Sabha seat, CPI(M)-Congress candidate Gholam Rabbi is contesting against Majumdar and TMC's Bimalendu Singha Roy.</p>
      <p>The Kharagpur Sadar seat fell vacant as the sitting TMC MLA contested and won Lok Sabha seat.</p>
      <p>By-polls were necessitated in Kaliaganj following the death of Congress MLA Parmathanath Roy.</p>
      <p>About 30.17 per cent of over seven lakh electorate exercised their franchise in the by-polls to the three Assembly seats till 11 am.</p>
