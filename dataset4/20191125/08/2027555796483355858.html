      <h1>Uruguay presidential vote: Conservative Oppn runs ahead</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:35:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/reuters" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Uruguay's conservative opposition held a slim lead on Sunday in a run-off presidential election between the liberal ruling party and a resurgent opposition that had been the pre-vote favourite to clinch victory.</p>
      <p>With around 97.5% of polling booths counted, Luis Lacalle Pou's center-right National Party had 48.81% ahead of Daniel Martinez's ruling Broad Front party with 47.41%, data from the official electoral court showed.</p>
      <p>The slimmer-than-expected gap meant an official result could be delayed until early next week. Pre-election polls had made Lacalle Pou, whose father is a former president, favorite to topple the long-standing coalition that has led farm-driven Uruguay through a period of stability and growth.</p>
      <p>Some 2.7 million Uruguayan voters were eligible to choose, with a widespread expectation that the South American nation was set for a shift back towards the right after around 15 years of liberal rule.</p>
      <p>As pre-election campaigns closed last week Lacalle Pou, a 46-year-old, had struck a confident tone, saying Uruguay was demanding change. Pre-election polls show him beating Martinez by a margin of 6-8 points.</p>
      <p>"It's the people...saying 'I want to shake up the government's drowsiness and change it,'" said Lacalle Pou, who became the front-runner after striking deals with a string of allies following an October first round.</p>
      <p>Martinez, a 62-year-old former Montevideo mayor, has said the five-party coalition against him is simply an attempt to dislodge the liberal government.</p>
      <p>He has also warned about "fundamentalist" policies taking Uruguay sharply to the right, "ending up like in Argentina or Brazil."</p>
      <p>Uruguay's current President Tabare Vazquez has been in power since 2015, but has recently had to grapple with a sluggish economy weighed down by the effects of drought and flooding on the crucial farm sector.</p>
      <p>Amid wider regional unrest in Bolivia and Chile, Uruguay remains stable, but a slowing economy saw growth of just 0.1% in the second quarter of the year.</p>
      <p>Unemployment has also edged up to 9.2% versus a year earlier, while inflation this year so far has been 8.36%.</p>
