      <p>French luxury giant LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton has said it has reached a deal to buy US-based jewellery outfit Tiffany &amp; Co for 16.2 billion US dollars (£12.58 billion).</p>
      <p>LVMH said in a statement that the deal values the 180-year old Tiffany and its 300 boutiques worldwide at 135 dollars a share.</p>
      <p>The agreed deal is higher than the 14.5 billion dollars cash offer LVMH made last month.</p>
      <p>The conglomerate said both companies’ boards approved the deal and hope to finalise the takeover in 2020 subject to the approval of regulators and Tiffany shareholders.</p>
      <p>LVMH says the deal will strengthen its position in high-end jewellery and in the US market.</p>

      <p>LVMH already owns 75 brands including Christian Dior, Fendi, and Givenchy as well as watchmaker Tag Heuer.</p>
      <p>The purchase would also give LVMH a much broader foothold in the United States and broaden its offerings in jewellery.</p>
      <p>Tiffany says the deal will ensure the company’s long-term sustainability.</p>
      <p>Tiffany, which is trying to transform its brand to appeal to younger shoppers, could use a company with deep pockets to help expand its business.</p>
      <p>The offer comes as luxury goods companies have been wrestling with changing habits of shoppers who are increasingly buying online.</p>
      <p>They are also purchasing second-hand luxury items from places like The RealReal.com.</p>
      <p>In addition, luxury companies are facing fears of an economic slowdown in China, a key area of business, while they are already dealing with a slowdown in international tourism in the US.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, it launched a men’s jewellery collection, and it is increasing its marketing to a more diverse customer base like same-sex couples.</p>
      <p>It has also been renovating its flagship store in Manhattan.</p>
      <p>Still, Tiffany’s US sales have been stagnating as China’s slowing economy has weighed on spending by Chinese tourists, who make up a substantial portion of luxury spending.</p>
      <p>The strong dollar has also made Tiffany products more expensive for consumers outside the US.</p>
