      <h1>Huawei teams with Devialet on a $300 smart speaker for China</h1>
      <h2>The Sound X will have a 60 watt double woofer and 360-degree surround sound.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:24:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.facebook.com/steven.dent.18" target="_blank">Steve Dent</a></address>
      <p>Huawei has <a href="https://chinese.engadget.com/2019/11/25/sound-x-devialet-speaker/">unveiled</a> the Sound X, a smart speaker it build in conjunction with bespoke French HiFi company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/09/devialet-phantom-reactor-speaker/">Devialet</a>. On top of the premium look, it packs a 60 watt double subwoofer and 360-degree sound, along with Devialet's speaker active matching (SAM) that eliminates distortion and push-push woofer vibration-cancelling tech.</p>
      <p>It's also got one-touch control, Huawei's HiLink smart home control, Huawei's "Xiaoyi" voice assistant and support for Huawei music. The speaker was unveiled at the same time as Huawei's iPad Pro-like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/25/huawei-matebook-pro-small-bezels/">MatePad Pro</a> tablet. Huawei already has a couple of smart speakers, including one that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/26/huawei-smart-speaker-homepod-clone/">strongly resembles</a> (wait for it) Apple's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/26/huawei-smart-speaker-homepod-clone/">HomePod</a>.</p>
      <p>Devialet said the Sound X represents its "first partnership in Asia," and noted that China is its "second-largest region worldwide in terms of sales." The company has done a number of alliances elsewhere, however, including a surround sound <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/07/27/sky-soundbox-tv-speaker-devialet/">TV speaker</a> for Sky, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/07/altice-amplify-smart-speaker/">Altice Amplify</a> smart speaker from Altice USA, Renault's crazy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/13/renault-symbioz-concept-ev-vr-impressions/">Symbioz</a> self-driving car and an unusual <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/02/23/freebox-delta-set-top-box-devialet-speakers-impressions/">set-top box</a> with internet provider Free in France.</p>
      <p>Huawei's Sound X will only be sold in China, but it's now on pre-order for a relatively low sum -- at least, considering the Devialet angle -- of 1,999 yuan (around $285). It doesn't appear that the product will be coming to any western markets, however.</p>
