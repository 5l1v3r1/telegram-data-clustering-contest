      <p>The police have arrested fishing raft supervisor Kyaw Aung and a male broker involved in the case against the trafficked Dagon University student, and the remaining five of the seven persons facing legal action are being hunted, a senior officer from Myanmar Police Force.   </p>
      <p>"As soon as the case emerged, we went to the trafficked student for questioning. After receiving information, we contacted an anti-human trafficking squad in Pyapon. On the second day, we opened a case at Kyauktada and Dala police stations. Then, we arrested the fishing raft supervisor and a human trafficker. We are pursuing the remaining traffickers," said Police Major Khin Maung Kywe of Anti-Human Trafficking Squad. </p>
      <p>Kyauktada Township Police Station opened a case against seven persons involved in the trafficking case on November 21. </p>
      <p>"We have opened the case against seven persons. The brokers are here (in Yangon) and from the other side (in Pyapon). We have arrested the fishing raft supervisor and a broker who sent the student to Pyapon," said Police Major Khin Maung Kywe. </p>
      <p>The human traffickers sold Myo Thura Tun, a final year student from Dagon University majoring in history to fish wholesalers in Pyapon Township, Ayeyawady Region, for K700,000.</p>
      <p>The student was sold into working forcefully at a fish farm when he came to Yangon to do a job as asked by his parents on October 2.</p>
      <p>The human traffickers sold him to fish wholesale shops in Pyapon for K700,000. After about 45 days, he was released as his parents paid the money back. He was injured as he was tortured by a supervisor of the fishing raft.  </p>
