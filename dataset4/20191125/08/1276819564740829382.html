      <h1>Polar bear photos 'testify to the beauty of this fragile world'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:28:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:28</time> by <a rel="author">Mary Jo DiLonardo</a></address>
      <p>Nature and wildlife photographer <a href="https://michelrawicki.com/">Michel Rawicki</a> grew up in Paris, but he has always been attracted to icy landscapes.</p>
      <p>He tells MNN that the "call of the cold" appeared when he was 10 years old. He was in the Valley of Chamonix where he discovered the ice cave in the <a href="https://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/eco-tourism/photos/10-views-will-test-your-fear-heights/step-void-france">Aiguille du Midi</a> mountain.</p>
      <p>"I took the ice in my arms ... and started photographing with my Kodak Starflash Brownie," he tells MNN in an email.</p>
      <p>Enthralled by people, animals and icy panoramas, Rawicki said from early childhood he really wanted to photograph polar bears â€” known by the Inuit indigenous people as "nanuk."</p>
      <p>"The encounter with Nanuk has always been in my dreams since I am a kid," Rawicki writes. "In 1992, I had the same chance to discover Greenland and walk on the ice cap; it was also the year when I first meet and photographed Nanuk."</p>

      <p>After several decades photographing his favorite subjects, Rawicki shares his images in "<a href="https://www.accartbooks.com/us/store/pv/9781788840422/polar-bears/michel-rawicki/">Polar Bears: A Life Under Threat</a>," published by ACC Art Books. The beautifully illustrated book contains gorgeous photos of bears playing, lolling, hunting and walking on the ice.</p>
      <p>Rawicki says on land, he is only about 100 meters (110 yards) away from the bears. When photographing them by sea, he's often even closer.</p>
      <p>Rawicki shot the photos throughout Alaska, Canada, Norway, Greenland and the Arctic Ocean.</p>

      <p>After decades of shooting in the cold, he typically is prepared and knows what to expect.</p>
      <p>"By chance I am not chilly, except when the temperature reaches minus 40/50 C (minus 40/minus 58 F)," Rawicki says.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes it is difficult to shoot with polar gloves, that is why I had a serious frostbite and [managed] to lose a finger some years ago in Canada by an amazing 'Northern light night.' Also in 2012, I fell down in the water as I was walking on the ice approaching a baby seal off the Canadian coast north of the Saint Laurent River. I then unfortunately learned to 'swim as a seal.'

      <p>Because he has been shooting in the Arctic for so long, Rawicki has observed first-hand how polar ice has changed over the years.</p>
      <p>"According to scientists, the Arctic sea ice has lost nearly 30% since the 1990s," he says. "Between 1995 and 2006, I saw the pack ice recede north by several hundred kilometers."</p>

      <p>Rawicki says he hopes to create images of special, gentle moments.</p>
      <p>"It's having the privilege to capture and share private moments of great emotion because everything not shared or given is lost," he says.</p>

      <p>Rawicki explains what he feels is his job as a photographer.</p>
      <p>"To be aware of the changes taking place and to testify to the beauty of this fragile world."</p>
