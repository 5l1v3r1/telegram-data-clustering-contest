      <h1>Tales of the Anglo-Saxon crypt, and why Frank Skinner was one of first to see inside</h1>
      <h2>St Aidan's Church houses 110 Anglo-Saxon remains found near Bamburgh Castle, which the public can now see thanks to lottery-funded project</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:00:26+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tony Henderson</a></address>
      <p>A funny thing happened to history specialist Jessica Turner as she helped prepare an Anglo-Saxon burial chamber for its public opening.</p>
      <p>The 12th-century crypt of St Aidan’s Church in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/bamburgh">Bamburgh</a> , <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland">Northumberland</a> , is now home to the bones of 110 individuals from the 7th and 8th centuries, whose graves were uncovered by archaeologists in sand dunes near Bamburgh Castle.</p>
      <p>The crypt has now opened to the public as part of the Accessing Aidan/Bamburgh Bones project, which has set out to tell the story of the village that was once the capital of the Kingdom of Northumbria, and of the 110 individuals who would have been linked to the royal court around 1,400 years ago.</p>

      <p>Lighting and access work has taken place at the crypt, with visitors viewing a film from a balcony to learn about the long history of Bamburgh and the Bowl Hole dunes cemetery, where the burials were located.</p>
      <p>But as preparations for last week’s public opening gathered pace, and project officer Jessica was stood outside the church waiting for a delivery, comedians Frank Skinner and Pierre Novellie turned up.</p>
      <p>Both are Anglo-Saxon enthusiasts and while passing through the area on their current Showbiz UK tour, they took the opportunity to call in at the church.</p>
      <p>Jessica gave them a preview tour of the crypt, with a view of the ossuary, where the Anglo-Saxon bones have been laid to rest.</p>
      <p>“It was a fortuitous meeting and they were both delighted to see the crypt,” said Jessica.</p>
      <p>Before the public opening, the crypt was blessed by the Bishop of Newcastle, the Right Rev Christine Hardman.</p>

      <p>The project also includes a digital ossuary which can be accessed free online at <a href="http://www.bamburghbones.org/">www.bamburghbones.org</a> , where visitors can also find out more about the Bamburgh Bones project and visiting St Aidan’s Church and crypt.</p>
      <p>The vicar of St Aidan’s, the Rev Louise Taylor-Kenyon, said: “The crypt is an extraordinary, amazing space which has been hidden and has now been opened up for everybody to have access. This is one of the few churches in Britain which is named after a saint we know lived and died in this space, and where there have been centuries of continuous worship since his time in the 7th century.</p>
      <p>“In this space are now the remains of 110 people who lived and worked at Bamburgh at the same time as St Aidan.”</p>
      <p>The Bowl Hole excavations, by the Bamburgh Research Project and Durham University, ran from 1998 to 2007.</p>
      <p>It is believed that the high-status cemetery, thought to contain upwards of 1,000 graves, was the burial place of those associated with the royal court of Northumbria, which ruled from Bamburgh.</p>
      <p>The Bamburgh Bones project is a collaboration between the Northumberland Coast AONB Partnership, St Aidan’s Parochial Church Council, Durham University, Newcastle Diocese and Bamburgh Heritage, backed by a £355,600 grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund.</p>

      <p>Scientific research on the bones was carried out at Durham university, which showed that Bamburgh was a cosmopolitan hub drawing people from across Europe to live and work – including St Aidan, who travelled from Iona to establish Christianity in the area and founded a place of worship in 635AD on the site of the present church that bears his name.</p>
      <p>Isotope analysis has revealed that less than 10% of the 110 skeletons came from the immediate Bamburgh area, with most originating in the wider British Isles, particularly Western Scotland, and as far away as Scandinavia and the Mediterranean.</p>
      <p>It is proof, says Ms Taylor-Kenyon, people have always travelled, and that even in the 7th century “the idea of country boundaries was fragile. It is a reminder this nation’s history has continually been one of people visiting, settling, intermingling, and creating relationships and a more diverse society as a consequence”.</p>

      <p>The research has also revealed details of individuals, including a man aged between 17-20 who died after a sword blow cut through his left side from his collarbone to his knee, and a nine-year-old whose teeth reveal they were possibly born as far away as North Africa.</p>
      <p>The skeletons which were excavated, then analysed and researched over a 20-year period, were again laid to rest in 2016 in individual ossuary boxes in a smaller chamber within the crypt.</p>
      <p>Access issues has meant that up to now, the crypt has only been open to the public by special arrangement. However, new stairs have been built to enable access to the main crypt, from where the second one with its boxes containing the bones can be viewed.</p>
      <p>“Visitors currently come for the beach, the castle and to find out more about the Victorian heroine Grace Darling who lived in the village,” Jessica said.</p>
      <p>“There has been little in Bamburgh, however, that tells the story of its Anglo-Saxon past and the important role it played as a centre of learning, arts, culture and Christianity in the 7th and 8th centuries in what is now referred to as the Golden Age of Northumbria.</p>
      <p>“Little has been made of this period in Bamburgh’s history, when people travelled from far and wide to enjoy its rich cultural and religious heritage.</p>
      <p>“It really was a bright and shining age with the melting pot of cultures represented reflected in the likes of the Lindisfarne Gospels with its stunning mix of Celtic, Anglo-Saxon, Mediterranean and Arabic imagery and calligraphy.</p>
      <p>“The 7th and 8th centuries are often referred to as the Dark Ages, but in Northumbria it was an age of enlightenment. We need to remember that if St Aidan hadn’t come to Bamburgh, then we wouldn’t have had the Lindisfarne Gospels and many of the things we now take for granted, like Durham Cathedral and the wider North East’s Christian and cultural heritage.</p>
      <p>“It’s a story that is long overdue in being told, but the new Bamburgh Bones interpretation and digital ossuary goes a long way to rectifying that.”</p>
      <p>David Renwick, director, England North at the National Lottery Heritage Fund, said: “We are delighted that money raised by National Lottery players is enabling the fascinating archaeological finds in the Bamburgh area to be shared and explored more widely.</p>
      <p>“As we celebrate our 25th birthday, the opening of this new display in St. Aidan’s Church and Crypt is a wonderful present to receive.”</p>
      <p>Admission to St Aidan’s Church and Crypt is free. Opening hours are 9am-dusk.</p>
