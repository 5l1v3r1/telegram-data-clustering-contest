      <p><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/kang-daniel">Kang Daniel</a> has made his first comeback since solo debut!</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/wanna-one">Wanna One</a> center released his new single "<b>Touchin'</b>" on November 25 at 6 PM KST. The single has a pop sound inspired by the '80s and '90s fused with more modern EDM, rock, pop, and dance elements. The song is paired with a cinematic music video where Kang Daniel is imagined as something of a chic James Bond-esque film star.</p>
      <p>Due to his legal dispute with his former agency, he was unable to promote his previous release on television. However, for this comeback, he is scheduled to appear on <b>KBS</b>'s '<b>Music Bank</b>' and <b>SBS</b>'s '<b>Inkigayo</b>.' He is also currently considering performing at one of the major network's year-end concerts.</p>
      <p>Check out the music video for "Touchin'" above!</p>
