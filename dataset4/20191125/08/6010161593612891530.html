      <p>Cloning has been around in Farmville for years and it doesn’t look like Zynga is planning to actually do anything about it.</p>
      <p>Farmville cloning is the act of getting together with other players and timing the purchase of an item in such a way that it duplicates or doubles. This allows another player in your co-op group to list the item again, allowing you to buy it back and sell it once more.</p>
      <p>All you need to start cloning in Farmville is a co-op group of at least three players. Once you have that, here are the steps you need to follow to clone items:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First, the person who has the item must let everyone know they’re ready to clone by opening the chat window of a co-op session and asking everyone if they’re ready. Once they are, they can post the item on the co-op exclusive store, letting everyone in the chat know that the item is ready for purchase.</li>
        <li>Next, the other players need to open the co-op store, just above the chat window, and refresh the page until the item appears. Once it has appeared, do not refresh or you could lose it. Now stay on the store, but open up the chat window to let everyone know you can see the item. There should be at least two of you doing this same step.</li>
        <li>Once everyone is ready in chat, you all need to purchase the item at the same time. This duplicates the item and allows you all to buy it. Now one of the people who bought the item can repost it and you can repeat the steps above. If everyone in your co-op group does it, everyone should be left with more than they started.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can also clone with more than one item at a time. The process is exactly the same, but you need to refresh the store at the start until you see all the items the poster has put up.</p>
      <p>So, what about the ethics of Farmville cloning? According to Zynga, it is considered an exploit, but it’s very unlikely to get you banned. However, any progression issues you might bump into are on your head if they’re bugs caused by cloning.</p>
      <p>It’s also considered bad Farmville etiquette if you decide to leave before a round of cloning is done, and you don’t want to upset any Farmville mums, trust me.</p>
