      <p>Jose Mourinho has a reputation for being a very defensive, pragmatic coach, but his best sides have been built around a creative attacking midfielder, with Mesut Ozil, Deco, Cesc Fabregas, Oscar, Wesley Sneijder and Frank Lampard all playing their best football during his time with them.</p>
      <p>Dele Alli is next, or <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/west-ham-vs-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/">so his performance at West Ham in a 3-2 win certainly suggests</a>. Mourinho's tactical setup is perfectly suited to getting the most out of Alli, a player who works best in a direct system which allows him to act on instinct.</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino's Spurs had become overly patient and predictable by the end of his tenure, passing their way up the pitch even when it allowed opposition defences to get behind the ball and shut games down. Lacking the intense high-press of previous seasons, that Christian Eriksen has seemed distracted and out of sorts on the pitch has meant Spurs have also lacked their most creative outlet, kept quiet by teams sat in a low block as a result.</p>
      <p>Mourinho said before the West Ham game that he hadn't altered anything drastically,<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/20/will-spurs-play-josewhat-mourinho-can-bring-tottenham-tactical/"> but subtle tweaks in style were evident</a>. "Tactically not big changes," he told BT Sport. "[We've changed] little important things that we think can help to get our objectives."</p>
      <p>The most obvious of these were a shift to a 4-2-3-1, a change in personnel and a much more direct approach. Alli played behind Harry Kane in a role that meant he was both a second striker and a slightly deeper midfielder, like a 10... but not quite. Mourinho had his team shifting the ball up the pitch quickly, with Ben Davies forming a back three next to the centre-backs, Serge Aurier more advanced wide right, and Eric Dier and Harry Winks protecting the defence.</p>

      <p>This meant Spurs had five players behind the ball at all times and four forwards to ping passes to (with Aurier effectively an additional wide right), as though the team comprised two separate units of defence and attack. This prevented buildup and approach play being slowed down as everything went through midfield - even Paolo Gazzaniga was instructed to kick long rather than short from the back.</p>
      <p>The front four were expected to track runners and defend out of possession, but encouraged to run with the ball at their opponents when possible. Players in possession with space also looked to fire early passes in behind the back line and this is how Spurs constructed their opening goal against West Ham, with Alli dropping to receive a forward pass from an advanced starting position.</p>

      <p>A stepover and thumped shot later and Spurs had the lead. This chance was created with three passes - Davies to Winks, Winks to Alli, Alli to Son - and the sudden shift in gear caught West Ham out.</p>
      <p>Midfielders like Eriksen tend to drop into space so that they have a little more time to pick their next option and read the play, but by moving the ball more quickly through the lines, receiving players have to improvise instantly to find their next pass. Alli comes up with magic tricks on the spot.</p>
      <p>Pochettino knew this too but just couldn't coax the performances out of Alli he wanted and his varying team shapes - a 4-4-2 diamond the most common - weren't getting the most out of individuals he previously relied on. Alli played deeper as one of two '8s' in that diamond shape, involved in midfield build up rather than in position for the clever flicks that turns passing moves into attacks.</p>
      <p>That Alli has now had a run of games since returning from injury is relevant too but the shift in passing strategy by Mourinho clearly made a difference.</p>
      <p>West Ham's flimsy performance certainly helped make Spurs look good but Alli created chances and played others into play by following his instinct, exploiting a side slow to adapt and react. Joe Cole described the improvised pass which helped create Spurs' second goal as "street football"; the sort of thing Alli is capable of that cannot be coached.</p>

      <p>Alli computes complex solutions in a split second, times late runs into the box, and has a bit of a nasty streak. That ability to make the right decision without having to think about it is invaluable and what makes Alli special and for too long he has been without spark or fire. He is a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/22/find-edge-title-pursuit-liverpool-man-city-leicester-arsenal/">perfect Mourinho attacking midfielder</a> and this new, more direct style will suit his skillset perfectly.</p>
      <p>"I spent a few minutes with him in training and outside the pitch," Mourinho said after the match. "We were saying the best Dele has to be back. He is too good not to be a fundamental player for Spurs, he is too good not to be one of the best players in the world. He's a fantastic player and today he showed that."</p>
