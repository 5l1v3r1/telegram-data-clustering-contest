        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/frank-lampard/">Frank Lampard</a> believes that his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> team’s reaction to defeat against <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> on Saturday proves that they are ready to challenge for titles.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Blues took the lead at the Etihad in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> clash through N’golo Kante, but strikes from Kevin de Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez gave City the three points.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola’s side leapfrogged Chelsea into third in the table, with Lampard’s men dropping to fourth, but the Blues boss feels his team came away with plenty of credit in defeat.</p>
      <p>City ended the match with just 46.74% possession, the lowest of any side managed by Guardiola in any of his 381 top-flight matches in charge of a club.</p>
      <p>However, more than the performance, it was Chelsea’s reaction to defeat that proved to Lampard his players are suited to compete at the elite level.</p>

      <p>‘The feeling in the dressing room, it looked like they were very disappointed,’ Lampard told the <a href="https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2019/11/25/are-chelsea-exceeding-expectations--frank-lampard-has-his-say?cardIndex=0-0">official Chelsea website</a>. ‘That’s probably a simple answer, because we lost, but also I think they expect a lot of themselves.</p>

      <p>‘I think they will take an amount of confidence, but where we want to go to means that we might come here and win, and it might mean we can actually win titles going forward. I like to see them disappointed – it just shows the next question is the reaction we have.</p>
      <p>‘I expected us to compete in the game, because I’ve been watching us training daily, getting performances and playing well. I’m confident in the players we’ve got. I wanted us to win, so I probably haven’t changed my [long-term] mindset too much.’</p>
      <p>Chelsea are back in action in the Champions League on Wednesday night when they travel to take on Valencia, before a home game in the Premier League against another of Lampard’s former clubs, West Ham, on Saturday.</p>
      <p>‘I know this Premier League is hard and next week against West Ham will be a huge challenge, different to this, but we have to try and win it,’ continued the Blues boss. ‘I don’t want to jump ahead of ourselves. We’ll just go back to the training ground, back to our work and see where we can get to.’</p>
