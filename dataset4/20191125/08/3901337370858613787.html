        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Option 1: Angel Di Maria (2010-2014) </b>
      </p>
      <p>Tricky, quick and blessed with a wonderful left foot, Angel Di Maria will always be remembered as one of the standout performers in the iconic 2013/14 UEFA Champions League <i>La Decima</i> final against Atletico Madrid. During his time at Los Blancos, the Argentine scored 36 goals and racked up an impressive 85 assists in 190 appearances. He also won the UEFA Champions League, one LaLiga title, two Spanish Cups, one Spanish Super Cup, and one UEFA Super Cup with the Spaniards. With his added threat from set-pieces, Di Maria always posed a threat to the opposition.</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Option 2: Steve McManaman (1999-2003)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Versatile winger Steve McManaman endeared himself to the Santiago Bernabeu faithful through his dribbling ability and reliability in the team. In the 1999/2000 UEFA Champions League final, the Liverpudlian scored the second of three unanswered goals as Real Madrid defeated Valencia at the Stade de France. In 158 appearances for the club, McManaman scored 14 goals and earned 20 assists. His trophy cabinet includes two UEFA Champions League titles, two LaLiga titles, two Spanish Super Cups, one Intercontinental Cup, and one UEFA Super Cup.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Option 3: Cristiano Ronaldo (2009-2018)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo's Real Madrid career was characterised by one thing: goals. By the end of his nine-year stay at the club, he left as the club's all-time leading goalscorer. In 438 competitive matches, he scored an unprecedented 450 goals and handily assisted 131 times too. At Los Blancos, he won four UEFA Champions League titles, two LaLiga titles, three FIFA Club World Cups, three UEFA Super Cups, two Spanish Cups, and two Spanish Super Cups. He currently holds the record for the most goals scored in UEFA Champions League finals – he has four in total, with three of them coming in Real's colours.</p>
