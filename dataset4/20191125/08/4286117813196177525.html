      <p>On November 23, at around 6 in the morning, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar was woken up by a call from one of his party MLAs. It didn’t take the seasoned politician long to realise something was amiss. Especially after the MLA told him he was going to Raj Bhavan with his charismatic but controversial nephew, Ajit Anantrao Pawar. Two hours later, Ajit had been sworn in as deputy chief minister to Devendra Fadnavis, in a swiftly orchestrated ceremony.</p>
      <p>It is the first rebellion in the Pawar clan, but Ajit’s move is borrowed straight from his uncle’s playbook. Forty-one years ago, in 1978, Pawar had similarly turned the tables on the late Vasantdada Patil, walking out with 38 MLAs to bring down the coalition government of two rival Congress factions. He then went on to head a coalition government comprising the then Janata Party and the Peasants and Workers Party and ruled for two years till Indira Gandhi dismissed his government in 1980.</p>
      <p>Ajit has always had a blow hot, blow cold relationship with the Pawar strongman ever since he became the director of the Malegaon cooperative sugar mill in 1982. Son of Pawar’s second younger brother Anantrao, a film enthusiast, Ajit started shouldering the responsibility of his family consisting of his mother and younger siblings Shrinivas and Vijaya, after the untimely death of his father. He had to quit studies and take to farming to support the family. The elder residents of Katewadi, a village near Baramati in Pune, remember him carrying cans of milk on his Rajdoot motorcycle to sell at the Baramati market.</p>
      <p>Ajit’s political graph started rising after he was elected chairman of the Pune district cooperative bank in 1991. The senior Pawar had returned to the Congress by then and taken over as chief minister in 1989. In 1991, Ajit was elected to the Lok Sabha from Baramati on a Congress ticket. Soon, he vacated the seat to accommodate Pawar Sr, who later became defence minister in the P.V. Narasimha Rao government after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. As Sharad Pawar became the Baramati MP, Ajit came to represent the constituency in the state assembly. He also became the minister of state for agriculture and power in the Sudhakarrao Naik government. The communal riots of January 1993 following the demolition of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992 led to Naik’s ouster and the return of Sharad Pawar as chief minister. The senior Pawar opted to get elected to the Legislative Council this time, allowing Ajit to continue as an MLA and also making him the MoS for power.</p>

        <b>MORE FROM INSIGHT | <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/why-the-nationwide-nrc-proposed-by-amit-shah-is-being-criticised-1621483-2019-11-22">Why the nationwide NRC proposed by Amit Shah is being criticised</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>However, after losing the 1995 Maharashtra assembly election, Pawar returned as a Lok Sabha member and back into national politics, where he has remained since. It was around this time that Ajit started building his network. He nurtured Pawar’s ground work and also expanded Congress influence, especially in the rural areas of their home district, Pune. He soon emerged as Pawar’s political heir, acquiring an identity of his own.</p>
      <p>In 1999, in a surprise move, Pawar broke away from Congress yet again, this time invoking Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s foreign roots, and floated the NCP. A loyal Ajit followed suit, choosing to remain with his uncle. He became the minister for water resources (then called the irrigation department) the same year in the Vilasrao Deshmukh government. Ajit held the portfolio till 2010, the longest period by any minister. When Prithviraj Chavan became the CM, Ajit became his deputy and in-charge of the finance portfolio.</p>
      <p>His long stint in the water resources department, known as a breeding ground for corruption, malpractice and nepotism, made Ajit a controversial figure. He was held responsible for the incomplete irrigation projects, unjustified cost escalation of ongoing projects and an alleged nexus between the contractors and the politicians. His April 7, 2013 statement--If there is no water in the damshould we urinate into them?at a time the state was reeling under severe water scarcity met with trenchant criticism. To add to his woes, Chavan in a statement in July 2012 said that the state’s area under irrigation had grown up by only 0.1 per cent despite an expenditure of Rs 70,000 crore in a decade. That handed ammunition to then leader of opposition Eknath Khadse and prominent BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis to run a campaign against him alleging that he was involved in a Rs 70,000 crore scam in the water resources department. Ajit resigned in September 2012 only to return as deputy CM three months later.</p>
      <p>It was around this time that the senior Pawar seized the opportunity to sideline his beleaguered nephew in the party and clip his wings. He had already made daughter Supriya Sule return to India from Singapore in 2006, where she had settled with husband Sadanand Sule. Initially, NCP insiders say, Ajit did not take Supriya seriously. He realised she had arrived as a serious competitor only in 2009 when Pawar offered his Baramati Lok Sabha seat to her and chose to contest from nearby Madha instead. In September 2016, Pawar got Sule elected to the Rajya Sabha, indicating that she, not Ajit, would be his political heir.</p>
      <p>Ajit’s supporters believe he started drifting away from Pawar from May 26 this year when his son Parth lost the Lok Sabha election from Maval constituency. Pawar had opposed Parth’s candidature and, in a possibly covert message to his supporters to work against Parth, had publicly said that the BJP-Shiv Sena had not lost the seat in 50 years. Pawar, though, denies that Sule is the reason behind Ajit parting ways. She is interested in national politics. She won’t work in the state, he told reporters on November 23.</p>
      <p>Ajit is the only politician in Maharashtra who has been a deputy to three chief ministers--Ashok Chavan, Prithviraj Chavan and now Devendra Fadnavis. His supporters are puzzled why he has chosen to play second fiddle to a shrewd Fadnavis instead of the sober Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, who would have become chief minister had his party got the backing of the NCP and Congress. An insider says Pawar had made up his mind to appoint Ajit’s bête noire, Jayant Patil, as deputy CM in the three-party government. Patil, the state NCP president, was rooting for Sule as CM in a possible government. Ajit saw it as a threat to his future. He decided to align with the BJP in lieu of an assurance of getting the deputy CM’s post and setting aside an inquiry against him in the irrigation and Maharashtra state cooperative bank scams.</p>
