      <p>When I think back in my younger life it's hard to remember the exact dates when things happened in my life. I could not figure things out for the longest time then it all came to me. Once I realized when things occurred I saw how many people hand a hand in helping me through my life when times were rough. After telling my Uncle about the incident with the child molester he said to me, "No matter what always remember you did a good thing." His saying that has bought me through some rough times in my life it was right after that when my Mom and her boyfriend dumped me in a looney bin where I was stuffed with antipsychotic meds though nothing was wrong with me other than the facts I was physically, sexually, and mentally abused as a kid and I took a life in self-defense.  I should not have been taken to a Psyche hospital dumped there with no explanation and fed meds against my will the only thing it did was make me violent. I spent 3 months in one place and three months in aNUTter then I went to Beatty State Mental Institution for the Criminally Insane as a juvenile having no idea I was actually sentenced there till the age of 25 years old I was 14 when I got there. But I did not do the Eleven years I was supposed to do, I did 60 Days by the Grace of Dog and a lady name Mrs. MacArthur who went to the powers that were and told them I did not belong there. Then she contacted a Boys Home in Fort Wayne Indiana and got me in there saving my life, saving me from doing life. I bet she saved  other lives while  working there,  just one of those silent people who go through life helping other not expecting things in return.  The only thing we were allowed to watch in that place was Soul Train I used to hate watching Soul Train I never danced again after spending time in that place...October 1973 to January 1974 Give or take a day or so it was 60 Days from Maximum Security Lock Up to being able to come and go within reason for a juvenile. We were considered the worse juvenile offenders in Indiana all put in this Boys Home to see if maybe someday we could become productive citizens. There was the Boys Home and two Girls Homes because everyone knows girls get in more trouble so they had two girls homes...If it would not have been for Mrs. MacArthur you never woulda heard of Roger Dodger..</p>
