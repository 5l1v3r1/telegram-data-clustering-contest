          <p>During the fifth day of the first Test of the ongoing England’s tour of New Zealand in Mount Maunganui, England wicket-keeper batsman Jos Buttler committed a blunder against New Zealand fast bowler Neil Wagner to lose his wicket.</p>
          <p>It all happened on the first delivery of the 81st over when Buttler shouldered arms to an in-swinging yorker from Wagner. Looking absolutely clueless of his actions and the line and length of the delivery, Buttler had no other option than to walk back to the pavilion without even scoring a run in the 18 balls that he faced.</p>

                <p>Buttler was among the seven English batsmen who got out today as the visitors were bundled out for 197 in 96.2 overs. Coming on the back of scoring 615/9 dec. in 201 overs in the first innings, New Zealand won the match by an innings and 65 runs.</p>
                <p>Wagner, who was given the ball after all-rounders Colin de Grandhomme and Mitchell Santner last evening, registered his eighth five-wicket haul to propel his team to victory. Bowling figures of 19.2-6-44-5 made the 33-year old bowler as New Zealand’s best in the second innings.</p>
