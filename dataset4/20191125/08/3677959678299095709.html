      <p>Yesterday's $279.99 <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-friday-deal-10-2-inch-ipad-50-off-starting-at-just-279-99/">price drop</a> wasn't enough it seems as Apple has set a new bar, bringing the price down to just $249 for the new iPad 7.</p>
      <h3>10.2-inch iPad 7 Hits an All-Time Low of $249.99, Making Every Other Tablet Deal Look Bad</h3>
      <p>Even without any sort of discount applied, the iPad 7 is insane value for money. You get access to millions of apps, a buttery smooth OS experience thanks to iPadOS, and of course, a tablet that can potentially replace your laptop. All of this for just $329.</p>
      <p>It seems as though Apple wants to put its latest iPad 7 tablet in the hands of every single person out there. Therefore, it is now selling its new 10.2-inch display tablet for a price of just $249.99. Yes, that's right, you can save $79 on this already low-priced tablet. What a weird world we live in.</p>

      <p>Here's what you get for the price:</p>
      <blockquote>10. 2-inch Retina display<br/>A10 Fusion chip<br/>Touch ID fingerprint sensor<br/>8MP back camera, 1. 2MP FaceTime HD front camera<br/>Stereo speakers<br/>802. 11ac Wi-Fi<br/>Up to 10 hours of battery life<br/>Lightning connector for charging and accessories<br/>Support for Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil</blockquote>
      <p>The one thing that sets this iPad apart from the iPad 5 and iPad 6 is the inclusion of a slightly larger 10.2-inch display and a Smart Connecter for connecting Apple's very own Smart Keyboard accessory. With support for the original Apple Pencil, this tablet is almost invincible when it comes to churning out something creative.</p>
