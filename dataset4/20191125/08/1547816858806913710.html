      </p>
      <p>Bigg Boss 13 has been all about fights so far, but it seems, the environment is going to change. Looks like love is taking over the Bigg Boss 13 house. Asim Riaz, who showed off his aggressive side last week, is now a little mellow as he has fallen in 'love' with Himanshi Khurana. Hey, we are not making this up, he has confessed it himself. Last week, Shefali had sort of given a hint about Asim's growing fondness for Himanshi and now, the handsome hunk is even singing love songs inside the house.</p>
      <p>A recent Bigg Boss 13 update states that Asim will confess about his love for Himanshi Khurana to Arti Singh. And then he'll sing "Kyun Hota Hai Pyaar, Na Tum Jaano Na Hum" from Hrithik Roshan's Kaho Na Pyaar Hai. Well, well, that's some great bonding happening. BUT, let us also tell you that Himanshi is engaged and has spoken about her partner to Asim. So he knows pretty well that uska kuch ho nahi sakta. How much ever we love their chemistry inside the Bigg Boss 13 house, Asim and Himanshi will remain to be just 'good friends'. Asim's one-sided love will have to take a backseat.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, another great bonding that we are getting to see is between Sidharth Shukla and Shehnaaz Gill. Their amazing bond has got everyone talking and their fans want them to get married too. #SidnaazGetMarried is trending on social media after Mahhi Vij stated that she would love to see Shehnaaz as Sidharth's wife. That's too much of pyaar in BB 13 house, what's happening!Â </p>
