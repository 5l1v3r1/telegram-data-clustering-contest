      <p>When the founders of the Sneaker Laundry – a start-up in the CBD that cleans sneakers – wanted to give to the homeless at Christmas they looked to their own feet.</p>
      <p>“Me and my business partner had so many sneakers that never saw the light of day,” says co-founder Eugene Cheng. “What we realised was our customer base had a lot of collectors. A lot of people are massive sneakerheads who love buying more sneakers than they can wear.”</p>

      <p>Just before Christmas in 2017, the Sneaker Laundry put a call out for customers to donate shoes to the homeless. The response was “crazy”.</p>
      <p>Over two years people donated more than 200 pairs of sneakers, which the Sneaker Laundry painstakingly cleaned, disinfected and restored.</p>
      <p>“Our criteria was they be restored to a quality that anyone would wear, so people felt loved and not that they were receiving someone’s crap,” Mr Cheng says.</p>
      <p>In hindsight, that was the easy part. Far trickier was the process of distributing them to the homeless. “It was 40 degrees, stinking hot, and we were driving around in a van trying to find rough sleepers,” Mr Cheng says.</p>

      <h4>Heart and sole</h4>
      <hr/>
      <p>Some people they found were asleep, others were apprehensive of their overtures. In an entire afternoon they managed to give away just 10 pairs of sneakers.</p>
      <p>Their next attempt was in the laneway behind the Lighthouse Cafe in Bourke Street, which provides food for the homeless. This time they were mobbed.</p>

      <p>“We had no control of the situation,” Mr Cheng says. “We had no idea if people were getting the right size or if they were being distributed to the right people, or just passers by.”</p>
      <p>This year, with the support of Melbourne City Council, the Sneaker Laundry has partnered with Launch Housing, Melbourne City Mission’s Frontyard Youth Services and the Salvation Army to ensure the lovingly restored shoes are delivered – sensitively – to those who need them most.</p>
      <p>“We can confidently take on a lot of shoes and know they will reach the right people with the right sizing,” Mr Cheng says.</p>
      <p>Almost 25,000 Victorians are homeless according to the latest census data, with more than 300 people sleeping rough on the streets of inner Melbourne every night.</p>

      <p>Melbourne City Council says giving to homelessness organisations is the best way to make a difference to people sleeping rough this Christmas</p>
      <p>“The great thing about donating to homelessness support organisations is that they provide immediate help to people sleeping rough, but also crucial long-term support to help address the issues that led to homelessness,” says Cr Beverley Pinder.</p>
      <p>However Melbourne City Mission’s Wayne Merritt says that while this is the most effective way to help, he was aware some people want to give money directly to rough sleepers.</p>
      <p>“For some people, a direct hand over is what they like because they feel connected to that person,” Mr Merritt says.</p>
      <p>The caveat, he says, is that the money should be given with no expectation that it be spent in a certain way, such as on food or accommodation.</p>
