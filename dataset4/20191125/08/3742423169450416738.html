      <p>In a few short days, the world's biggest shopping event is set to return for another year. Over 96 bargain-filled hours, hundreds of retailers will be slashing their prices by up to 90% with some big-ticket items going for a fraction of their RRP. Here's everything you need to know, including the best sites to bookmark, online shopping tips and the dates to mark in your calendar.</p>
      <h3>What is Black Friday?</h3>
      <p>Black Friday is the biggest shopping events on the US calendar, with retailers offering huge, unheard-of discounts on thousands of consumer products. Over the past few years, Aussie retailers have been getting in on the action too - so expect to see plenty of deals from Myer, Big W, Target, Kmart.</p>
      <p>Australia's online merchants will also be embracing Black Friday. This includes Amazon, eBay, Catch and scores of lesser known e-stores.</p>

      <h3>When is Black Friday in Australia?</h3>
      <p>Black Friday officially takes place on the Friday after the US Thanksgiving holiday. In 2019, the date to mark in your calendar is <b>November 29</b>. However, as we have <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2019/10/you-dont-have-to-shop-on-black-friday-to-get-black-friday-deals">previously noted</a>, the actual sales period is a lot looser, with many retailers releasing deals in advance and/or extending their discounts well into the following week. (There's also the similar 'Cyber Monday' event on 2 Decemelber, which is specifically geared towards online-only deals.)</p>
      <p>In other words, you can expect plenty of bargains between November 26 and October 3 with the bulk of deals appearing on the aforementioned Friday and Monday. Also note that the US is a day behind us, which means their Black Friday lands on our Saturday - so keep an eye out for US deals that provide international shipping.</p>
      <h3>What sort of deals can we expect?</h3>
      <p>There's always an element of hyperbole attached to Black Friday, especially in the mainstream press. You should therefore take all those hysterical news reports about $5 large-screen TVs with grain of salt.</p>
      <p>With that said, there are always plenty of bargains on offer if you use judicious timing and know where to look. For example, it is likely Amazon and eBay will be running members-only flash sales on popular tech products. So you need to be prepared and you need to be fast.</p>

      <h4>eBay Black Friday deals</h4>
      <p>Alongside Amazon, eBay will have one of the biggest Black Friday sales in Australia. We're expecting some <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2018/11/ebays-ten-best-black-friday-deals/">absolutely killer bargains</a> as eBay's major partners look to beat last year's deals. For those who missed it, that included 50% off board games, up to 40% off big-brand TVs, 60% off bestselling video games and ultra-cheap fashion and footwear.</p>
      <h4>Catch Black Friday deals</h4>
      <p>Catch is always a good place to pick up a Black Friday bargain and 2019 should be no exception. If it's anything like last year, <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2018/11/catchs-best-black-friday-deals-for-2018/">Catch's Black Friday deals</a> should include Dyson vacuums, Google Home Minis, myriad fitness tracker and big brand sneakers.</p>
      <h4>Traditional retailers</h4>
      <p>As mentioned above, Australia's brick-and-mortar retailers will also be embracing Black Friday this year. You can expect to see big discounts from most of the old guard, including Harvey Norman, Big W, JB Hi-Fi, Target, The Good Guys, Myer, Kmart and various speciality stores like EB Games and Bunnings. If you'd prefer not to brave the crowds, most of the above merchants will also be running online sales. In fact, some have <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2019/10/shopper-alert-black-friday-just-came-early-at-big-w/">jumped the gun already</a>.</p>
