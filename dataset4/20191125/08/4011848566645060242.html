      <h1>Amazon Black Friday Deals for PS4 Consoles and Games</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:17:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.techtimes.com/reporters/k-navea" target="_blank">K Navea</a></address>
      <p>We are finally just days away from Black Friday, and the deals have been coming from major retailers. We've covered the best deals for the <a href="https://www.techtimes.com/articles/245957/20191108/ipad-cyber-monday.htm">latest 2019 iPad</a> (hint: it's at its lowest ever at $250, and we're hoping it might get even lower), the best price for a higher-end gaming laptop with the <a href="https://www.techtimes.com/articles/245986/20191112/this-asus-gaming-laptop-might-be-the-best-pre-black-friday-deal-you-can-get.htm">ASUS TUF FX505 </a>at $580 down $270 from retail, and even some <a href="https://www.techtimes.com/articles/246064/20191118/black-friday-2019.htm">console and game deals</a> for the Xbox, PS4, and the Nintendo Switch.</p>
      <p>But now we're going to do a comprehensive round-up specifically for PS4 users. The PS4 is priced better than ever before, and despite worries that it's soon to be replaced by the PS5, there are still a ton of games that we can't wait for. From <a href="https://www.techtimes.com/articles/245472/20190924/playstation-state-of-play-september-2019-the-last-of-us-part-ii-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-and-more.htm"><i>The Last of Us Part 2</i></a> and <a href="https://www.techtimes.com/articles/221970/20180227/cd-projekt-red-says-cyberpunk-2077-is-its-new-witcher-3-but-more-ambitious.htm">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, the PS4 will be going out with a bang next year, so it's definitely not too late to nab the console.</p>
