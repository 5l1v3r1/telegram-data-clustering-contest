      <h3>Those footsteps are too damn loud!</h3>
      <p>Another <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-4/">Call of Duty Modern Warfare</a> </i>patch dropped over the weekend, and among it tweaks was another attempt at addressing the volume of in-game footsteps.</p>
      <p>This recent patch “adjusted [the] volume and sound type played for crouch walk and walking while Aiming Down Sights,” Infinity Ward advised, hopefully lowering the sound exponentially. They’re way too loud at the moment, right?</p>
      <p>Full patch notes are below.</p>
