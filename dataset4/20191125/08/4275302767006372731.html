      <h1>Perth and Kinross school bosses manage to reduce teacher departures by half</h1>
      <h2>The number of teachers quitting their jobs at Perthshire secondary schools in the first term of this academic year has dropped by more than half.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:03:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/rossgardiner/" target="_blank">Ross Gardiner</a></address>
      <p>A Freedom of Information request by The Courier revealed seven teachers left their posts last term across all 11 secondary schools in the region.</p>
      <p>That compares to 15 departures at the same point last year.</p>
      <p>Perth and Kinross Council said it was the lowest level since 2016 and the authority had been working hard to attract and retain staff in the region’s classrooms.</p>
      <p>Of the 1,600 teaching positions in Perthshire primary and secondary schools, only half a dozen positions remained unfilled by the time the school term started in August.</p>
      <p>More than 80 members of teaching staff have handed in their notice each year since 2016/17.</p>
      <p>However in every year, more than half have done so at the end of the final summer term, often because they were retiring, which gives education bosses time to plan ahead and recruit replacements.</p>
      <p>Last year, however, 38 teachers moved on before June, which can make it more difficult to arrange teaching cover and prevent disruption to youngsters’ lessons.</p>
      <p>The council’s lifelong learning convener Caroline Shiers said this year’s statistics were “welcome and very positive.”</p>
      <p>The Conservative councillor said: “My message to all our teachers is how valued they are and how much of a positive contribution they make on a daily basis in ensuring high quality of education and the very best start in life for all our children and young people.”</p>
      <p>Council bosses say the local authority had “effective recruitment and resourcing arrangements in place” to fill vacancies which crop up.</p>
      <p>A Perth and Kinross Council spokesperson said the recruitment and retention of teachers and support staff was crucial to providing high quality education in all of its schools.</p>
      <p>“We offer a wide range of pastoral support, professional training and development opportunities and other benefits for all our employees,” the spokesperson added.</p>
      <p>“This includes supporting their health and wellbeing at an early stage through prevention, early intervention and focusing on resilience.  These opportunities and support may contribute to staff staying longer in post.”</p>
