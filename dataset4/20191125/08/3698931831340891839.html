      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:25:37+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.soyacincau.com/author/nic/" target="_blank">Nic Ker</a></address>
      <p>The Malaysian launch of the <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/xiaomi-mi-note-10">Xiaomi Mi Note 10</a> has been confirmed to be happening on the 3rd of December 2019, with the penta-camera device to be the first smartphone in the world to feature an ultra high-resolution 108MP camera.</p>
      <p>For those of you that can’t wait till then, the Mi Note 10 is essentially the global version of the <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/xiaomi-cc9-pro">Xiaomi CC9 Pro</a>, which is available in China—you can pick up a grey import set from a reputable reseller. But now, Xiaomi Malaysia is looking for 100 Mi Fans to become “Mi Experiencers” for the <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/xiaomi-mi-note-10-pro">Xiaomi Mi Note 10 Pro</a>—likely to be a better-specced variant of the Mi Note 10.</p>

At the rear, it has a 108MP f/1.69 main camera, a 5MP telephoto lens with 5X optical zoom, a 12MP telephoto camera with 2x optical zoom, a 20MP ultra wide-angle shooter, and a dedicated macro lens.</p>
