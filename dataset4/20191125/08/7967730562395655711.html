      <p>A day after climbing out of his Volkswagen SUV that flipped when he crashed into a parked car in Perth's south, star Fremantle forward Jesse Hogan has trained with his Dockers teammates despite the club giving him time off.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old was taken to hospital on Sunday where he was cleared of serious injury and discharged shortly afterwards after he clipped a parked car about 11am near teammate Joel Hamling's house on Waddell Road in Bicton.</p>

      <p>Hamling wasn't home at the time of the incident, which happened a few kilometres from Hogan's new home in Attadale.</p>
      <p>A witness called triple-0 and Hogan was taken to Fiona Stanley Hospital about 40 minutes later via ambulance. Firefighters also attended and cordoned the area but police did not attend the scene and were unable to provide further details on the crash.</p>

      <p>It is understood Hogan was the sole occupant of the car.</p>
      <p>The Dockers said Hogan was taken to hospital as a precaution, where the team doctor also examined him, and that he would be given Monday off training to recover, but the injured forward participated in running and ball drills and seemed untroubled by the accident.</p>
      <p>WA-born Hogan joined the Dockers on a three-year deal last year but his first season in purple was tainted by a recurrence of a navicular foot injury suffered against old club Melbourne in round 14 after playing 12 games with Fremantle.</p>
      <p>The Dockers were also forced to <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p515a5.html">suspend their superstar recruit on the eve of the season</a> last year after he missed training due to a drinking session.</p>
