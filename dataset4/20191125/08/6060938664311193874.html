      <h1>New Zealand's Trent Boult a concern ahead of second England Test</h1>

      <p>WELLINGTON: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/trent-boult">Trent Boult</a> will undergo scans on a rib injury to assess his fitness ahead of the second Test against England after the pace bowler missed much of the final day's play in New Zealand's victory over the tourists in the opening match at Bay Oval.</p>
      <p>Boult bowled just one over on Monday before leaving the field, though he was not needed with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Neil-Wagner">Neil Wagner</a> ripping through England's lower order as the hosts romped to an innings and 65-run victory.</p>
      <p>"At this stage not sure," captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kane-Williamson">Kane Williamson</a> told reporters when asked about Boult's injury. "He has a scan tomorrow and he is sore at the moment.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully the scan comes back clear but we'll have to wait and see."</p>
      <p>New Zealand have replacements for Boult if he is ruled out.</p>
      <p>Matt Henry operated as the substitute fielder on Monday while fast bowler Lockie Ferguson, who was released ahead of the game at Bay Oval, could make his debut at Seddon Park.</p>
      <p>Williamson also left the field late on Monday and after missing the Twenty20 series to rest a hip injury there were concerns it could have flared up again, with the batsman feeling his lower back and hip area as he walked off.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, another niggle. Just a bit sore down here," he said gesturing towards his hip. "I think it should be okay.</p>
      <p>"It's not the same (injury) but in a similar area.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully just a bit of a niggle."</p>
