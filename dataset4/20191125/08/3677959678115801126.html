      <h3>Amazon's Cheapest Alexa Speaker - Echo Dot - Goes Even Cheaper with its Crazy Black Friday 2019 Deal</h3>
      <p>The Echo Dot is probably one piece of hardware that exists on the entire planet that does not need any introduction at all to tech enthusiasts. It's a small hockey-puck shaped speaker that packs Alexa that can do countless things apart from being a normal speaker. Such as controlling your smart home, helping you with little tasks, settings alarms and timers, etc. In short, this tiny speaker packs a big punch and you can buy it for just $49.99.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Not today though.</i>
      </p>
      <p>For a limited time, and to celebrate Black Friday 2019, Amazon is bringing the price of the Echo Dot down to just $34.99, which represents a saving of $15 on the MSRP. But wait, the fun doesn't end here at all. If you buy three of these together, then you can spend just $64.97, which means that you actually end up paying close to $21 per Echo Dot in the 3-pack. We did tell you that this was a crazy deal! Just make sure to enter the code <i>DOT3PACK </i>at checkout in order to get the deal.</p>
