      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:13:46+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:13</time> by <a rel="author">Blair Marnell</a></address>
      <p>Last month, AMC released a teaser for the upcoming spinoff from <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-walking-dead"><b>The Walking Dead</b></a>. Now, The Walking Dead’s former showrunner turned Chief Content Offficer, Scott M. Gimple, has revealed that the new show is called <b>The Walking Dead: World Beyond</b>. The new series follows a generation who grew up in safety during the zombie apocalypse. However, their sense of security is shattered when they have to leave their old lives behind.</p>
      <p>Gimple made the announcement on his Instagram account with a picture of the script for the pilot episode. Apparently the first episode will be called “Brave.”</p>

      <p>Additionally, AMC has released a new trailer and announced more <b>World Beyond</b> cast members. Julia Ormond is very prominent in the footage as the apparent leader of a very well-equipped and well-armed faction. Natalie Gold will also co-star as Lyla,” a mysterious figure operating in the shadows on behalf of the cause she believes in.” Al Calderon will play Barca, with Scott Adsit as Tony, and Ted Sutherland as Percy.</p>
      <p>However, the bulk of the story appears to focus on the younger cast members, including Aliyah Royale as Iris, Annet Mahendru as Huck, and Alexa Mansour as Hope. Nicolas Cantu also stars in the series as Elton, alongside Hal Cumpston as Silas, and Nico Tortorella as Felix.</p>
      <p><b>The Walking Dead: World Beyond</b> will hit AMC in Spring 2020.</p>
