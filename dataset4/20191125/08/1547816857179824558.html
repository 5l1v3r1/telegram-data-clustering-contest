      </p>
      <p>Actor Aansh Arora gets a clean chit by the Ghaziabad police against the charge of attempt to murder. As per the FIR, six masked men barged into the 24/7 store (located in Shopprix mall sector 4 Vaishali) on the night of May 19, 2019 and threatened the staff members to withdraw the case filed against Aansh which they filed previously for the infamous quarrel they had and also fired gunshots.</p>
      <p>The whole incident was reported between 1-2 am, after which the Ghaziabad police registered FIR against Mr Aansh and the six masked people.</p>
