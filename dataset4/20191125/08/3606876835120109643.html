        <b>Hairstylist wako ni type gani?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Most of us have been to different salons to have our hair done. Even those who now have a specific hairstylist can bear witness that before they found that stylist, their hair had been through different hands.</p>
      <p>Particularly in Kenyan salons, you get to meet different types of stylists. And even though you might not have come across all these types, maybe you have met at least three or five of them.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. The ‘make money fast’ type</b>
      </p>

        </figure>
        <p>This salonist doesn’t care so much about the final look of the style. They are just there to make quick money. If they are plaiting your hair and another client who needs blow-drying shows up, they leave you first and attend to you after finishing with the blow-dry client.</p>
        <p>
          <b>2. The sick one</b>
        </p>

          <p>This one either has a cold or stomach issues. They will be sneezing and coughing all through and you have no doubt that by the time you are leaving, you will also be sick.</p>
          <p>
            <b>3. The rough one</b>

            <p>My God, this is the worst! To make matters worse, most of them are also rude. They tilt your head like a machine, burn your ears when heat styling your hair and scratch you with their long nails. Try say a word and you will have a lecture you will never forget.</p>

              <p>You will agree to meet at 9 am and they will show up two hours later. They will come running and panting giving all sorts of explanations just so that you forgive them.</p>

                <p>Whether you like it or not, this type cannot let you enjoy your silence. They make sure they involve you in every conversation they have with other people. They will be like, <i>“Customer hata wewe unaona hiyo kama ni vizuri kweli?”</i>(Customer, do you really think that’s good?)</p>
                <p>

                  <p>This one cannot stand to see clients go to another salon. They will be calling passers-by asking if they want their hair done. When they are doing your hair, they will also request if you can be their regular customer and if you can also refer your friends.</p>
