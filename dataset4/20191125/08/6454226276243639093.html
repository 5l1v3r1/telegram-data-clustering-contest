      <h1>Oil and gas company in voluntary administration and being chased for US$100 million by the Government, Tamarind, alerts Maritime NZ to tiny oil spill near its operation off the Taranaki coast</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:16:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:16</time> by <a rel="author">Jenée Tibshraeny</a></address>
      <p>A small amount of oil has been spilt about 60 kilometres off the coast of Taranaki, near a vessel used by an oil and gas operator that went into voluntary administration a fortnight ago.</p>
      <p>Twenty to 30 metres of oil was last Thursday (November 21) spotted about 400 metres from a floating oil and gas storage and offloading unit being used by Tamarind Taranaki.</p>
      <p>The unit, the Umuroa, is servicing the Tui field and is owned by BW Offshore.</p>
      <p>Maritime NZ was notified of the oil by Tamarind, but can’t confirm whether the Malaysian-headquartered company was responsible for the pollution.</p>
      <p>The situation prompted Maritime NZ to send a helicopter over the area on Thursday, and then a plane over the site on Friday morning - by which time the oil had naturally dispersed.</p>
      <p>While there was only a tiny amount of oil spilt, Maritime NZ said it’s rare for oil to be found in the water near oil and gas fields.</p>
      <p>“Flyovers due to oil on the water in Taranaki are not common because they are seldom needed,” it said.</p>
      <p>It confirmed Tamarind’s safety plans and insurance were still in place, despite it going in to voluntary administration on November 11.</p>
      <p>A senior manager at Borrelli Walsh, the Singaporean firm appointed Tamarind’s voluntary administrator, Éanna Brennan, told interest.co.nz the company had about 100 creditors. They are <b><a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=12287264">reportedly</a></b> claiming $198 million.</p>
      <p>The Government also claims it’s owed US$100 million by Tamarind, as under the conditions of its permit, the Crown is obliged to meet about 42% of the costs incurred decommissioning its wells at the Tui field.</p>
      <p>Because Tamarind went in to voluntary administration before doing the decommissioning, the Government wants its money back.</p>
      <p>Tamarind had hoped to squeeze a bit more oil/gas out of the wells, which are at the end of their life.</p>
      <p>Its administrators are looking in to whether they can attract investment to keep production going at Tui for a bit longer, before decommissioning.</p>
      <p>Energy and Resources Minister Megan Woods said: “It’s very concerning to me that there’s a possibility taxpayers may be on the hook for decommissioning.</p>
      <p>“We’re also monitoring closely to ensure there is proper oversight of the health and safety situation there.”</p>
      <p>Woods amended the Crown Minerals Act in 2018, in the wake of Tamarind in 2017 buying AWE Taranaki - the permit operator of the Tui field.</p>
      <p>Because the transaction meant there was a change of company control, rather than a change of operator, it didn’t need government approval.</p>
      <p>It effectively gave Tamarind backdoor access to Tui, as AWE only needed to notify the Minister of Energy and Resources of the change after it occurred.</p>
      <p>Woods said that under the new law, companies that seek to buy existing assets need to prove they are "capable of running them responsibility".</p>
