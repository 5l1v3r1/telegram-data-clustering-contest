      <h3>Bitcoin comes within an inch of $6,500</h3>
      <p>Data from Coin360 shows BTC/USD bouncing off the significant $6,500 barrier, having fallen 7% in the past 24 hours. </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrency’s</a> weekly downturn currently stands at more than 20% versus the same point last week, while monthly, investors have taken a 30% hit on holdings.</p>

      </p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-diary-shorting-btc-is-dangerous-so-i-went-long-at-69k">reported</a>, current moves are essential in deciding whether bulls have a chance of preserving influence. If not, little remains in the way of Bitcoin dropping as low as $2,500. </p>
      <p>Commentators will be keenly eyeing $6,500 in particular, as this figure represents the assumed cut-off point for miner profitability. Previously, analysts had claimed miners would <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-miners-will-defend-price-above-6-500-ahead-of-halving-analyst">defend</a> that price should Bitcoin fall within its range. </p>
      <p>At press time, that theory appeared to hold, with an upwards reversal taking Bitcoin to $6,700.</p>
      <p>As an indicator of sentiment among professional traders, regular Cointelegraph contributor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/michael-van-de-poppe">Michaël van de Poppe</a> said that longer-term, Bitcoin still remained a firm best choice.</p>
      <p>“Whatever movements there are now (whether we go back to $7,800 prior to any further downwards movements), I do believe that the asset $BTC is one of the few bullish assets macro wise for the coming years,” he said in his latest <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1198637799345397762">Twitter update</a> late on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Van de Poppe added he would remain satisfied if markets bottomed in the low $6,000 range.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, theories explaining Bitcoin’s loss of momentum ranged from the commonplace China exchange crackdown to one involving the United States. As Adamant Capital founder <a href="https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1198667347151740928">Tuur Demeester</a> noted, U.S. investors could be deliberately forcing the market lower in order to record negative performance for their end-of-year tax obligations.</p>
      <p>Short-term performance could also improve thanks to a “gap” in CME Group’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-futures">Bitcoin futures</a>. As noted, when futures begin trading at a different price to that at which they closed their previous session, Bitcoin tends to “fill in” the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cme-bitcoin-futures-chart-posts-another-gap-to-fill-near-8-900">resulting vacuum</a> later. That blank spot currently sits at around $7,300.</p>
      <h3>Altcoins see red with 10% fall</h3>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/altcoin">Altcoin</a> markets predictably suffered as a result of Bitcoin’s weakness. As the week began, most cryptocurrencies in the top twenty by market cap shed almost 10%.</p>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), the largest altcoin, fell 9.8% to hit $136, its lowest price since Apr. 1 this year. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Others, such as Litecoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ltc-price-index">LTC</a>), managed to stave off the worst of the bearish sentiment to deliver more moderate losses of around 5%.</p>
      <p>The overall cryptocurrency market cap also erased a significant chunk of its value, falling to just $183 billion at press time with Bitcoin’s share at 66.2%.</p>
