      <p>Nothing like ice magic, some great singing and Disney money to break some more box office records.</p>
      <p>As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/frozen-2-opening-weekend-china-global-international-box-office-results-1202791912/amp/?__twitter_impression=true">Deadline</a>, <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/theres-so-much-more-to-love-in-frozen-ii"><i>Frozen 2</i></a> has jumped past the competitors to cement itself as the largest-opening animated film of all time, grossing a worldwide global debut of $516 million. Most of this money, notably, came from the international market, where it raked in $329 million across 37 international markets since its opening on Friday.</p>
      <p>In China, the film made $78 million, for the 3rd best animated debut ever and the best Disney animated debut; Korea came in next with $46 million and another record as 3rd highest industry opening, period; and behind trailed Japan, Germany and a bunch of other countries.</p>
      <p>In the U.S., the film hit approximately $184 million. Which goes to show: people, around the world, <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/the-team-behind-frozen-ii-still-marvels-at-the-success-of-the-original">really really like</a> <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/10/deciding-to-make-frozen-2-was-much-more-complicated-than-youd-expect"><i>Frozen</i></a>. While Disney franchises like <i>Star Wars</i> might not be as popular overseas as they are in the States, <i>Frozen</i> is proving a reliable name for the company.</p>
      <p>Oh, and if you want to adjust for inflation, the <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/frozen-ii-revives-box-office-pushes-disney-past-3-billion-in-2019-domestic-grosses/">U.S. opening</a> is fourth ever. <i>The Lion King</i> is still on top in that race.Â </p>
