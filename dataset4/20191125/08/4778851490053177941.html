      <p>Hearts are "clueless" in their hunt for a new manager, according to former Hibs attacker Kris Commons.</p>

      <p>The Sky Sports pundit believes Ann Budge is "making it up as she goes along" as she seeks to find a replacement for manager Craig Levein and a sporting director.</p>
      <p>The Hearts owner has previously stated she will take her time in appointing the next head coach as she wishes to fully evaluate all the candidates.</p>
      <p>However, pressure is building on the board to make an appointment after Saturday's 3-0 thrashing at Kilmarnock under the stewardship of interim boss Austin MacPhee.</p>
      <p>Commons insists Budge is "dragging her heels" over the decision.</p>

      <p>He wrote in the Daily Mail: "Look at Spurs. Some of their fans would have gone to work and started a night-shift last week with Mauricio Pochettino in charge of their club. Then, by the time they got home the next morning, he'd been punted and replaced by Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>"That's how clubs operate when they have a clear and definite plan of action...they act swiftly and make a change.</p>
      <p>"Hearts, though, are a million miles from that. They're clueless and Ann Budge is basically making it up as she goes along. She's dragging her heels over appointing a new manager and a sporting director.</p>
      <p>"Meanwhile, they are being hammered 3-0 at Kilmarnock. That's patently not good enough."</p>
