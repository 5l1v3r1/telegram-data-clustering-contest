      <h1>Got grille? New BMW M3 and M4 to look 'very' different to base models...</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:40:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.carmag.co.za/author/ryanbubear/" target="_blank">Ryan Bubear</a></address>
      <p>The head of the BMW M division says the new M3 and M4 will “differentiate very much” from the base models in terms of styling, suggesting both will indeed feature dramatic new interpretations of the German brand’s signature kidney grille.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/22/m-boss-confirms-2021-bmw-m3-m4-will-differentiate-very-much-from-base-models/"><i>BMWBlog</i></a>, BMW M CEO Markus Flasch described the M3 and M4 as “legends”.</p>
      <p>“The cars will differentiate very much from the base models. We have gone to a greater extent than we have done in the past. The cars look phenomenal,” Flasch promised.</p>
      <p>According to the report, the upcoming G80-generation M3 and the G82-generation M4 will each feature a “very large kidney grille” (as suggested by photographs leaked earlier in 2019), although there will apparently be slight design differences between the two.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/new-models/got-grille-bmw-concept-4-previews-the-next-generation-4-series/">BMW Concept 4</a>, of course, was revealed in September 2019, featuring a bold new version of the brand's kidney grille and effectively previewing the next-generation 4 Series. And this perhaos gives us an indication of what BMW is planning.</p>
      <p>In October 2019, Flasch revealed the new M3 and M4 were set to hit showrooms only in 2021, although added the Munich-based firm “would have the <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/rumours/new-bmw-m3-and-m4-will-boast-most-powerful-engine-in-segment/">most powerful engine</a> in the segment”. He furthermore confirmed manual and automatic variants had been developed, alongside rear-driven and all-paw models.</p>
