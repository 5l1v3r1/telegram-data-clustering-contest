      <p>Cape Town - <b>Banyana Banyana</b> and coach <b>Desiree Ellis</b> have been nominated for the <b>CAF Women's Team of the Year</b> and the<b> Women's Coach of the Year </b>award.</p>
      <p>Ellis guided South Africa to the <b>2018 CAF Women's Africa Cup of Nations</b> final in December last year but lost the final to rivals Nigeria.</p>
      <p>However, they qualified for the <b>2019 Women's FIFA World Cup </b>in France but failed to advance beyond the group stages.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <b>Pitso Mosimane</b> was shortlisted for the <b>Men's Coach of the Year</b> award as he guided Mamelodi Sundowns to the Absa Premiership title last season, as well charging them forwarded to a CAF Champions League semi-final.</p>
      <p>Mosimane faces some stiff competition for the award with 2019 African Cup of Nations winning coach Djamel Belmadi also on the ballot, along with Senegal head coach Alious Cisse and Nigerian mentor Gernot Rohr.</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old won the award back in 2016 after leading the Brazilians to the CAF Champions League trophy.</p>
      <p>Even though he did not achieve a similar feat in 2019, the on-going success he brings to Sundowns season after season makes him a strong contender to win the award for a second time.</p>
      <p>One fact that may play against him though is the fact that Kaizer Chiefs are running away with the league title this season.</p>
      <p>While the side's current performance will not officially be considered for the 2019 Coach of the Year award, it is difficult to ignore how far behind Chiefs they are after the first third of the season.</p>
      <p>Amakhosi have played 11 games to Sundowns 10 but hold a massive 10-point lead after winning nine, drawing one and losing just one of those games to set the pace on 28 points.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Denis Onyango and Themba Zwane have also been nominated for a CAF award.</p>
      <p>Onyango's impressive run as the Brazilians' number one shot-stopper has seen him earn a nomination on the African Player of the Year.</p>
      <p>Also, former Brazilian and team-mate Percy Tau was also shortlisted for the accolade.</p>
      <p>Star Banyana Banyana players Refiloe Jane and Thembi Kgatlana have made the cut for the Women’s Player of the Year.</p>
      <p>The national women's team have also been shortlisted for the CAF Women's Team of the Year.</p>
      <p>The CAF awards will take place in January 2020 with the official date to be confirmed.</p>
