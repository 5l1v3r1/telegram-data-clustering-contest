      <h1>Why Christine Ohuruogu does not wade into doping debates: 'I never cast aspersions - not with my history'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/pippa-field/" target="_blank">Pippa Field</a></address>
      <p>Given this was her first full season officially retired from athletics, Christine Ohuruogu still took up a large amount of column inches this summer, in particular around the time of the World Athletics Championships in Doha.</p>
      <p>Some were a welcome reference – a proud associate of the exclusive British female athletics world champions winners club, membership of which grew by one to seven following <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2019/10/02/dina-asher-smith-goes-200m-gold-world-athletics-championships/">Dina Asher-Smith’s gold in the 200 metres.</a></p>
      <p>Other references evoked less glorious memories. Prior to the championships, much of the build-up was dominated by American sprinter <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2019/08/24/christian-coleman-aiming-race-world-championships-despite-missing/">Christian Coleman facing a potential doping ban after allegedly committing three whereabouts violations in 12 months.</a> Coleman successfully protested that one of his failures should be backdated, the United States Anti-Doping Agency dropped the case and he went on to win the world title in Doha.</p>
      <p>But with Ohuruogu one of the highest profile athletes to have fallen foul of the whereabouts rule herself, having served a 12-month ban in 2006 following three missed drugs tests before returning to win 400m Olympic gold and two world titles, her previous misdemeanours were dug back up and her name often featured in articles about Coleman.</p>
      <p>"It is three missed tests, he had three missed tests. It’s a story, it’s going to be linked, it’s going to be one of those things that happen," states Ohuruogu matter-of-factly.</p>

      <p>"My issue was over 10 years ago, with a different system, even though it’s the same infraction. Mine was a pilot test. I mean we were sending stuff by faxes for crying out loud. And post. It’s a different system.</p>
      <p>"You could argue that it’s a lot harder to miss a test now, but that’s neither here nor there. You have to be careful with what you say, you have to understand the context."</p>
      <p>Led by her own experiences 13 years ago and perhaps also guided by the teachings of her recently acquired law degree, Ohuruogu knows to be careful in her choice of words.</p>
      <p>It is the same when she reflects on the women’s 400m world final and how Bahrain’s Salwa Eid Naser destroyed the field with a stunning 48.14 sec run – the third fastest time in history and quickest in 34 years – to take gold.</p>
      <p>"That was a phenomenal performance. Even now, I’m not really sure how to relate to that run: 48.1 is something I do not know what to do with … It’s not something I thought I would have seen in the time I’m seeing it happen," she remarks.</p>
      <p>Is she, therefore, suggesting it was a time not borne out of purely natural talent?</p>

      <p>"Are you trying to put words in my mouth?" she fires back. "You’ve got to be careful with how you approach performances.</p>
      <p>"Just because you can’t conceive it, doesn’t mean it’s not possible and that’s what we have to be careful about. You have to be careful when you compare times, you have to look at how the champs have been run, you’ve got to look at recovery; recovery plays a huge factor. When you factor in the fact they had time off between rounds, maybe that’s where she got the extra energy from.</p>
      <p>"I’m never one to throw aspersions on anyone, with my history, I know what that feels like and I would never do that to anyone else."</p>
      <p>It is the same with Coleman. Ohuruogu says she has not followed the case at length and will only conclude: "I don’t have a public role where I need to say anything. Sometimes you just let other people take the baton and deal with it."</p>
      <p>Instead, she prefers to draw on her own experiences to show how split-second judgments on athletes should be avoided.</p>
      <p>"I get a bit frustrated when people throw out their two-minute hot takes on this and that and I think, ‘You don’t really know what you’re talking about’," she says.</p>
      <p>"Yes, I had the three-missed-test infraction but I had a real sense of, I don’t know what to call it … I had people who took the time to understand me and figure out what was going on and that’s really what saved me and helped me continue in my career.</p>
      <p>"Not everybody is evil and trying to deceive. People do. And that’s one thing to understand. But there’s another part where you have to understand that people are not trying to deceive, people just have chaotic lives. Try and be a bit more human with your assessment, don’t just assume. Loads of drama happened to me, that’s my life, I think chaos just seems to follow me."</p>
      <p>Having announced her retirement in June last year after a 14-year professional career, you might assume the chaotic lifestyle might be a thing of the past for Ohuruogu. Immediately after stepping away from the track, she set about completing her law degree, graduating this August, with the plan to then "take a year off just to decompress" before continuing her legal training. Except life in the slow lane is more difficult than she imagined.</p>
      <p>"I had it in my mind that it’s time for me to do all the stuff I haven’t been able to do in the last few years. I gave myself a year off just to have some transition time. It’s not that fun actually. I’m just used to doing stuff. I can’t possibly see my life doing nothing," she admits, echoing the experiences of many athletes in adjusting to life post-retirement.</p>

      <p>Inevitably, given her character, she is busy filling her schedule again. Holiday out of the way, there is house decorating to do and she recently joined fellow Olympic and Paralympic medallists in marking the 25th anniversary of the National Lottery, showcasing the 864 medals won by athletes since elite funding began.</p>
      <p>Another undertaking is her mentoring role to athletes in the British team although for now, she insists, she is happy to stay in the background.</p>
      <p>Asher-Smith is one who appreciates the advice, having previously referred to Ohuruogu as "Queen Chrissy" and "forever my inspiration".</p>
      <p>Ohuruogu returns the compliment when she describes Britain’s latest sprint sensation as "an ultimate talent".</p>
      <p>It was in August 2007, in just her seventh race of the season after returning to action earlier in the month following her year-long ban, that Ohuruogu won the first of her two world titles. A year later, Olympic gold followed. So does she think Asher-Smith can enjoy the same golden double? "I’m never one for making predictions. It’s not fair on the athlete."</p>
      <p>Instead she elaborates on her own experiences. "For me and my coach, 2007, we just reran the same script in 2008," she recounts. "When people go for the big improvements, that’s when they cause problems for themselves. Think about small improvements.</p>
      <p>"Dina will know how to work towards the Games. I always tell her if she needs anything, she knows where to find me."</p>
