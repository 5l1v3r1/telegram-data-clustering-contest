      <p>It was all kicking off on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! last night, but no one could have foreseen the spat between fiercely competitive <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-haskell/">James Haskell</a> and Ant and Dec.</p>
      <p>During last night’s live trial, James and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/roman-kemp/">Roman Kemp</a> failed to win stars – aka a roast dinner – for Ian Wright, Andy Whyment and Cliff Parisi in what <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/im-celebrity-fans-demand-justice-james-haskell-roman-kemp-impossible-bushtucker-trial-11212111/">viewers called an ‘impossible task’.</a></p>
      <p>The pair were stuck when a crab refused to let go of a star which threw the entire Bushtucker Trial into disarray.</p>

      <p>However, James unexpectedly <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/im-celebritys-james-haskell-loses-cool-ant-dec-impossible-bushtucker-trial-11213079/">took his frustration out on Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly</a>, which was painfully awkward for everyone involved.</p>
      <p>‘That was unlucky. What was it James?’ Dec, very cool and calmly, asked the rugby ace.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘What was it?’ James snapped. ‘It was the very fact there was a giant crab in the way that you wanted me to carefully caress in a different direction as I tried to unscrew a star in its face.’</p>
      <p>Naturally, the Ant and Dec were still reeling from the clash on Extra Camp.</p>

      <p>‘How angry did James get at the end there?’ gasped host Emily Atack.</p>
      <p>Ant chuckled: ‘He had a little go at Dec, didn’t he.’</p>
      <p>Doing an impression of James, which he would no doubt never do to the athlete’s face, Dec moaned: ‘Well it’s all about the crab you wanted me to caress!’</p>
      <p>But that wasn’t the only source of tension last night as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/im-a-celebritys-kate-garraway-ian-wright-and-james-haskell-clash-over-chivalry-of-all-things-11211775/">James also locked horns with Good Morning Britain presenter Kate Garraway</a>, who didn’t want preferential treatment going to the live trial because she’s a woman.</p>
      <p>And then Ian and Andrew Maxwell had to have a bizarre bicker over what appeared to be nothing, just because.</p>
