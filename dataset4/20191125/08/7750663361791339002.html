      <h1>Kubica 'cheerful' as F1 race career ends</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/robert-kubica/"><b>Robert Kubica</b></a> is in a "very good mood" even though he is bowing out of Williams and Formula 1.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:03:59+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:03</time> by <a rel="author">GMM F1</a></address>
      <p>It is expected that the Pole will race elsewhere in 2020, whilst potentially serving as <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/force-india/"><b>Racing Point</b></a>'s new F1 reserve driver.</p>
      <p>However, former driver Christian Danner - now a commentator - told the German broadcaster RTL that Kubica remains chirpy.</p>
      <p>"I saw him in the paddock in Brazil and he was in a very good mood," he said.</p>
      <p>"It was very nice to see that a driver who basically loses every race despite doing a good job, but is not necessarily always treated well by his team, is still cheerful," Danner added.</p>
      <p>"In my opinion he is already finished with Formula 1, so he's enjoying it for the last races now."</p>
      <p>Danner says Kubica can be "proud" that he made it all the way back to Formula 1 despite almost losing his right arm in a horror 2011 rallying crash.</p>
      <p>"That is why he is a cheerful and contented man rather than a bitter and frustrated one," he said.</p>
