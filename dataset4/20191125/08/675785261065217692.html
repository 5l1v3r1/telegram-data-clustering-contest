      <p>Two prisoners’ who murdered four inmates in plot to get the death penalty instead of serving their life sentences have seen their plans backfire.</p>
      <p>Denver Simmons, 38, and Jacob Philip, 28, were already serving life for unrelated double murders.</p>
      <p>Now the pair each have six life sentences instead of the death penalty after the victims’ families objected to them being executed, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7720809/Two-prisoners-kill-FOUR-fellow-inmates-hoping-death-penalty-instead-receive-jail-time.html">Daily Mail reports.</a></p>
      <p>The execution of William Scruggs, 44, Jimmy Ham, 56, Jason Kelley, 35, and John King, 52, was carried out at the maximum security facility Kirkland Correctional Institution in Columbia, United States, in 2017.</p>

      <p>Speaking at the hearings at Richmond County courthouse on Thursday, Dan Goldberg, Deputy 5th Circuit Solicitor, said: “The four families were unanimous in that they did not want to pursue it.</p>
      <p>“The families would rather they be in prison than give them what they wanted.”</p>
      <p>The court heard how the pair lured the men into Simmons’ prison cell on the promise of cookies and drugs.</p>
      <p>Once in the cell, they strangled the inmates one at a time with an electrical cord and a broomstick tourniquet, <a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/local/crime/article237666419.html">The State reports.</a></p>
      <p>During a series of phone calls in 2017, Simmons recalled the horrific murder plot that he and Philips had planned.</p>
      <p>They personally had nothing against the men they killed. Simmons admitted that one of them was a friend.</p>
      <p>Simmons said: "I'd always joke with him [Philip] - from back in August and September and October of 2015 - that if we weren't going to kill ourselves, that we could make a name for ourselves, so to speak, and get the death penalty.</p>
      <p>"At the end of March of this year (2017), he was willing to do it. So, we just planned to do it. And we did it".</p>
      <p>Evidence shows the killings took place over a two-hour period in Simmons’ cell. Scruggs entered the cell thinking he would be treated to some cookies, and Ham was lured by the promise of snorting some crushed pills.</p>
      <p>They were being housed in a unit for inmates who need significant mental health help but whose conditions aren't serious enough to require hospitalisation.</p>
      <p>Throughout their time in custody the pair had a relatively clean record and they were made ‘doorkeepers’ for their units. This meant their doors were left open while others were locked.</p>
      <p>Simmons and Philip chose men who trusted them, to make their expedition easier.</p>
      <p>Simmons said: “This is the part that's gonna sound bad. They [victims], they trusted us. We talked to these people every day. One of them was a friend of both of ours. And they just trusted us. We come up with something for each one.”</p>
      <p>After the mass murders, Simmons and Philip walked down a prison hall until they found a healthcare counsellor and told him, “You might want to go check cell 261 when you get a second.”</p>

      <p>Mr Goldberg told how they “didn’t try to run or hide or anything.”</p>
      <p>Prison staff found one body under the bed, two on top of the bed, and one on the floor .</p>
      <p>Richland County Coroner Gary Watts told reporters he had never heard of four murders taking place inside a state prison at one time.</p>
      <p>Simmons was asked by a legal team why he did not commit suicide, if prison life was unbearable.</p>
      <p>He said he'd tried: “You know, killing yourself is, it sounds easy. It's really hard. Your body even fights you when you cut yourself.”</p>
      <p>Both men were already service two life sentences after each had been convicted for the murders of a woman and her child in separate incidents.</p>
      <p>Philip was arrested in 2013 for killing his 26-year-old girlfriend and her 8-year-old daughter in Berkeley County. He pleaded guilty in 2015 as part of an agreement in exchange for life without parole, according to the clerk of court records.</p>
      <p>Simmons murdered Sheila Dodd, 45, and her 13-year-old son in Colleton County, South Carolina, in 2007. He pleaded guilty in exchange for two life sentences.</p>
      <p>After pleading guilty to the newest slaughters, they each now have six life sentences.</p>
