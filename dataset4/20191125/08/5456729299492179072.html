      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:14:19+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/nwest/365077-reporters-students-others-lose-properties-to-fire-in-bauchi.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>Abdul-Saheed Olaide, a reporter with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), and some of his neighbours lost their property in a fire that razed their residence in Gwalameji, a suburb of Bauchi, on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The other victims are David Adenuga, a reporter with The Nation Newspapers, and some students of the Federal Polytechnic, Bauchi.</p>
      <p>The victims said the source of the fire, which reportedly started at 1.30 p.m. from a bush behind the building was not known but that it destroyed nine rooms.</p>
      <p>Mr Olaide said that the fire burnt his work tools and other valuables but expressed gratitude to God that he was still alive.</p>
      <p>”I thank God for my life that it did not happen at night. It happened like a joke, many things have gone which I cannot mention right now,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Adenuga said: ”It is like a dream. I cannot believe that everything in my room has gone. I lost all my belongings to the fire.</p>
      <p>”There was no light at the time; we still don’t know the source of the fire.</p>
      <p>“The fire affected nine rooms. It took the efforts of the Fire Service to put out the fire that already spread to other blocks,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Adenuga said all his certificates and other valuables were burnt in the fire.</p>
      <p>”I don’t know where to start, what to do; I don’t have anywhere to go. I am only left with the clothes on me,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>A witness, Musa Sule, told reporters the incident started around 1:30p.m. from one of the rooms at Tinubu Lodge.</p>
      <p>Mr Musa said cooking gas in the rooms might have contributed to the escalation of the fire, saying most of the rooms contained gas cylinders which exploded while the fire raged.</p>
      <p>Another victim, Goodness Okpara, a student, said she was in the church when she received a call informing her of the incident.</p>
      <p>“Actually, we are three occupants in the room. We were able to save our mattress and some things.’’</p>
      <p>She, however, described the incident as an act of God. (NAN)</p>
