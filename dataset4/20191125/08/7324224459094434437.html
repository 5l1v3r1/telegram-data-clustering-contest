      <h1>Wolves skipper Conor Coady thrilled to be on Raul Jimenez's side</h1>
      <h2>Conor Coady is glad he does not have to mark Wolves' hot-shot Raul Jimenez as he hailed the forward's attitude.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:30:19+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/rosie-swarbrick/" target="_blank">Rosie Swarbrick</a></address>
      <p>Jimenez jetted back from international duty with Mexico in South America to net his 14th goal of the season in gold and black against Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>That helped clinch a 2-1 victory and centre-half Coady is thrilled is to be in the same colours as the in-form hot-shot.</p>
      <p>He said: "I'm glad I don't have to mark him, I'm glad he's on my team.</p>
      <p>"He is a sensational footballer, we were training on Friday and he does things in training you just do not expect people to do.</p>
      <p>"He just hears a shout and can find people or score goals from unbelievable positions.</p>
      <p>"He's a sensational footballer."</p>
      <p>Jimenez had a 12-hour flight back from South America before Saturday's trip to the South coast.</p>
      <p>The forward was given the last international break off due to his workload and Coady said he was concerned when he returned from that mini rest.</p>
      <p>But as he made it eight in eight appearances for club and country on Saturday Coady saw a difference in this return.</p>
      <p>He said: "It is stupid, it is absolutely crazy the amount of travelling he does.</p>
      <p>"He goes and plays, never moans, he does everything right.</p>
      <p>"After the last international break he came back and looked knackered, he looked tired and we worry.</p>
      <p>"But this one he has come back all bubbly and you could see he was looking forward to getting back in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>"You could see that on Saturday with the way he moved, harries, chases people down and brings so much to this football club.</p>
      <p>"It is a pleasure to have him here it really it is."</p>
      <p>Jimenez's goal gave Wolves a 2-0 lead as they built on Joao Moutinho's 21st-minute opener.</p>
      <p>Simon Francis was sent off for Bournemouth in the 37th minute for a second foul on Diogo Jota but Wolves would concede in the second half.</p>
      <p>The Cherries' Steve Cook nodded home a Nathan Ake corner and Coady wants his men to learn from that.</p>
      <p>Coady said: "I thought first-half we were outstanding, we played how we want to play.</p>
      <p>"The first half is a reference for how we need to move forward, how we want to play.</p>
      <p>"To come to a place like this, beat the press and play around them was brilliant.</p>
      <p>"They are a good side, we said when they went down to 10-men that that is when it would be hard.</p>
      <p>"It proved to be the case but we dug in. "But look at the second half, we conceded from a set-piece, that is not like us and we have to learn.  </p>
      <p>"We have to learn but that is what is good about this group, we want to learn as much as possible and make sure we put things right."</p>
