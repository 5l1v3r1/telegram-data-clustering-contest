      <h1>Raptors host Sixers in pick’em matchup on Monday NBA odds</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:03:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/author/oddsshark-staff/" target="_blank">OddsShark Staff</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/teams/toronto-raptors/">Toronto Raptors</a> will be looking to remain undefeated on home hardwood this season when they return home on Monday to take on the <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/teams/philadelphia-76ers/">Philadelphia 76ers</a> in a clash of Atlantic Division rivals as a pick’em on the <a href="https://www.oddsshark.com/nba/odds?utm_source=sportsnet.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=editorial">NBA odds</a> at sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com.</p>
      <p>Toronto is coming off a narrow 119-116 win in Atlanta, extending the team’s straight-up win streak to three games going into Monday night’s matchup at Scotiabank Arena.</p>
      <p>The Raptors continued their recent high-scoring ways in Saturday’s victory over the Hawks as 7-point road chalk. The team has put up 121.33 points per game during their current three-game surge, but have produced mixed results at the sportsbooks where they have gone 5-5 against the spread over their past 10 contests, according to the <a href="https://www.oddsshark.com/nba/database?utm_source=sportsnet.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=editorial">OddsShark NBA Database</a>.</p>
      <p>Home court has been far kinder to the Raptors so far in the early going. The Raptors have amassed a perfect 6-0 SU home record, and have claimed victory by an average margin of 14.2 points per game, fueling a steady 5-1 ATS run. Toronto has also scored 124 or more points in four of six home games this year, producing a 5-1 run for the OVER in totals betting.</p>
      <p>The Raptors’ strong play at home has also kept them in the hunt for top spot in the Eastern Conference standings, where they remain deadlocked with Boston and Miami, just 1.5 games back of first-place Milwaukee, and a half-game up on Philadelphia. However, the Raptors have yet to gain momentum on the NBA futures, where they continue to lag behind the favourites at +2000 <a href="https://www.oddsshark.com/nba/odds/futures">odds to win the NBA championship</a>.</p>
      <p>The Sixers make their first trip to Toronto this season riding a four-game SU win streak. The team closed out a three-game homestand with a decisive 113-86 win over the Heat as 5.5-point favourites on Saturday to extend their unblemished SU record at Wells Fargo Center to 7-0. However, the 76ers have struggled badly on the road this season, posting just one win in six outings after opening their away schedule with three straight victories.</p>
      <p>And while the 76ers will be eager to atone for their memorable loss to the Raptors in seven games in the second round of last season’s NBA playoffs, they have a lot of work to do to reverse their dismal regular season record at Scotiabank Arena. Philadelphia has lost SU in 13 straight road dates with the Raptors, losing by double-digit margins in 11 of those contests.</p>
