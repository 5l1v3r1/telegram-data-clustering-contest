      <h1>Gender equality targets to be mandated for Victorian public sector</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author">Wendy Tuohy</a></address>
      <p>Victoria's public sector, which employs hundreds of thousands of people, will have to hit targets on hiring and promoting women under impending new laws, with employers who fail ordered to do so.</p>
      <p>The Gender Equality Bill, to be introduced to Parliament on Tuesday, will require 300 employers, including the public service, councils, universities and TAFEs, Victoria Police, Court Services Victoria and the Office of Public Prosecutions, to show they are "actively pursuing" gender equality.</p>

      <p>The organisations will be required to create gender equality action plans and report equal pay, sexual harassment and equal opportunity career progression. The laws will cover 380,000 employees.</p>
      <p>"Women are often restricted from realising their full potential at work and men are restricted from realising their full potential at home through caring responsibilities coupled with workplace flexibility," said Minister for Women Gabrielle Williams.</p>
      <p>"This bill is designed to support both. Until we start leading by example as a government and a firm decision has been made [to mandate gender quality], we can't fairly expect the private sector to do better."</p>
      <p>A new body will be established to monitor and hold employers accountable. It will measure their performance on gender equality, develop targets and draft redress actions for those that breach the new laws.</p>
      <p>Ms Williams said the legislation was aimed at closing the gender pay gap, removing barriers to progression for women and reducing the risk of "retirement poverty" for women â€“ while boosting opportunities for men to work flexibly. "We know ... gender inequality affects all of us; what we study, the jobs we do, economic security, health and wellbeing and social lives as well. Much of that is driven by systemic barriers in the workplace."</p>
      <p>Emma Bartel, a Geelong police officer and mother of three-year-old twins and a 10-week-old baby, said she had felt the positive impact of the type of changes introduced in the bill.</p>
      <p>Victoria Police introduced anti-discrimination employment policies in the wake of the 2014 Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission review of sexism in the force.</p>
      <p>Before the force's anti-discrimination policies took effect, Senior Sergeant Bartel said she had been looked down upon by some for needing to work in childcare hours, Monday to Friday as a uniformed sergeant.</p>
      <p>But nine months after creating the role of full-time family violence liaison officer for the Geelong region, she was upgraded despite her restricted working hours.</p>
      <p>"I had a year on maternity leave and came back to work as a uniformed sergeant [then as a single parent] and I needed to work childcare hours when traditional police response is 24/7. I was looked down upon by some people, that I was given 'preferential treatment', but I took over the whole role of family violence [liaison] to uplift our response.</p>
      <p>"I was then offered the opportunity of being acting senior sergeant, and I reiterated my working arrangement. But my boss said, 'Tell us what you can do [not what you can't] and from there we can make it fit.' "</p>
      <p>Senior Sergeant Bartel is now a divisional training officer for the western region division one, overseeing 530 members of the force from Geelong to the surf cost, Apollo Bay, Lara, the Bellarine Peninsula and Colac.</p>
      <p>She said removal of "barriers that make it difficult for women to join, get promoted and find satisfaction", and the introduction of flexible work arrangements had helped mothers remain in the force and given more women opportunities for career development.</p>
      <p>"The result is that everyone is helped because you don't just offer it to women with kids but everybody."</p>
