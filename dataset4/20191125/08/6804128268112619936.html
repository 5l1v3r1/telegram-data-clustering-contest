      <h1>Under-fire Manuel Pellegrini retains West Ham backing as Hughton, Wilder and Dyche linked</h1>
      <h2>The Hammers manager oversaw another defeat at the weekend in the Premier League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:35:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:35</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>West Ham are still hopeful manager Manuel Pellegrini will turn the ship around in east London despite the team's alarming slump down the Premier League table since September.</p>
      <p>The Hammers are winless in their last seven league games, losing five of them, and have dropped to 16th in the standings just three points of the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>Saturday's 3-2 defeat to Spurs, and the scoreline in particular, masked another poor performance from the Hammers who were 3-0 down to Jose Mourinho's side before mounting a late rally.</p>
      <p>The Chilean manager is coming under big pressure in east London after two summers of big spending, some questionable tactics and team selections and has shown in inability to to get his players to raise their game.</p>
      <p>Add to that just three Premier League wins all season, the Hammers have completely thrown away their good start to the campaign and are now embroiled in a relegation dog-fight before 2019 is up.</p>
      <p><b>Football.London</b> understands the manager is still not in any immediate danger of losing his job but there is serious concern and alarm at the current results and performances of the team. But they are still behind Pellegrini though improvement is expected sooner rather than later in games against Chelsea and Wolves.</p>

      <p>Names such as Chris Hughton, Rafael Benitez, Eddie Howe, Chris Wilder and Sean Dyche have been linked with the West Ham managerial post in the past 24 hours since the loss to Spurs as the pressure ramps up on Pellegrini.</p>
      <p>The Hammers have games against Chelsea, Wolves and Arsenal in their next three outings where the manager and team is expected to pick up some results.</p>

      <p>Pellegrini was booed midway during the second half on Saturday after replacing Issa Diop with Carlos Sanchez though that could have been down to Diop being suspended for the Chelsea game and Declan Rice saw the rest of the game out at centre back, an indication the manager could be preparing for that scenario for the trip to Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>His decision to stick with calamity keeper Roberto despite the Spaniard making a number of dreadful gaffes since replacing Lukasz Fabianski has drawn wide criticism, as well as the summer recruitment of which Roberto was one of the new faces. Fabianski could return to action in January after a hip injury but pinning hopes on one player returning is a risky startegy.</p>
      <p>Benitez is the 9/4 favourite to take over from Pellegrini according to the bookmakers if he gets the chop, with Hughton at 5/2, Howe 3/1, Dyche 7/2 and Wilder 7/1 to take over.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini still has 18 months remaining on his Â£8m-a-year contract he signed in the summer of 2017 when he replaced David Moyes at the helm in east London so if the club were to sack the Chilean midway through the season then a hefty compensation package will be coming his way.</p>
