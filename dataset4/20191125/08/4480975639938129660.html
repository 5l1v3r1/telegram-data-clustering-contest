      <h3>Key Quotes</h3>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd"><b>GBP/USD</b></a> is showing signs of failure at the psychological resistance at 1.3000 and the recent high at 1.3013. Directly above here we have the 200 week ma at 1.3109, the 50% retracement of the move down from 2018 at 1.3167, the 5 year downtrend at 1.3170 and the 1.3187 May high and this is tough <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> and we look for the market to fail here”.</p>
      <p>“Near term risk is shifting to the downside and attention is on the 1.2768 current November low. Failure at 1.2768 would probably see a slide to the 200 day ma at 1.2703. This guards the 1.2582 September high. Below 1.2582 lies the 1.2493 uptrend line. It guards 1.2196/94”.</p>
