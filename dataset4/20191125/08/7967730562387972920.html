      <p>New Zealand Cricket says it will apologise to Jofra Archer after the England pace bowler said he was the victim of racist insults while batting against the Black Caps on Monday.</p>
      <p>Archer, who was born in Barbados, tweeted on Monday night that one person in the crowd had subjected him to the insults while he attempted to save the test match at Bay Oval in Mt Maunganui.</p>

      <p>Archer batted for 71 minutes, scoring 30 runs off 50 balls before he was dismissed by New Zealand's Neil Wagner as his side went on to lose by an innings and 65 runs.</p>
      <p>New Zealand Cricket later released a statement saying it would be contacting and apologising to Archer. It said he had been racially abused by a spectator as he left the field at the end of play.</p>
      <p>"Although security providers at the venue heard (sic) unable to locate the perpetrator, NZC will be examining CCTV footage and making further inquiries tomorrow in an endeavour to identify the man responsible.</p>
      <p>"NZC has zero tolerance towards abusive or offensive language at any of its venues and will refer any developments in the case to police."</p>
      <p>"It will contact Mr Archer tomorrow to apologise for the unacceptable experience, and to promise increased vigilance in the matter when the teams next meet in Hamilton."</p>
      <p>Ben Stokes tweeted his displeasure at reading Archer's tweet, quoting it and replying with five angry face emojis.</p>

      <p>Monday's allegation follows on from two Australian cricket supporters being thrown out of Manchester's Old Trafford during the Ashes in September for using "foul and abusive" language towards Archer.</p>
      <p>London's <i>Telegraph</i> reported the pair were standing below the England dressing room during day one of the fourth Ashes test shouting sustained abuse at Archer while he was fielding. The insults were in references to Archer's Barbadian heritage.</p>
