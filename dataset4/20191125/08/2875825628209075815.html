      <p>I'm A Celebrity's Ian Wright, 56, is 'fuming' after his personal football memorabilia - including signed shirts, trophies and his 1992 Premier League Golden Boot - is being auctioned off on eBay.</p>
      <p>The former sporting star's accolades were in storage in Orlando, Florida, according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz">The Sun</a> , where the unit was up for grabs at a low price after Wright's ex-wife Deborah stopped paying the monthly fees for the space.</p>
      <p>The shed load of fortune making goods were snapped up by church worker Kurt Wojchiechowski, 24, who is now auctioning off the lot for $150,000.00.</p>

      <p>Kurt, who resides in Wisconsin claims he has offered to sell the sporting gear back to Wright but the price was not right.</p>
      <p>He told the Sun on Sunday: "I gave him multiple opportunities to buy it back already. Now all his stuff is securely locked away and I am waiting for the right moment to sell it. It feels like now is the time.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully Ian will win I'm A Celebrity and I’ll get loads of offers.”</p>
      <p>However, Kurt states on his online advertisement that he is looking for a nearby buyer, as he posted: "Local Pick up only. I could potentially work out a deal to ship it if needed."</p>

      <p>Sport commentator Ian is reportedly 'fuming' at the loss of the items and memories of his sporting success.</p>
      <p>A source told the publication: “Ian’s footballing life was in that storage facility — everything that reminded him of his playing days.</p>
      <p>"He’s fuming that his items could be scattered around the world."</p>

      <p>The contents of the unit were up for purchase after payments were not made on the unit which was then seized by local officials.</p>
      <p>A Florida native brought the unit two years ago and then sold it onto Kurt.</p>
      <p>Under US law if storage space is repossessed the contents belong to the new owner.</p>
