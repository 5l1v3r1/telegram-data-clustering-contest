      <h2>He has put in some impressive performances on loan</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:06:20+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:06</time> by <a rel="author">David Byrom</a></address>
      <p>Cheltenham Town manager Michael Duff says he will discuss Gavin Reilly's future at the club in January.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Bristol Rovers</a> striker moved on loan to Whaddon Road in August, with his loan deal set to expire in the upcoming transfer window.</p>
      <p>Yet he has put in a string of good performances to help Cheltenham to an impressive sixth place in League Two.</p>

      <p>Whilst Duff is expecting younger loanees Jacob Greaves, Max Sheaf and Jake Doyle-Hayes to stay put, he admits it is a different situation for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Rovers</a> striker Reilly.</p>
      <p>"Gav is slightly different because of his age and the fact he is out of contract this summer," Duff said to <a href="https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-midfielder-hull-city-3573138.amp?__twitter_impression=true">Gloucestershire Live.</a></p>
      <p>"He might want something else where he might get offered something longer term and Bristol Rovers might want to call him back.</p>
      <p>"That's probably a longer conversation than the other three younger ones, who are enjoying their football."</p>
      <p>Reilly previously spoke about his future in October, with the 26-year-old admitting <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/loan-cheltenham-town-striker-gavin-3477051">he will see what happens in January.</a></p>
      <p>He said: "I’m just concentrating on doing well here and putting in performances and then see what happens come January.</p>
      <p>"Everyone’s worried about their future, football’s not a long career, you’ve got to try and stay in the game for as long as you can and you’re always looking for that security.</p>
      <p>"I am out of contract next summer so my eyes are turning towards that but you can’t affect what’s going to happen in the future."</p>
