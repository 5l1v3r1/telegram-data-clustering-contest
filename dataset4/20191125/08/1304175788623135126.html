      <h4>When it comes to what to do in Tampa, how do you choose the attractions you want to see? Use this guide to find what's essential.</h4>
      <p>Tampa is the <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/biggest-cities-in-florida.html">third-largest city</a> in Florida. It's an up-and-coming metropolitan area, where many locals are proud to call home and thousands of tourists visit every year. </p>
      <p>There are plenty of events happening all over the city all year 'round, and there really is something for everyone here. If you're planning a visit soon and asking yourself what to do in Tampa, not to worry - just make sure the following five items are on your list!</p>
      <p><b>1. Busch Gardens</b><br/>Busch Gardens is one of the main attractions of Tampa Bay. It's mostly known for its roller coasters and annual events, like Howl-O-Scream and Christmas Town.</p>
      <p>But, there is a wild world waiting to be discovered here! Animal habitats are spread throughout the park for visitors to enjoy. They are home to cheetahs, elephants, kangaroos, otters, and more. The animals are part of Busch Garden's conservation efforts, and their presence definitely puts a special touch on this theme park.</p>
      <p><b>2. The Florida Aquarium</b><br/>Speaking of animals, have you heard of the Florida Aquarium? </p>
      <p>The aquarium is the perfect family-friendly activity or date night destination. It's home to many different kinds of marine life, from stingrays to penguins and sharks. It is located just outside of downtown Tampa, making it easy to work in a visit as part of other plans you may have while in the city - like seeing the Glazer Museum or doing an <a href="https://breakoutgames.com/tampa">escape room</a>. </p>
      <p><b>3. Armature Works</b> <br/>Another must-see site in Tampa is Armature Works. This is the place to be if you want a fun night out, a place to relax on Sunday afternoon, or somewhere to eat where the whole family can get what they'd like. </p>
      <p>Armature Works is a food hall featuring local favorites. It's a great way to try many of the institutions Tampa natives love, without having to drive all over town. Not to mention, the space itself is beautiful inside and out!</p>
      <p><b>4. Ybor City</b><br/>While Armature Works can be a great way to spend an afternoon, Ybor City is also a nice choice. Ybor is the historic area of Tampa. It has a quaint, cozy feel during the day and is actually a popular nightlife destination when the sun goes down. </p>
      <p>Ybor has a little bit of everything. It's home to the elegant Colombia restaurant, laid-back cigar bars and coffee shops, and unique dive bars. It may not sound like all of these things go well together, but in Ybor, they make perfect sense.</p>
      <p><b>5. Enjoy a Florida sunset</b><br/>The final thing to make sure you do while in Tampa is to catch a Florida sunset. There are plenty of prime sunset spots throughout the city to enjoy the view from - you just have to stop and pay attention. </p>
      <p>Whether you're on the Riverwalk, driving down Kennedy Boulevard, or hanging out at Armature Works, don't forget to take in this beautiful sight. If you have the time, drive out to the beach and catch a proper sunset view from the shore. </p>
      <p><b>What to do in Tampa if you're just passing through</b><br/>If you ever find yourself in Tampa for just a few hours, keep these 3 things in mind: coffee, Cuban sandwiches, and craft beer.</p>
      <p>At the heart of this thriving metropolitan city run deep roots. Tampa was started as a small immigrant community, and that history is still evident today. So, it only makes sense to get a feel for Tampa's heritage with a hot cafe con leche or a Cuban. <br/> <br/>But, it's also worth checking out everything Tampa has to offer if you can! From the buzzing craft beer scene to the cool coffee shops and locally-owned restaurants, if you have any doubt about what to do in Tampa, all you have to do is grab a bite (or a pint) to get to know this city.</p>
