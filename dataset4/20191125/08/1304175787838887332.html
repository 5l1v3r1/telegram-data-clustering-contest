      <p>UTRECHT, THE NETHERLANDS - Travel buyers are always working to improve the travel experience for their organizations and employees, but a new study published by the <b>Association of Corporate Travel Executives</b> (ACTE) in collaboration with <b>BCD Travel</b>, “Quality Management in Business Travel 2.0,” finds that the metrics best suited for evaluating the success of the holistic travel experience remain misunderstood and, as a result, crucially underutilized.</p>
      <p>Travel buyers have laid the groundwork for measuring program success, focusing on key financial metrics: Spend and savings continues to be the most popular form of measurement, with 91% of travel buyers using this data to inform their travel programs. Buyers are also consistently keeping track of booking statistics (84%).</p>
      <p>But travel buyers want a more holistic view of their programs. They are aligned on the data they want to use to measure the success of their programs, with 52% saying measuring factors like trip success and traveler friction can help their organization better understand traveler needs, as well as improve services (47%) and policy compliance (37%).</p>
      <p><i>“Unlike traditional, financial measurements, these types of metrics pose a unique challenge for travel buyers – they are inherently subjective to the traveler, and there isn’t a single, industry-wide definition for them, which is making it very tricky to measure,” </i>said <b>Miriam Moscovici</b>, senior director, Research &amp; Innovation at BCD Travel.</p>
      <p><i>“This study creates a unique opportunity for the industry to come together and transform the way we measure the quality of travel programs,”</i> said <b>Leigh Bochicchio</b>, executive director, ACTE. “<i>Creating a well-framed rubric for gathering objective and subjective data will provide a more balanced view of the value and success of a corporate travel program – and the corporate travel manager.”</i></p>
      <p><b>Barriers to change persist</b><br/>Travel buyers suggest a lack of reliable data is a key obstacle to better quality measurement in business travel.</p>
      <p>Almost two-thirds (62%) of respondents find that many important metrics are difficult to measure accurately: Available data can be fragmented (29%) and unreliable (21%). As a result, buyers are left having to draw conclusions from incomplete data sets, creating a greater margin of error when making changes to the travel program.</p>
      <p>However, when it comes to more nebulous – albeit, possibly better – measurements like trip success, travel buyers currently rely on self-reported traveler feedback. Unfortunately, respondents find this method of data collection particularly unreliable, with 40% saying it can be misleading, and 33% saying they tend to receive a low response rate to requests for traveler feedback.<br/> <br/>Overall, this study has found that travel managers are deeply committed to improving their travel programs, and generally agree on where they want to go – but they still need help on how to get there. The key to overcoming barriers to change, then, is collaboration and consensus-building – something this study has already advanced.</p>
