      <h3>Key Quotes</h3>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/usdchf"><b>USD/CHF</b></a> is heading back up to the .9984/96 mid-September and midOctober highs. While it remains below theslightly higher 1.0014/28 midJune and October peaks on a daily <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart">chart</a> closing basis, we will continue to target the .9844/41 September and October lows. Failure at the next lower .9799 September low would push key support at .9716/.9659 to the fore. This is the location of the January, June, mid- and late August lows. Below here sits the .9659 August low and the September 2018 low at .9543”.</p>
