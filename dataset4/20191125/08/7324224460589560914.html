      <p>Luka Doncic was the standout performer for the Mavericks with 41 points and 10 assists, becoming only the third active player to register at least 30 points and 10 assists in four consecutive outings – James Harden and Russell Westbrook being the others. He had already become the youngest in NBA history to do so in three on the bounce.</p>
