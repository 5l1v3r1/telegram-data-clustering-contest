      <p>Jackie-Louise Armstrong seemed to have lost her grip during an aerial act at the show and fell. The circus staff quickly rushed to help the artist.</p>
      <p>After ambulance arrived she was taken to hospital.</p>
      <blockquote>"It was horrific. I thought it was part of the act but when she didn’t get back up I knew something was wrong. A group of people ran on to help her and people were shouting for a paramedic," eyewitness said, as quoted by the KentOnline.</blockquote>
      <p>“She was yelping in agony, it was traumatic as she bounced as she hit the floor. There was an announcement after a min or two to all leave,” another eyewitness said.</p>
      <p>According to the circus director Martin Burton she was a very experienced artist.</p>
      <p>“At this stage we cannot comment further as we have no information on any injuries she may have sustained,” he said.</p>
      <p>Soon after the accident, spectators were asked to leave and were offered tickets for the next performance.</p>
