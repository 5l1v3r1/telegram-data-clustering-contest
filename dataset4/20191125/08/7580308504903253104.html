      <h1>Watch: M.anifest Teams Up With Burna Boy On New Single “Tomorrow”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:53:36+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:53</time> by <a rel="author">Violet Johnson</a></address>
      <p>In celebration of his 37th birthday, multi-award-winning Ghanaian rapper, Kwame Ametepee Tsikata better known as M.anifest has released a new single titled “Tomorrow” featuring Grammy Award-nominated artist, Burna Boy off his forthcoming EP “The Gamble”.</p>
      <p><i>I go love you like say tomorrow no dey, </i>Burna Boy sings. This looks like a song that will not just grow on you but become a new love anthem.</p>
      <p>As heard, ‘Tomorrow’, which was produced by Drvmroll, is an urgent expression of love over a seamless blend of hip-hop and Afrobeats. Burna Boy comes through with an earworm of a hook in pidgin English which loosely translates as “Tomorrow isn’t promised for any of us, so today I will love you like tomorrow will never exist.”</p>
      <p>The video, which opens at a beach resort, seamlessly blends the elements of nature with vintage touches in their attires and props. The visual sees both Burna and M.anifest in their lover boy mode as they attempt to reassure their love interests of unconditional love at every opportunity.</p>
      <p>Watch <i>Tomorrow</i> below:</p>

      <p>M.anifest’s lyrical gifts and wordplay compliment a smooth baritone delivery and we see him at his most vulnerable in his expression of love and affection towards an amour.</p>
      <p>This is the second time this year that M.anifest and Burna Boy are teaming up on unique singles, the first being on Burna’s “Another Story”.</p>
