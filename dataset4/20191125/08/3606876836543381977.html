      <p>Tension has gripped the small town of Kithaku in Meru county after a man was violently gang-raped by suspected gay criminals who have been terrorizing residents in the area.</p>
      <p>The man, a tea picker working at a nearby farm, had left the bar on Sunday night when the gang pounced on him.</p>

      <p><i>“We have been having cases of insecurity in the last few months lost over 10 cows sheep, over 100 sheep and many kitchen</i>.</p>
      <p>“<i>We are now very alarmed because the young criminals have now metamorphosed and started raping and sodomizing old men. The recent case was that of a tea picker who was having a drink here and was accosted by the suspected criminals</i>,” Cliff Kikunda.</p>
      <p>The victim was discovered with a bottle stuffed in his back side, much to the anger of the residents.</p>
      <p>Locals called on the government to take swift action failure to which they would take the law unto their hands and confront the barbaric gang.</p>
      <p>The town borders Mt Kenya forest which has served as a strategic hiding area for the criminals who hide their loot in the forest before transporting them to other towns.</p>
      <p>“<i>The government should immediately bring security officers in the area and possibly build a police station. Things are very bad here</i>,” another resident complained.</p>
