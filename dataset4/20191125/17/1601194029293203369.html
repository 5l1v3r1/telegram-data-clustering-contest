      <p>Since appearing on WWE programming for the first time in October, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> has made no secret of his desire to face <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/brock-lesnar">Brock Lesnar</a> one day.</p>
      <p>The heavyweight boxer told <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/tyson-fury-teases-dream-match-with-wwe-champion-brock-lesnar-exclusive">Sportskeeda’s Gary Cassidy</a> ahead of his battle against Braun Strowman at Crown Jewel that he has no plans to compete in another WWE match until after he has fought Deontay Wilder in February 2020, but “The Beast” would be his preferred opponent if he returns to the squared circle.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the True Geordie podcast, Fury followed up his comments about Lesnar by claiming he has the ability to defeat the WWE Champion in just 30 seconds, regardless of whether they meet in a WWE ring or a UFC octagon.</p>
      <blockquote>“I watched a few of his [UFC] fights, for sure. Pretty handy but I could flatten him in seconds. In a WWE match or in a proper fight, I could flatten Brock Lesnar in thirty seconds.”</blockquote>
      <p>You can watch the Lesnar conversation from the 30:00 mark of the video below.</p>

      <h4>What’s next for Brock Lesnar?</h4>
      <p>While Tyson Fury prepares to face Deontay Wilder, it is unclear what lies ahead for Brock Lesnar following his victory over Rey Mysterio in a No Holds Barred match at Survivor Series.</p>
      <p>The WWE Champion is being advertised for the episode of RAW after Survivor Series, so it might not be long before his next WWE opponent is revealed.</p>
