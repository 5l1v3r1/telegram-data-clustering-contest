      <h1>Cheltenham Festival pointers we learned from the weekend's horse racing action</h1>
      <h2>There was plenty of quality action on Saturday and Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:28:56+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/eamon-doggett/" target="_blank">Eamon Doggett</a></address>
      <p>There was a fantastic weekend of racing that was headlined by Altior losing his unbeaten record in a thrilling battle with Cyrname.</p>
      <p>In what could be another changing of the guard Lostintranslation also dethroned Betfair Chase king Bristol De Mai at Haydock.</p>
      <p>And Chris's Dream could not have been more impressive in winning the Troytown Chase at Navan on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Here is what we learned with a view to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/cheltenham-festival">the Cheltenham Festival</a> in March:</p>
      <h3>Altior's Gold Cup dreams seem to be over</h3>

      <p>What to do with Altior now? That's the question trainer <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/nicky-henderson">Nicky Henderson</a> will have to answer after his star horse was beaten for the first time over jumps to Cyrname at Ascot on Saturday.</p>
      <p>It was an experiment that if it went right would have naturally led to Altior rocking up in the King George and then potentially having a tilt at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/cheltenham-gold-cup">the Cheltenham Gold Cup.</a></p>
      <p>Henderson has not ruled out still having a go at the King George but a return to two miles looks more likely.</p>
      <p>It means we could be looking at the tantalising prospect of Altior, Defi Du Seuil and Chacun Pour Soi all lining up in the Champion Chase come March - what a race that could be!</p>
      <h3>Lostintranslation is the real deal</h3>

      <p>We have a new ante-post favourite for the Gold Cup and his name is Lostintranslation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/colin-tizzard">Colin Tizzard</a> knows a thing or two about training a horse for the big race having guided Native River to glory in 2018.</p>
      <p>And he has never hidden his love for Lostintranslation who was most impressive in seeing off Haydock specialist Bristol De Mai on Saturday.</p>
      <p>That is top-class form and his novice chase form exploits that are closely linked with Defi Du Seuil look better and better.</p>
      <p>We have yet to see reigning champion Al Boum Photo in action this season but we may have already seen the champion in waiting.</p>
      <h3>Minella Indo looks value for RSA Chase</h3>

      <p>Laurina took all the headlines after getting his chasing career off to an ideal start at Gowran Park.</p>
      <p>But trainer Henry De Bromhead was delighted with the efforts of Minella Indo who chased the mare home with the pair well clear of the rest.</p>
      <p>Look back on last year's Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle and it is remarkable how well Minella Indo saw out the three miles having been so keen throughout.</p>
      <p>Once this horse steps up to three miles over fences, there will be few horses able to live with his gallop and 10/1 looks good value for the RSA Chase.</p>
