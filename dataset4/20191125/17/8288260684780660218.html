      <p>Bargain hunters are in for a treat as Morrisons is about to start selling boxes brimming with food past its ‘best before’ date ‘best before’ date for less than £4.</p>
      <p>Shoppers can use the Too Good to Go app to purchase unsold fruit and veg, bakery and deli items - worth at least £10 - for a purse-friendly£3.09. </p>
      <p>But there's a catch - the contents of the boxes will only be revealed when they are picked up from the supermarket.</p>
      <p>The supermarket giant has already trialled the service in a handful of stores but it will be available in all 494 Morrisons supermarkets nationwide from tomorrow (Tuesday, November 26).</p>

      <p>All people need to do is download the free Too Good to Go app and browse local stores with food available. Payment is made through the app and food will be able to from the selected store during a given collection window.</p>
      <p>Morrisons - which has stores in Aldridge, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/bilston">Bilston</a> , Edgbaston, Kingswinford, Pendeford,Willenhall and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wednesbury">Wednesbury</a> - expects to distribute 350,000 boxes of unsold food in 2020. In addition to helping customers on a tight budget, it also aims to assist Morrisons in its pledge to reduce operational food waste by 50 per cent by 2030.</p>
      <p>Jayne Wall, Market Street director at Morrisons, said: “We are using technology to help us reduce food waste and to help more people afford to eat well. It will also mean we waste less food this Christmas as it will find a home for products that can’t be sold after the festive period.” </p>
      <p>Hayley Conick, UK Country Manager at Too Good To Go, added: “Every single day perfectly edible food goes to waste simply because it isn’t sold, and this is having detrimental effects on our planet. In fact, food waste contributes to eight per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <p>"We need greater awareness of the issue of food waste, so we are delighted to welcome Morrisons as our first UK supermarket partner. Together we can fight food waste and ensure that quality surplus produce doesn’t end up in the bin.”</p>
