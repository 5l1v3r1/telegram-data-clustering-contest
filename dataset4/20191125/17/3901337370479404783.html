      <p>After their inspiring performance against Kaizer Chiefs in the Telkom Knockout, Eric Tinkler has praised his team for the way they nullified the Glamour Boys in their march to the final. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Tinkler has overseen a remarkable turnaround in the club’s fortunes after a desperate 2018/19 campaign that saw them almost relegated from the Absa Premiership, but now they find themselves on their longest unbeaten run in almost a decade and into the final of the TKO.</p>
      <p>The former Bafana Bafana international, who has lost just eight of his 29 games in charge at Maritzburg, was delighted with his defensive line in the absence of both Kwanda Mngonyama and Siyanda Xulu, with Pogiso Sanoka, Rushine de Reuck and Nazeer Allie all putting in a fine performance against the league leaders. </p>
      <p>As quoted by the club’s official website, Tinkler said, “We knew they would be going to be coming with Castro and Nurkovic, they’re a team that likes to play off the second ball. We dealt with that well with Pogiso, and then looking for the cover, I thought Rushine and Nazeer Allie, defensively were superb.</p>
      <p>“Especially Rushine in that first half because there was a lot of those balls coming in and he was dealing with the first header, winning the second tackle. So we dealt with that pressure very well… But then on the transition there was so much space to exploit, but that’s why I was a little upset, we didn’t exploit that space enough.” </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, he also reserved special praise for the two-goal hero, Moseamedi, who worked to ‘exploit’ Chiefs’ new-look defence, adding, “Judah was absolutely fantastic. On the break, his pace, we knew it was a new central defensive pairing, we needed to exploit that, and it worked for us.”</p>

      <p>Maritzburg now turn their attentions to Wednesday night’s game against SuperSport United as they look to extend their unbeaten run even further.  </p>
