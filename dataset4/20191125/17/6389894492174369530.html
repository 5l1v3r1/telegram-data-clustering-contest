      <p>Consolidated viewing figures, which include catch-up and online views over the last week as well as live viewing, revealed an average audience of more than 13m, the broadcaster announced.</p>
      <p>The figures represent roughly half a million more viewers than for a May episode of BBC drama Line of Duty, which previously stood at the top of the 2019 ratings chart.</p>
      <p>The popular celebrity survival show, which is fronted by Ant and Dec, also secured the highest viewing figures of the year for 16 to 24-year-olds, averaging 3.5m TV viewers with a 71 per cent share of viewing for that demographic.</p>
      <p>It comes as a welcome boost for the public service broadcaster, which is battling a decline in traditional TV viewing and faltering advertising revenue.</p>
      <p>ITV has enjoyed an uptick in viewing from set-piece hits such as Love Island and the Rugby World Cup, and the company is increasingly shifting focus towards its online catch-up service ITV Hub.</p>

      <p>However, figures published earlier this month revealed the broadcaster had suffered a six per cent decline in total viewing hours in the third quarter.</p>
