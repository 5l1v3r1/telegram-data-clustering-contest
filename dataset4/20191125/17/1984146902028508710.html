      <h1>Sunderland announce new date for Fleetwood Town fixture at the Stadium of Light</h1>
      <h2>Sunderland's game against Fleetwood Town, which was postponed due to international call-ups, has been rescheduled for late February</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:15:29+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author">James Hunter</a></address>
      <p>Sunderland's home game against Joey Barton's Fleetwood Town - which was postponed last month - will be played at the end of February.</p>
      <p>The game was originally due to be played at the Stadium of Light on Saturday, October 12, but the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Black Cats</a> asked the EFL to postpone the fixture after Jon McLaughlin, Conor McLaughin, and Tom Flanagan, were called up for international duty.</p>
      <p>And the game has now been rearranged for Tuesday, February 25, with kick-off at 7.45pm.</p>
      <p>Tickets purchased for the original fixture against the Cod Army remain valid.</p>
      <p>The new date falls between Sunderland's home game against Bristol Rovers on Saturday, February 22, and the trip to Birmingham City's St Andrew's home to face Coventry City on February 29.</p>
      <p>Sunderland have asked for all three of their League One games this season which have fallen within the international breaks to be rescheduled.</p>
      <p>Their home game against Nigel Clough's Burton Albion, which was due to be played in September, takes place tomorrow, and the new date for the Fleetwood game has also now been confirmed.</p>
      <p>They also postponed this month's trip to the Memorial Stadium to face Bristol Rovers, but as yet there has been no new date announced for that fixture.</p>
