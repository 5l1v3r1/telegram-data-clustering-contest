      <p>Facebook Ireland made a profit before tax of €361.3m in 2018 on revenues of €25.5bn.</p>
      <p>The social network said accounts that it has lodged with the Companies Registration Office will show its pre-tax profits rose by 43% in 2018, up from €251.8m a year earlier.</p>
      <p>The company paid €63.2m in tax on that profit, up 65% on the previous year.</p>
      <p>That means the firm paid an effective tax rate of 17.5% for the period.</p>
      <p>Revenue rose by more than a third to €25.5bn, compared to a year earlier.</p>
      <p>The company claims it contributed €961 million directly to the Irish economy in capital investment, suppliers and employee-related expenses.</p>
      <p>A year ago, the company revealed that it was expanding its presence in Ireland, by acquiring a long-term lease of 14 acres for a new campus development at Bank Centre in Ballsbridge in Dublin. </p>
      <p>The development will substantially increase its floorspace in the city, enabling it to expand its workforce by up to 5,000.</p>
      <p>All 2,000 employees based at its current European Headquarters in Grand Canal Square in Dublin will have moved to the new campus by 2022.</p>
