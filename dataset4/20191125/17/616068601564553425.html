      <p>The Social Planning Council brought forward their Vernon homelessness study to council this afternoon, which included the annual homeless count.</p>
      <p>According to the study they counted 151 homeless individuals, which is down from last years count of 161. But, the study did not include the people who moved into the 54-unit My Place apartment complex this year.</p>
      <p>The study showed that Vernon's count falls in the middle in the Okanagan. In 2018, the ratio of homeless people to the whole population of Vernon was 4/1,000. Kelowna came in at 5/1,000, and Penticton at 3/1,000.</p>
      <p>Comparing the number of people sleeping outside from 2018 to 2019 was almost halved, with the study showing 22 currently sleeping outside.</p>
      <p>"When we have the capacity to shelter the homeless, people come in," said Annette Sharkey of the Social Planning Council. "I get very nervous when i hear the words 'lifestyle choice' because I feel that people don't choose to sleep outside when they have the option to seek shelter."</p>
      <p>The study outlined many of the factors that lead to homelessness in the area, including rising house market costs, addiction and mental health.</p>
