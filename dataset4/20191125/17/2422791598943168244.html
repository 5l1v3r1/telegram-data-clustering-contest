      <h1>Canada-wide emergency alert system to be tested Wednesday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:18:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:18</time> by <a rel="author">Graham Slaughter, CTVNews.ca Writer</a></address>
      <p>TORONTO -- If your cellphone receives an emergency alert text on Wednesday, don’t panic.</p>
      <p>Canada’s national emergency alert system, Alert Ready, has scheduled a public test for later this week. Depending on where you live, the test will be sent in the late morning or early afternoon.</p>
      <p>Test messages will be sent via compatible wireless devices, television and radio.</p>
      <p>"Test alerts educate Canadians on what an emergency alert will look and sound like in the event of a life-threatening situation,” Martin Belanger, director of public alerting at Pelmorex, which operates Alert Ready’s technical infrastructure, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The tests haven’t always gone according to plan. Only 60 per cent of wireless users in Manitoba received an alert during the system’s first test in May 2018.</p>
      <p>Similar issues arose across Canada during the second test in November 2018, which was considered “a significant improvement” from the first test but still not perfect.</p>
      <p>The alert system is designed to send out rapid messages in the event of an imminent threat to public safety.</p>
      <p>All phones sold in Canada since April 6, 2019 should be wireless public alerting compatible.</p>
      <p>Here is when to expect a message, based on where you live:</p>
