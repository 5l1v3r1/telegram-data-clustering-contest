      <p>A MAYO woman won a cool €29,000 on the National Lottery TV game show Winning Streak last Saturday, 24 years after her mother appeared on the RTÉ One programme.</p>
      <p>Emer O’Grady from Westport was delighted with her Winning Streak haul and spoke of how she learned her ticket was pulled from the drum the week before.</p>
      <p>Emer had just left her mother’s house and was driving home when she got a call from her mum, Anne, who was very excited and said her name was pulled out of the drum. Emer thought it was a practical joke and initially didn’t believe her mum, until a glut of calls came in from other friends and family congratulating her.</p>
      <p>Emer’s Winning Streak luck is something she credits her mum with as Anne was the one who told her to sign the back of a scratch card the week before.</p>
      <p>Anne has the magic Winning Streak touch as she appeared on the show way back in February 1995, then presented by Mike Murphy, and won £6,000. Emer was in the audience that day cheering her mum on and last weekend, almost 25 years later, the roles were reversed.</p>
      <p>Emer works as a pharmacy validation engineer in Allergan.</p>
      <p>With her winnings she says that she will treat her parents to something nice.</p>
      <p>And, she admits, she has never been to a Mayo GAA game so says she will put her winnings to good use and get a ticket for the next Mayo match.</p>
      <p>The lucky ticket was sold at Laura’s XL, Hopkins Road, Castlebar.</p>
