      <p>A man who attempted to attack staff members at a busy supermarket in Dundalk and threatened to burn the store down has been arrested by Gardaí.  </p>
      <p>An eye witness told the Democrat that the guards had to ''hold the man down'' after he came into the Aldi store on the Ramparts Road brandishing a pole just after 4pm.  </p>
      <p>The eye witness also said that an elderly woman who was shopping in Aldi at the time told the man to ''stop wrecking the place'' and that the guards were going to ''lock him up''. </p>
      <p>According to the source, the man was taken away by Gardaí and no injuries were reported. </p>
      <p>A garda spokesperson said: ''At approximately 4.20pm on the 25/11/2019  a man in his 20s was arrested for alleged breaches of the Public Order Act, following reports of a disturbance outside a retail unit on Rampart Road, Dundalk.</p>
      <p>''He was taken to Dundalk Garda Station and is expected to appear before a sitting of Dundalk District Court next month charged in connection with the case.''</p>
