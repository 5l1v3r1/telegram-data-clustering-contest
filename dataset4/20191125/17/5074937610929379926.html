      <h1>Don’t link road crashes to witchcraft - MCE </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:10:17+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:10</time> by <a rel="author">Dennis Peprah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Sunyani, Nov. 25, GNA – The uncontrolled crashes and fatalities that occur nationwide during Christmas seasons must not be linked to witchcraft, Mr. Martin Obeng, the Sunyani West Municipal Chief Executive has said.</p>
      <p>Rather, most of the road accidents happened as a result of driver errors, and that the weather condition had always not been favourable for driving during dry seasons.</p>
      <p>Mr. Obeng said indicators showed that this year’s Harmattan (dry, dusty season) would be severe and cautioned drivers to reduce speed during their journeys to control road crashes during this year’s Christmas season.</p>
      <p>The MCE was speaking at the launch of the 2019 road safety campaign by the National Road Safety Authority (NRSA) held at the weekend in Sunyani.</p>
      <p>The Bono, Bono East and Ahafo Regional Office of the NRSA has outlined series of outreach programmes aimed at sensitizing drivers, passengers and pedestrians on road safety tips to help minimize accidents on some major highways in the three regions.</p>
      <p>Mr. Obeng said driver negligence and indiscipline on the highways were always high during the Christmas season, and called on the Police to increase their visibility and intensify night patrols as well.</p>
      <p>He called on the Ghana Highways Authority, Departments of Urban and Feeder Roads to repair potholes on the roads and highways, re-mark faded and blurred road markings and also improve on road signs to enhance visibility of drivers.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kwasi Agyenim Boateng, the Bono, Bono East and Ahafo Regional Head of the NRSA said concerted and broader efforts were required from all stakeholders to control crashes in the upcoming Christmas festivities.</p>
      <p>He said the commission in collaboration with the Police MTTD and the Driver Vehicle and Licensing Authority are intensifying enforcement efforts and advised drivers to ensure regular maintenance of their vehicles, check brakes, tyres and lighting systems before embarking on any journey.</p>
      <p>Mr. Boateng urged passengers too to check drivers against alcoholism and careless driving to stem road accidents.</p>
