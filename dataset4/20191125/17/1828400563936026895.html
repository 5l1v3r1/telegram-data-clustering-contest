      <h2>A small community banded together to buy a special heart-shaped gravestone for a little girl who loved princesses, unicorns and the colour pink.</h2>

      <p>Dozens of people gathered at the Old Bank Restaurant on Lord Street, Fleetwood, in memory of Lana Driver, who died on October 25 at just five-years-old.</p>

      <p>The Red Marsh pupil was born with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which occurs when the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen fails to properly develop, and suffered from pulmonary hypertension, a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in the lungs.</p>
      <p>Her funeral took place on November 8 at St Nicholas’ Church.</p>
      <p>Her mum Susie Driver, 36, hoped to pay further tribute to the ‘warrior princess’ with a special gravestone.</p>
      <p>Some of Lana’s favourite songs were played at the Old Bank on Saturday, and prizes including gift hampers, booze, and signed football shirts were raffled off.</p>

      <p>On the day, well-wishers raised £1,728 - with even more money due to come in later.</p>
      <p>Susie said: “It was amazing. I wanted to raise £1,000 and we smashed it.</p>
      <p>“This means we’ll be able to give Lana a beautiful final resting place, where I can sit with her and talk to her.”</p>
      <p>After buying Lana’s heart-shaped gravestone, the leftover cash will be donated to Brian House Children’s Hospice and the Ronald McDonald House, which provides free accommodation to families while their child is in hospital.</p>
