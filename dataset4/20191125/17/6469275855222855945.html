        <b>Alex Neil has revealed that Andrew Hughes’ latest absence from the Preston team has been because of a fractured bone in his foot.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The left-back has sat out the last three games since he was hurt early on in the 3-2 derby victory over Blackburn on October 26.</p>
      <p>PNE manager Neil had kept the injury under wraps but spoke about it in the build-up to Wednesday night’s visit to Hull City.</p>
      <p>Hughes is well down the road to recovery from the break but is still regarded as ‘touch and go’ for the KCOM Stadium clash.</p>
      <p>The damaged foot is the latest injury Hughes has had this season, with a damaged hamstring and strained hip flexor having previously kept him sidelined.</p>
      <p>The Welshman played as a centre-half against Rovers due to Ben Davies being out.</p>
      <p>He suffered the fracture early on but completed the game before the extent of the damage was confirmed.</p>
      <p>Neil said: “What happened was that Hughesy kicked the bottom of the boot of one of the Blackburn lads and he fractured the top of his foot.</p>
      <p>“It was a contact injury, there was nothing you can do about it. It is not a soft tissue injury or muscle damage, it is just a case of the bone healing.</p>
      <p>“For the next game he is touch and go but he’s not that far away at all.</p>
      <p>“Hughesy has been on the grass running and can do a lot of stuff.</p>
      <p>“Just hitting the ball longer distances is what is holding him back at the moment.</p>
      <p>“That is where he was at before the weekend so it shouldn’t be too long before it settles down.”</p>
      <p>Hughes got the injury soon after PNE had fallen 2-0 behind to Rovers inside 11 minutes.</p>
      <p>They hit back to score three goals in the second half to claim victory.</p>
      <p>Neil said: “It was early in the game and with how we were playing Hughesy was under pressure to stay on the pitch.</p>
      <p>“He didn’t know he had fractured it at the time to be fair to him.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes with an injury like that you can withstand it for the rest of the game and then it becomes an issue.”</p>
      <p>Hughes, 27, has been limited to five appearances this campaign.</p>
      <p>He tore a hamstring in the second game of the season against Wigan, returning in the 1-0 win at Birmingham on September 21.</p>
      <p>In that game he got a kick on his hip flexor which kept him out until the Blackburn match.</p>
