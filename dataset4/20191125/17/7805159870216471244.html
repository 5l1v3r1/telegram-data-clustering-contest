      <h1>How to get the Pixel Launcher with overview text and image selection on any rooted Android 10 device</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:09:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/joefedewa/" target="_blank">Joe Fedewa</a></address>
      <p>When Google switched up the Overview screen in Android P, they introduced a new feature called “<a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-p-beta-3-google-pixel-2-xl/">Smart Selection</a>.” Basically, switching the Pixel Launcher Overview to horizontal scrolling cards with high-resolution previews allowed OCR (optical character recognition) to work on them. You can literally select text and images from what is essentially a screenshot of the last state of the app. Unfortunately, Google <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-p-smart-selection-app-actions-limited-google-pixel-2/">limited this feature</a> to the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-2">Pixel 2</a> and newer Pixel devices.</p>
      <p>Of course, these limitations are easily broken if you’re willing to do a little modding. You can get text and image selection working on the Pixel Launcher Overview screen on any rooted Android 10 device with the QuickSwitch <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk">Magisk</a> Module and a few other tricks. Thanks to XDA Senior Member <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=9101454">remewer</a>, if you already have a rooted ARM64 Android 10 device with Magisk (20.1+), the setup process is pretty simple.</p>
