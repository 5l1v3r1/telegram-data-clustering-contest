      <h1>Report: Galatasaray planned to sell Villa Luyindama, injury may have scuppered move</h1>

      <p>Galatasaray were reportedly planning on selling defender Christian Luyindama to Aston Villa in January – but a season-ending injury appears to have scuppered the move.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sabah.com.tr/spor/futbol/2019/11/24/14-milyon-euroluk-darbe">According to Sabah</a>, officials had been in contact with Villa to organise a transfer, which would give them the funds to go about acquiring new players.</p>

      <p>It is thought the deal would have landed them around €14 million/£12 million.</p>
      <p>Luyindama sustained a knee injury whilst on international duty with DR Congo, and he is now set to have surgery on a torn cruciate ligament (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50530733">BBC Sport</a>).</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old is expected to be out for the rest of the season.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Blows for everyone</h3>
      <p>The nature of Luyindama’s injury is a hugely unfortunate situation.</p>

      <p>Firstly the player himself will be out for a considerable period, and then Gala appear to be losing out in terms of what his sale could have done for strengthening the squad.</p>
      <p>Villa will very likely have to look elsewhere now for another central defender, which is a shame considering the headway they had seemingly made over the former Standard Liege man.</p>
      <p>Villa do have Ezri Konsa and Kortney Hause in reserve, but Luyindama is a colossus and could have further strengthened Dean Smith’s squad.</p>
