Lauren and Gleb will dance their foxtrot again to “Jolene” by<b> Dolly Parton</b>. Kel and Witney will repeat their jazz to “We’re All In This Together” by the <i>High School Musical</i> cast.

      <p><b>Cher</b> will perform her classic “The Beat Goes On” during the finale, while <b>Pitbull</b> and<b> NE-YO</b> will perform “3 to Tango” and “Me Quedaré Contigo.” As if the finale couldn’t get more jam-packed, the first look at<i> The Bachelor</i> season 24 will be revealed. The winner of the <i>American Idol</i> fan vote will be revealed live as well. Eliminated celebrities from season 28 will also return to the dance floor to perform once again.</p>
