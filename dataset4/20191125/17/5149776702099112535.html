      <h1>Former Nottingham Forest striker enjoying new lease of life following City Ground exit</h1>
      <h2>Latest Nottingham Forest news | The 36-year-old left the Reds in the summer and went on to sign for League One side Bolton Wanderers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Former Nottingham Forest striker Daryl Murphy is enjoying a new lease of life since his departure from <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-transfer-news-live-3573959">the City Ground</a>.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old left the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Reds </a>by mutual consent on transfer deadline day in September, and went on to sign for League One club Bolton Wanderers.</p>
      <p>Prior to his Forest exit, the Republic of Ireland international scored 13 goals in 60 appearances for the Reds after his move to Trentside in 2017.</p>
      <p>Murphy did not make a single first-team appearance for the Reds under <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-qpr-bristol-city-3576177">manager Sabri Lamouchi</a>, with his last outing coming against current club Bolton on the final day of last season.</p>
      <p>Now at Bolton, the experienced striker has been in a rich vein of form for the Trotters in recent matches.</p>
      <p>Murphy opened his account for Bolton in their 2-0 win over Bristol Rovers in October, and followed that up with what proved to be a winning goal in a 2-1 victory over Fleetwood Town earlier this month.</p>

      <p>And in more recent matches, Murphy has bagged goals in back-to-back games against MK Dons and Accrington Stanley to take his tally up for four this season.</p>
      <p>Those four goals have come in four consecutive appearances for Murphy, and the former Forest man looks to be flourishing away from the City Ground.</p>
