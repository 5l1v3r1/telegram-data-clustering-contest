      <h1>Liverpool handed boost ahead of Champions League clash with Napoli</h1>
      <h2>Napoli must do without the services of Italian star Lorenzo Insigne for the penultimate Champions League group stage clash at Anfield</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:14:38+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:14</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Napoli star Lorenzo Insigne has been ruled out of their Champions League clash with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp's side welcome Napoli to Anfield on Wednesday night in their penultimate Group H clash.</p>
      <p>Insigne, 28, played over an hour in the 1-1 draw with AC Milan this weekend before picking up an elbow injury.</p>
      <p>And the Serie A side have confirmed he will play no part in the clash at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Napoli have been able to include Fabian Ruiz and Faouzi Ghoulam in their squad for the encounter, despite both missing training on Monday.</p>

      <p>Liverpool sit top of the group going into the clash, one point ahead of Napoli, despite losing in Italy earlier this season.</p>
      <p>Napoli boss Carlo Ancelotti makes his return to England, amid recent speculation linking him with the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> job.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> chief was reportedly a contender to replace Mauricio Pochettino, before Jose Mourinho was appointed.</p>
      <p>But Spurs accepted they could not afford the Italian, who also finds himself under pressure.</p>

      <p>Napoli sit seventh in Serie A and have managed just five wins from their first 13 encounters.</p>
      <p>Saturday's draw with Milan made it six matches without a win in all competitions for the Serie A side.</p>
      <p>Dries Mertens and Hirving Lozano are expected to fill the void left by the injured Insigne, while Fernando Llorente is another option.</p>
