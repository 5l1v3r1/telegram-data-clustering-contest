So as a special <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/black-friday-2019-start-date-20395035">Black Friday</a> freebie, BT has decided to hand out six months worth of free <a href="https://amzn.to/2KSflRk">Amazon Prime Video,</a> worth £36.</p>
      <p>Available to all new customers to <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=3041&amp;clickref=mirror20958523&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bt.com%252Ftv%252Fpackages%252F%5D%5D">BT TV</a> as well as those upgrading their existing package, prices start <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=3041&amp;clickref=mirror20958523&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bt.com%252Ftv%252Fpackages%252F%5D%5D">at £34.99</a> for a TV and broadband subscription with free Amazon Prime.</p>
