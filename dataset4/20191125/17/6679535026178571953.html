      <p>After being shut for more than half a decade, Nokia’s Chennai plant is likely to resume operations by March 2020. Union Telecom and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday announced that the plant had been bought by Finland-based Salcomp — the world’s largest maker of mobile phone chargers and a key supplier for Apple.</p>
      <p>“Salcomp has reached an agreement to take over that facility... It is expected to start operations by March 2020. Salcomp will be investing ₹2,000 crore over the next five years. It will bring direct employment to 10,000 people and indirect employment to 50,000 people,” the Minister said.</p>
      <p>The factory has been shut since 2014 following a tax dispute.</p>
      <p>The Minister added that Salcomp will be exporting 70% of the products made in India, mostly to China.</p>
      <p>Further, Mr. Prasad added that Apple had started the production of its iPhone XR in India for the domestic market and exports. “India will have the most favourable regime to become a big centre for mobile manufacturing,” he said. Exports of electronics from India were expected to double to $3.2 billion in the current financial year (2019-20).</p>
