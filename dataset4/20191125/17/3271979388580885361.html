      <p><b>Prince Harry</b> and <b>Meghan Markle</b> will not be spending Christmas with <b>George Clooney </b>and<b> Amal Clooney</b> at Lake Como this year. The bogus premise can be found in one of the tabloids. <b>Gossip Cop</b> looked into the story and we can debunk it.</p>
      <p>A report in <i><b>NW</b></i> this week claims the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be spending the holidays in Italy with the Clooneys instead of spending it with Queen Elizabeth II and the rest of the royal family. The publication states, “By now the whole world knows Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are ditching the traditional royal Christmas – surly to his granny’s displeasure!” The article is full of details meant to create legitimacy but instead come across as weird tidbits based on nothing at all.</p>
      <p>These details include the cost of Christmas with the Clooneys and what the couples will be doing. The outlet quotes what it calls an “informant” as saying, “They’ve got a budget of $2 million, which might seem like a lot, but George and Amal are determined to give Harry, Meghan, and baby Archie a Christmas they’ll never forget” The dubious source claims to know everything about the menu, saying, “There will be a full American-style Christmas dinner, plus a vegan buffet since that’s the Clooneys’ diet a lot of the time. It’ll be full catered by a top Italian chef.” As for drinks, “George is going to dust off some of his finest vintages,” and the activities, “He’ll also treat them to use of his private jet and speedboats.”</p>
      <p>If all these ridiculous claims aren’t over-the-top enough, the tabloid’s alleged source adds that George has an ulterior motive as well. “George is seriously considering running for president in 2024 and wants to assemble a powerful posse,” says the seemingly phony source. “Harry and Meghan would be the jewel in his crown, so to speak, so he’s eager to secure their support.” It’s unclear why the actor would consider members of the British royal family “the jewel in his crown” in a bid for the U.S. presidency. That is only the tip of the problematic iceberg for the bogus story.</p>
      <p>How this anonymous source knows all these weird details more than a month in advance is odd, but the biggest issue for the tabloid: this false claim goes against the official word from the royal family themselves. Earlier this month, the duke and duchess announced they would <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/11/13/prince-harry-meghan-archie-skipping-queens-christmas/4180668002/">spend Christmas with Markle’s mother, and the Queen approves</a>. The official statement from a spokesperson for the royal couple read, “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are looking forward to extended family time towards the end of this month. Having spent the last two Christmases at Sandringham, Their Royal Highnesses will spend the holiday this year, as a new family, with the Duchess’ mother Doria Ragland.” That settles that. Prince Harry and Markle are spending Christmas with her mom, not the Clooneys.</p>
      <p><i>NW</i> has a bizarre fascination with connecting the duke and duchess with the Hollywood star. In April, the tabloid ran a piece alleging <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/george-clooney-meghan-markle-had-secret-fling-dated/">George and Markle had a secret fling in 2013</a>, before their respective marriages. The outlet never mentioned where the two connected or why this supposed tryst ended. In fact, it had remarkably little detail about the whole phony affair, because the truth was it never happened. <b>Gossip Cop</b> corrected the story, just as we can debunk the current one. The tabloid doesn’t have any insider knowledge about either couple.</p>
