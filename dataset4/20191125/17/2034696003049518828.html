      <p>ICYMI: we now have two radio channels here at <i>NME</i>! You can tune into NME 1 for a selection of stone-cold classics and indie anthems, while NME 2 will bring you the best of the past decade — from alternative bops to grime and leftfield dance.</p>
      <p>Each week Team <i>NME</i> carefully handpick a selection of tunes to add to both playlists — here are the <a href="https://www.nme.com/audio">NME 1 &amp; 2</a> playlist additions for this week.</p>
      <h3>On the A List</h3>
      <h4>Caroline Polachek – ‘So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings’</h4>
      <p>First up on the playlist we’ve got Caroline Polachek’s brilliant ‘So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings’.<b> </b>Taken from the Chairlift’s co-founder’s first solo release under her own name <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/caroline-polachek-pang-album-review">‘Pang’</a>, the slinky cut of squelchy electro-pop is a beauty. Fusing twinkling synth lines, a funk-flecked bass line and Polachek’s trilling vocals, it’s a standout track from her recent record.</p>

      <h3>On the B List</h3>
      <h4>Beck – ‘Dark Places’</h4>
      <p>Mixing whirring, spacey electronics with jangling acoustic guitar riffs, ‘Dark Places’ is a gorgeous example of Beck’s stratospheric songwriting.</p>

      <h4>Jessie Ware – ‘Mirage (Don’t Stop)’</h4>
      <p>The new one from Jessie Ware sees her get her groove on. Her soaring vocals float over lilting, house-flecked instrumentals and a jazzy bassline, in an excitingly unusual release for the musician.</p>

      <h4>Omar Apollo, Dominic Fike &amp; Kenny Beats – ‘Hit Me Up’</h4>
      <p>With its driving, earworm bass line and the skittering vocals, ‘Hit Me Up’ is a total slapper.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2p7m2iY-WSY" width="1024" height="576" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Princess Nokia – ‘Balenciaga’</h4>
      <p>This chilled-out tune from Princess Nokia sees her rapping about frugal fashion over frosty instrumentals. She’s explained that the song is about: “weird, off-kilter fashion and the blurred lines between fashion and style. It’s not anti-designer at all…it’s just a song about practicality and comfortability with one’s self.”</p>

      <h4>Silverbacks – ‘Sirens’</h4>
      <p>One for fans of The Strokes or Parquet Courts, the growling slice by Dublin quintet Silverbacks is a stonker.</p>

      <h3>On the C List</h3>
      <h4>Confidence Man – ‘Does It Make You Feel Good?’</h4>
      <p>Confidence Man’s latest absolutely does make you feel good. Combining massive ’90s dance breakdowns with Donna Summer-flecked vocals and a pounding bassline that’ll get you on your feet, it’s a welcome return from the party starting Aussie quartet.</p>

      <h4>Grimes – ‘So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth’</h4>
      <p>With its ethereal vocals and ghostly instrumentals, Grimes’ latest is weirdly beautiful.</p>

      <h4>Harry Styles – ‘Watermelon Sugar’</h4>
      <p>The second glimpse we’ve had of Harry Styles’ upcoming album ‘Fine Line’ is a belter. Mixing jangling ‘70s guitars with bolshy brass and breezy vocals, it’s a sweet slice of sunshine.</p>

      <h4>Mark Ronson &amp; Anderson .Paak – ‘Then There Were Two’</h4>
      <p>Taken from the soundtrack for animated film <i>Spies in Disguise</i>, this new collaboration from Mark Ronson &amp; Anderson .Paak combines the brazenness of a Bond song with Ronson’s stylish production and .Paak’s trademark charm, and it’s brilliant.</p>

      <h4>Slowdaze – ‘Today’</h4>
      <p>This one from Hull based collective Slowdaze is a bit like if Tame Impala teamed up with Anderson .Paak. Filled with hazy instrumentals, kaleidoscopic guitar lines and woozy vocals, it’s a total treat.</p>
