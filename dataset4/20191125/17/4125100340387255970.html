      <p>Chief Ademola Odunade, the President of a Mapo Customary Court in Ibadan, has dissolved a 13-year-old marriage between one Monsurat Owolabi and husband, Najim, over alleged threat to life.</p>
      <p>In his judgment, Odunade said that he dissolved the union between the couple because the relationship had been irreparably damaged.</p>
      <p>He advised spouses to do everything possible to ensure that there was trust in their relationship so as to enjoy lasting marriage.</p>
      <p>Odunade also said that the union was dissolved in the interest of tranquillity and awarded custody of the last child to Monsurat and the first two children to Najim.</p>
      <p>The arbitrator ordered the respondent to pay N5,000 as monthly feeding allowance for the last child, in addition to being responsible for her education and other welfare needs.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Monsurat, a resident of Amunloko area in Ibadan, said that her husband had for long been threatening her life.</p>

      <p>“When the economic situation in our family went bad, I decided to travel abroad in search of greener pasture so as to be able to feed our children, but Najim seemed not to understand.</p>
      <p>“I had to put the three children in the custody of my parents before travelling although he forcefully took charge of the children later.</p>
      <p>“My lord, there is no more love between Najim and me,’’ Monsurat said.</p>
      <p>The respondent, who consented to the suit, however, denied all the allegations.</p>

      <p>He said that his wife was economical with the truth.</p>
      <p>Najim, a businessman at Amunloko area, submitted that his wife and her parents were deceitful because of personal gains.</p>
      <p>“Monsurat suddenly told me one day that she was travelling to Saudi Arabia in search of greener pasture, but I told her to shelve the plan.</p>
      <p>“However, she had concluded the plan with her parents without my knowledge, abandoning me for no tangible reason.</p>
      <p>“I also observed that before she left, Monsurat stopped cooking for me.</p>
      <p>“Instead, she often prepared food for a married man living in our neighbourhood and in fact usually slept with him,” he said.</p>
