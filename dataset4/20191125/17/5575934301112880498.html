      <p>A baby girl named Itzmara was born through a cesarean delivery and, just 24 hours later, doctors performed a C-section on her too because she had absorbed her twin while in the womb, <a href="https://quemas.mamaslatinas.com/pregnancy/155379/baby-born-pregnant-barranquilla-colombia-needs-c-section">Mamas Latinas</a> reported in March.</p>
      <p>When the mother, Mónica Vega of Barranquilla, Colombia, had an ultrasound at seven months pregnant, doctors discovered she had two umbilical cords inside of her. One connected baby Itzmara to Vega, but the other connected Itzmara to a mass that was her parasitic twin.</p>
      <p>When doctors noticed this, they diagnosed Itzmara with <a href="https://www.insider.com/teen-had-tumor-with-teeth-unborn-twin-fetus-2019-9">foetus in fetu</a>, a rare condition where a malformed foetus is found in the body of its twin. The doctors said they needed to deliver Itzmara through a <a href="https://www.insider.com/woman-claims-she-had-c-section-without-anesthesia-lawsuit-2018-8">C-section right away</a> so they could then operate on the baby. They were worried if they didn’t remove the parasitic twin inside Itzmara, the mass could grow and potentially injure the baby’s organs.</p>
      <p>So after delivering Itzmara via C-section, the doctors performed a C-section on her too to remove the mass, which had no heart or brain. Itzmara was in good health following the surgery, Mamas Latinas reported.</p>
      <h3>The baby’s condition is extremely rare</h3>
      <p>According to the National Institutes of Health, foetus in fetu is very rare, with only one case occurring for about every 500,000 births. Additionally, authors of one <a href="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/12/8/e230835.info">foetus in fetu case study</a> published in August said only 200 previous cases of FIF have been documented in medical journals.</p>
      <p>FIF-related <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2810823/#CIT5">tumours are usually benign</a>, according to the National Institutes of Health, but sometimes can cause health problems, which Itzmara’s doctors were concerned about happening.</p>

      <h3>Not all foetus in fetu cases are treated right after birth</h3>
      <p>In some cases, foetus in fetu-related health problems take years to develop.</p>
      <p>In the <a href="https://www.insider.com/teen-had-tumor-with-teeth-unborn-twin-fetus-2019-9">August case study</a>, published in BMJ Case Reports, a 17-year-old teen in India showed up at a hospital complaining about abdominal pain and a growing lump in that same area which she said started developing five years prior. When doctors examined her, they found she had absorbed her parasitic twin in the womb and was now <a href="https://www.insider.com/health-issues-that-you-might-think-are-just-a-stomach-ache-2018-5">having stomach pains because of it</a>.</p>
      <p>To remove the tumour, doctors opened the teen’s stomach through surgery. Once opened, they found the tumour ran from her liver to her pelvic bone. They said it didn’t create any complications with other organs in her body besides a cyst, which they removed.</p>
      <p>In another case, a 27-year-old man recalled having the malformed mass since childhood but said it <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003497500022918">didn’t cause him any pain</a> until he was 26 years old. Doctors are unsure why this happens.</p>
