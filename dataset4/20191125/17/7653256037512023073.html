      <p>NEW DELHI: General <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Bipin-Rawat">Bipin Rawat</a> is on a series of farewell visits to military establishments as his tenure as the Army Chief draws to an end in December.</p>
      <p>However, the top officer is unlikely to shed his uniform anytime soon, with the decks being cleared for him to take over as the first <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Chief-of-Defence-Staff">Chief of Defence Staff</a> – a four star position being created as part of a defence management overhaul.</p>
      <p>General Bipin Rawat– who is serving a rare full three year term as the Army Chief after he superseded two officers in 2016 – is likely to get a term of over two years as the CDS, which will largely see the creation of a new structure to provide military advise to the government and implement joint procurement by the three services.</p>
      <p>The appointment of a new CDS is expected to be announced in December.</p>
      <p>Sources have confirmed that a committee tasked to draw out the role, responsibilities and powers of the CDS has submitted its report, which is to be approved by the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Cabinet-Committee-on-Security">Cabinet Committee on Security</a> (CCS). The recommendation includes creation of a post senior to the current service chiefs with an age limit of 64 years.</p>
      <p>As reported by ET, the government had tasked National Security Advisor (NSA) <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ajit-Doval">Ajit Doval</a> to head the committee for the setting up of a new position that was announced by PM <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Narendra-Modi">Narendra Modi</a> at his Independence Day address. While joint operations and tri-services commands are likely to be overseen by the CDS, the top officer is set to be heavily involved in procurement of military equipment as well.</p>
      <p>Given the shrinking capital budget of the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/defence-ministry">defence ministry</a>, this role will determine immediate procurement cycles for the three forces.</p>
