      <p>SINGAPORE: A man accused of <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/commonwealth-deaths-man-accused-murder-mum-grandma-gabriel-goh-12103532">killing his mother and grandmother</a> in Commonwealth last month will be taken back to the scene as part of investigations, a court heard on Monday (Nov 25).</p>
      <p>Gabriel Lien Goh, 22, appeared in court in person and hung his head low during the hearing.</p>

      <p>The police prosecutor asked for Goh to be remanded for a scene visit, to complete investigations and to recover evidence.</p>
      <p>He said Goh has not been remanded in the relevant division as he previously was at Changi Prison's Complex Medical Centre.</p>
      <p>The police have received a report from the Institute of Mental Health and will need to consult the Attorney-General's Chambers, with no date fixed for a pre-trial conference in High Court, the court heard.</p>
      <p>District Judge Brenda Tan ordered Goh to be remanded for a week. </p>
      <p>Goh had been charged first with killing his mother, 56-year-old Lee Soh Mui, at a seventh-floor unit in Block 7A Commonwealth Avenue on Oct 27.</p>
      <p>He was given a second charge of murdering his 90-year-old grandmother See Keng Keng at a different unit that day.</p>
      <p>In the last hearing, which he attended via video-link, Goh apologised to his relatives, saying what happened was an accident and that he "never intended for those things to happen".</p>
      <p>He had been arrested on the night of the incidents after the two women were found dead at the scene. </p>
      <p>Goh remains unrepresented and will return to court on Dec 2. If found guilty of murder, he faces the death penalty.</p>
