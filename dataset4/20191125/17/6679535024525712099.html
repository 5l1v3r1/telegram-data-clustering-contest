      <p>To raise awareness against fake helmets, Cyberabad police organised a programme where owners and dealers of the products broke the low-quality ones.</p>
      <p>At the programme organised in Cyberabad Police Commissionerate on Monday, they took an oath to curb sale of low-quality helmets, some of which are stamped with fake ISI mark.</p>
      <p>Cyberabad Police Commissioner VC Sajjanar said that 720 people died in fatal accidents in Cyberabad limits from January to October of 2019. “Of which, 388 deaths involve two-wheeler riders and pillion riders. Besides, 94% of the persons who died while riding two wheelers were either not wearing helmets or were wearing low-quality helmets,” Mr Sajjanar said.</p>
      <p>The Cyberabad Traffic Police constituted a team under Traffic Inspector M Srinivasulu from Cyberabad’s Road Traffic Accident Cases Monitoring Cell (RTAM Cell) to identify, raid shops and godowns selling and storing low-quality helmets in Cyberabad. The team identified the shops and registered 10 FIRs (criminal cases) against manufacturers and distributors of such helmets.</p>
      <p>Most of the low-quality helmets are being manufactured in various places in Delhi. They are sold for ₹200 and ₹500. “We are focusing on distributors and manufacturers,” Mr. Sajjanar said.</p>
