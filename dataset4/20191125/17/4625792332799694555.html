      <h1>Joy Behar: 'I think Facebook would give Hitler his own fan page'</h1>

      <p><i>The View </i>host Joy Behar slammed Facebook for not censoring false content from political campaigns on its platform, saying the network promoted "global propaganda."</p>
      <p>"I think Facebook would give Hitler his own fan page. Are you kidding?" Behar said Monday on the show. "Just like all the networks gave air time to Trump before they knew what a bad idea he was. Now we know what a bad idea he is, and we know what a bad idea Hitler was, and black racism and anti-Semitism. So now is the time to correct the situation."</p>
      <p>"This is global propaganda. Everyone in every part of the world hears this stuff, and then I just realized he said they microtarget the fans. So white nationalists can just increase their numbers all over the place," she added.</p>
      <p>The segment on the show was in response to Facebook's announcement it would not take down political ads on the platform with false information. Host Abby Huntsman hit back at Behar's assertion that Facebook would defend people such as Hitler, saying her comparison was, "A bit extreme."</p>
      <p>Huntsman argued we should "allow everyone to speak" even if it could be "ugly" at times. Behar has <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/the-view-host-immigration-raids-are-reminiscent-of-what-happened-to-jews-in-nazi-germany">compared President Trump to Hitler</a> before, saying that his planned immigration raids this summer were "reminiscent" of Nazi Germany.</p>
      <p>Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Michael Bennet, whose parents survived the Holocaust, corrected the host at the time for the comparison on the show saying the two things <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/watch-2020-democrat-blasts-joy-behar-for-using-nazi-comparison">should not be equated</a>.</p>
