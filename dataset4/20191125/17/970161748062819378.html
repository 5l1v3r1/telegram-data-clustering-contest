      <p>Iain Duncan Smith has slammed the ‘absolute morons’ who graffitied his constituency office with the words ‘Tory cuts kill’.</p>
      <p>One of the office windows was also sprayed with the words ‘Tories out’.</p>
      <p>The former secretary for the Department of Work and Pensions, says the incident is one of a number of ‘threats and death threats made to him and his family’ in recent months.</p>
      <p>The former Tory leader told the Evening Standard: ‘I have had violent threats, death threats to myself, threats to my family in the last few months.</p>
      <p>‘All these people are absolute morons – if they are a member of a political party they should be disowned.</p>
      <p>‘It is appalling that some people think they can shut down democracy.’</p>
