      <h1>Coercive control incidents double in a year, as campaigners warn domestic abuse “remains at epidemic levels”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:04:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/gabriella-swerling/" target="_blank">Gabriella Swerling</a></address>
      <p>Coercive control reports to police have doubled within a year, new figures reveal, as campaigners warn that the true extent of the crime is only just starting to be recognised. </p>
      <p>There were 17,616 offences of coercive control recorded by the police in the year ending March 2019, compared with 9,053 in the year ending March 2018, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.</p>
      <p>Charities and campaigners have welcomed the increasing awareness surrounding coercive control, but have also warned that domestic abuse “remains at epidemic levels” and. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/11244275/New-domestic-violence-law-will-outlaw-coercive-control.html">It was not until 2015 </a>until coercive control was officially criminalised in law and recognised as a form of domestic abuse. </p>
      <p>The term became mainstream after earlier this summer, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/06/07/sally-challen-mother-bludgeoned-husband-death-hammer-will-not/">Sally Challen, who had been in prison for almost a decade, became the first person to successfully use it as a defence </a>after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) accepted her plea of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. </p>
      <p>The 65-year-old mother-of-two bludgeoned her abusive husband to death in a hammer attack in the kitchen of their Surrey home in August 2010 after decades of being coerced and humiliated by him.</p>
      <p>Mrs Challen’s son, David, who successfully campaigned for his mother’s freedom, told The Telegraph: “The significant increase in cases of coercive control offences reported is a vital step forward in domestic abuse. </p>
      <p>“However, it is even more vital to listen to these victims who’ve come forward and recognise that this form of abuse is as severe as physical violence. It is up to the police and the criminal courts to start instilling that trust if we’re to continue to gain victims confidence coming forward.”</p>
      <p>Coercive control is a form of behaviour designed to make a person dependent by isolating them from support, exploiting them, depriving them of independence and regulating their everyday behaviour. It usually manifests itself in an act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten their victim.</p>
      <p>The ONS said that the increase in the number of coercive control offences “are common for new offences” and the rise could be attributed to “improvements in recognising incidents of coercive control by the police and using the new law accordingly”.</p>
      <p>Researchers also reported that there were a total of 1,316,800 domestic abuse-related incidents and crimes recorded by the police in England and Wales in the year ending March 2019, up 118,706 from the previous year.</p>
      <p>Of these, 746,219 were subsequently recorded as crimes, up from 599,549 in the previous year – a volume increase of 146,670 (24%).</p>
      <p>However police only made 98,470 referrals to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for suspects in domestic-abuse related cases to be charged, down from 110,653 the previous year.</p>
      <p>There were also 366 domestic homicides recorded by the police in England and Wales between April 2016 and March 2018, accounting for 20% of all killings of victims aged over 16.</p>
      <p>Deputy Chief Constable Louisa Rolfe, who leads the National Police Chiefs’ Council’s work on domestic abuse, said the fall in charging referrals was “concerning” and it was working with the CPS to “understand the complex reasons for this.”</p>
      <p>She added: “The large increases in reporting comes alongside more complex and demanding investigations and the pressure on police resources.</p>
      <p>“Arrests and prosecutions may provide a temporary respite for victims but a public health response is vital to keep people safe and provide a lasting solution.”</p>
      <p>Adina Claire, Acting Co-Chief Executive of Women’s Aid, added: “It is encouraging that the coercive control legislation is being used more and that recorded incidents have almost doubled. </p>
      <p>“However, domestic abuse remains at epidemic levels, with an estimated 1.6 million women experiencing domestic abuse last year alone. Despite this, police are making fewer referrals to the CPS and there has been a decrease in the proportion of female victims reporting domestic abuse to the police.</p>
      <p>“What these statistics show is that, while domestic abuse can happen to anyone, women experience the most severe and repeated forms of abuse. 84% of homicide victims killed by a current or former partner are female, which shows why specialist refuge services for women, including expert services for BME women, have to exist.”</p>
