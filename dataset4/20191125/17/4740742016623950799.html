      <h1>Bristol City's Lee Johnson explains his side of Aaron Wilbraham 'argument' over Joe Bryan</h1>
      <h2>The head coach gives his version of events regarding former Robins starlet, 'Alby' and his agent.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:36:54+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:36</time> by <a rel="author">Gregor MacGregor</a></address>
      <p>It was one of the big stories from last week for Bristol City fans: that very revealing podcast from Aaron Wilbraham on his life and times in football.</p>
      <p>Wilbraham is much loved in the West Country and was a key part of that special double-winning side under Steve Cotterill in 2014/15.</p>
      <p>Discussing his time at Ashton Gate <a href="https://youtu.be/SVxCj0M23HY">on the Undr the Cosh podcast</a>, Wilbraham was asked his opinion of Johnson, and the veteran forward recounted an argument the pair shared early in the head coach's tenure in BS3 in 2016.</p>
      <p>The Robins boss was <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/how-aaron-wilbraham-lee-johnson-3556499">annoyed that Wilbraham's agent had spoken to</a> then young City starlet Joe Bryan with the suspicion that the conversation would lead to a move away from Ashton Gate.</p>
      <p>At the pre-West Brom press conference we asked the head coach about those events. Johnson said he had not listened to the podcast himself.Â </p>
      <p>"He [Aaron Wilbraham] was a good player for the football club. These things happen," said Johnson, speaking at the pre-West Brom press conference.</p>

      <p>"I don't like it effectively when players tell tales but on that occasion it was not a footballer's job to...</p>
      <p>"Because what happens is the agents promise them jobs or they give them some money or whatever to go and hook somebody in. And therefore the influence inside the dressing room is just as important as outside the dressing room.</p>
      <p>"I'm not saying don't give advice in that type of scenario but don't actively push a player into an area," the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-transcript-nottingham-forest-3555566">Bristol City</a> boss said.</p>
      <p>Did that conversation eventually lead to Joe Bryan moving on and leaving Ashton Gate, with the left-back signing for the Cottagers on the last day of the transfer window in the summer of 2018?</p>
      <p>Bryan played 28 times for Fulham in the Premier League before their relegation and has made 16 appearances in the Championship this campaign, with City travelling to Craven Cottage on Saturday 7, December.</p>
      <p>"Well it was all part of it," added Johnson.</p>

      <p>"I don't think Joe ever in his head wanted to stay, to be honest. I think he wanted a change - unless we threw the sort of money at him that we can't.</p>
      <p>"I don't think it was in his head to stay. I think he felt he wanted a change having been here since he was seven years old and sometimes you can understand that.</p>
      <p>"He wanted to play Premier League football and again people talk, he didn't quite get that Premier League football [at Bristol City] but he did in the end because of their [Fulham's] promotion."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-transcript-nottingham-forest-3555566">Bristol City</a> head to the Midlands tomorrow before facing the Baggies at 8pm on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>The squad should be swelled by the return of club record signing Tomas Kalas.</p>
      <p>"Kalas could be available. We'll assess," Johnson said.</p>
      <p>"There could be a number available. Jack Hunt could be available, Taylor Moore could be available."</p>
