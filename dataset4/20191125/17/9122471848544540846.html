      <h1>ESPN Analyst Lays Out Scenario Where The SEC Gets 3 Teams In The Playoff</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:12:22+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>The College Football Playoff has only had two teams from one conference once – two years ago when Georgia and Alabama were both selected. One ESPN analyst – Peter Burns of the SEC Network – laid out a scenario where three teams from the SEC could go this year.</p>
      <p>Burns believes that there are seven things that need to happen for Georgia, LSU and Alabama all to make it. It’s obviously possible, but very, very unlikely.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma State would have to upset Oklahoma in Bedlam. The Sooners would then have to turn around and beat Baylor in the Big 12 title game.</p>
      <p>Ohio State would have to lose to Michigan, and then lose again in the Big Ten title game to Wisconsin, which (in this scenario) beat Minnesota the week prior.</p>
      <p>Georgia would have to beat LSU. Oregon would have to beat Utah.</p>
      <p>In that scenario, the champions for the Pac-12, Big 12 and Big Ten would all have two losses. Clemson, assuming it won the ACC, would get in with three one-loss SEC teams.</p>

      <p>Burns is right in saying that this would create a meltdown. You’d have an eight-team playoff very soon after something like this happening.</p>
      <p>Again, this isn’t going to happen. But if it did, the college football world would collectively lose its mind.</p>
