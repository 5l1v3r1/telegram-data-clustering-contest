      <h1>Mourinho: 'No chance' Zlatan joins Spurs</h1>

      <p>Jose Mourinho says as fond as he is of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, he has no intentions of bringing him to Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <p>Following Spurs' 3-2 win over West Ham on the weekend, Mourinho said a reunion with the free-agent hitman doesn't make any sense.</p>
      <p>"[An] amazing player, amazing guy, but I would say no chance," <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/50549364">Mourinho said of the player he coached at both Inter and Manchester United</a>. "We have the best striker in England. It doesn't make sense to sign him when we have Harry Kane."</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic, 38, is out of contract as of last week, finishing up a two-year stint with the LA Galaxy with whom he scored 52 times in 56 appearances.</p>
      <p>The former Sweden international is widely expected to return to Europe and has been attached to a host of clubs including Napoli and Bologna, as well as potential returns to former clubs United and Inter.</p>
      <p>A native of Malmo, Ibrahimovic has also played for Ajax, Juventus, Milan and Paris Saint-Germain over his decorated senior career that has spanned over two decades.</p>
