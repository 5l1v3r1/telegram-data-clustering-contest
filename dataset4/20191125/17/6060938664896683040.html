      <p>The chief coach of the Indian women's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/hockey">hockey</a> team <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sjoerd-Marijne">Sjoerd Marijne</a> wears his emotions on his sleeves. Expressing himself has never been a problem for the Dutchman. During India's Olympic qualifiers against USA in Bhubaneswar earlier this month, the ebb and flow of the games played out on his face, as he egged his players on.</p>
      <p>The 45-year-old's journey from coaching the Netherlands' women's hockey team to the Indian women and then the men before finally being reunited with the Indian women's team has been eventful to say the least.</p>
      <p>Having helped the team book their ticket to Tokyo, Marijne, a sought-after motivational speaker, recounted the charge. He underlined how the once diffident bunch is now more assertive on and off the field.</p>

          <i>Excerpts:</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Was it difficult to return to the women's team after a not-so-pleasant exit from the men's side, following the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/2018-Commonwealth-Games">2018 Commonwealth Games</a>, where the team failed to finish on the podium?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The journey with the men's team was a long time ago. I don't think about it anymore because what I don't like about that period was that I could not finish my job. As a coach, you don't want to leave a job half done. So, I don't like to look back. Instead, I look forward. I'm happy with the women's team and we connect well. We are now focused on delivering a good account of ourselves at the Olympics.</p>
      <p>
        <b>With the women's team, what were the challenges you encountered, game-wise and culturally in the first (10 months, from Feb 2017) and second stints (from May 2018)?</b>
      </p>
      <p>When you come from the top-ranked team to a team which is ranked 13th in the world, there will be differences game-wise, but that can be dealt with. Overall it was very different from anything I had experienced before, from training method to pace of the game. The biggest difference was culture. To see how they were raised and their experiences, which made them who they are, opened my eyes to various aspects of life. I realized that I had to coach this group of players differently from what we did back in Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Many of the players told me, 'please shout if we make a mistake'. I was surprised because I hadn't heard that before and I would never do that. What I struggled with though was communication. Whenever I gave them instructions they would always say, "yes sir, yes sir", but what transpired on the pitch was completely different.</p>
      <p>The first couple of months was frustrating, very frustrating, because I probably wanted to move much ahead than what they could cope with.</p>
      <p>This brought about a change in me because, I was used to the fact that if I say something, the understanding of it is quick and complete. Here, it took me months to implement the way I wanted them to play. I think the FIH <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hockey-World-League">Hockey World League</a> Semifinals (July 2017) was the most frustrating. That was the only tournament where we did not make the top-eight. After that we went to Netherlands (September 2017) on an exposure tour and everything changed there. That's when they realised what I wanted from them.</p>
      <p>That was such a good tour, everything fell in place. The communication became easier. That also helped me develop as a coach. It made me more patient on and off the pitch.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What exactly changed in the Netherlands?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The change happened before we landed in Netherlands. During our match against Argentina in the FIH Hockey World League Semifinals, I was talking to the team during the break and their eyes were blank. I walked away thinking I was talking to a wall. I almost thought, I couldn't change it. We arrived back in the camp before the Dutch tour and I told the girls, it is not enough if the coach wants to win badly. As players, you'll should have the will to win more than the coach. You have to show initiative. In this camp, show me how much you want to play for the country. In this camp of 33 girls, the players with the most desire will be selected, even if they are not the best. They finally understood me!</p>
      <p>
        <b>What was completely new to you when you started your India experience?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The respect a player has for a coach in India is very huge. That's good, but not in excess. One of the things that I had to do was open a channel of communication. In one of the first meetings, I asked a question and nobody answered. They had an empty look on their faces. I didn't see any emotions. It was hard to digest because for me one of the basics is talking and debating with the coach because he too can go wrong.</p>
      <p>I also need feedback to know if something is working, or what is right or wrong. Here, for everything I said, there was always a 'yes sir'. They didn't want to ask questions because they found it embarrassing. They thought they would displease me if they asked questions and I wouldn't pick them for the next tournament. I had to explain to them that if they don't understand, I don't mind explaining repeatedly. Once they trusted me, they began to open up and ask more questions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Did you think of packing your bags and leaving at any time?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I'm not a quitter. I have a very strong mindset and willpower. If I have something on my mind, I go all out to achieve it. I may not be successful in the first attempt, but I don't give up. Quitting is never an option for me. I spoke to my wife Brigitte Marijne a lot. It helps when you have a family which loves and understands sport. She is always a call away.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Did it help that you are also a father to a teenage daughter?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, it definitely helps because you understand the players better. They don't see their fathers often, so they do come and talk to me about things beyond hockey. I've also emphasised on the need to have interests beyond hockey, especially since we work with a tunnel vision where our focus is always on hockey. I've tried to bring them out of their comfort zone and make them realise that in that zone they cannot grow as players or individuals. In the last two-and-half years we have pulled them out of the comfort zone both on and off the pitch. They did a presentation on Indian women's hockey in English at an university (Jain University) some time back, they were sweating for a week about it. At the presentation they were so good that it gave them a sense of pride.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you also use any tool to understand the players better?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, we use a profiling tool called VIP24. It has 80 questions about various aspects of their life and personality. With that a profile is created, so I have one on each of the players. It also helps me understand their behaviour, personality and motor skills.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What about handling pressure in Tokyo?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pressure of playing the home matches during the qualifiers was more pressure than the Olympics. More than pressure, there is determination. The team feels they didn't show India what they are capable of and at Tokyo they want to showcase that. They were disappointed about that and want to improve.</p>
      <p>
        <b>In the coming months, how do you plan to manage the workload?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ongoing camp is more of a conditioning camp, because we don't have too many of these next year. I hope we have three tours. We want to keep their minds and legs fresh so the plan is three weeks work and one-week rest. I've told them we have nothing to lose, we have everything to win. We saw glimpses of that attitude at the qualifiers. The first half we played with the fear of losing and in the second, it was the fight to win.</p>
