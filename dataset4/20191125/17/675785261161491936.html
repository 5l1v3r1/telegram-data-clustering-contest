      <h2>The Saudi Arabia venue which will host the second bout between Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz Jr has been completed in Diriyah ahead of their December 7 showdown</h2>

      <p>The purpose-built arena which will host Anthony Joshua's rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr has been completed.</p>
      <p>The former heavyweight world champion took a tour of the venue on Sunday after touching down in Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>Almost two hundred staff have worked around the clock for the last two months to construct the 15,000-seat Diriyah Arena which will be pulled down again after the final bell.</p>
      <p>"The arena and site are utterly breath-taking, with a theme park and concert the night before as well," said promoter Eddie Hearn.</p>
      <p>"It's like nothing we've seen before in boxing. The Clash On The Dunes will be a night to remember - we can't wait."</p>

      <p>Joshua will bid to win back his three belts on Saturday week having been dethroned by Ruiz in June in one of the biggest shocks in boxing history.</p>
      <p>Upon arriving in the desert, Joshua said: "It's going to be an incredible night and I'm thrilled so many of my fans are going to be there, particularly from the UK.</p>
      <p>"It'll definitely be a night people will tell their grandchildren they were at, one of those iconic evenings of boxing. Everyone from Saudi has been brilliant to work with."</p>

      <p>Concerns have been raised over Saudi Arabia's horrific human rights record and the country's bid to change its image through sport.</p>
      <p>But both Joshua and Hearn have dismissed suggestions they were wrong to take the fight to the Middle East.</p>
      <p>Ruiz was reluctant to face Joshua in Cardiff and was eventually convinced to travel from New York to the Gulf.</p>

      <p>"The only thing I’m doing differently is sparring. I’ve got a lot of different sparring partners in case he tries to switch his style up – in case he tries to box, or keep me away with the jab. We’re practicing.</p>
      <p>"I’ve had an almost three-month camp for this fight. We’ve got more things done. We’ve practiced what AJ is going to do."</p>
