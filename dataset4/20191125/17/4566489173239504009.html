      <h2>One of the key aspects for maintaining healthcare hygiene is the application of cleaning agents followed by disinfectants. This is part of the on-going battle against hospital acquired infections. But just how good are the disinfectants?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:19:14+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/user/429626" target="_blank">Tim Sandle</a></address>
      <p>The focus of the new review into the effectiveness of disinfectants in the hospital setting is with <i>Clostridium difficile</i> (C. diff). The organism is <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/c-difficile/">a Gram-positive species of spore-forming bacteria</a>. Pathogenic <i>C. difficile</i> strains produce multiple toxins, and this presents a particular risk in the healthcare setting.</p>
      <p>Concerns from the research are that the organism is winning the battle against hospital-grade disinfectants. The survival of C. diff in hospitals carries a risk due to the fact that within one month of diagnosis, one in 11 people over age 65 dies of a health care-associated C. diff infection in the U.S.</p>
      <p>A <a href="http://www.pharmamicroresources.com/2019/07/disinfectant-efficacy-testing-for.html">disinfectant is a chemical that has been assessed</a> against a standard (such as the European CEN or US AOAC) to demonstrate that the chemical is capable of reducing a population of microorganisms down to a safe level on an inanimate object (such as a bed rail or ward floor). Sometimes the word ‘sanitizer’ is used in place of ‘disinfectant’, although this causes unnecessary confusion.</p>
      <p>Robust disinfectant efficacy testing involves challenging a range of different microorganisms (so that the spectrum of microcidal activity can be assessed) against a range of different surface materials.</p>

      <p><a href="https://uh.edu/news-events/stories/2019/november-2019/110619-kevin-gary-hospital-cdiff-cleansers.php">According to lead researcher Professor Kevin Garey</a>: “We found no disinfectant was able to completely eliminate <i>C. difficile</i> embedded within biofilms, although we did note differences among disinfectants".</p>
      <p>Biofilms are slime-like communities of organisms <a href="http://www.pharmamicroresources.com/2019/07/new-dispersion-method-to-kill-biofilm.html">that can become embedded onto a surface</a>. These communities provide a defence mechanism against the application of a disinfectant and pose a risk on medical devices. The centre of a biofilm is often anaerobic, which creates optimal conditions for C. diff.</p>
      <p>The researchers found that disinfectants with the trade-names Clorox, Cidex OPA, and Virex branded disinfectants were most effective at killing C. diff spores. However, each disinfectant had limitations.</p>
      <p>For the research, five different C. diff strains, embedded in three different biofilm types grown for 72 or 120 hours, were exposed to seven different hospital disinfectants.</p>
      <p>The scientists hope that the research will help to improve disinfectant efficacy.</p>
      <p>The new research is <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AAC.01031-19">published in</a> the journal <i>Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy</i>, and the paper is titled “Activity of Hospital Disinfectants against Vegetative Cells and Spores of <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> Embedded in Biofilms.”</p>
