      <p>Andy Whyment’s wife Nichola has revealed she warned him to ‘sort his head out’ before entering I'm a Celebrity.</p>
      <p>The Coronation Street star was a late arrival into this year's reality show.</p>
      <p>And speaking to Ok! magazine ahead of her husband entering the show, the actor's wife Nichola admitted she had told him he needed to 'sort his head out', revealing: “100 percent you will cry.”</p>
      <p>“I’ve told him he needs to sort his head out beforehand and mentally prepare for how hard it will be to be away from us.</p>
      <p>“He’s been told by castmates who have done the show before how slowly time goes in there, so weeks can feel like months.”</p>

      <p>While Andy admitted, it was possibly he could cry, revealing since becoming a father he had been more emotional, explaining: “I never used to cry at things but since becoming a dad, I get emotional watching my children do well and feeling proud. Maybe you will see me cry when I’m in there.”</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/">ITV</a> funny man, aged 38, and his better half tied the knot together in a ceremony surrounded by close friends and family back in 2007 and have two gorgeous children together, a boy called Thomas and a girl called Hollie</p>
      <p>But, since entering the Australian jungle along with 11 other celebrities including Jacqueline Jossa, Ian Wright and Nadine Coyle, mum of two Nichola said she’s happy to see how well her hubby has settled in.</p>
      <p>She told OK! magazine: “Andy is living his best life in the jungle! I think he just showed everyone how excited he is to be there."</p>
      <p>And she even revealed she hadn't seen him laugh like he has on the show in years, adding:</p>

      <p>“I’ve not seen him laugh that much in so long. I hope he doesn't struggle too much in the jail camp as he loves his food and sleep.”</p>
      <p>Previously, Andy, who is aged 38, revealed that he and Nicola never fight at home - even after being together for more than 15 years: "I’ve been punching above my weight for years - she’s gorgeous! I’m a very lucky bloke.</p>
      <p>"We’ve been together 14 years and we just don’t argue. We get on so well."</p>
