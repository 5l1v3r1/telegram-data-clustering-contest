      <p>Accra, Nov 25, GNA - The Ghanaian High Commission, United Kingdom (UK) has expressed dismay over the mistreatment of Mr Ebenezer Azamati, a Ghanaian MPhil student at the Oxford University by the University’s security officials.</p>
      <p>A Press release copied to the Ghana News Agency, said the Commission’s attention was drawn to a video on Saturday, November 16 in which Mr Azamati, visually impaired student was manhandled by security officials of the institution at an event organised in October 2019 by the Oxford Union of which the MPhil student was a member</p>
      <p>The statement said the Commission put in efforts to contact relevant officials of the University, the Oxford Union and the victim, and looked forward to hearing from them soon.</p>
      <p>“However, while the High Commission awaits a positive feedback before it proceeds to hold a dialogue with all stakeholders on the matter, it condemns in no uncertain terms the mistreat of Mr Azamati, by the security officials, especially when they knew that he was visually impaired.”</p>
      <p>The Ghana High Commission said it considered the welfare of Ghanaians who studied in Educational Institutions in the UK of paramount importance and therefore called on all such Educational Institutions and affiliated organizations to treat Ghanaian students in the UK with utmost respect and dignity.</p>
