      <p>Surgeons in India’s national capital have removed a kidney weighing 7.4 kg from the abdomen of a 56-year-old Delhi resident. They claim it be the world's largest kidney removed, equalling the weight of two newborn babies.</p>
      <blockquote>"While a normal human kidney weighs between 120-150 gm, this kidney equalled the weight of two newborn human babies," said Dr. Sachin Kathuria, urology consultant at the city’s Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.</blockquote>
      <p>It took a two-hour surgery to remove the organ whose dimensions were 32 x 21.8 cm. It had occupied almost the entire abdominal cavity of the patient.</p>
      <blockquote>"Although pre-operative scans showed a <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201911151076910866-russian-scientists-create-wearable-artificial-kidney/">huge kidney</a>, even we did not expect it will be the heaviest," Dr Kathuria said.</blockquote>
      <p>The Guinness World Records mentions the removal of a kidney weighing 4.25 kg by doctors in 2017 from a patient suffering from polycystic kidney disease.</p>
      <p>The doctors at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital have plans to apply to the Guinness World Records.</p>
      <p>The doctors said that the<a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911011077199379-air-pollution-in-indias-capital-statutory-panel-declares-health-emergency-in-delhi/"> patient</a> has since recovered and has been discharged from the hospital. He is undergoing dialysis and waiting for a renal transplant.</p>
