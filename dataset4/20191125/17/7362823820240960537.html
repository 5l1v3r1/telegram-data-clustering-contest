      <h1>Daniel Craig confirms he's done with James Bond after wrapping 'No Time To Die'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:44:36+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:44</time> by <a rel="author">Tyler McCarthy</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news">Daniel Craig</a> confirmed, in no uncertain terms, that he’s done playing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies/james-bond">James Bond</a> following his upcoming starring role in “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies">No Time To Die</a>.”</p>
      <p>The 51-year-old actor, who currently stars in the film “Knives Out,” appeared on “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/stephen-colbert">The Late Show With Stephen Colbert</a>” Friday and the host asked him point-blank if he had any plans to reprise the “Bond” role in a future movie or project.</p>
      <p>“When you’re done with Bond, are you done with Bond?” Colbert asked.</p>

      <p>“Yes,” <a href="https://youtu.be/Dq8nR7EiIXU">Craig replied</a>.</p>
      <p>“You’re done with Bond?! Wow. Is that why you’ve gained all the weight?” the host joked.</p>

      <p>While it’s perhaps the most unequivocal statement from Craig that he <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/james-bond-movie-ends-filming">won’t return as Britain’s favorite spy</a>, fans likely aren't surprised as it echoes previous comments he’s made in the past. Speaking in 2015 to <a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/film/daniel-craig-interview-my-advice-to-the-next-james-bond-dont-be-shit">Time Out Britain</a>, the actor said he’d rather slash his wrists than do another Bond movie.</p>

      <p>Still, rumblings that this would be his last outing as the acclaimed character – after starring in “Casino Royale,” “Quantum of Solace,” “Skyfall” and “Spectre” – heated up after rumors swirled that the next movie would act as a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/pierce-brosnan-female-james-bond-007">torch-passing</a> from Craig to a different actor. Actress <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lashana-lynch-backlash-007-james-bond">Lashana Lynch previously addressed the backlash</a> she received after rumors hinted that the 31-year-old would be taking over the role of the legendary MI6 agent.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t dishearten me," she told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/how-lashana-lynch-ana-de-armas-are-helping-modernize-james-bond-1252345">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. "It makes me feel quite sad for some people because their opinions, they’re not even from a mean place — they’re actually from a sad place."</p>

      <p>"It’s not about me. People are reacting to an idea, which has nothing to do with my life," she added.</p>
