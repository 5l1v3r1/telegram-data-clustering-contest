      <h1>Selena Gomez Had a Panic Attack Before Her AMA Performance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:52:19+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://collegecandy.com/author/shivanisx17/" target="_blank">Shivani Singh</a></address>
      <p>On Sunday, many stars performed at the 2019 American Music Awards (AMA), including <u><a href="http://collegecandy.com/tag/selena-gomez/">Selena Gomez</a></u>. She opened the show with her newest hit songs “Lose You to Love Me” and “Look at Her Now.” Even though her performance was well executed and fans were loving it, Gomez had “put a lot of pressure” on herself backstage just moments before. It was her first time performing at the AMAs in two years.</p>
      <p>A source revealed to E! News, “Selena definitely had anxiety and a panic attack before she went out and was putting a lot of pressure on herself.” Billboard also confirms that there were technical issues while Gomez was performing, “…the press room is having a hard time hearing anything with the volume turned way down on the monitors. Thankfully, the sound gets turned up for the very end of Gomez’s triumphant return to the stage.” Despite all the issues that Gomez faced prior to and during her performance, she pulled through and delivered a stellar performance.</p>

      <p>Gomez constantly puts on a brave face. She received support from her fans and her friend, <u><a href="http://collegecandy.com/tag/taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a></u>, during her performance as they cheered her on.</p>

      <p>Gomez has received treatment for anxiety and depression and even took time off last year to handle it.  Earlier this month, she did an <u><a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29764814/selena-gomez-raquelle-stevens-giving-back-generation-interview-quotes/">interview with her friend Raquelle Stevens</a></u> and spoke about how faith and her friends help her pull through her hard times. “My faith for sure [helps me when I’m feeling depressed or anxious],” Gomez told Stevens, holding back tears. “It’s probably your fault that I’m crying. Yes, I think once I started to really understand my spirituality, and believing in something much bigger than myself was very important for me. Because I don’t believe that I can do this life alone. I know that we’re not perfect. I know that what I read in the Word that I live in is all kinds of stories of pain and trials and redemption and restoration, so I believe that so much, but it’s my friends too. You guys help me through a lot of it and you walk through most of it with me.”</p>
