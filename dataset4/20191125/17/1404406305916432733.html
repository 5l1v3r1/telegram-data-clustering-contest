      <p>Producers Bink and Mike Dean went at one another on Twitter after Dean claimed that he "made the whole section" of Kanye's "Devil in a New Dress" track on <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i>. This comes after Billboard named the project <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/259117/billboard-names-kanyes-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy-album-of-decade"> "Album of the Decade." </a></p>
      <p>Bink disagreed with Dean, tweeting, "F**k you! To all these stupid ass platforms that left me out of my record for the 9th year in a row! No excuse!! Plain disrespectful! @therealmikedean has never done anything like this in his career BY HIMSELF!" In a since-deleted tweet, Bink also wrote, "To all that know me know I don’t need no LAME ASS WHITE BOY to help me with sh*t! He’s putting on for the net rt now! @therealmikedean know f**king well he has never and will never be as soulful as me! Foh."</p>
      <p>Dean shot back and told Bink that he "killed the beat," but added, "I did take it to another dimension with the switch up." You can read their full back and forth above. </p>
