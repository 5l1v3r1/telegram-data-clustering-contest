      <h1>Polly Hudson: Forget Ghosting - now we're making a big show about relationships</h1>
      <h2>It appears that whoever thinks up new terms to describe dating practices is exhausted, and fully out of ideas... not me!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:24:53+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:24</time> by <a rel="author">Polly Hudson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/polly-hudson/</a></address>
      <p>Bleed any well for long enough and it will eventually run dry.</p>
      <p>And so, post Ghosting, Breadcrumbing and Benching, it appears that whoever thinks up new terms to describe dating practices is exhausted, and fully out of ideas.</p>
      <p>But fear not, all we need to do is shift our gaze sideways... so now there’s Fleabagging, which means repeatedly going out with people who are wrong for you, just like Fleabag did.</p>
      <p>Let’s not stop here. Why ever would we? There are so many other TV shows that are perfect fodder <br/>for this...</p>
      <p><b>Friendsing</b> – being will they/won’t they for so long that everyone’s lost interest by the time you actually do.</p>
      <p><b>Newsnighting</b> – your partner interrogates you every time you sit down for a chat.</p>
      <p><b>EastEndersing</b> – going out with someone only to discover they’re really your muvver.</p>
      <p><b>Bodyguarding</b> – getting together with a colleague, with explosive consequences.</p>
      <p><b>Dallasing</b> – finding out your relationship was all a dream.</p>
      <p><b>Black Mirroring</b> – finding out your relationship was all a simulation.</p>
      <p><b>Line Of Dutying</b> - not getting together with a colleague even though everyone wishes you would.</p>
      <p><b>Have I Got News For Youing</b> – staying in a relationship for years past the sell-by date, even though it’s <br/>clear neither of you are enjoying it any more.</p>
      <p><b>Chernobyling</b> – a toxic relationship.</p>
      <p><b>Handmaids Taleing</b> – a relationship with an unequal power balance.</p>
      <p><b>Life On Marsing</b> – repeatedly going back to an ex.</p>
      <p><b>Goggleboxing</b> – a relationship where you just stay in and watch telly all the time.</p>
      <p><b>Sex And The Citying</b> – it’s obvious who you’re going to end up with from the start but you take ages to get there, and should have stayed with Aidan anyway, you idiot.</p>
      <p><b>Good Morning Britaining</b> – being in a love-hate relationship with someone your friends and family can’t stand.</p>
      <p><b>Casualtying</b> – a relationship where you always end up getting hurt.</p>
      <p><b>Sopranosing</b> – only being with someone because they made you an offer you couldn’t refuse.</p>
      <p><b>Losting</b> - a relationship you carry on with, despite not <br/>really enjoying it any more, because you hope it will all make sense in the end. It doesn’t.</p>
      <p><b>The Muppet Showing</b> - no strings attached.</p>
      <p><b>Star Trekking</b> - to boldly go where no man has gone before, ie your first physical relationship.</p>
      <p><b>Seinfelding</b> - a relationship about nothing.</p>
