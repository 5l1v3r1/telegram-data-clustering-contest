      <h1>Apple’s Newest Holiday Video Will Make You Cry</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:49:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/andrew-orr/" target="_blank">Andrew Orr</a></address>
      <p>Apple’s newest holiday video is a real tearjerker. A family goes to grandpa’s house for the holidays, and during the trip the parents give the kids an iPad as a way to keep them occupied. When they get to grandpa’s house, it’s a somber atmosphere. We learn that grandma is no longer with them, but the two girls make something special with the iPad as a present. The song is <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/married-life/1440617705?i=1440617708">Married Life by Michael Giacchino</a>, from the <i>Up</i> movie.</p>
