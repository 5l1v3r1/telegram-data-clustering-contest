      <p>Nov. 25 (UPI) -- <i>Anne with an E</i> will end with a third and final season.</p>
      <p>Netflix confirmed Monday that Season 3 will be the show's last. The season will be released Jan. 3 on Netflix.</p>
      <p>Netflix shared the release date alongside a poster of Amybeth McNulty as Anne Shirley. The image shows Anne wearing a blue coat and one of her signature hair ribbons.</p>
      <p>"The third and final season of #AnneWithAnE premieres January 3," the <a href="https://twitter.com/seewhatsnext/status/1199004783585189888/photo/1">post</a> reads.</p>
      <p><i>Anne with an E </i>is based on the Lucy Montgomery novel <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>. The show initially premiered on CBC in 2017 and streams on Netflix in the U.S.</p>
      <p>Moira Walley-Beckett created the show, which co-stars Geraldine James as Marilla Cuthbert, R.H. Thompson as Matthew Cuthbert, Dalila Bela as Diana Berry and Lucas Jade Zumann as Gilbert Blythe.</p>
      <p>"We've been thrilled to bring the quintessentially Canadian story of Anne with an E to viewers around the world," CBC and Netflix said in a joint <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/anne-an-e-end-season-3-netflix-1257863">statement</a>. "We hope fans of the show love this final season as much as we do, and that it brings a satisfying conclusion to Anne's journey."</p>
      <p>Walley-Beckett confirmed the news in an Instagram<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5S1agPHVDD"> post</a> Monday.</p>
      <p>"I wish it could be different but it cannot. We have reached the end of the red Green Gables road after 3 wonderful seasons," she wrote. "I know you have loved this series as much as I have and I thank for that forever and a day."</p>
      <p><i>Anne with an E</i> follows Anne (McNulty), a spirited teenage orphan girl who goes to live with a brother and sister (James and Thompson) on the farm Green Gables in the 19th century.</p>
