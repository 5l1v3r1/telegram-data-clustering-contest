      <p><a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?subId1=newsroom_affiliate_112519_mandalorian-beats-stranger-things&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F">Disney Plus</a>' live-action "Star Wars" series, "The Mandalorian," has made waves since it debuted on November 12 (thanks in no small part to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rian-johnson-saw-baby-yoda-on-the-mandalorian-set-2019-11">"Baby Yoda"</a>). And now the series has dethroned the streaming champion.</p>
      <p>Netflix's "Stranger Things" enjoyed 21 straight weeks at the top of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/top-netflix-streaming-shows-this-week-the-crown-the-mandalorian-2019-11">Parrot Analytics' weekly list</a> of the most in-demand original streaming shows in the US, but "The Mandalorian" has surpassed it. Parrot Analytics measures "demand expressions," the company's standardized TV-demand measurement unit designed to reflect the desire, engagement, and viewership of a series weighted by importance.</p>
      <p>"The Mandalorian" had over 100 million demand expressions during the week of November 17 to November 23, according to Parrot Analytics, while "Stranger Things" had 81 million.</p>
      <p>Parrot Analytics data last week showed "The Mandalorian" surging toward the top of its list. It was already <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus-mandalorian-one-of-biggest-streaming-shows-of-year-2019-11">the most in-demand new original streaming series of the year</a> one week after its release, topping Netflix's "The Umbrella Academy" and "When They See Us."</p>
      <p>"While demand is a metric that should not be confused with subscriber numbers, this is a strong indication that the 'Star Wars' series is driving a lot of sign-ups to the recently-debuted <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?subId1=newsroom_affiliate_112519_mandalorian-beats-stranger-things&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F">Disney Plus</a> service," a Parrot Analytics representative said.</p>
      <p>Disney said <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus-has-10-million-sign-ups-since-launch-subscribers-2019-11">the service had 10 million sign-ups</a> a day after launching.</p>
      <p>"The Mandalorian" isn't just a hit with audiences â€” it has a 90% Rotten Tomatoes critic score after three episodes. Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-mandalorian-is-an-old-school-worthy-star-wars-series-2019-11">said in its review of the first episode</a> that the series "proves 'Star Wars' can make the leap from movies to prestige TV."</p>
