      <p>The move from the Jammu and Kashmir administration is seen as a humanitarian step towards restoring peace and normalcy in the UT. The two leaders were under detention since August 5 when the Centre revoked Article 370 that accorded special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
      <p>According to official update, the other two leaders – Dilawar Mir, and Ghulam Hassan Mir, who were under detention for over 110 days, were released by the new union territory administration.</p>
      <p>Among the other 34 political leaders, Mir and Yaseen were earlier lodged at the MLA hostel after being shifted from Centaur hotel in Srinagar.</p>
      <p>On November 15, PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti was shifted to Government Quarters in Srinagar from Chashma Shahi hut.</p>
      <p>The move to shift Mehbooba to Government Quarters came after her daughter had on November 5 wrote a letter to the UT administration, urging them to shift her mother to a warmer place. She wrote the letter in view of the approaching winter.</p>
      <p>The move to shift these political leaders comes a month after the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir became a separate Union Territory.</p>
