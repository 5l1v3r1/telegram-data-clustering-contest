      <p>Pokemon Sword and Shield are quite generous with the number of gift Pokemon you can receive in the game. You can get a <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/pokemon-sword-and-shield-where-to-get-a-free-toxel">free Toxel</a> as well as <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/pokemon-sword-and-shield-where-to-get-a-free-pikachu-eevee">free Pikachu/Eevee</a>. Moreover, you can also get everyone's favourite Generation 1 starter Pokemon, Charmander, as a gift.</p>
      <p>In order to get your free Charmander in Sword and Shield, you will need to have finished the Pokemon League and defeated Leon in battle. Once you've done that, go back to your home town of Postwick and head over to Leon's/Hop's house a few steps away from yours.</p>

      <p>Go inside and head to the top floor to Leon's room. You'll find a Pokeball there and a letter attached from Leon. The Pokeball contains a Level 5 Charmander which you will need to take care of after having beaten Leon in an intense battle.</p>
      <p>Charmander, Charmeleon and Charizard are currently the only Kanto starters available in the game but a <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/pokemon-sword-and-shield-data-mine-reveals-35-new-pokemon-added">surprising leak</a> revealed that at a later point you could also get Squirtle, Bulbasaur and other missing Pokemon.</p>
      <p>Although you do get Charmander a little late in the game, there are several other Pokemon that are <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/pokemon-shield-10-pokemon-worth-adding-to-your-party">worth adding to your party</a> while you wait.</p>
