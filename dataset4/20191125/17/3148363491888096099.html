      <h1>Thanksgiving Dinner Costs Fall to Lowest Level in a Decade | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>Thanksgiving is set to gobble up a smaller part of the family budget this year.</h2>

      <p>The cost of a traditional Thanksgiving feast for 10 will be $48.91, according to the American Farm Bureau’s annual survey of classic items found on the Thanksgiving Day dinner table. That’s up just one penny from last year’s average of $48.90.</p>
      <p>“The average cost of this year’s Thanksgiving dinner is essentially unchanged from last year, after three years of decline since 2015,” said AFBF Chief Economist Dr. John Newton.</p>
      <p>Adjusted for inflation, however, the cost of Thanksgiving is actually down to $19.13, the lowest level in more than a decade.</p>

      <p>The price of Turkey is down 4 percent from last year, at $20.80 for a 16-pound bird. That’s the lowest since 2010.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Farm Bureau’s informal survey looks at prices of turkey, stuffing, sweet potatoes, rolls with butter, peas, cranberries, a veggie tray, pumpkin pie with whipped cream, and coffee and milk, all in quantities sufficient to serve a family of 10 with plenty for leftovers. Rises in the prices of dinner rolls, sweet potatoes, and milk somewhat offset the decline in the price of Turkey.</p>
      <p>Pumpkin pie and stuffing both showed price declines.</p>
      <p>“While the broader economic message is that food inflation remains tame, the more important take-away is that the upcoming holiday gives us an opportunity to reflect and give thanks,” C.J. Lawrence portfolio adviser Terry Gardner said in a note to clients on Monday.</p>
