      <p>“Nah. Be honest at least. That opening was terrible. Even her singing off key while singing off key didn’t hit like it was supposed to. She coulda done better. But oh well,” one user lamented.</p>
      <p>Many of Gomez’s fans, however, were quick to jump to her defense and blame the audio production as well as the singer's nerves.</p>
