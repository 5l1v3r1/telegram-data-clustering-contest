      <p><b>Madrid:</b> Spanish police are studying how to refloat a submarine believed to be carrying tonnes of cocaine, which if confirmed would make it the first time such a vessel has been found to be used in drug trafficking in the country.</p>
      <p>The submarine was intercepted on Sunday in an inlet in the north-western Spanish region of Galicia, according to an official from the government's office in the province of Pontevedra.</p>
      <p>Galician inlets have long been used by smugglers bringing cocaine by sea from South America into Europe.</p>
      <p>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with government rules, said a police diver had managed to enter the submarine and extracted one package of cocaine.</p>
      <p>Media reports said the vessel - believed to be some 20 metres long - could be carrying three metric tonnes but the official said this could not be confirmed yet.</p>
      <p>He said two Ecuadorian crew members were arrested on land on Sunday after police moved to seize the submarine while a third managed to flee.</p>
      <p>He said it was not clear if the vessel had been purposely sunk by the crew or had suffered some mechanical problem.</p>
      <p>The official said the submarine was some six metres under water and that bad weather was complicating how police might be able to bring it to the surface.</p>
      <p>He said Spanish police, in coordination with other countries' forces, had been monitoring the submarine's journey for some days.</p>
      <p>Portuguese police confirmed the submarine passed by Portugal and that detectives and the Portuguese Navy were involved in a joint operation with Spanish authorities to track it.</p>

      <p>However, a police spokesperson said Portuguese authorities were not immediately making public any details of the operation. The spokesperson spoke on condition of anonymity, in accordance with police rules.</p>
      <p>The Spanish official could not say from which country the submarine had come but media reports said it was suspected to have set off from Colombia.</p>
      <p>Besides Galicia's inlets, gangs often use Spain's south-western port of Algeciras to smuggle cocaine into Spain. In April 2018, police found nearly nine tonnes of cocaine concealed in a banana shipment from Colombia in the port. Two months earlier, authorities seized six tonnes of cocaine there.</p>
