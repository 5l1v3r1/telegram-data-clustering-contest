      <h1>Gripes about Christmas switch on in daylight</h1>
      <h2>Provost Helen Moonie attended the event</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:12:07+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:12</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Hilley, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sarah-hilley/</a></address>
      <p>A Christmas lights event faces a complaint about the big switch-on taking place in broad daylight.</p>
      <p>The illumination at  Troon’s popular Wintertainment took place at 4pm on November 17.</p>
      <p>Crowds flocked to the action-packed community event, which saw Provost Helen Moonie turning on the lights. </p>
      <p>But businesswoman Donna Reid has written to organisers Troon Community Council asking for the light up not to take place so early next year. </p>
      <p>It is believed the spectacle would have a much bigger impact during darkness. </p>
      <p>Troon Community Council chair Helen Duff said the matter would be discussed at the next meeting.</p>
      <p>After doing the honours at the Troon festivities, Provost Moonie dashed to turn on Ayr's lights at 5pm. </p>
      <p>A South Ayrshire council spokesman said: “"The Provost and Depute Provost are always delighted to be asked to attend switch on events at this time of year and appreciate the crowds that always come out. The civic office was contacted by the organisers of Troon Wintertainment to ask if the Provost could switch on their lights at 4pm on 17 November and this was agreed. </p>
      <p>He continued: “The Provost was then asked to attend the switch on event in Ayr also on 17 November at 5pm. The organisers of Troon Wintertainment then requested the Provost attend at the later time of 4:30pm but this was not possible due to the commitment to be in Ayr. The Troon organisers still wanted Provost to attend so stuck with 4pm as previously agreed. "</p>
      <p>Wintertainment featured a parade led by the 1st Troon BB band and other displays including the light up of the beacon.</p>
