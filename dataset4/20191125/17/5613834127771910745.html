      <h1>‘Pumpkinhead’ Remake Still Being Planned With “Exciting News” Coming Soon, Producer Teases</h1>

      <p>As you may recall, it was reported back in 2016 that<i> Saw</i> producer<b> Peter Block</b> was behind a remake of 1988’s Stan Winston-directed creature classic<b><i> Pumpkinhead</i></b>, the first in a four-film franchise that has only continued in the world of comics in recent years. What’s the latest on that project? Speaking with <a href="https://www.rue-morgue.com/exclusive-interview-producer-peter-block-on-the-shed-and-the-pumpkinhead-remake/">Rue Morgue</a>, Block suggests exciting news is coming soon.</p>
      <p>“<b><i>We have some exciting news that I’m not allowed to share yet, but that should be making its way out soon</i></b>,” Block told Rue Morgue’s Michael Gingold last week.</p>
      <p>He continued, “<i>Pumpkinhead is a movie I just love… and while the original Pumpkinhead is a great movie, <b>I think that there is more that can be done with that idea</b>. Sometimes I loathe remakes and reboots because I don’t see the reason for them, but Pumpkinhead is one of those where I believe that the story and the themes of it are so good, but there’s also a way of updating it where less focus on the creature in the beginning will add to a lot of the suspense</i>.”</p>
      <p>Lance Henriksen starred in the original film as Ed Harley, a grieving father who conjures up the titular monster in an effort to kill those who took his young son from him.</p>
      <p>In the wake of the original film, the <i>Pumpkinhead</i> franchise only managed to spawn sequels that went direct to video/television, which means we’ve been waiting for the vengeance demon’s return to the big screen for over 30 years now. While you continue waiting, be sure to check out the recent <a href="https://www.dynamite.com/htmlfiles/search2.html?0=19&amp;next0=&amp;KMPZ=pumpkinhead">five-issue comic series from Dynamite Entertainment and Cullen Bunn</a>.</p>
