      <h1>Parking scheme plans for 'long-suffering' residents of village described as 'giant daytime car park'</h1>
      <h2>There are concerns over the number of tram commuters using the area to park.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:04:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:04</time> by <a rel="author">Oliver Pridmore, Phoebe Ram</a></address>
      <p>Plans for a proposed parking scheme in Wilford to help tackle congestion on its roads are to be put forward to villagers.</p>
      <p>Concerns have been raised around the number of motorists who are parking their cars on roads in the village before <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/transport">commuting</a> into the city centre using public transport.</p>
      <p>Conservative <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-city-council">councillor</a> for Clifton West, Roger Steel, who lives in and represents Wilford described the area as a "giant daytime car park".</p>
      <p>"The tram stop is the main issue in my opinion," he said.</p>
      <p>"When the tram was installed, a car park was added near to the Ferry Inn pub on Main Road after parking spaces at the rugby club and Ironmongers Pond were lost.</p>
      <p>"It was never intended to be for commuters living outside the village to park all day for free and go into the city. That's what the park and ride (in Clifton) is for.</p>
      <p>"We are proposing a permit scheme for residents or potentially restrictions to current car parks, to alleviate our long suffering residents who often have nowhere to park."</p>

      <p>Councillor Steel said when the car park near the tram stop becomes full, it often overflows into the Ferry Inn car park - which is for customers only - and then onto residential streets.</p>
      <p>"The whole village needs a review of what can be done from the Ferry Inn right to the far end of Wilford Lane," he said.</p>
      <p>A survey will be sent out by the ward councillors for residents to give their feedback on what they would like to see done to address parking.</p>
      <p>Ideas include permits for residents to allow up to three cars per household, including one for visitors.</p>
      <p>Another is to add a time limit to car parks rather than charging a fee, to deter people from leaving their cars for long periods of time.</p>
      <p>Similar measures have been placed in areas in nearby Clifton which councillor Steel said has "displaced" traffic into Wilford.</p>

      <p>Councillor Steel also raised concerns about the additional congestion caused during peak school-run times around South Wilford Primary and St Patrick's Voluntary Catholic Academy.</p>
      <p>"Wilford Village is effectively a large cul-de-sac in that there is the same way in and out for drivers on the school run," he said.</p>
      <p>"And with the planned expansion of South Wilford Primary School there will be more.</p>
      <p>"There is a turning circle along Main Road, but many drivers are attempting three-point-turns on a busy, narrow road.</p>
      <p>"Residents are proud of their local schools and don't want to prevent progress but it does create congestion.</p>
      <p>"We will try to address this with double yellow lines at pinch points but reducing parked cars would help.</p>
      <p>"It's also worrying that emergency services may struggle to access these roads."</p>

      <p>In response to the plans, Colin Goddard, 62, said: “This parking scheme would definitely be a good idea.</p>
      <p>“What happens is that people park in the tram car park but that fills very quickly, so then they just park in the pub’s car park.</p>
      <p>“The pub did try a scheme where they’d only let customers use their car park but it hasn’t worked because people just ignore the signs and so I think they’ve practically given up.</p>
      <p>“Having a scheme where residents have a permit is sorely needed.”</p>
      <p>Steve Edmonds, 52, said: “You get punters coming here to use the tram car park but there’s no limit so people can stay all day - so it’s usually rammed by the afternoon.</p>
      <p>“I’m lucky because I’ve got a bit of driveway space but others have got street only parking - which is a nightmare for them.</p>
      <p>“There’s two schools near here as well so the school run in a morning and afternoon is absolute carnage.</p>
      <p>“I just imagine if an ambulance was called here and couldn’t get down the road - which with the amount of congestion could definitely happen.</p>
      <p>“A resident permit scheme is a great idea and I certainly wouldn’t mind paying for it.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Nottingham City Council confirmed the car park near the tram stop was built by the council after spaces were lost during the tram installation.</p>
      <p>Any changes to parking including schemes or restrictions would need to be covered by the budgets of the local ward councillors.</p>
      <p>Tram provider Nottingham Express Transit (NET) were approached about parking concerns but declined to comment.</p>
