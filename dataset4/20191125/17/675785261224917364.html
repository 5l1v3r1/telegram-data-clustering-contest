      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:01:21+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:01</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United have been told they need "five or six signings" to turn things around in January by former player Gary Neville.</p>
      <p>Neville watched on in frustration in his role as co-commentator on Sky Sports as United drew 3-3 with Sheffield United in a frantic Bramall Lane encounter on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side came from 2-0 down to take a 3-2 lead only to concede a late equaliser, leaving them ninth in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>And he outlined the need for a number of signings in order to strengthen their side to a sufficient level to climb up the table - pinpointing three specific positions which need urgent attention.</p>
      <p>“They need a striker, they need two midfield players, they need a left-back – they need five or six signings," Neville said.</p>

      <p>“They can’t do that until January and obviously the summer but the midfield will not go away as a problem for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> just because of an injury.</p>
      <p>“It’s a problem full stop – it needs strengthening.”</p>
      <p>Whilst Neville sees improvement needed in plenty of areas, he highlighted central midfield as the biggest cause for concern.</p>
      <p>“The midfield’s just a problem for United full stop, let’s be clear about it,” he said.</p>

      <p>“Even with Scott McTominay in it’s a problem. They haven’t strengthened in that area, obviously Pogba’s injured.</p>
      <p>“It’s a problem for them and it’s just not good enough, the midfield just doesn’t have good enough quality.”</p>
      <p>Injuries have played a part, but Fred and Andreas Pereira have struggled to make an impact as stand-ins for McTominay and Pogba.</p>
      <p>A host of players have been linked with the Red Devils in January, including midfielders such as Sean Longstaff, Declan Rice, James Maddison, Nicolo Zaniolo and Eduardo Camavinga amongst others.</p>
      <p>Strikers including Erling Braut Haaland, Mario Mandzukic, Moussa Dembele and Timo Werner have also been linked ahead of their latest transfer window.</p>
