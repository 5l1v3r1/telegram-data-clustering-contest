      <p>A schoolgirl was killed at a pedestrian crossing after a motorist ran a red light, a court has been told.</p>
      <p>Kieran Kennedy had been driving his Volkswagen Sirocco on the outside lane at Kingsway, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride</a> , Lanarkshire, when he struck 15-year-old <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/megan-whole-world-heartbroken-family-11400886">Megan Scott</a> . The court was told the fatal incident took place one second after the traffic lights changed from amber to red.</p>
      <p>Kennedy, 20, from Chapelton, Lanarkshire, appeared at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">High Court</a> in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> on Monday where he denies causing death by dangerous driving.</p>
      <p>Gavin Malloy, a traffic cop with 17 years service with the force, told the court that he was at the scene within minutes.</p>
      <p>When asked about the condition of the vehicle, he said: “It was <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/car-crashes">collision</a> damaged. The front light unit was smashed, there was a dent on the bonnet and the windscreen was smashed.”</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland">Police Scotland</a> constable was able to collect CCTV footage of the incident from buses, an ambulance, a nearby McDonald’s and a Premier Inn.</p>
      <p>Video footage was shown to the jury of the incident which took place on the A749 at 5.46pm on October 18, 2017.</p>
      <p>Constable Malloy said: “The light was red when he went through the traffic light. A pedestrian comes into view and is struck on the crossing."</p>
      <p>He was then asked by prosecutor Chris McKenna: “Did he brake when the lights were at amber,” and the police officer replied: “No.”</p>
      <p>Defence QC John Scullion asked Constable Malloy if Megan appeared to be holding something to the right hand side of her face and he said: “It appears to be a mobile phone.”</p>

      <p>Mr Scullion then asked: “The car driven by Kieran Kennedy struck Megan Scott one second after the lights changed from amber to red is that correct,” and he said: “Yes.”</p>
      <p>The QC said: "Megan Scott does not appear to look right or react in any way to cars travelling in lane two,” and Constable Malloy said: “No.”</p>
      <p>Mr Scullion went on: “At the point when she was struck by the car the light for pedestrians was still at red,” and the policeman replied: “Yes.”</p>
      <p>The defence QC then said: “The light for pedestrians changed to green around five seconds after she entered the roadway and four seconds after she had been hit by the car,” and Constable Malloy replied: “Yes.”</p>
      <p>Mr Scullion added: “The CCTV footage shows that the brake lights on the Volkswagen went on when the lights turned to red and one second later his car collided with Megan Scott causing her death,” and the police officer replied: “Yes.”</p>

      <p>Constable Malloy agreed with the defence QC that because Megan appeared to be on her phone her view of traffic coming from the right might potentially have been blocked.</p>
      <p>A woman motorist later told the jury she saw a young girl thrown into the air when she was hit by the car at the crossing.</p>
      <p>Karen Hurton, 52, said she was sitting in the inside lane in stationary traffic at the pedestrian crossing at the Kingsway. </p>
      <p>She told the court a girl crossed the road in front of her. She told prosecutor Chris McKenna: "The girl began to cross the road. She was on her phone."</p>
      <p>Mrs Hutton claimed the lights were at red and added: "She was thrown in the air forwards. She hit a bus and dropped to the ground.</p>
      <p>"I saw the car as the girl passed me. It came up the outside lane and hit her."</p>
