      <h1>Apple Releases Annual Holiday Video ‘The Surprise’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:39:47+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macstories.net/author/johnvoorhees/" target="_blank">John Voorhees</a></address>
      <p>It’s become a tradition for Apple to release a special holiday season video each year, and this year is no different. Today, the company revealed the 2019 version entitled ‘<a href="https://youtu.be/LDeRyyDrS40">The Surprise</a>.’</p>
      <p>The storyline follows a family as they visit the mother’s father. The video chronicle’s the family’s journey and visit with their two young children. To appease the kids when they fight or get in the way, their parents hand them an iPad to watch movies and play games. However, the children’s use of the iPad evolves over the course of the video, which reveals they’ve used it to create an interactive story about their family and their grandfather’s wife who had passed away.</p>

      <p>It’s a touching video packed with emotion that does an excellent job of showing off the kind of creative projects that are possible with an iPad and pulls it off without being overbearing. The video reminds me a lot of the Emmy award-winning video called ‘<a href="https://youtu.be/Og637tBf91s">Misunderstood</a>’ from the 2013 holiday season.</p>
