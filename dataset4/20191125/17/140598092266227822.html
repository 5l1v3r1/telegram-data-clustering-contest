      <h1>Best Amazon Black Friday 2019 deals: today's top offers in the sales, including 50 PC off Bang &amp; Olufsen headphones</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:53:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/katie-russell/" target="_blank">Katie Russell</a></address>
      <p>It should come as no surprise that Amazon launched its <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/2019/11/25/black-friday-2019-deals-date-do-uk-sales-start-find-best-available/">Black Friday 2019</a> deals a week before most retailers. Starting from last Friday, Amazon has been offering some of the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/2019/11/25/best-black-friday-2019-deals-early-sales-discounts-amazon-currys/">best Black Friday deals</a> on televisions, laptops, headphones and more. Today there are brand-new deals available on X, Y and Z.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/how-black-friday-name-what-meaning-history-called-sales-event/">the retailer that brought the November sales to the UK from the States</a>, Amazon goes all-out on Black Friday. Last year alone, customers saved over £40 million in Amazon's Black Friday sales, and this year should be no different. </p>
      <p>Amazon is not alone in starting its Black Friday sales before the official sales date (this Friday, November 29). <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/2019/11/25/john-lewis-black-friday-2019-best-deals-today/">John Lewis</a> and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/currys-pc-world-black-friday-2019-best-deals-early-sale/">Currys PC World</a> also launched their offers last Friday. Yet Amazon has a slight advantage because, on top of selling <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/predictions-best-black-friday-cyber-monday-tech-deals2/">electricals and gadgets</a> at a discounted price, the retailer also has Amazon-branded products (Echo Dots, Fire tablets, etc) in its sales.</p>
      <p>For more details, please see below for our round-up of the best Amazon Black Friday 2019 deals on offer today. </p>

Elsewhere, the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bang-Olufsen-Beoplay-Wireless-Headphones-Charcoal-Grey/dp/B01N6S83CL?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">Bang &amp; Olufsen Beoplay H4 Wireless Headphones (1st Generation)</a> are half price - at £124.99, down from £250. </p>

      <p>These wireless headphones certainly look the part, in a unique shade of pastel blue. But there's more to them than meets the eye. The Beats Studio3 headphones are noise-cancelling and have up to 22 hours of battery life. Reviewers have said these headphones are comfortable and convenient, and that it's easy to take a phone call while wearing them. Some said that, at the previous £299 price tag, they were not great value for money - but now that Amazon is offering them at a 34 per cent discount, this should be less of an issue. Elsewhere on the site, there is up to 40 per cent off headphones from Sony, Bose, Sennheiser and more. </p>

      <p>As part of Amazon's Black Friday deals, the Huawei P30 model is being heavily discounted across the site. This model, with its high-quality OLED screen and supreme picture quality (it has a triple camera), is being sold at 38 per cent off from its original retailing price.</p>

      </p>
      <p>This relatively new iPhone model is a surprise entrant for Amazon's Black Friday deals. The XS has a great quality camera, incorporating Portrait mode (where the camera focuses on the person and blurs the background, making your friend's face look sharper), Portrait lightning,  depth control (where you can adjust the background blur) and Smart HDR (a professional camera technique that creates super high quality photos). While the camera is the star feature, there's also a 5.8-inch screen - ideal for catching up on your favourite shows on the commute - and the phone is water resistant. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Don't underestimate the Samsung A8. Sure, it may be constantly outshone by the shinier, newer Samsung Galaxy range (the S10+ being a particular favourite), but the A8 has a few tricks up its sleeve. For starters, it has a decent camera, which can blur the background and bring your face into sharper focus. It also unlocks using facial recognition, and is a well-equipped smartphone. Its main USP, according to reviewers, is its value for money. Now, coming in a bundle with a wireless Bluetooth speaker, this is definitely the case. You'll have to be quick, however, as the deal expires tonight before midnight.</p>

      <p>This is the newest Fire tablet from Amazon, and is up to 30 per cent faster than the previous models. It has 10 hours' battery and a 10.1" screen, so you can watch movies with ease on your commute. Plus, you can expect high quality picture definition, due to its 1080p Full HD display.</p>
      <p>The older models are also in the sale, and the Fire HD 8 is fairly similar to the new model (but with a smaller screen) so it may be worth investing there instead. The best Fire HD deals in the Amazon Black Friday sales: </p>

      <p>The 10.5-inch iPad Pro may not be as swish as the newer 11-inch or 12.9-inch models, but it still receives rave reviews for its functionality - you can easily watch movies or catch up on your favourite shows on your commute, plus it has a fast loading time, 10 hours of battery life and is easy to use. As it is a slightly older model, there is an impressive 49 per cent discount being offered - which is generous for such a pragmatic model. </p>
      <p>If you want the kit with all the bells and whistles, however, there is a £200 discount on the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07K576Q5X/ref=uk_a_ipad_1?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">11-inch iPad Pro</a> (now £719) and on the new <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07KM5RYMN?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">12.9-inch</a> (now £1,518.99). The new model has a larger screen, uses Face ID and has a slightly better front camera, but it otherwise similar to the original model.  </p>

      <p>The new Kindle Oasis has more high-end features that its contemporaries.

Particularly ideal for cosying up by the fire with a good book. </p>

      <p>Lightweight, quick and with a slick aesthetic, this model from ASUS is excellent value for money. It has a fairly large 13.3-inch screen (a matter of personal preference) yet is smaller than a piece of A4 paper. If this lightweight runaround doesn't tickle your fancy, Amazon is offering up to 25 per cent off other models, including the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Microsoft-Surface-12-3-Tablet-Platinum/dp/B07Y5M67K7/ref=sr_1_4?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">Microsoft Surface Pro 7</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/HP-Chromebook-11-v001na-11-5-Inch-Laptop/dp/B01LYBTFZZ/ref=sr_1_3?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">HP Chromebook 11</a>, and offerings from Acer and Dell. </p>
