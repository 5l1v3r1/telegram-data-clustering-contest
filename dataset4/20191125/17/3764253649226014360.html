        <i>“The requirements of our people, whatever religion they follow, and to whatever ethnic group they belong in Nigeria is the same.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>‘‘They need security, education and participation in an inclusive economy. On this, we are being very fair to all Nigerians,”</i> he said.</p>
      <p>The Nigerian leader welcomed the prayers of the religious group for his wellbeing and for the peace and progress in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>He urged them to convey his best wishes to President Macky Sall of Senegal, saying: “<i> I assure you that I am very close to your president. He addresses me as ‘Baba’’.</i></p>
