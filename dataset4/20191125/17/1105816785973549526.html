      <h1>IHC to take up plea against PM Imran's speech</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:12:15+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/7761/news-2/" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday fixed for hearing a petition against a controversial speech of Prime Minister Imran Khan regarding the judiciary, seeking contempt of court proceedings against the premier.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Express News</i>, the petitioner, Advocate Samiullah, took the stance that the speech of the prime minister on November 18 fell under the purview of contempt of court, alleging that the prime minister tried to scandalise the judiciary.</p>
      <p>The petitioner had affixed relevant portion of the speech with his petition.</p>
      <p>IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah will hear the petition on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>A similar petition was filed in the Lahore High Court by a citizen, Tahir Maqsood, praying the court that contempt proceedings be initiated against the prime minister.</p>
      <p>The petitioner, through his counsel advocate Faizan Naseer Chohan, contended that the prime minister tried to make cases pending against opposition leaders prejudiced by delivering a speech.</p>
      <p>To establish maintainability of his petition, the petitioner referred to conviction of PML-N leaders Talal Chaudhry and Nehal Hashmi by the apex court for their anti-judiciary speeches.</p>
      <p>He asked the court to summon PM Imran in person, disqualify him and order the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to de-notify him as member of the National Assembly.</p>
      <p>PM Imran, while addressing the inaugural ceremony of Havelian-Mansehra section of the Hazara motorway at Havelian last week, had asked Chief Justice of Pakistan Asif Saeed Khosa and senior judge of the Supreme Court Justice Gulzar Ahmed to come forward and restore public confidence in the judiciary.</p>
