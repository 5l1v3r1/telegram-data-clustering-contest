      <p>The 30-year-old, who left Lancashire at the end of the 2018 season, will bring a wealth of experience to the county.</p>
      <p>Kerrigan has played more than 100 First Class matches, taking 322 wickets, while he has also appeared in 35 List A matches and 24 Twenty20 matches.</p>
      <p>His career-best figures of 9-51 came against Hampshire in the penultimate game of the 2011 season, which ended with Lancashire crowned county champions.</p>
      <p>The consistent performances of Preston-born Kerrigan led to him being called up by England to play in the final match of the 2013 Ashes against Australia at The Oval.</p>
      <p>Kerrigan, who had a spell on loan to Northamptonshire in 2017, joins Shropshire following a successful season with Fulwood and Broughton CC in the Northern Premier Cricket League.</p>
      <p>He took 67 league wickets at 9.03 apiece while he also contributed just under 400 league runs with the bat, scoring two centuries, one in the league, the other in a cup match.</p>
      <p>Now he’s looking forward to the next stage of his career with Shropshire.</p>
      <p>“Since I left Lancashire, Minor Counties has definitely been something that's interested me,” said Kerrigan. “It's still an opportunity to play at a good standard of cricket and get a lot of overs in, compared to just playing club cricket at the weekend.”</p>
      <p>He revealed that Karl Krikken, Shropshire’s former director of cricket and a man he has known for a long time, played a part in him joining the county.</p>
      <p>“He put me in touch with the club,” he said. "We quickly got things done and dusted and I’m really looking forward to it.”</p>
      <p>Kerrigan, who also represented England Lions earlier in his career, added: “I’m looking forward to working with the lads.</p>
      <p>"There’s quite a few training sessions over the winter, so I’m going to make as many of them as I can, get to know the lads and them get to know me. Hopefully we can build towards something in the summer and be successful.”</p>
      <p>And he’s keen to pass on his experience to the younger members of the Shropshire squad.</p>
      <p>“I’m a bit of a cricket badger,” he insisted. "I’m really keen to keep advancing my coaching.</p>
      <p>"I’ve got my Level 3 coaching badge and in my last year at Lancashire I did a lot of coaching with the Lancashire second team and the Lancashire age groups. Even in the years before that, I worked a lot with the young spinners coming through.</p>
      <p>“It’s something definitely I’m keen to get stuck into, playing and whether you would call it a coach or a mentor role, I think I've got quite a lot of experience in the First Class game, so I’ve got some things that I can pass on to the younger lads.”</p>
      <p>While he’s renowned for his bowling, Kerrigan is also looking to weigh in with the bat for Shropshire.</p>
      <p>“I played a couple of games for Northamptonshire's second team last year and in one of them I got 81 batting at six,” he said. "I’ll be hoping I can fit in somewhere around a similar position for Shropshire and hopefully I can get some runs.</p>
      <p>“I’m not really known for my runs but I do feel in recent years, especially towards the back end of my time with Lancashire and when I went on loan to Northants to play some County Championship cricket, I started to contribute more and more regularly with the bat.”</p>
      <p>As for his hopes moving forward with Shropshire, Kerrigan added: “It seems that it was a bit of a tough year last season.</p>
      <p>"There’s a lot of work going on behind the scenes to try and get the performances on the pitch going the way that everyone wants them to. Hopefully I can be part of turning things around and be part of a successful side.”</p>
      <p>Shropshire are delighted to have recruited Kerrigan as they put plans in place for the new season in the newly-named National Counties Cricket Association.</p>
      <p>Shropshire secretary Richard Lees said: “We are very pleased that we will have Simon’s services for all formats of the game during the coming season.</p>
      <p>“Simon has a great pedigree as a left-arm spin bowler and is a very capable batsman as well. He will also be involved on the coaching side.”</p>
      <p>Vice-chairman John Hulme added: “Simon’s figures over the last two seasons, added to his impressive first-class record, show him to be an excellent all-rounder.</p>
      <p>"He has scored more than 1,800 runs and taken over 90 wickets in club cricket in the last two years, while he also comes highly recommended by a number of people in the first-class game.</p>
      <p>"We are delighted to have him on board and he will have an important role to play in taking the club forward next season.”</p>
