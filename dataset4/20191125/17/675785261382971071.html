      <p>A man reportedly lay dead in a McDonald's toilet for more than a day without anyone noticing despite the facilities being cleaned numerous times.</p>
      <p>The unnamed 48-year-old man dropped into the restaurant on his lunch break at around 12pm in Neu-Anspach, a town in the Hochtaunuskreis in Hesse, Germany.</p>
      <p>The man was working on servicing the vacuum cleaners at a petrol station opposite the McDonald's branch when he went on a lunch break, according to local media reports,</p>
      <p>The following day his boss called the petrol station to ask if they had seen his employee.</p>
      <p>The petrol station worker said he had not arrived there, but his car was still parked out front.</p>
      <p>The boss then asked workers at the Mcdonald's opposite if they knew where his employee was.</p>

      <p>They looked at the fast-food chain's CCTV and confirmed the man entered the eatery to go to the toilet, but had not returned.</p>
      <p>The following day at around 9am the petrol station worker went to the McDonald's and called the vacuum service man's number.</p>
      <p>The phone could be heard ringing behind the cubicle door, but went unanswered.</p>
      <p>Police were called to the scene and an officer reported: "We are not sure exactly how long the man was lying in the cubicle.</p>
      <p>"Witnesses are reporting it was quite a long time."</p>
      <p>The cause of death is unknown and a post-mortem has been ordered.</p>

      <p>A spokesman for the McDonald's chain said: "McDonald's and its franchisers have strict internal and external hygiene regulations and these are often checked.</p>
      <p>"The restaurant in question is run by an independent franchiser. He told us that the toilets had been checked as is routine numerous times on the day in question.</p>
      <p>"It is often the case that we do not talk to people in cubicles to protect their privacy. We are very sorry to hear about the death in one of our restaurants."</p>
      <p>The police investigation is continuing as is standard procedure for unexplained deaths.</p>
