      <p>A mum gave birth to conjoined twins with two heads and three hands.</p>
      <p>Babita Ahirwar, 21, had the delivery by caesarean section at a hospital in India on November 23.</p>
      <p>According to medics the twins share a heart, but have a separate head.</p>
      <p>The infant's third hand had two palms attached to it.</p>
      <p>The new mum and her husband of 18 months Jaswant Ahirwar said they initially thought they were the parents of twins.</p>

      <p>Babita told a news agency: "It was a mixed feeling when the nurses handed over the baby to me.</p>
      <p>"Initially, I thought it was a twin, but when the nurses removed the towel, I was shocked to see our firstborn with two heads and three hands."</p>
      <p>Conjoined twins with two heads, one body and three arms are known as tribrachius parapagus.</p>

      <p>They are extremely rare and their survival rate is very low.</p>
      <p>Dr Surendra Sonkar, who delivered the baby at state-run Vidisha Sadar hospital, said: "There is only one heart visible in the newborn.</p>
      <p>"This is a very rare condition and this is the first time.</p>
      <p>"I have come across such a case in my career."</p>

      <p>The baby has since been transferred to Bhopal's Hamidi Medical College and Hospital.</p>
      <p>"We had initially kept the baby in the ICU, but we thought it was better to refer them to a better-equipped facility in Bhopal," Dr Sonkar said.</p>
