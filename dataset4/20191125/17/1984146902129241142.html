      <p>Echoing the sentiments of many of viewers, Phillip Schofield has slammed I'm A Celebrity for being fixed.</p>
      <p>And it's all to do with the ITV show's latest trial which aired live on Sunday night, just after Jacqueline Jossa and Ian Wright's horrific Crevis of Cruelty challenge.</p>
      <p>Most of this year's <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> took part in the live trial, of course hosted by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/ant-dec-1">Ant &amp; Dec</a> , and they had to down gross 'shakes', hunt for stars and have a host of wriggling creepy crawlies dumped on them.</p>
      <p>For every star they won, they would win a roast dinner for a campmate. Earlier they had arranged everyone in order of who would win a meal. After faring well in the early part of the live trial, it was down to Roman and James to try and win the final stars but they struggled to get any of the remaining three.</p>
      <p>This left Ian, Cliff and Andy without a much-needed roast dinner and viewers were quick to vent their anger, saying that the last bit of the trial was "impossible."</p>
      <p>One ranted  "You screwed up with that last trial .. completely unfair and you have royally annoyed your audience tonight! The right thing to do would be to met James and Ronan redo the trial with more time allocated," and another reacted "Last night's trial was impossible for the amount of time they had, I bet the stand ins who did it didn’t have big hands like James. They should be given another chance to earn the stars by giving them longer time, I love the show but last night I felt it was a fix."</p>
      <p>And during Monday's live This Morning broadcast, Phillip agreed with them, saying: "The last one! It's not possible in 90 seconds!"</p>
