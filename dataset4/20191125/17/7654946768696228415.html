      <p>A prosecutor in Texas was arrested for allegedly assaulting his wife during an argument sparked by his infidelity, police said.</p>
      <p>Liberty County District Attorney Logan Pickett, 38, was taken into custody early Saturday at the Westin Houston Downtown after cops said his wife, Megan, told a clerk at the hotel that he pushed her, causing her to hit her head, <a href="https://abc13.com/judge-grants-pre-trial-release-for-liberty-co-district-attorney/5715302/">KTRK reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Megan said she and her husband were attending an event at nearby Minute Maid Park when she learned after dinner late Friday that he had been having an affair for the past 15 months, police said.</p>
      <p>That’s when Logan allegedly pushed his wife, leaving a gash on her head. Medics at the scene said the woman’s wound needed three stitches to be properly closed, but she refused medical attention, according to the station.</p>
      <p>A receptionist at the district attorney’s office said Logan was unavailable to comment early Monday by reached by The Post.</p>
      <p>An attorney representing him, meanwhile, released a statement and said the couple would not be making further comments regarding the incident, which will not immediately impact his position, <a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/2019/11/23/liberty-county-da-arrested-in-houston-for-assault-against-family-member-records-show/">KPRC reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“They will rely on their strong faith in God and confidence in our justice system to carry their family through this most difficult time,” the statement reads. “They trust the process will afford them the same dignity, respect and equality as others who encounter our judicial process.”</p>
      <p>The couple has three children together, according to the station.</p>
      <p>Logan, a Republican first elected in 2012, was charged with assault against a family member and released after posting $1,000 bond. A judge also barred him from threatening or harassing his wife and suspended his concealed handgun license.</p>
      <p>He could be face up to one year in jail or a $4,000 if convicted of the misdemeanor count, <a href="https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Liberty-County-DA-arrested-on-assault-charge-14858955.php">the Houston Chronicle reported</a>.</p>
