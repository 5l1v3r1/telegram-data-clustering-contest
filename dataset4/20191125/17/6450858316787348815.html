      <h1>Best Budget Laptop Deals: Cheap Black Friday Laptops Under £300</h1>
      <h2>There are some amazing Windows laptop and Chromebook deals under £300 if you know where to look. Let us be your guide to the best Black Friday budget laptop deals.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:27:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:27</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Black</a></address>
      <p>This is the best time to buy a cheap laptop, with all manner of retailers pulling some seriously attractive deals out of the bag for <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/internet/black-friday-2019-3661756/">Black Friday 2019</a>.</p>
      <p>Though the main event does not take place until Friday 29 November, many of the larger online retailers have already started their Black Friday sales. But budget laptops do not hang around for long, so if you see a spec you like at a price you like, do not wait or you may miss out.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/laptop/budget-laptop-deals-3778465/#budgetlaptopdeals">Jump straight to budget laptop deals.</a>
      </p>
      <p>We review <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/laptop/best-budget-laptop-3214583/">budget laptops</a> all year round, and our favourite model right now is the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/laptops/hp-250-g7-3701643/">HP 250 G7</a>. You will find that discounted to as little as £289.97 at <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=2690&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3778465-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebuyer.com%2F919599-hp-250-g7-core-i3-4gb-128gb-ssd-1tb-hdd-15-6-win10-8ab96es-abu">eBuyer</a>, but do note that often the way to get down laptop prices is to reduce the spec. This model comes with a Core i3 processor, 4GB of memory and a 128GB solid-state storage drive, whereas the model we reviewed has a Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD (<a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=2690&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3778465-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebuyer.com%2F879510-hp-250-g7-15-6-full-hd-intel-core-i5-laptop-with-windows-6mp21es-abu">also discounted at eBuyer to £397.98</a>).</p>
      <p>For many people that cheaper option is going to be more than enough for their needs, but it goes to show that when buying budget laptops you should be aware of small differences in the spec - and it always helps to have some idea of what to look out for in the first place. This way, if you see a great laptop deal we haven't mentioned here, you'll be able to work out whether or not it's a good buy.</p>
      <p>Key things to look out for are the processor, memory and both type of storage and amount of storage. At under £300 you're unlikely to find anything higher than an Intel Core i3/AMD A-series or Ryzen 3 processor; if you do find a Core i5, snap up that laptop right away.</p>
      <p>You'll also see Intel Pentium and Celeron processors listed, and these are less powerful options often found in older models and Chromebooks/CloudBooks, but still more than capable if your needs are low. By that we mean you're looking for something that's good for homework, replying to emails, browsing the web and social media, and watching the odd video.</p>
      <p>These chips will have integrated graphics, and you should not expect to find a dedicated graphics card at this price. Your laptop will be more than capable of playing YouTube and movies, plus some casual games, but if you're really after something capable of proper gaming we'd recommend upping your budget to £500+ and going for a Core i5 as the bare minimum. <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/laptop/best-laptop-deals-3664664/">We've got some more options on slightly pricier laptop deals here</a>.</p>
      <p>At this price you're most likely to find 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD, although at the budget end of the market you often find solid-state storage is swapped out for a traditional mechanical hard drive. The upside to this is more storage space; the down side is they are slower, a little noisier and more fragile.</p>
      <p>The size of the screen and the overall design of the laptop are going to be purely personal choices. You'll find everything from 11in to 15.6in screens at this price point; a handful with full-HD (1080p) displays but most with HD (720p) screens. Smaller laptops are typically going to be more easily portable, but it's easier to get stuff done on a larger screen, especially if you are wanting to watch video, play casual games or work with spreadsheets.</p>
      <p>Don't overlook <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/laptop/best-chromebooks-2019-3528995/">Chromebooks</a>, with which your children may well be familiar from school. The difference between these and traditional Windows laptops is the software that is installed on them, with Chromebooks instead using Chrome OS. You'll also find CloudBooks, which run Windows 10 S.</p>

      <p>The most expensive of the four Aspire 3 laptops listed here, this one has both a 15.6in full-HD screen and the best processor, the Ryzen 3 (also from AMD).</p>

      </p>
      <p>Cheaper than the 14in version of this same laptop (below), this Ryzen 3 laptop running Windows 10 S offers staggering value for money with a 15.6in full-HD screen under £300.</p>

      </p>
      <p>A fantastic deal on a Windows 10 S laptop under £300, but if portability isn't everything save some money and get a larger screen on the 15.6in full-HD model above. Both have the same core spec with the Ryzen 3-3200U chip, 4GB of RAM and 128GB SSD.</p>
      <h4>8. Lenovo IdeaPad 320 (15.6in HD, Intel Core i3, 4GB RAM, 2TB HDD)</h4>

      </p>
      <p>Though you can find better value for money in the laptops higher up our list (while stocks last), no-one can complain about a 15.6in Windows 10 S laptop with a Core i3 processor at £299.</p>
      <h4>10. Lenovo IdeaPad 330 (15.6in HD, Core i3, 4GB RAM, 1TB HDD)</h4>

      </p>
      <p>A slightly older model than the 250 G7 at #1, but this laptop swaps out the 15.6in HD screen for a full-HD version and costs only £10 more. Both run the Intel Core i3-7020U processor with 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD, along with Windows 10 Home.</p>

      </p>
      <p>This Windows 10 laptop from HP stands out for its 15.6in full-HD display and 1TB of storage, though it's running a slightly slower AMD A6 processor than some models in our round-up. You can still expect capable performance for daily computing tasks.</p>
      <h4>13. HP Stream 14 (14in HD, AMD A4, 4GB RAM, 64GB SSD)</h4>

      </p>
      <p>If you just need a basic laptop without breaking the bank then this is bargain from HP, with a no-frills AMD A4 processor that isn't the fastest you'll find in the budget market but capable for most daily computing tasks. It's got what you need, plus includes a one-year subscription to Office 365 with 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage.</p>
      <h4>14. Lenovo IdeaPad S130 (11.6in HD, Intel Celeron, 4GB RAM, 64GB SDD)</h4>

      </p>
      <p>Need to do basic computing on the go without spending a fortune? The S130 is a great choice at way under £150 and even includes  a 1-year subscription to Office 365 and 1TB of OneDrive storage. Note the slower Intel Celeron processor, however.</p>
      <h4>15. Lenovo IdeaPad S145 (15.6in HD, Intel Pentium, 4GB RAM, 128GB SSD)</h4>

      </p>
      <p>We'd always recommend a Core i3 or AMD A-series processor in a budget laptop, but if your needs are relatively low then the Intel Pentium processor inside this 15.6in laptop enables a price below £200.</p>
      <h4>16. Asus 14in CloudBook with Office 365</h4>
      <figure>

      </p>
      <p>Much like a Chromebook, this CloudBook from Asus has a browser-based operating system that enables it to run on some pretty low-power hardware, hence the cheap price. Note the inclusion of a one-year subscription to Office 365, which could make this an ideal laptop for homework.</p>
      <h4>17. Asus 11in CloudBook with Office 365</h4>
      <figure>

      </p>
      <p>Simply a smaller-screened version of the CloudBook 14, this slightly cheaper Asus model will be more easily portable for younger children.</p>

      <p>Cheaper than Acer's other Chromebooks, this model is also more easily portable with a 14in HD screen. It runs an Intel Celeron chip and has 32GB of solid-state storage, which sounds meagre but should be plenty given that you'll be interacting with its browser-based OS.</p>
