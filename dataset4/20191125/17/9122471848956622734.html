      <h1>Jim Harbaugh Comments On Saturday’s Game vs. Ohio State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:52:43+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Rivalry week is finally here. No. 2 Ohio State and No. 13 Michigan are set to face off this Saturday in Ann Arbor. For the first time in a few seasons, many anticipate a close game this weekend.</p>
      <p>Wolverines head coach Jim Harbaugh certainly seems confident heading into game week. In fact, he’s “excited” for the massive rivalry contest.</p>
      <blockquote>“I’m excited for the game,” Harbaugh said, via <a href="https://twitter.com/BSB_Wolverine/status/1199010987321384963">Brandon Brown of Wolverine Insider</a>. “Up for it and ready for the challenge.”</blockquote>

      <p>Not too many head coaches are excited to face the vaunted Buckeyes. Plenty argue Ohio State deserves the top spot in the College Football Playoff rankings due to OSU’s dominant play this season.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes haven’t skipped a beat with Ryan Day taking over as head coach. But Saturday’s game will be Day’s toughest test yet.</p>
      <p>Harbaugh and the Wolverines are playing like one of the best teams in the nation as of late. Michigan has won four straight and seven of its last eight games. The Wolverines would love nothing more than to upset Ohio State on Saturday and move to 10-2 in the process.</p>
      <p>But OSU QB Justin Fields and RB J.K. Dobbins will be the Wolverines’ toughest defensive challenge to date. Will the Michigan defense have an answer for the QB-RB duo?</p>
      <p>Michigan-Ohio State kicks off this Saturday at noon ET on FOX.</p>
