      <h1>Best Black Friday 2019 deals: Early sales and discounts from Amazon, Currys and John Lewis so far</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:51:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-reporters/" target="_blank">Telegraph Reporters</a></address>
      <p>Even though <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/2019/11/25/black-friday-2019-deals-date-do-uk-sales-start-find-best-available/">Black Friday 2019</a> officially starts this coming Friday, November 29, the retailers have got a jump-start this year. On Friday, exactly a week before the official start date, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/2019/11/25/amazon-black-friday-2019-sales-best-deals-today-uk/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/currys-pc-world-black-friday-2019-best-deals-offers-sale/">Currys PC World</a> and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/2019/11/25/john-lewis-black-friday-2019-best-deals-today/">John Lewis</a> launched their Black Friday deals, and there some are serious savings to be made.</p>
      <p>So far, there are big discounts on TVs, tech, fashion and everything in between. Last year, customers saved £40 million on Amazon alone, and, from looking at the deals that have launched today, it is easy to see why. </p>
      <p>With so many deals already on offer, sale-loving shoppers are truly spoilt for choice this year. But before you start feeling overwhelmed by this choice, we have prepared the following guide on where to find the best Black Friday deals this year.</p>
      <h3>Where can I find the best Black Friday deals - which retailers have offers?</h3>
      <p>It's no surprise that <b>Amazon</b> leads the pack - the retailer started its Black Friday deals last week. Amazon is practically synonymous with Black Friday as it not only brought Black Friday to the UK, but it offers the widest range of deals in the widest range of categories - including <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/best-tv-deals-black-friday-2019-uk-cyber-monday-sales/">TVs</a>, tech, mobile phones, appliances, laptops, tablets, consoles, smart devices and more. </p>
      <p>Both <b>John Lewis </b>and <b>Currys PC World</b> have also started their offers - the stores both price-match many of their competitors' best deals, making Currys an easy one-stop-shop for tech and John Lewis a worthwhile destination for higher-end products.</p>
      <p><b>Argos</b> is another of the big retailers getting in on the act early. The store is a good go-to for smart tech and consoles, and last year's Black Friday sale marked its biggest-ever day for video gaming sales.</p>
      <p>It's also worth keeping an eye on other cross-category retailers, such as <b>Very </b>and <b>AO</b>, which work hard to beat Amazon's prices every year - especially for home appliances. </p>

      <p>This smart speaker uses voice command (Alexa) to play music, answer questions, update you on the day's news and more. It has a sleek pebble-like design that will suit any room, and it's impressive 56 per cent discount makes it particularly good value for money. If you already have a pair of decent speakers, however, Amazon is offering the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Echo-Input-White-audio-input-Bluetooth/dp/B07C7MSKPD?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">Echo Input</a> (which allows any external speaker to become an Alexa-enabled device) at over half price today, at £14.99, down from £34.99.</p>

      <p>This super smooth whisky comes at bargain price today, with Amazon whipping 20% off its retail price. Flavour-wise, Dalwhinnie's 15 Year Old is a crowd pleaser – think delicate spice and smooth honey, with a firm Speyside body. A Christmas gift for all. </p>

      <p>We're surprised that the Echo Show 8 is in the sales, and with such a significant discount, given that it is a brand new model.

      <p>It's the ultimate status symbol, which perhaps explains why it frequently sells out throughout the year.

With a 4.8-litre capacity, and iconic retro design, it is both pragmatic and decorative for your kitchen. For a little extra (£349), you can get the stand mixer in a striking red colour <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fkitchenaid-artisan-4-8l-stand-mixer-candy-apple-red%2Fp4797487%3FsearchTerm%3D%2B85543741%26s_afcid%3Daf_73846%26tmad%3Dc%26awc%3D1203_1574428089_cc8e61a1ae8d7d78aa380e7b2ba070a2%26tmcampid%3D48">from John Lewis</a>.</p>

Like all cordless Dyson products, however, the V8 is lightweight and easy to use - the days of tripping over the lead are over.</p>

Complete with a Dolby Atmos sound system, you can expect a cinematic effect. Even better, this is a smart TV, meaning you can ask the in-built Google Assistant to turn up the volume or change the channel without having to scramble for the remote control. </p>
