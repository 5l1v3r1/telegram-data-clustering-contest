      <p>Preston Magistrates’ Court was told his victim, who is deaf, was pulled so forcefully that she tried to wedge her foot between the bannister and a wall to stop the 33-year-old pulling her any further.</p>

      <p>Prosecuting, Dylan Wagg said the incident had unfolded at around 8.30pm on September 1.</p>
      <p>He said: “The defendant and complainant had been in a relationship for some time.</p>
      <p>“On the night in question there had been an argument which resulted in the offence.</p>
      <p>“The defendant has dragged his partner down a flight of stairs in the block of flats where they lived.”</p>
      <p>CCTV footage, which showed her being assaulted for at least five minutes in the stairwell, was played to the magistrates’ bench.</p>
      <p>He added: “She was dragged violently down the stairs so forcefully that she puts her foot between wall and stairwell to prevent being further pulled but is unable to stop him.</p>
      <p>“The Crown would say this is violent unwanted contact.”</p>
      <p>The court heard the couple had not reconciled.</p>
      <p>Defending, Janice Vallance said the woman did not cooperate with the investigation.</p>
      <p>She told the bench that Lierbenrood had “pulled her hood” during the row, causing her to stumble down a few stairs.</p>
      <p>She added: “He then stands over her and an argument takes place, which is difficult because both parties are deaf.</p>
      <p>“Both have to sign to communicate, and have to be fairly close to each other to do so.</p>
      <p>“After the pulling down the stairs she’s sitting on stairs and two points he grabs her - but he says he hugs her.”</p>
      <p>The bench imposed a rehabilitation activity requirement, with a £30 fine, £90 surcharge and £200 costs.</p>
      <p>He was given a restraining order.</p>
      <p>A second allegation of an assault the following day was dismissed.</p>
