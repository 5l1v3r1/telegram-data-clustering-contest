      <p>A good Samaritan took a dog on a cross-country road trip to reunite him with his dying owner.</p>
      <p>Bailey’s owner was recently diagnosed with a terminal illness and traveled from Minnesota to Washington State to receive treatment and live out her remaining days among friends.</p>
      <p>The owner, who was not named, tried to take Bailey with her, but the dog was not allowed on the plane because of health issues associated with his breed.</p>
      <p>Bailey was not allowed on the plane because he is a pug mix known to have problems breathing the air on planes – which is when Ryan Chukuske stepped in to take Bailey approximately 1,500 miles to be with his owner.</p>
      <p>Chukuske works with Spot’s Last Canine Rescue and his wife, Megan Giesen, began a GoFundMe to help pay for the car rental, fuel, hotels, and flight home, which the Chukuske offered to pay for himself.</p>

      <p>On the <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/bringing-bailey-to-washington?utm_source=customer&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1">GoFundMe page</a>, Giesen wrote that ‘the airlines would not fly Bailey out do to his breed and “smoosh” face.’</p>

      <p>‘Bailey and his owner mean the world to each other. Rather than having them be separated, Ryan is driving Bailey from Minnesota to Washington. Bailey and his owner deserve to be together,’ the post continued.</p>
      <p>Chukuske told <a href="https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2019/11/24/minnesota-man-drives-to-washington-state-to-reunite-dog-with-its-terminally-ill-owner/">WCCO</a> that he ‘didn’t hesitate’ when deciding whether to bring Bailey to his owner, adding that one of his philosophies is to just be good to people.</p>
      <p>‘I just think it was one of those things where everyone deserves good things to happen to them regardless of where you’re at in life, and especially maybe at the end of your life,’ he said.</p>

      <p>‘So if having your dog with you is what is really important to and for you, then I am going to make that happen.’</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Chukuske posted an update on his Facebook saying: ‘I cannot express enough gratitude to all of you for the outpouring of love and support for Bailey’s journey. It was truly my honor and privilege to bring this brave dog to be with his person. Be good to others. Journey on my friends!’</p>
      <p>He has not said whether he has yet finished the journey and reunited Bailey with his owner.</p>
