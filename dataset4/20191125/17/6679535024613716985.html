      <p>JSW Infrastructure has announced the commissioning of its new iron ore terminal at Paradip Port in Odisha.</p>
      <p>The 370 metre-long terminal with a capacity of 18 MTPA has been developed to handle capesize vessels for iron ore and pellet exports and can load at a rate of 100,000 million tonnes per day.</p>
      <p>The high load rate is expected to significantly reduce the pre-berthing delays at Paradip as well as allow incremental cargo flow for the Port which is all set to be the largest port in the country, the company said.</p>
      <p>The company has invested ₹750 crore to set up the new terminal at Paradip.</p>
      <p>Paradip Port Trust had awarded JSW Infrastructure the right to develop a fully mechanised iron ore export terminal on Build, Operate and Transfer basis for 30 years.</p>
      <p>Following the commissioning of this new terminal, JSW Infrastructure’s current cargo capacity crossed the 100 MTPA mark.</p>
      <p>Arun Maheshwari, Joint MD and CEO of JSW Infrastructure said, “Paradip location continues to remain attractive for iron ore movement via the sea route.”</p>
      <p>With the commissioning of this terminal, India can now offer capesize shipments, he said.</p>
