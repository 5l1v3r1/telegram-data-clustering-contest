          <b>***UPDATE: Police believe to have found the remains of Aniah Blanchard (details here)</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>More than a month after Aniah Blanchard went missing in Auburn, Alabama, a second suspect has now been arrested and charged in connection with her disappearance, according to <a href="https://www.wrbl.com/news/crime/news-3-obtains-affidavit-in-arrest-of-second-suspect-in-aniah-blanchard-case/">WRBL.com</a>, for what the police affidavit describes as “providing transportation” and “disposing of evidence.”</p>
      <p>Blanchard is the stepdaughter of UFC heavyweight Walt Harris.</p>
      <p>Antwon “Squirmy” Fisher, 35, was apprehended by U.S. Marshals last Friday night (Nov. 22, 2019) and joins 30-year-old Ibraheem Yazeed behind bars. Judge Steve Speakman denied bond based on Fisher’s extensive criminal history, which includes three years served for capital murder back in 2005.</p>
      <p>Forensic evidence recovered from Blanchard’s car suggests foul play.</p>
      <p>Yazeed also has a rap sheet that will make your head spin — including murder — and yet both men were free to come and go as they please while a mother of four got 12 years in Oklahoma City for <a href="https://kfor.com/2012/08/29/patricia-spottedcrow-re-released-from-prison-back-in-work-release/">selling $30 worth of pot</a>. The United States criminal justice system was, is, and may forever be an unfixable mess that often does more harm than good.</p>
      <p>A preliminary hearing is set for December 18th.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information as to Blanchard’s whereabouts is asked to contact the Auburn Police Division Detective Section at 334-501-3140, the anonymous tip line at 334-246-1391, or the 24-hour non-emergency number at 334-501-3100.</p>
