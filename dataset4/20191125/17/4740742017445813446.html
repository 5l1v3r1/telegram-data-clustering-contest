      <h1>Stream through park in St Werburgh's turns 'milky white'</h1>
      <h2>There are concerns over impact on environment</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:02:48+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:02</time> by <a rel="author">Alexander Brock</a></address>
      <p>Residents have been left baffled and concerned after a stream in a park abruptly turned "milky white".</p>
      <p>The water in Mina Road Park in St Werburgh's in Bristol suddenly changed colour on Monday afternoon (November 25), leaving people living nearby anxious about possible impacts on wildlife.</p>
      <p>The Environment Agency is yet to respond to <i>Bristol Live </i>on the issue.</p>
      <p>Molly Gilbert, who lives next to the stream, said the strange phenomenon has happened several times in the past.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old said: "It's horrible and makes me want to cry.</p>
      <p>"We have got a a very fragile ecosystem in the park with the sticklebacks and Kingfishers.</p>

      <p>"It could have a horrible impact and that's awful.</p>
      <p>"Its about time someone looked into this as the problem as it's so intermittent that I think people forget about it."</p>
      <p>She went on to say that the milky water smelt like "chemicals" and that the substance in the water often disappears within minutes.</p>
      <p>Hugh Holden, from the Mina Road Parkgroup, added the mysterious occurrence happens "fairly regularly".</p>
      <p>A spokesman for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-council">Bristol City Council</a> has said it is not something the council had been made aware of previously.</p>
      <p>The Environment Agency has been contacted for comment.</p>
