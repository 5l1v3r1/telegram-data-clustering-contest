      <p>A deluded student put lives at risk by setting fire to her Plymouth flat in the night after pouring cooking oil over the room, a court heard.</p>
      <p>Seven neighbouring flats in the block had to be evacuated but hardly any damage was caused.</p>
      <p>Chichi Ofoegbu, studying law at the University of Plymouth, admitted starting the fire at her home in St Judes, the city's Crown Court heard.</p>
      <p>She pleaded guilty to arson reckless as to whether life was endangered in Seymour Avenue on May 11.</p>
      <p>Ofoegbu also admitted causing criminal damage to the taxi on May 6.</p>
      <p>She has since been held for treatment at a psychiatric unit.</p>
      <p>Judge James Townsend, after reading two reports from doctors, told her: “I have to sentence you for what is a serious offence of arson potentially putting the lives of others in danger.</p>
      <p>"It is quite clear that when you committed this offence and, indeed the previous criminal damage, you were in the grip of a psychotic episode.</p>
      <p>“It is sad to see you here. You are of good character and have never been in trouble before. You are someone with considerable promise. I hope you will be released in the near future.”</p>
      <p>The judge passed a Hospital Order under the Mental Health Act which will see Ofoegbu detained for treatment under doctors consider it is safe for her to be released.</p>
