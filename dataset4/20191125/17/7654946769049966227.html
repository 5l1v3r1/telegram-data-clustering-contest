      <p>Brian Poole just wants his ball back.</p>
      <p>A fan in a green No. 24 Jets jersey grabbed a football out of the Jets cornerback Brian Poole’s hand Sunday as Poole celebrated his first career touchdown, having returned an interception for a score during <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/jets-completely-dominate-raiders-for-third-straight-win/">the Jets’ 34-3 rout over the Raiders</a>. Poole took to Twitter to implore the fan to give the ball back.</p>
      <p>“Hey You Whoever You Are. I Have A Signed Jersey For You BUT I NEED THAT BALL BACK! #FindPoolePickSix👀,” Poole <a href="https://twitter.com/poolioo/status/1198961103780372481?s=20">wrote</a> while posting a picture with the fan holding the ball in the background. The Jets’ official Twitter account retweeted Poole’s tweet.</p>
      <p>Sportsbook Bovada <a href="https://twitter.com/BovadaOfficial/status/1198982409926184966?s=20">tweeted</a> that it would give $100 credit if the fan gives the ball back.</p>
      <p>The CBS broadcast of the game showed a pair of hands snatching the ball from Poole’s right hand as he was mobbed by teammates near the stands.</p>
      <p>Poole, 27, signed a one-year, $3 million free-agent deal with the Jets during the offseason.</p>
