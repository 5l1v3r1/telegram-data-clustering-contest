      <p>Disney Plus’ live-action “Star Wars” series, “The Mandalorian,” has made waves since it debuted November 12 (thanks in no small part to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rian-johnson-saw-baby-yoda-on-the-mandalorian-set-2019-11">“Baby Yoda”</a>). And now the series has dethroned the streaming champion.</p>
      <p>Netflix’s “Stranger Things” enjoyed 21 straight weeks at the top of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/top-netflix-streaming-shows-this-week-the-crown-the-mandalorian-2019-11">Parrot Analytics’ weekly list</a> of the most in-demand original streaming shows in the US, but “The Mandalorian” has surpassed it. Parrot Analytics measures “demand expressions,” the company’s standardized TV demand measurement unit that reflect the desire, engagement, and viewership of a series weighted by importance.</p>
      <p>“The Mandalorian” had over 100 million demand expressions during the week of November 17 to November 23, according to Parrot Analytics, while “Stranger Things” had 81 million.</p>
      <p>Parrot Analytics data last week showed “The Mandalorian” surging toward the top of its list. It was already <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus-mandalorian-one-of-biggest-streaming-shows-of-year-2019-11">the most in-demand new original streaming series of the year</a> after one week of release, topping Netflix’s “The Umbrella Academy” and “When They See Us.”</p>
      <p>“While demand is a metric that should not be confused with subscriber numbers, this is a strong indication that the ‘Star Wars’ series is driving a lot of sign-ups to the recently-debuted Disney Plus service,” a Parrot Analytics representative said.</p>
      <p>Disney said that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus-has-10-million-sign-ups-since-launch-subscribers-2019-11">the service had 10 million sign-ups</a> a day after launching.</p>
      <p>“The Mandalorian” isn’t just a hit with audiences. It has a 90% Rotten Tomatoes critic score after three episodes. Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-mandalorian-is-an-old-school-worthy-star-wars-series-2019-11">said in its review of the first episode</a> that the series “proves ‘Star Wars’ can make the leap from movies to prestige TV.”</p>
