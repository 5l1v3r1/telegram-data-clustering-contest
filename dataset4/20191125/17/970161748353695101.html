        <b>Piers Morgan doubled down on never turning vegan after Gemma Collins offered to have sex with him to see if he ‘lasts longer’.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It looks like the Good Morning Britain host <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/piers-morgan-slams-utter-nonsense-netflix-vegan-documentary-joking-try-sex-changing-diet-gemma-collins-11212997/">wasn’t done attacking veganism after the show reported on </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/piers-morgan-slams-utter-nonsense-netflix-vegan-documentary-joking-try-sex-changing-diet-gemma-collins-11212997/"> documentary The Game Changer</a> which claimed veganism can improve your sex life and helps men ‘last three to four times longer’.</p>
      <p>He branded the entire study ‘utter nonsense’ and Gemma, being the Good Samaritan she is, was willing to ‘have sex’ with Piers to see if he lasts longer.</p>
      <p>Although the comment had him laughing and blushing on the show, Piers took to Twitter to comment: ‘This is unlikely to turn me vegan’.</p>
      <p>Sorry, Gemma.</p>
      <p>The TV personality is very passionate about being anti-vegan and will stop at nothing to make sure everyone knows it.</p>

      <p>During the segment this morning, host Susanna asked him:  ‘Why don’t you do a compare and contrast, you can go vegan for a while?’</p>
      <p>Piers responded: ‘I don’t need to. But who’s going to try me out?’</p>
      <p>Shocking everyone in the studio, Gemma excitedly answered: ‘Me!’</p>

      <p>The entire exchange in the conversation had everyone wondering how a debate on vegan diets turned to having sex with Piers.</p>
      <p>Yeah, not the sentence we wanted to write today.</p>
      <p>Piers was wondering the same thing, apparently, and said: ‘How have we got to me having sex with Susanna and Gemma Collins to test if meat-eating is good or bad for your virility?’</p>
      <p>This entire topic is a train wreck but we’re here for it.</p>
      <p>‘After a meat-free meal, the men’s night-time…lasted. It’s not that they lasted longer, it’s that the…interest lasted longer,’ Susanna explained to Piers on how the diet helps, evidently not allowed to say ‘erection’ on breakfast telly.</p>
      <p>Quoting the study, she continued: ‘This is not a scientifically-validated study but the results that we’re seeing [are] very exciting.’</p>
