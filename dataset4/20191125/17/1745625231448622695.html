      <h3>Australian Bombshell Gabby Epstein Rocks Tiny Bikini As She Poses With Her ‘Spirit Animal’</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/gabby-epstein/">Gabby Epstein</a> recently shot a campaign for a swimwear brand in a paradisiacal location in the Atlantic Ocean, and she shared a few snippets with her loyal Instagram fans.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, November 24, the <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5752087/gabby-epstein-skinny-dipping-instagram/">Australian bombshell</a> took to the popular social media app to post a couple of snapshots in which she rocked a bikini while shooting with her “spirit animal.” In the photos, Epstein can be seen standing next to a horse on a beach in Turks and Caicos Islands, as she indicated via the tag added to her post. The model also added a horse emoji to the caption, suggesting that is her spirit animal.</p>
      <p>Epstein rocked a two-piece bathing suit that boasted a detailed snakeskin print in varying shades of brown, beige and orange. The bikini consists of a triangle top with thin straps that tie up behind the model’s neck, while its tiny cups leave plenty of skin on display. According to the caption, Epstein was shooting a campaign for Luli Fama Swimwear, a Miami-based label that often gets a shoutout on Instagram from models and social media influencers.</p>
      <p>Neither photo shows her bikini bottoms. The first is a close-up that captures Epstein from the waist up, so her lower body is not visible. The second photo features her full body, showing that Epstein paired her bikini top with a cheetah-print beach skirt that sits just above her bellybutton, leaving her toned upper abs on display.</p>

      <p>Epstein wore her blonde hair in a middle part and styled down. Large, loose waves fell over her shoulders, giving her the perfect beach hairstyle. The model wore black eyeliner and a light shade of eyeshadow, which adds drama to her gaze. A dark shade of red lipstick completed her makeup. She accessorized her look with gold necklaces and some rings that add shine to her look.</p>
      <p>Since going live, the post — which Epstein shared with her 2.2 million Instagram followers — has garnered about 43,000 likes in under a day of being published, as of the time of this writing. The same time period also brought in upwards of 370 comments to the photos.</p>
      <p>Users of the social media platform who are fans of Epstein used this opportunity to rave about her beauty, and also to engage with her caption in which she asked her fans what their spirit animal was.</p>

      <p>“Ur my spirit animal,” one user wrote.</p>
      <p>“God these photos are too good,” said another user.</p>
      <p>“Great horned owl,” added a third fan, including a string of fire emoji after the words.</p>
