      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The singer was crowned King of the Jungle back in 2013 and warns that this year's celebs are soon to hit the downward spiral</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:49:55+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:49</time> by <a rel="author">Vicki Newman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/vicki-newman/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/westlife">Westlife</a> 's Kian Egan says this year's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> campmates are about to hit a downward spiral.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kian-egan">The singer</a> was crowned King of the Jungle in 2013, and knows all too well how hunger can affect the mood in the camp.</p>
      <p>Kian, 39, looked back on his time Down Under as he popped into Mirror Online's offices with his bandmates Mark Feehily and Nicky Byrne.</p>
      <p>The lads, who were without Shane Filan who was too poorly to attend, sat down with us for an exclusive chat about the last 20 years since the release of their debut album and their new album Spectrum going to No1.</p>
      <p>Looking back on Kian's victorious jungle stint, Nicky joked: "Which means none of the rest can ever go on it because we can only be a loser unless we win it."</p>

      <p>When asked for his top tips, Kian said: "I think you just have to stay calm for the first week. A lot of people go in there and they're like all in your face and then the hunger kicks in and the energy dips, but we're not really seeing that yet.</p>
      <p>"Ian [Wright] is slowly getting it, but this is the point and it's started turning slowly last night, I was watching it and all the men in particular are starting to get a little bit edgy and a little bit twitchy and that is their hunger and tiredness and this is where it's all going to kick off and it's like getting through that period is the key.</p>
      <p>"That's where the mental challenge comes in. For now, it's all just fun and games and everyone is having a bit of craic but once you start getting really hungry and your body starts shutting down and you start becoming really weak and tired all the time, that's the key whether you can get through that."</p>

      <p>Kian, who shares three children with wife Jodi, said there were two days in the jungle that he was so weak with hunger he couldn't get out of bed.</p>
      <p>And things got so bad that ITV bosses had to send in electrolytes - minerals that have an electric charge - to help him get through it.</p>
      <p>He told us: "I had two days completely lying down on the bed and they had to send me in electrolytes to pick myself back up.</p>
      <p>"I definitely was lacking in vitamins and stuff like that. There were probably one of two days when Jodi said to me, 'What happened to you? They just didn't show you'. And I was out, I was on the bed. You do all the things that are part of the daily schedule but you'd be half-hearted doing them and then as soon as you get back you're just straight back in your bed.</p>

      <p>"She was definitely worried at one point. Your body does go through a huge change in there, you're really shocking your system, but you can either come out of it or you can't and I saw the people who couldn't come out of it.</p>
      <p>"Joey Essex got to that point where he just couldn't come out of it and after a week he was done."</p>
      <p>Kian has been tuning in this series, and has already picked out his favourites.</p>
      <p>He said: "Watching it so far, Jacqueline [Jossa] is definitely very strong but she's going to come to a breaking point and it's going to be one way or the other for her.</p>

      <p>"Roman Kemp is doing very well. I like Ian Wright, it's whether he can keep it together or not now so it'll be interesting.</p>
      <p>"I think Ian could potentially win.</p>
      <p>"Nadine [Coyle] is very quiet, but sometimes the quiet ones just sneak through, because no one is voting them and nobody's not voting for them and then they're in the final five."</p>
