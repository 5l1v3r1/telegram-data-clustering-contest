      <p>Richard and Judy were seen flying out of Australia looking glum amid a dramatic couple of days for their family.</p>
      <p>The TV presenting duo, who have been married for 33 years, were snapped leaving a luxury hotel in Kingscliff, New South Wales.</p>
      <p>Their outing comes after Mirror Online exclusively revealed that the couple's son-in-law James Haskell made a secret sex tape of his best mate romping with a schoolgirl who didn't know she was being filmed.</p>
      <p>James, who is wed to Richard and Judy's daughter Chloe Madeley, hid a camera in a cupboard to film best pal Paul Doran-Jones having sex with a naked sixth former before brazenly showing the pornographic footage to pals.</p>

      <p>Haskell, who was 17 and a student at Wellington College in Crowthorne, Berks at the time, was later suspended for his filming - pal Doran-Jones was expelled.</p>
      <p>The story seemed to weigh heavy on the couple as they looked downcast on their outing.</p>
      <p>Richard, 63, pushed along the pair's suitcases and kept his face covered with a big pair of sunglasses.</p>

      <p>Judy, 71, kept covered in black striped trousers, a matching t-shirt and a pink patterned shawl draped over her shoulders.</p>
      <p>She carried a straw bag in one hand and a notebook and iPad in the other.</p>

      <p>Richard and Judy are yet to comment on their son-in-law's sex tape.</p>
      <p>It is thought Haskell, who is appearing in I'm A Celebrity 2019, escaped expulsion from his Â£19,000 a year school for the 2003 incident as he was an England rugby hopeful.</p>
      <p>Bizarrely, Haskell, now 34, was seen laughing about the video in an interview filmed just eight months ago before branding the tape a "stupid mistake."</p>

      <p>Laughing on male entertainment channel JOE with Doran-Jones, the now married Haskell sipped a pint of Guinness as he jokingly pointed at filming equipment: "Remote cameras! That would have been the perfect crime.</p>
      <p>"All I am going to say is this. My idea, Paul was execution, I wasn't in the cupboard at all."</p>
      <p>He added: "We decided to set up a home video club and it went horribly wrong. It was a stupid mistake that we both regret. The worst thing was I was portrayed as having been involved... I was nothing to do with it apart from, obviously, it was my idea."</p>
