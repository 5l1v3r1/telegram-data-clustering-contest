      <h2>I'm A Celebrity's James Haskell was one of the guests on a boat party from hell where young rugby players allegedly took part in sex acts and humiliating pranks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:50:41+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:50</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity star James Haskell's lurid past life has come back to haunt him after his confession that he filmed a 17-year-old female classmate having sex with his best friend.</p>
      <p>The former England rugby ace also found himself at the centre of controversy two years ago when he was accused of being part of a riverboat party from hell, during which young athletes allegedly took part in humiliating pranks and group sex acts that allegedly left the top deck covered in faeces.</p>
      <p>James allegedly demanded that staff working onboard The Hurlingham on the evening of May 8, 2016, turn off the seven CCTV cameras for the Wasps summer party.</p>
      <p>His alleged demand came after James' father is said to have previously emailed party organisers the night before to insist "there is to be absolutely no photography or video records or recordings of any type or nature", the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3863020/England-rugby-star-James-Haskell-held-court-sexually-degrading-boat-trip-party.html">Daily Mail</a> reported in October of that year.</p>

      <p>And, according to the boat's safety officer Dean Fergusson and several other staff, the events that night were "really disgusting", shocking and "overwhelming".</p>
      <p>"None of us had seen anything like it - it turned into something dark and wrong," he told the newspaper.</p>
      <p>James and around 40 other players boarded The Hurlingham at Richmond, south-west London, at around 2pm.</p>
      <p>Some had been drinking beforehand and many were angry that the boat was an hour late because of the low tide.</p>
      <p>When the boat next stopped at Richmond lock, the lockmaster had to tell the boat's captain to turn down the music and get a topless woman, who had been mingling with the players on the open-air top deck, out of sight of the families passing by.</p>
      <p>James then allegedly stepped up to the microphone to declare the 'kanga court' - a type of mob justice where punishments are doled out for perceived misdemeanours - open.</p>
      <p>Fergusson revealed the top deck was left covered in excrement, saying: "It was really disgusting and we had to get cleaners in afterwards," adding that the three-hour party "turned into something dark and wrong".</p>
      <p>Catherine Mahoney, who was working behind the bar on the boat, told the newspaper that she felt intimidated by some of the players - although she stressed many disapproved of the events going on around them.</p>
      <p>"It got too much for me, it was overwhelming," she said.</p>

      <p>"I just didn't understand it. I asked some of the players at the bar why they were doing this. They were just laughing, which made me feel really uneasy."</p>
      <p>Burlesque dancer Keri Graham had been booked to perform a show below deck, but later spoke of her shock at what some of the players got up to.</p>
      <p>"I realised things weren't going to go as expected when they asked everyone to hand in their mobile phones as we got on the boat."</p>
      <p>She went on to allege some men were "sitting in a line" performing sex acts, adding: "I felt horrified. They acted as if it was normal."</p>
      <p>The boat was due to take the players up the Thames past Big Ben, before dropping them at Cadogan Pier in Chelsea - but the decision was taken to let them off at Chiswick.</p>
      <p>"I felt frightened and degraded and the girls felt the same," he said.</p>
      <p>Two days after the party, England player Sam Jones contacted the boat operator and apologised "on behalf of the boys", saying "staff weren't shown the respect they deserve" in response to a conversation with Out On The Thames booking agent, Wayne Eldridge.</p>
      <p>But the boat owners were unhappy with the apology and escalated the complaint to the Wasps club to ask for compensation for "distress and damage".</p>

      </figure>
      <p>After three meetings between the club, its lawyers and the boat operators, the club made a complaint to police alleging blackmail, which the boat company vehemently denied.</p>
      <p>A police probe was launched into the blackmail allegations but later wrapped up, with a Met Police spokesperson saying: "No allegations were substantiated. Our investigation is now complete."</p>
      <p>An internal investigation launched by Wasps CEO David Armstrong resulted in the reprimanding of one academy player, although his name was never made public.</p>
      <p>Mr Armstrong said in a statement that the players strongly disputed "alleged harassment and intimidation of on-board staff or that safety on board was jeopardised".</p>
      <p>James and Wasps declined to comment at the time.</p>
