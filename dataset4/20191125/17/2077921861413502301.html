      <p>Arbor Labor Union released their last record, <i>I Hear You</i>, back in 2016, garnering a <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/11/arbor-labor-union-the-best-of-whats-next.html">Best of What’s Next</a> feature from <i>Paste</i> that highlighted the band’s “transcendental weirdness” and “hard-edged bite.” Today (Nov. 25), they’ve announced a follow-up, <i>New Petal Instants</i>, due Feb. 7, 2020.</p>
      <p>The lead single off <i>New Petal Instants</i> continues the band’s psychedelic-infused blues sound and reflects the record’s theme of growth and greenery. Titled “Flowerhead,” it’s a paean to the bond between all living things: “I was born with dandelion eyes / Learned to dance by watching butterflies.” Its visual accompaniment joyfully intersperses collage-based stop-motion (including a series of faces being made out of leaves) with clips from nature footage, goofy retro dance videos and DVD guitar lessons—all surrounded by a groovy rainbow border.</p>
