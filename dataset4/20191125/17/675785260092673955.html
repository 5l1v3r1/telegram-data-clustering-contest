      <h1>Katie Price shocks fans with extreme new look as she preps for TV interview with Harvey</h1>
      <h2>Katie Price, 41, took to her Instagram stories to post a picture of herself getting ready for a TV appearance with her son Harvey</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:54:56+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:54</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Pike, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/molly-pike/</a></address>
      <p>Katie Price has always been known for changing up her looks as a self-confessed fan of plastic surgery, but her new image will shock even her most loyal fans.</p>
      <p>The former glamour model, 41, took to her Instagram stories to post a picture of herself getting ready for a TV appearance with her son Harvey, 17, tonight.</p>
      <p>In the photo she appeared to be having her microphone adjusted as she stared moodily down the camera lens.</p>
      <p>But she looked worlds away from her usual self in the snap, with her eyes looking strangely bright and her skin looking extrordinarily smooth.</p>

      <p>Katie captioned the post: "Catch me on Channel 5 news this evening with my main man Harvey Price and Anna Kennedy OBE."</p>
      <p>She also posted another photo of herself and Harvey hanging out with members of the crew.</p>
      <p>Even in that photo she looked completely different to the one posted on her stories.</p>

      <p>It comes after Katie was accused of sharing old pictures of her children to make it look like she was spending time with them.</p>
      <p>She posted a snap of Princess saying they were having a "day out together" but it seems to be an old photo from a previous photo shoot for her fashion brand.</p>
      <p>It followed the time her estranged husband - and Bunny's dad - Kieran Hayler hinted he was upset with Katie for posting a picture of Bunny and brother Jett, six, that he'd already shared.</p>

      <p>"Never be intimidated by someone who copies you," a quote he shared read, "The original is always better than the copy."</p>
      <p>Katie also baffled fans with a post of Jett in the garden with big brother and Katie's eldest Harvey, writing: "Love Sunday mornings with my boys."</p>
      <p>Jett also appeared on Kieran's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> , prompting one fan to mock: "Those kids are remarkable; two places at once."</p>
