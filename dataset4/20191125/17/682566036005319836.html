      <p>A skillful seam bowler and a left-handed batsman, De Swardt is part of the Emerging Squad that is due to assemble on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Paarl Rocks coach, Adrian Birrell, said De Swardt would give the team more options.</p>
      <p>“With James Vince coming in to strengthen our top order, we needed another all-rounder to balance out the squad.</p>
      <p>“Ruan has lots of potential and I’m confident he’ll add some real value in the middle-order and gives us more options in our bowling attack as well,” said Birrell.</p>
      <p>De Swardt spend some time with the Paarl Rocks team last week and will join the squad once final approval has been received from the MSL. </p>
      <p>In another setback for the team Dwaine Pretorius injured his right hand against the Cape Town Blitz on Sunday, but he will remain with the squad. </p>
