      <p>Those hoping to get some answers regarding Supreme Leader Snoke's identity from <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/category/movies/news-movies/">Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</a> </i>may end up leaving the theater disappointed.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://uproxx.com/movies/jj-abrams-interview-the-rise-of-skywalker-star-wars/2/"><i>Uproxx</i></a>, director J.J. Abrams refused to give a clear answer on whether or not the film will provide any details about Snoke's identity or past, instead emphasizing the finality of the film.</p>

      <p>"I will say, without giving anything away, knowing this movie is an ending is, for me infinitely more challenging than a beginning," he said. "We knew we needed to provide answers. And while there may be some things that aren’t entirely demystified by the end of it, we wanted to make sure people left feeling that they were satisfied. So I hope, on a number of issues, people will leave and feel like that it’s a true ending and not an advertising ploy. We really are bringing it to an end."</p>
