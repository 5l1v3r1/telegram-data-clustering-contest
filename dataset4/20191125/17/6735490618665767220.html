      <p>The novel, to be published by Penguin Random House, is described as “a fearless semi-autobiographical novel, a deconstruction of persona. In it, Jim Carrey and Dana Vachon have fashioned a story about acting, Hollywood, agents, celebrity, privilege, friendship, romance, addiction to relevance, fear of personal erasure, our ‘one big soul,’ Canada, and a cataclysmic ending of the world–apocalypses within and without.”</p>
      <p>And according to Carrey, “None of this is real and all of it is true.”</p>
      <p>He has previously penned a children’s book<i> How Roland Rolls</i>.</p>
      <p><i>Memoirs And Misinformation</i> will be available for purchase on May 5, 2020.</p>
