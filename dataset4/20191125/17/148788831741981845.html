      <h1>‘Watchmen’ Reveals the First Superhero Team Ever With Official Minutemen Image</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:30:42+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/chris-evangelista/" target="_blank">Chris Evangelista</a></address>
      <p>The most recent episode of <b><i>Watchmen</i></b> went back in time to show us the birth of costumed crimefighters. It also gave us a fleeting glimpse of the Minutemen, the original crime-fighting team that would inspire superheroes for years to come. Most of the members of the Minutemen were out-of-focus and in the background in the episode itself, but a new photo released by HBO gives us a nice, clear look at them.</p>

      <p>Behold: The Minutemen. From left to right:  Silhouette, Mothman, Dollar Bill, Nite Owl, Captain Metropolis, Silk Spectre, Hooded Justice, and, kneeling in front, The Comedian. The most recent episode of <i>Watchmen</i>, “<a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/watchmen-this-extraordinary-being-review/">This Extraordinary Being</a>“, revealed the origins of Hooded Justice, and had the character spend some quality time with Captain Metropolis, AKA Nelson Gardner. The rest of the team, however, didn’t get much facetime.</p>
      <p>For the sake of comparison, here’s the same team in the <i>Watchmen</i> movie.</p>

      <p>Per the <i>Watchmen</i> <a href="https://watchmen.fandom.com/wiki/Minutemen">Wiki</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The Minutemen were the premier group of superheroes throughout the 1940s. They were founded in 1939, largely through the actions of Nelson Gardner (Captain Metropolis), Sally Jupiter (the first Silk Spectre) and Sally Jupiter’s agent Laurence Schexnayder. Schexnayder also provided the group’s publicity. After several public controversies, the group finally disbanded in 1949.</blockquote>
