      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:16:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:16</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Apple Inc and semiconductor stocks powered the S&amp;P 500 and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nasdaq">Nasdaq </a>indexes to record highs on Monday, after a report signaled that the United States and China were nearing a trade truce, with sentiment also buoyed by a raft of mega deals.</p>
      <p>Trade-sensitive Intel Corp and Applied Materials Inc helped lift the Philadelphia Semiconductor index 2.1% as a Chinese state-backed tabloid said Beijing and Washington were "very close" to an initial pact.</p>
      <p>That added to optimism from comments over the weekend by a top U.S. official that an agreement was still possible by the end of the year, dispelling fears that the negotiations could carry on into 2020.</p>
      <p>"The mood is pretty positive at this point," said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.</p>
      <p>"You got mergers today, which are typically positive for the market, and I think you still have some optimism that there's going to be a trade deal."</p>
      <p>Trade deal hopes and robust third-quarter corporate earnings have helped Wall Street's main indexes hit record highs this month.</p>
      <p>Gains on Monday were broad-based, with the tech-heavy <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nasdaq">Nasdaq </a>firming over 1% and 10 of the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors higher. Apple Inc rose 1.3% and was the biggest boost to all the three main indexes.</p>
      <p>At 10:34 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 149.97 points, or 0.54%, at 28,025.59, while the S&amp;P 500 was up 20.90 points, or 0.67%, at 3,131.19. The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nasdaq">Nasdaq </a>Composite was up 98.30 points at 8,618.19.</p>
      <p>In M&amp;As, Tiffany &amp; Co jumped 6.2% after the luxury jeweler agreed to a sweetened $16.2 billion deal with France's LVMH.</p>
      <p>U.S. discount brokerage TD Ameritrade Holding Corp was up 6% after larger rival Charles Schwab Corp said it would buy the company in an all-stock deal valued at about $26 billion. Schwab was up about 1.5%.</p>
      <p>EBay Inc gained 1.3% after the e-commerce major said it would sell ticketing unit StubHub to ticket reseller Viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash.</p>
      <p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3.72-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.69-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P index recorded 29 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 70 new highs and 34 new lows.</p>
