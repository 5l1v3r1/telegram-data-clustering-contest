      <p>Even though the government imposed a new smoking ban to take effect this year, and even gave Malaysians a one-year warning period before enforcing it, some citizens have yet to take the new public ruling seriously. After all, authorities won’t ACTUALLY fine or arrest you if you’re caught right? Think <i>again</i>.</p>

      <p>Two weeks ago, two middle-aged men from Kajang, Selangor were arrested after they were caught smoking in a non-smoking eatery at approximately 8am in the morning, following reports from <a href="http://www.chinapress.com.my/20191124/%e5%90%b8%e7%83%9f%e8%a2%ab%e9%98%bb%e6%89%93%e4%ba%ba%e8%80%85%e8%90%bd%e7%bd%91%e4%ba%86-2%e5%ab%8c%e7%8a%af%e5%bb%b6%e6%89%a34%e5%a4%a9/">China Press</a>.</p>
      <p>The smokers were first cautioned by Zhang, a 35-year-old manager who was eating at the restaurant with his family. The kind citizen tried to advise the two smokers to not smoke in a public place following the smoking ban that was imposed as they could be fined RM10,000.</p>
      <p>However, the two men, aged 39 and 43 respectively, ignored his advice and continued smoking. Zhang’s wife then proceeded to take a photo of the smokers to launch a report with the Ministry of Health. That’s when the two men started getting angry and headed over to the family’s table to threaten them.</p>

      <p>“Come on, let’s go out and fight”, they said to Zhang and<b> slapped him in front of his wife and 3-year-old child! </b>The poor manager said he was left with “a swollen face and broken lips” from the physical altercation.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, other diners stepped in before the fight could escalate. The family abruptly left the eatery but the smokers reportedly continued to smoke at the premises.</p>
      <p>Following the incident, Zhang said he hoped that the Ministry of Health would review the complaint helpline to ensure the safety of those who report public offenders that smoke in non-smoking eateries as to prevent future situations like these from happening.</p>
