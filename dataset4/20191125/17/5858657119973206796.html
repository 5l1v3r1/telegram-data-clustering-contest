      <p>LAVAL, Que. — Australian company Caltex says it has received an unsolicited purchase offer from Alimentation Couche-Tard valued at C$7.7 billion.</p>
      <p>If the offer is accepted, the Laval, Que.-based Couche-Tard would make a first breakthrough in the Australian market.</p>
      <p>The proposal for AU$34.50 per share is for the redemption of all Caltex shares outstanding.</p>
      <p>This is an unsolicited, non-binding, conditional and confidential offer, the company said in a statement released Tuesday morning local time.</p>
      <p>The proposal also includes the payment of certain dividends to shareholders at the time of the eventual takeover.</p>
      <p>Caltex says a previous offer at AU$32 per share was rejected by the shareholders for being value too low.</p>
      <p>Caltex operates approximately 2,000 service stations where it operates gasoline and retail sales.</p>
      <p>The offer is subject to audit and approval, as well as a vote of the boards of directors of both companies involved.</p>
