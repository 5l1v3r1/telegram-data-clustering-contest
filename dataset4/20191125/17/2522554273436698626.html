      <h1>French Montana Says He’s Been in ICU for Six Days</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:43:54+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/marisamendez/" target="_blank">Marisa Mendez</a></address>
      <p>Days <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/11/french-montana-hospital-heart-rate-stomach-pain/">after being admitted</a> into the ICU, <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/french-montana/">French Montana</a> remains there.</p>
      <p>On Monday morning (Nov. 24), the "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Explicit-Rvssian-French-Montana/dp/B07YCBW4GS?SubscriptionId=AKIAJYPOGEBYCEUS42SQ&amp;tag=xxlmagtsm-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B07YCBW4GS">Writing on the Wall</a>" rapper shared an update from his hospital bed. As he panned the room in a video showing an IV in his arm and a dry erase board that read "manage pain," French revealed he still had not been discharged.</p>
      <p>"6 days in icu," the <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/07/french-montana-xxl-cover-digital-issue/">Bronx rapper</a> wrote with a prayer hands emoji.</p>

      <p>French was reportedly admitted to the San Fernando Valley Hospital on Thursday night (Nov. 21), so if that's the case, it actually means it's been nearly four days since he was admitted rather than the six days he mentions in this tweet. The rapper had been experiencing cardiac issues and intense nausea at his home and ended up being taken into the hospital after cops showed up for what ended up being a false alarm for a robbery.</p>
      <p>As previously reported, one of French's neighbors was under the belief that the rapper's <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/11/playboi-carti-iggy-azalea-home-burglarized-jewelry-stolen/">house was being burglarized</a>, so they called the police. When cops arrived, there was no robber to be found, but they did find that French was experiencing some major health issues. They ended up calling 911 and had him taken to the nearest hospital where he's remained in ICU ever since.</p>
      <p>French was expected to be released the next day after receiving IV fluids, but that is obviously no longer the case. It remains unclear what the rapper is actually suffering from, though folks have been speculating that he may have been exposed to contaminated food during his recent trips to Europe and his home country of Morocco in Africa. However, issues related to contaminated food usually don't persist as long as French has been showing symptoms so it may be a deeper issue.</p>
      <p>French is expected to deliver his third studio album, <i>Montana</i>, this month.</p>

      <h3>Aquemini, Outkast</h3>
      <p><b>Weak Song:</b> "Mamacita"</p>
      <p>Outkast's <i>Aquemini</i> built upon the duo's track record of delivering cohesive bodies of work and received overwhelming praise from the rap community upon hitting shelves. However, this posse cut, which includes an insufferable hook and uninspired production, results in it being a rare throwaway from Big Boi and André 3000.</p>

      <h3>Blank Face LP, ScHoolboy Q</h3>
      <p><b>Weak Song:</b> "Big Body"</p>
      <p>ScHoolboy Q avoided the sophomore jinx with his <i>Blank Face LP</i>, which saw the TDE star deliver one of the superior releases of the year. However, this collaborative effort featuring Tha Dogg Pound and produced by Tyler, the Creator is an outlier that slightly misses the mark.</p>

      <h3>Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood, DMX</h3>
      <p><b>Weak Song:</b> "The Omen (Damien II)"</p>
      <p>After running the table with his debut <i>It's Dark and Hell Is Hot</i>, DMX returned with this historic sophomore offering. Peaking at No. 1 on the charts—making him the first rap artist to reach Billboard's summit twice in the same calendar year—the album was another tour de force, outside of this tepid Marilyn Manson-guested sequel to "Damien."</p>

      <h3>Graduation, Kanye West</h3>
      <p><b>Weak Song:</b> "Drunk &amp; Hot Girls"</p>
      <p>Kanye West's trifecta of classics was completed with <i>Graduation</i>, an album that captured the Louis Vuitton Don at his apex. Despite all of the firepower on the album, this debacle of a record remains one of the most unforgivable musical contributions of Kanye's career.</p>

      <h3>In My Lifetime, Vol. 1, Jay-Z</h3>
      <p><b>Weak Song:</b> "I Know What Girls Like"</p>
      <p>Jay-Z's achieved critical acclaim with <i>Reasonable Doubt</i>, however, the same cannot be said for commercial success. This led to the Roc-A-Fella founder straying outside of his comfort zone on his sophomore album, resulting in this odd collaboration with Lil Kim and Diddy that samples “I Know What Boys Like” by punk band The Waitresses.</p>

      <h3>Life Is Good, Nas</h3>
      <p><b>Weak Song:</b> "Summer on Smash"</p>
      <p>Adversity seems to bring out the best in Nas, as his divorce from ex-wife and R&amp;B star Kelis inspired one of the stronger efforts of his career. Nearly immaculate from beginning to end, Nas' penchant for pedestrian club bangers rears its head with this Swizz Beatz-produced number, resulting in the album's lone sore spot.</p>

      <h3>Lord Willin', Clipse</h3>
      <p><b>Weak Song:</b> "Ego"</p>
      <p>Pusha-T and Malice brought coke rap back to the forefront with this high-powered debut, which is stacked with a mixture of street anthems and catchy club bangers. One selection that sticks out like a sore thumb is this number, which is built around a subpar Neptunes beat that pales in comparison to the other instrumentals on the album.</p>

      <h3>My Krazy Life, YG</h3>
      <p><b>Weak Song:</b> "Me &amp; My Bitch"</p>
      <p>YG exceeded expectations with this debut album, which established the Compton native as one of the leaders of the New West. Comprised of a murderer's row of tracks, one selection that throws off the groove is this Tory Lanez-assisted offering, which lacks the punch of other collaborations on the album.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Nothing Was the Same, Drake</h3>
      <p><b>Weak Song:</b> "305 to My City"</p>
      <p>Nothing was the same after the release of Drake's third studio album, which marked his coronation as the bonafide king of mainstream rap. Comprised of some of his most refined work to date, the album's sole misstep comes in the form of this offering, which is ruined by the repetitive instrumental and producer Detail's jarring wails.</p>

      <h3>Ready to Die, The Notorious B.I.G.</h3>
      <p><b>Weak Song:</b> "Friend of Mine"</p>
      <p>The arrival of The Notorious B.I.G. and this landmark debut album challenged the West Coast's firm grip on the Billboard charts. Representing B.K. to the fullest with timeless singles, lyrical darts and conceptual cuts, Biggie hit on all cylinders, minus this unremarkable cut.</p>

      <h3>Stillmatic, Nas</h3>
      <p><b>Weak Song:</b> "Braveheart Party"</p>
      <p>With his back against the wall, Nas reminded listeners of his pedigree with the release of his fifth solo studio album, <i>Stillmatic</i>, one of his best works. However, a weak beat and hook on "Braveheart Party" results in the song being a snoozer and an automatic skip for even the most die-hard Esco fan. After the album dropped, featured artist Mary J. Blige reportedly requested that the song be removed from future CD pressings (it doesn't appear on streaming services, either).</p>

      <h3>Teflon Don, Rick Ross</h3>
      <p><b>Weak Song:</b> "Number One"</p>
      <p>Rick Ross' boss status was confirmed with this impressive long player, which saw the MMG general taking a victory lap alongside some of the biggest names in rap. One of the best curators in the game, Rozay's made a rare error in judgement by allowing the out-of-place "Number One" on the album's track list. The Diddy and Trey Songz-featured track would've been a much better fit on Dirty Money's <i>Last Train to Paris</i>, which dropped that same year.</p>

      <h3>The Black Album, Jay-Z</h3>
      <p><b>Weak Song:</b> "Justify My Thug"</p>
      <p>Billed as the ultimate swan song, this collection contained some of Jay-Z's most transparent testimonials and masterful lyrical performances. But Madonna's presence, along with DJ Quik's production, on this selection throws the proceedings off slightly, with many listeners pegging it as the weakest link on the otherwise pristine album.</p>

      <h3>The Blueprint, Jay-Z</h3>
      <p><b>Weak Song:</b> "Jigga That Nigga"</p>
      <p>The debate surrounding which Jay-Z album is his best is one of the more heated topics among rap fans. However, the presence of this polarizing record is usually the deciding factor in determining the pecking order between <i>The Blueprint</i> and Hov's seminal debut, <i>Reasonable Doubt</i>. And with good reason—its beat is a glitzy contrast to the album's soulful feel.</p>

      <h3>The Documentary, The Game</h3>
      <p><b>Weak Song:</b> "Special"</p>
      <p>In 2005, The Game rejuvenated West Coast hip-hop with this stellar debut. The one flaw that keeps the album from flawlessness is this Needlz-produced duet with Nate Dogg, which includes one of the late crooner's more lackluster performances and leaves much to be desired.</p>
