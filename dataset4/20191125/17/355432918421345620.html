      <h1>Sarah Sanders: 'I don't like being called a liar'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:39:24+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/aris-folley" target="_blank">Aris Folley</a></address>
      <p>Former White House press secretary <a href="https://thehill.com/people/sarah-sanders">Sarah Huckabee</a> Sanders said in a new interview that she does not “like being called a liar.”</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/us/politics/sarah-sanders-arkansas-governor.html">The New York Times</a>, Sanders recalled some of the attacks and criticism she faced while working in the Trump administration.</p>
      <p>“I was attacked for everything, not just my performance,” she said in an article published Sunday. “I was called a fat soccer mom, my kids were threatened, my life was threatened. It was a lot. I hate harping on it, but to be in the position I’m in and to have Secret Service, that’s not normal.”</p>
      <p>But Sanders, who left the Trump administration over the summer, said all of that "bothered” her “far less” than being called a liar.</p>
      <p>“I don’t like being called a liar,” she told the paper.</p>
      <p>Sanders, who had a contentious relationship with the press during her tenure at the Trump White House, captured national headlines last year after she acknowledged making a false statement about former FBI Director <a href="https://thehill.com/people/james-comey">James Comey</a>’s firing by <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a>.</p>
      <p>Sanders had told reporters that "countless" FBI agents lost confidence in the former FBI director. She later admitted to former special counsel <a href="https://thehill.com/people/robert-mueller">Robert Mueller</a>’s team that she made misstatements to the press, which she called then a "slip of the tongue.”</p>
      <p>In an <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/388965-sarah-sanders-being-called-a-liar-bothers-me">interview with the Times last year</a>, Sanders said she tried to deliver the “best and most accurate information at the time that I can” in her role with the Trump administration.</p>
      <p>“One of the few things you have are your integrity and reputation,” Sanders, who was once fact-checked live by CNN during a press briefing, said at the time. “There’s a difference between misspeaking or not knowing something than maliciously lying.”</p>
      <p>Last December, <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/420961-sarah-sanders-she-hopes-people-remember-her-as-being">Sanders said</a> she hopes to be remembered as being “transparent and honest” in her legacy as a White House press secretary.</p>
      <p>“I hope that it will be that I showed up every day and I did the very best job that I could to put forward the president’s message," she said, "to do the best job that I could to answer questions.”</p>
