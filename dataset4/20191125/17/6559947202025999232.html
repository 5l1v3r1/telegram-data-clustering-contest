      <p>What technology should you expect in the Black Friday sales? Read on to find out what we predict will be high ticket items with extra low prices.</p>
      <h4>When Does Black Friday 2019 Start?</h4>
      <hr/>
      <p>Officially, Black Friday 2019 kicks off on November 29. The biggest offers for the shopping event will run throughout the weekend and end on the Monday. Some deals will likely run into Cyber Monday, and possibly beyond, as the two events are now basically the same thing.</p>
      <p>Black Friday is another misnomer in the shopping event world, and the scale of the event has continued to grow, turning into what is essentially a whole month of deals.</p>
      <p>We predict you'll be getting at least one week worth of Black Friday bargains. Amazon will begin its Black Friday bargains on November 22, while Cyber Monday sales will extend past December 2 as well, so there are plenty of deals to choose from.</p>
      <h4>What is Black Friday and Cyber Monday?</h4>
      <hr/>
      <p>What used to be an exclusively US based event after Thanksgiving, Black Friday has transformed the UK shopping market into something else, and effectively created a shopping holiday for the whole country.</p>
      <p>Unlike the US, the UK seems more focused on online shopping rather than the typical 'Doorbuster' sales that can occur on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>
      <p>Cyber Monday is simply a continuation of Black Friday, although it used to be separated by a difference in products, you shouldn't expect this in 2019.</p>
      <p>November has become the month to buy tech in the UK, especially when it comes to Christmas gifts. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46917190">The BBC reported</a> last year that December shopping figures fell as a direct result of Black Friday sales.</p>
      <h4>How Long Does Black Friday Last?</h4>
      <hr/>
      <p>As we've previously mentioned, Black Friday has rapidly transformed from a single day into a much larger event.</p>
      <p>To spread out the time of sales, most retailers begin cutting prices much earlier than the intended sale date. This is why it can be slightly confusing as to when Black Friday actually begins.</p>
      <p>To a certain degree, ignore the singular date, and expect sales from November to at least the beginning of December. The biggest and best deals will still occur during or around the Black Friday weekend, but there will always be plenty of other bargains hanging around for the rest of the month.</p>

      <p>Put simply, there's no definite beginning and end date for the Black Friday sales now. By most accounts, Black Friday sales are at their best during the Black Friday weekend (Nov. 29 - Dec. 2, 2019).</p>

      <p>While <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/deals/118411/black-friday-2019-the-best-amazon-deals-in-the-uk">Amazon</a> likes to make its presence known during the shopping event, expect all the major retailers to also compete for a piece of the pie. The likes of AO, John Lewis, Currys PC World, and Argos will also be vying for your spare cash.</p>
      <h4>Apple Products: iPhone 11, iPad Pro, Apple AirPods, Apple Watch</h4>

      <p>​It's hard to deny that Apple produce some of the most popular pieces of tech on the market at the moment, and with the Apple iPhone 11 recently launching, don't be surprised when the likes of <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/deals/118375/black-friday-uk-the-best-carphone-warehouse-deals">Carphone Warehouse</a> bring out a brand-new pay monthly offer.</p>
      <p>Expect to see offers on the likes of the iPad (2018) and the new iPad Mini (2019) and iPad Air (2019). Considering the standard iPad hasn't received a brand-new update this year, this could be a hot item and could drop to some incredible prices.</p>
      <p>Retailers have already realised that there's a lot of money to be made from discounting <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/headphones/120302/apple-airpods-2nd-generation">Apple AirPods</a>, and the brand new <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/reviews/122752/apple-watch-series-5">Apple Watch Series 5</a>. Both have received updates in 2019, and were some of the most sought after items last year.</p>
      <h4>4K TVs: LG, Sony, Philips, Samsung, Hisense, and more</h4>

      <p>There's no question that Black Friday TV deals are going to be massive this year. Whether you're after a state-of-the-art 8K masterpiece, or simply the most affordable 4K TV set you can find, Black Friday is the perfect time to look for a new set.</p>
      <p>Expect to see deals on Amazon, Currys, and John Lewis, who in particular have a great minimum five-year warranty policy on TVs.</p>
      <h4>Samsung: Galaxy S10, Galaxy Watch Active, Galaxy Tab</h4>

      <p>Samsung will also be looking to get in on the action, and with an update around the corner for its signature <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/smartphones/121284/samsung-galaxy-s10">Galaxy S10</a> range, expect these phones to drop even further during the Black Friday sales. The affordable Galaxy S10e is a <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/smartphones/120037/samsung-galaxy-s10e">PCMag Editor's Choice</a>, and certainly one to watch out for.</p>
      <p>Also expect to see some even better prices on the Galaxy Watch range, including the new Active 2, alongside Samsung's great range of <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/deals/122100/the-best-android-tablet-deals-in-the-uk">Android tablets</a>.</p>

      <p>Although you might not expect it, some of the biggest names in the TV and broadband industry do get involved in the November sales.</p>
      <p>Over the past couple of years, the likes of <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1257&amp;awinaffid=206129&amp;clickref=pcmagblackfriday&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vodafone.co.uk">Vodafone</a>, <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6399&amp;awinaffid=206129&amp;clickref=pcmagblackfriday&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virginmedia.com">Virgin Media</a>, <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3041&amp;awinaffid=206129&amp;clickref=blackfriday&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fhome.bt.com">BT</a>, <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=11005&amp;awinaffid=206129&amp;clickref=pcmagblackfriday&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sky.com">Sky</a>, <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3516&amp;awinaffid=206129&amp;clickref=pcmagblackfriday&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fee.co.uk">EE</a> and <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=2973&amp;awinaffid=206129&amp;clickref=pcmagblackfriday&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.plus.net">Plusnet</a> have all produced some kind of Black Friday sale or discount.</p>
      <p>BT is known to offer cheaper broadband deals, and throw in free access to BT Sport at no extra cost. Meanwhile, expect top providers such as Virgin Media and Sky to offer free-tech, or Black Friday bundles for TV and broadband.</p>

      <h4>Gaming: Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and more</h4>

      <p>2020 will be gracing us with a brand new set of consoles for <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/news-analysis/121230/microsoft-teases-xbox-project-scarlett-tons-of-games-keanu">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/sony-ps4-pro/120513/playstation-5-supports-8k-visuals-is-backwards-compatible">PlayStation</a>. As a result of this, Black Friday 2019 will be the last chance for retailers to sell current systems in large quantities. Last year Xbox One S dropped to less than £180, and could fall even lower in the upcoming sales. While we also expect the 4K capable consoles, the Xbox One X and the PS4 Pro, will recieve heavy discounts in the coming sales.</p>
      <p>Xbox UK releasing announced that Black Friday deals on the Xbox Store will start on November 22.</p>
      <p>The Nintendo Switch was one of the best-sellers last year on sites like <a href="https://www.dixonscarphone.com/en/news-and-media/press-releases/year/2018/currys-pc-world-sees-three-online-orders-per-second-as-black-friday-gets-underway">Currys PC World</a> and Amazon, so the <a href="https://uk.ign.com/articles/2019/09/26/nintendo-switch-lite-review">Switch Lite</a> adds more potential for deals. Currently, there's no word of another new Switch in 2020, but Black Friday may still offer some more offers on the system.</p>
