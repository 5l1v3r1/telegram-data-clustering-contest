      <p>Controversial new <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> documentary Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator, has gripped viewers as it details a string of racial, verbal and sexual abuse allegations against the yoga teacher.</p>
      <p>Bikram Choudhury, who launched Bikram Yoga in the 70s, became a star thanks to his craft and exercise classes, which he famously taught in just a pair of black Speedos.</p>
      <p>While the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/netflix-documentary-uncovers-shocking-racism-verbal-abuse-rape-claims-cult-like-bikram-yoga-founder-11188867/">documentary is seemingly damning</a>, the 75-year-old exercise teacher has continued to deny the accusations made against him, and still teaches yoga to this day to a dedicated fan base.</p>
      <p>Here’s where he is now, and why followers devoted to his practices refuse to let him go…</p>
      <h3>Where is Bikram Choudhury now?</h3>
      <p>Bikram Choudhury fled the US after losing a discrimination and harassment lawsuit against his former lawyer, Micki Jaffa-Bodden.</p>
      <p>She was awarded $7million (£5.4million) by a jury, which he did not pay.</p>

      <p>In January 2020, he is launching a 15-day tour of India with his followers, leading participants through Delhi through to Kolkata via Mumbai and Jodhpur.</p>

      <p>Those who take part will be put up in hotels with Bikram, and every morning will start with a two-hour yoga session with him, at a total cost of $3950 (£3000).</p>
      <p>It’s titled ‘Bikran’s India Legacy Tour’.</p>
      <p>Of the six women who have accused Bikram of sexual assault, four have been settled out of court.</p>
      <h3>What has Bikram Choudhury said about the documentary?</h3>
      <p>A representative for Bikram <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-22/bikram-choudhury-netflix-documentary-yoga-sexual-assault">told LA Times</a>: ‘Bikram Choudhury totally refutes all the allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment presented in the film and is deeply upset by the continued character assassination.</p>
      <p>‘Bikram believes that the concerted effort by money-motivated lawyers to proactively send letters to a database of all his clients, offering people free legal representation and the promise of $1 million insurance policy pay-outs is the primary motivation for this reputational catastrophe.</p>
      <p>‘Bikram believes the Netflix film is nothing more than a repetition of old material.’</p>
