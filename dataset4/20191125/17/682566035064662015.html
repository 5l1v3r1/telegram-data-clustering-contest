      <p>Cape Town - The <b>Lions</b> have confirmed that former Springbok prop <b>Jannie du Plessis </b>has joined the franchise for the upcoming<b> Super Rugby</b> season.</p>
      <p>He will be joined by<b> Carlu Sadie</b>, 22, who has moved to the Lions from the Stormers.Â </p>
      <p>Du Plessis, 37, who played 70 Tests for the Springboks between 2007 and 2015, has been on the books of French club Montpellier since 2015.</p>
      <p>Before that, he played 119 Super Rugby games for the Sharks between 2008 and 2015, having started his professional career at the Cheetahs in 2003.</p>
      <p>A medical doctor by trade, Du Plessis was largely expected to retire from rugby after his stay in France but a recent resurgence in form has breathed new life into his playing career.</p>
      <p>The Lions website quoted Du Plessis as saying that he is "ecstatic to see out his long and illustrious career at the Lions."</p>
      <p>And for all Du Plessis's experience, the Lions have also secured one of the best up-and-coming young tighthead props in the country.</p>
      <p>Sadie joined the Lions on a loan deal for the 2019 Super Rugby season, but was ordered to return to play for Western Province in the Currie Cup.</p>
      <p>In 2016 and 2017 he played for the South African Under-20 team and towards the end of this year, played for Stade Francais in France for a short period.</p>
      <p>The Lions open their 2020 Super Rugby campaign against the Jaguares in Buenos Aires on Saturday, February 1.</p>
