      <p>Kandi Burruss made her fans emotional when she shared a video on her IG account and YouTube channel as well. It’s a video from the hospital where all the family was present for the birth of her and Todd Tucker’s baby girl, Blaze Tucker. See the clip below.</p>

      <p>It’s also worth noting that Kandi created an Instagram page for the baby girl.</p>
      <p>Here’s how she captioned the video on her social media account: ‘Subscribe to my YouTube page KandiOnline &amp; don’t forget to click the button to receive notifications! The Real Housewives Of Atlanta Speak On It “Special Delivery” will start tonight at 9 pm est. I taped it while at the hospital with the family while we were waiting for @blazetucker.’</p>
      <p>Someone commented: ‘Congratulations to you and Todd. May God continue to bless you and your beautiful family. ❤️’</p>
      <p>Another follower said: ‘congratulations all the safe and healthy arrival of your beautiful girl Blaze,’ and one other commenter posted: ‘Your laugh be having me bugging up 😂 congratulations. ❤️’</p>
      <p>Someone else gushed over Kandi and called her an inspiration: ‘You are such a huge inspiration for me as a young producer and mom. I love watching you succeed and grow, congrats on your new daughter. I’m so happy for you guys! 💗’</p>
      <p>One follower is a bit freaked out: ‘It seems so generic seems cold, like waiting for a GPS package, I know Blaze will be loved, but I can’t wrap my brain around the concept. I wish the Tucker family well wishes.’</p>
      <p>Todd and Kandi revealed the birth of their baby girl.</p>
