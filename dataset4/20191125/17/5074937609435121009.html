      <h1>Residents in STMA and EKMA advised to use water judiciously</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:09:49+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:09</time> by <a rel="author">Seth Danquah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Daboase (W/R), November 25, GNA - Nana Yaw Barima-Barnie, Western Regional Communication Manager of the Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) has said that water has now become a scarce commodity in the Sekondi-Takoradi Metropolis, for that matter people should use water judiciously.</p>
      <p>He also advised the public against the use of treated water for the watering of lawns, gardens as well as the washing of vehicles.</p>
      <p>This cautioned was as a result of an acute water shortage in the Sekondi-Takoradi Metropolis (STMA) and the Effia-Kwesimintim Municipality (EKMA) of the Western Region since Monday, November 18.</p>
      <p>The water shortage was as a result of the breakdown of a transformer at the water company’s main treatment plant at Daboase in the Wassa East District.</p>
      <p>This is the second time this year that water supply in the two areas have been disrupted, the first one was in April this year, where water was rationed due to the low level of water in the Inchaban dam and the Daboase river which are the main sources of raw water to the treatment plant.</p>
      <p>The unexpected situation has left many to rely on boreholes and other unhygienic sources of water, a situation which could result in the outbreak of water-borne diseases.</p>
      <p>Nana Barimah-Barnie, who was speaking on the situation in an interview with the Ghana News Agency said his outfit has taken delivery of another transformer from the Barikese Treatment Plant in the Ashanti Region and has since installed it but his outfit is experiencing low voltage which is unable to power the plant.</p>
      <p>“This morning our technicians and technicians from the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) are going back to the plant to identify what is responsible for the low voltage and then rectify it, and once that is done production will start”, he stated. </p>
      <p>When the GNA asked how long would take to see water flowing through the taps, the communication manager said, “not until the problem is fixed nothing could be done” and appealed to residents to remain calm as the company work tirelessly to rectify the situation.</p>
      <p>On tanker services from the company, Nana Barima-Barnie said that would be a short-term measure to provide water to crucial areas but noted that it cannot be sustained due to the high cost of operating tankers and the unavailability of treated water at the site.</p>
      <p>He also attributed the frequent water shortage in the metropolis to the unstable power supply to the treatment plant, coupled with the regular shutdowns for routine maintenance of the plant.</p>
