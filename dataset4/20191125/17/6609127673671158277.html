        <b>GLASGOW MSP John Mason has lodged a motion in parliament urging for public trust in HMRC over the Rangers tax row.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The SNP politician addressed the recent story reported by <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4952016/taxman-50m-blunder-rangers/">The Times</a> claiming that the tax authorities were set to wipe out as much as £50million from a tax bill owed by <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers'</a> old operating company after a "multimillion-pound blunder".</p>

      <p>Former Ibrox chairman John McClelland has said the club wouldn't have plunged into liquidation in 2012 if the lower bill reported had been the figure claimed before Craig Whyte bought the club for £1.</p>
      <p>HMRC chief <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4958979/rangers-tax-hmrc-letter-times/">Jim Harra personally sent a letter to the editor of The Times Scotland</a> over "inaccurate and partial reporting" of the tax issues.</p>
      <p>But the tax authority <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4956486/rangers-tax-ebt-hmrc/">is adamant it has not made any mistakes</a> in how they calculated Gers' tax liabilities</p>
      <p>And now Mr Mason has said that trust in the tax system is "paramount".</p>
      <p>His motion read: "That the Parliament notes the recent publication by The Times, which stated that Rangers FC’s insolvency was the result of an HMRC overestimation of taxes owed by £50 million; understands that HMRC has stated that no such mistakes were made and that it won its case against Rangers’ tax avoidance scheme in the Supreme Court; recognises that HMRC has also stated that "inaccurate and partial reporting only serves to undermine public trust in the tax system", and considers that public trust in the tax system is paramount given the importance of taxation for the provision of public services and ensuring a fairer and more progressive Scotland."</p>
      <p>Rangers then broke their silence over the affair to admit to "concerns" at suggestions HMRC got their sums wrong.</p>
      <p>An Ibrox spokesperson said: "The Times story, if it is shown to be accurate, throws up a great many questions and is a cause for concern.</p>
      <p>"Rangers will take time to consider any courses of action which may become feasible."</p>
      <p>Earlier this year Mr Mason sparked outrage by <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4262415/snp-nats-john-mason-celtic-boys-club-sex-abuse-rangers-tax-dodge/">comparing the Celtic Boys Club sex abuse scandal to Rangers avoiding tax. </a></p>
      <p>The politician suggested there were “parallels” between beasts preying on children and the Ibrox side keeping cash from public coffers.</p>
      <p>He wrote in an email to a voter: “In both cases young people are suffering. In the one children are suffering directly at the hands of child abusers.</p>
      <p>“In the other very rich people are not paying the tax due which means schools and hospitals get less money than they need.</p>
      <p>"I do accept they are different types of crimes, but they are both crimes with real victims, usually the most vulnerable in our society.”</p>
