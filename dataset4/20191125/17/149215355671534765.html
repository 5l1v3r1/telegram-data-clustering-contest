      <p>Even as countries rush to cap or limit their emissions, greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere have reached a record high — again.</p>
      <p>The United Nations' World Meteorological Organization <a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/greenhouse-gas-concentrations-atmosphere-reach-yet-another-high">said</a> Monday that globally averaged concentrations of carbon dioxide reached a record-breaking 407.8 parts per million in 2018.

      <p>Executive Director of the U.N. Environment Program Inger Andersen <a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/greenhouse-gas-concentrations-atmosphere-reach-yet-another-high">said</a> the WMO's findings "point us in a clear direction" and that "we face a stark choice" to "set in motion the radical transformations we need now" or "face the consequences" of climate change. A report from the UNEP on the emissions gap will be released Tuesday.
