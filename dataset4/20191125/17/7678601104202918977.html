      <p>Indonesia has won a silver medal at the 2019 Silk Road international horseback archery competition in Alborz, Iran.</p>
      <p>Twenty-two countries participated in the competition, held from Nov. 22 to 24, all of which are members of the World Horseback Archery Federation (WHAF), which operates under UNESCO.</p>
      <p>The Indonesia Horseback Archery Association (KPBI) sent two athletes to compete, Kharisma Zaky and Najib Hardika, both of whom are members of KPBIâ€™s West Sumatra chapter.</p>
      <p>The competition was split into three main mounted archery categories, namely Hungarian style, Korean style double shoot and Tabla Turki.</p>
      <p>Despite having to endure extreme cold in the arena, Kharisma finished second in the Hungarian style event.</p>
      <p>"Kharisma was shivering during the tournament. However, despite the cold temperatures and only 5 meters of visibility, Kharisma performed well," KPBI secretary-general Sunaryo Adhiatmoko said in a statement released by Indonesian Embassy in Tehran.</p>
      <p>Kharisma finished behind winner Valentin Lokatos of Hungary and ahead of Sergei Odinkov of Russia.<br/><br/>Kharisma attributed his success to the Indonesia team's solid teamwork and the discipline and patience he had learned training with the KPBI.<br/><br/>KPBI chairman Alda Amtha said the competition was the second horseback archery event Indonesia had attended after participating in a similar competition in South Korea.
