      <h1>Dollar hits 1-week high vs yen as risk sentiment improves</h1>

      <p>NEW YORK — Positive news on the Sino-U.S. trade front lifted market sentiment on Monday, driving the U.S. dollar to a one-week high against the safe-haven yen, while the British pound rose as election polls over the weekend continued to show a sizeable lead for the Conservative party.</p>
      <p>China and the United States are very close to a “phase one” trade deal, the Global Times, a tabloid run by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, said on Monday, discounting “negative” media reports.</p>
      <p>Against the yen, which tends to strengthen during times of geopolitical or financial stress due to Japan’s standing as the world’s biggest creditor, the dollar was 0.28% higher at 108.94 yen, a 1-week high.</p>
      <p>Market sentiment was also helped by news over the weekend that China was seeking to raise substantially the upper limits for intellectual property violation fines.</p>
      <p>Optimism that a trade deal will be reached to end the damaging U.S-China trade war boosted risk appetite and reduced demand for safe-haven bonds.</p>
      <p>“It seems there’s now cause for optimism again after reports that China is open to tightening rules on intellectual property, with Chinese state media claiming a deal is now close,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, we’ve been here so many times before I’m struggling to get particularly excited,” Erlam added.</p>
      <p>Despite the weakness on Monday, the safe-haven yen was likely to remain in demand, Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, said in a note.</p>
      <p>“Constructive market sentiment is based on fragile foundations; it would appear and we expect the JPY, for example, to remain well-supported on dips while trade tensions simmer,” Osborne said.</p>
      <p>The dollar index, which compares the dollar against six major currencies, was up 0.09% at 98.355.</p>
      <p>The dollar has been well-supported in recent weeks as continued trade-related tensions led investors to back the greenback. Investors view the United States relatively well-positioned to weather a full-blown trade war should there be one.</p>
      <p>Speculators raised net long bets on the dollar to a five-week high in the week to Nov. 19, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed.</p>
      <p>Sterling climbed back above $1.29 on Monday, drifting further from recent lows, as polls continued to show the ruling Conservatives as runaway favorites to win the Dec. 12 election with a pledge to implement Brexit and halt 3-1/2 years of political uncertainty.</p>
      <p>The pound was 0.36% higher against the U.S. dollar.</p>
