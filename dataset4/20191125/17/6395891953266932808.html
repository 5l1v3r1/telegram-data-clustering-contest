      <p><b>WASHINGTONÂ (AP)</b> - Melania Trump has kicked off the holiday season in the nation's capital by accepting delivery of the official White House Christmas tree.</p>
      <p>A horse-drawn carriage delivered the tree to the front door of the White House on Monday as members of a military band played Christmas music. The first lady walked around the carriage and inspected the tree, which will become the centerpiece of Christmas in the White House Blue Room.</p>
      <p>The tree came from Mahantongo Valley Farms in Pitman, Pennsylvania. Owner Larry Snyder earned the honor of presenting the White House a tree from his farm after winning an annual contest held by the National Christmas Tree Association.</p>
      <p>White House officials chose the tree weeks ago during a visit to Snyder's farm.</p>
