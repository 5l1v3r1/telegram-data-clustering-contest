      <p>Another heart-wrenching incident has emerged from Mumbai where a three-year-old female dog was mercilessly beaten to death by a security guard in the Phoolpada area of Virar (east).</p>
      <p>Her fault? She took shelter from the rain at the apartment and was sleeping there.</p>
      <p>One of the security guards at the apartment, identified as Rakesh Sahani, allegedly hit her repeatedly with a wooden pole while she was sleeping.</p>
      <p>The barbaric act was caught on the CCTV camera installed at the apartment and the dog, named Sweety, could be seen wriggling in pain.</p>
      <p>This comes after a similar incident, where a dog named Lucky was killed by a security guard, outraged Mumbaikars. Even the Bollywood fraternity had come out demanding punishment for the culprit.</p>
      <p>The dog was rushed to the hospital. However, she succumbed to the injuries.</p>
      <p>A case has been lodged against the accused, who has gone missing since the incident came to the public eye.</p>
      <p>One of the reasons many cited for the increasing number of animal cruelty cases is the negligible penalty for those found guilty.</p>
