          <b>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is set to allow Irish youngster Caoimhin Kelleher and teammate Rhian Brewster to leave the club on loan in January.</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>However, the Reds boss will seek assurances that both players will get the game-time they need at any new club.</p>
      <p>Both Kelleher and Brewster played in the Reds' two Carabao Cup victories this season, featuring for the full 90 minutes of the 2-0 win at Milton Keynes Dons and the penalty shootout victory over Arsenal after a crazy 5-5 draw at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Brewster netted his spot-kick against the Gunners, with Cork native Kelleher's save from Dani Ceballos also proving crucial.</p>
      <p>Both are likely to be leaned on heavily when a shadow Reds squad goes to Aston Villa for the quarter-final on December 17, with the vast majority of Klopp's senior side in Qatar for the Club World Cup semi-final a day later.</p>
      <p>The pair could also be involved against Red Bull Salzburg in the Champions League a week earlier if the Reds beat Napoli this week to secure qualification for the last 16.</p>
      <p>Nineteen-year-old forward Brewster has been forced to remain patient for his chance in the Reds first team due to injuries, while the likes of Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane and Divock Origi are clearly ahead of him in the pecking order.</p>
      <p>He has also been an unused substitute in the Premier League on three occasions.</p>

      <p>The <b><i><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpools-plan-rhian-brewster-revealed-17310894">Liverpool Echo</a></i></b> report that any deal for Brewster would centre around a guarantee of game-time for the forward, with Championship sides Swansea and Leeds both showing an interest, as well as Crystal Palace and Aston Villa in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Game-time would also be a strong consideration for goalkeeper Kelleher, who is reportedly wanted by Championship promotion hopefuls Preston North End.</p>
      <p>The Irish shotstopper made his Anfield debut in the League Cup clash against Arsenal and speaking after the game <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/football/penalty-hero-caoimhin-kelleher-341745"><b><i>the youngster described the 'surreal' feeling of stepping up to become Liverpool's penalty hero.</i></b></a></p>
      <p>“As soon as the final whistle went, all the focus was on trying to save in the shootout,” Kelleher said.</p>
      <p>“Some of the lads and the coaches said to me, ‘You’ve nothing to lose, just try to be the hero.’ And luckily I did it in the end.</p>
      <p>“It was a bit of a whirlwind. I’m obviously happy but it’s just hard to sum it up at the moment. It has all gone by quite quickly. It’s just unreal, to be honest.”</p>
