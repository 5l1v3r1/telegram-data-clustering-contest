      <p>Feyenoord have been banned from selling tickets to their fans for next month's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> game at Porto.</p>
      <p>The punishment follows disturbances during a previous clash against Young Boys in Basel.</p>
      <p>UEFA have fined the club €50,000 due to the behaviour of their supporters during the 2-0 defeat in Switzerland last month and an additional €5000 for "acts of damage".</p>
      <p>Crowd disturbance charges were also levelled at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/feyenoord">Feyenoord</a> after their supporters threw objects and set off fireworks.</p>
      <p>UEFA confirmed they'd taken action via a statement on Monday.</p>
