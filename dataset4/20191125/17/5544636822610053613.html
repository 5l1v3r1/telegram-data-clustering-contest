      <p>Controversial Nollywood screen diva, <a href="http://concienews.global/entertainment/">Tonto Dikeh</a> and popular blogger, Stella Dimokokorkus have engaged in a war of words on Instagram, as the latter alleged that the former owes her two hundred thousand Naira.</p>
      <p><a href="http://concisenews.global/">Concise News</a> understands that Tonto had in a post last week threatened to call out a blogger begging her for money.</p>
      <p>On the same day in an Instagram post, Dimokokorkus said “The face you make when you are waiting for them to call you out and you can’t wait anymore. First and foremost I don’t beg for money but I can beg you to help someone.”</p>
      <p>But in series of Instagram posts on Monday, November 25, Dimokokorkus and Tonto called each other out on different allegations.</p>
      <p>Dimokokorkus claimed that Tonto owes her two hundred thousand Naira, saying “Hmmm you are owing me 200k for [the] bad press I refused to do on Toyin.</p>
      <p>“I turned it good. I leave the money for u ooh. How can I drag money with u when u have not paid Toyin’s 15K dollars?</p>
      <p>“After Gbenshing Toyin’s ex when they were still married. Did you drink blood in Ibadan or not at a Babalawo’s place?</p>
      <p>“See Tonto you are a nice person but very evil and malicious when you are fighting someone. I don’t have receipts. If you have please post.”</p>
