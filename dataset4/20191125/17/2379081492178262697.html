      <h1>Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade deal ‘significant value’ to Toronto Dominion — but only if it sells</h1>
      <h2>TD will get 13.4% stake in Schwab worth about $8.2 billion</h2>

      <p>Toronto-Dominion Bank sees “significant value” from Charles Schwab Corp.’s purchase of TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. — but that will only be realized if the Canadian lender opts to unload its minority stake in the combined entity, according to one analyst.</p>
      <p><a href="https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/charles-schwab-to-buy-td-ameritrade-extending-brokerage-industry-sway">Charles Schwab agreed Monday</a> to buy the U.S. discount broker that’s 43 per cent owned by Toronto-Dominion in a stock deal valued at US$26 billion. The Canadian lender said it supports the transaction, and will exchange its ownership stake for a 13.4 per cent stake in San Francisco-based Schwab. Toronto-Dominion said in a statement that it expects to record a “sizeable” revaluation gain when the deal closes next year.</p>
      <p>“There is significant value being created by this combination — value that in TD’s case will only surface if or when the bank decides to monetize its stake,” CIBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Sedran said in a note to clients, adding that the deal will have a “minor near-term impact” for the bank.</p>
      <p>As part of the deal, Toronto-Dominion will get two seats on Schwab’s board of directors and the firms agreed to a revised insured deposit account agreement that gives the Toronto-based lender a continued earnings stream. Currently, Omaha-based TD Ameritrade has a so-called sweep agreement that shifts its deposits to Toronto-Dominion’s balance sheet for a service fee. Starting July 2021, those deposit accounts, which were US$103 billion as of July 31, can be reduced at Schwab’s option by up to US$10 billion a year, with a floor of US$50 billion. The fee under the 10-year agreement will be set at 15 basis points on closing.</p>
      <p>The earnings and capital plusses and minuses from the deal more or less balance each other out from Toronto-Dominion’s perspective, according to Sedran. The deal is “modestly accretive” to adjusted earnings in the second and third year, given the anticipated expense synergies, he said.</p>
      <p>Toronto-Dominion rose 0.5 per cent to $77.43 in Toronto. The bank’s 13 per cent stake in Schwab would be worth about US$8.2 billion based on the current share price for the broker.</p>
