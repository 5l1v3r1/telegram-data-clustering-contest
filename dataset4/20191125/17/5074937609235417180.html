      <p>Tema, Nov. 25, GNA – The Forestry Commission, Toyota Ghana Limited, adb Bank, and Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) have committed to support the 2019/2020 National Bushfire Prevention Campaign, which will be launched on December 13, at Adaklu Anfoe in the Volta Region.</p>
      <p>The adb Bank donated GH¢10,000.00; Forestry Commission GH¢20,000.00; COCOBOD donated GH¢45,000.00; and Toyata Ghana Limited donated 100 Wellington, 100 pieces of Nose Guards and 100 pieces of Torchlights.   </p>
      <p>The 2019/2020 Bushfire Prevention Campaign is on the general theme: “My Environment, My Life: Stop Bushfires Now! Is under the auspices of the Ghana National Fire Service (GNFS).</p>
      <p>The Deputy Chief Fire Officer (DCFO), Semekor Kwaku Fiadzo, who is the chairman of the National Bushfire Campaign Planning Committee commended the institutions for the generous support towards the prevention of Bushfires.</p>
      <p>DCFO Fiadzo appealed to the other companies yet to respond to the national call to support the 2019/2020 Bushfire Prevention Campaign to come forward and join forces with the GNFS through their donation to educate the public to reduce incidence of bushfires.</p>
      <p>He said the Bushfire Prevention Campaign aimed at mobilising and educating the public to understand the dangers of illegal fires, and how to prevent it “we need to work together to reduce bush fires to the barest minimum”.</p>
      <p>DCFO Fiadzo said as part of the public education, Fire Volunteers would be mobilise and trained to assist farmers to adopt good farming practices that would not cause any unwanted fires that could wipe away their investments.</p>
      <p>"Human activities like hunting for bush meat through the setting of fire in the bush has led to the continuous devastation of the forest, hence the depletion of the forest cover which leads to rainfall," he added.</p>
      <p>The DCFO, noted that uncalled-for destruction of the vegetation by bushfires negatively impacted the sustainability of the environment, emphasising the need for stringent measures to address the challenge, such as the training of more volunteers on bush fires prevention.</p>
      <p>He said fire prevention was a shared responsibility, therefore the need for the public to obey fire regulations to help the country record low fire incidents in the coming years.</p>
      <p>On why Adaklu Anfoe was chosen as the venue for the national launch, DCFO Fiadzo explained that statistics on bushfire pointed to the fact that the district was bushfire proned.</p>
      <p>He stated that the anti-Bushfire campaign was to create awareness on how best to suppress bushfires as a step to eradicating them completely.</p>
      <p>He added the theme was chosen due to the need to protect the environment from bushfires in order to sustain farming and Government’s Flagship Programme of Planting for Food and Jobs</p>
