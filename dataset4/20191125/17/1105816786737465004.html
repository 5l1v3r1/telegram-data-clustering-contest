      <h1>Pakistani cricketers win hearts by dining with hospitable Indian cabby</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:30:12+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/7761/news-2/" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>In a heartwarming series of events, Pakistani cricketers shared their dinner table with an Indian cab driver after he refused to accept the taxi fare from the players in Brisbane, Australia.</p>
      <p>The gesture by the cricketers — Shaheen Shah Afridi, Yasir Shah and Naseem Shah among others —  was widely lauded on social media after the video of <i>ABC radio</i> presenter Alison Mitchell, in which she narrated the story about the generosity of Pakistani players to former Aussie pacer Mitchell Johnson, went viral on Monday.</p>

      <p>Mitchell came to know about the incident after she travelled with the same taxi driver, who drove her to the Gabba stadium in Brisbane for the first Test between Australia and Pakistan.</p>

      <p>During the ride, she came to know about the players, who were picked up from their hotel in Brisbane and were taken to an Indian restaurant for dinner — where they later treated the cab driver as he refused to charge them for the ride.</p>

      <p>Earlier on Sunday, Pakistan was beaten by an innings and five runs on the fourth day of the first Test of the two-match series to take a 1-0 lead.</p>
      <p>Babar Azam (104) slammed his second Test ton while Mohammad Rizwan contributed 95 runs to stall Australia’s march to victory but they failed to make the hosts bat again, getting bundled out for 335 second time around.</p>
