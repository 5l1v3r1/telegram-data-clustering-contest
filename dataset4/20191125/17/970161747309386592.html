      <p>A mum has set up a food bank in her own home to help people vulnerable people in Leicester.</p>
      <p>Emma Marsh, 37, began the heartwarming project in her Earl Shilton home several years ago, after working with numerous charities such as Help the Homeless.</p>
      <p>Through her work, the mum became concerned that many young families and working parents were struggling to get hold of vouchers to use at food banks.</p>
      <p>To get hold of a voucher, a person often needs to be referred from a GP or the Citizens Advice Bureau, meaning many can’t access banks and continue to struggle.</p>
      <p>Emma, who has always kept sleeping bags and other essentials in the boot of her car, decided to set up her own food bank at her home so families can drop by instead of being referred.</p>

      <p>‘I know that there are loads of food banks in Leicester but for a lot of them people need referrals and vouchers so I decided to do it from home. It’s heartbreaking seeing people struggle,’ she said.</p>

      <p>Thanks to help from her children and generous donations from locals, Emma managed to fill hundreds of shoe boxes to give back to the community over Christmas last year.</p>
      <p>After last December’s positive response, the self-employed mum wants to encourage even more to donate toys, clothes, and food in the run-up to this festive season.</p>
      <p>Emma said she wants to ‘reach people who will struggle over the Christmas period, especially those whose families are on low incomes or children who would usually get free school meals’.</p>
      <p>Through word-of-mouth and social media, Emma has been able to reach hundreds of people and receives regular calls from people in need.</p>
      <p>Emma often spends her own money to donate products that others haven’t, such as nappies and sanitary products, adding: ‘Even if it just saves someone twenty pounds it’s worth it’.</p>

      <p>The mother, who accepts donations to her home or picks them up herself, added: ‘Even if someone just wants to donate one jar of pasta sauce I will happily go to pick it up because that person has made an effort to help’.</p>
      <p>As part of the donations this year, she plans to include Christmas crackers and other festive treats and is now calling for anyone who can help to donate.</p>
      <p>She thanked everyone that has donated so far, adding: ‘It just shows that sometimes a little bit of kindness really goes far’.</p>
