      <h1>Scott Williams called up to Wales squad as injury cover after Willis Halaholo blow</h1>
      <h2>The Ospreys centre had initially missed out on selection in Wayne Pivac's squad</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:51:48+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:51</time> by <a rel="author">Ben James</a></address>
      <p>Scott Williams is training with the Wales team as injury cover ahead of their clash with the Barbarians this weekend.</p>
      <p>The Ospreys centre was a notable absentee for Saturday's clash after initially missing out on selection in new coach Wayne Pivac's first 35-man squad.</p>
      <p>But he is now training with Pivac's charges after new Wales squad member Willis Halaholo suffered a knee injury during the region's Challenge Cup clash with Leicester Tigers.</p>
      <p>Auckland-born Halaholo would have been in line to make his first appearance for Wales since qualifying through residency - with Owen Watkin and Hadleigh Parkes the only other centres named in the original squad.</p>
      <p>And while there has been no update on the extent of Halaholo's injury, it seems unlikely that he will make his Wales debut this weekend.</p>

      <p>Either way, Pivac and his new coaching ticket have seen fit to call on the experience of 58-cap international Williams as cover.</p>
      <p>The centre took part in training with Wales on Monday at their Vale of Glamorgan HQ.</p>
      <p>Former Scarlet Williams, who won a PRO12 title with Pivac during his time at the Llanelli-based region, missed out on World Cup selection after a late bid to prove his fitness from a back injury.</p>
