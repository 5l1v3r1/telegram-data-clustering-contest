      <p>The component parts of a bomb were picked up by a child in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Newry">Newry</a>, the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Police+Service+of+Northern+Ireland">Police Service of Northern Ireland</a> (PSNI) has said.</p>
      <p>A suspicious object found in the Violet Hill Avenue area of the city on Sunday sparked a 24-hour security alert, which ended on Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The PSNI said British army bomb disposal experts carried out a controlled explosion on what are believed to be the component parts for an explosive device.</p>
      <p>A number of items were taken away for forensic examination.</p>
      <p>“When such items are left in a public area they can be innocently handled by anyone,” said Superintendent Jane Humphries.</p>
      <p>“On this occasion it was picked up by a child.”</p>
      <p>She appealed for anyone with information to contact police on 101.</p>
