      <p>He's quoted by the Daily Star newspaper as saying: "It was verbal rather than physical, but once one started a few of them would join in.</p>
      <p>"It was jealousy more than anything else. I was doing something with my life and they were just hanging around the street corners getting hammered every week.</p>
      <p>"At one stage my dad was thinking of pulling me out of the school. But I told him I didn't want to, because if I left then they'd have won."</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old soap star - who first appeared on the cobbles in 2000 - always wanted to be a performer, and took up dancing from the age of eight, as well as busking to earn some extra money as a youngster.</p>
      <p>He has been open in the past about overcome bullying, and he previously urged his fans to follow their dreams rather than letting people "get you down".</p>

      <p>He said: "Always stick to your dreams. I was bullied because I was different and wanted to be an actor.</p>
      <p>"If you are being bullied don't let it get you down because bullies quickly become bored and move on, and speak to an adult you trust."</p>
