      <p>Faced by a political deadlock and indictment on corruption charges, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems to be running out of options.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu who has refused to step down has agreed to elections for the leadership of his Likud party. </p>
      <p>Israeli media reported the Likud primary would be held in six weeks. A party spokesman was not reachable to confirm the timeline.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu is the current chair of his party.</p>
      <p>Pressure has been mounting on Israel's longest-serving PM after he was indicted on a series of charges including bribery.</p>
      <p>While Netanyahu has vowed to fight against the charges, some in his party feel that he has been denting the image of Likud.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu's position in the party will likely be challenged. </p>
      <p>Israel's Supreme Court dismissed a petition by a watchdog group to force Netanyahu to step aside.</p>
      <p>But a more pressing issue is the government formation or else Israel will head to its third general election in less than a year.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu's rival Benny Gantz has proposed the formation of a unity govt in which Gantz will serve as the Prime Minister for 2 years &amp; Netanyahu will become the Prime Minister for the remaining 2 years of the government. This of course, if Netanyahu is not forced to take a leave of absence.</p>
      <p>Gantz's offer will end in 17 days after which a third election is inevitable. However, Netanyahu has so far shown little interest in the former army chief's offer.</p>
