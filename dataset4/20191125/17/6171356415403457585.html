      <p>As you're surfing <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/19/black-friday-2019/">Black Friday deals</a> you might be considering how secure all those passwords you're entering are. If you're particularly concerned, Google's <a href="https://support.google.com/titansecuritykey/answer/9115487">Titan security keys</a> can beef up your accounts' security. Whether you're looking to stock up on keys or you've just been curious about trying one, now wouldn't be a bad time to give it a go: Google is offering <a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/titan_security_key">15% off their entire Titan range</a> from now until December 6th of this year.</p>
      <p>Titan security keys add an extra level of protection to your accounts, being essentially a heavy-duty, physical version of two-factor authentication. After entering your password you'll be prompted to insert your key and connect to complete your log-in. The keys should work with any accounts tied to <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/members/">FIDO-certified services</a>.</p>
