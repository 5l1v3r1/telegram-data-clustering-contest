      <p>Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) OBC wing chairman Sumesh Achuthan has filed a complaint to the District Police Chief demanding that POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act be invoked against Union Minister of State for External Affairs V.

      <p>They protested by drawing, writing and shouting slogans against the government.</p>
