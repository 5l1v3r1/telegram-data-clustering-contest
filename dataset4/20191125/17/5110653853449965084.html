      <h1>Yahoo DFS Picks Week 13: Daily fantasy football lineup advice for GPP tournaments</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:49:32+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:49</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>Our Week 13 Yahoo daily fantasy football GPP lineup is relying on two Jets as our main NFL DFS stack. Taking a bit of a value stack allows us to pay up for three stud running backs, including Christian McCaffrey, that provide a great floor. Add two Jaguars' pass catchers against the Buccaneers, and this lineup could have you near the top of tournament leaderboards come Sunday.</p>
      <p>We had one of our best lineups of the season in Week 12. The Baker Mayfield and Odell Beckham Jr. stack was a great start. Paying up for Christian McCaffrey worked out wonderfully, as well, and Robby Anderson found the end zone while the Devin Singletary and Bills D/ST stack performed, too. If only Russell Wilson hadn't missed Jacob Hollister on one of the easiest passes he'll have to make all season, which would've been a touchdown, then we would've been even better.</p>

      <h3>NFL DFS Week 13: Yahoo GPP Lineup Picks</h3>
      <p><b>QB Sam Darnold, Jets @ Bengals ($28). </b>Darnold has proven in consecutive weeks that if you put him up against a bad defense, he can shred it. Enter the winless Bengals. Thisshould be another big week for Darnold.</p>
      <p><b>RB Josh Jacobs, Raiders @ Chiefs ($33). </b>Kansas City has allowed more fantasy points per game to running backs than any other team, making Jacobs' price so worth it for a high volume and high production game.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WEEK 13 PPR RANKINGS: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-13-fantasy-ppr-rb-rankings-running-back-sleepers/17al9q8kz6v1k19wh8otlz2we2">Running back</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-13-ppr-rankings-wr-fantasy-football-wide-receiver-sleepers/wgsxmq892kf91l9h2x825a4bq">Wide receiver</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-13-fantasy-ppr-rankings-tight-end-sleepers-te/zqdpejo0fsq018mp8i6iep2mk">Tight end</a></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>RB Christian McCaffrey, Panthers vs. Redskins ($42). </b>Paying up for McCaffrey just continues to seem like the only logical move when he produces every single time he takes the field. We have no worries at all about the Redskins slowing him down.</p>
      <p><b>WR DJ Chark, Jaguars vs. Buccaneers ($26). </b>Tampa Bay has allowed four more fantasypoints per game to WRs more than any other team. Nick Foles hasn't inspired confidence, yet this feels like an opportunity for the Jags to get back on the right track.</p>
      <p><b>WR Robby Anderson, Jets @ Bengals ($12). </b>Getting Anderson at this price after two-straight weeks with scores and the deep-ball ability he has is an absolute steal. Jamison Crowder is $5 more despite last week's dud, so Anderson is the obvious tournament stack with Darnold.</p>
      <p><b>WR Jakobi Meyers, Patriots @ Texans ($10). </b>This is my play if Mohamed Sanu (ankle)<i>and </i>Phillip Dorsett (concussion) remain out. That scenario got Meyers nine targets in Week 12, so his minimum price would be great. If at least one of them is playing, I'd pivot to $10Kelvin Harmon<b> </b>of Washington, who's seen six targets each of the past two weeks and gets a great matchup in Carolina.</p>
      <p><b>TE Nick O'Leary, Jaguars vs. Buccaneers ($10). </b>In addition to being bad against receivers, the Bucs are terrible against tight ends. O'Leary had four catches in Week 12 and should be the one to benefit -- even if they're garbage-time catches, they count just the same.</p>
      <p><b>FLEX Melvin Gordon, Chargers @ Broncos ($22). </b>This is more a volume play than a matchup one. Having three top-tier running backs creates an awesome floor-ceiling combo to build on in this GPP lineup, so even if one of the receivers doesn't produce, we'll still be in play to cash.</p>
      <p><b>D/ST Philadelphia Eagles @ Dolphins ($17). </b>Ryan Fitzpatrick helps the Dolphins put up points, but he also turns the ball over a ton, and they still seem intent on giving the ball to the human embodiment of ineffiency, Kalen Ballage. Philly is a bargain as the beneficiary of all that.</p>
