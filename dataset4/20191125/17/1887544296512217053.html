      <p>REGINA - Canada's agriculture minister is urging Canadian National Railway Co. and its workers to reach a deal to alleviate the impact the ongoing strike is having on farmers.</p>
      <p>Marie-Claude Bibeau delivered remarks at the Canadian Western Agribition show in Regina, where she also met with producers.</p>
      <p>She says she's heard from farmers about how the strike is affecting them.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe has called on the federal government to intervene in the strike and Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has requested Parliament be recalled to pass back-to-work legislation.</p>
      <p>Moe has said the strike cannot drag on because it will mean job losses in agriculture.</p>
      <p>More than 3,000 CN rail workers have been off work since early last week.</p>
