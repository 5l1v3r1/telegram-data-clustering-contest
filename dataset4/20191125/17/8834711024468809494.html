      <p>JOHANNESBURG – Dozens of people gathered at Rocklands Beach on Monday in Sea Point where rescuers were searching for three teenagers who were swept out to sea.</p>
      <p>The body of a 15-year-old boy was recovered on Sunday, however, there was no sign of the other three. The group had gone for a swim but were hit by a large wave.</p>
      <p>The National Sea Rescue Institute’s (NSRI) spokesperson Craig Lambinon said: “We do also have family members on the scene and police trauma counsellors assisting them.
