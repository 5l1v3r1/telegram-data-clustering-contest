        <b>Mohammed Sani-Omolori, clerk of the national assembly, has asked Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi, to mark his victory at the polls with a sober reflection, not merry making.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bello, candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), defeated Musa Wada, his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) rival, in the last goverorship election.</p>
      <p>In a congratulatory message to the message to the governor on Monday, Sani-Omolori asked Bello to be more “humane and God-fearing.”</p>
      <p>“On occasions like this, it is the practice to mark with a lot of merry-making, the achievement of successes,” he said.</p>
      <p>“But for me, it should be an occasion for sober reflections on our yesterday that gave chance to today and therefore, positively plan for a better and greater tomorrow.</p>
      <p>“In managing successes, which’ Is a more difficult task than its attainment, the last four years should serve as a lesson to move onto the coming months with renewed fear of Almighty Allah SWT and indeed, a greater resolve to be just, fair, humane and sober while rededicating your efforts towards serving our people better.</p>
      <p>“Your Excellency, my brother, the burden of leadership is heavy. I pray for Allah’s guidance and protection in the months and years ahead. Best wishes.”</p>
