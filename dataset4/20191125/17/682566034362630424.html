      <p>Prague - World number two<b> Karolina Pliskova</b> said Monday she had hired Venezuelan coach Daniel Vallverdu to replace Spaniard Conchita Martinez whom she had sacked earlier this month.</p>
      <p>"He was one of my priorities from the start," Pliskova said on her website.</p>
      <p>Vallverdu, 33, previously worked with Andy Murray from 2010 to 2014 and was part of the Ivan Lendl-led team that helped the Scot to win Olympic gold and the US Open in 2012 as well as Wimbledon in 2013.</p>
      <p>Vallverdu also worked with Thomas Berdych and Grigor Dimitrov and this year joined Magnus Norman's team coaching Stan Wawrinka.</p>
      <p>"He's had fantastic results, he understands tennis like few others and I am convinced he has a lot to offer to me," added the 27-year-old Czech who is still seeking her maiden Grand Slam title.</p>
      <p>Pliskova said former Ukraine Fed Cup player Olga Savchuk had also joined her team ahead of a training camp in Tenerife and her first 2020 tournament in Brisbane where she will defend the title.</p>
      <p>Pliskova, the 2016 US Open finalist, parted ways with 1994 Wimbledon champion Martinez after a season that saw her win four WTA tournaments and reach the semi-finals at the Australian Open and the WTA Finals.</p>
