        <b>A new Amazon Prime show starring Al Pacino features a group of “diverse” vigilantes who hunt down and kill “Nazis,” some of whom are depicted wearing red MAGA-style hats.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Called Hunters, the trailer for the show, which is set in New York in 1977, is dominated by Pacino’s character, a Nazi-hunting Jewish ringleader named Meyer Offerman who justifies the killings by asserting, “This is not murder, This is mitzvah.”</p>
      <p>“For eons, people like us have been degraded and exterminated. But no more,” says Pacino as images of Jews and black people are shown.</p>
      <p>The clips featured in the trailer portray numerous acts of violence against the “Nazis,” including stabbings, a woman being punched in the face and a car containing the victims being blown up.</p>

      <p>According to People, the vigilante group, described as “diverse,” discovers that “hundreds of escaped Nazis are living in America” and then “set out on a bloody quest for revenge and justice.”</p>
      <p>The plot of the show appears to bear numerous similarities to Jason Blum’s The Hunt, a horror movie that centered around a group of liberals who hunt down red state conservatives.</p>
      <p>The release of The Hunt was postponed following criticism from President Trump and the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton.</p>
