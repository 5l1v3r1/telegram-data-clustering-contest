      <p>For most parents, <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2018/06/why-picture-books-are-perfect-bedtime-stories">sharing a nighttime story with their child</a> is a precious and important time, but sometimes the tucking-in duties fall to baby sitters and other family members. The latest Google Home update adds a new “My Storytime” feature that lets parents record stories and other messages for their children on those occasions when the parents aren’t home for bedtime.</p>

      <p>Google Home and other Google Assistant-powered devices have other bedtime and wake-up-related apps that include messages from popular cartoon or movie characters, but My Storytime is designed to ease the difficulties of long-distance parenting. It was created with parents who work at night or travel often, such as members of the military, so they can stay in contact and play an active roll in their kids’ daily lives and routines. Here’s how it works:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to the <a href="https://mystorytime.com/">My Storytime website</a> and click “Start”</li>
        <li>Sign in with the same Google account that you use on your Google Home or Google Nest device.</li>
        <li>The next page explains how the recording and sharing process works. Read through the steps then press “Next,” then “New Story.”</li>
        <li>Follow the on-screen instructions for recording or uploading a new bedtime story or message.</li>
        <li>You can also share your recordings with other families and friends through My Storytime (you can read about Google’s privacy and safety policy for My Storytime here).</li>
        <li>Once your recordings are uploaded, your child can access them on a Google Home or Nest device by saying “Hey Google, talk to My Storytime.”</li>
      </ol>
