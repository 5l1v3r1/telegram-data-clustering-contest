      <p>For anyone worried about <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/sprouts-may-have-to-be-imported-this-christmas-as-british-shoppers-face-shortage/">the potential shortage of sprouts this Christmas</a>, don't worry - Amazon may have a solution.</p>
      <p>The online retail giant has teamed up with condiment producers Sauce Shop to ensure sprout enthusiasts never have to worry about being caught short without the taste of the little green veg to hand.</p>
      <p>Their new sprout ketchup costs £3 a bottle and contains the goodness of 15 sprouts - blended with cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon - within.</p>
      <p>It is said to taste "sharp, sweet and spiced, like braised cabbage in a bottle" and is recommended for splooshing over <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/">festive</a> leftovers, as a dipping sauce and even for pairing with a cheese board.</p>

      <p>Its makers also reckon it could make a quirky stocking filler gift.</p>
      <p>Sauce Shop co-founder Pam Digva said: "Our limited edition Brussels Sprout Ketchup is testament to the versatility of this highly nutritious, seasonal vegetable which has more vitamin C in one sprout than in an entire orange.</p>

      <p>"It's been a wonderful challenge to bring out the natural sweet, nutty flavour of the often misunderstood Brussels sprout and we’re very proud of our sauce."</p>
      <p>And even though it may seem like there's been a bit of a run on Amazon's stocks of the sprout ketchup - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sauce-Shop-Brussels-Sprout-Ketchup/dp/B081K1QBWL">notes from the UK store suggest it is currently unavailable</a> - there is no need to fret that the sprout shortage has already kicked in.</p>

      <p>That's because it isn't actually on sale yet. The sprout ketchup is expected to be available to buy from December 2.</p>
      <p>Ketchup isn't the only sprout-related product to pop up in the shops this year.</p>
      <p>One retailer is selling <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/you-can-buy-baileys-infused-chocolate-brussels-sprouts-for-christmas/">chocolate Brussels sprouts flavoured with Baileys</a> and ASDA has more <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/asda-is-selling-brussels-sprouts-bites-crisps-for-75p-but-not-everyone-is-convinced/">sprout-flavoured snacks</a> on their shelves.</p>
      <p>The divisive veg has even <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/brussels-sprouts-flavoured-gin-launched-for-christmas-divides-opinion-would-you-give-festive-tipple-a-try/">turned up in gin</a> made by Edinburgh distillers Pickering's!</p>
      <p>You'd never know <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/sprouts-may-have-to-be-imported-this-christmas-as-british-shoppers-face-shortage/">there are concerns sprouts may be in short supply in the UK this Christmas</a>.</p>
