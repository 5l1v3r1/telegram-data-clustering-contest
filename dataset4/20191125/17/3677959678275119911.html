      <p>While some companies churn out flagships with sky-rocketing prices for the masses, ZTE’s Axon 10 Pro does the complete opposite. It provides customers with impressive hardware specifications for a price tag that won’t blow a hole through their wallets. Fortunately, during Black Friday, the Axon 10 Pro is even more affordable than before, as you’ll see in the latest deal.</p>
      <h3>Axon 10 Pro Deal Is Also Available in the 12GB RAM Variant</h3>
      <p>ZTE’s Axon 10 Pro is available at B&amp;H and Newegg, starting from $499 and is the unlocked variant, meaning that it will only work on AT&amp;T and T-Mobile networks. If you purchase the phone from B&amp;H, you’ll get the following:</p>
      <blockquote>Enjoy 3 Months Of Unlimited Talk &amp; Text + 12GB Data Per Month On The Mint Mobile Network.<br/>Offer Ends: Dec 31 '19<br/>Receive FREE Extended Enhance Warranty For 18 Months!<br/>Offer Ends: Nov 30 '19</blockquote>
      <p>While Newegg isn’t offering any freebies, the deal is too good to let go. In case you’re wondering what you’re getting for your money, it’s a smartphone with a 6.47-inch AMOLED screen with a 2340 x 1080 resolution that also supports HDR10, according to ZTE. Under the hood, you’ll find a <a href="https://wccftech.com/snapdragon-855-vs-snapdragon-855-plus-specifications-comparison/">Snapdragon 855</a>, coupled with a triple camera solution. The primary sensor is a 48MP one, followed by an 8MP telephoto unit with 3x optical zoom. The last one is a 20MP ultrawide sensor, with the front side housing a 20MP shooter.</p>
      <p>There’s an <a href="https://wccftech.com/in-screen-fingerprint-reader-explained/">in-screen fingerprint reader</a>, along with a generous 4000mAh battery that supports fast-charging up to 18 watts and uses a Type-C USB port to receive charge. The Axon 10 Pro also supports Qi wireless charging, so that’s a plus for those that don’t want to continuously juice the handset through conventional means. It’s definitely slower than charging the smartphone regularly, but at least you’re getting the added convenience.</p>
      <p>The 12GB RAM variant is for just $549, making it one of the best Snapdragon 855-powered flagships to get as your daily driver, so if you’re on the lookout for an affordable handset, perhaps this could be added to your purchase list.</p>
