      <p>The driver of an HGV has been arrested on suspicion of drink driving in the centre of Exeter.</p>
      <p>The 'truly shocking' incident happened earlier today in the city, and police say the driver appears to be so far over the limit that he will have to wait until the morning to be interviewed.</p>
      <p>"It shouldn’t happen but does and is truly shocking!," tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/PS_Brenchley">Dan Brenchley</a>, a response sergeant for Devon and Cornwall Police.</p>

      <p>The drink-driving limit for drivers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, 35 micrograms per 100 millilitres of breath or 107 milligrams per 100 millilitres of urine.</p>
      <p>In December 2014, Scotland lowered its drink-driving limits to fall in line with most other European countries. The limit is now 50 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, or 22 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath.</p>
      <p>One unit equals 10 millilitres or 8 grams of pure alcohol, but the effect a single unit has on your blood alcohol level varies from person to person, and is dependent on a number of different factors such as gender, age, weight and food you may have eaten.</p>
