      <h1>Kings Reportedly Didn’t Draft Luka Doncic Over Vlade Divac’s Dislike of His Father</h1>

      <p>Sacramento Kings fans haven’t been this upset since the team got screwed out of a title back in 2002 against the Lakers.</p>
      <p>General manager Vlade Divac is said to have completely passed up on selecting Luka Doncic in the 2018 NBA Draft to pick Marvin Bagley III with the No. 2 overall pick, all because he had an issue with Luka’s father, according to ESPN’s Tim MacMahon.</p>
      <blockquote>“My understanding is that [Divac] being so close to Luka and knowing his dad so well factored into their decision,” MacMahon said on ESPN’s “<a href="https://www.totalprosports.com/2019/07/02/report-lebron-james-recruiting-pitch-to-kawhi-leonard-revealed-he-nailed-it/">The Woj Pod</a>,” via NBC Sports’ Kurt Helin. “Basically, he didn’t think a whole lot of Luka’s dad, and the whole like father like son … well … no, this is a different dude.<br/><br/>“You messed that one up, Vlade.”</blockquote>
      <p>To be fair, the Kings did have De’Aaron Fox on the roster, so there was no need for another ball dominant guard. But, Doncic seems to be on his way to greatness as he torches every opposing team that is put in front of him. You cannot pass up the chance to take generational talent, which Doncic appears to be.</p>
      <p>Doncic won the 2019 KIA NBA Rookie of the Year Award and has been lighting up everyone during his sophomore season.</p>
      <p>The Slovenian guard now is averaging 30.6 points, 10.1 rebounds and 9.8 assists while shooting 49.5 percent from the field.</p>
