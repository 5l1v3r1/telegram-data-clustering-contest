      <h1>Video sought in ex-Las Vegas police officer’s child prostitution case</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:29:16+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/staff/david-ferrara/" target="_blank">David Ferrara</a></address>
      <p>A judge on Monday set a preliminary hearing for a retired Las Vegas police officer charged with soliciting a child for prostitution.</p>
      <p>Kirk Reed Hooten, 51, free on $10,000 bond, did not appear in court for a brief hearing, but was represented by his attorney, David Chesnoff.</p>
      <p>Hooten’s <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/sex-crimes/ex-las-vegas-officer-accused-of-soliciting-child-for-prostitution-1898407/">arrest last week</a> stemmed from “a recent incident involving a teenage girl in the valley,” according to Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, who released a statement Friday describing Hooten as a longtime friend.</p>
      <p>In court, Chesnoff asked prosecutors to turn over all video surveillance and audio recordings surrounding Hooten’s arrest.</p>
      <p>The case “should be decided on the facts, not the accusations,” Chesnoff said after the hearing. “People should not rush to judgment.</p>
      <p>Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Diana Sullivan set a preliminary hearing, where the judge decides whether prosecutors have enough evidence to present the case to a jury, for January.</p>
      <p>Metro detectives became aware of the alleged crime after a social media post on Nov. 15 about the incident.</p>
      <p>Further details surrounding Hooten’s arrest have not been released. Metro’s public records division has declined an open records request from the Las Vegas Review-Journal for a copy of Hooten’s arrest report, citing an open investigation, although the department in the past has released arrest reports for suspects not affiliated with Metro.</p>
      <p>Hooten joined Metro in February 1994 and retired in April, according to department records. His assignment at the time of his retirement has not been released.</p>
      <p>His wife, Cheryl Hooten, is assigned to Metro’s Internet Crimes Against Children task force, a division of the department’s sex crimes bureau. The task force investigates the manufacturing, distribution or possession of child pornography; the luring of children with technology; statutory sexual seduction; lewdness with a minor; interstate travel for the purpose of sex with a minor; and other related offenses.</p>
      <p>As recently as May 2018, Kirk Hooten served as health director of the Las Vegas Police Protective Association’s executive board, according to the union’s website.</p>
