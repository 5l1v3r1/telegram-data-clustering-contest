      <h1>Barcelona’s unreliable defender set to return home</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:26:55+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:26</time> by <a rel="author">Nishant Narayanan</a></address>
      <h3>Barcelona defender Samuel Umtiti opens up about a possible return to his French roots, with Olympique Lyonnais [Lyon] in the future.</h3>
      <p>The Frenchman joined Barca from his former club Lyon in 2016 and was immediately integrated as the first choice defender alongside Gerard Pique. However, his success was quite short-lived as the defender suffered from a knee injury that keeps reoccurring over the recent seasons.</p>
      <p>Umtiti has barely made any appearances since his injury and currently performs like a shadow of his former self. His spot in the starting lineup has been taken over by club and country team-mate Clement Lenglet, who has partnered well with Pique over the past seasons.</p>
      <p>Barcelona have <a href="https://everythingbarca.com/2019/11/24/6-players-barcelona-should-look-to-sell-in-january-2020/"><b>reportedly</b></a> decided to sell the world cup winner for a fee estimated to be about 50 million euros. The player’s current contract runs till 2023 and if no favorable offers arrive in the meanwhile, he might get another chance to secure his spot at the Nou Camp.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview with his fellow French team-mate, Alexandre Lacazette, Umtiti shares his future plans for the inevitable day where he hangs his boots and also admitted that a return to France Ligue 1 side, Olympique Lyonnais, is a possibility.</p>
      <blockquote>“I’d like to be a coach. I take notes from those I’ve worked under, their training sessions and what they do. Returning to Lyon is a possibility, as a player or as a coach,” Umtiti told Team Orange Football [<a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/umtiti-i-wouldnt-rule-out-returning-to-olympique-lyon-in-the-future-7749386"><b>Sport]</b></a></blockquote>
      <p>Blaugrana are currently speculating over the future of the defender as there seems to be a sense of unreliability in the performance of the Frenchman.</p>
      <p>Should Barcelona keep Umtiti for another season?</p>
