      <p>Rajkummar Rao and Patralekhaa are one of the most adorable couples in Bollywood. The two have also starred together in the film Citylights in which they showed us how good they work as a pair on the big screen. Yesterday, the two stepped out for a bike ride in the city and with them was the most adorable little puppy which Patralekhaa was holding tightly on to. </p>
      <p>Rajkummar looked uber cool on his Fat Bob wearing a printed shirt and a pair of black denims. Patralkehaa, on the other hand, opted for a plain white shirt and black pants. </p>
