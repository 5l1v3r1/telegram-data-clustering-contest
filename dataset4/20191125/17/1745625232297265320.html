      <p>As previously reported by <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5727010/pussycat-dolls-the-x-factor-reunion/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a>, rumors of the <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/pussycat-dolls">Pussycat Dolls</a> reuniting made headlines. It was said they would make a comeback on <i>The X Factor</i> in the U.K. this month for their first performance in over a decade. One of the judges, Louis Walsh, sat down on British talk show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTKVUHqeKhs">Lorraine</a> today to discuss the final show this weekend and confirmed that it is true.</p>
      <p>When Walsh sat down with his finalist, Megan McKenna, he ended his interview with a world exclusive.</p>
      <p>“And you know whose on? The Pussycat Dolls are the guests! There’s an exclusive for you,” he said.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, November 30, the finale of <i>The X Factor: Celebrity</i> will air.</p>
      <p>Aside from the TV performance, it has been said that the lead singer, Nicole Scherzinger, signed a multimillion-dollar deal to embark on a new tour with her original group members — Ashley Roberts, Carmit Bachar, Melody Thornton, Kimberly Wyatt, and Jessica Sutta.</p>
      <p>And that’s not all. There could also be new music on the way.</p>
      <p>Scherzinger is currently a judge on the talent show and once said she wasn’t to commit to a reunion due to being so busy. However, with the season finale approaching, it seems she’s able to find the time now.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://thatgrapejuice.net/2019/11/pussycat-dolls-sign-major-management-deal-ahead-comeback/"><i>That Grape Juice</i></a>, the group has signed a major management deal ahead of their big comeback. The “I Don’t Need A Man” chart-topper’s join the likes of Rita Ora and Zayn Malik by signing with First Access Management.</p>
      <p>Fans instantly took to social media to express their excitement over the news.</p>

      <p>“The Pussycat Dolls better F**K IT UP ON SATURDAY! PERIOD,” one user wrote.</p>
      <p>“Guys, we’re all gonna be at Pussycat Dolls gigs in 2020, I can’t believe this is real life,” another shared.</p>
      <p>“PCD is making a reunion. I am dying!! My teenage heroes are back!” a third fan remarked.</p>
      <p>“What amazing news!! So excited to see the girls performing together again!” a fourth user wrote.</p>

      <p>It was also reported that Nicole had recently purchased a percentage of the group’s branding rights and that the other band members have been jetting into the U.K. to plan their scheduled performance.</p>
      <p>There has been no confirmation on what song(s) they will perform this weekend.</p>
      <p>At the height of their fame, they sold millions of records that cemented them as one of the biggest girl groups of the 2000s. Their debut album, <i>PCD</i>, sold more than 9 million copies worldwide and celebrated a number of hit singles — “Don’t Cha,” “Buttons,” “Stickwitu,” “Beep,” “I Don’t Need a Man,” and “Wait a Minute.”</p>
      <p>Their second and final album, <i>Doll Domination</i>, was released in 2008.</p>
      <p>The group has a verified <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pussycatdolls/">Instagram</a> account that has no posts yet. However, it is already followed by over 25,800 fans.</p>
