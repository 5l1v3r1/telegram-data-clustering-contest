        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/justin-timberlake/">Justin Timberlake</a> appears to have recovered from his hangover and is back at work on set of his new movie this week, after being pictured holding hands with his co-star Alisha Wainwright.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The SexyBack singer started off his week by returning to the set of his upcoming movie Palmer in New Orleans on Monday, and judging by the concentrated look on his face, he was focused on his work after a hard night of partying last week.</p>
      <p>Pictures show Justin, 38, arriving on set dressed casually in a white shirt and jeans while heading into his trailer which has ‘Wake Up’ on the front door. Clearly in need of a little pick-me-up, Justin carried a coffee cup at one point.</p>
      <p>After a quick change, he was in his character’s costume wearing blue overalls and wearing a strained look on his face.</p>
      <p>Not seen with Justin on-set was his co-star Alisha, whom he was seen holding hands with during a night out on Bourbon Street last Thursday.</p>

      <p>The pair were surrounded by other members of the movie crew and laughed and joked around, clearly having a great time. At one point Justin, who is married to actress Jessica Biel, looked unsteady on his feet and was helped away from the area by another friend.</p>

      <p>According to The Sun, Justin and Alisha were alone on the balcony for around 40 minutes before leaving at 12:30am.</p>
      <p>But sources told People their interactions that evening were completely innocent.</p>

      <p>An insider told the publication: ‘It’s a balcony with a group of people and it was definitely nothing happening. He’s down there shooting Palmer, they’re starring in the movie together and they’re cool and everybody was just hanging out.</p>
      <p>‘The video may look a way, but literally it was nothing. It was some friends, members of the team, crew and people like that. They all know each other and were hanging. Like come on, they’re on an open balcony in New Orleans and he’s famous. It was nothing.’</p>

      <p>A release date for the movie is yet to be announced.</p>
