      <p>While they have being held to two goalless draws in four outings, the La Liga leaders sit a point ahead of their opponents on Wednesday evening.</p>

      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> predicts how the Catalan giants could line up for the showdown with the Bundesliga outfit.</p>

      <p>Barcelona will be without Gerard Pique, who serves a one-match suspension for picking up three yellow cards during the group stages.</p>
      <p>Having missed out at the weekend, Clement Lenglet is also regarded as a major doubt as he continues his recovery from a calf problem.</p>
      <p>Nelson Semedo and Jordi Alba will both miss the contest through calf and hamstring injuries, although <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sergi-roberto/"><b>Sergi Roberto</b></a> is available after serving a domestic ban.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ernesto-valverde/"><b>Ernesto Valverde</b></a> must decide whether to hand a recall to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/arthur/"><b>Arthur</b></a>, who was left out of the squad for the meeting with Leganes.</p>
      <p>However, as it stands, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/arturo-vidal/"><b>Arturo Vidal</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ivan-rakitic/"><b>Ivan Rakitic</b></a> may feature ahead of the Brazilian in the pecking order.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/antoine-griezmann/"><b>Antoine Griezmann</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lionel-messi/"><b>Lionel Messi</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/luis-suarez/"><b>Luis Suarez</b></a> should get the nod in attack, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ousmane-dembele/"><b>Ousmane Dembele</b></a> having to make do with a spot among the replacements against his former team.</p>
