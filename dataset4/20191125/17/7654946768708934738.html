      <h1>Trump ordered that disgraced Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher keep his ‘Trident’ insignia</h1>

      <p>President Trump ordered that embattled Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/def-sec-esper-fires-navy-sec-spencer-over-handling-of-seals-review/">keep his coveted “Trident” insignia</a> that signifies membership in the elite special operations unit, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Monday.</p>
      <p>“I spoke with the president on Sunday,” Esper told reporters at the Pentagon, according to Reuters.</p>
      <p>“He gave me the order that Eddie Gallagher will retain his Trident pin.”</p>
      <p>The revelation marked the latest twist in the controversy surrounding Gallagher, who had faced a disciplinary hearing set to begin next month until Esper fired Navy Secretary Richard Spencer on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Gallagher, 40, was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/03/navy-seal-eddie-gallagher-loses-rank-after-being-cleared-of-murder/">demoted following his July conviction</a> for posing with the corpse of an ISIS fighter in Iraq in 2017. He was acquitted of more serious charges, including premeditated murder in the death of the 17-year-old militant.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Trump granted Gallagher clemency that restored him to the rank of chief petty officer, but the Navy responded by scheduling the hearing at which he faced being expelled from the SEALs.</p>
