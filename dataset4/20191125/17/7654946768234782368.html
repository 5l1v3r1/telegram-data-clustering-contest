      <h1>Princess Beatrice takes fiancé to visit disgraced dad Prince Andrew</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:21:41+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:21</time> by <a rel="author">Lee Brown</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew’s daughter Princess Beatrice on Monday <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/prince-andrew-didnt-step-back-from-royal-duties-queen-elizabeth-fired-him/">visited her disgraced dad</a> for the first time since his humiliating downfall.</p>
      <p>The princess took fiancé Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi with her to Windsor Castle, where her father has been staying since his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, fired him from his royal duties, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7723279/Princess-Beatrice-fiance-Edoardo-visit-fire-Prince-Andrew-Windsor-home.html">the Daily Mail said</a>.</p>
      <p>Beatrice, 31, was photographed smiling as she was driven away from the visit — but she <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/princess-beatrice-devastated-after-helping-set-up-prince-andrews-interview/">is actually devastated</a> at having encouraged her father to do the interview that proved so disastrous, according to reports.</p>
      <p>“Beatrice has been in tears every day since the interview went out,” a source <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7718663/Princess-Beatrice-helped-set-father-Prince-Andrews-car-crash-BBC-interview.html">told the Mail on Sunday</a>, referring to Andrew’s “car crash” BBC sit-down confronting his ties to late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York’s woes could impact his daughters, Beatrice and her 29-year-old sister, Eugenie, according to reports.</p>

      <p>Andrew fears that he now has less of a chance to fight plans by his brother, the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, for a “slimmed-down” monarchy, which would include little official roles for the princesses, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/prince-andrew-looks-to-eugenie-and-beatrice-to-take-over-his-royal-duties-t09d2kqsj?wgu=270525_54264_15746963104278_1dee918643&amp;wgexpiry=1582472310&amp;utm_source=planit&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=22278">the Sunday Times of London said</a>.</p>
      <p>Beatrice may also have to scale back plans for her wedding next year, with a far less grand event than her sister’s big day at Windsor Castle in October, the Daily Mail said.</p>
      <p>“It will be more low-key,” a close friend <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7716671/Has-Prince-Andrews-interview-repercussions-Beatrice.html">told the Daily Mail</a>. But “Bea and Edo are happy for their wedding to get less attention.”</p>
