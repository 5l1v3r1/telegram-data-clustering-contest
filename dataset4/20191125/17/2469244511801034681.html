      <p>In an attempt to raise awareness and eliminate violence and harassment against women and girls, 16 Days of Action has begun in Devon to coincide with a national campaign.</p>
      <p>Events will be taking place every day including thought provoking theatre performances, exhibitions, crafts and stalls.</p>
      <p>One of the biggest events in the calendar is the Reclaim the Night Protest Marches which are being held at three locations in Devon.</p>
      <p>It will see hundreds of women and men walking in solidarity holding lanterns, torches, placards and banners.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, November 28, Exeter’s will begin from St Sidwell’s Community Centre at 6.30pm, and Torquay’s will start from Torquay Town Hall, also at 6.30pm.</p>
      <p>Barnstaple’s Reclaim the Night Vigil and Protest March is being held on Saturday, November 30, at The Square. The vigil will be at 6pm, followed by the march at 7pm. All are welcome to take part in all three marches.</p>
      <p>The marches started in the UK in 1977 and encourage people to march in support of women's rights, to walk anywhere without being in fear of violence, and to stand with women who have been blamed for being a victim of assault.</p>

      <p>A spokeswoman for Reclaim the Night Exeter said: “Exeter Reclaim the Night is a fully inclusive event. All are welcome and we would encourage all communities and individuals to attend.</p>
      <p>“The annual march raises awareness and demands women and girls the right to feel safe on our streets. The march is happening during the 16 days of action, which are between the UN International Day for the Elimination of Violence against women and girls — November 25, and December 10, which is Human Rights Day.</p>
      <p>“This reminds us all that violence and harassment is still an ongoing concern for women in Exeter and Devon as well as across the globe and that it is a human right for us to be able to feel safe out on the streets where we live.</p>
      <p>“If you feel unsure or unsafe about attending this event for any reason please get in touch and help us make this event more inclusive for you.”</p>
      <p>In Torbay, a large deckchair will be travelling the Bay and will be found at a number of locations over the 16 days of action to highlight how coercive control was made a criminal offence in its own right under the Serious Crime Act 2015 and says that controlling or coercive behaviour does not relate to a single incident.</p>
      <p>Coercive control is a purposeful pattern of behaviour, which takes place over time, in order for one person to exert power and control over another.</p>
      <p>People will be invited to sit on the chair and answer questions about what they know about coercion and control. Representatives from the Police and Torbay Domestic Abuse Service will be on hand to answer any questions and provide advice.</p>
      <p>The deckchair will be at South Devon College from November 25 to 29, noon to 2pm, and then at Union Square in Torquay on December 3 and 5, from noon to 2pm.</p>
