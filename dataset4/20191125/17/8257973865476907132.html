      <h1>Funeral for North Korean defector and son to go ahead over objections</h1>

      <p>Nov. 25 (UPI) -- A South Korean government agency in charge of North Korean refugee affairs says it plans to hold a funeral for a North Korean woman and her infant son this week, despite opposition from defector groups.</p>
      <p>The Korea Hana Foundation said Monday in a press release the funeral for Han Sung-ok and her son, who died in their apartment in southern Seoul earlier this year, will take place between Tuesday and Thursday, Yonhap reported.</p>
      <p>Han and her son were found dead in their apartment in southern Seoul in July. The family may have died of starvation at least a month before local authorities entered their apartment to find their decomposing corpses.</p>
      <p>"For humanitarian reasons, we can no longer delay the funeral of the deceased," the Hana Foundation said Monday.</p>
      <p>The government agency also said it has "tried" to narrow differences with defectors with an emergency response committee, but the passage of time -- nearly six months since Han and her son were found in their home -- was stated as the chief reason for going ahead with the funeral.</p>
      <p>Han was granted resettlement in 2009. According to defectors who <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/08/21/North-Korea-defectors-death-reveals-plight-of-trafficked-women/6051566424372/">spoke to UPI,</a> Han had two sons and her second son had died with her, while her ex-husband, a Chinese national, took her firstborn to China.</p>
      <p>On Monday the Hana Foundation said it will "do its best" to prevent future tragedies.</p>
      <p>Defectors have requested Seoul apologize for the incident. They have also demanded a nationwide network be established for North Korean defectors in the South.</p>
      <p>North Koreans have often experienced difficulty adjusting to life in the South, where competition drives young people to succeed at an early age.</p>
      <p>New schools are being established to bridge the learning gap, KBS reported earlier in November.</p>
      <p>A new institution in Seoul with only 53 pupils allows North and South Korean schoolchildren to learn in an "integrated setting," according to the report.</p>
      <p>North Koreans have said the different dialect in the South and their lack of schooling have been obstacles to learning.</p>
