      <p>LYNNWOOD — A woman’s alleged mugger was caught by a police dog early Monday morning.</p>
      <p>The woman, 55, was walking to her front door around 3:30 a.m. in the 15100 block of 44th Place W. when a man wearing a mask approached her. He demanded her purse and hit her in the face with a metal object, the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office said. The suspect, 30, stole her laptop bag and ran, and the woman screamed for help. Her husband heard her and, in his pajamas and barefoot, chased the suspect.</p>
      <p>Another suspect in a car nearby drove off as the other two ran toward it. Without a quick getaway, the fleeing suspect ran through yards and went over a fence and the man in pajamas couldn’t see him.</p>
      <p>Deputies arrived and established a containment area for an Everett police dog to search. The dog, Barron, found the suspect hiding under a deck in the 4400 block of 149th Place SW. The suspect was arrested for investigation of robbery, possession of a controlled substance and an outstanding felony warrant. A metal crowbar and the laptop were found nearby.</p>
      <p>The woman who was mugged was taken to a hospital for evaluation of her injuries.</p>
