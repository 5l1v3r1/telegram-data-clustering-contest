      <p>Security forces have busted a recruitment racket of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) in Nagaland and rescued 32 people during an operation, an official said. Two cadres of the outfit were arrested in this connection.</p>
      <p>Based on a specific input that a group of people was being taken by NSCN (IM) cadres to Aopao camp in Mon district, a joint team of the Army and the Assam Rifles intercepted a vehicle on Mon-Aboi road on November 21 and foiled the bid, Defence PRO Lt. Col. Sumit Sharma said.</p>
      <p>Two NSCN (IM) cadres were apprehended and 32 people hailing from Laokkun, Tizit town, Jaboka, Nokzang, Hatothi (Naginimora) and Chingphoi villages were rescued.</p>
      <p>The people had been lured by the outfit on the pretext of providing jobs, he said.</p>
      <p>Two accused were handed over to the police on November 22 for further investigation, the PRO added.</p>
