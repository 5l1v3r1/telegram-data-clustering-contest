      <h1>Florida woman accused of stealing over $110K in watches from her dates</h1>

      <p>A Florida woman was busted for allegedly swiping more than $110,000 worth of luxury watches from men she met at clubs — including one tourist from New York robbed of his $56,000 timepiece.</p>
      <p>Katelin Wojtowicz, 25, was charged Wednesday with grand theft in connection with three different cases, where she allegedly took dates back to their hotel rooms after a night of partying, waited until they dozed off and then took off with their watches, cash and other goods.</p>
      <p>The blond vixen met the first alleged victim at the Mokai Lounge in Miami Beach in May 2018 and, after a couple drinks, went back to his room at the Fontainebleau Hotel, <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/police-arrest-woman-accused-of-stealing-over-130k-in-valuables-from-miami-beach-hotel-rooms/">7News Miami reported</a>, citing court records.</p>
      <p>When the guy woke up, Wojtowicz was gone — and so were his $12,000 watch, $12,000 in cash, $800 Apple iPhone 7 and $600 Gucci belt, according to the court docs.</p>
      <p>A few months later, on Oct. 10, a New Yorker visiting Miami Beach met up with Wojtowicz at the same club, before taking her back to his room at the 1 Hotel.</p>
      <p>He went to sleep wearing a $56,000 watch. It was missing when he woke up.</p>
      <p>In the third case, Wojtowicz allegedly went up to a man at the Mondrian Hotel bar in January 2019 and began flirting with him.</p>
      <p>When they went back to his room, the man put away some high-end jewelry in a safe and “while doing so … felt [Wojtowicz] standing behind him,” the arrest report states.</p>
      <p>“After placing the items in the safe, the victim has no recollection of the remainder of the night.”</p>
      <p>Wojtowicz allegedly got away with two $20,000 timepieces, a $10,000 Rolex and some money.</p>
      <p>She was released from jail on $22,500 bond, with her arraignment in Miami-Dade County court set for Dec. 19.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time she’s been accused of swindling men out of their watches.</p>
      <p>The alleged time bandit was arrested in Broward County in February 2017 and accused of stealing a man’s $12,000 Ulysses Nardin and $1,000 in cash.</p>
      <p>In that case, the alleged victim met Wojtowicz, then-22, in the casino at the Hard Rock Hotel and paid her $700 for sexual favors before going to sleep and waking up to find his watch gone, court records obtained by The Post show.</p>
      <p>She was nabbed about a week later at the same hotel, after another would-be victim found her riffling through his wallet in the bathroom of his room and attacked her, the arrest affidavit states.</p>
      <p>Wojtowicz pulled a pink taser from her purse to defend herself, which the guy managed to grab and break in half before chasing her out of his room and calling authorities, according to the affidavit.</p>
      <p>Cops realized she matched the image of the person caught on CCTV camera in the watch-theft case.</p>
      <p>She pleaded not guilty and the case is ongoing.</p>
