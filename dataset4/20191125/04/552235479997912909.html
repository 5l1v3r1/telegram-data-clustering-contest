      <h1>Scots cops crackdown on child trafficking gangs smuggling Vietnamese kids into Scotland for slavery</h1>
      <h2>In recent weeks children from Vietnam have approached authorities in Edinburgh looking for help.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T04:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jane Hamilton, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jane-hamilton/</a></address>
      <p>A special <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/police-scotland-hunt-knife-thugs-20944374">police</a> squad has been set up to smash child trafficking gangs who are smuggling Vietnamese youngsters into Scotland.</p>
      <p>The elite unit aims to dismantle the organised crime network preying on migrants, including vulnerable children, to use as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-gang-who-forced-women-20560823">slave</a> labour.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, at least 10 youngsters from Vietnam – all believed to be under 18 – have approached the authorities in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/three-men-firearms-rap-after-20942466">Edinburgh</a> for help.</p>

      <p>The new squad, which operates from the city’s Fettes police station, is interviewing the children to establish how they came to be in the capital.</p>
      <p>The children are understood to have been trafficked from the south-east Asian country and were set to be sent to work in cannabis farms, nail bars and car washes.</p>
      <p>Police are also investigating concerns that some were destined for the sex industry.</p>
      <p>It comes just weeks after the bodies of 39 Vietnamese nationals were found in a refrigerated lorry in Essex.</p>
      <p>One of them, Pham Thi Tra My, sent a heartbreaking last text to her parents as she was suffocating and the youngest victim was only 15.</p>
      <p>We can reveal today that 397 referrals were received by Police Scotland’s National Human Trafficking Unit between January and November 13 this year – of which 196 were Vietnamese nationals and 90 claimed to be under 18.</p>
      <p>The figure is 20 per cent higher than last year.</p>
      <p>An Edinburgh City Council source said: “Trafficking has become a growing problem not just here but across Scotland.</p>
      <p>“At least 10 or 12 youngsters have approached the council, or been identified by the police as having entered this country illegally, and are victims of trafficking.</p>
      <p>“Police Scotland has set up a squad to investigate this. It will be a complex, challenging inquiry, because we are dealing with people who speak little to no English and who are understandably scared and frightened.”</p>

      <p>“It’s becoming a nightmare for councils already under budget strains, as we have to look after these people, but money becomes a secondary issue when you hear what they have gone through.</p>
      <p>“Many are working in cannabis farms for 18 hours a day, get very little food and <br/>are not allowed out unless accompanied by someone.</p>
      <p>“They often don’t get any pay or, if they do, it’s a pittance.</p>
      <p>“These children have been very brave to come forward and I know the police are throwing huge resources at it to find those responsible and also reunite those children with their families if this is possible.”</p>
      <p>Another council source said: “One recent victim claimed to have travelled part of the way with victims of the recent Essex tragedy.</p>
      <p>“Police Scotland must be commended for the robust response in investigating this to catch the perpetrators of these inhuman crimes.”</p>
      <p>A police source said: “The children involved are teenagers but officers are still trying to establish if any younger children are being exploited. At the moment, it’s an intelligence gathering operation and finding out who is working with who.</p>
      <p>“In the past, we’ve discovered Asian crime gangs are working with Eastern European gangs.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Ian Perry, education, children and families convener for Edinburgh City Council, said: “We put in place all appropriate supports for these young people, including education, health care and accommodation.”</p>

      <p>Detective Chief Superintendent Gary Cunningham said: “We recognise that the number of people reporting being trafficked from Vietnam to Scotland continues to rise.</p>
      <p>“We continue to work with UK and international law enforcement and other agencies to understand the reasons for the increase and to conduct thorough investigations to identify those responsible for trafficking these individuals into Scotland.</p>
      <p>“Human trafficking is often hidden in plain sight within our communities.</p>
      <p>“Anyone with concerns about the welfare of someone they suspect of being trafficked should contact the police.”</p>
