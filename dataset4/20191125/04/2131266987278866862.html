      <p>Tyla Nathan-Wong will take on the captain's duties for the Black Ferns Sevens in their closing two tournaments of 2019, after Sarah Hirini was ruled out with a leg injury.</p>
      <p>With experienced speedsters Portia Woodman and Michaela Blyde already out for the Dubai and Cape Town legs of the World Rugby Sevens Series, Hirini becomes the third injury blow for the squad in the early goings.</p>
      <p>Co-Coach Cory Sweeney said Hirini is undoubtedly a loss to the team but there's a strong group of leaders within the selected squad who can step up in her absence.</p>
      <p>"Sarah would have potentially been ready for Cape Town," said Sweeney. "But there is no point risking re-injury when we have our biggest season ever ahead of us; this way she can rehab and be in the best possible shape going into the new year."</p>
      <p>Wing Shiray Kaka has been named to play her first tournament since 2018.</p>
      <p>"Shiray has not only experience on the World Series but is a proven performer at that level. She’s had some injury setbacks but she has earned her spot in this group."</p>
      <p>The Black Ferns Sevens will play in their first back-to-back tournaments on the World Series, the only previous time they have played two full events in a row was the Commonwealth Games followed by the Kitakyushu Sevens in 2018.</p>
