      <p>Actor Randeep Hooda will be reuniting with Salman Khan on the big screen soon. He says the superstar’s films are a genre in themselves.</p>
      <p>“In ‘<i>Kick</i>‘, I changed Salman. In ‘<i>Sultan</i>‘, I trained him and in this (‘<i>Radhe</i>‘), we are going to have some confrontation. Salman’s films are a genre in themselves and I think it’s a different kind of an atmosphere. I, as an actor, definitely believe that one should be able to adapt to all atmospheres and styles of working and I am excited about it,” Randeep told IANS.</p>

      <p>“He has been a very good friend and somebody I have looked up to in more ways than one, so it’s always exciting to be in a movie with him. Through him, my work reaches a lot more people,” added the “Sarbjit” actor.</p>
      <p>He is also teaming up with his “<i>Highway</i>” director Imtiaz Ali once again.</p>
      <p>“We worked together after five years. That <i>(‘Highway’)</i> one was a performance-based role and so is this (the upcoming film) and I love the theme of the film. It is #loveaajkal. It is ‘love aaj kal’ in the times of hashtags, and what it used to be before there were mobile phones. It is kind of a comparison between that,” said Randeep.</p>
      <p>Asked if it is a sequel to the 2009 film “Love Aaj Kal”, he said: “No, it is not. I am not sure how they will describe it.”</p>
      <p>The actor really likes Imtiaz as a storyteller.</p>
      <p>“I was talking to somebody. His movies are more like feelings than just a movie or a storyline. It’s a feeling he creates with his storytelling which lingers on with people,” he said.</p>
      <p>Randeep is also looking forward to the release of <i>“Dhaka”.</i> He calls it as a “biggie”.</p>
      <p>“It’s been produced by the Russo Brothers whom I am a big fan of and it’s even written by Joe Russo. It was really fun. It was full-on action film. It could go out to be as the next ‘Rambo’, you never know,” he said referring to the Sylvester Stallone-starrer action film franchise.</p>
