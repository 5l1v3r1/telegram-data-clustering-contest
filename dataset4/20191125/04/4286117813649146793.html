      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>3 assembly constituencies in West Bengal are facing bypolls today</li>
        <li>About 13.81 per cent of over seven lakh voters voted till 9 am on Monday</li>
        <li>Voters have queued up at Kharagpur Sadar, Kaliaganj and Karimpur constituencies</li>
      </ul>
      <p>About 13.81 per cent of over seven lakh voters on Monday exercised their franchise in the by-polls to three Assembly seats in West Bengal in the first two hours, an EC official said.</p>
      <p>Amidst tight security, people stood in long queues before polling booths under Kharagpur Sadar, Kaliaganj and Karimpur constituencies since morning to cast their votes.</p>
      <p>Over seven lakh people will decide the fate of 18 candidates in the three constituencies.</p>
      <p>Two of the three Assembly constituencies - Kharagpur Sadar and Karimpur - fell vacant post general election as the sitting MLAs contested and won Lok Sabha seats.</p>
      <p>By-polls were necessitated in Kaliaganj following the death of Congress MLA Parmathanath Roy.</p>
      <p>The results will be declared on November 28.</p>
