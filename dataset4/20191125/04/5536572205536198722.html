      <h1>Tom Brady Comments On Officiating After Last Pass Didn’t End Cowboys Game (VIDEO)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T04:50:05+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 04:50</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>There were a bunch of questionable calls during the Patriots-Cowboys game, non more weirder than the New England Patriots’ final offensive play during their 13-9 victory over the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.</p>
      <p>With just five seconds remaining, Brady took the 4th-down snap from Dallas’ 15-yard line and threw the ball high in the air toward the sidelines to run out the clock. Only problem here is that the clock did not go to 0.</p>
      <p>There was one second left and gave the Cowboys one final chance to make something happen.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for New England, Dallas was unable to convert on its final desperation play.</p>
      <p>“It was still up in the air when they stopped the clock,” Brady told reporters. “So I don’t know. Everyone who says Patriots get the advantages. I don’t know about that.”</p>

      <p>That last play for New England pretty much summed up the offensive struggles for the Patriots for the second straight game. They only found the end zone once, but that was only because the Patriots blocked a Chris Jones punt and gave them just 12 yards to pay dirt.</p>
      <p>Their field goal drive in the 1st half was just a mere 3 yards that followed a Stephon Gilmore interception. They only managed 3 points in the entire second half.</p>
      <p>Still, the Patriots are 10-1.</p>
