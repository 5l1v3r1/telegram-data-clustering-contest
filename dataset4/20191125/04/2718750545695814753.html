      <h1>Billie Eilish Wins New Artist of the Year, Reminds Us How Cool Teens Are at the AMAs</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/billie-eilish-bad-guy-billboard-hot-100.html">Billie Eilish</a>, the coolest teen on the planet, just became even cooler after making her televised awards-show performance debut at the AMAs with a fiery performance of her hit single “All the Good Girls Go to Hell.” She also picked up two statues, one for Favorite Alternative Rock Artist and the other for <a href="https://twitter.com/PopNewsroom/status/1198790241777311744">New Artist of the Year</a>. You’d probably be geeking out if you won multiple major music awards at the age of 17, but Eilish was chill as ever, <a href="https://twitter.com/Blllietweets/status/1198795147569442817">hugging Post Malone</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dualipanoticia/status/1198780603501613056">enjoying a lollipop with Dua Lipa</a>, and even <a href="https://twitter.com/AMAs/status/1198792523914739713">introducing the band fronted by a fellow alternative Billie</a> — Billie Joe Armstrong — for the 25th anniversary of Green Day album <i>Dookie</i>. The coolest part? Eilish rocked a shirt that said “No Music On A Dead Planet,” so the Billie Eilish x <a href="https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg">Greta Thunberg</a> x <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/jane-fonda-arrest-climate-change-protest.html">Jane Fonda</a> collab will hopefully be dropping any day now.</p>
