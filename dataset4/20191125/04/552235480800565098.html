      <h1>Thousands of rape victims left without vital help as services in Scotland are so stretched</h1>
      <h2>The snapshot of figures from Rape Crisis Scotland showed 1035 survivors of sexual violence on a waiting list for specialist support, up from 582 last year.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T04:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Annie Brown, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/annie-brown/</a></address>
      <p>More than 1000 victims of rape and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sex-crime">sex assault</a> are denied vital support in a typical day in ­Scotland because services are so stretched.</p>
      <p>The snapshot of figures from Rape Crisis Scotland showed 1035 survivors of sexual violence on a waiting list for specialist support, up from 582 last year.</p>
      <p>The average delay was at least five months and many wait up to a year for help.</p>
      <p>Rape Crisis Scotland’s chief executive, Sandy Brindley, said: “Sexual violence is traumatic and too often, after making the incredibly difficult decision to ask for help, survivors are told they must wait.</p>
      <p>“We don’t believe that any survivor should ever have to wait for lifesaving support."</p>

      <p>In 2018-19, 2293 rapes and 133 attempted rapes were reported to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland">Police Scotland</a>.</p>
      <p>Rape Crisis ­Scotland today launches its biggest ever crowdfunding campaign in the hope of expanding its lifeline services.</p>
      <p>In September last year, the charity was awarded £1.5million over three years by the Scottish Government for its centres but the service ­desperately needs more money to pay for extra staff and helplines.</p>
      <p>The previous month, Glasgow and Clyde Rape Crisis was given emergency ­Scottish ­Government funding after a Children In Need grant wasn’t renewed.</p>
      <p>Survivors from across Scotland have told Rape Crisis Scotland about the mental and emotional damage caused by not being able to access timely specialist support when they are at their lowest ebb.</p>
      <p>The one-day snapshot showed 2660 victims were getting ongoing support from Rape Crisis Scotland, of whom 75 were under 18.</p>
      <p>Fifteen victims had been raped that week and 49 were feeling suicidal.</p>
      <p>The appeal is being launched to coincide with the UN’s 16 Days of Action against Gender Based Violence campaign.</p>
      <p>Rape Crisis’s campaign, £16 for 16 days, calls on the public to stand against rape and sexual violence by donating or raising at least £16 via challenges, ­sponsorship or workplace and community events.</p>
      <p>All money raised will support survivors of sexual violence through 17 Rape Crisis Centres in Scotland and the helpline.</p>
      <h3>Sarah's Story</h3>
      <p>Sarah waited 11 months for help after contacting Rape Crisis in early 2014, having left a violent ex-partner.</p>
      <p>After an initial meeting at Edinburgh Rape Crisis Centre she was told she was in the right place but would be added to the waiting list because there was no one able to see her.</p>
      <p>Sarah, which is not her real name, said: “They couldn’t say exactly how long it would take to start counselling but I’d see updates on social media about waiting lists being closed and services being limited due to funding.</p>
      <p>“As time went on, I lost hope that I would ever move up the list.”</p>
      <p>Her GP could only offer a DVD on relaxation techniques.</p>
      <p>Private counselling seemed to focus more on other traumas or difficulties.</p>
      <p>Sarah held on for sessions with Rape Crisis so she could be helped to deal with this complex trauma.</p>
      <p>She said: “It took 11 months for me to get my first appointment.</p>
      <p>“I felt like I held my breath for that whole time as I tried the best I could just to keep going. I felt extremely isolated.</p>
      <p>“I never thought of myself as someone that would have engaged with counselling but actually it saved my life.”</p>
      <p>Sarah is backing Rape Crisis Scotland’s £16 for 16 days campaign.</p>
      <p>“I want to help reduce any delay. I want to help people take that <br/>first breath.”</p>
