      <p>NEW DELHI: Bhagat Da, as he is fondly called in his home state Uttarakhand, may not have been much offended with both Shiv Sena and Congress slamming him on Saturday for his RSS background. Maharashtra Governor <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Bhagat-Singh-Koshyari">Bhagat Singh Koshyari</a> still wears his RSS colours, the trademark black cap, literally on his sleeve in Raj Bhawan.</p>
      <p>The usually soft-spoken politician in Koshyari pointed out the same even to Rahul Gandhi this June after the latter had stepped down as the Congress president post the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha">Lok Sabha</a> elections. “In the last 10 years, my black cap was an eyesore for you in the Central Hall of Parliament,” Koshyari wrote in a <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Facebook">Facebook</a> post addressed to Gandhi, recounting his terms as a LokSabha and a <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajya-Sabha">Rajya Sabha</a> MP. A senior state politician who has worked closely with Koshyari in Uttarakhandtold ET how he often spoke fondly of his days with RSS when he left with just a jhola to transverse far-off hilly areas in the state for Sangh’s work. “Black cap and white dhoti is his trademark. He is a man of simple living but one with an astute political mind which all can see now,” the politician said, unwilling to be named given the sensitive situation in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>In Uttarakhand’s politics, the former Nainital MP has been a prominent face for the party but one who never got his due. He was made the Chief Minister in October 2001, a year after the state came into being and BJP fought the first polls in the state in 2002 under his leadership but lost them. When BJP won the next assembly polls in 2007, Koshyari was trumped by B.C. Khanduri and later by Ramesh Pokhriyal in 2009 to the top chair in the state. “But he never gave up, much like a disciplined soldier. When he was dropped for a ticket in 2019 from Nainital due to him being 77 years of age, he still campaigned across the state for the party and maximum for Ajay Bhatt who got the ticket,” another BJP functionary in the state said. PM Narendra Modi made Koshyari sit next to him at a rally he did in Rudrapur in the 2019 polls.</p>
      <p>The veteran, who terms himself as the ‘Voice of Uttarakhand’ on his Facebook page, made light of not fighting the polls saying people were only concerned about voting for Modi and not any candidate. He kept at politics even after the polls, paying visits to Union Minister like Rajnath Singh, Gajendra Shkehawat and Dharmendra Pradhan pushing for projects in his erstwhile constituency Nainital and the state. The reward for his discipline and perseverance finally came this September when he was chosen for the Governor’s post in Maharashtra, a month before the state elections.Questions are swirling on how Koshyari woke up early to administer the oath to Devendra Fadnavis. “Well, he is an early riser since his RSS days,” a politician remarked to ET.</p>
