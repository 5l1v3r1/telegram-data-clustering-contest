      <h2>US Supreme Court Justice released from hospital two days after being hospitalized for chills and fever.</h2>

      <p>US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was released <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/272173">from the hospital</a> on Sunday, the court said.</p>
      <p>“She is home and doing well,” the court said in a statement quoted by <i>Reuters</i>.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg, 86, began experiencing symptoms of chills and fever on Friday. She went to a hospital in Washington before being transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore for more evaluations, the court said.</p>
      <p>The court said on Saturday that her symptoms have abated after antibiotics and fluids and that was expected to be released from the hospital the following day.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg, the oldest justice on the court and one of its three Jewish justices, has faced several health scares over the past year.</p>
      <p>Just last week, <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271911">Ginsburg returned</a> to the bench after missing courtroom arguments due to illness.</p>
      <p>In January, <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/257293">Ginsburg missed arguments</a> for the first time in her 25-year tenure on the US Supreme Court in the aftermath of surgery to remove cancer from her lungs.</p>
      <p>In November of 2018, she cracked three ribs in a fall at the court. The Jewish judge <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/255320">was discharged from the hospital</a> the next day and was back at her notoriously vigorous workouts within a week.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg had a fall out with US President Donald Trump before he was elected, <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/214821">when she said in interviews</a> she "can't imagine what the country would be" with Trump as president.</p>
      <p>She <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/215015">later acknowledged</a> her comments were “ill-advised” and added, “Judges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office. In the future I will be more circumspect.”</p>
