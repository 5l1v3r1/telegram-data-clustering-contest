      <p>The spirit of Calgary and Canada shone brightly Sunday, as the Grey Cup Festival drew to a close and the Winnipeg Blue Bombers won the big game.</p>
      <p>“Calgary did things up right — what a party!” said football fan Margaret Olsen, who visited the city from Saskatoon for three days to take in the game and surrounding festivities.</p>
      <p>Fans of every Canadian Football League team took in events throughout the week and then packed Calgary’s McMahon Stadium Sunday to watch the Blue Bombers win the CFL’s 107th Grey Cup.</p>
      <p>Football fans were decked out head-to-toe in their teams’ colours, bundled for the chilly weather. Some Saskatchewan Roughriders fans could be seen with their faces painted green, while B.C. Lions fans wore chunky orange scarves. An Edmonton Oilers jersey was even seen in the stands, as the crowd cheered on the teams on the field.</p>
      <p>The loudest cheers, of course, came from fans of the Blue Bombers and Hamilton Tiger-Cats, who blew into horns, rang cowbells and waved cheer cards.</p>
      <p>Despite their differences, the camaraderie between fans cheering for the Ticats and Bombers — and those cheering for teams that didn’t make the cut this year — was felt in the stands.</p>
      <p>“We all have our differences but it doesn’t matter what’s happening in the country; from the East to West, the Grey Cup and football brings everybody together. It doesn’t even matter which teams are playing; people come no matter what,” said Matt Main, who was at the game from Hamilton with Joe Petruszkiewicz.</p>
      <p>The two of them have been to many Grey Cup games and probably would have attended even if their team, the Tiger-Cats, hadn’t been playing. They’ve made friends from around the country that they only see at the big game every year.</p>
      <p>“We love the Canadian-ness of the Grey Cup. It brings our country together. Everyone’s super friendly and we get to see old friends,” said Petruszkiewicz, who was decked out in black and yellow for his team. “Calgary has done a great job hosting. It’s one of the better ones. Alberta Grey Cups are always the best.”</p>
      <p>The Cantley family made the trip from Winnipeg to watch its team play hard. Kirk Cantley, the father, said he’s been cheering on the Bombers since 1981 and raised his two sons, Shea and Tait, as die-hard fans of the team.</p>
      <p>“This means everything. If they win, I will cry like a baby,” Shea said before the end of the game. He’s 22 and hasn’t seen the Bombers win the Grey Cup in his lifetime. The family was ecstatic at every successful play by its team, who took an early lead and never looked back.</p>
      <p>Kirk said it would mean a lot for him to watch his team win with his sons. The three of them, with friend Matthew Parsons, were celebrating with Bombers’ fans in the seats around them, though none of them sat for the entire game.</p>
      <p>Mike Franco, 2019 Grey Cup Festival chair, said there’s something special about seeing the big smiles on people wearing every colour of jersey in the league.</p>
      <p>“There’s no animosity. There’s a brotherhood and sisterhood in football and here in the Canadian Football League games,” said Franco. “One of the best things to see is all those different coloured jerseys arm-in-arm and being a part of the CFL and Canadiana of the Grey Cup.”</p>
      <p>During the half-time show, country music star Keith Urban took to the stage bringing energy to the stadium. With perfectly-timed pyrotechnics, the concert impressed the crowd.</p>

      <p>“I’m a huge country music fan, so Keith Urban was a nice added bonus for me,” said Melissa Marlatt, a Bombers’ fan from Winnipeg. This was her first Grey Cup experience and she couldn’t be happier about her time at the game.</p>
      <p>Joey Walker, also from Winnipeg, agreed, “Keith Urban makes it worth the price of admission.”</p>
      <p>Overall, it was a big week in Calgary with a four-day festival taking place on the Stampede Grounds that saw thousands more visit the Nissan Titan street festival — the 71st iteration of such a party.</p>
      <p>There, people were treated to parties inside the BMO Centre with halls packed for cold drinks and filling treats. Outside, festival grounds saw a 50-metre tubing slide along with an 18-metre high inflatable dome offering up 360-degree videos.</p>
      <p>“Fans really did feel like they got a taste of Calgary, whether it was at the business summit on Thursday … or the rodeo on Saturday. I really feel we put the Calgary spirit as front and centre of this thing,” said Franco.</p>
      <p>Inside the Corral, a Saturday night sold-out rodeo featured buckin’ broncos and a live performance from Canadian country star George Canyon.</p>
      <p>The highlight for many was the visit of Tuffy the Horse, who trotted his way through the Hilton Garden on 4th Street S.E. before stopping at the King Eddy for a quick pint on Friday evening.</p>
