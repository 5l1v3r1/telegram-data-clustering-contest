      <p>A day after a 22-year-old cab driver went missing from Gurgaon’s Pataudi, police found his body in his car near a dried-up drain in Pataudi’s Khor village Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>Police said they identified the man, Yusuf, after they issued an advertisement in a local newspaper and were approached by his family.</p>
      <p>According to police, Yusuf’s family told them that he left home Friday morning to pick up a passenger from Pataudi and didn’t return home.</p>
      <p>Yusuf’s brother Farrukh said, “On Saturday, I couldn’t find him at his home or with his friends. Later, we learned that Yusuf’s car was found near a drain in Sohna district. Police had seized the car and recovered his body. I went to the hospital and identified his body later.”</p>
      <p>Yusuf lived in a rented accommodation in Imam Nagar in Gurgaon.</p>
      <p>A case of murder and causing disappearance of evidence was registered against unknown persons by Pataudi police after they found injuries on the victim’s head and back.</p>
      <p>Police suspect that he was killed in a robbery gone wrong and his body may have been dumped in the car later.</p>
      <p>A post-mortem was conducted and police are awaiting its result.</p>
