      <p>Now that we live in a day and age in which notched, edge-to-edge displays are the norm for Apple-branded smartphones, those sporting traditional rectangular displays are beginning to show their age both in terms of appearance and functionality.</p>
      <p>Despite the massive bummer this seems to entail at first glance, those who’ve taken the steps to jailbreak their aging iPhone can now call upon the help of a newly released and free <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/jailbreak-apps-tweaks/">jailbreak tweak</a> called <b>Little11</b> by iOS developer <i>Ryan Nair</i> to port many of the of the latest gestures and user interface elements that we’ve come to enjoy on the iPhone X and later to older handsets with traditional rectangular displays</p>
      <p>In the screenshot examples above, you’ll notice many of the things that Little11 can bring to non-notched handsets, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Home Bar</li>
        <li>Home Bar-based app-switching</li>
        <li>iPhone X-style <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/status-bar/">Status Bar</a></li>
        <li>iPhone X-style Dock</li>
        <li>And much more…</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Upon installing Little11, you’ll find a dedicated preference pane in the Settings app where you can configure the tweak to your liking:</p>

      <p>Here, you can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Choose your preferred Status Bar style</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Default Status Bar</li>
            <li>iPad Status Bar</li>
            <li>iPhone X Status Bar</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Toggle the Home Bar on or off globally</li>
        <li>Toggle the Home Bar on or off on the Lock screen only</li>
        <li>Enable or disable the larger keyboard</li>
        <li>
          <p>Enable or disable the rounded App Switcher and <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/dock/">Dock</a></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Adjust the corner radius via a slider</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Reduce Home screen icon rows by one</li>
        <li>
          <p>Enable or disable the rounded screen corners</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Adjust the corner radius via a slider</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Enable or disable the Status Bar-based <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/control-center/">Control Center</a> grabber</li>
        <li>Toggle the Status Bar-based battery percentage</li>
        <li>Enable or disable Picture-in-Picture video viewing</li>
        <li>Enable or disable <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/face-id/">Face ID</a> animations for user authentication</li>
        <li>Enable or disable Lock screen shortcuts for flashlight and Camera</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The developer includes a Respring button at the bottom of the preference pane to help you save any changes you make.</p>
      <p>While we wouldn’t recommend all of these features on a traditional rectangular display due to size constraints, we particularly like the iPhone X-style Status Bar and Dock, and the Lock screen shortcuts, among other things. Others may appreciate Picture-in-Picture support and Home Bar support, but your mileage may vary.</p>
      <p>Those interested in downloading Little11 can <a href="https://repo.packix.com/package/com.ryannair05.little11">snag it completely free of cost from the Packix repository</a> in their package manager of choice. The tweak works with all <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/jailbreak/">jailbroken</a> iOS 11, 12, and 13 devices.</p>
