      <p>KOLKATA: Eden Gardens welcomed two special guests on Saturday when <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/chess">chess</a> wizards <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/magnus-carlsen">Magnus Carlsen</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/viswanathan-anand">Viswanathan Anand</a> made a quick visit to ring the ceremonial bell to signal the start of second day's play in the pink-ball Test between India and Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>Since both Grandmasters had three rapid games lined up in the penultimate leg of the Grand Chess Tour (GCT) later in the day, they didn't get time to watch any cricket.</p>
      <p>Asked about his Eden experience, the World chess champion revealed he had no clue of what was happening. "What actually happened was Anand rang the bell and I stood there stupidly having no knowledge of what was happeningâ€¦ That was my experience to sum it up," he admitted on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"I have a lot to learn about cricket," he added, before being told that that the match was over. "Oh, it's over! India won! Then no more chance of going (to Eden)," the Norwegian quipped.</p>
      <p>Young <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Vidit-Gujrathi">Vidit Gujrathi</a>, however, did not miss the chance to catch some cricket late on Saturday after finishing his matches at National Library's Bhasha Bhawan. "Watching the cricket match #IndvsBan. The perfect way to unwind after a long day of chess," the Nashik-based GM tweeted.</p>

      <p>But that did not amuse US Grandmaster <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hikaru-Nakamara">Hikaru Nakamara</a>, who replied: "Cricket-...cricket? What's a cricket?</p>
