        <b>Kangana Ranaut is a woman of many talents. After being an actor and director, she has now turned producer. The lady has announced her next venture as a producer. A film called Aparajitha Ayodhya based on Ayodhya Ram Mandir case is in the making</b>

      <p>Kangana Ranaut knows her strengths very well. She dwelled in direction with Manikarnika - The Queen of Jhansi and now, she is going to be a producer too. She has started her production house named after Manikarnika and the first film that she is financing is a film based on Ayodhya Ram Mandir Case. It has been titled Aparajitha Ayodhya. It was recently that the Supreme Court released its order in this years-old case, and now, Kangana is all set to bring the complete journey of Ayodhya on celluloid.</p>
      <p>Reportedly, the film will roll early next year and is scripted by KV Vijayendra Prasad, the creator of the Bahubali series. Sharing her thoughts on this film, Kangana said, "The Ram temple has been a burning topic for hundreds of years. As a child born in the ’80s, I have grown up hearing the name Ayodhya in a negative light because the piece of land on which was born a king, who was the epitome of sacrifices, became the subject of a property dispute. The case has changed the face of Indian politics and the verdict has ended the centuries-old dispute while embodying the secular spirit of India. What makes Aparajitha Ayodhya different is that it is the journey of the protagonist from a non-believer to a believer. And since, in a way, it reflects my personal journey, I decided it would be the apt subject for my first production." (Alo</p>

      <p>It was on November 9, 2019, that the Supreme Court announced its judgment on Ayodhya Ram Mandir case. The Apex court ruled out that a different body will be made to ensure that a Ram Mandir is built on the given land while a separate 5-acres would be given to Sunni Waqf Board to build a mosque. </p>
