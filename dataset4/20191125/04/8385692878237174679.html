      <p>This device is currently priced at $219 over at Best Buy. The Acer Spin 11 Chromebook usually priced at $329, which means you'll save $110 if you get it now.</p>

      <p>The device is available in the Obsidian Black variant over at Best Buy, in case you're interested. We're not sure how long will this deal last, so it may be wise to act fast if you're interested.</p>
      <p>The Acer Spin 11 is an entry-level Chromebook that can serve you as both a laptop, and a tablet. It comes with a touch-sensitive display, and you can spin its display all the way around, as its name suggests.</p>
      <p>You can flip that display to the back of this device, and that will essentially turn this device into a thick tablet. The keyboard on the Spin 11 is surprisingly good, and the device is quite small, mainly due to its display.</p>

      <p>It comes with an 11.6-inch 1366 x 768 display, and it is fueled by the Intel Celeron N3350 dual-core processor. The device also packs in 4GB of RAM.</p>
      <p>You will get access to the Google Play Store on this device. That basically grants you access to Android's vast collection of applications that you can utilize on the device. Chrome OS comes pre-installed, though, of course.</p>
      <p>You'll get access to two USB 3.0 ports on the device, while a headphone jack is included as well.
