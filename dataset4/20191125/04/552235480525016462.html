      <h1>Police Scotland rise to Modern day slavery challenge with new squad</h1>
      <h2>Modern day slavery is a vile trade taking place across Scotland and police need all the support they can get to fight it.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T04:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Record View, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/record-view/</a></address>
      <p>Modern day slavery is right here, right now in Scotland.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks a dozen Vietnamese youngsters have presented themselves to the authorities having believed to have been <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/human-trafficking">trafficked</a> across continents to be set to be sent to work in cannabis farms, nail bars and car washes in our towns and cities.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland">Police</a> are also investigating concerns some were destined for the sex industry and escaped before being farmed out to flats operating across Scotland.</p>
      <p>This vile trade is taking place all across the country and in response a new squad of police officers has been set up to deal with what will be a complex, challenging crime.</p>
      <p>The victims are young people who speak little to no English and who are understandably scared and frightened to talk.</p>
      <p>The police need all the sensitivity and support that they can get in trying to fight this scourge that is hidden in plain sight in our daily lives.</p>
      <p>Anyone with any information or concerns about the welfare of someone they suspect of being trafficked should contact the police and help stop slavery.</p>
      <h3>Back rape victims</h3>
      <p>Shockingly, more than 2,000 rapes and attempted <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sex-crime">rapes</a> were reported to police in Scotland over the last year.</p>
      <p> In one sense the rise is welcome because it shows that more people are coming forward to make complaints about serious sexual assaults.</p>
      <p>But that also creates its own crisis as the support network to help people, overwhelmingly women, is not there to match the increase in reported rapes.</p>

      <p>The Rape Crisis crowdfunding campaign, £16 for 16 days, calls on the public to stand against rape and sexual violence by donating or raising a minimum of £16 pounds through challenges, sponsorship, or workplace and community events.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of women are being supported by Rape Crisis centres across Scotland, but hundreds more need help.</p>
      <p>There could hardly be a more worthwhile cause to consider this Christmas.</p>
      <h3>Marc's a hero too</h3>
      <p>Inspired by his own sporting heroes Marc Fairbairn has found the courage to speak out about the debilitating condition brought on by motor neurone disease.</p>

      <p>The 29 year old has lived with the illness for a decade, and although now confined to a wheelchair, he finds his daughter gives him the strength to keep fighting.</p>
      <p>The young man is a hero himself.</p>
