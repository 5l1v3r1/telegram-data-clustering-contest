      <p>Two men died and a third sustained injuries after the bike they were travelling on skidded and they fell on a “chemical” that had spilt on the road, police said. The incident took place near Mori Gate at 5.45 am on Saturday. Police suspect the substance caused severe burn injuries to the victims and led to their death Sunday. Investigation revealed that a truck was carrying the substance, which leaked on the road.</p>
      <p>DCP (North) Monika Bhardwaj said the three men were on a black Splendor. “After they fell, they experienced a burning sensation on their bodies due to the chemical which is suspected to have leaked from a vehicle. A picket team from Kashmere Gate police station rushed to rescue the men and took them to Aruna Asaf Ali Hospital. Later, the men were referred to Lok Nayak Hospital where two of them died during treatment. The third man is undergoing treatment.”</p>
      <p>The victims were identified as Mahesh Chand (23) and Shivam Lal (21), while the injured man has been identified as Monu Sharma (22). The men were contractual workers at the New Delhi Railway Station. Police said initial investigation showed that the men weren’t speeding and that their bike skidded due to the substance. While Chand and Lal fell on the substance, Sharma fell on the footpath, said police.</p>
      <p>A post-mortem examination was conducted and police are awaiting the reports to ascertain the cause of death. A case under IPC sections 285 (negligent conduct with respect to combustible matter ) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life) has been registered against unknown persons.</p>
      <p>Police said the three men were returning home from a friend’s wedding in Shiv Vihar and were using their phones to find their way. They had left around 4 am but lost their way and took a long route from Sadar Bazaar to Mori Gate. A senior officer said they have recovered their half-burnt bike.</p>
      <p>Police scanned CCTV footage and identified a truck which they suspect was carrying the substance and are now trying to trace the owner. “A Crime branch team went to the spot and collected samples. We have sent them to the Forensic Science Lab to identify the substance and its nature,” said DCP Bhardwaj.</p>
      <p>Dr Kishore Singh, Medical Director at Lok Nayak Hospital, said Chand and Lal were in a coma when they were brought to the hospital: “Doctors attempted to revive them but they died. The injured man is undergoing treatment in the Neurology department.”</p>
      <p>He added: “It’s hard to say what caused their deaths; we are checking the chemical and considering others factors as well.”</p>
