      <h1>Lebanon Protesters Clash With Hezbollah, Amal Supporters in Beirut</h1>
      <h2>Incident was the worst tension in the Lebanese capital since a mob loyal to the Shi'ite groups attacked and destroyed the main protest camp in October</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T04:06:55+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 04:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/writers/WRITER-1.4968129" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Clashes broke out between anti-government demonstrators and supporters of the Shi'ite groups Hezbollah and Amal in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, early on Monday, as tensions escalated when demonstrators blocked a main bridge.</p>
      <p>Lebanon has faced five weeks of anti-government protests, fueled by anger at corruption among the sectarian politicians who have governed <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-lebanon-1.5598955">Lebanon</a> for decades. Demonstrators want to see the entire ruling class gone from power.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-hezbollah-1.5598890">Hezbollah</a> and Amal were both represented in the coalition government led by <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/lebanon-pm-hariri-likely-to-resign-official-says-1.8054011">Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, who quit on October 29</a> after the protests began. The heavily armed Hezbollah, which is backed by <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/iran">Iran</a>, had opposed Hariri's resignation.</p>
      <p>Army soldiers and riot police formed a barrier separating the protesters from the supporters of the Shi'ite groups on a main road known as the Ring Bridge as rocks were thrown by both sides, television footage broadcast by Lebanese media showed.</p>
      <p>Security forces fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, three local television stations reported.</p>
      <p>Supporters of Hezbollah and Amal waved the groups' flags. Earlier, they had chanted: "Shia, Shia" and slogans in support of Hezbollah leader <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-hassan-nasrallah-1.5598889">Hassan Nasrallah</a>. On the other side, demonstrators chanted: "Revolution, revolution".</p>
      <p>Lebanese broadcaster al-Jadeed reported that fighting apparently broke out when Hezbollah and Amal supporters blamed other demonstrators for making offensive comments about Nasrallah. Reuters could not independently verify the report.</p>

      <p>The ground was strewn with rocks. A motorcycle was set on fire.</p>
      <p>The Lebanese civil defense said on its Twitter account that it was administering first aid to five people suffering from "various injuries."</p>
      <p>It was the worst tension in Beirut since a mob loyal to Hezbollah and Amal attacked and destroyed the main protest camp in central Beirut last month. The protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful.</p>
