The company plans to commission a total of around 800 MW of new capacity of wind and solar projects in FY2020. The Group has won bids for 130 MW wind and 600 MW Hybrid in Q1FY20.

      <p>"Higher-than-expected operational performance of the specil purpose vehicles (SPVs), availability of strong liquidity buffers leading to consolidated interest coverage ratio above 2.0 times on a sustained basis, and reduction in ratio of under construction assets to operational assets would be positive for the ratings," Ind-Ra said in rating rational.</p>
