      <h3>National media view</h3>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers climbed to fifth in the Premier League table after Saturday's 2-1 victory at Bournemouth.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/joao-moutinho">Moutinho's</a> gorgeous free-kick got Wolves on the front foot at the Vitality Stadium, before Raul Jimenez notched his 14th goal of an eye-catching campaign.</p>
      <p>Simon Francis was also sent off before the half-time break, and a 57th-minute header from Steve Cook was not enough to salvage anything for the 10-man Cherries.</p>
      <p>Nuno's men have now won four of their last seven Premier League games - and they have not lost since September 14.</p>
      <p>That form, the performance against Bournemouth and the individual display of Moutinho have all come in for praise from the national media.</p>

      <h3>Merson’s silly comments</h3>

      <p>Months after labelling Adama Traore ‘cringeworthy’, Paul Merson has put his foot in his mouth once again, <b><i>writes Ben Husband.</i></b></p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of the game he suggested that Wolves were lucky to have Nuno and that he could leave for a ‘top six’ side.</p>
      <p>“I worried about these at the start of the season,” he said, “Because last year, they beat the good teams and I thought, if they don’t start beating the bad ones, they aren’t going to keep beating the good ones.”</p>
      <p>“I like the manager, I think they are fortunate to have this manager. I don’t mean that disrespectfully but I think he could take one of the top six jobs. I’d take him at Arsenal tomorrow morning.”</p>
      <p>Well ‘Merse’ after more than a dozen games, guess what? Wolves are a top six side. They were arguably one of the best six teams in the division last season and this time around there is an even stronger argument.</p>
      <p>They say teams reflect their manager. And like Nuno, Wolves are ruthlessly aggressive and focused. So in a way, Merson is right. He may be managing a top six club. But it may be the one he's already at.</p>
