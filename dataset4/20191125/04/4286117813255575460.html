      <p>Tesla Cybertruck is creating a record of sorts. The automaker has already received 1.87 lakh orders for the electric pickup truck, which was <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/auto/latest-auto-news/story/tesla-cybertruck-unveiled-price-motor-range-features-other-details-explained-1621572-2019-11-22https://www.indiatoday.in/auto/latest-auto-news/story/tesla-cybertruck-unveiled-price-motor-range-features-other-details-explained-1621572-2019-11-22">unveiled on November 22</a>. The tremendous interest in the Cybertruck comes even after the "ultra-strong" armoured glass windows of the vehicle shattered while demonstrating their damage tolerance at the much-anticipated showcase.</p>
      <p>In a tweet today, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the automaker has garnered 1.87 lakh orders for the Cybertruck. Earlier on November 24, Musk had informed that 1.46 lakh orders were received, with 42 per cent customers going for dual, 41 per cent tri and 17 per cent single motor variants. He had also claimed that the orders were secured "with no advertising and no paid endorsement".</p>
