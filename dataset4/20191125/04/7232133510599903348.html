      <h3>Ripple Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In the past few sessions, there was a nasty drop in ripple below the $0.2350 and $0.2250 support levels against the US Dollar. Moreover, XRP/USD declined more than 10% and recently tested the main $0.2000 support level.</p>
      <p>Finally, a new multi-month low was formed near $0.2003 and the price settled well below the 100 hourly simple moving average. It is currently correcting higher above the $0.2050 and $0.2080 resistance levels.</p>
      <p>Besides, the price traded above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.2349 high to $0.2003 low. However, there are many resistances on the upside, starting with the $0.2180 level.</p>
      <p>The 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.2349 high to $0.2003 low is also near the $0.2180 level to act as a resistance. Additionally, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.2250 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.</p>
      <p>Above the trend line resistance, ripple price might attempt a decent recovery. The next key resistance is near the $0.2350 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the price must settle above the $0.2350 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average to move into a positive zone. Conversely, the price might struggle to climb above $0.2250 and it could resume its decline.</p>
      <p>An initial support on the downside is near the $0.2050 level. The main support is near the $0.2000 level, below which there is a risk of a drop towards the $0.1950 support area.</p>
