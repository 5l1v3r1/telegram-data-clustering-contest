      <p>With not much competition coming from Hindi films, except for the fact that it has lost a major count of screens, <i>Bala</i> changed gears further on Sunday. The film collected <b>3.22 crores</b> more and that has elevated its score further to <b>105.87 crores.</b></p>
      <p>The Ayushmann Khurranna, Yami Gautam and Bhumi Pednekar starrer would come close to the <b>110 crores</b> mark by the end of week and from there a lifetime in the vicinity of <b>120 crores</b> would be a possibility. That would make it Ayushmannâ€™s third highest grossing film after<i> Dream Girl</i> and <i>Badhaai Ho</i>. As for Dinesh Vijan and Amar Kaushik, it would be their second highest grossing film as well after <i>Stree</i> <b>(129.67 crores).</b> In fact that film had also benefitted from chartbuster tracks and had that been the case of <i>Bala</i>, perhaps it may just have come further close.</p>

      <p>The film is still amongst the Top-15 biggest grossers of 2019. There are a few biggies lined up for release in the last month of the year but still, <i>Bala</i> should stay in the Top-20 before the close of year.</p>
      <p>Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources</p>
