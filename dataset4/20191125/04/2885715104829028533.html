      <h1>Hardeep Puri says will make Manoj Tiwari Delhi CM, clarifies later</h1>
      <h2>Tiwari, who was present at the event, said: “As a state president, my duty is to ensure that we form a government in the state. The issue is not who will be CM; instead we should look at the AAP’s restlessness. This shows that they will not be able to sleep at night.”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T04:27:10+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 04:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/abhinav-rajput/" target="_blank">Abhinav Rajput</a></address>
      <p>A statement made by Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri at a public event, where he said the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> will contest polls in Delhi to make Manoj Tiwari the chief minister, which was followed by a clarification Sunday gave the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/aam-aadmi-party/">Aam Aadmi Party</a> a handle to target the party.</p>
      <p>Addressing party workers in Tiwari’s constituency of North East Delhi, Puri said: “<i>Manoj Tiwari ke netritwa mein hum election ladne ja rahe hain aur inko hum chief minister bana kar hi chorenge</i> (We are going to contest Assembly elections under the leadership of Manoj Tiwari and we will ensure that he becomes the chief minister).” Puri is also the the co-incharge of the Delhi BJP.</p>
      <p>As AAP leaders, including Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh, started “congratulating” Tiwari on Twitter, Puri clarified in a tweet: “BJP is moving towards a victory in Delhi. The party has not named anyone as the CM face. Shri Manoj Tiwari is the Delhi BJP president. The party is working enthusiastically under his leadership. My statement meant that BJP will win the upcoming elections with a heavy majority under his leadership.”</p>
      <p>According to sources, the BJP has no plans to project a CM face before polls.</p>
      <p>Tiwari, who was present at the event, said: “As a state president, my duty is to ensure that we form a government in the state. The issue is not who will be CM; instead we should look at the AAP’s restlessness. This shows that they will not be able to sleep at night.”</p>
      <p>Asked about the possibility of him being the CM face, he said that such decisions are taken by the parliamentary board.</p>
      <p>Soon after Puri’s statement, AAP leaders Sisodia and Singh had posted a series of tweets.</p>
      <p>“I congratulate Manoj Tiwari for being declared the CM candidate for the upcoming assembly polls by BJP,” Sisodia wrote.</p>
      <p>Singh said that with the announcement, it is certain that AAP would perform better than it did last time. AAP had won 67 out of 70 seats in 2015 polls.</p>
      <p>When Puri clarified his statement, Singh tweeted asking BJP to declare the name of its CM face: “Respected Hardeep Puri ji, People of Delhi want to know who is your face in opposition to <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/arvind-kejriwal">Arvind Kejriwal</a>. You took Tiwari ji’s name but exited the battlefield within two hours. Has BJP given a walkover to Kejriwal?”</p>
      <p>BJP sources said that apart from Tiwari, Union Minister Harsh Vardhan and former Union Minister Vijay Goel also fancy their chances should the BJP win in Delhi.</p>
