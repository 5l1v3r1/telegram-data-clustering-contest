      <h1>Liverpool and Arsenal 'tracking Wolves youngster Owen Otasowie'</h1>
      <h2>Teenager can play in defence or midfield and caught the eye of Paris-Saint Germain in recent match against French club's under-23 side</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T04:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool and Arsenal are reportedly tracking Wolves youngster Owen Otasowie.</p>
      <p>But they face competition from the continent for the centre-back, with PSG and Schalke also interested in the 18-year-old.</p>
      <p>Otasowie, who can also play in midfield, is out of contract in the summer and would be available for training compensation.</p>
      <p>And Liverpool and Arsenal are both monitoring his progress at Wolves as they look to build for the future, according to the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10413236/wolves-otasowie-transfer-arsenal-psg-liverpool/">Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>The publication says youngster Otasowie caught the eye of Ligue 1 leaders Paris-Saint Germain when he played against them for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> under-23s in a 1-1 draw in the Premier League International Cup last week.</p>

      <p>Otasowie looked commanding in defence and assured in possession against Paris-Saint Germain, and impressed in one-on-one situations, with some fans on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> hailing the youngster as their man of the match.</p>
      <p>He is also being tracked by Bundesliga club Schalke, who are managed by former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/huddersfield-town-fc">Huddersfield</a> boss David Wagner and are renowned for giving young players opportunities.</p>
      <p>Otasowie has represented USA under-18s and is eligible to play for England and Nigeria, but is yet to decide where his international future lies.</p>
      <p>He joined Wolves U23s from the club's U18 squad in July and has so far played just 86 minutes across four games in Premier League 2.</p>
      <p>However, he is highly rated and has started to clock up more time on the pitch in recent weeks, playing the full 90 minutes in Wolves' 1-0 defeat to Blackpool in the EFL Trophy.</p>
      <p>Otasowie played as a defensive midfielder in that game, showing his versatility.</p>
      <p>He has previously also been linked with interest from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> and Ajax.</p>
