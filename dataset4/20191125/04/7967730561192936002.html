        <b>QUEENSCLIFF MUSIC FESTIVAL ★★★½<br/></b>
        <b>Queenscliff, November 22-24</b>
      </p>
      <p>At Queenscliff Music Festival, the line for the Timboon ice-cream truck was longer than the line for the bar.</p>
      <p>That gives you some indication of the glorious weather at the weekend, and also the relaxed and family friendly feel to the festival.</p>
      <p>Big names played the main Lighthouse stage, but the mosh pit of toddlers at Playschool star Justine Clarke's set was also pumping for hit songs such as <i>Watermelon</i> and <i>The Silly Song.</i></p>

      <p>The range of ages wasn't lost on Missy Higgins, who headlined the festival on Sunday afternoon, observing: "There's a lot of youngies in the audience."</p>
      <p>Higgins interspersed old songs such as the poignant <i>Don't Ever</i> with material from her latest album – which she described as "more disco" – including <i>Futon Couch,</i> a love song for her husband.</p>
      <p>It may be several years since Higgins first wowed with her debut album <i>The Sound of White</i> in 2004, but her ability to write a searing lyric and to carry a crowd with her striking voice has not changed.</p>
      <p>Earlier, The Waifs had the audience on its feet dancing and clapping, with a set that included <i>Lighthouse</i> – in the shadow of Queenscliff's lighthouse.</p>
      <p>Vikki Thorn showed what an underrated instrument the harmonica is as it soared through <i>Fisherman's Daughter,</i> while Donna Simpson sated the crowd with the classic <i>London Still,</i> which Simpson recalled knocked Beyonce out of Triple J's Hottest 100.</p>
      <p>On Saturday night audiences were treated to the horn-heavy, high-energy songs of the Cat Empire, with the band typically exuberant.</p>
      <p>"Music is the language of us all," they sang, and that evening it felt true, with the band creating a carnival-like atmosphere.</p>
      <p>The legendary Tim Finn set the mood with his bluesy vocals, and there were gems to be discovered off the main stage, too – including Brisbane-based electro dub crew Dubarray.</p>
      <p>With multiple stages and even gigs chugging along railway tracks aboard Queenscliff's Blues Train, there was always something on over the festival's three days.</p>
      <p>Entry was free for kids aged under 13, and they were kept entertained with free rides and a dedicated children's program including the puntastic The Vegetable Plot trio and hula-hooping with the Bebop Circus.</p>
      <p>The main dilemma for parents was extracting offspring from the plate-spinning workshops to catch one of the many musical treats tucked away around the historic township, from buskers on the street corners to yoga with music to start the day.</p>
      <p>Forget the body glitter and feathered headdresses, at unpretentious Queenscliff, the accessories of choice were babies with ear muffs, felt hats and reusable crockery. It is a festival for everyone.</p>
