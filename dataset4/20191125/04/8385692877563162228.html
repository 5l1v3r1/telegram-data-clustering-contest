      <p>Best Buy has already started one of its more popular Black Friday deals, which is going to be for the Xbox One S All-Digital Edition. It is now just $149, and that comes with three digital games. These include Minecraft, Sea of Thieves, and Fortnite Battle Royale. There is also a month of Xbox Live Gold included for free, which is going to be needed to play Fortnite online.</p>
      <p>Amazon is selling the Insignia 32-inch 720p Fire TV today for just $99. That makes this a really great TV to add to a second bedroom or even a guest bedroom. As it is a pretty decent sized TV, but also inexpensive. At under $100, this would also be great for a kids room.</p>
      <p>Amazon also has the Jabra Elite 65t Earbuds on sale for just $99. These are some of the best truly wireless earphones on the market, and coming at nearly half price makes it a really great time to pick up a pair. These also work with Amazon Alexa, so you can have Alexa in your ear to read your text messages and much more.</p>

That makes this a really sweet deal for those looking to get a new smartphone, as you'll also get a pair of Galaxy Buds too.</p>
      <p>Also part of its Black Friday Week of sales, you'll find the bundle of the Ring Video Doorbell 2 and the Echo Show 5 on sale for just $139. Now for reference the Ring Video Doorbell 2 is normally priced at about $199 by itself. That makes this a really great deal.
