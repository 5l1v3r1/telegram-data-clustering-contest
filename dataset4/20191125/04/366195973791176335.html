      <p>After teaming up with <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/bj-the-chicago-kid/profile">BJ The Chicago Kid</a> and brother Ro James on "go girl," crooner Luke James has returned to bless us with his newest "all of your love" track, another soulful cut designed to guide us toward his forthcoming t<i>o feel love/d</i> album.</p>
      <p>The cut was originally teased during the Soul Train Music Awards as the trio took to stage to deliver on a full rendition of "go girl." The track hosts a particularly nostalgic backdrop that boasts soundscapes popularized by soul and funk staples of the late 20th century. Paired with the sound heralded on "go girl", James is shaping up to create a formidable entry among top R&amp;B outputs when <i>to feel love/d</i> arrives in 2020.</p>
      <p>Until that arrives, enjoy "all of your love."</p>

      <p>You got the kinda loving<br/>That'll break a motherfuckers knees, baby<br/>Got me begging got me craving<br/>I just wanna get a squeeze baby</p>
