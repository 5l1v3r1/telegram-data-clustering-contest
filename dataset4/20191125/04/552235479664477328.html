      <p>SNP MPs are to make a fresh push for the UK Government to let legal drug consumption rooms be piloted in Scotland.</p>
      <p>With polls showing the SNP group could rise from 35 to 41 MPs at the General Election, Alison Thewliss, the party’s candidate for Glasgow Central, said there would be renewed pressure for devolving drugs laws.</p>

      <p>She said: “With a strong group of SNP MPs, we’ll be able to turn the heat up on the UK Government and demand vital action is taken to tackle addiction and drug-related deaths.</p>
      <p>“Devolve drugs law to the Scottish Parliament now so we can save lives before any more are lost.”</p>
      <p>Plans to pilot drug consumption rooms have the backing of a majority of MSPs and the SNP conference voted to back the Daily Record’s campaign to decriminalise drugs consumption and take a health approach to misuse.</p>

      <p>The call follows shock figures published this year that show there were 1187 drug-related deaths in Scotland in 2018 – 253 more deaths than in 2017 – an increase of 27 per cent.</p>
