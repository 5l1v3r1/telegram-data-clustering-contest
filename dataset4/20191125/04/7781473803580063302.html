      <p>Unlike the drivetrain options for the Seltos in India, the Chinese market only gets the 1.5-litre petrol engine mated to an eight-speed automatic gearbox which is not on offer in the Indian market. With a new gearbox married to the 1.5-litre naturally aspirated engine, the international spec Seltos has a claimed fuel efficiency of 18.51 kmpl. The peak power is rated at 115PS similar to the India spec Seltos. The Chinese spec Kia Seltos gets a front collision assist and an electronic parking brake.</p>
