      <p>One of the UK's first gay dads is planning to have twin girls with a man who once dated his daughter, according to a report.</p>
      <p>Barrie Drewitt-Barlow recently split from his husband Tony, 55, after falling in love with 25-year-old Scott Hutchinson.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old now wants to have daughters with his new partner through a surrogate mother.</p>
      <p>Mr Hutchinson was previously in a relationship with Mr Drewitt-Barlow's 19-year-old daughter Saffron.</p>
      <p>In a bizarre twist, the Drewitt-Barlows and Mr Hutchinson all currently live under the same roof. </p>
      <p>Mr Drewitt-Barlow said the set-up was 'unorthodox', however, he insisted it worked for his family.</p>

      <p>He told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7721011/Gay-dad-left-husband-daughters-ex-boyfriend-revealed-planning-TWINS.html">Mail Online</a> : "I don't want there to be any secrets and I want to get any negativity out of the way before our babies arrive."</p>
      <p>"Yes, it is unorthodox, but we are a loving family and our priority is to have a stable home for our kids and what is now an extended family.</p>

      <p>"It works for us – and if people are shocked, well that's their problem not ours."</p>
      <p>Mr Drewitt-Barlow and Tony were registered as parents in 1999 and lived in luxury in Florida, US, after making millions through their surrogate business.</p>
      <p>He has been in a platonic relationship with Tony since his cancer diagnosis in 2006.</p>

      <p>The businessman developed feelings for his assistant Mr Hutchinson when his husband was going through treatment.</p>
      <p>The youngster became a 'shoulder to cry on' as Tony, who is in remission, battled cancer.</p>
