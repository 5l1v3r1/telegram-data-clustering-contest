      <p>A former Hollywood stuntwoman has published a book about her memories of life growing up in Scotland.</p>
      <p>Maxie Reynolds, 31, who has also worked as an offshore pilot, has travelled the world since leaving <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dundee">Dundee</a> on the Silvery Tay as a teenager.</p>
      <p>She credits her “Scottish humour” as being the one thing that has helped her the most throughout her experiences.</p>
      <p>Maxie, who currently calls Los Angeles home, has also lived in Australia, Venezuela, Trinidad and Norway.</p>
      <p>Her book, A Guide To Surviving Childhood, takes a nostalgic look at her formative years in Dundee’s schemes.</p>

      <p>She said: “My mum had me when she was just 16 and so my childhood faced some  challenges that not every child did – but to me that was a normal, fun childhood.</p>
      <p>“The many hilarious things that happened in my house and my friends’ houses over the years still make me smile.</p>
      <p>Writing them down reinforced how great growing up is when you look back, whatever the circumstances.”</p>
      <p>Maxie added: “I wrote the book to produce laughter from people. Scottish humour is the best humour I’ve come across.</p>
      <p>“We laugh at things that probably shouldn’t be laughed at, joke about things that shouldn’t be joked about and we can do all of that at the same time as having the most serious of conversations, which is most definitely reflected in the book.</p>
      <p>“As an example, I once ran away from my mum on the street, got in the door of my aunt’s house, locked it and left her outside for what I thought would be hours… until she climbed up the drainpipe and in the upstairs window, took my victory biscuit from me and sat me outside for two hours to think about what I’d done.”</p>
      <p>Maxie said: “I think moving around Dundee a lot has <br/>made it second nature for me to get up and live and work <br/>in new places without any apprehension. My mum always, always told me – and continues to tell me – that I can do anything I put my mind to.</p>
      <p>“I think believing that has given me the confidence to tackle completely new areas and careers without caring what anyone else thinks.”</p>
      <p>A Guide to Surviving Childhood is out on Friday.</p>
