      <h1>Make Sure Your Romaine Lettuce Hasn't Been Recalled</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T04:59:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 04:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/author/emily-price" target="_blank">Emily Price</a></address>
      <p>Remember <a href="https://lifehacker.com/throw-away-all-your-romaine-lettuce-now-1830573843">all those romaine lettuce recalls from last year</a>? It’s happening again. The Centres for Disease Control is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2019/o157h7-11-19/index.html">advising consumers to not eat any romaine lettuce again</a>, specifically lettuce grown in Salinas, California.</p>
      <p>If you have romaine lettuce in your fridge, the CDC recommends tossing it if it says it was produced in Salinas or if the label doesn’t specifically note where the lettuce was packaged. The warning has also gone out to retailers to stop selling the lettuce and for restaurants to stop serving it.</p>
      <p>The USDA has also <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/7f4bf949-abbe-4bed-b1c9-9c9760c38c33/rc-115-2019-retail-list.pdf?MOD=AJPERES">recalled a motherload of specific products that contain romaine</a>.</p>
      <p>At least 40 people in 16 states have reportedly gotten sick due to a strain of E.coli traced back to the lettuce, 28 of those have been hospitalized.</p>
      <p>Symptoms of E.coli include cramps, diarrhoea, and vomiting.</p>
      <p>The recall includes all forms of romaine lettuce, including whole heads, chopped romaine, and pre-made salads and salad mixes that include romaine.</p>
      <p>Bottom line: If you have any romaine lettuce in your fridge and can’t tell where it was packaged, toss it. You might also want to avoid ordering romaine while you’re out and about for a bit in case the restaurant you’re at hasn’t heard of the recall or inadvertently serves you some contaminated lettuce.</p>
