      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T04:22:46+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 04:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>Actor Karthi’s latest release, Kaithi, is now streaming on Hotstar. Directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj of Managaram fame, the film opened to glowing reviews. One of the big Diwali releases, alongside Vijay-starrer Bigil, Kaithi also performed very well at the box-office.</p>
      <p>In Kaithi, Karthi essays the role of a convict who is ready to go to any lengths to see his daughter. The film also stars Narain and Dheena in pivotal roles. </p>
      <p>Reacting to concerns over the early release of Kaithi on a streaming platform, the film’s producer SR Prabhu tweeted, “I see lot of genuine concerns over the 30 day window for films in OTT while running successfully in BO. Theatrical audience will reduce eventually if we continue this trend!? Yes! But, piracy &amp; less terms from 3rd week can be compensated for producers only through this! #Kaithi”</p>
      <p>Upon Kaithi’s release, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">Indianexpress.com</a>’s critic Manoj Kumar R gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5. Praising the performance of Karthi in his review, Manoj wrote, “Karthi has essayed his role in an almost self-effacing manner while allowing space for other people’s acts of courage in the narration to get their due screen time. Kaithi is the director’s canvas. It is necessary to appreciate Karthi to let Lokesh do his thing without trying to bend the narration to suit his star image.”</p>
      <p>He continued, “Lokesh softly but firmly announces himself as a major new force in the commercial space of the Tamil film industry.”</p>
