      <h3>EVERY WORD FROM PEP</h3>
      <p>Pep Clotet was pleased with the character of his team - and Connal Trueman as the young goalkeeper played an important part in Birmingham City’s 1-1 draw at Huddersfield Town.</p>
      <p>They had to come from behind to claim it, though, after Frazier Campbell put the hosts ahead in the 55th minute.</p>
      <p>Lukas Jutkiewicz was on hand to deflect home Marc Roberts’ header with 12 minutes to go, which gave Clotet a point he felt his team merited.</p>

      <p>Danny Cowley could not hide his disappointment after his Huddersfield Town side let slip their lead against <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Blues went 1-0 down at the John Smith’s stadium but hit back with 12 minutes left when Lukas Jutkiewicz deflected home to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/huddersfield-town-birmingham-city-report-17303390">seal a 1-1 draw.</a></p>
      <p>Pep Clotet’s men are still searching to add to their two away wins this season, but they did end their four-game losing streak on the road with a point at the John Smith’s Stadium.</p>
      <p>Frazier Campbell had put Huddersfield ahead, but Cowley could “rest easy” after seeing how his players performed.</p>

      <h3>BIG QUESTION</h3>

      <p>Lukas Jutkiewicz’s fifth goal of the season gave <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> a hard fought draw at the John Smith’s Stadium.</p>
      <p>The striker deflected Dan Crowley’s free kick into the net after Blues had <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/huddersfield-town-birmingham-city-report-17303390">fallen behind to Frazier Campbell’s strike.</a></p>
      <p>This is what stood out on a wet, very November-like afternoon of Championship football.</p>

      <h3>CONNAL TRUEMAN VERDICT</h3>

      <p>Fifteen months ago the door to Birmingham City’s goal opened for Connal Trueman as Garry Monk gave the talented shot stopper his senior debut.</p>
      <p>Within a couple of games - and an ordeal by set-piece by Tony Pulis’ Middlesbrough, that door closed as Monk brought Lee Camp to the club, a brave move by Monk, one for a more experienced player who in some ways had as much to prove as his younger rival.</p>
      <p>Trueman remained behind that door - and Camp - for the next 44 Championship games, a young goalkeeper sitting on the bench, watching, learning - but most of all remaining ready for even the slightest chink of light. None came.</p>
      <p>He could have been forgiven for wondering if it would ever appear, particularly when in the summer Monk left and David Stockdale’s slate was wiped clean by Pep Clotet. As 2018/2019 clicked into 2019/2020 and a new name was pencilled on to the manager’s/head coach’s office, it looked as though Trueman had slipped down the pecking order, from second to third choice.</p>
      <p>Camp started the current campaign, Stockdale backed him up - and played in the final pre-season warm-up match as well as the Carabao Cup tie at Portsmouth, leaving Trueman scraping around for any kind of game-time.</p>
      <p>With a pair of veteran obstacles in his way it seemed obvious the 23-year-old should have gone out on loan instead of risking a wasted season, knocking on the door that would never budge and caught betwixt the first team and development squad.</p>
      <p>Yet in the last month Trueman was gone from third in line to first and on Saturday stepped through that door and into Blues’ starting line-up for just the third appearance of his career.</p>

      <p>Sheffield Wednesday look set to be without one of their key players when they face <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> this week.</p>
      <p>Blues take on the Owls at Hillsborough on Wednesday night in the Sky Bet Championship, and do so on the back of a draw.</p>
      <p>Pep Clotet’s side were held to a 1-1 stalemate with Huddersfield Town on Saturday, which leaves Blues in 15th place in the Championship table.</p>
      <p>Wednesday have been dealt a blow for the clash against Blues, with defender Liam Palmer set to miss the match due to suspension.</p>
      <p>Palmer received a straight red card in Wednesday’s 2-1 defeat to West Bromwich Albion at the weekend, and is set to serve a three-match ban.</p>
      <p>The Scotland international was given his marching orders after a challenge on West Ham loanee Grady Dianagana in the closing stages of the match at The Hawthorns.</p>
