      <p>A 42-year-old woman Temitope Akinola has been arrested by operatives of Ogun State police command for allegedly killing her two-year-old grand daughter.</p>
      <p>Akinola, a resident of Isote area of Shagamu was on November 21, 2019, arrested by detectives of Ogun State command for poisoning her grand daughter, which resulted in the death of the innocent baby.</p>
      <p>According to spokesman of the command, Abimbola Oyeyemi, “Her arrest followed information received by police in Shagamu division after the reported death of the child that the suspect, who has never hidden her hatred for her son-in-law who happened to be the father of the baby was the only person with the child while the baby’s mother went to take her birth, only for her to come back and met the lifeless body of the baby.</p>
      <p>“Upon the information, the DPO Shagamu division detailed his detectives to the scene, where the killer grandmother was promptly arrested.</p>
      <p>“On interrogation, the suspect admitted killing the baby because she didn’t like her daughter getting married to the father of the deceased baby. She confessed further that when she discovered that her daughter was pregnant, she made an attempt to terminate the pregnancy but her pastor warned her not to do so hence she waited for her to deliver before carrying out her devilish intention.</p>
      <p>“She explained further that she poisoned the baby with a deadly insecticide known as sniper. The body of the baby has been deposited at Olabisi Onabanjo teaching hospital mortuary for autopsy, while the suspect has been transferred to homicide section of the state criminal investigation and intelligence department for further investigation and prosecution”.</p>
