      <p>Shortly after the anticipated release of the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/off-white">Off-White™</a> x <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/nike-virgil-abloh-off-white-vapor-street-ow-athlete-in-progress-second-collection-release-information">Nike Zoom Vapor Street</a>, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/virgil-abloh">Virgil Abloh</a> has now teased the upcoming drop of his <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nike-dunk-low">Dunk Low</a> collaboration.</p>
      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5QfKTqpo9q/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading">Instagram</a>, the multi-disciplinary creative posted a photo of a pair of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/8/off-white-nike-dunk-low-pine-green-detailed-look">“Pine Green” Lows</a> he customized for pro skater <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/stevie-williams">Stevie Williams</a> who has already been seen <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5M8T5Oj9ki/">skating in a “University Red” iteration of the shoe</a>. Picking up the paint marker once again, Virgil marked the midsoles found on the shoes with “‘AIR’ WILLIAMS” and ‘VIRGIL ©2019.”</p>
      <p>Coming in three colorways, the low-cut shoes utilize a two-tone design constructed of premium leather accented by an exposed tongue and traditional lacing system paired with trail-like orange cord laces. Additional decorative detailing includes white zip-tie tags, orange tabs and “SHOELACES” printed laces. Branding comes in the form of midfoot Swooshes, industrial text printing, retro tongue tags and Nike printed at the heels. Rounding up the design of the shoes are white midsoles paired with contrasting rubber outsoles.</p>
