      <h1>Panjab University: 4 months after starting online portal, hostel allocation still full of problems</h1>
      <h2>The online portal, which was set up in July, was used by the latest batch of incoming students to register their request for a hostel, after securing admission into the university.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T04:18:04+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 04:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/chahat-rana/" target="_blank">Chahat Rana</a></address>
      <p>DESPITE THE online portal which was started in July this year, the process of hostel allocations at Panjab University remains inefficient and obscure, claim students.  “The portal is just another place to register your name for the hostel. After that, we have to run around campus submitting letters and asking different authorities to allot us a hostel room,” says Sebika, a second year student of MSc Geology from Assam who still hasn’t got a hostel room on campus.</p>
      <p>The online portal, which was set up in July, was used by the latest batch of incoming students to register their request for a hostel, after securing admission into the university. The aim of establishing the portal was to streamline the hostel allocation process and ensure transparency, since many believed hostels were often allocated unfairly.</p>
      <p>“Many students have already graduated and have jobs, but they are still living in hostels, while current students have to live in PGs at a price much higher than the hostel fees,” says Abhilash, an MA student of archaeology at the university. “There are clearly many rooms available. Even my room has space for another student. Then why aren’t hostels being allocated efficiently?”</p>
      <p>“See, there are no ex-students or alumni living in these facilities. Often these are kids who might be illegally living with their juniors, but they don’t have an official space, and are not taking a current student’s seat,” says Sanjeev Gautam, warden for Boys Hostel 3 at the university.</p>
      <p>According to Gautam, the hostel allocation process is clear, but it is the students who often cause some confusion.</p>
      <p>“They run between the DSW office and wardens. They say something to the DSW about how there is availability of hostels and make them sign the required documents, and then they come to us saying they have permission from DSW, hoping we will be pressured into allotting rooms to them. But we can only provide hostels if they are on top of the waiting list and rooms are available,” says Gautam.</p>
      <p>As of now, the typical journey for a student hoping to get a hostel room at PU begins with registering at the portal, followed by shuttling between various authorities and signing and submitting applications and letters, hoping they would get a room eventually. The portal can only be used to sign up for a hostel. It does not show where one is placed on the waiting list, nor does it say who has been allocated a hostel as of yet.</p>
      <p>Students approach the office of the Dean of Student Welfare to appeal for a room after being rejected from their particular department. After approaching DWS, they make their last appeals to hostel wardens. “I am authorised a seat under the Scheduled Tribes reservation quota. But this year, instead of two seats for STs, my department had only one. So I haven’t received a hostel room as of yet. My department has flatly denied a chance of me receiving a hostel room, and now I am residing with distant family in New <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a>,” says Stanzin, a first year student enrolled in MA Geography course.</p>
      <p>Another student who is eligible to get a room under the ST quota says he has been looking for a hostel room for the past one year and a half but to no avail. The student, who wishes to remain anonymous because he is now residing illegally in a hostel, says he was notified he has been allocated a hostel by his department, but when he went to claim the room, the warden told him there was no room available. “Now I am going through the same process of going from one place to another, getting documents signed. There seems to be no co-ordination between the different authorities. One says something, another says something else. As for the online portal, it’s just a farce. It adds to our problems,” he says.</p>
      <p>“The portal is new and has its problems, but anything new takes time to become functional,” says Dean of Student Welfare Emanual Nahar. “There is a merit list for students in the general category and that is what is used as a waiting list for hostel allocation. There is a separate list for reserved categories which is maintained for each department. There is no discrepancy in allocation. Students just have to be patient with the new portal,” says Nahar.</p>
      <p>“We have come here from so far, some of us from thousands of kilometres away. They can at least prioritise students who have left their homes and come so far to study. It is so alienating to stay outside, that too at a higher cost,” says Sebika, the MA student from Assam.</p>
