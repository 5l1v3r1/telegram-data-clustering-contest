      <p>Lenovo has officially launched ThinkBook 14 and ThinkBook 15 notebooks in Malaysia. First unveiled at IFA 2019 earlier this year, the notebooks is both designed and catered towards Lenovo’s SMB segment that prioritise portability, performance, and battery life above everything else.</p>
      <p>Specs-wise, both the ThinkBook 14 and ThinkBook 15 shared near identical hardware, the obvious difference with their display sizes notwithstanding. Both notebooks can be fitted with up to the latest 10th generation Intel Core i7 CPU and up to 24GB DDR4 RAM. For storage, users have a choice of up to a 2TB HDD, an NVMe PCIe SSD of up to 1TB, or a combination of the two storage devices.</p>

      <p>Additionally, there’s also an option to include an Intel Optane M15 or H10 module for an extra added speed boost in load times. The latter option also including an 500GB SSD. On a side note, both the ThinkBook 14 and 15 will use the onboard Intel UHD integrated graphics by default, but Lenovo is offering consumers the option of having an AMD Radeon 625 discrete GPU.</p>
      <p>Battery life is and always has been an important, if not crucial factor for business-grade notebooks. To that end, neither ThinkBooks disappoint; Lenovo offers consumers a choice between a 45WHr and 57WHr battery. The former promising up to nine hours of continuous use on a single charge, while the latter reportedly providing up to 12 hours of continuous use. Regardless of battery size, both variants come Rapid Charge support.</p>
