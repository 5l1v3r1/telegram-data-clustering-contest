      <p>SANTA CLARA, Calif. — <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jimmy-garoppolo">Jimmy Garoppolo</a> threw two long touchdown passes and San Francisco's defense harassed <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/aaron-rodgers">Aaron Rodgers</a> all night, leading the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers">49ers</a> to a 37-8 victory over the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/green-bay-packers">Green Bay Packers</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Garoppolo connected on a <a href="https://twitter.com/49ers/status/1198795590722715648?s=20">42-yard touchdown strike to Deebo Samuel</a> in the second quarter and a <a href="https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1198806912189362176?s=20">61-yarder to George Kittle</a> in the third to get San Francisco (10-1) off to a resounding start to a grueling three-game stretch.</p>

      <p>Following the game against the first-place Packers (8-3), the Niners will travel to Baltimore (8-2) and New Orleans (9-2) the next two weeks in a stretch that will go a long way to determining whether San Francisco will be able to hold off Seattle (9-2) in a tight NFC West race.</p>

      <p>Rodgers <a href="https://twitter.com/49ers/status/1198775549558050823?s=20">lost a fumble</a> on the opening drive one of the five sacks he took and failed to convert a single third down on 13 tries before getting pulled late in the fourth quarter. He finished 20 for 33 for 104 yards and Green Bay averaged an anemic 1.7 yards per pass play when he was in the game.</p>
      <p>After allowing 78 points the past three weeks in two games against Arizona's Kyler Murray and one against Seattle's Russell Wilson, the Niners’ defense was <a href="https://twitter.com/49ers/status/1198796783880523776?s=20">back to its dominant form</a>.</p>
      <p>San Francisco allowed 198 yards on 70 plays, didn't allow a single completion longer than 15 yards and got a key stop against Aaron Jones on a fourth-and-1 run in the first half when the outcome was still in doubt.</p>

      <p>Garoppolo then put it away with the two long touchdowns, part of a day when he went 14 for 20 for 253 yards and most importantly committed no turnovers.</p>
      <p>He was helped by the return of Kittle, who had six catches for 129 yards in his first game back after missing the past two contests with injuries to his knee and ankle.</p>
