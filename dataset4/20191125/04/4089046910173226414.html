      <p>Willie Murphy, 82, says a man knocked on the door to her home late Thursday night, claiming he was sick and needed an ambulance. She called police but didn’t let him in.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, Murphy heard a loud noise.</p>
      <p>“I’m saying to myself, 'What the heck is that?’ The young man is in my home, broke the door,” she said.</p>
      <p>But what the suspect likely didn’t realize is Murphy is an award-winning bodybuilder, who works out at the YMCA almost every day. She grabbed a nearby table.</p>
      <p>"I'm alone, and I'm old but guess what? I'm tough,” Murphy said. "I took that table, and I went to working on him. And guess what? The table broke.”</p>
      <p>Once the man was injured, Murphy says she poured shampoo on his face and hit him with a broom.</p>
      <p>“When he's down, I'm jumping on him,” she said. “He picked the wrong house to break into.”</p>
      <p>When officers arrived minutes later, it wasn’t Murphy who needed medical attention.</p>
      <p>"He's laying down already because I had really did a number on that man,” Murphy said.</p>
      <p>The suspect, who police say was intoxicated, was taken to the hospital. Murphy is not pressing charges.</p>
      <p>Jim Marron has been friends with the 82-year-old for over a decade, and he’s not surprised she held her own.</p>
      <p>"I probably weigh close to twice as much as her. I wouldn't want to tango with her. Don't mess with Willie,” he said.</p>
      <p>Murphy says she can deadlift 225 pounds. She hopes her story inspires people of all ages.</p>
