      <h1>West Bengal by-polls: 30.17% votes till 11 am</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T04:23:10+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 04:23</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>About 30.17 per cent of over seven lakh electorate on Monday exercised their franchise in the by-polls to three Assembly seats in West Bengal till 11 am, an EC official said.</p>
      <p>Kharagpur Sadar Assembly constituency, having 2.25 lakh voters, registered 28 per cent polling in the first four hours, the official said.</p>
      <p>Both Kaliaganj with 2.69 electors, and Karimpur with 2.4 lakh electorate recorded 31.25 per cent votes, he said.</p>
      <p>Voting is underway in 801 polling stations of the three constituencies amid strict security arrangements.</p>
      <p>Over seven lakh people are eligible to decide the fate of 18 candidates in the three constituencies.</p>
      <p>In Karimpur Assembly seat, Trinamool Congress (TMC) supporters raised ‘go back’ slogans when BJP candidate and vice-president of the West Bengal unit of the party, Jay Prakash Majumdar tried to enter a booth. The police resorted to baton charge to disperse the mob.</p>
      <p>Local TMC leaders accused Majumdar of vitiating the peaceful atmosphere.</p>
      <p>In Kaliaganj constituency, BJP candidate Kamal Chandra Sarkar was seen helping his wife to cast her vote. The TMC has lodged a complaint with the Election Commission and the poll panel said, it is looking into the allegation.</p>
      <p>Two of the three Assembly constituencies - Kharagpur Sadar and Karimpur - fell vacant post general election as the sitting MLAs contested and won Lok Sabha seats.</p>
      <p>By-polls were necessitated in Kaliaganj following the death of Congress MLA Parmathanath Roy.</p>
      <p>Congress nominee Dhitashree Roy, supported by the CPI (M), is pitted against TMC’s Tapan Deb Sinha and BJP’s Kamal Chandra Sarkar in Kaliaganj.</p>
      <p>In Karimpur, vacated by MLA Mahua Moitra after emerging victorious from Krishnnanagar Lok Sabha seat, the CPI(M)-Congress candidate Gholam Rabbi is contesting against BJP’s Jay Prakash Majumdar and TMC’s Bimalendu Singha Roy.</p>
      <p>Prem Chandra Jha of the BJP is pitted against Chittaranjan Mandal of the Congress-CPI(M) alliance and Pradip Sarkar of the TMC in Kharagpur Sadar Assembly seat - vacated by MLA Dilip Ghosh after winning Medinipur Lok Sabha seat.</p>
      <p>The by-polls are expected to be a litmus test for the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the BJP - which emerged as a main opposition in the state after the Lok Sabha polls earlier this year - ahead of 2021 state elections.</p>
      <p>The Congress and the CPI(M-led Left Front, which have been pushed to distant third and fourth in the state, are contesting the by-polls after entering into an electoral alliance.</p>
      <p>The results will be declared on November 28.</p>
