      <p>A human resource outsourcing firm, Whyte Cleon Limited, has exonerated First BanK Plc of violation of labour laws.</p>
      <p>The National Union of Banks, Insurance and Financial Institution Employee (NUBIFIE) last week accused the bank of planning to sack about 1,000 employees without following the due process.</p>
      <p>Managing Director of the firm, Mrs. Nireti Abebayo, said: “That is not true. I am just hearing it for the first time. I am not aware of any meeting from the Labour Ministry and unions. No letter was written to us.”</p>
