      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/jawaharlal-nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> University (JNU) has set up a high-level committee to get “suggestions from student representatives” to find a solution to the ongoing hostel fee hike protests. The circular issued on Sunday, however, was not sent to the four JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) office bearers.</p>
      <p>The move comes at a time when the Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry-appointed high-powered committee, set up to look into restoring normalcy on campus, is yet to submit its report in the matter. It is likely to be submitted Monday.</p>
      <p>In the circular, Registrar Pramod Kumar said the deadline to submit suggestions was till 5.30 pm Sunday. The university has kept the JNUSU out of meetings, claiming that it had not yet been “notified” due to violation of Lyngdoh Committee Regulations during elections.</p>
      <p>“This is for the information of all concerned that a High-Level Committee has been constituted by the competent authority to get suggestions from student representatives on finding a solution to the hostel issues,” Kumar said in the circular, adding that the suggestions had to be sent to Dean of Students (DoS) Umesh Kadam “before 5.30 pm” on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The committee comprises seven members, all members of the administration, and is chaired by Rector III Rana P Singh. The other members include the DoS, the Associate DoS, one of the five Provosts, and Deans of three schools which include the School of International Studies, School of Sanskrit and Indic Studies, and School of Biotechnology.</p>
      <p>JNUSU vice-president Saket Moon said the circular was sent to hostel presidents, and “a few JNUSU councillors”, some of whom replied to Kadam with JNUSU’s official stand.</p>
      <p>“The level of shamelessness with this administration continues to rise wherein the mail has not been sent to the JNUSU, even as government-appointed committees… recognise the legitimacy of the elected union,” said the JNUSU.</p>
      <p>“We respectfully submit before the esteemed committee that its very formation is but an act of subverting the IHA (Inter-Hall Administration) Committee, which is a statutory body unto itself… It is the IHA Committee, and not a group of arbitrarily chosen members of the faculty with obvious vested interests, which has the mandate to look into issues concerning the hostels,” it added.</p>
      <p>The JNUSU said the “only means by which the current impasse” could be broken was by “an unequivocal revocation of the IHA Manual “passed by the IHA Committee on October 28”, in which fee hike was also passed. It also reiterated the demand for the V-C’s resignation.</p>
      <p>Kadam did not respond to calls and texts asking if suggestions had been received by other hostel presidents or councillors.</p>
