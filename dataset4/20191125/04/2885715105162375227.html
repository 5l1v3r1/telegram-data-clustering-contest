        <figcaption>Voting was underway Sunday in Hong Kong elections that have become a barometer of public support for anti-government protests now in their sixth month. Long lines formed outside polling stations for 452 seats in the city’s 18 district councils. The councils are largely advisory and have little power. But the election has taken on symbolic importance in the semiautonomous Chinese territory. (AP)</figcaption>
