      <h1>'Our alliances will be completely fractured': Biden claims ‘there will be no NATO’ if Trump wins second term</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:14:38+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:14</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Simonson</a></address>
      <p>Joe Biden told supporters at a Providence, Rhode Island fundraiser that President Trump's reelection would result in the end of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a mutual defense agreement between the United States, and a number of its allies.</p>
      <p>"I truly believe that there will be no NATO. Our alliances will be completely fractured. They're already being hurt," the former vice president said Sunday evening to a group of wealthy donors, according to a pool report.</p>
      <p>Biden, 77, then went on to claim that Trump runs his foreign policy "like a protection racket: 'unless you do the following, we are going to, in fact, not keep our sacred commitment,'" before saying that he believes he's "the best equipped" to restore America's alliances.</p>
      <p>Trump has <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-i-know-more-about-nato-than-defense-secretary-jim-mattis">repeatedly attacked NATO</a>, starting with his initial run for the Republican nomination in 2016 when he labeled the treaty "obsolete." Since taking office, he has demanded European nations meet their required defense spending as stipulated by the agreement.</p>
      <p>In private, Trump has toyed with the idea of <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-repeatedly-said-in-private-he-wanted-us-to-leave-nato-report">leaving NATO entirely</a> out of frustration that European nations repeatedly fail to meet their obligations.</p>
      <p>Even before announcing his third White House run, Biden has used Trump's rhetoric towards America's allies as examples that he is unfit for office.</p>
      <p>"The America I see values basic human decency, not snatching children from their parents or turning our back on refugees at our border. Americans know that’s not right,” he <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/biden-tells-europeans-in-munich-that-america-is-an-embarrassment">said in February</a> at the Munich Security Conference. "The American people understand plainly that this makes us an embarrassment. The American people know, overwhelmingly, that it is not right. That it is not who we are."</p>
