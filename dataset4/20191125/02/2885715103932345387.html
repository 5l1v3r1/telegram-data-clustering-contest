      <p>A batch of 30 recruit religious teachers (RRTs) were commissioned as Junior Commissioned Officers on Saturday after a passing out parade was held at the Institute of National Integration (INI). Brigadier Samir Salunke, Commandant of the Institute, reviewed the parade.</p>
      <p>Brig Salunke awarded General Officer Commanding in Chief, Army Training Command and INI Commandant’s gold and silver medals to Naib Subedar (RT) Manish Sharma of Light Infantry Regimental Centre and Naib Subedar (RT) Suneel Kumar of 2 Army Service Corps Regimental Centre, respectively, who distinguished themselves in 11 weeks of training.</p>
      <p>Salunke congratulated the commissioned JCOs and their parents in attendance, for successful completion of the pre-commissioning training incorporating subjects related to national integration, behaviour and social science, including spiritualism, yoga, psychological counselling and stress management.</p>
      <p>The RTs passing out from INI were considered optimally ready to perform assigned duties of dharma guru and shoulder additional responsibilities of psychological counselor and mental health mentor in stress-related environmental dynamics, across varied and harsh terrain along northern and eastern borders. Salunke said these RTs play a very important role in building up morale and motivation among troops and their families. INI, as a premier training institution established in 1984, serves as a nodal centre for behaviour and social sciences. The passing out recruits are inducted as JCOs with designations like pandits, maulavis, priests, monks or granthis.</p>
