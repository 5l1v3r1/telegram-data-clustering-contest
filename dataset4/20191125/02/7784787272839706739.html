      <p>Tasmanian-born, Brisbane-based Titmus already had plenty to celebrate in a breakout 2019 after famously dethroning American great Katie Ledecky to claim 400m freestyle gold at this year’s world titles in South Korea in July.</p>
      <p>It marked the first time Ledecky - a 14-time world champion - had been beaten over 400m, 800m or 1500m freestyle at a major international meet since 2012.</p>
      <p>Titmus also became the first Australian to win the world 400m title since Tracey Wickham back in 1978.</p>

      <p>Titmus also inspired Australia’s 4x200m freestyle gold at Gwangju, claimed in a new world record as part of her four medal haul in South Korea.</p>
      <p>Their time eclipsed China’s 2009 supersuit world record mark by 0.58 of a second and also marked the first time Australia had claimed the women’s 4x200m relay world title.</p>
      <p>Titmus’ heroics helped Australia finish second overall on the world titles medal tally behind the all conquering Americans.</p>
      <p>The teenager sounded her intentions for 2019 by claiming 400m freestyle gold at the world short course titles in yet another world record time and winning the 200m final.</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly Titmus’s mentor, St Peters Western’s Dean Boxall was named Coach of the Year and Youth Coach of the Year for 2019 in Sydney on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Kareena Lee - the first Australian swimmer selected on the 2020 Tokyo Olympic team - was named Open Water Swimmer of the Year after her top 10 finish in the women’s 10km Open event at the world titles.</p>
