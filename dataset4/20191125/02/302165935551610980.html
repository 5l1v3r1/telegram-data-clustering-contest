      <p>SEOUL, Nov 25 — Following the sudden death of K-pop star Goo Hara yesterday, #Punish_Choi_Jong_Bum has become the top hashtag trend on Twitter in South Korea.</p>
      <p>Choi, who is a hairdresser, is the former boyfriend of Goo with whom she became embroiled in a revenge porn case, after a messy break-up, in which each accused the other of assault.</p>
      <p>It forced her to put her entertainment career on hold late last year.</p>
      <p>Last September, Choi contacted news outlets over a video that he claimed would “end (Goo’s) entertainment career”.</p>
      <p>He eventually did not leak it.</p>
      <p>But in August, he was given a suspended jail term by a lower court on account of the threat and other forms of criminal behaviour.</p>
      <p>Goo then filed an appeal in September for the Seoul District Court’s initial ruling that found him guilty of assault.</p>
      <p>Choi, whose sentence involved crimes of property damages, physical assault, threats and unnecessary force, was not found guilty of sexual assault in the form of illegal footage filming.</p>
      <p>The case led to intense online rumours and hate comments against Goo.</p>
      <p>In South Korea, female victims are generally under pressure not to report sex crimes.</p>
      <p>In May, Goo was found unconscious at her home following a suicide attempt.</p>
      <p>The former member of girl group Kara was found dead at her home in Seoul yesterday, South Korean police confirmed.</p>
      <p>The exact cause of death was still under investigation, they added.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old’s death comes a month after Sulli — another K-pop star and Goo’s close friend — took her own life after a long struggle with online bullying.</p>
      <p>The singer had posted a tearful message on her Instagram shortly after Sulli’s death, grieving the passing of her friend.</p>
