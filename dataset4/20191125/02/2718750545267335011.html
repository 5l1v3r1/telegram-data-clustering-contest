      <h1>Kesha Reminds the Children What the One True ‘Tik Tok’ Is at the 2019 AMAs</h1>

      <p>Because the party truly does not stop. <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/kesha/">Kesha</a> and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/big-freedia/">Big Freedia</a> slipped on their sensual color-coordinated satin pajamas and brought you their version of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/sunday-service/">Sunday Service</a> at tonight’s American Music Awards, performing their new song “<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/kesha-raising-hell-new-music-video-big-freedia.html">Raising Hell</a>” from Kesha’s upcoming album <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/kesha-releases-new-album-trailer-for-high-road.html"><i>High Road</i></a> with a hot-pink midriff-bearing choir. But if that wasn’t enough evangelizing for Kesha’s enduring music legacy, the singer then launched into a rendition of her 2009 smash-hit “Tik Tok,” reminding the kids ten years on what the true Tik Tok is, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/tik-tok/">no matter what app tries to steal its name</a> or permanently mess up its SEO. Plus, if you watch the performance below, you’ll also see Taran Killam, formerly of S<i>aturday Night Live</i> and currently of ABC’s <i>Single Parents</i> ergo his AMAs presenting gig, have an extremely appropriate reaction to the song.</p>
