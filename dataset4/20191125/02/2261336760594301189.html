      <p>On February 8, 2020, the UFC’s light heavyweight champion, Jon Jones, is <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/22/20978438/jon-jones-vs-dominick-reyes-official-feb-8-ppv-ufc-246-247-mma-news">officially scheduled</a> to defend his crown against undefeated challenger, Dominick Reyes. Bloody Elbow is here to provide you with the opening betting lines.</p>
      <p>Online gambling site <a href="https://mobile.sportsbetting.ag/sports/offerings?s=Martial%20Arts&amp;l=MMA&amp;p=0">SportsBetting.ag</a> has just dropped the initial moneylines for this upcoming 205-pound title fight. Outside of Daniel Cormier and Alexander Gustafsson, the defending champ traditionally opens up with a stout minus line. This time around is no exception. Jones is starting out as a -300 betting favorite, with a +240 comeback on his much less experienced opposition in Reyes.</p>
      <p>The 12-0 Reyes will experience life as a betting underdog for the first time in his career. Thus far, his moneylines have ranged anywhere from -405 up to -165. Considering he is taking on the light heavyweight G.O.A.T. it’s no surprise to see him owning a thick plus line here. It is Jon Jones after all. Asa of the time this article was written, no prop bets have been released. Stay tuned to Bloody Elbow for those upcoming exotics to drop in the near future.</p>
