      <p>DOHA: Qatar Trade Summit, which will bring together business leaders from across the world to advance Qatar’s vision for trade and business excellence globally, will open today at the InterContinental Doha The City. The three-day event will host global thought leaders, industry stakeholders and experts from the fields of sea ports, air cargo, supply chain and logistics.</p>

      <p>Speaking about the challenges and business climate in the Middle East and in Qatar, James Baker, Editor at the UK-based Llyods List Container, said: “Despite the challenges facing the global container shipping sector, the Middle East is emerging as one of the bright spots. Transported volumes are increasing and global carriers are adding more services to the region as demand rises. The region’s strategic location on the midway point of China’s ambitious Belt and Road project has led to increased interest in container terminal developments. In the first nine months of this year alone, Qatari ports saw volumes rise by 2 percent to over 1m teu.”</p>
      <p>Bertrand Maltaverne, Solutions Consultant at Austria-based Ivaula Inc, added: “The Logistics market in Qatar is at a growth stage and a steady one at that for the last 5-10 years, with the new expansion plans in the country, the upcoming major Q22 event, and the ambitious plans of the Qatari leadership to grow the country into a new regional logistical hub, and a major global LNG supplier”.</p>
      <p>Amadou Diallo, CEO for DHL Global Forwarding, Middle East &amp; Africa, said: “I am personally convinced that Qatar will become a global technology and life sciences and healthcare logistics hub for time and temperature sensitive goods, thanks to its airports and logistics infrastructure. Qatar will become a global platform for “Connecting People, Improving lives”.</p>
