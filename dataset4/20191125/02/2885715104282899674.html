        <b>SSC CGL 2019: Eligibility</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> From 2018 onwards, the age limit to apply for the SSC CGL has been lowered to 18 years. Earlier the minimum age limit for the recruitment test was used to be 20 years. The change is expected to be implemented this year as well, however, the eligibility will be cleared once the official website will display the notification.</p>
      <p><b>Education qualification:</b> Based on previous trends, candidates who have cleared the graduation level (any course) of education from a recognised institute can appear for the recruitment exam.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/jobs/ssc-cgl-2019-check-syllabus-paper-pattern-in-detail-ssc-nic-in-6132097/">examination </a>consisted of 100 questions bearing two marks and a negative marking of 0.50 marks for every incorrect answer. The section was arranged in the ascending order beginning with reasoning and ended with English. Those who clear the tier I exam will have to appear for tier-II, tier-III and skill test.</p>
      <p>Those who clear all the legs of the recruitment process will be hired at group B and C level posts across government departments and organisations. Candidates hired in group B level posts will get a pay band of Rs 9,300 – Rs 34,800 and those hired in group C level posts will get Rs 5,200 to Rs 20,200.</p>
