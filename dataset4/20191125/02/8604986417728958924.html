      <h3>1. Custom Golf Clubs by Parsons Xtreme Golf</h3>

      <p>The first thing GoDaddy founder and self-made billionaire Bob Parsons wants you to know is: "I'm an avid golfer, and I tend to center my business around things I enjoy doing." One night in 2013, when sharing ideas about what might make golf equipment better with an executive friend who worked at a leading manufacturer, Parsons realized the conversation kept stalling out around profit margins and price-point limitations. "I wondered, what if I started a company and we never had any constraints?" Two years later, PXG debuted its first generation of clubs, which go for $400 a piece and are built by hand, as well as customized to individual golfers. For Parsons, this is just the beginning. "How many people have a baby and think it's the most beautiful thing in the world?" he asks. "Our job is to get away from the new-baby thinking and look honestly at what can be improved." <i>--Kate Rockwood </i></p>
      <h3>2. Barefoot Running Shoes by Xero Shoes</h3>

      <p>Longtime sprinter Steven Sashen couldn't shake his near-constant running injuries. After reading the 2009 ethnography<b> </b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Born-Run-Hidden-Superathletes-Greatest/dp/0307279189"><i>Born To Run</i></a> by Christopher McDougall, which highlights the benefits of running barefoot, Sashen started to think that maybe his shoes were the culprit. In 2010, he and his wife Lena Phoenix launched <a href="http://www.inc.com/profile/xero-shoes">Xero Shoes</a> to mimic the effect of running barefoot. The founders appeared on <i>Shark Tank</i> in 2013 and walked away from a $400,000 offer from Kevin O'Leary. That appearance still did wonders for the Broomfield, Colorado company, which booked $8.8 million in 2018, selling products like the $89.99 men's Prio running and fitness shoe.</p>
      <h3>3. All-Natural Soap for Men by Dr. Squatch</h3>

      <p>Jack Haldrup was in search for some all-natural soap when he realized that none of it was marketed toward men. In 2013, he turned his garage soap-making operation into <a href="https://www.inc.com/profile/dr-squatch">Dr. Squatch</a>, and began selling soaps, featuring scents more typically associated with men like cedar citrus and spearmint basil. The San Diego company's grooming products, which now include shaving kits, shampoo, and beard oil generated $5 million in revenue last year--helping it mark its second consecutive year on the Inc. 5000. Customers can also buy "soapscription" boxes that deliver homemade soap each month, or buy products individually. A bar of Dr. Squatch soap retails for $7 apiece.</p>
      <h3>4. Insulated Wine Cups by Swig</h3>

      <p>Tracee Mathe's Richmond, Virginia-based <a href="https://www.inc.com/profile/swig">Swig</a> has been around since 2008, but the business didn't really take off until 2017 when the company launched its stemless, insulated wine cup, which costs $27.95 on Swig's website. Mathe felt like there wasn't enough feminine drinkware on the market and sought to create containers to change that. Today, her tumblers and mugs, with their signature colorful designs, are a fan favorite--reeling in $17.7 million in 2018 revenue. Recently, Mathes launched reusable straws, coolers, and insulated lunchboxes. </p>
      <h3>5. UpCart by TriFold</h3>

      <p>Baby-stroller wheels and a repurposed cart chassis that looked like it was held together by duct tape and glue--that's what Michael Reznik found himself looking at when, at a birthday party, a family friend shared a photo of his stair-climbing, fold-flat handcart prototype. "It looked like some Frankenstein contraption, but I saw there were a thousand potential applications for it," says Reznik, who'd built a career helping Fortune 500 companies with process improvement. Post-soiree, he and Leonid Khodor, a patent agent, became business partners, launching <a href="https://www.inc.com/profile/trifold">TriFold</a> and its debut product, the UpCart. Today, the carts, which cost $99.99, are a hit with parents, seniors, urban grocery shoppers, contractors--and pretty much all those who want to schlep stuff from one place to another without breaking their backs.<i> --Kate Rockwood </i></p>
      <h3>6. Flash Kit by MagMod</h3>

      <p>2019 Inc. 5000 rank <b>No. 1319</b> | Three-year growth <b>311%</b> | 2018 revenue <b>$5.6M</b></p>
      <p>After a long day photographing a wedding, Spencer Boerup designed a prototype of better flash equipment that's easier to transport and faster to put together with magnets--instead of traditional Velcro, straps, or adhesives. He then took his idea to Kickstarter in 2013, and his <a href="https://www.inc.com/profile/magmod">MagMod</a> professional flash kit, which costs $189.95, reached its $35,000 funding goal in less than five hours. The Tucson, Arizona-based company's three-year revenue jumped more than 300 percent to $5.6 million in annual revenue last year.</p>
      <h3>7. Gourmet Dog Food by I and Love and You</h3>

      <p>2019 Inc. 5000 rank <b>No. 3684</b> | Three-year growth <b>94%</b> | 2018 revenue <b>$22.2M</b></p>
      <p>Pet industry and consumer product veterans Chris Bentley, Steve Ball, Marty Grosjean, and Brendan Synnott started selling their Boulder, Colorado-based brand of <a href="https://www.inc.com/profile/i-and-love-and-you">gourmet dog food</a> in 2012. The premium product, which is produced under the guidance of a holistic veterinarian, is made from meat and raw ingredients, unlike the filler and grains<b> </b>sometimes used by other brands. After launching in Whole Foods, the brand started selling on Amazon and online pet retailer Chewy in 2015. Last year, the company generated $22.2 million in revenue from a portfolio of over 100 products ranging from dry cat food to beef ear chews for dogs. </p>

      <p>"When you're 15 and trying to figure out how to get and keep a girlfriend, showing up to school sweaty every day is tough," says Mike Radenbaugh. He should know: As a high school freshman in a small rural town in California, his commute was 17 hilly miles on his own horsepower. So, in 2007, the teen converted his road bike to an electric ride, with the help of a lead-acid battery, a brush motor, and a bit of Tupperware. Word spread, and Raden­baugh sold converted bikes. Fast-forward to 2015, when he relaunched <a href="https://www.inc.com/profile/rad-power-bikes">Rad Power Bikes</a> with childhood friend Ty Collins and college pal Marimar White-Espin. "I had to drop the traditional thought process about adding a motor to a regular bike," he says. "Electric bikes are for replacing cars--we start there, and then think through all the features, from handlebars to hauling." <i>--Kate Rockwood </i></p>
      <h3>9. Try Out Engagement Rings by With Clarity</h3>

      <p>When it comes to popping the question, only 14 percent of grooms buy engagement rings online. "People still want to look at and touch and feel the ring, which might be one of the biggest purchases they've made," says Anubh Shah, a third-generation diamond jeweler. Shah thought he could bring more transparency to the online experience and help calm consumers' cold feet by letting them try on 3-D-printed replicas at home before committing to the real bling. "This isn't an industry you can just walk into one morning," says Shah, whose diamond-dealing dad immigrated from India to America with $5,000 in his pocket. "But I didn't want to constantly do the same thing. I think every generation feels the need to reinvent how business gets done." <i>--Kate Rockwood </i></p>

      <p>When the father-and-son duo Daniel and Paul Kane went looking for a slimmer, more durable alternative to traditional leather wallets, they noted a dearth of options. In true entrepreneur fashion, they decided to build their own--outfitted with carbon fiber, aluminum, and titanium. Borrowing from Daniel's previous experience selling <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/339367">retrofit Rock Band drumkits through Reddit while he was still a teenager</a>, the two introduced the <a href="https://www.inc.com/profile/ridge-wallet">Ridge Wallet</a> as a Kickstarter campaign in 2013. The project outperformed its funding goal of $14,000, reaching almost $127,000 in pledges before closing orders. Today, its titanium wallet goes for $105 on the company's website, where it also sells sturdy backpacks, chargers, and phone cases.</p>

      <p>Appearing on the Inc. 5000 for the third year in a row is <a href="https://www.inc.com/profile/darn-good-yarn">Darn Good Yarn</a>, which sells yarn, clothing, and home goods nationwide from its homebase in Clifton Park, New York. Founded by Nicole Snow in 2008, the company today operates both an online store and a factory outlet in town; it also sells goods wholesale to other retailers. The company's ethical mission is the real draw: It supports sustainable sourcing and fair employment standards among its vendors. The yarn is pretty neat, too. A bundle costs $10.99 to $35 and comes in a variety of materials including cotton, wool, silk, and linen. The business booked $7.1 million in revenue last year.</p>

      <p>When U.S. Navy veteran John Lyles couldn't find a good electric shaver for his head, he teamed up with U.S. Air Force veteran Neel Kulshreshtha to design and patent their own device. Enter the cordless Skull Shaver, which they started selling on Amazon in 2012 and today costs $199 on the company's website. The Moorestown, New Jersey-based company, also called <a href="https://www.inc.com/profile/skull-shaver">Skull Shaver</a>, also sells clippers, travel cases, and portable chargers.</p>

      <p>When Ben and Laura Harrison's son Jonas was born blind, navigating 21 eye surgeries and four corneal transplants was beyond overwhelming. Where could Ben, who worked as a graphic designer and photographer, exert some control? "If Jonas was going to need glasses, I wanted him to look like a little stud," says Ben of his son, now age 6. Ben started designing frames himself, and used personal savings to manufacture prototypes. The startup's breakthrough came in 2015, when the co-founders connected with the former CEO of LensCrafters, who offered them seed funding. Suddenly, the Harrisons could fill prescriptions in-house instead of mailing parents empty frames, and launch try-on kits for consumers. "That," says Ben, "was our pivotal moment." <i>--Kate Rockwood </i></p>

      <p>Before founding <a href="https://www.inc.com/profile/bbq-guys-manufacturing">Blaze Grills</a> in 2012, Mike Hackley spent about 20 years installing and building outdoor kitchens. Today, his Baton Rouge, Louisiana-based company, which booked $34.9 million in annual sales last year, focuses on outdoor gas and charcoal grills. The Portable Gas Grill, which costs $749.99, is made of stainless steel, has a propane hookup, and comes with a flame-thrower ignition system, as well as a lifetime warranty. Hackley says he currently is working on 15 new products.</p>

      <p>After studying tile making in Italy and working in other tile studios, Mercedes Austin decided to start her own venture in 2002. She took her tax refund and sold her jazz CD collection and used the money to buy her first kiln. Shortly thereafter she launched ceramic tile factory and showroom <a href="https://www.inc.com/profile/Mercury-Mosaics">Mercury Mosaics</a>. Each clay tile is made in a 15,000-square-foot factory located in Minneapolis and then sold directly to consumers via its own in-house team and showroom. The company's iconic fish scale tiles cost $49 to $156 per square foot. </p>

      <p>Each time his significant other received her monthly Birchbox order, Daniel Dabbs noted the joy with which she opened her packages. He realized he (and many others like him) might feel the same way about monthly subscription boxes if they contained survival gear.  After teaming up with college friends Patrick Kelley and John Roman in 2015, the Milledgeville, Georgia-based <a href="https://www.inc.com/profile/battlbox">BattlBox</a> was born. Its monthly subscription boxes contain outdoor, camping, and survival gear like a portable butane camp stove and a machete. BattlBox's "basic" box costs $29.99 per month, while a "pro plus" box is $149.99 per month. The company has delivered more than 600,000 boxes since it launched.</p>

      <p>The most affection ever given to a disposable cup was likely at the end of a beer-pong table. But, Benson Liu wondered, why couldn't the lowly drinking receptacle get a high-class makeover, something more akin to a wineglass? Having spent decades in food-container manufacturing, he took a year to figure it out. In addition to developing a new blow-molding process, Liu embraced 3-D printing, allowing customers to personalize glasses with a slew of printed designs. If Liu and his co-founder, Michael Fun, had the chance to do it over? "We'd raise more capital and go big!" says Liu. "We were a little conservative in the beginning. If we'd gone big sooner, we'd have 30 designs by now." Next up: the Reserve line--reusable and virtually indestructible--is slated to launch this fall. <i>--Kate Rockwood</i></p>

      <p>The idea for <a href="https://www.inc.com/profile/zolli-candy">Zolli Candy</a>'s sugar-free treats came about in 2012 when then 7-year-old Alina Morse was warned by her dad that the sugary lollipop offered to her at her parents' bank would rot her teeth. Alongside her parents, Morse then started developing recipes for sugar-free candy. The following year, her company was official and Morse became CEO. After starting with lollipops, the company now offers an array of goodies, including taffy and<b> </b>hard candies. The Commerce Township, Michigan-based company sells its products in major retailers such as Amazon, Kroger, Target, Walmart, Whole Foods, and Walgreens. It booked $2.2 million in 2018 sales. </p>

      <p>After graduating from college, Loren Brill learned she had Stage II Hodgkin lymphoma. "All my friends were headed off to jobs, and I was at home starting chemo," she says. Brill began tracking which foods helped her energy levels, and signed up for cooking classes to study nutrition and to take her mind off the treatments. "That's when I had this aha! moment, that I needed a healthier way to satisfy my sweet tooth." After more than a year of perfecting a chocolate chip cookie recipe, Brill began fielding requests for premixed dough for home baking. In 2011, she started <a href="https://www.inc.com/profile/sweet-lorens">Sweet Loren's</a> with $15,000 in personal savings, eventually landing a meeting with a Whole Foods buyer, despite not having any official manufacturing plans in place. Today, the gluten-free vegan brand--which also offers edible raw dough--is sold at 10,000 supermarkets nationwide. "At the end of the day," Brill says, "everyone loves cookies." <i>--Kate Rockwood </i></p>
