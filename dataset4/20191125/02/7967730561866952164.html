      <h1>Water consumption rises as south-east Queensland dam levels drop</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:05:39+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:05</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Stone</a></address>
      <p>Daily water consumption has soared in south-east Queensland despite the severe drought, prompting the early rollout of water conservation campaigns.</p>
      <p>Seqwater, which manages almost 90 per cent of south-east Queensland's water supply across 12 dams, reported that daily water consumption had topped 220 litres per person.</p>

      <p>That's more than 40 litres higher than the same time last year, when average water consumption per person was at 188 litres.</p>
      <p>The combined total of all of Seqwater's dams has fallen below 60 per cent, now sitting on 59.7 per cent, with Wivenhoe Dam at 47.8 per cent.</p>
      <p>Across the region, Gold Coast City Council consumers are using the most water per day, with 233 litres per person, closely followed by Redland City Council.</p>
      <p>In a joint statement on Sunday night, Premier Annastasia Palaszczuk and Natural Resources Minister Anthony Lynham urged residents to be careful with water consumption.</p>
      <p>It follows a survey from Seqwater that revealed 35 per cent of people didn't know how much water they had used.</p>
      <p>"We are reaching out to everyone in the south-east to ease back on their water usage with the 'every drop counts' campaign," Ms Palaszczuk said.</p>
      <p>"Two-thirds of our state is in drought and over the past few years we have seen below-average inflows into the 40 dams and reservoirs that make up the SEQ water grid."</p>
      <p>Of the 1400 people surveyed by Seqwater, 70 per cent said they were concerned about future water shortages and 90 per cent would adjust to water restrictions if necessary.</p>
      <p>Ms Palaszczuk said south-east Queenslanders "stepped up" during the Millennium Drought and reduced consumption to 120 litres per person per day.</p>
      <p>Dr Lynham said the state government was joining with Seqwater to promote its waterwise campaign earlier than would be typical in such drought circumstances, to ensure residents had the information needed.</p>
      <p>The "every drop counts" campaign will roll out on radio and social media in the days to come.</p>
