      <p>“She has already made a world record. Now she is striving for Guinness World Record. Sarah was excellent in problem-solving and aptitude questions. After realising this, we nurtured her and provided her with proper training. She can solve multiple kinds of cubes and not just one,” Charles told <i>ANI</i>.</p>
      <p>Originally called the ‘Magic Cube’, the Rubik’s cube is a 3-D twisty puzzle which was invented by Hungarian sculptor and professor Erno Rubik in 1974.</p>
      <p>Each of the six faces In a classic 3x3x3 Rubik’s Cube is covered by nine stickers, namely: white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow. The structure of the cubelets enables each face to turn independently, mixing up the colours and for the puzzle to be solved, each face must be returned to consisting of one colour.</p>
