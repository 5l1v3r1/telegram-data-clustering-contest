      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:40:37+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/author/leith/" target="_blank">Unconventional Economist</a></address>
      <p>Victorian Premier, Dan Andrews, was out and about over the weekend <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/daniel-andrews-eyes-private-investors-to-fund-suburban-rail-link-20191124-p53dkd.html">spruiking</a> his government’s 90 kilometre suburban rail loop, which he admitted is still yet to be costed and yet to be subject to a business case:</p>
      <blockquote>Mr Andrews said there had already been “thousands” of hours of technical planning over the past 12 months, including 14 bore holes dug up to test rock and soil for composition and stability…<br/><br/>The Age has previously reported it would be a $50 billion project, but Mr Andrews could not say exactly what the project would cost. The state has stumped up $300 million for the project’s business case.</blockquote>
