        <i>Profits declined last fiscal as <b><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ICICI-Prudential-Life-Insurance">ICICI Prudential Life Insurance</a> </b>shifted focus to the higher-margin protection business instead of the popular Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP). Earnings would rise in the years to come and profit margins will also soar, while the company also continues to commit to quality investments, <b><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/NS-Kannan">NS Kannan</a></b>, chief executive, told Shilpy Sinha and MC Govardhana Rangan in an interview. Edited excerpts:</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>It’s more than a year since you occupied the corner office. After a lull, insurers have become a favourite of investors. What has changed?<br/></b>The last one year has been both challenging and rewarding. The industry and the market have been volatile. We had to navigate those things. It was rewarding because we are starting to deliver what we said.</p>
      <p><b>What were the challenges? How did you navigate?</b> <br/>This is the brand that has grown over the years. It is a phase where we are getting from teenage to adolescence. The people, brand, and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/icici-bank-ltd/stocks/companyid-9194.cms">ICICI Bank</a> is a great partner. When I came back to this company, it was like coming home after four years. The company has become bigger, in distribution and in complexities. And as an organisation, we will have to keep growing. Today the product mix is much diversified. We have brought down ULIP to 69% from 85%. We have moving ahead in protection journey and it is now 15%. We have grown VNB (value of new business) at 20.2% for the first half. There is a huge under-penetration in protection and I see this as a multi-decade opportunity. The protection writing is only 2% and it has been operating only in savings.</p>
      <p><b>Insurance is supposed to provide funding for long-term infrastructure development. But regulatory investment rules appear to a roadblock. Is there a scope to relax them?<br/></b>They have stipulated minimum AA for investment in corporate bonds. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. For us in 19 years, we have zero NPA. In general we have been more overweight on government bonds as opposed to corporate bonds. We think that if interest rate has to be played, we can do it through government bonds, which is a liquid market than the one for corporate bonds. Within corporate, we have been underweight NBFCs. It really helped us. We will have to protect policyholders’ money.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ULIPs">ULIPs</a> have been popular both with buyers and insurers. Why are you shifting to protection?<br/></b>From adolescence, we are getting into adulthood. We want to take protection journey to the next level. We are 15% protection and with that we have been able to put a good VNB. There is a huge protection gap in the country. It is only 2% of the industry. It is nascent. Some studies like <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Swiss-Re">Swiss Re</a> have put the protection gap at $9 trillion. The awareness for protection goes up as the country’s per capita income goes up. Today, the per capita income is $2,000. ULIP will continue to be an important product in our portfolio. Today, the regulator has capped the charges. Demand compression is leading to a drop in ULIP portion.</p>
      <p><b>Insurance is not seen as the best way to invest unlike mutual funds. Nor does it have the convenience of bank deposits. How do you compete?<br/></b>Bank deposit is seen as safe, stable and liquid. There is some distinction between insurance and mutual funds. Insurance can give protection and goal-based savings. There will be asset allocation from customers. If you look at financial savings, 23% of household financial savings was going to life insurance. Customers are clear that for safety, liquidity they have to invest in insurance. Customers will have need for liquidity, yield and protection. In that spectrum, it is the asset allocation of customers.</p>
      <p><b>Annuity is a product that savers look forward to from insurance firms. You are doing only immediate annuity. Why?<br/></b>In the first six months, we have seen 100% growth in immediate annuity. There is pension opportunity going forward. We want to keep our asset and liability side pristine. In the 19 years, our NPA is zero, and no provisions have been made in our bond book. We want to keep the record going. Very high guaranteed product, which we cannot handle, we do not want in our portfolio. We do only manageable guarantee in the liability side.</p>
      <p><b>How do annuity products compete with the new pension scheme?<br/></b>There is some kind of double taxation on annuity. If after the accumulation phase, you go out and buy an annuity, the entire stream is charged, which comprises both principal and interest charge. The entire regime is charged. There is a case for a change. We have requested the regulator…There is some dichotomy in terms of expense structure.</p>
      <p><b>Digital is transforming financial services. What about insurance?<br/></b>I think in the foreseeable future, this industry will be intermediary driven. They are natural owners of customers who do business and transact with them. We look at partnerships in place - conventional and unconventional. In terms of conventional partnerships, we have tie-ups with 12 to 13 banks apart from ICICI Bank. In unconventional partnerships, we have tie-ups with over 300 companies, such as payments banks, small finance banks and wallets. In terms of Annual Premium Equivalent, 17 to 18% comes from unconventional partners.</p>

      <p><b>But banks continue to be predominant.<br/></b>We are a bank promoted company but we are not only bank dependent company. Today, all banks contribute 53% business. We have diversified distribution. We have invested in expanding agency. We have an agency base of 1.8 lakh. The agency channel underwent some bit of churn. We are a customer-centric organisation. The order of magnitude of margin for Ulips is 8-9%, traditional products would be 15% and protection is high.</p>
      <p><b>Why is ICICI Bank’s share in premium growth falling?<br/></b>ICICI Bank is still a dominant distributor of life insurance. We have our primary shareholder as distributor. They have been hovering around 50%. We have been rolling out products for their customers. We have rolled out PASA— pre-approved sum assured — for bank customers. We have launched term plans for people with pre-condition and out of protection net. It is doing well and has great potential.</p>
      <p><b>Your earnings fell 30% last year and remained flat this year. When will it turn positive?<br/></b>The accounting regime is such that upfront expenses are high and you cannot amortise the expense. In about 2 to 3 years, when IFRS comes in, there will be alignment of expenses. Last year, we declined by 30%. This year we have grown by 1%. From here on, we will see PAT stabilise. This year, we want to double the value of our new business. We want to grow the VNB by 22-25% a year. Margins have grown from 17% last year to 21% this year largely driven by protection from a product mix perspective.</p>
      <p><b>Persistency is a key issue when it comes to insurance. Does it affect assumptions for the VNB?<br/></b>Big-ticket Ulips have seen some drop in persistency. We have been able to grow 2% despite a 16% drop in Ulips in general. We have been able to pull back 50 basis points in persistency. Persistency is above the VNB assumption. VNB will be driven by premium growth, protection, productivity and persistency. It diversifies our protection mix. There are 6-7 companies active in protection. We have a 30% share in retail protection. Non-par is 15% of our product mix and the bulk of non-par is protection.</p>
