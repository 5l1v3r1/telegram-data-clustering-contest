      <p>Billie Eilish has had an OK week. On Wednesday, Eilish became the <a href="https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/billie-eilish-grammy-nominations/">youngest person</a> to ever be nominated in the Grammys' four major categories: Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best New Artist. Now, on Sunday, she took home the 2019 American Music Award for Favorite Alternative Rock Artist and crushed her very first AMA performance.</p>

      <p>After being introduced by Tyler, the Creator, Eilish took the stage with her Grammy-nominated brother, Finneas O'Connell, to perform "All the Good Girls Go to Hell" off her album <i>When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</i></p>

      <p>Not only did she perform on an actual burning set (did you catch the moment when Lizzo literally fanned herself in the audience?), she also made a clear statement about the climate crisis with her sparkly shirt that read: "No music on a dead planet." Whether the fire was a nod to our burning planet, hell, or both is open to your interpretation.</p>

      <p>After performing, Eilish then took home another award for <a href="https://twitter.com/AMAs/status/1198789658655645697?">New Artist of the Year</a>, and thanked "the fans because that’s the only reason I’m even alive." During her first acceptance speech of the night, Eilish was overwhelmed with emotion, saying, “I can’t believe I’m standing in front of—oh my god, I’m shaking. To be in this category, to even be mentioned in this category, is insane to me. I grew up being in love with all of you … The fact that you guys are all looking at me right now, that’s crazy. I cannot believe this."</p>
