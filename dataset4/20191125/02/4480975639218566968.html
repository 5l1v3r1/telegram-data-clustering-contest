      <h1>PBOC to inject more liquidity in December – China Press</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:53:57+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>The China Securities Journal carried an opinion piece on Wednesday, citing the Chinese analysts, as they predict the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) injecting more funds next month.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>“The PBOC is expected to inject more <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies">liquidity</a> into the financial system in December in an attempt to avoid the seasonal impact of earlier policy rate cuts.</p>
      <p>The PBOC could increase the medium-term lending facility (MLF), pledge supplementary lending (PSL), or even restart injecting 14 and 28-day reverse repos.</p>
      <p>These measures would be required because year-end financial supervision could increase the demand for funds.”</p>
