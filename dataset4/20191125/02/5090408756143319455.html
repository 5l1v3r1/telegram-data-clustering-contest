        <li>The singer-songwriter praised fan-voted awards in her acceptance speech, which many believe was a reaction to her recent <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/grammys-2020">Grammys</a> snub.</li>
        <li>The Grammys <a href="https://www.insider.com/2020-grammy-nominations-biggest-snubs-2019-11">failed to nominate Halsey for any awards</a>, despite “Without Me” being one of the biggest songs of the year.</li>
        <li>She recently <a href="https://www.insider.com/halsey-defends-bts-grammy-nominations-snubs-twitter-2019-11">said she was disappointed in the Grammys for failing to nominate BTS</a>, with whom she collaborated on “Boy With Luv.”</li>

      <p>Halsey may have subtly shaded the Grammys while onstage at the 2019 American Music Awards on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The singer-songwriter won favorite pop/rock song for “Without Me” and took the opportunity to praise the fan-voted awards ceremony.</p>
      <p>“When I was a kid I used to believe that this award was the ultimate validation,” she said during her acceptance speech. “But most of these awards really aren’t what they seem, at all.”</p>
      <p>“But that’s OK because I’m up here right now and I am so thankful to the AMAs, because they are the world’s largest fan-voted awards show,” she continued. “And I’m thankful to the fans, because they’re the people who really give a s— about music. And I’m thankful to the AMAs for giving those people a voice. You know, I’m gonna keep making music for them, and for us.”</p>

      <p>“Sometimes you grow up and the stuff that you believed in starts to lose its magic,” she concluded, “but music never does, because real fans, real artists, and real stories keep that magic alive.”</p>
      <p>While fans celebrated her powerful acceptance speech, many drew a connection to the recent announcement of the 2020 Grammys nominations.</p>
      <p>Halsey’s No. 1 single “Without Me” seemed like an easy choice for song of the year, and many even thought it would score a double nomination for song and record. Instead, <a href="https://www.insider.com/2020-grammy-nominations-biggest-snubs-2019-11">Halsey was completely excluded from the ceremony</a>.</p>

      <p>When the Grammy nominations were announced, <a href="https://twitter.com/halsey/status/1197195290186375168?s=20">Halsey soothed her fans on Twitter</a>, asking them not to “waste your anger or frustration.”</p>
      <p>“i see a lot of you are upset. of course im sad too. none of it matters. literally none of it. you’re here. im here. + everything is gonna stay exactly the same and without me is still a super tight, record breaking song,” she wrote.</p>
      <p>She also expressed disappointment that BTS, with whom she collaborated on the smash hit “Boy With Luv,” <a href="https://www.insider.com/halsey-defends-bts-grammy-nominations-snubs-twitter-2019-11">didn’t receive a single nomination</a>.</p>
      <p>“BTS deserved many nominations,” she wrote. “I am however, unsurprised that they weren’t acknowledged. the US is so far behind on the whole movement. the time will come.”</p>
      <p>BTS fans were thrilled with her acceptance speech, which many interpreted as an extension of that tweet.</p>
