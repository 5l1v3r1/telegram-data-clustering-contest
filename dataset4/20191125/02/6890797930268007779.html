      <h1>Melbourne property gets “rattled”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:20:13+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/author/david/" target="_blank">Houses and Holes</a></address>
      <p>So says the <a href="https://www.afr.com/property/residential/melbourne-s-top-end-goes-from-boom-to-bomb-20191122-p53d2c">AFR</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Property experts say Melbourne property prices could be stalling after four multimillion-dollar properties failed to attract a bid in the past week.<br/><br/>Middle markets in Sydney and Melbourne, where properties range from between $1 million and $3 million, continue to be pushed along by investors, first home buyers and downsizers, particularly around inner-city postcodes.<br/><br/>But an increase in the number of sellers in Melbourne, attracted by rising prices and high clearance rates, is increasing competition and “rattling a few sale campaigns, which are not going to plan,” says Cate Bakos, a buyers’ agent.<br/><br/>…buyer fears about poor construction, oversupply and flammable materials continue to hold back demand, according to market specialists.</blockquote>
      <p>Characteristic of a very thin and vulnerable market. That said, there is little evidence of any material slowing in Melbourne yet:</p>

      <p>I do expect the market to ease next year as the economy refuses to bounce, in part thanks to consumer doubts about apartments.</p>
      <p>And a goodly external shock would test it, with unhappy results I’d wager.</p>
