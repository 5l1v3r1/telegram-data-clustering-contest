      <p>Kelsea, 26, looked drop-dead-gorgeous when she rocked a red and silver sequin suit with high-waisted, fitted straight-leg trousers and a matching blazer. The sparkly striped suit hugged her petite frame perfectly and she chose to wear nothing underneath, not even a bra, revealing her bare chest and super tiny waist. She topped her look off with a pair of metallic silver pointed pumps.</p>
