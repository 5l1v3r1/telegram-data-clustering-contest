      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 25): The FBM KLCI remained below the 1,600-point level at mid-morning today, weighed by select blue chips.</p>
      <p>At 10am, the FBM KLCI fell 2.84 points to 1,594.</p>
      <p>Losers led gainers by 302 to 241, while 307 counters traded unchanged. Volume was 775.35 million shares valued at RM306.42 million.</p>
      <p>The decliners included Heineken Malaysia Bhd, Berjaya Corp Bhd, Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd and Malaysia-listed Hang Seng Index-linked put warrants.</p>
      <p>The actives included Eduspec Holdings Bhd, Bumi Armada Bhd, Ekovest Bhd, EA Holdings Bhd, Sapura Energy Bhd and DGB Asia Bhd.</p>
      <p>The gainers included Chin Teck Plantations Bhd, Master-Pack Group Bhd, British American Tobacco (M) Bhd, United Plantations Bhd, MBM Resources Bhd, IGB Bhd and MISC Bhd.</p>
      <p>Asian shares made guarded gains on Monday as investors braced for another week of likely conflicting commentary on the Sino-US trade dispute, while the outperformance of recent US economic data gave the US dollar a leg up on its peers, according to <i>Reuters</i>.</p>
      <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan bounced 0.26%, after losing 0.4% last week, it said.</p>
      <p>HLIB Research said that in the US, market participants certainly are waiting for the results of a phase one mini trade deal. If trade negotiators cannot come to an agreement before Dec 15, a new set of tariffs may kick in in mid-December.</p>
      <p>"This may put pressure on the Dow, limiting the upside potential on the Dow (which is having stiff resistance along 28,000-28,200 for the time being.</p>
      <p>"With the positive tone on Wall Street and statements from President Trump, we believe buying interest may emerge on the local front.</p>
      <p>"In addition, the crude palm oil prices may sustain the trading interest amongst plantation heavyweights, contributing towards further rebound in FBM KLCI. Trading range of the KLCI will be located around 1,580-1,620," it said.</p>
