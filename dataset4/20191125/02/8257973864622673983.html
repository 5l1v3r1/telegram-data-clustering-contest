      <p>Nov. 24 (UPI) -- Devlin "Duck" Hodges replaced struggling quarterback <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Mason-Rudolph/?tps=1">Mason Rudolph</a> and guided the injury-plagued <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Pittsburgh_Steelers/?tps=1">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> to a 16-10 win over the winless <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Cincinnati-Bengals/?tps=1">Cincinnati Bengals</a> on Sunday at <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Paul_Brown/?tps=1">Paul Brown</a> Stadium.</p>
      <p>Hodges took over for Rudolph, who tossed four interceptions in the Steelers' Week 11 loss to the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Cleveland-Browns/?tps=1">Cleveland Browns</a>, early in the second half and threw a 79-yard touchdown pass to receiver James Washington on his third play under center.</p>
      <p>Hodges then helped lead the Steelers (6-5) on two more scoring drives, leaving Pittsburgh with a quarterback decision as the season continues without injured starter <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Ben_Roethlisberger/?tps=1">Ben Roethlisberger</a>. Hodges previously filled in for one game after Rudolph sustained a concussion. <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Mike_Tomlin/?tps=1">Mike Tomlin</a> switched back to Rudolph when he was healthy.</p>
      <p>The Steelers grabbed a 3-0 lead late in the second quarter after a 26-yard field goal by <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Chris-Boswell/?tps=1">Chris Boswell</a>. Cincinnati (0-11) got on the board shortly later when Ryan Finley connected with <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Tyler-Boyd/?tps=1">Tyler Boyd</a> for a 15-yard score before halftime.</p>
      <p>Pittsburgh regained the lead when Washington's long score made it 10-7. Bengals kicker Randy Bullock's 27-yard boot tied the score 10-10 with 5:07 left in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Boswell added a 47-yard kick and a 26-yard field goal to give the Steelers a 16-10 lead late in the fourth quarter. Pittsburgh's defense preserved its advantage when Bud Dupree sacked Finley and forced a fumble that he recovered with 2:38 remaining to seal the win.</p>
      <p>Rudolph was 8-for-16 with 85 yards and one interception before being replaced. Hodges completed 5-of-11 passes for 118 yards and one score.</p>
      <p>Benny Snell filled in for the injured <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/James-Conner/?tps=1">James Conner</a> and recorded 21 carries for 98 yards. Washington led the team in catches (three) and receiving yards (98).</p>
      <p>Finley was 12-of-26 for 192 yards and one touchdown. Boyd notched five catches for 101 yards and one score, and running back <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Joe-Mixon/?tps=1">Joe Mixon</a> tallied 79 rushing yards on 18 carries.</p>
      <p>The Steelers will host the Cleveland Browns next Sunday. Cincinnati will play the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/New-York-Jets/?tps=1">New York Jets</a>.</p>
