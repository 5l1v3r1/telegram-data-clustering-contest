      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 25): Shares in Uchi Technologies Bhd rose 2.14% at mid-morning today following a positive technical outlook on the stock.</p>
      <p>At 10am, Uchi gained 6 sen to RM2.86 for a market capitalisation of RM1.29 billion.</p>
      <p>CGS-CIMB Research has maintained its "Add" rating on Uchi at RM2.80 with a higher target price (TP) of RM3.30 (from RM3.06) and said Uchi's 9M19 core net profit beat expectations at 77% of house FY19F and 76% of <i>Bloomberg </i>consensus due to better-than-expected earnings in 3Q19.</p>
      <p>In a note Nov 22, the research house said Uchi's 3Q19 net profit surged 33% year-on-year (y-o-y), driven by robust demand from its Art-of-Living (AL) and biotech segments, while 9M19 net profit also rose by 16% y-o-y.</p>
      <p>"We raise our FY19-21F net profit forecasts by 4-6% to reflect the higher sales projection driven by resilient demand from AL and biotech segments.</p>
      <p>"We maintain our Add rating with a higher RM3.30 TP, based on 17x FY21F P/E as we roll over our valuation to end-2020," it said.</p>
