      <h1>Realme X50 will be Realme’s first smartphone with 5G</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:46:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/pranobmehrotra/" target="_blank">Pranob Mehrotra</a></address>
      <p>Following the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/realme-x2-pro-snapdragon-855-plus-50w-fast-charging-64mp-camera-india-launch/">recent launch</a> of its first true flagship — the Realme X2 Pro — Chinese smartphone manufacturer Realme is prepping up to launch its first 5G enabled handset. As per a recent teaser shared by the company’s Chief Marketing Officer, Xu Qi Chase, the upcoming device will be called the Realme X50. The teaser image shared on Weibo further reveals that the Realme X50 will offer support for dual-mode 5G, which means that the device will support both 5G Standalone (SA) and Non-Standalone (NSA) networks, just like the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-redmi-k30-5g-dual-punch-hole-front-cameras/">upcoming Redmi K30</a> 5G. However, it isn’t clear whether the Realme X50 will make use of a MediaTek SoC or a Qualcomm SoC to offer 5G support.</p>
      <p>The image also gives us our first glimpse at the device, highlighting its pill-shaped punch-hole display which will house dual selfie cameras. This is another feature that the device shares with the Redmi K30, which will also feature a punch-hole display with a similar design. However, the cutout on the Redmi K30 is on the opposite end of the display. It’s worth noting that back in September this year, Realme released a statement confirming an upcoming 5G smartphone based on the Snapdragon 7 series, so the Realme X50 could feature a Snapdragon 7 series chip. While we don’t have any further information on the specifications or release timeline for the device, Realme India’s CEO Madhav Sheth has <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-redmi-k30-5g-dual-punch-hole-front-cameras/">previously confirmed</a> that the company will launch its first 5G device this year. This, along with the recent teaser, leads us to believe that the Realme X50 might be launched in China in the next few weeks.</p>
