      <p>NO fewer than 24 people died yesterday after a passenger plane crashed into houses in Goma city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, local officials said.</p>
      <p>Residents on the ground, including four family members, were among the victims.</p>
      <p>The small aircraft went down in the Mapendo neighbourhood after “missing” its take-off from the city’s airport yesterday morning, North Kivu Regional Governor Nzanzu Kasivita said.</p>
      <p>The officials said 17 passengers and two crew members were on board the plane.</p>
      <p>Air accidents are relatively frequent in DR Congo amid lax safety standards and poor maintenance, and all the country’s commercial carriers are banned from operating in the European Union.</p>
      <p>The Dornier-228 twin-turboprop aircraft – owned by private carrier Busy Bee – crashed about a minute after take-off, a source at Goma airport told the BBC.</p>
      <p>The plane had been scheduled to fly to Beni, 350km (220 miles) north of the country.</p>

      <p>The cause of the crash is still unclear, but some sources said the plane experienced engine failure right after take-off.</p>
      <p>Rescue workers and local residents rushed to the crash site to evacuate the injured and also retrieve the bodies.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately known how many residents were in their homes when the plane crashed.</p>
      <p>Kasivita confirmed the crash had “cost the lives of our fellow countrymen” and offered his condolences to the families of survivors.</p>
      <p>The BBC has contacted Busy Bee for comment.</p>
