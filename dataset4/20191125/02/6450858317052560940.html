      <h1>OnePlus reveals customer data breach of names, emails and addresses</h1>
      <h2>Not the first time the company has fallen foul of an attack</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:22:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:22</time> by <a rel="author">Henry Burrell</a></address>
      <p>OnePlus has been hit by a data breach that has leaked customers’ names, email addresses, contact numbers and postal addresses. The company says that payment information, passwords and OnePlus account information was not stolen.</p>
      <p>Not everyone with a OnePlus order account has been affected. In an <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=10937&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3778548-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fuk%2Fsupport%2Ffaq22119102">online FAQ post</a>, OnePlus said that only “certain orders” have been breached, but declined to say how many or within what period of time.</p>
      <p>Affected customers were informed by email prior to OnePlus posting on its website. The company claims that because the information taken is not to do with payments, the extent of the consequences will be phishing and scam emails.</p>
      <p>We’d imagine if you’ve bought a recent OnePlus 7T or 7T Pro you’ll have been affected – check your inbox.</p>
      <p>It’s not a great look for OnePlus, with this its third data breach in two years following <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3778548-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fmobile-phone%2Foneplus-reveals-customer-data-breach-of-names-emails-addresses-3778548%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fforums.oneplus.com%2Fthreads%2Fjan-19-update-an-update-on-credit-card-security.752415%2F">credit card information gathered by hackers</a> around the time of the OnePlus 5T launch and the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3778548-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fmobile-phone%2Foneplus-reveals-customer-data-breach-of-names-emails-addresses-3778548%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidpolice.com%2F2019%2F06%2F14%2Foneplus-accidentally-leaked-email-addresses-from-its-shot-on-oneplus-app%2F">harvesting of emails</a> possible in its Shot On OnePlus feature. </p>
      <p>OnePlus claims it is “partnering with a world-renowned security platform next month”, which seems like a year too late to us. Its post also doesn’t suggest anything users can do to their accounts as passwords do not appear to have been stolen. We’d advise changing them anyway.</p>
