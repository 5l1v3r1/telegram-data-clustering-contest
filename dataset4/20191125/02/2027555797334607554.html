      <h1>LVMH close to buying US' Tiffany for $16.3 bn: Sources</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:42:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/reuters" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>French luxury group LVMH is nearing a deal to buy U.S. jewellery chain Tiffany &amp; Co for about $16.3 billion, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday. Bulgari owner LVMH is nearing a deal to acquire Tiffany for $135 per share, the sources said, adding that a deal could be announced either on Sunday or Monday.</p>
      <p>Reuters reported this week that LVMH had persuaded Tiffany to provide it with confidential due diligence after it raised its bid to close to $16 billion.</p>
      <p>Tiffany earlier this month rebuffed LVMH's initial $120-per-share all-cash offer, arguing it significantly undervalued the company.</p>
      <p>Tiffany, founded in New York in 1837 and featured in the 1961 movie "Breakfast at Tiffany's" starring Audrey Hepburn, had struggled with falling annual sales and profit since 2015, before a revenue turnaround in 2017.</p>
      <p>Jewellery was one of the strongest performing areas of the luxury industry in 2018, according to consultancy Bain &amp; Co, which forecast that comparable sales in the $20 billion global market were set to grow 7% this year.</p>
      <p>Under Chief Executive Alessandro Bogliolo, former head of fashion firm Diesel and a Bulgari alumnus, Tiffany has been building up its e-commerce business and is trying to court younger shoppers with more affordable pendants, earrings and new designs.</p>
      <p>The news was first reported by the Financial Times. Both companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
