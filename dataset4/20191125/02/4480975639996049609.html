      <p>Economists at Standard Chartered are out with their report on China’s capital outflows for the month of October.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>“Our tracker shows only a marginal increase in non-FDI capital outflows in October as CNY strengthened.</p>
      <p>Merchandise trade surplus widened as decline in exports eased; FDI and ODI largely evened out.</p>
      <p>Overall cross-border flows stayed balanced; SAFE data indicates increasing incentive to keep FX.</p>
      <p>Trade deal optimism likely limited rise in capital outflows.”</p>
