      <p>They were cutting more than nails at this establishment.</p>
      <p>A woman enjoying a manicure at a North Carolina nail salon witnessed an unusual sight — workers chopping up deer meat in plain sight.</p>
      <p>Morgan Taylor posted about her bizarre experience on Facebook last Thursday, including a photo of a salon worker at Diamond Nails in High Point, NC, kneeling on the floor while cutting hunks of meat.</p>
      <p>“Hunting for a new nail salon in High Point, North Carolina? Talk about multitaskers … manicures, pedicures, and amateur deer butchers. Oh deer!” Taylor wrote, along with the hashtags “notfawned” and “ohbuckno.”</p>
      <p>Taylor <a href="https://www.kcci.com/article/high-point-diamond-nails-salon-deer-butchering/29930714">told WXII-TV</a> she was at the salon last Wednesday getting her nails done for her sister’s Saturday wedding when the butchering occurred.</p>
      <p>“I was sitting there getting my nails done, and looked over and they were pulling out deer meat from a cooler,” Taylor told the outlet.</p>
      <p>“I get scared that I’m going to see trash on the ground or weird smells, but not to see a dead deer.”</p>
      <p>Taylor said the workers placed the meat atop a tarp on the floor and sliced it without gloves. Others in the salon, including customers, seemed unfazed by the sight, she said.</p>
      <p>“All the workers there were really nice to me and they did a good job, but I don’t think they thought that anyone would care,” said Taylor.</p>
      <p>“And they didn’t think it was wrong to cut it in front of clients in the nail salon, which is surprising.”</p>
      <p>The incident was reported by Taylor to the North Carolina Board of Cosmetic Arts. They are investigating whether the nail salon violated any codes, the report said.</p>
      <p>The owners of the salon had no comment on the occurrence, a woman inside the salon told WXII-TV.</p>
