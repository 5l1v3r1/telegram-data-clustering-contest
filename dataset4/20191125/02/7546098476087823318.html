      <h1>Should you buy Fortescue shares in 2020?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:05:13+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/kennethhallau/" target="_blank">Kenneth Hall</a></address>
      <p><b>Fortescue Metals Group Limited </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Fortescue+Metals+Group+Limited/?ticker=ASX-FMG">(ASX: FMG)</a> shares have been rocketing higher in 2019.</p>
      <p>The company’s shares are up 134.46% so far this year on the back of strong commodity prices and earnings.</p>
      <p>But is there still time to buy or should you look elsewhere for value on the ASX in 2020?</p>
      <h3>Why Fortescue shares are surging higher in 2019</h3>
      <p>Despite the strong capital gains this year, it hasn’t been all smooth sailing for Fortescue shareholders.</p>
      <p>The company’s shares have been under pressure in periods of 2019 largely due to fluctuating gold prices and the US–China trade war.</p>
      <p>Despite these challenges, Fortescue shares have more than doubled on the back of earnings outperformance in FY 2019.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/08/26/fortescue-metals-posts-195-increase-in-profit-to-us3-2-billion/">Fortescue’s revenues rocketed 45% to US$9.96 billion</a> while underlying EBITDA surged 90% to US$6 billion.</p>
      <p>The real kicker? Fortescue’s net profit after tax (NPAT) rocketed an astonishing 263% to US$3.19 billion.</p>
      <h3>Should you buy in 2020?</h3>
      <p>There’s no doubt Fortescue has been a top performer on the ASX 200 in 2019. But past performance doesn’t indicate future success and here’s where I would be wary.</p>
      <p>Fortescue shares are currently trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 6.41x earnings, which makes it one of the better value ASX mining stocks on the market.</p>
      <p>For comparison, <b>BHP Group Ltd </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-BHP/">(ASX: BHP)</a> and <b>Rio Tinto Limited </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Rio+Tinto+Limited/?ticker=ASX-RIO">(ASX: RIO)</a> shares trade at 15.3x and 8.1x, respectively.</p>
      <p>Despite Fortescue’s strong capital gains in 2019, I think the exposure to commodity prices makes the stock a risky one in 2020.</p>
      <p>However, if you’re looking for commodities exposure in your portfolio then Fortescue shares could be a great option.</p>
      <h3>What are some ASX alternatives?</h3>
      <p>I personally like some of the countercyclical stocks on the market right now which could be better value than Fortescue shares.</p>
      <p>I’d be keeping an eye on <b>CSL Limited </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/CSL+Limited/?ticker=ASX-CSL">(ASX: CSL)</a> and <b>Origin Energy Ltd </b>(ASX: ORG) ahead of the February results season.</p>
      <p>These stocks could provide strong dividends and robust earnings in the face of a changing business cycle in 2020.</p>
