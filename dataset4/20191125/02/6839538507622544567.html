      <p>A victim who survived being shot in the stomach three times at home in Hallam now fears for his life, as police hunt for a champagne-coloured luxury car possibly linked to the violent attack.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order">Police</a> believe the October 6 shooting was targeted but the victim has been unable to shed any light as to why he was hit.</p>
      <p>Armed Crime detectives have been told a group of men attended a Nettle Drive home in Hallam about 6.10pm and demanded entry to the property.</p>
      <p>An altercation took place between the group and the 54-year-old victim and his 34-year-old female partner.</p>
      <p>The Dandenong man was seriously injured after he was shot in the stomach at least three times and was rushed to hospital by his partner.</p>
      <p>Detective Superintendent Peter Brigham said the victim had sustained “quite serious injuries” and he had “narrowly avoided being killed”.</p>
      <p>“A number of shots were fired at the address,” Det Supt Brigham said. “We believe this was a targeted attack. He has concerns for his safety.</p>
      <p>“We are very concerned about this, it has happened on a Sunday evening at 6pm.</p>
      <p>“We have a large team of detectives investigating this matter.”</p>
      <p>Police said they were unsure what the altercation was about, but the victim was co-operating with police.</p>
      <p>The victim is said to be unsure of the specifics as to why he was shot.</p>
      <p>“He has had extensive surgery, he will probably have ongoing health issues as a consequence of the injuries,” Det Supt Brigham said.</p>
      <p>The car is not believed to be stolen.</p>
      <p>Police said they hadn’t identified any links to outlawed motorcycle gangs in their investigation but were unable to eliminate that possibility.</p>
      <p>CCTV from the area has led investigators to believe a champagne-coloured BMW sedan may be linked to the shooting.</p>
      <p>The car has distinctive Euro-style V number plates and is likely to be a 2004 to 2007 model.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information about the BMW including its owner and current whereabouts is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.</p>
