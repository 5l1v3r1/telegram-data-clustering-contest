      <p>MUMBAI: <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/NCP">NCP</a> on Sunday made renewed attempts to convince Ajit Pawar to resign as deputy CM. Senior NCP leaders Jayant Patil and Dilip Walse Patil met Ajit on Sunday urging him to resign from the BJP-led government and obey the instructions of ‘Pawar saheb’.</p>
      <p>However, Ajit told them that there was no question of resigning and the party should fall in line and support <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/BJP">BJP</a> to avoid a split, EThas learnt. Ajit also told them that though MLAs were ‘holed up’ with Sharad Pawar, they will switch sides during the trust vote.</p>
      <p>Ahead of his meeting with Ajit Pawar, Jayant said: “Almost all our MLAs are with us, only Ajit has left. We are trying to convince him.”</p>
      <p>Soon after the meeting, Ajit Pawar tweeted: “I am in NCP and shall always be in NCP and Sharad Pawar is our leader. Our BJP-NCP alliance shall provide a stable government in Maharashtra for the next five years.”</p>

      <p>Ajit Pawar further tweeted: “There is absolutely no need to worry, all is well. However, a little patience is required.”</p>

      <p>Ajit Pawar’s tweet created confusion among NCP MLAs and cadre. However, Sharad Pawar tweeted back: “There is no question of forming an alliance with BJP, and NCP has unanimously decided to ally with <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Shiv-Sena">Shiv Sena</a> and Congress to form the government.</p>
      <p>Shri Ajit Pawar’s statement is false and misleading...” NCP leaders had approached Ajit Pawar on Saturday too but were rebuffed. Jayant told Ajit that he shouldn’t be ‘adamant and see reason’, party sources said.</p>

      <p>Sharad Pawar’s daughter and Ajit’s cousin Supriya Sule too has ‘sent feelers’ to Ajit urging him to return, so did Rohit Pawar, who in an emotional Facebook post in Marathi said: “I have seen Pawar saheb (Sharad Pawar) taking care of the entire family. I have seen him supporting Ajit dada (brother) when his father (Anantrao) passed away. Saheb has always loved Ajit like his son. Ajit too feels the same way… Ajit Dada should agree to saheb’s decision and return home. Pawar saheb never mixes politics with family.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, BJP leaders said Sharad Pawar should back his nephew Ajit to avoid a split in the family and the party. BJP believes that the NCP leadership may come around and that’s the reason why Sharad Pawar hasn’t expelled Ajit from the party. However, those close to Sharad Pawar said he has taken Ajit’s revolt personally.</p>
      <p>NCP is also waiting for SC verdict. The party is thinking of suspending or expelling Ajit if NCP’s efforts to win him over fail. BJP claimed Ajit’s sacking as the NCP legislative party leader is illegal.</p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar had sought legal opinion on his sacking on Saturday itself, BJP sources said. Ajit and those close to him said he continued to be part of NCP and would issue whip on the day of voting.</p>
      <p>NCP has info r med the Maharashtra governor’s office through a letter that Ajit was no longer its legislative party head. “NCP’s resolution passed yesterday claimed that Jayant Patil has the powers of the legislative party head. Either you appoint him as the legislative party head or not. How can he (Jayant Patil) have the powers without being appointed as such,”asked a BJP leader.</p>
