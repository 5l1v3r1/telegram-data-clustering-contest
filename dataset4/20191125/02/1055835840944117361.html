      <p>Sara Leonardi-McGrath knew she was lucky. “I have an amazing husband, two stepchildren who are healthy and make me the envy of everyone because of how much they adore me, and a beautiful, strong-willed little daughter who is just so funny,” she tells <i>Stellar.</i> “Even my parents are healthy and alive.” </p>
      <p>Yet for all her good fortune, the wife of former Australian cricketer Glenn McGrath felt terrible. She had developed anxiety and was having what she now sees was a disproportionate reaction to unfortunate incidents and irritations in her life.</p>
      <p>She’d lost her cool on the phone with the police while trying to deal with construction vehicles parked dangerously in her street and had fallen into a heap after accidentally running over the family cat.</p>

      <p>“I was beside myself and was screaming at the top of my lungs – I even threw up,” she says, recalling the day in January this year when all the stress and unhappiness she was feeling was coming to a head. </p>
      <p>“I felt like the world was going to close in on me, like I was suffocating, but like I was also going to explode.”</p>
      <p>After breaking down in tears in front of her mum, Leonardi-McGrath realised she needed help. She saw her doctor and after a long discussion, she realised she had developed anxiety, had probably suffered post-natal depression, and was feeling that her only purpose in life was to fulfil the needs of others. </p>
      <p>Like a lot of mums of newborns, she’d had to adjust to a new role, but she also now realises the pre-eclampsia she suffered late in her pregnancy along with her daughter’s premature birth had taken their toll.</p>

      <p>“My blood pressure was 200 over 150 and I could’ve died,” she recalls.</p>
      <p>While she didn’t struggle when Madison, now four, was a baby, Leonardi-McGrath realises that it was the toddler years that proved challenging.</p>
      <p>She was exercising ferociously – doing up to eight classes a week – trying to reclaim her health and fitness and was guiding her stepchildren, James, now 19, and Holly, 18, through their last years of school.</p>

      <p>As she says: “I felt like I was a machine for everyone else. I give 100 per cent to everything, but I realised I needed to do something for myself.”</p>
      <p>While she accepted her anxiety was due to a chemical imbalance in the brain, Leonardi-McGrath knew external factors were impacting on her happiness.</p>
      <p>Worse, despite 10 fun-filled and loving years with Glenn, three healthy children and a “can do” personality, she felt guilty about not coping. And as she knew only all too well through the family’s work with the McGrath Foundation, there were many people far worse off than her.</p>
      <p>Fortunately Leonardi-McGrath, who was raised in the US and Italy, took the same bold approach to getting better as she did to her decision to move to Australia with Glenn just months after they met in 2009.</p>

      <p>On her doctor’s advice she cut down her exercise, talked about how she was feeling with a professional and focused on “manifesting” and prayer to help her find a purpose. She also took magnesium, which she says made her feel calmer.</p>
      <p>Then one day, as Holly was baking in the kitchen, Leonardi-McGrath, now 37, took out a tie-dye kit she had bought at Spotlight. As a long-time fashion enthusiast, she’d noted the tie-dye trend was featuring in designer collections, including Prada, and as she transformed a pile of white T-shirts into glorious swirls of colour, she felt the most content she had been in a long time. Even Glenn, who had tried to support her in any way he could, remarked: “You look really happy right now.”</p>
      <p>Ten T-shirts quickly became 30 and friends began asking if they could buy them. So Leonardi-McGrath began to diversify, working with silk and linen and moving on to ice-dyeing, which results in a beautiful watercolour effect.</p>
      <p>Using social media and a website to showcase her designs, Leonardi-McGrath decided to begin a business, even though everyone was telling her tie-dyeing was a fad.</p>

      <p>“Pretty much everything but Chanel shoes are a fad,” she says with a laugh, explaining that It’s A Fad seemed like the perfect name for her new business.</p>
      <p>Since then she has broadened to producing more designs, including kaftans and leather pants in shades of silver and gold. And having seen how women support each other through the McGrath Foundation, she’s now hired other women, including a pattern maker, embroiderer and manufacturers, in both India and Australia.</p>
      <p>As the year closes, Leonardi-McGrath admits she’s in a far better space than when it started. Sparkle the cat recovered from being run over but recently died of old age, and James and Holly have now finished school.</p>
      <p>“They’re such good kids – I’m so proud of both of them,” she says. “My family is my life.”</p>
      <p>That being so, she relishes working in her overalls from her studio at home and feeling as if she, once again, has a purpose of her own. “Glenn is happy that I’m happy,” she says, laughing. “As he says, ‘Happy wife, happy life.’”</p>
