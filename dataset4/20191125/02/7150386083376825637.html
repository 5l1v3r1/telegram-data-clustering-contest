The promo shared by <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/ekta-kapoor/">Ekta Kapoor</a> on her social media handles shows a dramatic baseline of the story.

He then follows the snake to an old temple where he finds it getting converted into a human figure and there arrives the <i>Naagin</i> of the show – Jasmine Bhasin.</p>
