      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:07:16+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:07</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p>Taylor Swift lashed out at ex manager Scooter Braun in a victorious AMA speech after making music history in a night to remember.</p>
      <p>Her victorious sweep made her the most celebrated AMA star ever, second only to King of Pop Michael Jackson.</p>
      <p>Pop princess Taylor took the chance to praise Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group, amid a bitter row with the company she spent the majority of her career with.</p>
      <p>Speaking after collecting Artist of the Year Taylor said: "I really don’t have anything articulate to say. Just the fact that the last year of my life has had some of the most amazing times, and also some of just the hardest things I’ve gone through in my life and not a lot of them are things that haven’t been public."</p>
      <p>Taylor accused her former label manager and a prominent music industry figure of "exercising tyrannical control" over her music.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old Shake It Off singer had taken aim at Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta in a social media rant as her feud with them reached new heights.</p>
