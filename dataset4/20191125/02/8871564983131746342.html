      <h1>Ho Down: Crowds celebrate pro-Beijing firebrand’s loss, as establishment candidates falter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:24:22+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Hong%20Kong" target="_blank">Coconuts Hong Kong</a></address>
      <p>In scenes reminiscent of the end of <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, jubilant Hongkongers gathered in Tuen Mun last night to cheer the loss of <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/uk-university-strips-junius-ho-of-honorary-law-doctorate/">renowned non-doctor</a> and pro-Beijing firebrand Junius Ho in yesterday’s district council elections, which saw <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/pro-dems-win-in-apparent-landslide-at-hong-kong-district-council-elections/">pro-dems make astonishing gains</a>.</p>
      <p>Junius Ho was defeated in his bid to be re-elected to the Lok Tsui constituency of the Yuen Long district council by the Democratic Party’s Lo Chun-yu by more than 1,200 votes.</p>
      <p>Lo garnered 3,474 votes to Ho’s 2,278.</p>

      <p>After news of Ho’s defeat spread, a crowd of people began to cheer.</p>
      <p>Some popped bottles of champagne in celebration while others made do with bottles of beer.</p>

      <p>Others even started chanting “Ho’s finished,” which in Cantonese is pronounced “Ho <i>yi yuen</i>” — a stinging homophone for “councillor Ho.”</p>

      <p>Ho is arguably the most reviled figure in the eyes of the city’s pro-democracy protesters, with the possible exception of Chief Executive Carrie Lam herself.</p>
      <p>Long known for gleefully courting controversy, Ho’s already substantial infamy skyrocketed after he was filmed <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/junius-ho-got-chummy-with-yuen-long-assailants-calls-their-values-heroic-in-presser/">glad-handing men believed to have taken part in the July 21 mob attack</a> on protesters, journalists, and commuters at Yuen Long MTR station.</p>
      <p>The vitriol directed at Ho, however, took a turn for the physical when he <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/breaking-pro-beijing-firebrand-junius-ho-stabbed-while-canvassing-in-tuen-mun/">stabbed while canvassing in Tuen Mun earlier this month</a>. The assailant was quickly subdued, and Ho wasn’t badly injured in the attack, and only required stitches. The suspect has been <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/junius-ho-stabbing-suspect-charged-with-attempted-murder/">charged with attempted murder</a>, and due to have his case heard in court on Feb. 3.</p>
      <p>Despite his loss in the district elections, Ho remains a lawmaker.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, with returns appearing to overwhelmingly favor pro-dems, Ho was not the only high-profile candidate on the pro-Beijing side to suffer a stunning defeat.</p>
      <p>Michael Tien, a moderate voice within the pro-Beijing camp, also lost his seat on Tsuen Wan district council. Reacting to news of his defeat, Tien said he “respect[ed] the electorate’s decision,” the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3039132/results-blog"><i>SCMP</i> reports</a>, adding that the vote showed “young people are no longer insensitive to politics,” and that the government should listen to youths’ concerns.</p>
      <p>Alice Mak, of the Federation of Trade Unions, was also among the pro-Beijing losers, and was quick to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RTHKVNEWS/videos/1022557351424955/">blame pro-establishmentarians’ heavy losses on Chief Executive Carrie Lam </a>.</p>
      <p>“The government’s poor governance has given rise to many public grievances,” she said in a press conference. “In the election campaign, pro-government candidates have been unfairly treated. This is a very important reason.”</p>
      <p>Holden Chow, a lawmaker from the biggest pro-Beijing party, the DAB, also lost his district council seat on the Islands district council.</p>
      <p>Chow was one of the lawmakers to hold a “district councillor super seat,” a functional constituency made up of lawmakers who are also district councillors. Chow losing his district council seat means he cannot run for re-election as a lawmaker via the super seat. If he wants to run in the upcoming Legislative Council elections in 2020, he will have to do so the hard way, through a geographical constituency.</p>
      <p>Prominent pro-dems to win, meanwhile, included lawmaker Roy Kwong; Kelvin Lam, who ran as a stand-in following the <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/breaking-pro-democracy-activist-joshua-wong-barred-from-upcoming-local-elections/">disqualification of pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong</a>; and Andrew Chiu, who <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/pro-democracy-politician-with-ear-bitten-off-among-6-wounded-as-bloody-brawl-caps-day-of-hong-kong-mall-chaos/">had his ear bitten off</a> during an attack on pro-democracy protesters in Tai Koo Shing.</p>
      <p>Prominent pro-dem figure and former lawmaker Leung “Long Hair” Kwok-hung, however, wasn’t so lucky. DAB Chairwoman Starry Lee managed fend off Leung’s challenge in the Kowloon City district council.</p>
