      <ul>
        <li>In HBO's Watchmens sixth episode, we return to 1938 and Hooded Justices origins.</li>
        <li>A cop in New York, Hooded Justice/Will Reeves stumbles onto a conspiracy involving the Ku Klux Klan, repeating the phrase "Beware the Cyclops."</li>
        <li>This is the history of Klan involvement in New Yorks police departments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a27494112/watchmen-hbo-trailer-cast-release-date-news/">Watchmen </a>lit up Sunday night by turning down the colors, turning back the clock, and treating viewers to a faux-one take <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29862360/watchmen-hooded-justice-comics-explained/">Hooded Justice </a>origin story la <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGQ-U8QxHBo">Birdman </a>. Throughout the episode, a drug-induced flashback to 1938 New York and the first months of a new black police officer, a city-wide conspiracy takes shape. The plot, Cyclops, includes film projectors, police officers, and the Ku Klux Klan. In one scene, our protagonist, Hooded Justice, for sticking his nose where it dont belong, is strung up and half-lynched by his cop collogues. The episode culminates with Tarantino levels of retaliatory bloodshed (in black-and-white, of course).</p>
      <p>Watchmen has proved a regular observer of American racial history. The pilot opened with the <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29499509/watchmen-hbo-tulsa-massacre-1921-true-story/">Tulsa Race Riots of 1921 </a>. In the second episode, we saw the <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29588328/watchmen-hbo-german-message-black-soldiers-true-story/">maltreatment of black American soldiers during the Second World War </a>. And, true to form, last nights episode also recreated a disturbing moment in the history of American race relations: New York, 1922.</p>
      <p>Wait, was there ever a city-wide Klan conspiracy in the history of New Yorks finest? Not exactly. (Though, the name of that conspiracy in the series, Cyclops, is <a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2019/jul/25/triple-murderer-implicated-in-spokane-bombing-to-b/">also the name of a one-eyed Klan member </a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan_titles_and_vocabulary">Exalted Cyclops </a>is a position within the Klan's ranks.) While there was never city-wide video-hypnotizing ring, there was a Klan presence wearing blue.</p>

        <p>Bernard and Jon Whalens The NYPDs First Fifty Years: Politicians, Police Commissioners, and Patrolmen recounts the origins of New Yorks finest and their difficult beginnings. In 1922, after seeing a newspaper article on a Brooklyn Baptist minister who beckoned Klan recruitment into his congregation, New York Mayor John Francis Hylan <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=2bPTBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CFerret+out+those+despicable,+disloyal+persons+who+are+attempting+to+organize+a+society+the+aims+and+purposes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oDl6347hQZ&amp;sig=ACfU3U0IGk-Xt1RuxQg_Wy9jsEapVUAfNQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ppis=_e&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjTv4eqxPnlAhUE2FkKHY8gCXkQ6AEwAnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Klan&amp;f=false">sent a letter to Police Commissioner Richard Enright </a>, instructing him to go after the Ku Klux Klan and do not let them get a foothold in NYC.</p>
        <p>With a team of detectives, Enright compiled a list of eight hundred suspected New York Klansman. On the list: thirty members of Enrights own police department. Thats thirty boys in blue with <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29536835/watchmen-don-johnson-judd-crawford-comic-twist-easter-egg/">white hoods </a>in their closet. What happened to them? Nothing. They hadnt broken the law, it was concluded. So they stayed on the force. However, Whalen writes, the pressure on the Klan drove them underground. But only for a while.</p>
