      <p>Gale-force winds and heavy rain are set to lash the country as the remains of an Atlantic storm hit our shores.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow looks like being the worst day of an unsettled weather week, according to Met Éireann.</p>
      <p>Forecaster Vincent O'Shea said: "There is a system in the mid-Atlantic. It has some origins in an extra-tropical storm there.</p>
      <p>"It is getting caught up in a strong westerly jet which is coming our way during the night into Tuesday morning.</p>

      <p>"We hope that its prognosis is for it to decrease but, nevertheless, by the time it passes the south coast of Ireland on Tuesday, it still will be a vigorous depression by our standards.</p>
      <p>"At this stage, it looks like more heavy rain unfortunately on Tuesday morning."</p>
      <p>He said that there will also be gales, particularly in the southern half of the country, which will bear the brunt of both the heavy rain and strong winds.</p>
      <p>"The winds will change around and vary a lot, but almost certainly several coastal counties will have strong gales.</p>
      <p>"This eventually heads in towards the Bristol Channel," said Mr O'Shea.</p>
      <p>Its exact track will determine how strong the winds are. Met Éireann will continue to monitor the situation.</p>
      <p>Overall, it is going to be a very changeable and unsettled week, he said.</p>
      <p>Temperatures for the week ahead however will be improved compared with the past week, which has been unusually cold.</p>
      <p>"There was a lot of frost last week," Mr O'Shea said.</p>
      <p>"Going towards the weekend, there will be some colder nights. We are not expecting widespread frost.</p>
      <p>"Daytime temperatures will be in the region of 9C to 12C, or 8C to 11C."</p>
