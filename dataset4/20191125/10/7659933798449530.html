      <p>Philippine soldiers on Monday rescued a British man and his Filipino wife from ISIS-linked militants nearly two months after the couple were kidnapped from their beach resort in the nation's south, authorities said.<br/><br/>Troops recovered the pair after a firefight with gunmen from the Abu Sayyaf group on the restive southern island of Jolo, which is a stronghold of the kidnap-for-ransom gang that has been behind some of the worst attacks in the Philippines.<br/><br/>"There was a brief exchange of fire, but they later abandoned the couple after being overwhelmed by pursuing government forces," Lieutenant General Cirilito Sobejana told AFP.<br/><br/>Regional army spokesman Arvin Encinas said no ransom was paid. <br/><br/>British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab confirmed the rescue of the couple, saying "both Alan and Wilma Hyrons are safe and well, and being looked after by the Philippine authorities."<br/><br/>"We worked closely with the Government of the Philippines on Alan and Wilma's case over the last two months," he added in a statement.<br/><br/>Armed men abducted the couple on October 4 as some villagers watched in shock at a beach resort on the southern island of Mindanao, which makes up the southern third of the Philippines.<br/><br/>Troops killed a “high-value” but little-known Abu Sayyaf commander, Talha Jumsah, on Friday near Sulu’s mountainous Patikul town. Jumsah acted as a key link of ISIS to local militants and helped set up a series of deadly suicide attacks in Sulu this year. <br/><br/>Dutch birdwatcher Ewold Horn, who was kidnapped in 2012 in the southern Philippines, was killed in May during a firefight between his Abu Sayyaf captors and the military. </p>
