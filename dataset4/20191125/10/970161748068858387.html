      <p>However, Goo Hara’s friends and family will be able to pay their respects at a separate location.</p>
      <p>The agency added: ‘In accordance with the wishes of the family, who hoped to hold a quiet funeral, we have arranged for a separate location [for fans] to pay their respects. We are overwhelmed with sorrow at having to relay the news of [Goo Hara’s] passing to so many people.’</p>

      <p>Concluding their message, the agency pleaded with fans not to turn up to the funeral home where her family will be paying respects, in order for ‘the deceased to make a peaceful departure’.</p>
      <p>‘Once again, we express our deepest feelings of grief,’ they added.</p>
      <p>Goo Hara was a member of the girl group Kara, which was originally made up of seven members, but the current line-up now consists of Hara, Gyuri, Seungyeon and Youngji.</p>
      <p>The singer’s death comes just months after she allegedly attempted to take her own life after leaving concerning messages on Instagram.</p>
      <p>The Mamma Mia singer had also shown distress after the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/14/k-pop-star-sulli-found-dead-aged-25-10913196/">death of former f(x) member and close friend Sulli</a> last month, as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/goo-hara-left-heartbreaking-message-for-friend-sulli-following-suspected-suicide-as-k-pop-star-found-dead-11211221/">Hara shared a tearful live video</a> with fans explaining that she couldn’t attend Sulli’s funeral because she was in Japan.</p>
