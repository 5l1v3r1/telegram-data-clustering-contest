      <p>This week the Buffalo Bills will play the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving, our most American holiday. Praveen Sethupathy will be watching. He has the most American story of Bills fandom of anyone I know.</p>
      <p>Usually I write about Western New York expatriates in this space, but today I am going to step aside and let Sethupathy tell his own story in his own words.</p>
      <p>I offer only these introductory remarks: This exceptional expat grew up in Brockport, where his father taught computer science at SUNY Brockport for almost 40 years. Sethupathy was so taken with the Bills as a boy of 10 that he and his sister wrote a praise poem published by the Brockport Post in 1992.</p>
      <p>Today Sethupathy is an associate professor of biomedical sciences at Cornell University and lives in Ithaca with his wife and their three children. They are all Bills fans.</p>
      <p>How he came to love the Bills is a story to celebrate on Thanksgiving, or anytime.</p>
      <h3>By Praveen Sethupathy</h3>
      <p>Autumn has always been my favorite season. Not because of apple picking, or the colorful foliage, or the crisp morning air in Western New York where I grew up. I do love those things, but they’re not why autumn feels like<i> home</i> to me.</p>
      <p>The fall reminds me of when I first felt American, and there is one real reason why: Buffalo Bills football.</p>
      <p>Though I was born in Canada and lived the first four years of my life in the United States, my earliest memories of childhood are from kindergarten and first grade in Chennai, India. My first language was Tamil. My favorite music was from Indian cinema. The action hero I favored wasn’t Superman, but rather “Superstar Rajinikanth,” an actor who was all the rage back in 1980s Chennai.</p>
      <p>When I arrived in second grade in Western New York, I was a fish <i>way</i> out of water. I didn’t know, sound like or look like anybody else. I tried to make friends, but I would inevitably slip up and say something culturally inappropriate, like the time when I innocently complimented a boy’s attire by saying, “Nice dress.” I didn’t fit in. I spent much of the year in the corner of the classroom reading alone, and sometimes wondering whether I was really American. Almost every immigrant has lived some version of this story.</p>
      <p>On the first day of school the next year, something changed. I met my third-grade teacher. Mrs. Malak had a sweet, inviting smile and was always kind. But what I remember most about her was her contagious passion for the Bills. She was a true Bills fanatic — all Bills, all the time, from her clothing to her classroom decor. I started watching football, and I, too, fell in love.</p>
      <p>I didn’t particularly understand the sport at first, but the more I watched, and the more I talked about it with my teacher, the more I started to bleed red, white, and blue — not only because those were the colors of the Bills uniforms, but also because at that I point I felt American for the first time. Football is as uniquely American as baseball and hot dogs, but baseball bored me and I was (and still am) a vegetarian, so football became my gateway to America. I was a fan of the Buffalo Bills. I felt I belonged.</p>
      <p>My most salient and fond memories of childhood center on the Bills. I remember praying earnestly to God that kicker Scott Norwood would make the late-game field goal in Super Bowl XXV against the New York Giants. (He didn’t.) I remember one of the best gifts my father ever gave me was a Bills winter jacket. (I treasured it for years.) I remember writing a poem about the Bills with my sister and having it published in the local newspaper. (I still have the poem today.) I remember the exhilaration I felt when an autographed photo of Bills QB Jim Kelly arrived in the mail. (I’ve since passed it on to my son).</p>
      <p>I remember playing ping-pong for three hours with my entire family as we listened on the radio as the Bills stormed back from a 32-point deficit to beat the Houston Oilers in the greatest comeback in NFL history. (It’s one of my best family memories to this day.) I remember lying in bed after each of the Bills’ four consecutive Super Bowls, suffocating in the pain of each loss. But in victory or defeat, I was a part of something. I was a part of what would come to be called the “Bills Mafia.” I was a part of American football. I was American.</p>
      <p>Today, I still enjoy football, but it doesn’t hold the same sway over me. As a scientist, I can’t look past the rigorous and high-profile studies conducted in recent years that have unveiled the true extent of the physical and mental damage associated with playing football, not only at the professional level, but also at the collegiate, high school and even youth levels. When my eldest son showed interest in playing the sport, I felt trepidation for what could follow.</p>
      <p>And over the past few years, as NFL players have used the national stage of football to protest racial discrimination by kneeling during the national anthem, I’ve seen how the controversy surrounding the game that brought me into America’s fold is not only an emblem of our times but also a reminder of how so many people of color struggle to reconcile the ideals of America with the realities they face in their day-to-day lives.</p>
      <p>I don’t need football to feel American today — I know that I’m American, and that I’m Indian, and I’m proud of both. But I will never forget that as a little brown kid with an accent trying to find his place, football gave me a home in America. The Buffalo Bills will always be an important part of my American story.</p>
