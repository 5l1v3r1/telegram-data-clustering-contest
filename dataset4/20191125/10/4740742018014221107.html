      <h1>Love Saves The Day festival secures licence to move to Ashton Court</h1>
      <h2>The festival will host its last event in Eastville Park in 2020</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:33:16+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:33</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Sumner</a></address>
      <p>Love Saves The Day has secured a licence to bring nearly 40,000 revellers to Ashton Court in 2021. </p>
      <p>Festival organisers say planning is still in the early stages, but they at least have North Somerset Council’s backing.</p>
      <p>As owner of the estate, Bristol City Council will also have to give its permission if it is to go ahead. </p>
      <p>Love Saves The Day has been in the 23,000-capacity Eastville Park since 2015 but <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife/love-saves-day-2020-last-3362060">organisers have confirmed 2020 will be their last year there</a>. </p>
      <p>North Somerset Council’s <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife/love-saves-the-day-moving-3541907">environmental health officers had voiced concerns</a> but they were resolved before a hearing was due to be held this week.</p>
      <p>The meeting was cancelled and the licence was granted. </p>
      <p>It allows festivals for up to 39,999 people to be held at Ashton Court estate during the late May bank holiday in 2021, 2022 and 2023. </p>
      <p>The event will be able to open from 11am to 11pm on the Saturday and Sunday each time with 10 to 12 live bands a day. </p>
      <p>In a recent statement, Tom Paine, one of the directors of Love Saves The Day, said: “We're looking at all options for 2021 onwards, but who knows where the Love Saves The Day adventure will take us next!</p>
      <p>“All our focus right now is on Eastville Park for 2020 and making sure that next year's show is the best one yet.” </p>
      <p>Love Saves the Day will be back in Eastville Park on May 23 and 24 next year.</p>
