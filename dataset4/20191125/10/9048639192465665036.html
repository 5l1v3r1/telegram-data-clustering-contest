      <p><b>SLIDELL, La. (WAFB) - </b>The Slidell Police Department released a surveillance video of a 5-pound chihuahua inadvertently putting a vehicle in reverse before traveling backward across four lanes of traffic.</p>
      <p>Officers reported a couple was pumping gas at a gas station on Gause Boulevard while their dog remained in the vehicle. A mechanical issue allowed the pup to switch gears without having to press the brake.</p>
      <p>The vehicle ended up in reverse and crossed a four-lane highway before eventually coming to rest at a gas station on the opposite end of the highway. Officers say one of the owners did sustain a minor injury while trying to chase down the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Despite the somewhat humorous nature of the situation, authorities stressed the importance of using caution when leaving pets inside of vehicles.</p>
      <p>“It is a miracle that no one was seriously injured and that no other vehicles were struck during this incident,” states a caption posted along with the video.</p>
      <p>The video can be viewed below:</p>

      <p>This is the second time in a week a dog has put a car in reverse and taken it for a spin.</p>
      <p>In Florida, police say when a dog’s owner stepped out of his car, the dog accidentally knocked the car into reverse, sending it in circles around the cul-de-sac for nearly an hour. <a href="https://www.knoe.com/content/news/Dog-takes-joy-ride-around-Fla-neighborhood-after-bumping-owners-car-into-reverse-565393812.html">You can read more about that here</a>.</p>
