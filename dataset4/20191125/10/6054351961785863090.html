      <h1>T.I. Sets The Record Straight On 'Hymen Checking' Gyno Visits With His Daughter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:36:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/Kyle%20Eustice" target="_blank">Kyle Eustice</a></address>
      <p>Los Angeles, CA – T.I. and Tameka “Tiny” Harris recently stopped by Jada Pinkett Smith’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/redtabletalk/videos/1803664559768440/">Red Table Talk podcast</a> to discuss the controversial comments Tip made about his 18-year-old daughter Deyjah Harris.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, he revealed he accompanies Deyjah to the gynecologist to <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53390/title.t-i-s-gynecologist-trips-with-his-daughter-to-check-her-hymen-sparks-backlash">“check her hymen,”</a> causing an immediate firestorm of criticism. During the episode, Pinkett Smith got straight to business and confronted Tip about the admission.</p>
      <p>“I came to clear up any misconceptions that have been surrounding how we interact and parent and what is appropriate and inappropriate,” he says. “I think all this surrounds a conversation that I was having in a very joking manner when asked how do I deal with parenting in this day-in-age.</p>
      <p>“And so I just began, from a place of truth, I began to embellish and exaggerate. I think that a lot of people kind of like took it extremely literal. If you put any of my reputation, who I am as a father, who I’ve been, I honestly thought people knew me better than that.”</p>

      <p>Tip confessed, at the time, he didn’t understand the “sensitivity” surrounding the issue but does now. However, he still believes people jumped to their own conclusions.</p>
      <p>“My intentions have been terribly misconstrued and misconceived,” he continued. “Never said I was in any exam room, that is an assumption. That is a falsity. Never said it was being done present day as an 18-year-old. I never said her mother wasn’t present. Her mom was present every time.</p>
      <p>Tiny weighed in, “She was 15, 16 years old at the time. Most fathers don’t go, but he was just present. And he didn’t make the doctor’s appointment.”</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.50896/title.t-i-believes-nipsey-hussle-was-murdered-because-of-jealousy-hate">Hustle Gang boss</a> added this “false narrative has been sensationalized” but was incredible remorseful when it came to how the backlash affected his daughter.</p>
      <p>“She did have problem with me talking about it, however, and I understand that,” he said. “I am incredibly apologetic to her for that. [Looks at the camera] To you, sweet Baby Dayja. Not to these other strangers, any of these weirdos who toss lies around for fun. She understands my intentions and she knows who I am and she knows who I’ve always been. That allows a certain level of understanding.”</p>
      <p>T.I. made his original comments during a conversation with the “Ladies Like Us” podcast, which is co-hosted by Miguel’s wife Nazanin Mandi. In the wake of the public outcry, that particular episode has been <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53400/title.podcasters-delete-t-i-gynecology-episode-in-shame">deleted.</a></p>
