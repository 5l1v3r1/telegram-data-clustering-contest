      <h1>Tottenham trio backed to replicate Liverpool's front three under Jose Mourinho</h1>
      <h2>Harry Kane, Lucas Moura and Heung-Min Son all started against West Ham and have been tipped to provide an attacking threat to match the Reds' dynamic trio</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:47:21+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:47</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Garth Crooks believe Jose Mourinho's decision to start Heung-Min Son, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> shows that he is looking to replicate Jurgen Klopp's success with a three-pronged attack at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>The German manager regularly plays Sadio Mane, Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino together, and they scored a combined total of 56 goals in the Premier League last season.</p>
      <p>Previous Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino rarely started Moura in particular, but writing in his <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50539143">BBC Sport</a> team of the week column, Crooks said he felt the three players could form a lethal partnership in the future.</p>
      <p>"It's great to see Son enjoying his football again after the Andre Gomes incident," he said. "The South Korea international gave a blistering performance against a West Ham side that couldn't lay a glove on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> for 60 minutes.</p>

      <p>"Mourinho's decision to play Son alongside Harry Kane, Moura and Alli away at the London Stadium proved fatal for the Hammers. It's still very early days but Son, Kane and Moura could do for Spurs under Mourinho what Mane, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah have done for Liverpool."</p>
      <p>All three of the players mentioned scored in Spurs' 3-2 victory over the Hammers, and Spurs will be hoping they can continue that goalscoring form into the busy Christmas period.</p>
      <p>Mourinho's side face Olympiacos in the Champions League on Tuesday knowing victory would secure qualification for the knockout stages, and then host <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> on Saturday.</p>

      <p>The Portuguese boss appeared satisfied with his side's win in his post-match press conference.</p>
      <p>He said: "It was very very important. 11 months without music in the away dressing room, without a smile or happiness. They did it. I am very happy for them and with them. If someone only saw the result they'd have thought it was very difficult for us.</p>
