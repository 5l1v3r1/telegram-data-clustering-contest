      <h3>THE Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) welcomed the plans of some lawmakers to file a bill making the agency  tax-exempt  so it could have more funds for its charity program.</h3>
      <p>“We are a charity agency supposedly hindi dapat kami i-tax kasi kung anuman pumapasok sa amin, ibinibigay din namin,“ PCSO Director Sandra Cam said when asked to comment on the proposal of Albay 1st District Rep. Edcel Lagman to tax-exempt the PCSO.</p>
      <p>Cam stressed that with the tax exemption, the PCSO, particilarly  its Individual Medical Assistance Program, could give more financial aid to the people in need.</p>
      <p>Last August, PCSO General Manager Royina Marzan-Garma floated the idea of the tax exemption during a House hearing.</p>
      <p>Garma said it was urgent to revisit taxes imposed on the PCSO.</p>
      <p>In the House deliberations on the PCSO’s proposed 2020 budget, Garma said PCSO submitted an estimated P16.7 billion taxes in 2018 after the agency earned a total of P63 billion.</p>
      <p>The IMAP, the PCSO’s flagship program, aims to lend hand to people with health problems.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the PCSO head also said that 85 percent of their earnings would go directly to its assistance programs.</p>
      <p>Lagman agreed with Garma saying it is necessary to lower the taxes being paid by PCSO or exempt the agency.</p>
      <p>Lagman explained the “C” in PCSO stands for charity.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Cam agreed to Garma’s proposal that the PCSO should not give mandatory contribution to government agencies.</p>
      <p>The PCSO serves as the principal government agency for raising and providing funds for health programs, medical assistance and services, and charities.</p>
      <p>Aside from the IMAP, the PCSO’s other charity programs include the endowment fund, institutional partnership, procurement of medical equipment, AFP/PNP health facilities capability building project, calamity assistance, milk feeding, integrated health for overall productivity and empowerment (I-HOPE), and out-patient services, among others.</p>
      <p>“We encourage the public to give to PCSO by supporting and patronizing our products. With your P10 or P24, you do not only give a shot to becoming a millionaire but also get a chance to do the noble act of helping others through the charity programs and services of PCSO,” Garma said. </p>
