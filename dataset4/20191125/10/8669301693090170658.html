      <h1>After Saina Nehwal, Kidambi Srikanth pulls out of Premier Badminton League fifth season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:51:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:51</time> by <a rel="author">Scroll Staff</a></address>
      <p>After Saina Nehwal <a href="https://scroll.in/field/944734/saina-nehwal-pulls-out-of-the-fifth-season-of-the-premier-badminton-league">pulled out from the upcoming edition of the Premier Badminton League</a> on Sunday, it was the turn of another former world No 1 to do the same on Monday. Men’s singles shuttler Srikanth Kidambi announced that he will not be taking part in the tournament, to focus more on the international calendar.</p>
      <p>Srikanth, who has had a poor season on the BWF World Tour, has found some form recently when he reached the semi-final of Hong Kong Open. But, he has still not won a title on the circuit in 2019 and has seen his ranking slip to No 11 in the world.</p>
      <p>“It’s a tough road ahead. Need to go full throttle and fulfill the expectations that lie on me. Hence, I won’t be playing PBL this year to focus more on International events. Wish Raptors all the very best and hope for a smashing season this year as well,” Srikanth tweeted on Monday.</p>
      <p>The fifth edition of PBL gets underway on January 20, 2020. The upcoming season, which concludes on February 9, will be staged this time in Chennai, Delhi, Lucknow, and Bangalore.</p>

      <p>While the Srikanth-led Bengaluru Raptors had lifted the trophy in the last edition, Hyderabad Hunters, Chennai Smashers, Delhi Dashers, and Hyderabad Hotshots are the other winners of the franchise-based league.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Nehwal had confirmed her withdrawal from the tournament as well on social media.</p>

      <p>Scroll.in understands that more top Indian shuttlers will be pulling out of the upcoming edition, with some prominent names missing from the list of players made available for auction. A confirmation is expected after an official meeting.</p>
