      <p>The Poly D can still be used in monophonic mode, but you can also switch to Poly mode for playing chords, or choose Unison mode to get all voices stacked.</p>
      <p>Said to faithfully emulate the original Moog circuitry, the Poly D offers four VCOs. The first three feature triangular/saw, saw, square, wide pulse and narrow pulse waveform options, while the fourth can access triangular, reverse saw, saw, square, wide pulse and narrow pulse.</p>
      <p>You also get a classic 24 dB ladder filter with VCA, an LFO, BBD stereo chorus, distortion, a 32-step sequencer and an arpeggiator. Connectivity includes MIDI In, Out and Thru over USB and DIN and a range of control inputs and outputs.</p>
      <p>The Poly D has a 37-note full-size keyboard, and the upper panel - which contains 84 controls - can be tilted up for even easier access.</p>
      <p>If Behringer has got this one right, our prediction is that it’s going to fly off the shelves, but when it will be landing on said shelves - and how much it’ll cost - remains to be seen.
