      <p>Independent candidate David Gauke has posted a humorous video online in which he interviews a constituent who appears to have been persuaded to change political allegiance.</p>
      <p>The former Tory minister appears alongside Jim, a “dismayed longstanding Conservative” who Mr Gauke says is now backing him.</p>
      <p>“One of the things we are finding in this election campaign is lots of long-standing Conservative voters who are unhappy with the direction of the Conservative Party and are looking to vote elsewhere,” says Mr Gauke.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got one here, it’s Jim.”</p>

      <p>Jim admits that he has been a Conservative voter for over 50 years and that he has always been “middle of the road”.</p>
      <p>“I am dismayed what has happened to the Conservative Party now,” he says.</p>
      <p>“I could not vote for the Conservative Party now, or the Labour Party of course. Where I live I would have to vote Liberal Democrat.”</p>
      <p>Jim adds that if he were living in Mr Gauke’s constituency, he would “certainly” vote for him.</p>
      <p>Mr Gauke replies: “Thanks Dad,” revealing Jim to be his father.</p>
      <p>The candidate for south-west Hertfordshire announced he was standing as an independent earlier in November, after years of serving as a Tory minister.</p>

      <p>Whilst out interviewing constituents from south-west Hertfordshire, a reporter from PA inadvertently asked Mr Gauke’s wife to comment on his defection, to which she replied: “well I’m Mrs Gauke, so I probably shouldn’t.”</p>
      <p>Mr Guake responded to the incident saying that it was “probably for the best”.</p>
