      <p>The soul legend will headline Saturday, July 4.</p>
      <p>Bosses at Cuffe and Taylor, live music and event promoters and founders of the Lytham Festival said securing another international superstar was a major coup following legend Rod Stewart’s sell out performance last year.</p>
      <p>And they promised 2020’s festival would be another to go down in history as Lancashire music fans will also be saying ‘hello’ to a host of big name acts with Westlife, Lewis Capaldi, Snow Patrol and Little Mix all confirmed for headline slots at Lancashire’s biggest music gig, as it celebrates its 11th year.</p>
      <p>Festival director Peter Taylor said:“2020 is shaping to be yet another massive year for Lytham Festival.</p>

      <p>“We had an incredible line-up for 2019 as we celebrated our 10-year anniversary so our mission was to make 2020 even bigger and better, and we believe the festival we have planned will do just that.<br/>“To have Lionel Richie and Westlife on the same bill as Lewis Capaldi, Snow Patrol and Little Mix is incredibly exciting and really does make this our biggest ever line-up.</p>
      <p>“There will be tens of thousands of people descending on Lytham for the five days of the festival and we can’t wait to welcome them for what will be five truly spectacular nights of live music.”</p>
      <p>The eclectic line-up this year spans five nights, with Little Mix taking to the stage for Sunday’s closing slot, which has traditionally been reserved for the Lytham Proms.</p>
      <p>In a new development for the Festival, the Proms will be another night to remember, with a new home and date at Lytham Hall on Saturday August 29th.</p>
