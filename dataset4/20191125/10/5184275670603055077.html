      <p>Actor Tyler Perry has reached out to an Atlanta couple who had a medical emergency during a vacation in Mexico and cannot afford to pay the medical bill.</p>
      <p>Stephen Johnson and his fiancee Tori Austin were travelling on a Carnival Dream cruise ship when he suddenly fell ill and was diagnosed with pancreatitis, diabetes and a kidney infection, reports aceshowbiz.com.</p>

      <p>They ended up in Mexican hospital called Centro Medico Americano in Progreso, where he was treated with dialysis and other procedures to alleviate his condition.</p>
      <p>According to Good Morning America, he spent three days in intensive care.</p>
      <p>Once he was on the mend, the couple was charged with a <b>$14,000</b> bill that they’re unable to pay, because they don’t have health or travelers’ insurance. The couple says the hospital barred them from leaving until they make the payment.</p>
      <p>Austin says she asked if they could work out a payment plan once they were back in the US, but her request was denied.</p>
      <p>They claim the hospital locked the doors, a supervisor became physical in restricting them from leaving, and a threat was made to call the police if the couple tried to leave.</p>
      <p>In an interview from his hospital room, Johnson told CBS46 he was going through “hell”.</p>
      <p>He describes his situation: “I very much so am a hostage”. His fiancee added: “It’s been a nightmare. We just want to come home.”</p>
      <p>Austin says that they reached out to the US Embassy in Mexico to no avail.</p>
      <p>Their families later started a GoFundMe page, but it hardly reached the amount they need to cover the medical bill. Perry apparently caught wind of the couple’s situation and offered to pay it himself.</p>
      <p>According to tmz.com, the 50-year-old comedian/writer/director called up the hospital and gave them his credit card info to cover the tab, but the hospital requested that he wires the money, which he already did.</p>
      <p>The payment is expected to be accepted by Monday, and Johnson is scheduled to be discharged on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>There were concerns that Johnson would have to be flown back in a medevac plane, and Perry was prepared to cover the travel expense too. However, it turns out that he will be well enough to fly back in commercial flight.</p>
