        <b>Uber, the multi-national tech company that runs a ride-hailing mobile app, has not had its licence to operate in London renewed.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Transport for London (TfL) says it identified "several breaches that placed passengers and their safety at risk".</p>
      <p>Sky News looks at what happens in the immediate aftermath of the decision, and the impact on the app's users.</p>
      <p>How does Uber work?</p>
      <p>The app allows users to request taxi journeys from drivers who have signed up to operate on its behalf.</p>
      <p>Drivers do not work for Uber, but instead use the platform to connect to passengers who need a lift.</p>
      <p>Passengers simply request a journey through the app, and using their phone's location, drivers are able to accept requests or decline them.</p>
      <p>Uber then tracks the journey, and deals with the payment direct from the passenger to the driver, taking a commission for every journey.</p>
      <p>Why has Uber been stripped of its operating licence in London?</p>
      <p>TfL says it does not have confidence in the company, particularly around passenger safety.</p>
      <p>It claims that some of the drivers using the app could be uninsured and unlicensed.</p>
      <p>Uber had previously been given several months to make changes to the way it operates, including auditing its drivers, and the 25 November deadline comes at the end of a two-month extension.</p>
      <p>The ride-hailing app firm's existing licence expires at 11.59pm, but it will be allowed to continue to operate pending an appeal.</p>
      <p>Will I still be able to order an Uber in London after midnight tonight?</p>
      <p>Yes.</p>
      <p>Even though Uber's licence will expire at 23.59, the company is planning on appealing TfL's decision not to renew it.</p>
      <p>TfL made it clear in its statement that the tech giant could continue to operate in the capital during the appeal process.</p>
      <p>Uber said it will "continue to operate as normal" - so users should not see a change in its service.</p>
      <p>What are the chances of Uber being allowed to continue to operate in London?</p>
      <p>It is difficult to say what the end-game will be for the ride hailing app but Uber has been operating continuously in London since 2012.</p>
      <p>The company says it remains committed to working with TfL on a solution.</p>
      <p>TfL has imposed a number of conditions on the tech-giant, mainly around ensuring the safety of passengers, which will help secure its future.</p>
      <p>So, Uber could eventually see its permanent licence renewed if an agreement can be reached.</p>
      <p>What is happening to Uber in the rest of the country?</p>
      <p>Uber operates in around 20 locations around the UK, including Cambridge, Nottingham and Manchester, and as far as we know, will continue to operate as normal.</p>
      <p>Only Brighton and York have taken successful action to revoke Uber's licence so in the UK so far.</p>
      <p>Licences to operate minicabs are dealt with by local authorities.</p>
      <p>Passengers should be able to order lifts through the app as normal in the other cities in which it operates.</p>
      <p>What is happening to Uber in the rest of the world?</p>
      <p>Uber has had its share of controversies across the globe - but it generally operates without too many issues in many countries.</p>
      <p>In the US, a number of states have taken regulatory action against the firm, including where it is based in California, and only Italy, Hungary and Denmark have driven the company away so far.</p>
