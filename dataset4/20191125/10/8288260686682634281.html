      <h2>Aston Villa v Newcastle United | Dean Smith speaks candidly about his skipper who's set to return to the match-day XI for the visit of Steve Bruce's side at Villa Park this evening</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:57:09+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:57</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Preece, https://www.facebook.com/PreeceBirminghamLive/</a></address>
      <p>Dean Smith has lauded Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish ahead of tonight's crucial showdown with Newcastle United, declaring: "We go 'Wow!' at some of the things he does."</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old finally looks set to return to the starting XI after missing the last two Premier League matches with a badly-bruised calf.</p>
      <p>During his spell on the sidelines, Villa - without their skipper - have lost to Liverpool and then Wolves - and tonight's the night to get back to winning ways against Steve Bruce's Toon.</p>

      <p>"He's a top player," Smith explained while discussing Grealish's influence. "I stand with JT sometimes and we go, 'Wow!' at some of the things he does.</p>
      <p>"When top players are playing you have a better chance of winning, when top players aren't playing, you've less chance of winning.</p>
      <p>"It's the same with any top player at any club."</p>
      <p>Smith added: "Against Liverpool we lost his ball retention. I have no doubt that had he been on that pitch being 1-0 up with 10 minutes to go, he'd have bought some fouls and would have retained the ball in the top-half of the pitch for us. He didn't and we ended up losing the game.</p>
      <h3>Aston Villa - End of Decade</h3>
      <p>Welcome to our Aston Villa 'End of Decade' series.</p>
      <p>We're looking back on the 'Teenies' - the last 10 years at AVFC.</p>
      <p>It's hardly been a vintage time for Villa, but at least it is ending with plenty of hope and optimism with the Lions finally back in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>There's been some lowlights, and a smattering of highlights from January 2010 to now - and we'll bring you a host of them here.</p>

      <p>"Wolves? Listen, if he'd have played like the others we wouldn't have got anything out of it. But he's a top player, bringing goals to his game as well as assists now and that's all he can keep doing."</p>
      <p>Arguably Smith's most-memorable masterstroke to date was giving Grealish the captain's armband on his return from a shin injury at the start of the year.</p>
      <p>And, when asked about just how vocal he is around the training ground, the boss said: "He knows the football club, but he's not shy on his opinions as well. That is what I welcome from the players, to talk.</p>
      <p>"I'm very inclusive with the players in the debriefs we have and analysis. The vocal side off the pitch, it's something Jack's brought into his game a lot more. On the pitch he's not so vocal but he's a leader by example.</p>
      <p>"He'll take the ball even if he's having a bad game. There's bravery in that and, sometimes, that can get other players driven as well."</p>

      <p>As for what surely is an inevitable England call-up, Smith added: "We've had three international periods now and each time there has been speculation about him getting in there and he hasn't.</p>
      <p>"So the message has been, 'Just keep playing'.</p>
      <p>"You saw in October he was nominated for October Player of the Month, such was his form, so he all he can do is that.</p>
