      <h2>The biographic documentary was made by Adam Carolla and Nate Adams.</h2>

      <p>Following the recent release of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/ford-v-ferrari"><i>Ford V. Ferrari</i></a>, filmmakers Adam Carolla and Nate Adams have decided to honor <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/carroll-shelby">Carroll Shelby</a> himself and his life story in a new documentary titled <i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/shelby-american">Shelby American</a></i>.</p>
      <p>Where <i>Ford V. Ferrari</i> highlighted the two automotive companies in battle, <i>Shelby American </i>tells the story of how the son of a local mail carrier became an automotive legend. It comes from Carolla and Adams’ research for their documentary <i>The 24 Hour War — </i>which remembers the iconic <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/le-mans">Le Mans</a> race — as the two found out so much about Shelby’s life they felt it deserved its own work.</p>
      <p>Adams <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/11/24/shelby-american-carroll-shelby-documentary/?guccounter=2">said</a>, “The more research we did, the more we learned Carroll Shelby was an amazing character. It wasn’t just him, it was Phil Remington, Peter Brock, Charlie Agapiou, and the others he surrounded himself with. They were all incredible. We knew we had to devote an entire doc to him.”</p>
      <p>Spending another 18 months with Shelby’s family to obtain a deeper insight into his life, the two embarked on documenting interviews with his colleagues and competitors including Ferrari’s Le Mans team such as Piero Ferrari, John Surtees and Mauro Forghieri.</p>
      <p><i>Shelby American</i> is two hours long and features vintage racing footage, interview clips with Henry Ford II, a new interview with Edsel Ford II, and various others in Shelby’s life such as Bill Krause, who drove the second-ever race-ready Shelby Cobra.</p>
      <p>The documentary is available on DVD, Blu-Ray and is also available to stream on <a href="https://chassy.com/product/shelby-american/">Carolla’s Chassy Media website</a>.</p>
      <p>In other news, a <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/michael-jackson-biopic-in-the-works">Michael Jackson biopic</a> is in the works.</p>
