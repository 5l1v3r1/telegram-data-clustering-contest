      <h1>Return Zaldy Ampatuan to Camp Bagong Diwa -- prosecution panel</h1>

      <h3>The prosecution panel in the Maguindanao massacre case has asked the Quezon City Regional Trial Court to order the immediate return of former Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) Governor Zaldy Ampatuan to his detention cell in Camp Bagong Diwa in Bicutan, Taguig City.</h3>
      <p>In a manifestation filed before the sala of Judge Jocelyn Solis-Reyes, of QCRTC Branch 221, the prosecution led by Senior Asst. State Prosecutor Tofel Austria said  there is a need for Ampatuan to be returned to his detention facility as he might attempt to escape while the murder cases against him is now being resolved.</p>
      <p>Records showed that on  Oct. 23 order of the court, it noted the submission on Oct. 22 of a letter by QC Jail Annex Warden Supt. Jhon Montero informing the court that on Oct. 21, Ampatuan was rushed to the Taguig Pateros District Hospital and eventually transferred to Makati Medical Center  where he is confined at the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit. On Nov. 20, the court noted the Nov. 19 letter of Montero informing the court that Ampatuan is still confined in the hospital with final diagnosis of acute infarct, among others, and still undergoing continuous physical and occupational therapy.</p>
      <p>However, the prosecution observed that to date, it appears that Ampatuan is still being confined without definite date on when he will finally be discharged from the hospital.</p>
      <p>“In deference to this court, it should stop now extending so much grace, sympathy or concern to accused but has to act firmly and with an iron hand to prevent any untoward contingency while its decision is still underway,” the prosecution said.Cory Martinez</p>
