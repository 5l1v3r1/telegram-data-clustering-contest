      <p>Taiwan's MediaTek has announced a partnership with U.S. chipmaking giant Intel to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-25/intel-and-mediatek-partner-on-5g-laptops-for-2021">supply future Intel-powered PCs with fifth-generation networking modems from the start of 2021</a>. From a report:<i> The agreement marks a small step toward a big change in the way computing is done, as 5G promises to revolutionize both the speed and availability of cellular networks, creating dense coverage with bandwidth comparable to current Wi-Fi standards and beyond. Mobile computers stand to benefit greatly from this upgrade, and U.S. PC vendors Dell and HP have both been named by MediaTek among the likely first customers for the 5G-enabled, Intel-powered laptops that are to come. In July, Intel agreed to sell its cellular modem business to Apple for $1 billion, which the Cupertino, California company will use to speed up and improve design efforts around a 5G chip for its 2020 iPhones.</i></p>
