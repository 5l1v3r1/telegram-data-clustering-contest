      <p>Gardaí have arrested four men and seized approximately €1,100 of suspected cannabis herb following a managed pursuit in Clonmel, County <a href="https://www.tipperarylive.ie/">Tipperary.</a></p>
      <p>Shortly after midnight on November 24, gardaí from the Clonmel district were carrying out an Operation Surround checkpoint on Davis Road when they attempted to stop a car. The car drove off in the direction of Clonmel and was pursued by gardaí, who activated blue lights and sirens.</p>
      <p>The car was pursued for a short time until it drove into a cul de sac in the Rathkeevan area.</p>
      <p>Gardaí then arrested the four men, who were in their late teens and early 20s, and following a search of the car seized approximately €1,100 of suspected cannabis herb, which will now be sent for analysis.</p>
      <p>All four men were brought to Clonmel Garda Station and were later released.</p>
      <p>A file will be prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
