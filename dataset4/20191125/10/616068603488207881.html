      <p>True Leaf Cannabis company has landed licensing from Health Canada to cultivate, process and sell marijuana for medicinal purposes in Lumby.</p>
      <p>The license permits True Leaf to begin the three-step process immediately in their 18,000 square foot facility. The license also allows them to sell alternative pot products like edibles, capsules and topicals.</p>
      <p>"Today marks an important milestone for True Leaf as becoming a licensed producer helps support the continued development of our therapeutic pet care products," said Darcy Bomford, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of True Leaf. "Our facility is now licensed and meets EU GMP and HACCP standards. This is required for the ‘Cannabis 2.0’ market in Canada and also opens the door to export cannabis to the booming European market."</p>
      <p>While the licensing process was happening, the company expanded into the pet industry with a brand focusing on hemp and CBD-based pet products.</p>
