      <p>Uber allowed unauthorised drivers to pick up passengers they hadn’t been booked for in at least 14,000 trips, Transport for London (TfL) has said.</p>
      <p>This was caused by a ‘change’ to Uber’s systems, meaning the drivers could upload their photos to other workers’ accounts.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for TfL claimed that this was a ‘key issue’ in the decision <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/uber-banned-london-midnight-losing-licence-battle-11213996/">not to grant Uber London Limited a new private hire operator’s licence</a> after its latest application.</p>
      <p>They went on to say the incidents ‘put passenger safety and security at risk’.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson said: ‘This means all the journeys were uninsured and some passenger journeys took place with unlicensed drivers, one of which had previously had their licence revoked by TfL.’</p>
      <p>Another failure allowed dismissed or suspended drivers to create Uber accounts and carry passengers.</p>

      <p>Uber had previously taken steps to try and prevent this type of activity from happening – but TfL stated that the system was still being ‘comparatively easily manipulated’.</p>

      <p>The government body prosecuted Uber earlier this year for causing and permitting the use of vehicles without the correct hire or reward insurance in place.</p>
      <p>Jamie Heywood, Uber’s regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe, has now confirmed the company will be appealing TfL’s decision not to renew their licence.</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘TfL’s decision not to renew Uber’s licence in London is extraordinary and wrong, and we will appeal.</p>
      <p>‘We have fundamentally changed our business over the last two years and are setting the standard on safety.</p>
      <p>‘TfL found us to be a fit and proper operator just two months ago, and we continue to go above and beyond.</p>
      <p>‘On behalf of the 3,500,000 million riders and 45,000 licensed drivers who depend on Uber in London, we will continue to operate as normal and will do everything we can to work with TfL to resolve his situation.’</p>
      <p>Uber have 21 days to appeal the decision, in which they will continue to operate in London.</p>
      <p>The company may implement changes to demonstrate that it is fit and proper by the time of the appeal.</p>
      <p>Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said in a statement: ‘I know this decision may be unpopular with Uber users but their safety is the paramount concern.</p>

      <p>‘Regulations are there to keep Londoners safe, and fully complying with TfL’s strict standards is essential if private hire operators want a licence to operate in London.’</p>
