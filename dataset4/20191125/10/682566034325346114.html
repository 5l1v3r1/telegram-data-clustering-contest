      <h1>Injured Markram remains a doubt for Boxing Day Test</h1>

      <p>Cape Town - <b>Proteas </b>opener <b>Aiden Markram</b> remains an injury concern for the first Test against England at Centurion on Boxing Day. </p>
      <p>The 25-year-old has been out of action since he injured his hand in the second Test against India in Pune midway through last month. </p>
      <p>Markram had been dismissed LBW in the second innings of the match only for replays to show that, had he reviewed the decision, he would been given 'not out'. </p>
      <p>After seeing the replay and realising that, Markram punched the wall in a fit of rage and that decision could now cost him a spot in the side for Boxing Day. </p>
      <p><b>Sport24</b> understands that while Markram is showing marked improvement, he is still not out of the woods. </p>
      <p>While he managed to avoid surgery, Markram still had to spend around six weeks in a cast before beginning rehabilitation. </p>
      <p>The injury saw Markram fracture the capitate and hamate bones in his hand and he has had to slowly try and get mobilisation back and counter the stiffness. </p>
      <p>If Markram does not recover from the injury in time, then the Proteas will have to find another opening batsman to partner Dean Elgar at the top of the order. </p>
      <p>In the third Test against India, that man was wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock, with Heinrich Klaasen coming into the side to take the gloves off of him. </p>
      <p>That is unlikely to be an option against England, though. </p>
      <p>One man in the current Test set-up who might be considered a potential opener is Temba Bavuma while the uncapped Reeza Hendricks is another. </p>
      <p>England play four Tests, three ODIs and three T20Is against the Proteas.</p>
