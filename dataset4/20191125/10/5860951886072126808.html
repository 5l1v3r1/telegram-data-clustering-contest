      <p>The Department of Health (DOH) is currently coordinating with the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao – Ministry of Health to maximize immunization coverage and intensify polio vaccination efforts in Basilan. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III assured that the stocks of oral polio vaccine are sufficient and that preparations for the outbreak response immunization for the outbreak response immunization are underway.</p>
      <p>DOH reminded the public of the next round of Sabayang Patak Kontra Polio from November 25 to December 7 in the National Capital Region and the whole of Mindanao. All children under five years of age, regardless of immunization status, will receive a dose of the oral polio vaccine during the campaign.</p>
      <p>“I urge all parents and caregivers of children under five years old to take part in the Sabayang Patak Kontra Polio campaign and have their children vaccinated by our health workers,” Duque emphasized.</p>
      <p>Health workers and vaccination teams are set to go house-to-house to ensure that all children under five years of age are vaccinated. Health centers, government hospitals, fixed vaccination posts in barangays, malls, terminals, and fast food chains, among others, will also be  providing vaccination.</p>
