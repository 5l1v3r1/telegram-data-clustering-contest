      <p>LONDON: London’s transport authority on Monday refused to renew an operating license for the ride-hailing giant Uber because of safety and security concerns.<br/>“Transport for London (TfL) has concluded that it will not grant Uber London Limited (Uber) a new private hire operator’s license in response to its latest application,” it said in a statement.<br/>The rejection is the latest set-back to the firm’s operations in London, which have been targeted by protests from traditional black cab drivers to previous license suspensions.<br/>In September, Uber was granted a two-month extension to its license following the expiry of a previous 15-month agreement. The extension was conditional on passenger safety improvements.<br/>But TfL said on Monday there were a “pattern of failures,” including the use of unauthorized drivers on other drivers’ accounts, allowing them to pick up passengers.<br/>The transport authority said this happened at least 14,000 times, endangering users, as it invalidated insurance. Some trips took place with unlicensed, suspended or dismissed drivers.<br/>TfL said it recognized steps the company had taken to address such issues but was concerned about the ease with which its checks and balances could be manipulated.<br/>Legislation allows Uber 21 days to appeal and the company can continue to operate during this time.<br/>Helen Chapman, director of licensing, regulation and charging at TfL, said safety was its “absolute top priority” and the infringements were “unacceptable.”<br/>“It is clearly concerning that these issues arose, but it is also concerning that we cannot be confident that similar issues won’t happen again in future,” she added.<br/>There was no immediate comment from Uber, which will have to demonstrate on appeal that it has put in place sufficient measures to eliminate risks to passengers.<br/>Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said he backed the decision. He added he recognizes the decision would be unpopular but that companies need to play by the rules.<br/>“Keeping Londoners safe is my absolute number-one priority, and TfL have identified a pattern of failure by Uber that has directly put passengers’ safety at risk,” he said.</p>
