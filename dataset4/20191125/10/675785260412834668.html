      <p>A lorry driver accused over the deaths of 39 Vietnamese migrants has pleaded guilty to plotting to assist illegal immigration.</p>
      <p>Maurice Robinson, 25, who was allegedly part of a global smuggling ring, did not answer to 39 manslaughter charges when he appeared at the Old Bailey via video link from custody.</p>
      <p>Robinson, who is known as Mo, was charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration between December 1, 2018 and October 24, 2019.</p>
      <p>The bodies of eight females and 31 males were discovered in the trailer attached to his Scania cab in an industrial park in Grays, Essex in the early hours of October 23.</p>

      <p>They were found shortly after the container arrived in Purfleet, Essex, on a ferry from Zeebrugge, Belgium.</p>
      <p>The victims were later identified as coming from various provinces of Vietnam with the youngest being two boys aged 15.</p>
      <p>Robinson, who is being held at Belmarsh prison in south-east London, wore a light blue sweater and tan trousers and he spoke to confirm his identity and British nationality during the plea hearing.</p>

      <p>Appearing before Mr Justice Edis, he admitted conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration between May 1, 2018 and October 24, 2019.</p>
      <p>The charge states that he plotted with others to do "an act or series of acts which facilitated the commission of a breach of immigration law by various persons".</p>
      <p>He also admitted acquiring criminal property - namely cash - on the same dates.</p>
      <h3>Another suspect due in court</h3>
      <p>Robinson, of Craigavon, Co Armagh in Northern Ireland, is also charged with acquiring criminal property and one count of concealing criminal property.</p>
      <p>Another suspect, Christopher Kennedy, 23, is due to appear at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Monday accused of human trafficking offences.</p>
      <p>He was arrested in the early hours of Friday morning on the M40.</p>
      <p>Kennedy, from Darkley, Co Armagh, is charged with conspiracy to arrange or facilitate the travel of people with a view to exploitation and conspiracy to facilitate the commission of a breach of UK immigration law.</p>
      <p>His arrest came after it emerged one of the teens found dead in the trailer had gone missing from a centre for asylum seekers in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Extradition proceedings are underway in Ireland to bring Eamonn Harrison, 22, to the UK.</p>
