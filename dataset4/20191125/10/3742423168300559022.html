      <p>It's that time of year again when eBay slashes the RRP on a bunch of bestselling products as part of the Black Friday mega sales. eBay's best Black Friday deals so far include $100 off Canon EOS 3000D cameras, cheap BOSE QuietComfort 35 II Headphones, PlayStation 4 1TB Pro deals and $370 off Breville 'Barista Express' Coffee Machines. Here are the links!</p>
      <p>Black Friday is conveniently placed in that neat gap between regular life and the holiday period, which means it's a good time to nab some gifts for friends and family or, you know, yourself. Some retailers are jumping on the bandwagon a bit earlier this year in the lead up to the Big Day so we've rounded up a list of some of the best deals available on eBay <i>already</i>. Hide your wallets, they're coming for you.</p>
