      <p>After completing the shooting schedules in Bulgaria and <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/ranbir-kapoor-alia-bhatt-shoot-for-brahmastra-in-varanasi-view-pics/5cf10eab7195113f59d214e2">Varanasi</a>, lovebirds <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/an-injured-ranbir-kapoor-and-his-girlfriend-alia-bhatt-zoom-off-to-an-unknown-destination-pics-here/5ddb4a560cada251e9c31219">Alia Bhatt, and Ranbir Kapoor have now dashed off to Manali</a> to complete the last leg of their upcoming supernatural film, Brahmastra. The film, which is scheduled to release in Summer next year, also stars an ensemble cast of Mouni Roy, Nagarjuna and Amitabh Bachchan and is helmed to be a trilogy. Alia and Ranbir took to an early morning flight to jet off to Manali and we are sure the lovebirds are going to get a lot of personal time as well.</p>
      <p>As soon as the couple landed, pictures of them receiving a warm welcome in Manali are going viral on the internet. As seen in the pictures, Alia and Ranbir can be seen holding flower bouquets while wearing the tradition Pahadi multi-colour cap also called Pahari Topi. Ranbir and Alia can be seen posing happily for the cameras with the localities.

      <p>Since the news of <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/alia-bhatt-on-shooting-brahmastra-with-ranbir-kapoor-we-don-t-take-our-relationship-to-the-set/5cd6bb307415b36e49695466">their budding romance started making headlines</a>, netizens must have thought that it must be different for the actress to now shoot with her boyfriend-cum-co-star, Ranbir Kapoor. Earlier the Raazi actress had opened up about working with him and had told in.com. “We don’t take our relationship to the set. Ranbir and I are both very similar in our attitude to our profession. When we are on the set, we are there to work. And our approach to our work is very relaxed. We have no method or process as such. We both go into a scene instinctively. We do our shots, we talk, we eat… but otherwise, we both like to be left to ourselves when we are working. I think there’s a certain amount of space that all actors require on the sets. It was the same with Ranveer Singh during the shooting of Gully Boy.” <b>(ALSO READ: <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/photos/photo-gallery/lovebirds-alia-bhatt-ranbir-kapoor-twin-in-white-as-they-leave-for-brahmastra-shoot/5d0b927cae899b1f085c5d71">Lovebirds Alia Bhatt-Ranbir Kapoor Twin In White As They Leave For Brahmastra Shoot</a>)</b></p>
