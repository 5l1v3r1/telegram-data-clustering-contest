      <blockquote>"Critical observations have been made during works at the Baikonur spaceport on preparing the launch of the Progress MS-13 cargo spacecraft within the 74th ISS supply mission. As of now, the problems have been eliminated, and all the on-board systems are being checked," Roscosmos said.</blockquote>

      <p>The launch was initially planned for 6 December, but then rescheduled to December 1 at NASA's request not to hinder the docking of the US Dragon cargo spacecraft, also scheduled for 6 December.</p>
