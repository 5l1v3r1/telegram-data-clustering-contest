      <h1>Uber loses London operating license</h1>
      <h2>London Mayor Sadiq Khan cites thousands of fraudulent trips by unlicensed drivers in his condemnation of the app.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:42:38+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:42</time> by <a rel="author">Joshua Posaner, Melissa Heikkilä</a></address>
      <p>Uber just got canceled in London.</p>
      <p>In a serious blow to the ride-hailing firm, U.K. regulator Transport for London yanked Uber's operating license in the city on Monday over what Mayor <a href="https://twitter.com/SadiqKhan/status/1198908741548171264?s=20">Sadiq Khan</a> said was a "pattern of failure that has directly put passenger safety at risk."</p>
      <p>"I know this decision may be unpopular with Uber users but their safety is the paramount concern," he said in a statement. "At this stage, TfL [Transport for London] can't be confident that Uber has the robust processes in place to prevent another serious safety breach in the future."</p>
      <p>While Uber will continue to operate in London pending an appeal process, the move is nonetheless a substantial setback for a company that has spent the past year trying to reboot its presence in Europe following a number of clashes with regulators and national courts.</p>
      <p>In an interview earlier this month, a senior Uber executive told POLITICO the firm was <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uber-plots-reconquest-of-europe-via-smaller-countries-estonia-croatia/">eyeing smaller countries</a> in Central and Eastern Europe as growth markets thanks to liberalization of taxi sectors. Uber has also launched a fresh push into Germany, where its service had been banned in several cities.</p>
      <p>Yet London remains a key market where Uber has some 45,000 drivers and 3.5 million users.</p>
      <p>The Transport for London decision signals that Uber remains vulnerable to regulatory setbacks — even in places where it has been long established and has built up a major base of users.</p>
      <p>In his statement, Khan underscored some 14,000 “fraudulent trips” with unlicensed drivers taking over existing accounts as reasons for not renewing the license — an argument fiercely contested by Uber.</p>
      <p>Uber's regional manager Jamie Heywood called the decision "extraordinary and wrong," while confirming that the company would appeal.</p>
      <h3>Uber for safety</h3>
      <p>Uber's collision with Transport for London has been a long time coming.</p>
      <p>In 2017, the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uber-london-licence-transport-for-london-operate-win/">regulator revoked Uber's license</a> because it had failed to meet a so-called "fit and proper" test to hold a transportation license. The latest decision came at the conclusion of a 15-month probationary licence granted to the app in 2018, which was extended for a further two months in September.</p>
      <p>Uber, which was listed on the stock market in May and is trying to stanch losses in the billions of dollars, has introduced a number of new features aimed at addressing regulator criticism over recent years, including placing limits on driving hours in a bid to increase road safety and a 24-hour support line.</p>
      <p>“We have fundamentally changed our business over the last two years and are setting the standard on safety," said Heywood.</p>
      <p>Free-market advocates quickly cried foul, pointing to Uber's record as a job creator for low-income people.</p>
      <p>Matthew Lesh of the Adam Smith Institute, a libertarian think tank, called Khan’s move a "total disgrace."</p>
      <p>"Uber provides thousands of jobs for low income and immigrant Londoners. It provides a much-loved service to get people home safely at night. It is more affordable than other cabs and provides a flexible working life for drivers," he said.</p>
