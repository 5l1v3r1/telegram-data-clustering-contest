      <h1>(Vide) Fabinhoâ€™s brilliant late tackle v Crystal Palace helped Reds kill game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:46:22+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>This was a huge moment at the end of Crystal Palace v Liverpoolâ€¦</p>
      <p>With Roy Hodgsonâ€™s side pressing, Fabinho made a big, brave tackle that enabled us to launch a counter-attack.</p>
      <p>The fact he was already on a yellow made it all the more impressive â€“ although he is still suspended for the Brighton game next Saturday.</p>
      <p>All things considered though, thatâ€™s probably a smart one to miss â€“ as weâ€™re at Anfield and should be able to get the job done with either Jordan Henderson or Gini Wijnaldum at no.6.</p>
      <blockquote>This felt like such a pressure-relieving moment. <br/>87mins on the clock, holding a 2-1 lead. Fabinho with a characteristic tackle; his long legs nicking the ball &amp; finding his man for us to spring forward. <a href="https://t.co/DxB1zG33nu">pic.twitter.com/DxB1zG33nu<br/></a>â€” ðŸ”´ The Red Debate ðŸŽ™ (@TheRedDebate) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRedDebate/status/1198852492899094529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2019</a></blockquote>
