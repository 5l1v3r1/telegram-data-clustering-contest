        <b>Warning: Spoilers for episodes five and six of HBO’s Watchmen series and the comic ahead.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Have you recovered from the latest big twist in HBO’s Watchmen series? Neither have we. If episode five made your jaw hit the floor then episode six – titled ‘This Extraordinary Being’ – will have sent you reeling, especially if you’re a long-time fan of the source material.</p>
      <p>There had been clues, but we now finally have confirmation that Will Reeves, the wheelchair-bound grandfather of Angela Abar, is Hooded Justice. The identity of the first-ever costumed vigilante has been the source of constant speculation and fan theories <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> all the way back to the graphic novel. With episode six’s events revealed in a series of flashbacks – after Angela swallowed all of Will’s Nostalgia pills at the end of episode five – it turns out that Hooded Justice wasn’t who he was suggested to be originally.</p>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/watchmen-episode-6-significance-of-hooded-justice-being-revealed-as-that-major-character-explained-11209974/">Why is this important?</a> Well, according to the memoirs of original Nite Owl Hollis Mason – a member of the Minutemen, like Hooded Justice and Captain Metropolis – in the comics, Hooded Justice was said to be a strong circusman Rolf Muller. This was retconned in prequel comic Before Watchmen #6, where it was implied that Hooded Justice was in fact Rolf’s son Ward.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Of course, this isn’t the case as we now know that Hooded Justice was Will all along. Not only that, but we have confirmation that it was the ex-vigilante who killed Detective Judd Crawford in the show’s opening episode, and how he had the means to do so. Utilising the mesmerism – or, put simply, mind control – techniques employed by the racist organization known as Cyclops, Will lures Angela’s superior to his death by hanging himself. In doing so, he got some semblance of revenge on the white supremacists who have caused so much pain and anger for him throughout his life.</p>
      <p>His overall master plan – a scheme that Lady Trieu seems involved in given their discussions in episode four – is yet to be revealed though. We don’t know how this all ties into what the Seventh Kavalry have planned yet either, but things are sure to come to a head in the next episode or two.</p>
      <p>If episode six’s revelations shocked you to your core, you’re not alone. Angela King, who stars as Abar and her alter-ego Sister Night, revealed that she ‘couldn’t believe what was happening’ every time showrunner Damon Lindelof sent her a new script to read. Hooded Justice’s reveal, in particular, knocked her for six after she received the script ahead of filming.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Damon would get a text from me every time I got a script that would be like – I wouldn’t even put “WTF”; I’d write the whole thing out!’ King exclusively told Metro.co.uk. ‘I’m sure each time he knew the scripts were going out that he was anticipating getting those texts from me. We have such a powerful cast of actors, and to see their interpretation of it… I just can’t wait [to see it again].</p>
      <p>‘I think each episode trumps the last,’ she continued. ‘Just when you’ve had a question answered Damon just like mows you down with four new ones. You think “Damn, what is happening?! I cannot collect myself fast enough.” That’s so adventurous and I feel like we’re lucky as audience members to get something like this.’</p>
      <p>The latest reveal won’t come as a surprise to everyone, though. According to King, the preceding chapters have hidden clues that, if you’re paying attention, allow you to work out who Hooded Justice is before his identity is divulged.</p>
      <p>‘You’ll find something that you missed before, I promise you, if you watch them again,’ the 48-year-old confirmed. ‘I did when I watched the first episode. I saw it for the second time and I was like, “That’s right, we did that.” There are little visuals that aren’t Easter eggs. They’re things that make you go, “Wow, foreshadowing right there.”’</p>

      <p>Will’s decision to use the hood and rope that members of Cyclops almost hung him with, as part of his Hooded Justice costume, led the way for other vigilantes to conceal their true identities. It’s a ploy that Sister Night, Looking Glass, and others utilise throughout the show to keep themselves and their families safe. King, however, believes there’s a metaphor behind costumes heroes wearing masks that viewers can relate to, even if our own masks aren’t physical.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘I felt that, when I read the pilot, I clearly saw a person that’s like all of us,’ she explained. ‘We switch masks to adapt to whatever situation we’re in. Someone can meet you at the office party and say, “Oh my God she’s so quiet” and then they can see you at home and that is not the case. We switch masks to protect ourselves sometimes, to be more comfortable, to protect others, and I saw that in the pilot episode. Angela read that way to me, so it was kinda – I identified quickly so I could make these small, subtle differences that exist when she’s Angela in front of the kids at school, Angela the mom at home with the kids or the Crawfords.’</p>
      <p>Despite Hooded Justice’s identity being revealed, not everyone will view this as canon. Some fans, like Watchmen creator Alan Moore, might disregard the series as a true sequel to the comics and reject the idea of Will Reeves being the man underneath the hood. Showrunner Damon Lindelof has confirmed that HBO’s Watchmen isn’t a direct sequel to the graphic novel, so Hooded Justice’s identity is open to interpretation. King, though, thinks that Lindelof wouldn’t have taken on the difficult task of producing a follow-up to the legendary novel, and respects that people will have different opinions on where the show goes in its final three episodes.</p>
      <p>‘Damon was very smart in making it clear that this is not a sequel,’ the Oscar winner said. ‘This is not a remake, so don’t expect that. But do know that if anyone is respecting the original material it is him. He wouldn’t touch it if it was not respectful of it. I think that it’s really great.’</p>
