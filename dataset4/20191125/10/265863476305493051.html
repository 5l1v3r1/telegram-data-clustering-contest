      <h1>Miley Cyrus And Cody Simpson – Inside Their Thanksgiving Plans With Her Family!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:49:57+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:49</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Mitchell</a></address>
      <p>Ever since they were first linked romantically, Miley Cyrus and Cody Simpson have been spending most of their free time in each other’s company so it makes sense that the holidays will be no exception! The singer pair are reportedly taking their relationship to another level by spending Thanksgiving with her family!</p>
      <p>One insider tells HollywoodLife that ‘Cody will be spending the holiday with Miley and her family at her place in Nashville. Things are going really well between them. Having him in her life is nothing but positive right now. Her family is looking forward to having him there for the holidays. He fits right in with them.’</p>
      <p>As you may remember, the couple was first seen kissing back in October so while they’ve been friends for years, their romance started not too long ago.</p>
      <p>Regardless, it sounds like they’re moving pretty fast!</p>
      <p>But at the same time, it makes sense as it turns out that it was not really their first time stepping out of the friend zone.</p>
      <p>During a live stream on October 20, Miley revealed that ‘I can’t remember [where we kissed]. Probably a dirty a** nightclub. Like four freaking years ago?’</p>
      <p>Cody then said it was back in 2016 at a nightclub in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>That being said, it would be right around the time Miley and Liam Hemsworth had their second split that lasted from 2013 to the mid of 2016 so the timeline definitely fits!</p>
      <p>And since they have been friends for such a long time, Cody already knows Miley’s family pretty well which means that having Thanksgiving with them should not be too stressful at all.</p>
