      <h4>Early Game</h4>
      <p>Team IND’s Kratos was caught in rotation by GoSkilla and this resulted in an early loss for the team. Team IND fled from the scene since they were short on loot. The early game was very passive with most teams trying to get inside the zone.</p>

      <h4>Mid Game</h4>
      <p>IND lost three members to GoSkilla while they were trying to rush inside the zone. Tempo Storm and SynerGE fought a close battle in a compound and even though SynerGE landed the initial blow, it was Tempo Storm that came victorious with 4 kills. Team INS’s misery continued in game 15th as the entire team was wiped out by Red Canids in an open field.</p>
      <h4>Late Game</h4>
      <p>The last surviving member of IND was eliminated by Asterion Myth ending IND's run in the game. MEGA Esports, Asterion Myth and for a change Swat 69 made it to final safe zone of the game. MEGA Esports was the first team to get eliminated as they were in severe height disadvantage compared to other two teams. Swat 69 managed to knock two members of Asterion but with a man advantage, Asterion was able to secure the victory.</p>
