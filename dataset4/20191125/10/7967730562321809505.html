      <h1>How Bali's weather accurately predicts dengue fever cases in Australia</h1>

      <p>Outbreaks of dengue fever in Australia can be predicted with surprising accuracy by measuring rainfall and temperatures in Bali the previous month, new research has found.</p>
      <p>The research from the Queensland University of Technology's school of public health and social work has found a strong link between weather patterns causing a rise in dengue cases in Bali and a corresponding jump in cases reported here.</p>
      <p>Lead researcher Wenbiao Hu said it was clear Australian tourists were contracting the disease while in the popular holiday destination and bringing it back home.</p>

      <p>“Dengue in Bali is significantly associated with imported dengue in Queensland, New South Wales, Northern Territory, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia at a lag of one month,” Professor Hu said.</p>
      <p>“This study quantified the relationship between Bali and dengue in Australia, and gives new insight into developing a dengue early warning system in Australia.”</p>
      <p>Professor Hu said given the conditions in Bali correlated so closely with Australian outbreaks, authorities could theoretically develop a four-month window to respond to local clusters of the tropical disease.</p>
      <p>“The mechanisms behind this lead-time include a few weeks between suitable climate and increased mosquito activity and local dengue transmission in Bali, and the incubation time for infections in Australian travellers as well as time to diagnosis in Australia,” he said.</p>
      <p>Dengue fever is contracted through mosquito bites and causes symptoms similar to a bad flu, however extreme cases can cause serious fever, bleeding and extreme lethargy, and in very serious cases can be fatal.</p>
      <p>There is no vaccine against dengue and much of the research into the disease has focused on trying to control its spread.</p>
      <p>The disease is found locally in far north Queensland, where it is spread by a species of mosquito called <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, however it had not spread further south because conditions are not right for the mosquitoes.</p>

      <p>In particular the research paper highlights a cluster of dengue cases in the Brisbane area in 2012-2013, however there was no wider outbreak because <i>Aedes aegypti </i>are not found as far south as Brisbane.</p>
      <p>But Professor Wu said as the effects of climate change are felt, there is a strong possibility <i>Aedes aegypti </i>will start to be seen further south, meaning isolated outbreaks from Bali tourists returning home would become more dangerous.</p>
      <p>“At the moment in Brisbane for example we don’t have dengue here, but in the future we don’t know,” he said.</p>
      <p>“If <i>aegypti</i> gets here then you would see the disease rise in prevalence; at the moment we have relatively high levels of the disease but we’re lucky that the mosquito isn’t here yet.”</p>
      <p>“The life cycle of dengue viruses and the growth and survival of dengue mosquitoes is inextricably linked with climate.”</p>
      <p>It comes after Rockhampton saw an outbreak of dengue fever earlier this year, the first confirmed case for nearly three decades, prompting a "full outbreak response" from Queensland health authorities.</p>
      <p>The research has been published in the journal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935119302798"><i>Environmental Research</i></a>.</p>
