      <p>AMC finally named its third “Walking Dead” series on Sunday, when the cable channel also released a new trailer for the Spring 2020 launch. “The Walking Dead: World Beyond” also just cast Julia Ormond as a series regular.</p>
      <p>Ormond will play Elizabeth, the charismatic leader of a large, sophisticated and formidable force, according to AMC. Co-created by Scott M. Gimple and showrunner Matt Negrete, “The Walking Dead: World Beyond” also stars Aliyah Royale, Alexa Mansour, Annet Mahendru, Nicolas Cantu, Hal Cumpston and Nico Tortorella.</p>
      <p>“The Walking Dead: World Beyond” will focus on the first generation raised in the zombie apocalypse, according to AMC. Some will become heroes. Some will become villains. In the end, all of them will be changed forever. Grown-up and cemented in their identities, both good and bad.</p>
      <p>Produced and distributed by AMC Studios<i>,</i> “World Beyond” is executive produced by Gimple, Negrete, Robert Kirkman, Gale Anne Hurd, David Alpert and Brian Bockrath.</p>

      <p>“We are thrilled to have Julia join our merry band. I’m grateful for the talent, grace, intelligence, and humor she has brought to our set, our show and to this role,” Gimple said on Sunday. “We — and the audience — are very lucky to have Julia helping bring this new world of the ‘Walking Dead’ to life.”</p>
      <p>“I’m so thrilled to be working with ‘The Walking Dead’ team — I absolutely love how they write for women in particular; a lovely, talented cast and great to be back with AMC,” Ormond said.</p>
      <p>Ormond isn’t the only new name we got tonight. Natalie Gold, Al Calderon, Scott Adsit and Ted Sutherland will join “World Beyond” in recurring roles, AMC said in a press release. While we got character names for each — Calderon is Barca, Adsit is Tony, and Sutherland is Percy — only Gold’s got a description: Lyla is a mysterious figure operating in the shadows on behalf of the cause she believes in.</p>

          <figcaption>Netflix's new zombie apocalypse series, the "Z-Nation" prequel "Black Summer," is premiering Thursday, and what better way to welcome it than to rank other "undead" TV shows of the last few years from worst to best.

"Freakish" lasted only 2 seasons and had the worst Rotten Tomatoes score of the bunch. Critics said it suffered from thin, stereotypical characters, a flawed timeline and numerous plot holes.<cite>Hulu</cite></figcaption>

The show’s heroes embark on a quest to get the survivor from New York to California, where a lab waits to test his blood. Notable cast members included (DJ Qualls, Harold Perrineau).

"Fear the Walking Dead" - AMC<br/></b>Rotten Tomatoes score: 60%  <br/>For those who just couldn’t get enough of “The Walking Dead,” here is its prequel, which explores how the zombie apocalypse that dictates the story of “TWD” began. Though arguably not as popular as the original, the drama series has been going steady since 2015 and its fifth season will premiere on June 2.<cite>AMC</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>5.</b> <b>"In the Flesh" - BBC<br/></b>Rotten Tomatoes score: 96%  <br/>Hailing from across the pond at the BBC, this short-lived series only lasted two seasons. Taking place after the zombie apocalypse is over, it follows 18-year-old former zombie Kieren, as he attempts to reenter society. Fans say it gives a brain and a heart to zombie drama, as it's less about blood and gore, and more about examining the stereotypes and knee-jerk reactions that lead Kieren’s hometown to discriminate against him. Brownie points for using Daniel Johnston's song "Devil Town" in the trailer. <cite>BBC Three</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>3. "Ash vs. Evil Dead" - Starz<br/></b>Rotten Tomatoes score: 94%  <br/>This revival of the 1981 classic movie “Evil Dead” serves up action, comedy and lots of gooey-looking fake blood. The original hero Ash (played by Bruce Campbell) returns after 30 years to finally come to terms with what happened in that cabin. However, despite a near-perfect Rotten Tomatoes score and much to the shock and horror of its legion of fans, Starz canceled the show after 3 seasons due to low ratings, leaving the final season's cliffhanger ending just... hanging there.<cite>Starz</cite></figcaption>

"The Walking Dead" - AMC<br/></b>Rotten Tomatoes: 80%  <br/>While there's no question that this is the most talked about zombie show on TV, it can be argued that “The Walking Dead” has declined in quality since Season 1. But even though we ranked it at #2, there’s something to be said for a show that’s been going since 2010 with no plans to slow down for its 10th season in 2020.<cite>AMC</cite></figcaption>

To satisfy her craving, she and her husband Joel (Timothy Olyphant) set out on a path of death and destruction... together.<cite>Netflix</cite></figcaption>
