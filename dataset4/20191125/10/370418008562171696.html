      <p>Ahead of their upcoming stint on the road with <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/bury-tomorrow/">Bury Tomorrow</a> and <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/employed-to-serve/">Employed To Serve</a>, Harrogate hardcore punks <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/blood-youth/">Blood Youth</a> have just dropped a brand-new song.</p>
      <p>The track goes by the name Playing The Victim, and is the band’s first new music since the release of their February full-length Starve.</p>
      <p>“Playing The Victim is a song we actually wrote last year when we were writing Starve,” explains frontman Kaya Tarsus. “At the time we didn’t feel like it was quite ready for release, so we decided to take a step back from it. We revisited it this year and it turned into one of our favourite Blood Youth tracks. Lyrically, it’s about not letting the bullshit in life define and shape you. I really didn’t like the idea of constantly using bad moments in life as an excuse for being really distant and cold towards other people. It’s something I was really working on when I was putting together the lyrics. In many ways, Playing The Victim is one of the most positive songs we have ever written.”</p>
