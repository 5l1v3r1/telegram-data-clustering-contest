      <h2>Manchester United legend Paul Scholes dissected Chelsea’s defeat to Manchester City at the weekend as Frank Lampard’s side dropped points in the race for the top four</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:04:03+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:04</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Gibbs</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> legend Paul Scholes insists <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/frank-lampard">Frank Lampard</a> will have concerns over Chelsea’s failure to take points off the top teams.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> suffered a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/man-city-2-1-chelsea-20945552">2-1 defeat against Manchester City</a> on Saturday evening despite taking the lead through N’Golo Kante.</p>
      <p>The Blues still sit fourth in the Premier League table but have made a habit of playing well and either dropping points or allowing teams to get back into the match.</p>
      <p>Saturday was no different as Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez both found the net to ensure they took home maximum points.</p>
      <p>Chelsea have also suffered defeats to Manchester United and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in the league this term and Scholes feels Lampard needs to address the problem urgently.</p>

      <p>“They keep going to these big clubs, playing really well and not winning games,” Scholes told the Premier League.</p>
      <p>“That will be frustrating for him I think, because he knows he’s got quality in his team but he’s missing something.</p>
      <p>“He’s definitely missing something. He went to Manchester United, everyone said Chelsea were the best team, played really well, got beat 4-0.</p>
      <p>“Played against Liverpool, played okay I don’t think they were anything great against Liverpool, got beat.</p>
      <p>“Played against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , everyone’s saying the best team, they were really good, they played well, they’ve lost the game. Now he has to find a way of changing that.</p>

      <p>“There’s no point coming away from these games saying you played really well but lost.</p>
      <p>“Big teams win leagues through going to Manchester City, maybe not playing that well, but nicking a 1-0.</p>
      <p>“Like Manchester City have done today – not played very well but they’ve come away winning the game.</p>
      <p>“That will be frustrating for him, he knows he’s got a good team.</p>
      <p>Fikayo Tomori and Kurt Zouma started in the heart of Chelsea’s defence and Scholes feels the pair must get more comfortable on the ball if Lampard wants to play out from the back.</p>
      <p>“I’d be a little bit worried about his two centre-halves, the way he wants to play are they good enough on the ball?” Scholes added.</p>
      <p>“I think defensively they’re okay but they look a bit nervous on the ball to me, which can create nerves throughout the team.</p>
      <p>“Are they a centre-forward short? We know they’re missing Eden Hazard from last year, who’s a big difference we know that, he’s got the quality in these big games to win them.</p>
      <p>“[Lampard’s] got a really good team, but he’s got to find that way of winning in big games, and that will frustrate him for now.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea now turn their attention to their Champions League clash with Valencia on Wednesday evening (5.55pm) before hosting struggling <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> next Saturday (3pm).</p>
