      <p>Zee TV’s latest drama Dil Yeh Ziddi Hai marks the debut of Megha Ray. In the show, the actor plays Kajal, a bright and positive girl who finds out she is about to lose her eyesight. Not someone to accept defeat, Kajal fights all odds to fulfill all her dreams. Dil Yeh Ziddi Hai also stars Rohit Suchanti and Shoaib Ali.</p>
      <p>In the fourth edition of ‘new kid on the block’, we introduce you to Megha Ray. Born and brought up in Mumbai, she wore many hats – dancer, engineer and blogger – before venturing into acting.</p>
      <p>In an exclusive chat with <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a> Megha shared that her experience on social media not only helped her gain confidence but also saved her money as she did not have to get a portfolio done to send to casting agents.</p>

        <b>Excerpts from the conversation:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>From engineering to blogging to acting, how did it all come about?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I think that’s one similarity with my character, as we don’t plan anything in life. Personally, education has always been very important to me. I like reading and learning new things, especially science. I have also been always very inclined towards co-curricular activities. I got my masters in Bharatnatyam at the age of 11 and have been associated with Shaimak Davar’s team for a long time. But a few years back, I suffered an injury that stopped me from dancing and I felt empty. Since I had already secured a job, I decided to experiment. And someone suggested I should start uploading my pictures, given I enjoyed fashion. And that’s how my blogging journey started in 2016. As for acting, it was a secret childhood dream that I never confessed to anyone. But realising I still wanted to pursue it, I decided to quit my job and give myself a year. Now I think it was the best decision of my life.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How much of struggle did you face in that year?</b>
      </p>
      <p>So it hasn’t even been a year as I quit my job in January. I think I was lucky to have met the right people who encouraged me. Also my mom, she really pushes me as she believes in me. All this led to me bagging this beautiful project in just half a year of my struggle.</p>
      <p>As someone just starting her acting career, were you open to doing television or did you want to do films?</p>
      <p>Initially, I was looking at being part of good stories. But yes, I was not too keen to do television as we usually see over the top drama and not too relatable content. But when the casting director reached out to me for Dil Yeh Ziddi Hai, I was intriuged by the character. And when I finally heard the story, I prayed that I end up getting the role. And my prayers were finally answered.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How challenging is it to play a blind person?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I wasn’t told this would be a blind character. Only in the second round, I was told about the same. And I thought that this would act as a great trajectory. While she is not blind yet, in the coming days, you will see that she will prep up for the setback that she is going to face. But the best part is that it’s not a sob story, rather a very motivating and positive story. I have been doing some exercises so that I can understand what goes in their minds. It is a tough task to pretend to not see, and also look real.</p>
      <p>
        <b>And how are you dealing with the hectic work schedule of television?</b>
      </p>
      <p>(Laughs) I am still making peace with that. It is actually way more tough than I ever imagined it to be. I never thought I would have to work so hard. I have forgotten when was the last time I slept for eight hours. But I am also learning a lot of things including how to manage schedule, diet, etc.</p>
      <p>Since you started with blogging, what is your take on social media? Is it really important for actors to be active on social media?</p>
      <p>Like everything, it has its pros and cons. Honestly, I don’t pressurise myself, be it as an actor, influencer or social media blogger. I don’t put myself under unnecessary stress. I post only when I feel the need. Otherwise, I just cut off.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Finally, do you think blogging is a lucrative profession for youngsters?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It has brilliant scope. For three years, I made some good income from it. Also, today people write about so many different things, some quite offbeat too. While right now I don’t have much time to blog, but I will definitely get back to it soon. I have, after all, built it from scratch.</p>
