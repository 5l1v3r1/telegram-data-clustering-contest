      </p>
      <p>South African entrepreneur, Elon Musk, who is also the founder of Tesla Motors, on Friday, November 22, lost not less that $768 million following an embarrassing demo of the automobile company's latest electric truck tagged cybertruck.</p>
      <p>Musk had boasted that the much-talked-about truck was shatterproof, leaving his international customers in great anticipation.</p>
      <p>However, to his utter dismay, the windows of the truck was shattered by Franz von Holzhausen, the head of design, who threw a metal ball at them to test the hardness of the glass.</p>
      <p>In response to this, Musk tried to save his face and conceal his obvious embarrassment by saying: <i>"It didn't go through, so that's a plus side. Room for improvement."</i></p>

      <p>An unnamed automobile analyst speaking on the impact this might have on the entrepreneur, said: <i>"Musk has been enthusiastic about his Blade Runner-inspired design for months, but we were still surprised how futuristic he went with this one and believe it may shatter his dreams."</i></p>
      <p>Moreover, Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader, felt that Musk went somewhat too far with his design in a bid "to sell too much."</p>
      <p>Brauer added:<i> "There are fans out there who'll buy anything with a Tesla badge on it, but this will unlikely pierce the meat of the truck market. Tesla is putting up too many barriers for people nervous about stepping out of their comfort zone."</i></p>
      <p>Moreover, <b>Legit.ng</b> reported that <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276271-bill-gates-beats-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-reclaim-worlds-richest-man-title.html">Billionaire Bill Gates had officially surpassed Amazon Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jeff Bezos</a> as world's richest person on earth with a net worth of $110 billion (N39,765,000,000,000).</p>

      <p>The Amazon founder ended Gates' 24-year run as the richest man in 2018 with a net worth of $160 billion (N57,840,000,000,000). However, the Microsoft co-founder regained the lead on Friday, November 15, after Microsoft stock went up nearly 48% in 2019, helping boost the value of his stake in the tech giant.</p>
