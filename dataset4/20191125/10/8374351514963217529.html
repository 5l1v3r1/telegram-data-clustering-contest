      <h1>LVMH close to buying Tiffany for more than $16.3 billion: source</h1>

      <p>French luxury group LVMH was hoping to clinch a deal to acquire US jewellers Tiffany on Sunday after bidding more than $16 billion, according to a source close to the deal, confirming press reports.</p>
      <p>The deal would cost more than $16.65 billion once debt has been factored in, said the source, confirming reports in The Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.</p>
      <p>The two groups may officially announce the deal before the opening of the European markets Monday, the source added.</p>
      <p>The boards of both companies were meeting Sunday to approve the deal, with a good chance that they would both pass it, the source said.</p>
      <p>Analysts last week had said that a higher bid would clinch the deal.</p>
      <p>If confirmed, it would be the LVMH’s biggest acquisition and would allow the group to bolster its presence in the United States, currently its second-largest market.</p>
      <p>Such a deal has been seen as way forward for Tiffany, which has trailed rivals in terms of sales growth in recent years.</p>
      <p>LVMH, which is led by billionaire Bernard Arnault, is the owner of Louis Vuitton, Dior and Moet &amp; Chandon.</p>
      <p>The revised offer was the second time that LVMH raised it bid for Tiffany, which is something of a New York institution. The jewelers featured in the 1961 Audrey Hepburn film Breakfast at Tiffany’s.</p>
