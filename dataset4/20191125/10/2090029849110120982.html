      <p>Human Rights Activist and Co-Convener of Bring Back Our Girls (BBOG) <a href="https://lailasnews.com/aisha-yesufu-blast-buhari-calls-the-president-offensive-names/">Aisha Yesufu</a>, has called out President Muhammadu Buhari over his alleged plans to for for a 3rd term in office.</p>
      <p>If you recall Hon. Enya, Organising Secretary to President Buhari for the 2019 elections called for the amendment of the constitution to remove clauses hindering the President and state governors from running third terms.</p>

      <p>In her reaction to the clause, Aisha Yesufu made a vow that she would do everything possible within her powers to stop that and the President should not even bear the thought.</p>
      <p>According to her, if possible, she would call for a Referendum where the electorate would take the ultimate decision of agreeing or disagreeing with the third term Agenda.</p>
      <blockquote>In her words, “For this Naija where we dey, Buhari no go dare am, say he wan do third term. Say Wetin? We die for that nation. We sit down,  die for there.”</blockquote>
      <p>She said she refuses to be enslaved by the Buhari led-administration, asking the President and his party members to squash the plan.</p>
      <blockquote>“Anyhow that idea dey come from their head, make them squash am, make them squeeze am”</blockquote>
