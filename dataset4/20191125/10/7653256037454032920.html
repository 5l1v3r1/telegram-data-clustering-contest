        <i>At a time when growth in stock market is concentrated in select quarters, <b><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Swati-Kulkarni">Swati Kulkarni</a></b>, Executive Vice President and Fund Manager – Equity at <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/UTI-AMC">UTI AMC</a>, believes this is the right time to pick companies based on their 'competitive franchise' or businesses that enjoy a wide moat. Kulkarni, who manages a Rs 11,000-crore portfolio, said in an interview with ETMarkets.com that despite selling some pharma and IT stocks, she continues to be overweight on the sectors. Edited excerpts:</i>

      <p>
        <b>You often talk about 'growth at a reasonable price' approach to investing. Has the definition of 'reasonable' changed in recent years as most of the top names are more expensive than their industry average? Is there anything "too expensive" in the current market scenario?</b>
      </p>
      <p>GARP approach helps in identifying companies that have a long growth runway vs competition as also companies where the valuations do not factor in the likely improvement in business fundamentals.</p>
      <p>We need to consider the implied growth in earnings versus what the company has been delivering in the past. Sometimes, the changes in the business models and the competitive positioning of the company may make the comparison with historic multiples less useful. A company with strong competitive franchise tends to trade at a premium over others in the sector.</p>
      <p>Having said that, there are certain sectors, where the valuations have moved up considering the recently reported growth and/ or the expected growth in the near term. As a portfolio manager, we manage risk by position sizing the exposure to such companies.</p>
      <p>For example, considering the near-term growth outlook, some of the consumer names can arguably be considered expensive. But low penetration, urbanisation, premiumisation, shift to organised sector are solid trends from which, some of the companies will benefit over medium to long-term perspective. So, one can be underweight in this sector now and open to add if the equation of price and growth becomes reasonable.</p>
      <p>Understanding the competitive landscape of the industry is important in building your growth expectations. For the businesses that have pricing power or cost advantage; the growth runway is better than those without these benefits. These businesses tend to generate cash and invest at higher return on capital employed, thus creating value for their shareholders.</p>
      <p>In legendary investment Guru Charlie Munger’s words: “A great business at a fair price is superior to a fair business at a great price”. For such companies, even if you end up paying more than the rest of the companies in the sector, you will benefit from the value that such companies create over the medium term.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Some domestic fund managers and even <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/warren-buffett">Warren Buffett</a> have chosen to sit on cash rather than invest, given the "sky-high" valuations. What is your take on that? Would you suggest sitting on cash to wait for valuations to cool down?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is important to understand what your mandate is. When the investor has allocated to equity fund, as a fund manager, my mandate is to invest in equity and not to alter the investor’s asset allocation. My experience is that the stock picking brings performance rather than cash calls. At portfolio level, valuation risks can be managed by sector and stock positioning e.g. going overweight on sectors or stocks where valuation is comfortable, given the growth expectation and vice versa.</p>
      <p>From an investor’s perspective, what is important is having proper asset allocation to meet financial goals and create wealth over the long term, rather than hoping to time the market. The risk of having very little equity allocation could hurt more, especially given the fact that equity funds have generated inflation beating superior returns over a long term vs other asset classes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Despite efforts from RBI, the government and other agencies to restart the engines of growth, the slowdown is deepening. This has definitely hurt the midcaps and smallcaps, if not the largecaps. Is this the right time to select companies based on their 'competitive franchise'?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes. Companies with competitive franchise or wide moat enjoy the benefits of pricing power or cost efficiency which gets reflected in their fundamentals e.g. well-managed capital structures, high return on capital, consistent cash-flows generation. Even though the macro trends may affect the overall sector growth, such companies tend to handle the challenges better and are able to invest for growth without much balance-sheet risk, when the demand outlook improves. We review the competitive landscape regularly for any signs of weakening franchise, so that we act quickly.</p>
      <blockquote>High RoCE, strong cash flows and reasonable valuations are key thoughts for staying overweight in IT.<br/>-Swati Kulkarni</blockquote>
      <p>Since the valuation in midcap and smallcap segments are now back to their long-term levels versus the largecap on one-year forward PE multiples, we have selectively added exposure. In UTI Mastershare, we have invested about 11% in mid and small cap companies that have strong competitive franchise.</p>
      <p>
        <b>It is usually advised to diversify across market segments, i.e., allocating some portion to mid and smallcaps. But in recent times, that strategy has more often than not hurt the retail investors. What would be your advice to your panic-stricken customers?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Equity is a long-term investment tool; short-term volatility is a distraction. Investors may follow core and satellite approach while planning their equity mutual fund investments. Broadly, core allocation can be 50-60% in the largecap and multicap funds; under satellite approach, 20-30% allocation can be made to mid cap funds and 10-15% allocation to thematic funds can be considered. Best way to deal with greed and fear is to stay disciplined with investments and review the desired asset allocation rather than reacting in panic. Deep corrections probably make stocks cheaper and investors redeeming in panic give away the potential gains.</p>
      <p>
        <b>In all three funds that you manage, you have sold IT and pharma stocks in recent months. Can you please tell our readers your investment thesis there?</b>
      </p>
      <p>IT and Pharma continues to be overweight at the sector level. We have booked profit in a few IT stocks as the prices were attractive and reallocated that in certain other companies within the sector. In pharmaceutical sector also, we have made certain changes in company allocation.</p>
      <p>High RoCE, strong cash flows and reasonable valuations are key thoughts for staying overweight in IT.</p>
      <p>In pharma, our preference has been for companies with a strong presence in domestic and chronic segments, where steady growth is expected for a long term.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You have also added banks to your portfolio. However, they have already gained quite a bit in recent years, especially the private ones. Do you still see pockets of opportunity there?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The market rewarded the balance sheet clean up by the banks in last two years and we got the benefit from our overweight position in private corporate banks. Going forward, we believe with capital adequacy and better asset quality, banks and strong NBFCs are in a much better position to participate in growth potential.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the near-term growth slow down, Indian economy has a structural advantage of domestic demand and infrastructure investment potential. So, opportunities are still there considering the growth potential and reasonable valuations. Besides banks and NBFC, opportunities exist in multiple non lending businesses given the low penetration led growth potential.</p>
      <p>In banking and financial services sector, we have reallocated exposure within the NBFCs by exiting a few where we thought the competitive positioning is changing.</p>
