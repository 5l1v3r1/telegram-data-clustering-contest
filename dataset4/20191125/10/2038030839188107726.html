      <h1>Taylor Swift just had the last word at The American Music Awards 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:13:38+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:13</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Isaacs</a></address>
      <p>Cape Town – In case you missed it the last week was pretty traumatic for Taylor Swift, which was unfortunately preceded by a year of drama. Yes, she's in love with a very young Brit, named Joe Alwyn and <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Music/AlbumReviews/review-taylor-swift-lover-20190823"><b>released an album all about it</b></a>, but that's the sunny part of an otherwise gloomy time in the talented artist's career.</p>
      <p>You see, when Taylor first started out, she signed a contract with Big Machine Records, run by Scott Borchetta which gave the company ownership of her master recordings.</p>
      <p>When you own master recordings, you then get a cut every time the songs are sung or performed or streamed etc. Taylor's contract with the company eventually ended after some of her biggest records like <i>1989</i> and <i>Red</i> were released. Scott then, without reportedly telling the songwriter, sold her master recordings to Scooter Braun, who has some serious beef with Tay Tay going back years.</p>

      <p>Anyway, cut to 2019 when Taylor is going to be honoured at The American Music Awards for her incredible career with the artist of the Decade Award. Obviously, the <i>Lover </i>hitmaker wanted to perform more of her classic hits, which she wrote herself, at the ceremony, to which, she alleges in a public Tumblr post that Scooter said no to unless she did what he reportedly wanted her to do.</p>

      <p>Eventually, Taylor could perform her own songs at the ceremony and Scooter then alleged that he and his family had received death threats because of Taylor's post. Obviously, the story doesn't end there, and Taylor had the last, subtle word at the awards ceremony which took place on Sunday 24 November 2019. </p>

      <p>Taylor's subtle shade started when she thanked her new label for supporting her as an artist. She said: "This album really felt like a new beginning, and I also really love my record label, Universal and Republic," Swift said onstage. "Thank you for being so generous to me and allowing me to make whatever music I want to make. As a songwriter, it's so thrilling to me that I get to keep doing that."</p>
      <p>As you will have read in our earlier piece, Taylor now owns her own masters in terms of her new contract.</p>
      <p>During her performance, when she opened her artist-of-the-decade medley, she sang her feminist anthem <i>The Man</i>. She wore a white button-down shirt with titles of all her Big Machine-released albums.</p>
