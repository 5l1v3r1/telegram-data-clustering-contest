      <p>A teenager missing from Scotland may have travelled to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/cork">Cork</a> to visit family living there.</p>
      <p>Maraj Karimi - an Afghan teenager who has been missing for two months - is believed to have travelled from Scotland to Ireland to visit relatives.</p>
      <p>Scottish police are looking to trace the 15-year-old who has been missing from the Newton Stewart area of Dumfries and Galloway since the end of September, <a href="https://www.corkbeo.ie/news/police-think-missing-scots-teen-17309157">Cork Beo</a> reports.</p>
      <p>The 15-year-old is around 5ft 4in in height, of slim build and has short black hair.</p>
      <p>When last seen on September 22, he was wearing a pink/red and white polo shirt and a black bomber style jacket.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Scottish Police said: "We have been carrying out extensive enquiries and working with other law enforcement agencies to trace Maraj."</p>
      <p>"We believe he travelled to Belfast in Northern Ireland by ferry around 6am on 22 September and thereafter, potentially to the Dublin area via train."</p>
      <p>"We believe he has relatives in the Cork area and it's possible he may have travelled into the Republic of Ireland in order to reunite with his family."</p>
