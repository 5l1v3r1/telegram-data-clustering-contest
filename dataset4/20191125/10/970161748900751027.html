      <p>There’s even more bad news for Google’s Stadia service, with reports that the device needed to make it work on a TV is overheating.</p>
      <p>It’s not exactly been a smooth launch for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/google-stadia-uk-review-video-game-streaming-becomes-a-reality-11178888/">Stadia</a> so far, not so much because of any technical problems but simply a lack of interest and a lot of missing features.</p>
      <p>But it seems there may be a serious issue after all, as a number of users on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stadia/comments/dzd6v8/chromecast_ultra_overheating/">Reddit</a> are beginning to complain about the Chromecast Ultra media player dongle – which is needed to make Stadia work on a TV – overheating.</p>
      <p>In the worst cases this is allegedly leading to it shutting down, which apparently is a safety feature to ensure the Chromecast doesn’t burn out any internal components.</p>

      <p>That’s all very well but it also means people are having their play time limited to a few hours, and in some cases no more than 10 minutes.</p>

      <p>Although it could be a bad batch it’s not thought to be an intrinsic problem with the Chromecast Ultra, as they existed before Stadia and are often used as more general media players.</p>
      <p>It also doesn’t seem to make much sense given the whole point of streaming is that no processing is going on locally, so it’s not like a console that might get noisy or hot during a high-end game.</p>
      <p>Google have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stadia/comments/dzd6v8/chromecast_ultra_overheating/f89wqof/">responded to the issue</a> on Reddit but not only claim that the overheating isn’t a problem but deny that it’s causing shutdowns, which seems a bit pointless in a thread about shutdowns.</p>
      <p>We can’t say we noticed anything while playing it, but then we’ve been using a smartphone most of the time.</p>
      <p>It’s presumably to do with the high amount of data going backwards and forwards, which would be much more for a game than a movie, and it may mean Google have to redesign the Chromecast in the future.</p>
