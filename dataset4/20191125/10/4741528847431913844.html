      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:52:24+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nairametrics.com/author/samuel-bamidele/" target="_blank">Bamidele Samuel Adesoji</a></address>
      <p>Nigeria received $5.36 billion capital importation (inflows) in the third quarter (Q3) of 2019, compared to $5.82 billion in the second quarter (Q2). This is the lowest amount of capital importation received in the year.</p>
      <p>According to the latest<a href="http://nigerianstat.gov.ng/elibrary"> capital importation</a> report released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), $5.36 billion capital importation received in the third quarter represents a -7.78% contraction from the total amount ($5.82 billion) received within the second quarter (Q2). Meanwhile, year-on-year, capita inflows rose by 87.99%.</p>
      <h3>Capital Inflows by Type</h3>
      <p>Nigeria’s capital importation is categorized into three investment types, and these include Portfolio Investment, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Other Investment.</p>
      <p>In Q3 2019, the largest amount of capital importation by type was received through portfolio investment, which accounted for 55.88% ($2.99 billion) of total capital importation, followed by Other Investment, 40.39% ($2.16 billion) of total capital, and then Foreign Direct Investment, which accounted for 3.73% ($200.08 million ) of total inflows within the period.</p>
      <p><b>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): </b>FDI is an investment in the form of a controlling ownership in a business in one country by an entity based in another country. In the latest report, FDI constituted only 3.73% ($200.08 million) of total capital inflows in Q3 2019, this represents the lowest across all forms of capital inflows in the country.

      <h3>What this means for the Nigerian economy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The decline in capital importation in Q3 2019 means the amount of foreign capital that investors brought into the Nigerian economy between July and September 2019 dropped when compared to the amount in Q2 2019 (April and June).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, this does not necessarily imply a negative trend in the economy, due to the fact the on a year-on-year basis, capital importation into the economy improved significantly by 87.99%.</li>
        <li>This is further strengthened by the latest GDP data, which shows that the economy grew by 2.28% in real terms, in the third quarter of 2019, up from 1.81% growth recorded in the third quarter of 2018.</li>
        <li>As earlier published on <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2019/11/22/nigerias-gdp-grew-by-2-28-in-q3-2019-as-border-closure-hits-trade-sector/">Nairametrics</a>, expectations are high for the Nigerian economy as the World Bank’s 2.1% annual growth forecast for 2019 may eventually be surpassed.</li>
        <li>However, the latest capital importation report shows a worrying trend.</li>
        <li>For instance, the inflow of FDI into the economy dropped further, and this is not good for the economy. In Nigeria, FDI remains abysmally low.</li>
        <li>Analysts have stated that the low inflow of FDI is not good for the economy as other forms of capital importation has very low potential to drive the economy as FDI does.</li>
      </ul>
