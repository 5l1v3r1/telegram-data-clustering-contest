      <h1>BREAKING Uber stripped of licence to operate in London as TfL cracks down on taxi app</h1>
      <h2>Transport app Uber will lose its licence to operate in London at midnight tonight after Transport for London refused to renew or extend its existing one</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:01:46+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:01</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>Uber has been stripped of its London operating licence by Transport for London (TfL) this morning.</p>
      <p>The company's current licence runs out at 11.59pm tonight, after TfL extended it for just two months in September.</p>
      <p>When the last extension was awarded, a spokesman for TfL chair Sadiq Khan said private hire operators must fully comply with strict standards which keep Londoners safe.</p>
      <p>He added: "Sadiq has been crystal clear that in London it doesn't matter how powerful and how big you are, you must play by the rules."</p>
      <p>TfL refused to grant a full five-year licence over concerns about the company's approach to reporting serious criminal offences, how drivers' medical certificates were obtained, how criminal record checks were carried out and its use of technology which allegedly helped it evade law enforcement officials.</p>

      <p>It's not the first time TFL has <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uber-stripped-licence-london-not-11218517">stripped Uber of its licence</a> . Back in 2017, TfL concluded Uber was "not fit and proper to hold a private hire operator licence".</p>
      <p>The taxi firm appealed, and was eventually <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-uber-wins-fight-operate-12793482">granted a 15-month licence by a judge in June 2018</a> .</p>
      <p>There are around 45,000 Uber drivers in London.</p>
      <p>Uber said a range of new safety features have been introduced to its app in the past two years.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, it launched a system which automatically checks on the well-being of drivers and passengers when a journey is interrupted by a long stop.</p>
      <p>It also unveiled a discrimination reporting button on its app, and collaborated with the AA to produce a safety video to educate drivers on topics such as reading the road, speed, space management and how to drop off and pick up passengers safely.</p>
      <p>It is likely the firm will be allowed to continue operating while any appeals are pending.</p>
