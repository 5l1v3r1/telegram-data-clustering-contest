      <p>“Snow birds” is a term with which many of you are no doubt familiar. It is usually in reference to those people who are footloose and fancy-free, those people enjoying the golden years of their retirement by residing in the pleasant-weather northern portion of our country in the summer season and then retreating to southern climes when the winter season sets in.</p>
      <p>Please allow me to steer the discussion to a different kind of “snow bird” — those creatures that are actually covered with feathers.</p>
      <p>Along about now, I challenge you to keep an eye peeled for roadside hawks. You’ll see them perched on the tops of power poles as they scan the tall vegetation alongside the roads. These hawks do a smash-up job of preventing the world from getting overrun with pesky meadow mice.</p>
      <p>Ninety-nine point nine percent of these roadside hawks are going to have a white tummy. They are the all-to-familiar red-tailed hawks (although only the mature individuals sport the brick-colored tail feathers). My challenge is this: Keep a lookout for one of these hawks that is colored unlike the rest. If you are darn lucky, you are perchance to happen upon one color variation of the red-tailed hawk that is a beautiful chocolate brown color on its underside. I call it the “chocolate hawk” although straight-laced bird scientists would chastise me for taking liberties with the bird’s name.</p>
      <p>The “chocolate hawk” lives in Alaska. When the winter snows cover up the mouse diet of this bird, that is when this adorable hawk takes wing and becomes a “snow bird” — to spend the cold-weather months in central Oklahoma’s very hospitable clime.</p>
      <p>Good hunting!</p>
