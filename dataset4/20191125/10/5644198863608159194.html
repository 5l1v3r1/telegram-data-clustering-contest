      <p>LUXEMBOURG: A two-year-old boy was killed by a falling ice sculpture as families enjoyed holiday shopping at Luxembourg city's Christmas market.</p>
      <p>"The child was severely injured and died in the ambulance," police said, after Sunday (Nov 24) night's accident.</p>

      <p>An investigation has been opened, and on Monday the city - capital of the independent Grand Duchy - said all street markets would be closed for the day.</p>
      <p>"The sculpture couldn't have just fallen by itself," protested French sculptor Samuel Girault, who has been questioned by Luxembourg police.</p>
      <p>Girault told AFP he had 19 years experience in carving ice and the base of the fallen work weighed two tonnes.</p>
      <p>The accident happened just metres from the ice rink at the capital city's annual Christmas fair which opened on Thursday.</p>
