      <p>Manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pep-guardiola/"><b>Pep Guardiola</b></a> admits he is unlikely to move the Brazilian back into midfield because he has adapted to playing in the back four so well.</p>
      <p>With City light on central defenders after the departure of Vincent Kompany, the 34-year-old was pressed into emergency action at the back earlier this season due to injuries to Aymeric Laporte and John Stones.</p>

      <p>Stones returned to action last month but Fernandinho has remained at centre-back, partnering either the England international or Nicolas Otamendi.</p>
      <p>His ability in the role was evident on Saturday in a commanding display as City came from behind to beat Chelsea 2-1 in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>City were criticised after their loss at Liverpool a fortnight ago, with suggestions Fernandinho's presence was being missed in midfield, but Guardiola seems unlikely to change things.</p>
      <p>"If Rodri and (Ilkay) Gunodgan are fit, I don't think so," said the City boss. "I like Fernandinho in that position. With the problems we have I like it.</p>

      <p>"I know he can play (in midfield) but we have Gundogan, and I trust him a lot, and Rodri."</p>
      <p>Guardiola was impressed by Fernandinho at Anfield but feels he did not get the credit he deserved because of the result. The champions lost the top-of-the-table clash 3-1.</p>
      <p>A sarcastic Guardiola said: "If we lose he plays s***. I know that. In Anfield he was the best central defender we played there, in the back four. He played a disaster. I know how this job works.</p>
      <p>"But he was incredible in Anfield, he was incredible on Saturday."</p>

      <p>Expanding on the theme of criticism, Guardiola feels the team as a whole have been harshly treated over their performances this term.</p>
      <p>City, who clocked up a record 100 points in their 2018 title win and won a domestic treble last season, have lost three of their opening 13 Premier League games. They are third and trail leaders Liverpool by nine points.</p>
      <p>Guardiola said: "It looks like, if we won the last two Premier Leagues, we have to win seven Premier Leagues in a row and we have to make 200 points every season. It doesn't work in that way in the high, high level."</p>
      <p>After their achievements of the last two seasons, Guardiola does not think people should write off his side.</p>

      <p>He said: "We didn't give up last season and that's why we won again. Maybe we are going to lose (this season) but this team will never give up. This team tries.</p>
      <p>"If you believe (because of) the Norwich defeat and the other ones I am going to doubt my players, because they didn't try, you are wrong.</p>
      <p>"If you have doubts, last season we wouldn't have been able to do what we have done. After winning 100 points, winning four titles, that had never happened before. I see, every morning, my team and I don't have doubts."</p>
