        <b>Matiang'i's morning mission cut short</b>
      </p>
      <p>A Kenya Air Force helicopter carrying Interior CS Fred Matiang'i was on Monday morning forced to make a premature landing in Eldoret after bad weather made it impossible to reach the intended destination - Kapenguria.</p>
      <p>Matiang'i had planned to visit Kapenguria to supervise the rescue operation in a land slide accident which claimed at least 52 lives.</p>
      <p>The mission, however, proved impossible as the area was foggy with poor visibility, forcing the CS and his team to land in Eldoret.</p>
      <p>"<i>We have been forced to land here in Eldoret while we were on our way to Kapenguria where we hoped to meet the victims of the landslide. The weather is very bad and were forced after the pilots and the experts advised us to avoid the area. It is raining heavily and the visibility is poor,</i>" the Interior CS.</p>
      <p>He was accompanied by Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa, Rift Valley commissioner George Natembeya, among other high-ranking officials.</p>
      <p>"<i>We will wait here for the weather to clear and hopefully we will get on air and get to Kapenguria later. If it doesn't clear, we spend the night here and coordinate with the team on the ground but the National Government is working to help the victims of the landslide</i>," Matiang'i added.</p>
