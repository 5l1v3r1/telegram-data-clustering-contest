      <h1>Apple's Next iPhone Pro And Pro Max Should Be Juicier</h1>

      <p>Apple's iPhone 11 series was a well-needed upgrade for the lineup after it had lagged behind other flagship phones in terms of specs for some time. New reports suggest the iPhone 12 series will be even juicier.</p>
      <p>According to Barclays analysts, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/22/barclays-iphone-12-pro-likely-6gb-ram/">as reported by MacRumours</a>, the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max is set to come with 6GB of RAM, a rear-facing 3D sensing and mmWave support for higher-performance 5G.</p>
      <p>Of course, Apple doesn't ever release the RAM officially, but the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max were reported to come with <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/09/of-course-some-iphone-11-benchmarks-have-leaked/">4GB of RAM after some benchmarks</a> were leaked <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/14528580">on Geekbench</a>.</p>
      <p>While the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max look to be getting some important upgrades, the base iPhone 12 model will also reportedly be 5G-enabled and be fitted with 4GB RAM, like the iPhone 11.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the analysts also suggest an iPhone SE 2 is on the way in March 2020. It will supposedly look like the iPhone 8 and is expected to be released with a 4.7-inch display, Touch ID, 3GB RAM and an A13 chip.</p>
      <p>As for the iPhone 12 series, expect to hear more rumours in the lead up to September 2020. Given we're still a full 10 months out from that date, it seems likely a lot will change. [<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/22/barclays-iphone-12-pro-likely-6gb-ram/">Via MacRumors</a>]</p>
