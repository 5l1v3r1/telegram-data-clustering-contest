      <h1>West Ham United considering approach for Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/sheffield-united/"><b>Sheffield United</b></a> boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/chris-wilder/"><b>Chris Wilder</b></a> has reportedly emerged as a potential managerial target for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/west-ham-united/"><b>West Ham United</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>With the Hammers having suffered six defeats in an eight-match winless streak in all competitions, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/manuel-pellegrini/"><b>Manuel Pellegrini</b></a> is under pressure to keep his job at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>Should club officials decide to replace the Chilean, <i>The Mirror</i> says that an approach could be made for Wilder, whose Blades side currently sit in sixth place in the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">Premier League standings</a>.</p>
      <p>However, Wilder's close affinity to the Yorkshire outfit is likely to see him shun any offer to make the switch to east London at this stage of the season.</p>
      <p>The report adds that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/chris-hughton/"><b>Chris Hughton</b></a> is also an option, while the club may be prepared to make contact with former boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/david-moyes/"><b>David Moyes</b></a>.</p>
      <p>West Ham next face trips to Chelsea and Wolverhampton Wanderers, two clubs who sit in the top five in the table.</p>
