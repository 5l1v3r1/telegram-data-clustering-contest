      <h1>Dec Donnelly hits back as James Haskell ‘snaps’ at him during I'm A Celebrity live trial</h1>
      <h2>It seems he didn't think the trial was fair</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:07:52+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:07</time> by <a rel="author">Rebecca Carter</a></address>
      <p>James Haskell had a little pop at <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Dec Donnelly</a> during last night's live <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> trial.</p>
      <p>The campmates took part in the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/reality-tv/love-island/">Love Island</a> themed trial to try and win roast dinners for each of the stars.</p>
      <p>James and Roman Kemp took on the final challenge in which they had to lie in a bed filled with snakes.</p>

      </p>
      <p>They had to try and unscrew three stars in the blue boxes, which were on James' side and filled with a crab, spiders and cockroaches, and move it to the corresponding yellow box on Roman's side, which were also filled with critters.</p>
      <p>The pair had just 90 seconds to try and get the final three stars but didn't manage to complete the task.</p>
      <aside>How angry did James get? He had a little go at Dec.</aside>
      <p>James struggled with the first star as a crab was taking up most of the box and as he attempted to move it out of the way, Dec told him to be careful.</p>
      <p>After the challenge, Dec asked James: "That was unlucky. What was it James?"</p>
      <p>James hit back: "What was it? It was the very fact there was a giant crab in the way that you wanted me to carefully caress in a different direction as I tried to unscrew a star in its face."</p>

      <p>Dec said: "Alright someone's getting prickly!"</p>
      <p>The incident was also spoken about during last night's episode of spin-off programme Extra Camp.</p>
      <p>Host Emily Atack said: "How angry did James get? He had a little go at Dec."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, elsewhere in the live trial, Ian Wright left viewers in hysterics as <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-viewers-disgusted-over-ian-wrights-burping-during-live-trial/">he continuously burped and gagged after his challenge.</a></p>
      <p>He had to bury his head in a pie which contained slime and cockroaches, but it appeared to get too much for him and he couldn't stop belching.</p>
      <p>Later in the trial, Ian had to drink blended pig's penises to win a meal for camp but the beverage left him gagging.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Many viewers found Ian's antics amusing but others weren't impressed.</p>
      <p>One said on Twitter: "Can someone please turn off Ian’s mic because I can’t deal with the constant burping."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Who keeps burping on the live trial on #imacelebrity? It’s disgusting!" while a third added: "The worst part of this trial is Ian repeatedly burping, its making me feel sick."</p>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity continues tonight at 9pm on ITV.</p>
