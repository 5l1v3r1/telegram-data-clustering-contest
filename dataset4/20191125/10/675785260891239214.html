      <p>Livestock have been found slaughtered around the New Forest with occult symbols sprayed on their remains, raising fears their 'killers' are carrying out Satanic rituals.</p>
      <p>Locals in the Hampshire countryside fear the mysterious attacks, believed to have been carried out over a period of five days, were carried out by an occult-inspired group.</p>
      <p>Police are investigating after sheep and cattle were found killed and wounded, with their corpses sprayed with pentagram marks.</p>
      <p>The grisly finds have led locals in the quiet rural village of Bramshaw to fear a Satanic cult is roaming the area, after satanic symbols were daubed on a church, reports the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7717927/Terrified-residents-voice-concerns-Satanic-style-cult-roaming-national-park.html">Mail Online</a> .</p>

      <p>Two sheep and three cattle were found stabbed to death and marked with pentagrams, and a heifer was also injured in the spate of attacks around the New Forest national park.</p>
      <p>The number '666,' which is in Christianity believed to be the sign of the devil - was inscribed on Bramshaw's St Peter's Church.</p>
      <p>Judy Rudd, who has lived in the New Forest for 40 years, said she was walking her dogs when she came across a dead sheep.</p>
      <p>She said the animal had been stabbed to death, and its corpse had been sprayed with purple and green pentagram and cross symbols.</p>

      <p>Her husband Julian said he found it difficult to believe the killing was the work of teenagers messing around, calling the discovery "unnerving."</p>
      <p>"We've lived here 40 years and there's been nothing like this before," he told the Mail.</p>
      <p>"I don't agree that it's done to shock - you don't go around knifing animals simply to shock people. It's related to something other than simply a desire to injure animals. It's either witchcraft or whatever. It's rather worrying."</p>
      <p>St Peter's Church Reverend David Bacon also rejected theories the slaughters were the work of children, suggesting they could be a result of "witchcraft" or "black magic".</p>

      <p>He said the New Forest was known for attracting occult practitioners, but added that in all his 15 years in the town, he had never seen anything like it.</p>
      <p>"I've been told one of the symbols was a 666 which of course is a biblical sign of the devil, or Satan, so it could have [sinister overtones]."</p>
      <p>A Bradshaw farmer whose heifer survived being stabbed said he feared for the safety of the animals and people who frequent the forest, saying he feared more than one person was behind the slaughters.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Andy Williams, of Hampshire Constabulary, said the incidents were "unusual."</p>
      <p>He urged anyone in the New Forest area to be vigilant and contact the force if they saw anything suspicious.</p>
