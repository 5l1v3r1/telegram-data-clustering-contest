      <p>PARIS (Reuters) - Acquiring Tiffany will lift LVMH’s operating profits by 500 million to 600 million euros ($661.32 million) in the first 12 months, the luxury goods group’s Chairman and Chief Executive Bernard Arnault said on Monday.</p>
      <p>The $16.2 billion deal is expected to close mid next year, the companies said earlier.</p>
      <p>Arnault told Reuters that LVMH would finance the purchase with debt, adding the group could currently pay interest of less than 1% to issue bonds.</p>
      <p>LVMH would follow a similar pattern to its 2011 acquisition of Bulgari by investing in communication, stores and new products at Tiffany, Arnault said. He added that a management shake-up was not on the cards for now.</p>
      <p>“It’s a little early to decide on that, we have an excellent relationship with them,” Arnault said.</p>
