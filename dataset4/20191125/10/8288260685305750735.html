      <h2>Connal Trueman, who has come through the Blues academy, hopes to make the most of his latest Birmingham City chance - and revealed the advice given to him by Camp</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:08:19+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:08</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Dick, https://www.facebook.com/blueswriterbriandick/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Connal Trueman has described how Lee Camp helped him ahead of his first <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City </a>start in 15 months.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old was called into the team for the 1-1 draw with Huddersfield, replacing Camp who has struggled for form in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Trueman did well in what was his first appearance since his ordeal by set-piece at Tony Pulis’ Middlesbrough in August 2018.</p>
      <p>He made a couple of sharp saves in the first half and held firm in the second as the Terriers looked for another home win.</p>

      <p>“He’s a great guy Campy,” Trueman told BirminghamLive. “He’s been top class since he came to the club and he has helped me. I have learned a lot from him.</p>
      <p>“It could have been a difficult one for him on Saturday but he was first class in his approach and his attitude - especially with me - and I appreciate that a lot.</p>
      <p>“He said to relax and enjoy it, he said ‘You are good enough to play, relax, you deserve to be out there, go and do what you do’.</p>
      <p>“It would have been easy for him not to have been that way, it does mean a lot and says a lot about him as a character and a person and I really appreciate that.</p>

      <p>“He has been there and done it, I don’t know how many games and any words of advice he gives me I will always be ready to listen to.”</p>
      <p>Trueman is mindful of the fact Saturday’s chance is only a start, he will hope to retain his place against Garry Monk’s Sheffield Wednesday in a couple of days.</p>
      <p>If he does it will be a significant moment for Birmingham-born ‘keeper, against the manager who gave him his debut at the beginning of the 2018/2019 campaign.</p>
      <p>“I feel I have progressed a lot since Middlesbrough last season, obviously without playing the games I would have liked to.</p>
      <p>“When you work hard every day in training it gives you results and I feel I have come a long, long way from being around the group and part of the first team for that long you pick up things, it’s a great experience to learn from.</p>
      <p>“The nature of the position is there’s only one in the team, you know what you are getting into when you become a ‘keeper, it can be frustrating at times but it paid dividends and I am happy I have been given the opportunity.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t expect to be in that position, to start the season playing games was fantastic. When you are out of the team it’s the same as anyone else you want to be playing games.</p>

      <p>“I felt like I was working hard and showing myself in training and it didn’t come. But we were playing well, we had a good season last year.</p>
      <p>“Whenever you become a little bit frustrated you have to take stock and realise where you are, put a bit of perspective into things - and I did that.”</p>
      <p>That patience, which saw him sit-on the bench for the remaining 44 Championship matches last term both served him well and made Saturday’s recall all the more welcome.</p>
      <p>“My mom and dad were in the crowd, I was looking for them at the end but couldn’t find them. I am sure they were up there in the Blues fans cheering me on.</p>
      <p>“You can never look too far ahead, it’s only one game at a time.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully there are many years ahead of me, that’s why it was a little bit easier to be patient last year, you haven’t got to force things through necessarily, you can always be learning.” Particularly from such an experienced mentor.</p>
