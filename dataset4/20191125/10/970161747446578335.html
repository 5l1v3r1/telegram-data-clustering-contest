      <p>A lorry driver accused over the deaths of 39 migrants has admitted plotting to assist unlawful immigration.</p>
      <p>Maurice Robinson, 25, alleged to have been part of a global smuggling ring, is charged with the manslaughter of a group of men, women and children found dead in a refrigerated trailer.</p>
      <p>The bodies of eight females and 31 males were discovered in the container attached to his Scania cab in an industrial park in Grays, Essex, early on October 23.</p>
      <p>They were later identified as coming from various provinces of Vietnam, with the youngest being two boys aged 15.</p>
      <p>Robinson, who is known as Mo, appeared at the Old Bailey this morning where he admitted conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration between 1 May 2018 and 24 October 2019.</p>

      <p>He also admitted acquiring criminal property – namely cash – on the same dates.</p>
      <p>Robinson, from Craigavon in Northern Ireland, is yet to enter pleas to the remaining 39 counts of manslaughter along with offences of concealing criminal property and conspiracy to traffic people.</p>
      <p>The judge, Mr Justice Edis, said: ‘This is quite a significant investigation likely to involve investigations into other people.’</p>
      <p>Christopher Kennedy, 23, is due to appear at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court on Monday accused of human trafficking offences.</p>
      <p>He was arrested in the early hours of Friday morning on the M40.</p>
      <p>Kennedy, from Darkley in Co Armagh, is charged with conspiracy to arrange or facilitate the travel of people with a view to exploitation and conspiracy to facilitate the commission of a breach of UK immigration law.</p>
