      <p>The <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/10/10/truth-be-told-apple-tv-plus-trailer/">upcoming series</a> <b><i>Truth Be Told</i></b> for <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/apple-tv-6/">Apple TV+</a> gets its own featurette ahead of its debut in early December.</p>
      <p>Apple shared the featurette on its official Apple TV YouTube channel today. It comes in at just over three minutes in length, and, <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/20/apple-tv-plus-for-all-mankind-featurette/">like the other</a> behind-the-scenes videos we’ve seen for other Apple TV+ shows, we get to watch as members of the cast and crew introduce the new series.</p>
      <p>Here’s Apple’s description of the upcoming series:</p>
      <blockquote>When new evidence compels podcaster Poppy Parnell (Octavia Spencer) to reopen the murder case that made her a national sensation, she comes face to face with Warren Cave (Aaron Paul), the man she may have mistakenly helped to put behind bars. Her investigation navigates urgent concerns about privacy, media and race.</blockquote>
      <p><i>Truth Be Told</i> stars Octavia Spencer (<b><i>Hidden Figures</i></b>, <b><i>Ma</i></b>), Aaron Paul (<b><i>Breaking Bad</i></b>), Mekhi Phifer (<b><i>8 Mile</i></b>), Lizzy Caplan (<b><i>Castle Rock</i></b>, <b><i>Mean Girls</i></b>), Elizabeth Perkins (<b><i>Big</i></b>), and many others. The series was created by Nichelle Tramble Spellman.</p>
