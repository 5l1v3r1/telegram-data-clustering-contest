      <p>Vue Cinemas is facing a strong backlash from customers accusing them of ‘blatant racism’ <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/vue-accused-blatant-racism-banning-blue-story-machete-attack-11210857/">after pulling the movie Blue Story from its screens in response to a violent incident.</a></p>
      <p>The chain confirmed it would no longer be showing Rapman’s critically acclaimed film at any of its 91 outlets in the UK and Ireland <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/rapman-breaks-silence-birmingham-brawl-blue-story-banned-vue-cinemas-11211076/">after a fight broke out at the Star City complex in the Nechells area of Birmingham over the weekend.</a></p>
      <p>Police were called to the complex in Birmingham on Saturday evening following reports of youths with machetes, with the mass brawl resulting in a 13-year-old girl and four other teenagers being arrested, as well as seven officers being injured.</p>
      <p>A group of more than 100 people were said to be involved, with ‘pockets of fighting’ breaking out as families queued for Frozen 2.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson has since confirmed to metro.co.uk: ‘We can confirm a decision was made to remove the film. The safety and welfare of our customers and staff is always our first priority.</p>

      <p>‘We are saddened to have had to take this step, which is not made lightly, particularly as the film itself seeks to strike a strong message against violence.’</p>

      <p>A spokesperson for Odeon told metro.co.uk they would still be screening the film, saying in a statement: ‘We are aware of reports of violence at cinemas which have been linked to the film Blue Story. The safety of our guests and colleagues is our number one priority.</p>

      <p>Blue Story, a folllow-up to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/rapman-left-hometown-jealousy-releases-debut-feature-film-blue-story-11189779/">Rapman’s hugely successful YouTube series Shiro’s Story</a>, is about friends Timmy and Marco who become rivals in a vicious postcode war between South London’s Peckham and Deptford.</p>
      <p>The film’s cast includes Top Boy and The A List star Michael Ward as well as up and coming actor Stephen Odubola, Gold Digger’s Karla-Simone Spence and Khalu Best, who played Dexter Hartman in EastEnders.</p>
      <p>Rapman – real name Andrew Onwubolu – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/rapman-breaks-silence-birmingham-brawl-blue-story-banned-vue-cinemas-11211076/">has reacted to the brawl with a statement on Twitter,</a> saying: ‘Sending love to all those involved in yesterday’s violence at Star City in Birmingham. It’s truly unfortunate that a small group of people can ruin things for everybody.</p>
      <p>‘Bluestory is a film about love not violence.’</p>
      <p>He also referred to the ban, saying: ‘There were also a few incidents earlier this year with the release of The Joker, it’s always unfortunate, but I hope that the blame is placed with the individuals and not an indictment of the film itself.’</p>
      <p>‘I pray that we can all learn to live with love and treat each other with tolerance and respect.’</p>
