      <p>BEIJING (Nov 25): China, responding to allegations of interfering in Australian politics, said it had never tried to meddle in other countries' internal affairs and was not interested in doing so.</p>
      <p>Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang made the comment at a daily news briefing on Monday, adding that some Australian media outlets had fabricated allegations of interference.</p>
      <p>Some Australian politicians, organisations, and media have "become seized with imaginary fears" on issues related to China, Geng said.</p>
      <p>"They constantly fabricate cases of so-called Chinese spies infiltrating Australia."</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Australia's "60 Minutes" programme and affiliated newspapers said a suspected Chinese espionage ring had offered money to pay for a Melbourne luxury car dealer to run for a seat in Australia's federal parliament.</p>
      <p>The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation said it was investigating an alleged plot by China to install an agent in Australia's parliament.</p>
      <p>"However bizarre the story, lies are still lies in the end, whatever new guise they wear," said Geng.</p>
