      <p>Around 95% of adults in the country have Aadhaar and 90% of people trust their data is safe in the Aadhaar system, along with that 80% of the recipients feel Aadhaar has made government subsidies such as rations and pensions more reliable said a report released by Dalberg, a social impact advisory group. Funded by the Omidyar Network India, the report titled State of Aadhaar 2019 said that however, 90% of people incorrectly believe that providing the unique identity number is mandated by law for bank accounts and 33% of people who tried to update said the process was difficult. It also said the newer digital features of Aadhaar are yet to be embraced with close to 77% of Aadhaar holders have never used features such as <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/mAadhaar">mAadhaar</a>, QR code, virtual Aadhaar or masked Aadhaar.</p>
      <p>With Aadhaar being in its tenth year after the launch of the first unique identity number in Tembhli, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> in 2009, the report was launched to understand the usefulness of Aadhaar since the national household data has been thin on its usage so far.</p>
      <p>The report says that while 95% of people have aadhaar and use it on an average of once per month, 8% of people do not have Aadhaar which is an estimated 102 million people, and 75 million of whom are children.</p>
      <p>It also said that 30% of homeless and 27% of third-gender residents do not have Aadhaar. Also, 90% of residents in Assam and 61% of residents in Meghalaya do not have Aadhaar.</p>
      <p>The report said that improvements in on-the-ground processes related to Aadhaar can significantly enhance the lives of many residents in India. “The <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/social-safety-net">social safety net</a> could be appreciably strengthened for the nation’s most vulnerable groups—such as people who have low levels of education, are homeless, or identify as third gender—by offering additional support to those who need Aadhaar but cannot acquire it.” It added the Aadhaar updating process needs to be streamlined. “As more services are linked to Aadhaar, easy access as well as seamless updating and authentication will become only more critical.”</p>
      <p>While digital troubleshooting can be one of the options, it may not work for a a substantial share of the population which has low digital awareness.</p>
      <p>The study relied on insights from two national household surveys on Aadhaar, conducted between May and September 2019 and captured the experience of over 167,000 residents, which makes it the largest primary dataset on the use of Aadhaar.</p>
      <p>The report added that there is also potential for Aadhaar to support greater interstate integration and portability of welfare and other services. “This journey has already started; for example, PDS portability (enabled by Aadhaar authentication) is being implemented across state boundaries. As innovation and integration progress, states and union territories will have the opportunity to learn and adopt best practices from each other.”</p>
