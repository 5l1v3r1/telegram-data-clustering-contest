      <p>Earlier this year, Mamelodi Sundowns held a competition asking fans to create an updated version of the club's logo. Over the years, though, the Downs emblem has undergone slight changes as they grew in prominence. Check it out!</p>
      <p>In September, the Tshwane-based club announced that they would be refreshing their current logo, and subsequently left it up to fans to design a new one.</p>
      <p>Last month, Downs revealed the six finalists of the competition, with an announcement of the winning logo yet to be made. In fact, it was suspected that the updated logo had been leaked on social media, but the six finalists revealed suggest otherwise.</p>

      <p>That being said, the Sundowns logo has undergone a few changes throughout the 1990s before arriving at the one fans have become accustomed to over the past decade or so.</p>
      <p>In 1993, the logo drew strong comparisons to that of the Brazil national football team emblem, sporting a similar blue crest. Later on, Downs changed their logo to the circle and ribbon design, and have repeatedly tweaked it according to their kit designs.</p>
      <p>In recent years, fans have got used to the fact that Downs boast a star above their badge, signifying their status as a CAF Champions League winner.</p>
