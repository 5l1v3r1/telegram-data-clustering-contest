      <h1>Maryborough man Clint Chandler sold stolen goods on Facebook</h1>

      <p>A Maryborough man who burgled two properties and took thousands of dollars' worth of items, including a shotgun, was caught after advertising the stolen goods for sale on social media.</p>
      <p>Clint Chandler, 24, pleaded guilty in the County Court in Bendigo on Monday to two counts of burglary, two counts of theft and one count of theft of a firearm in relation to the crimes he committed in April this year.</p>
      <p>The court heard that between April 1 and April 19, Chandler entered two neighbouring properties at Moonlight Flat and Alma near Maryborough on at least three occasions.</p>
      <p>At the Moonlight Flat property he broke into sheds, a house and a portable and stole tools, machinery, antiques, collectibles, household items, ammunition and a single-barrel shotgun.</p>
      <p>These were worth about $1000.</p>
      <p>During this time he also stole from the Alma property such items as generators, pumps, hand tools, power tools and machinery, valued at about $2000.</p>
      <p>Chandler was caught after he advertised stolen items for sale on Facebook.</p>
      <p>The court heard he sold the shotgun for $150 to a friend, who then on-sold it.</p>
      <p>On April 30 police searched Chandler's home and he provided some of the stolen items to police.</p>
      <p>Chandler also gave them the PIN code to his phone, on which they found messages discussing the crimes.</p>
      <p>He made full admissions to his offending in his police interview.</p>
      <p>Defence counsel Robert Thyssen said Chandler's offending occurred during a period of separation from his long-term partner, a time in which he was also using the drug ice.</p>
      <p>The court heard he had no relevant criminal history and Mr Thyssen said his client's plea was one of genuine remorse.</p>
      <p>He said Chandler was also full and frank with police from the start, although Judge Paul Lacava pointed out he was "stuck between a rock and a hard place" when police showed up, having advertised the items on Facebook.</p>
      <p>"Pretty dumb," Judge Lacava said.</p>
      <p>Mr Thyssen asked the judge to consider a community corrections order for his client.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor David Cordy said that while Chandler had indicated an intention to plead guilty at the earliest opportunity, the offending warranted some period of imprisonment.</p>
      <p>He said properties like those Chandler targeted were vulnerable to such crime, which was a scourge on rural communities.</p>
      <p>The concern with the shotgun theft, Mr Cordy said, was that "these firearms get onto the black market, into the hands of criminals, and used in sinister offences".</p>
      <p>Chandler will be sentenced on Tuesday.</p>
