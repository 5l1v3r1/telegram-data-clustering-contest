      <p>Liverpool defender Andy Robertson has hailed teammate Sadio Mane for his vastly improved ability to finish chances.</p>
      <p>The Reds winger struck against Crystal Palace on Saturday during the club’s 2-1 win to take his tally to 12 for the season, and 29 for the calendar year.</p>
      <p>Mane’s sizzling form has seen him become the favourite for the 2019 African Player of the Year award, and he is also expected to finish high up in the Ballon d’Or standings.</p>

      <p>The Senegal international just seems to get better and better, and Robertson reckons his clinical finishing is a big reason as to why he is so dangerous.</p>
      <p>He said (<a href="https://www.goal.com/en-qa/news/mane-deserves-credit-as-one-of-the-best-in-the-world/1p8h68feh56ld10j0d4s7mk5wp">Goal</a>): “Even when I came to the club [in 2017] he was amazing but maybe did not have as much composure as he does now in front of goal. Now every time he is in front of goal you don’t think he will miss.</p>
      <p>“Does he belong in the top bracket? I would say so. People are giving him more credit and that is deserved.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Mane form crucial for Liverpool’s title bid</h3>
      <p>With Liverpool having kept just two clean sheets in the league so far, Mane’s goals have been massively important.</p>

      <p>Jurgen Klopp will need the winger to maintain his form throughout the season if the Reds are to stay ahead of the chasing pack.</p>
      <p>Seldom does £100,000-a-week Mane (<a href="https://www.spotrac.com/epl/liverpool-f.c/payroll/">Spotrac</a>) ever go through a dry spell for Liverpool, so there’s a good chance he’ll be popping up with more crucial goals to cancel out efforts from the opposition.</p>
