      <p>Realme’s next flagship will have 5G and the dual-lens selfie camera. The brand has teased its X50 smartphone on the <i>Sino Weibo</i> social media network in China and going by the teaser poster, the phone appears to have a punch-hole selfie camera.</p>
      <p>No further details have been provided by the brand, but it is clear that Realme is ready to ditch a pop-up selfie camera in favour of a dual pill-shaped punch-hole display featuring two selfie cameras. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/oneplus/">OnePlus</a> is another brand that is rumoured to drop the pop-up camera for a hole-punch display on the<a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/leaked-oneplus-8-pro-prototype-shows-dual-hole-punch-screen-quad-cameras-6113948/"> OnePlus 8 Pro</a>.</p>

      <p>While it’s the first time Realme will be offering a smartphone with a dual front-facing camera, but there are already phones available in the market that have two cameras on the front. Here is a list of smartphones that feature dual selfies cameras.</p>

      <h3>LG V40 ThinQ</h3>
      <p>LG V40 ThinQ, too, has two front-facing cameras on the front. The setup comprises of an 8MP regular shooter and a 5MP wide0-angle camera.

      <h3>Asus 6Z</h3>
      <p>Perhaps the highlight of the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/asus/">Asus</a> 6Z is its unique camera setup, which consists of two camera sensors. There’s a 48MP primary camera lens and a 13MP ultra-wide angle lens with a field of view of 126 degrees. Even though the cameras are on the backside, but since the phone has a mechanical camera module, they also serve as dual front cameras.

      <h3>Vivo V17 Pro</h3>
      <p>Vivo V17 Pro is another smartphone with a dual selfie camera. In fact, its the first phone with two pop-up selfie cameras. The single module contains two lenses, a 32MP wide-angle lens and an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens with a 105-degree field of view. The wide-angle lens is useful when taking a large group selfie, something that is impossible to capture using a regular lens.
