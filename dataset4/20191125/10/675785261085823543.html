      <h1>N'Golo Kante explains why he rejected PSG transfer interest to stay with Chelsea</h1>
      <h2>His performances, including helping France win the 2018 World Cup, has seen PSG show interest and they are expected to return with a big-money bid in the summer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:53:16+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:53</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>N'Golo Kante has revealed he has had several opportunities to join Paris Saint-Germain - but is fully committed to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a>.</p>
      <p>Kante spent three years starring in France before he arrived in the Premier League with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> for the 2015-16 season, winning an unlikely league title in his maiden season.</p>
      <p>A switch to Chelsea followed a year later, with the Frenchman helping the Blues romp to a league crown and he has become one of the finest midfielders in the English top-flight.</p>
      <p>And his performances, including helping France win the 2018 World Cup, has seen PSG show strong interest and they are expected to return with a big-money bid in the summer.</p>

      <p>But the likeable midfield maestro insists he is happy to remain in London - for now.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes we do not necessarily know where we want to go. But we know what we have. I know I was in Chelsea and I was good there," he told Canal Plus.</p>
      <p>"If I did not want to come to PSG it was more a sporting choice. I felt good in London, in the project and I was happy to stay there."</p>
      <p>Kante proved his undoubted ability by opening the scoring for Chelsea over the weekend, only for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> to mount a comeback win.</p>

      <p>The Blues had gone into the game above City in the table and they took an early lead through Kante before goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez won it for the hosts.</p>
      <p>And Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has admitted his side are probably exceeding expectations this term but has warned against complacency.</p>
      <p>The former Chelsea and England midfielder said: "It is hard to explain my expectation at the start of the season.</p>
      <p>"Until you have worked daily with the players, until you bring players who were playing in the Championship last season and younger players here, you don't know exactly how it is going to drop and how it ends up."</p>
