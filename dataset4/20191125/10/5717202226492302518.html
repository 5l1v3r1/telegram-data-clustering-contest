      <h1>Tony Cascarino tips Leicester striker Jamie Vardy to win PFA Player of the Year</h1>
      <h2>Vardy has scored in his last five matches and Leicester are flying.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:45:59+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>Tony Cascarino says Jamie Vardy is playing better than he did when Leicester won the Premier League and 2016, feeling he could win the PFA Player of the Year award.</p>
      <p>In the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/sport/weekend-talking-points-unai-emery-speaks-in-riddles-how-can-he-motivate-arsenal-team-ztmdrncpz">Times</a>, Cascarino raved over the Englishman who netted once again as Leicester saw off Brighton 2-0 at the Amex Stadium to stay second in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Cascarino <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/sport/weekend-talking-points-unai-emery-speaks-in-riddles-how-can-he-motivate-arsenal-team-ztmdrncpz">said</a>: “Graham Potter used the worse tactic you could ever implement against Jamie Vardy — three at the back with wing backs. I was amazed as soon as I saw the team sheet. What that gives a striker like Vardy is space. The wing backs push forward and the wider two of the three at the back inevitably push out a bit to cover more space.</p>
      <p>“That creates gaps around them and is inevitably a recipe for disaster against Vardy. I lost count of the number of times he got in those gaps. He’s playing even better than the year Leicester won the Premier League and if he carries on like this, I wouldn’t bet against him being player of the year.”</p>

      <h3>TBR’s View – Can Vardy get close to his consecutive scoring record?</h3>
      <p>Vardy hit goals in 11 straight Premier League games in 2015 and his rampant form now means that another such run cannot be put out of the question.</p>
      <p>If he does that, Leicester will have a fantastic chance of finishing in the top four and they are now the closest challengers to Liverpool as it stands.</p>
