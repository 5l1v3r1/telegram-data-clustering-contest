      <h1>India And Afghanistan Agree To Operationalise Treaty Facilitating Extradition Of Pakistani Terrorists To India</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:35:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:35</time> by <a rel="author">Swarajya Staff</a></address>
      <p>In an unprecedented development towards bolstering India's national security interests and elevating its ties with the nation of Afghanistan to an all-time heyday, the two nations have agreed to operationalise an extradition treaty enabling the extradition of Pakistani terrorists operating from Afghan territory to India, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/india-afghanistan-agree-to-extradite-pakistani-terrorists/articleshow/72213983.cms">reports </a><i>Economic Times.</i></p>
      <p>The development comes as a major blow to the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorists who are presently taken refuge in Afghanistan and are backed by the Army and the intelligence unit (ISI) of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that the aforementioned treaty was signed between the two nations back in 2016 when the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani was on a visit to meet Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi.</p>
      <p>The signing of the treaty is likely to ease the realisation of India's aspirations with respect to tightening the noose around terrorism emanating against it from the Pakistani soil and support.</p>
