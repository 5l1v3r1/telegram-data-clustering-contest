      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> stars James Haskell, Roman Kemp,Cliff Parisi and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele/">Adele</a> Roberts <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/im-celebrity-merged-love-island-not-sure-feel-11212117/">got stuck in to a grim </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/im-celebrity-merged-love-island-not-sure-feel-11212117/"> style trial.</a></p>
      <p>In Sunday’s episode the celebs were gathered around the fire pit, just like in the ITV2 dating show.</p>
      <p>But instead of deciding who to couple up with, the celebrities had 90 seconds to pass pig testicles to each other using only their mouths.</p>
      <p>The fact they were sat in a hot tub did little to make things any better as the foursome got stuck in.</p>
      <p>Luckily for us I’m A Celebrity have released high quality shots of the disgusting challenge, capturing the moment the stars grimace as a slippery, wet pig testicle gets handed off into their mouths.</p>
      <p>James wanted to make sure his target landed as he passed the ball to Roman – the pictures are quite something – while Cliff and Adele also gave it their best shot.</p>

      <p>Fair play to all the stars involved, this looked horrific.</p>

      <p>If that wasn’t enough for the campers, Andrew Maxwell had to drink a blended cockroach milkshake, and Caitlyn was put through the ringer again as she had to knock back a blended vomit fruit concoction.</p>
      <p>Ian Wright mean while was given a milkshake made of the other bit of the pig’s unmentionables in order to win his roast dinner. That was the slime and cockroaches pie, by the way.</p>

      <p>Even after watching all that, the Love Island recoupling ceremonies are still just a tiny little bit worse (they’re so tense!).</p>
      <p>Also in the episode, it was a bad day for James Haskell as he <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/declan-donnelly-hits-back-james-haskell-awkward-im-celebrity-clash-go-11213250/">snapped at Ant and Dec</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/im-celebrity-fans-side-kate-garraway-james-haskell-chivalry-clash-11213386/">clashed with Kate Garraway</a> about chivalry and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/im-celebrity-fans-demand-justice-james-haskell-roman-kemp-impossible-bushtucker-trial-11212111/">fell victim to a seemingly ‘impossible’ trial</a> with Roman Kemp.</p>
