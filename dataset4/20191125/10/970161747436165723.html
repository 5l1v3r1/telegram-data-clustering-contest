        <b>Chris Hemsworth was in high spirits as he arrives back home in Australia after a busy trip to Japan for Comic-Con.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Thor: Ragnorak actor threw up some peace signs as he walked through Sydney Airport wearing his best airport attire.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old donned a plain white T-shirt, jeans and a pair of grey sneakers and hid behind some dark sunglasses.</p>
      <p>He didn’t mind stopping for photos with eager fans because Thor is the politest superhero.</p>
      <p>Chris enjoyed an extremely short trip to Tokyo for Comic-Con, where he hit the stage with Thor’s hammers.</p>
      <p>Not like anyone else can pick it up, right? Oh wait…</p>
      <p>The star was obviously there for business, promoting the latest Thor instalment, Thor: Love and Thunder, which has Natalie Portman and Tessa Thompson as his co-stars.</p>

      <p>We can’t wait to see muscly Thor make a comeback after his potbelly incident in Avengers: Endgame.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The newest movie will start filming in Sydney in August next year, with the movie set to be released in November 2021.</p>
      <p>It was also revealed that Natalie will be playing the first female Thor, and we’re guessing Thor is going to get a little jealous.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Avengers: Endgame writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have opened up about avoiding a ‘bloodbath’ and allowing Thor to live.</p>
      <p>Well, someone had to.</p>
      <p>After we tragically lost heroes including Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), a tiny ray of hope was presented to mourning Marvel fans in the form of the survival of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) among others.</p>
      <p>Chatting about the surviving Avengers, Stephen explained: ‘We could have had a bloodbath and all six of them gone down swinging, but that seemed even more depressing.’</p>
      <p>Um, no thank you.</p>
      <p>Chatting about the surviving duo, he added: ‘It’s not necessarily that we knew they’d get more stories, it’s just that…Thor has sacrificed and sacrificed and lost and lost.</p>
      <p>‘It’s not a good ending to kill him. To have him finally, reasonably content with himself—and with his current weight, by the way [is more satisfying].’</p>
