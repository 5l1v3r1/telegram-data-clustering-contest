      <h3>JUSTICE Secretary Menardo Guevarra yesterday turned down his nomination as associate justice of the Supreme Court.</h3>
      <p>“I found out it was good, it was exciting, so (former Sandiganbayan) Justice (Raoul) Victorino thank you for nominating me but I’m still in love with the DOJ (Department of Justice), “ Guevarra said in a speech before members of the Prosecutors League of the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Guevarra was proposed by Victorino to the Judicial and Bar Council as replacement for Chief Diosdado Peralta as associate justice.</p>
      <p>“I believe that he possesses the necessary credentials, professional experience and the motivation to discharge the duties as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court,” Victorino’s letter to the JBC read in part.</p>
      <p>The JBC is the constitutionally-mandated body to screen and vet nominees to key positions in the judiciary and the Office of the Ombudsman.</p>
      <p>Under the 1987 Constitution, President Duterte has 90 days from Peralta’s appointment within which to appoint his replacement.</p>
      <p>But Guevarra admitted that in 2016, he considered applying to the high court, saying that “it is one of my career options.” </p>
      <p>“Do you know the feeling of someone who has always desired a wonderful person to be his or her spouse in the future? But somewhere along the way, he bumps into someone else whom he likes and desires,” Guevarra said.</p>
