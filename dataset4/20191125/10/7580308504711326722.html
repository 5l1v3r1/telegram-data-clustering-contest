      <p>Nigeria’s communications and digital economy minister Isa Pantami on Monday alleged that some corrupt individuals have concluded plans to use the media to sabotage the efforts of the Nigerian government to stop exploitation in the sector.</p>
      <p>“This is to notify the general public that the Office of the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy (Isa Pantami), is not unaware of the clandestine attempts of some unpatriotic elements at sabotaging the efforts being made by the ministry to deliver its mandate to Nigerians,” Pantami’s spokesman Uwa Suleiman said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Since assumption of office, the Honourable Minister has consistently rolled out some policies that strive to protect the consumer and entrench discipline and professionalism in the sector, this stand has obviously ruffled some feathers whose sole aim is to discredit Dr Pantami’s mass-friendly policies.”</p>
      <p>Suleiman disclosed that government investigations have exposed the planned activities by corrupt persons to smear Pantami and his policies because they no longer conduct business as usual for corrupt elements.</p>
      <p>Pantami’s spokesman said the corrupt individuals have strategised to induce the media with some monies to compromise against the minister.</p>
      <p>He said the sole aim of the ‘facade’ is to intimidate the minister into allowing the continued exploitation of Nigerians in the communication sector which he will not bow to.</p>
      <p>“No acts of corruption or injustice shall be condoned,” Suleiman said.</p>
      <p>He said the minister and the ministry remains focused on delivery on the key mandates of Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari.</p>
      <p>Suleiman called on media organisations to shun such plots and uphold the integrity and character of their profession.</p>
      <p>He urged Nigerians to be alert and disregard any information that contradicts the policies of the ministry.</p>
