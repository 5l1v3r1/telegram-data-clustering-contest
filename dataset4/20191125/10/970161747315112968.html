      <p>It’s almost time to get your home looking festive. Which means dragging the dusty old box of decorations out of the attic.</p>
      <p>And it wouldn’t be Christmas if you didn’t spend the first three hours of decorating untangling your Christmas lights, until you’re almost driven mad.</p>
      <p>Luckily, one woman has devised a super useful, time-saving hack which will mean you’ll never have to lose your mind unravelling those pesky cables again.</p>
      <p>It couldn’t be simpler.</p>
      <p>Chelsea young uses an empty cardboard toilet roll to prevent her Christmas tree lights from tangling up every year.</p>

      <p>The 21-year-old says she loves setting up her Christmas tree, but hates untangling jumbled up fairy lights so much that she would often buy new ones because of it.</p>
      <p>But, Chelsea, who’s a mum-of-two, made the connection that her headphones never get tangled because she had always wrapped them around her mobile – so she thought to try to do the same with her Christmas lights.</p>

      <p>Last year, she found an empty cardboard toilet roll and wrapped her lights around it before putting the whole thing safely away in storage.</p>
      <p>This year, she unpacked her old Christmas lights to found they were good as new, and she was able to easily unroll them around the tree – tangle-free.</p>
      <p>‘I got fed up with spending time untangling lights when I just want to get the tree decorated stress free so it’s enjoyable,’ says Chelsea.</p>
      <p>‘Sometimes you accept defeat and go buy more and the cost will mount up in time.</p>

      <p>‘I used to wrap my headphones around my phone and they’d never tangle so I thought I’d give the empty kitchen roll a go and if it works then great and if not try something else the following year.</p>
      <p>‘I saved myself at least an hour or two untangling them.</p>
      <p>‘Trying to do that alongside two small children who have me running back and forth keeping them entertained whilst I get it done can be time consuming.’</p>
      <p>Chelsea shared another tip for making the decorating process as stress-free as possible.</p>
      <p>She suggested wrapping your Christmas tree with cling film with the fairy lights still attached, and simply unwrapping it the following year – saving time and effort of having to reassemble the decorations.</p>

      <p>Chelsea added: ‘Saves the fuss and time of trying to wrap and unwrap them round the tree each year.’</p>
      <p>We are definitely trying this one.</p>
