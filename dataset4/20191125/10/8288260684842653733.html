      </p>
      <p>Electorate: 77,354 [2010 figure]</p>
      <p>Voted Leave</p>
      <p>Turn-out [in 2017] - 73. 4 per cent</p>
      <p>Conservative held - Majority of 20,571.</p>
      <p>Candidates confirmed: Ade Adeyemo [Lib Dem], Julian Knight [Conservative], Rosemary Sexton [Green], Nick Stephens [Labour]. The Brexit Party announced it was not standing in seats the Tories won in 2017.</p>
      <p>History:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The seat has been sending MPs to Parliament since 1945 - the year that Labour won a shock landslide against Winston Churchill's Conservatives. Labour's candidate was one Roy Jenkins, later a Home Secretary and later still a founder member of the breakaway Social Democratic Party (SDP).</li>
        <li>The man who beat Mr Jenkins to become the constituency's first MP was Sir Martin Lindsay - a former explorer who had been on expeditions to the Arctic and the rainforests of the Congo.</li>
        <li>The seat has been Conservative-held for all but ten of its 74 years and at one time was considered among the party's safest in Britain.</li>
        <li>In 2005, the seat saw the biggest shock in its history, when Liberal Democrat Lorely Burt snatched it from Tory incumbent John Taylor. Five years later she successfully held it with a wafer-thin majority of 175 votes - making it one of the most marginal battlegrounds in the country.</li>
        <li>When the Lib Dem vote collapsed in 2015, Mrs Burt failed to secure a third term, losing to Conservative Julian Knight. Two years later he extended his majority to more than 20,000 - the greatest buffer the Tories had had for 25 years.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Profile:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Solihull is home to many of the Midlands' most affluent residents and is mostly made up of leafy suburbs. Although it is often forgotten that there are pockets of deprivation in the likes of Elmdon and Lyndon.</li>
        <li>Smaller and more densely populated than neighbouring Meriden, it is made up of eight council wards. These range from Conservative bedrocks like St Alphege, which includes the town centre, to the three Shirleys - which can be key to a party's fortunes. Those wards closest to the Coventry Road have a strong Lib Dem presence.</li>
        <li>The constituency is home to one of the region's single biggest employers, Jaguar Land Rover.</li>
        <li>It is about as far from the sea as you can possibly get in our island. It does however have Olton Mere - a striking sight on maps - and is threaded with both canals and rivers.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Key issues:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Expect Brexit to get a mention or two, particularly in relation to companies like the aforementioned Jaguar Land Rover. Solihull did vote to Leave, although the majority was not as large as in, for example, parts of the Black Country.</li>
        <li>Housing is a key issue in all parts of the country and affordability is a particular worry in places like Solihull. As a desirable place to live, property prices are pushed up, making it hard for first-time buyers and those who have grown up in the area and are keen to stay.</li>
        <li>The seat is the centre of Solihull's public sector, containing the hospital, council house and police station. Pressures on budgets have dominated local debate for a while; West Midlands Police's current base, on Homer Road, is due to shut next year and school funding is a key issue.</li>
        <li>The environment has been shooting up many voters' list of priorities and the abundance of litter picking and park support groups locally shows the keen interest many take in looking after open spaces. Issues like air quality, global warming and public transport could carry significant weight.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Electorate: 83,428 [2010 figure]</p>
      <p>Voted Leave</p>
      <p>Turn-out [in 2017]:  67.6 per cent</p>
      <p>Conservative held - Majority of 19,198</p>
      <p>Candidates confirmed: Teresa Beddis [Labour] Saqib Bhatti [Conservative], Steve Caudwell [Green], Laura McCarthy [Lib Dem]. The Brexit Party announced it was not standing in seats the Tories won in 2017</p>
      <p>History:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Meriden was created in 1955 and for the first 25 years see-sawed between the Conservatives and Labour; at this time it had included mining communities in Warwickshire. However, boundary changes in 1983 helped cement the Tory hold and it has been blue ever since.</li>
        <li>Two of its MPs have died in office, with the first prompting a by-election in 1968. When incumbent Iain Mills passed away in early 1997, there was a vacancy for several months given that a General Election was on the horizon.</li>
        <li>That year saw Caroline Spelman become the constituency's first female Member of Parliament. Her majority then was a very slender 582, but it had grown to more than 19,000 at the last contest two years ago.</li>
        <li>The former cabinet minister has been the seat's longest-serving representative but announced in September she would be stepping down. Confirming she would not stand again, Dame Caroline said she had received significant abuse in recent times.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Profile:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This is the single largest seat in the West Midlands, covering a vast geographic area, although it takes its name from one of the constituency's smaller villages - the historic heart of England.</li>
        <li>It comprises nine council wards. The Conservatives have a firm grip on the more rural neighbourhoods, but the north of the borough is dominated by the Green Party and Labour.</li>
        <li>Such a sprawling area inevitably covers a wide range of communities and there is often concern about the dramatic levels of inequality; many of the villages are incredibly affluent, while the housing estates to the north contain considerable deprivation.</li>
        <li>Meriden is home to some of the crown jewels of the region's economy, not least the Airport and NEC. Although there is always a tussle to convince visitors from further afield they are not, in actual fact, in Birmingham.</li>
      </ul>

        <figcaption>HS2 will have a huge impact on the constituency. (Image: PA)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Key issues:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The HS2 construction project looks set to dominate debate for several years - the line cuts up through three wards [Chelmsley Wood, Bickenhill and Meriden] and a new interchange station will be built near the NEC. A leaked draft of a review into the project recommends the scheme goes ahead, but a final verdict is due after the election.</li>
        <li>Other major construction projects on the horizon include an upgrade of the M42 Junction 6, plans for a garden village - near the new station - and other substantial housing estates. Protecting green belt land - especially in the Meriden Gap - always looms large in any election campaign.</li>
        <li>Elsewhere a number of areas are keen to see investment. Delays over the Kingshurst Parade redevelopment have frustrated residents, while there are increasing calls to breathe new life into village centres such as Balsall Common and Knowle.</li>
        <li>Even in a national contest in which referendums, trade deals and the like are likely to weigh heavily, never underestimate local issues. For example, in both the poorest and best-off parts of the seat there has been much anger in recent years about the standard of bus services.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
