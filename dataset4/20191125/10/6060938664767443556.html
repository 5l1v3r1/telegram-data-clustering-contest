      <p>Priyanka Chopra, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Katrina-Kaif">Katrina Kaif</a> might not be doing any films together but the actress shares a great bond off-screen. There are a very few contemporary actresses in B-town who get along with each other very well, PeeCee and Katrina are few of them. Despite the '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/India">Bharat</a>' hullabaloo, the two actresses were seen gelling well at the recently held Bollywood party.</p>
      <p>'Sooryavanshi' actress, Katrina Kaif took to her Instagram handle to update her fans with this rare union picture. She shared this happy picture of Priyanka and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Salman-Khan">Salman Khan</a>'s sister <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Arpita">Arpita</a> with her. In the picture, Priyanka is looking extremely gorgeous as always while Katrina looked pretty in her black attire. Arpita who is pregnant now is also seen in a happy mood as she poses with the actress.</p>
      <p>While Katrina shares good chemistry with Salman, Priyanka too has no hard feelings for Bhai. In fact, she was the one who met Salman Khan at his house post their Mumbai reception. Now, with this picture, it seems all is well with PeeCee and Katrina as well.</p>
      <p>On the work front, PeeCee is currently shooting for a digital content film in Mumbai, while Katrina is gearing up for her next release 'Sooryavanshi'.</p>
