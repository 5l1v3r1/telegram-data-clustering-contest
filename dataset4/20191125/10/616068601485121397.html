      <p>West Kelowna will benefit from 26 transition beds and 30 units of second-stage housing for women and children leaving violence.</p>
      <p>The Kelowna Women's Shelter will operate the spaces, part of 260 new spaces of transition, second-stage and affordable housing announced by the provincial government, Monday, in 11 buildings across B.C.</p>
      <p>The announcement kicks off "16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence."</p>
      <p>"It's encouraging to see communities and partners around the province working together to ensure that women and children have safe and secure places to go when they need help," said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. "Everyone deserves to live a life free of violence with hope for the future, and we are working hard to create more homes and opportunities for women and children to thrive."</p>
      <p>Combined with a first round of projects announced in 2018, more than 600 new homes are open or in progress.</p>
      <p>The homes will be operated by non-profit providers that specialize in housing and supports for women and children who are experiencing or at risk of violence.</p>
      <p>In addition to funding construction, the province will provide funding for support services including emotional support, safety planning and information and referrals to medical, legal and financial assistance.</p>
      <p>The projects are part of a 10-year, $734-million investment to build 1,500 safe homes with supports for women and children leaving violence. It's anticipated the funding will increase the number of transition homes by 63%.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Women's transition houses are staffed 24/7 and provide safe, short-term shelter and supports (typically for 30 days) for women and children fleeing violence.</li>
        <li>Safe homes provide safe, short-term shelter and supports (typically for 10 days) for women and children fleeing violence in rural and remote communities.</li>
        <li>Second-stage housing provides safe, short-term housing and supports for women after they leave an abusive relationship or situation. Women can stay for six to 18 months while they prepare for independent living.</li>
      </ul>
