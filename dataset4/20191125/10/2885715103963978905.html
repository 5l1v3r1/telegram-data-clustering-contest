      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:44:30+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Former limited-overs captain George Bailey is set to be Australia’s new selector after he was picked to be a part of the national selection panel along side coach Justin Langer and chairman Trevor Hohns.</p>
      <p>Bailey, 37, is still an active cricketer and plies his trade in the Big Bash League for Hobart Hurricanes and in the Sheffield Shield for Tasmania.</p>
      <p>According to a report in ‘The Sydney Morning Herald’ and ‘The Age’, Bailey will not be the first active cricketer to be a national selector.</p>
      <p>In the past Don Bradman and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/michael-clarke/">Michael Clarke</a> have enjoyed the post while still being the captain of the national team.</p>
      <p>Bailey, who has represented Australia in five Tests, 90 ODIs and 30 T20s, is yet to call it quits from the game.</p>
      <p>Asked about the necessity of a new selector, Cricket Australia head of national teams Ben Oliver said he was “really pleased with the people who put their hat in the ring for that role”.</p>
      <p>“There will be some people who are really disappointed no doubt but they should all take great encouragement and they all have a lot to offer,” he said.</p>
      <p>Although it is believed that CA is showing keen interest in Bailey because of his vast knowledge of the white-ball formats as a player, especially with next year’s Twenty20 World Cup at home round the corner, Oliver said the new selector would also be involved in selecting squads for Test matches.</p>
      <p>“The panel, and all three, will be responsible for all Australian men’s teams,” Oliver said.</p>
      <p>“What we’ve tried to achieve in this recruitment process is adding in some complementary skills to support Trevor and Justin and one of those is a consideration around short-format cricket.”</p>
