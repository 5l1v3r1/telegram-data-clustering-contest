      <h3>Here's all the action you missed over the last few days of I'm A Celeb.</h3>
      <p>Your votes sent Jacqueline down to Ol' Dingo Town to enter the Snake Hotel - and she chooses Myles to join her. While the Rak-Su star finds himself banished to a trunk full of snakes, Jacqueline is left to make her way through the hotel alone... almost. But dozens of sneaky snakes don't stop her finding all the stars - and the keys to free Myles.</p>

      <p>Jacqueline and Myles enter the Jungle Jailhouse much to the delight of their fellow Outlaws. The news doesn't go down so well back at Main Camp - especially when they find out the pair have chosen to feed the Outlaws with their Bushtucker stars, leaving the remaining Celebs with rice and beans for dinner.</p>

      <p>James and Caitlyn put their heads together in a bid to rob a bank - and bail out one of the Jungle Outlaws. It's a calamity caper as the pair encounter spiders, green ants, some head-scratching puzzles and a difficult language barrier before they finally secure their Dingo Dollars!</p>

      <p>The Campmates slip into the Bush Telegraph to secretly vote for the first official Camp leader. Kate and Adele both prove popular choices, but it's James who steals the show to take his place on the Camp throne.</p>

      <p>Life in the Jungle is tough when you're tired, hungry and miles away from loved ones. As he admires James and Jacqueline's new digs, Andrew breaks down in front of the pair, who offer him some kind words of encouragement to keep him going.</p>

      <p>After a big Bushtucker Trial and a few emotional moments, the Celebs are given their luxury items at the end of a long day to celebrate being a united Camp of 12 for the very first time. There's a few more tears, some amazing moves and a whole load of hugs - awwww!</p>

      <p>There's a big job to be done at the Pest Office to free the remaining Jungle Outlaws. It's cow's eyes for lunch for James and Caitlyn, before Nadine and Adele are tasked to eat cow's anus while the rest of the Celebs looked on... or look away.</p>

      <p>A huge Trial with some big consequences is in store for our Campmates, and the task of having to rank themselves causes some tension before bedtime. Kate and James disagree on whether the ladies should get priority, while Andrew snaps at Ian and the pair have some tense words.</p>

      <p>Andrew, Caitlyn and Ian have to down a cocktail of blended cockroaches, pig's penis in a bid to win three stars for Camp in the Live Trial. It's probably best not to watch this before dinner...</p>
