      <h1>Derbyshire town boasts top state school in East Midlands</h1>
      <h2>Two other Derbyshire schools have also been ranked highly</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:35:02+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:35</time> by <a rel="author">Zena Hawley</a></address>
      <p>A Derbyshire school has been named as the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/education">top state secondary school</a> in the East Midlands by a national newspaper education guide.</p>
      <p>Although the school did not come top in the region for its exam results, the people compiling Parent Power, The Sunday Times Guide 2020, judged Queen Elizabeth’s Grammar School in <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/ashbourne">Ashbourne</a> as deserving of the accolade.</p>
      <p>A Parent Power spokesman said: “Each school is ranked nationally and the tables list where they sit for the region.</p>
      <p>“The Sunday Times Parent Power winners are chosen by the team who put the guide together. They may not be ranked highest in the region however other factors such as how it performed against last year are taken into consideration.”</p>
      <p>The school was fifth in the region but it is the first time it has been in the top 10, according to head teacher Scott Garrity.</p>
      <p>This year’s A level exam results saw 70.5% of exams achieve grades A* to B and 27.7% of GCSE grades were 9 to 7, equivalent to the former A and A* grades.</p>

      <p>Mr Garrity said: “We are so proud and honoured to be recognised in this prestigious national publication of the 2000 highest achieving schools in the country.</p>
      <p>“To be awarded the East Midlands state school winner for 2019 is testament to everything our staff and students believe in and work hard to achieve. Whilst we are proud of our top grades, we are proud of all of our grades and the holistic approach to the education we offer.</p>
      <p>“At QEGS, we value education in the broadest sense, with sports, the arts, enterprise, performance, employability skills, competition, cultural school visits and many other amazing opportunities taking equal standing with academic success.</p>
      <p>“I am proud and privileged to be the head teacher of such a successful and supportive educational community with a long-standing and fantastic heritage.”</p>
      <p>The rankings in the secondary school league tables are determined by the percentage of examination entries gaining A* to B grades at A-level this summer (which is given double weighting) and the percentage of entries returning A* and A grades, and those graded 9, 8 and 7, at GCSE and iGCSE.</p>
      <p>They are published several weeks ahead of the official Government tables for secondary school performance.</p>
      <p>In the top ten table for independent schools in the East Midlands, Derby High School and Repton School came seventh and ninth respectively.</p>
