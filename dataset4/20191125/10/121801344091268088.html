      <p>Stacey Abrams is getting into television.</p>

      <p>Abrams has written eight novels under the Selena Montgomery pen name. <i>Never Tell</i> was first published in 2004. </p>
      <p>Raggs, whose credits also include <i>The Originals</i> and <i>Switched at Birth</i>, will executive produce the project with Abrams and PatMa principals Nina Tassler (a former president of CBS Entertainment) and Denise Di Novi.</p>
      <p><i>Never Tell </i>joins a drama development slate at CBS that includes David E. Kelley's adaptation of Michael Connelly's <i>The Lincoln Lawyer</i>, which has a series production commitment; a reboot of <i>The Equalizer,</i> starring and exec produced by Queen Latifah; Dolph Lundgren starrer <i>The International</i>, executive produced by Sylvester Stallone; and crime procedural <i>Bent</i>, from <i>Star Trek: Discovery</i> co-EP Vaun Wilmott.</p>
