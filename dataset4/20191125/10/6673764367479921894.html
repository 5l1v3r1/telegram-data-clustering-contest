      <p><b>HOUSTON – </b>Dallas coach Rick Carlisle didn’t want his team to get overexcited about its convincing victory over the Houston Rockets on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He was, however, quick to note the importance of it.</p>
      <p>“This is a big win. There’s no question about that,” Carlisle said. “You come in here, this is a big-time place to play and you’re playing against great players. So our guys deserve credit but this is a process and it’s day by day and week by week and we’ve got to continue to go for daily improvement.”</p>
      <p>Luka Doncic scored 41 points, Tim Hardaway Jr. added a season-high 31 and the Mavericks never trailed in the 137-123 romp.</p>
      <p>The Mavericks scored 45 points in the first quarter and were up 78-60 at halftime. Hardaway had 19 in the half, Doncic 17 and Kristaps Porzingis 15.</p>
      <p>“That first quarter killed us,” Houston’s P.J. Tucker said.</p>
      <p>James Harden was asked what Houston did wrong defensively.</p>
      <p>“Everything,” he said. “We allowed them to do whatever they wanted to do from the beginning of the game and when you give a team like that comfort . . . they gain confidence. And that’s what they did.”</p>
      <p>The Mavericks has won five straight, scoring at least 137 in the last three. Houston has lost three straight after winning eight in a row.</p>
      <p>Dallas knew that the Rockets had a quick turnaround after playing a game in Los Angeles on Friday night and focused on getting off to a good start.</p>
      <p>“It was important,” Hardaway said. “We wanted to make sure we came out of the gate with some firepower, some energy.”</p>
      <p>The Mavericks got a dunk from Dwight Powell to push the lead to 11 early in the fourth quarter. Houston used a 6-0 run after that shot to get to 110-105 with 9 minutes to go.</p>
      <p>Doncic ended the run with a jump shot, but Russell Westbrook added a basket seconds later to cut it to five again.</p>
      <p>Dallas was still up by 5 later in the quarter before scoring the next five points, with a dunk from Hardaway, to make it 119-109 midway through period, and Houston didn’t get close again.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kings 113, Wizards 106</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Washington, Rui Hachimura was held to seven points on 2-of-7 shooting and grabbed four rebounds as the Wizards missed out on their third straight win.</p>
      <p>Harrison Barnes matched his season high with 26 points for Sacramento and Bojan Bogdanovic had 21.</p>
      <p>Buddy Hield added 18 points, including a late 3-pointer that helped put the Kings ahead to stay.</p>
      <p>Sacramento won for the seventh time in 10 games to improve to 7-8. Washington is 5-9.</p>
      <p>Bradley Beal led Washington with 20 points, ending his string of 30 or more at a career-best five games.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Clippers 134, Pelicans 109</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Los Angeles, Montrezl Harrell tied a career-high with 34 points and had 12 rebounds, Kawhi Leonard added 26 points and the Clippers won their fifth straight.</p>
      <p>Lou Williams added 19 points and Paul George had 18. The Clippers had 16 3-pointers with George making six.</p>
      <p>Brandon Ingram, one of three Lakers players involved in the Anthony Davis trade, led New Orleans with 24 points and eight rebounds in his first game back at Staples Center.</p>
