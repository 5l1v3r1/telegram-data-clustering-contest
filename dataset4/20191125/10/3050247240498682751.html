      <h1>Google Searches for Bitcoin Spike After BTC Price Hits 6-Month Lows</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:32:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:32</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) has sparked fresh interest from mainstream consumers after its price nosedived to its lowest levels since May this week. </p>
      <p>According to data from <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&amp;q=bitcoin">Google Trends</a>, “Bitcoin” and associated terms have increased in popularity conspicuously over the past week.</p>
      <h3>“Bitcoin halving” back in the spotlight</h3>
      <p>Currently, “Bitcoin” is at its highest search ranking since late October, when BTC/USD traded at close to $10,000.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Geographically, interest appears to be coming from Africa, with Nigeria, South Africa and Ghana forming the top three sources. Austria and Switzerland complete the top five.</p>
      <p>Attention is also focusing on factors beyond the Bitcoin price — the term “<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=bitcoin%20halving">Bitcoin halving</a>” is likewise in the spotlight once again since its October highs.</p>
      <p>The event, scheduled for May 2020, is widely considered as a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-most-dramatic-2020-halving-could-cut-supply-by-63m-a-week">catalyst</a> for markets, with multiple analysts predicting a new parabolic bullish phase beginning after or just before the halving.</p>
      <h3>Price volatility predicted to endure</h3>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/worldwide-google-searches-for-bitcoin-hit-3-month-high">reported</a>, price movements often dictate mainstream interest in Bitcoin, with volatility tending to see more press coverage outside <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrency</a> circles.</p>
      <p>Since the beginning of last week, BTC/USD has <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-drops-to-65k-as-traders-eye-cme-gap-bounce">slumped 20%</a>, while monthly losses now total around 30%. </p>
      <p>According to statistician Willy Woo, volatile behavior is set to continue as the halving approaches. Unlike the previous two halving events, he <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/willy-woo-8k-bearish-bitcoin-price-in-unique-setup-before-halving">noted</a>, 2020 is special, with Bitcoin approaching from a bearish perspective.</p>
      <p>Google interest meanwhile appears confined to Bitcoin — statistics for terms relating to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/altcoin">altcoins</a>, such as “Ethereum,” “ETH” and “XRP,” have stayed flat in recent weeks.</p>
