      <h1>Sam Mendes's single-take WW1 film 1917 declared an Oscar frontrunner after early screenings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:29:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-reporters/" target="_blank">Telegraph Reporters</a></address>
      <p>Sam Mendes' World War 1 epic 1917 has just injected the Oscars race - led by <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/upon-time-hollywood-spoilers-wild-ending-tarantino-shocking/">Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a> and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/irishman-true-true-story-behind-scorseses-best-film-decades/">Martin Scorsese's The Irishman </a>- with serious competition. </p>
      <p>The two-hour film, written by Mendes and Krysty Wilson-Cairns, stars George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman as two soldiers given eight hours to run into German territory and deliver a message to another British front line to stop an imminent British attack that will lead 1600 soldiers into a trap.</p>
      <p>The film plays out as one continuous shot, under the guidance of 14-time Oscar nominee Roger Deakins as director of photography, so that the point of view never leaves that of the soldiers. </p>
      <p>Critics who saw an advance screening of the film last night in New York - where Mendes told the audience many of the film's scenes were inspired by stories related to him by <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2019/08/01/1917-trailer-watch-andrew-scott-benedict-cumberbatch-sam-mendess/">his war veteran grandfather</a> - have been blown away. </p>
      <p>Critic Clayton Davis described the film as the Oscars "frontrunner": "1917 is the best war film since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. The cinematography of the year. The cinematography of the decade. Thomas Newman's orchestral masterpiece. Sam Mendes gift to cinema...and his family. Every ounce is powerful."</p>

      <p>Entertainment writer Mike Ryan said on Twitter: "1917 is quite a thing. Always intense, often horrific (at times it feels like watching an actual horror movie). I was skeptical of the "one continuous shot" aspect — worried it would get too cute with it — but it really works for this story, putting us right there in this hell". </p>
      <p>The Hollywood Reporter's Jason Osia wrote: "Mendes’ excellent 1917 joins the race: Almost unfathomable that cinematographer Deakins and production designer Gassner don’t win second Oscars and composer Newman doesn’t win Oscar #1. Pic, director, original screenplay noms almost certain, wins possible. Acting noms possible."</p>
      <p>Baby Driver director Edgar Wright said: "1917 is a thrilling, immersive, emotional journey into the heart of war. It’s exceptional on a technical level, yet frequently stunning in its simplicity. Sam Mendes &amp; DP Roger Deakin (along with their crew) created a hypnotic cinema experience that is both riveting &amp; moving."</p>
      <p>Film critic Tomris Laffly Tweeted: "Remember that Sam Mendes’ 1917 is co-written by a woman. Her name is Krysty Wilson-Cairns. This is her feature debut as a writer; one in which she conceived a one-shot war film. When it comes to female voices, it’s not just screen presence or the director’s chair that counts."</p>
