      <h1>The Bluffer is mugged in BA and how to report a crime in Irish</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:09:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:09</time> by <a rel="author">Robert McMillen</a></address>
      <p>Xin chào to everyone as the Bluffer is back from another unforgettable holiday in Vietnam - more about that soon!  </p>
      <p>Some people are <b>neirbhíseach</b> - nervous when they go away on holidays, fearing they may be mugged or robbed or take sick thousands of miles away from home - but not the Bluffer.</p>
      <p><b>Robáladh uair amháin é </b>- he was robbed once, in Buenos Aires, but <b>d’éirigh leis a chártaí a fháil ar ais</b> - he managed to get his cards back – that’s another story for another day – so he ended up losing a few hundred peso ie not very much.</p>
      <p>It’s time now to move to a parallel universe where no-one in Ireland understands English and everyone speaks Irish.</p>
      <p>Say you were robbed and had to report <b>an coir</b> - the crime, to your local Robo-Garda.</p>
      <p><b>Robáil</b> is a robbery so you would say to Garda or PC Plod <b>robáladh mé</b> - I’ve been robbed.</p>
      <p>The officer would then lick the end of his pencil and start to take down your particulars.</p>
      <p>He might ask you <b>cad é a goideadh?</b> - What was stolen? and you can explain it was your <b>sparán</b> - your purse, or your <b>guthán póca</b> - mobile phone or <b>airgead </b>- money.</p>
      <p><b>An bhfaca tú cé a rinne é? </b>- did you see who did it? is usually a superfluous question as pickpockets move with the poise and alacrity of ballet dancers as they separate you from your belongings.  </p>
      <p>You might also be asked <b>an raibh finnéithe ar bith ann?</b> Were there any witnesses?</p>
      <p>This, of course can all be a lot to take in as you will no doubt be distraught by the horrific event, even when no violence was used but generally, <b>na péas</b> - the police are very kind and understanding as the Bluffer explained.</p>
      <p>“The lady who helped me out in BA – there was a special office to help stricken tourists at the St Telmo market we were visiting at the time – was very kind but the chances of me getting my wallet back was always going to be less than zero.</p>
      <p>“Then, <b>go tobann</b> - suddenly, <b>fuair mé ríomphost</b> - I got an e-mail from a girl who said she had found my wallet, without the money but with all the cards, and if I wanted to collect it, I could call to her work, a hospital clinic in Rosario, a 45-minute taxi drive away. It was nearly <b>meán oíche</b> – midnight.</p>
      <p>“The Clash played in my head. <i>Should I stay or should I go</i>? </p>
      <p>I went. And met a lovely nurse who had been walking with her boyfriend when she saw my wallet on the ground. It contained my <b>sonraí teagmhála </b>- contact details which she used to e-mail me and so I was re-united with my <b>cártaí creidmheasa </b>- credit cards.</p>
      <p>“There are kind people all over the world!”</p>
      <p>It might be misplaced but the Bluffer feels <b>sábháilte </b>- safe wherever he goes.</p>
      <p>Having said that, he would never take a risk with is own or others’ safety.</p>
      <p><b>Chuaigh sé sa seans - </b>means he took a risk but safety is always the main priority.</p>
      <p>He’s just back from walking the streets of Hanoi, Hoi An, Nha Trang and Saigon and never once felt threatened. So here’s to more adventures!</p>
