      <p>A red Vauxhall Astra was the only vehicle involved in the crash.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old male driver and a 16-year-old girl, who was a passenger, were both rushed to Raigmore Hospital, Inverness.</p>
      <p>Medics describe their condition as serious but stable.</p>
      <p>The road was locked down for seven hours while investigations took place.</p>
      <p>Cops are still probing the incident and are appealing for any witnesses who can help them establish what happened.</p>
      <p>Sergeant David Miller of the Road Policing Unit in Dingwall said: "We are working to establish the full circumstances of this crash and would urge anyone who may have seen the Vauxhall Astra being driven between Bonar Bridge and Edderton to come forward.</p>
      <p>"Anyone who has a dashcam and was on the road is asked to review their footage and contact police if they have anything which may be relevant.</p>
      <p>"Anyone with information can contact police on 101, quoting incident 3961 of 24 November."</p>
