      <p>Infuriated Papa Jones took to social media to blast the TV station, after it posed a question to its viewers on whether the Yego hit maker deserved the win or not.</p>
      <p>In his post, Khali noted that the station was trying to play low-key to his win, instead of dedicating a whole show to celebrate his victory.</p>
      <p><i>“Snitch TV Kenya is trying to disrespect the OG, y’all should dedicate a whole show to celebrate this damn victory instead y’all trying to low-key hate on this Win, iyo ni swali Gani munauliza watu sasa? Mbona Sioni kama Mnauliza if Kipchoge deserved his win pia? We can’t help it, We are just winning cause we are good, Kwendeni Uko mbali pia nyinyi. And point of correction, Its not East Africa, Its Eastern Africa. </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/mrinternational/"><i>#mrinternational</i></a><i> </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/respecttheogs/"><i>#respecttheogs</i></a><i>”</i> wrote Khaligraph Jones.</p>
