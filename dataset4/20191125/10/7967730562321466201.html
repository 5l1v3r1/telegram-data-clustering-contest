      <p>Graham Russell of Clovelly has noticed that "Arnott's Ginger Nut biscuits are baked to different recipes in NSW and in Queensland 'exactly the way', according to the respective packaging, that particular state 'loves' them. Queensland Ginger Nuts are much softer than those in NSW (a certain Queensland Senator may beg to differ - Granny). This raises many questions in my mind, including why are our respective state tastes different? And in this state of origin of Ginger Nuts, which is best? And are there any other foods prepared to state recipes?"</p>

        <b>Keeping it in the pantry, George Manojlovic of Mangerton says: "The use-by date on my tub of honey is 23/10/21. Isn't that rather precise considering perfectly edible honey was found in 3000-year-old Egyptian tombs? It also got me wondering: Do C-8ers religiously adhere to use-by dates, or do they occasionally flirt with comestible peril?"</b>

      <p>"On the subject of left-handedness (C8), my late mother, Dr Lily Bennett, was the only woman at her medical school in England in the early 1930s," writes David Bennett of Woollahra. "She was ambidextrous (for the usual reason – a left-handed child being forced to use her right hand) and, when sitting for exams, she would write with one hand until it got tired and then change. She was regularly summoned before the examiners to demonstrate that both handwritings were indeed hers."</p>

        <b>We're pretty circumspect in giving out endorsements, but as we have a few Carols on board (Shepherd, Dawes, Harris and our own Carolyn Cummins), we thought we’d mention that <i>The Christmas Carols</i> will be the first Carols-only carolling group of its kind, honoured to sing in the iconic Queen Victoria Building. That’s right, the QVB is calling all Carols (Carolines, Caroles, Caroliens, Carrolyns, Carolyns and Caros too). The collective will be led through rehearsals with esteemed conductor Bek Jensen (seems Karel Mark Chichon was busy) before a one-off performance under the central dome on December 16. There is a form on the QVB website.</b>
