      <p>Taapsee Pannu is among those actresses in the industry who don't shy away from stating their opinion in public. In the past, the Game Over actress has shut down trolls like a boss and she continues to do so till date.</p>
      <p>Recently, Taapsee was invited as a speaker at the International Film Festival of India in Goa. While she was interacting with the audience at the event, Taapsee was interrupted by a guest who asked her to speak in Hindi as she is a Hindi film actress. Taapsee replied saying, "Sir, main to pura Hindi me baat karsakti hoon, par kya yahan sabko Hindi samajh aayegi?"</p>
      <p>She added, "Main south Indian actress bhi hoon... Tamil aur Telugu main bhi baat karu?"</p>
      <p>The crowd cheered for Taapsee soon after she gave a befitting reply to the guest. The video of the actress shunning the guest has gone viral.</p>
