        <b>People in Sweden have the longest expected working life of any EU country, according to new data from number crunchers Eurostat.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A 15-year-old in Sweden can expect to spend 41.9 years in the labour market, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Duration_of_working_life_-_statistics#Sweden_and_the_Netherlands_have_longest_working_life">Eurostat</a> figures show.</p>
      <p>That makes Sweden one of only two countries, along with the Netherlands, where 15-year-olds are expected to work for more than 40 years.</p>
      <p>There was a difference between genders, with the expected working life for women 41 years compared to 42.9 years for men.</p>

      <p>Iceland, although not in the EU, has an even higher expected working life at 46.3 years. And Italian teenagers can expect to spend the shortest time in the labour market; an average of just 31.8 years – more than a decade less than their Swedish peers.</p>
      <p>The average expected duration of working life across the EU was 36.2 years, which was 3.3 years longer than in 2000 when the data was first collected.</p>
