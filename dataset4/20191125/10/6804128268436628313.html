      <h1>West Ham fans fumed at Manuel Pellegrini for Carlos Sanchez substitution but it made sense</h1>
      <h2>The Hammers manager introduced the Colombian with 25 minutes of the game to go on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>It was a decision that was roundly booed by the home faithful, those who has remained at London Stadium anyway, when Manuel Pellegrini brought on Carlos Sanchez against Spurs at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The Hammers were 3-0 down, heading for another demoralising defeat at home, a fifth defeat in seven games and the slide down the table was to continue.</p>
      <p>Sanchez, who has previously played just 14 minutes in the Premier League all season, was introduced with Issa Diop making way, a decision which didn't go down well in east London. The Colombian's signing has pretty much summed up the recruitment of the past two summers - its not really panned out.</p>
      <p>Diop had already been booked, wrongly, in the first half by Michael Oliver for tussling with Harry Kane and was walking a tightrope as the Frenchman continues to show worrying signs of regression, or simply stopping progressing, so far this season. The defender had a terrible game against Jose Mourinho's team.</p>
      <p>Diop will be suspended for the trip to Chelsea next Saturday afternoon. His substitution against Spurs meant that it was the first time this season he has failed to finish a game in all competitions in 2019/20.</p>
      <p>Declan Rice dropped into centre half and Sanchez took up the defensive midfield role he usually plays, when he's in the squad. He's barely figured in the matchday 18 this season coming off the back of a serious knee injury in 2018/19.</p>

      <p>While the decision was booed roundly in E20, it did make sense.</p>
      <p>With Fabian Balbuena dropped from the team for a second time this season as he too shows serious signs of decline from last year, Rice may well be playing at centre back when the Hammers travel to west London this weekend.</p>
      <p>The only defender who has shown any sort of form this season is Angelo Ogbonna, who was rightly restored to the starting lineup for the Spurs game.</p>
      <p>He will start next weekend, there is no doubt, but with Rice shifting back to centre half it certainly seemed that Pellegrini is thinking that the midfielder, converted from a centre back, will play there next weekend.</p>
      <p>Rice hasn't played at centre back for some time, certainly not regularly since the David Moyes-era and even then, it wasn't that often but with Diop suspended and Balbuena struggling, the Englishman could find himself at the heart of the defence at Stamford Bridge.</p>

      <p>That's not to say that Sanchez plays in Rice's usual defensive midfield spot however. While the Colombian did bring some sense of stability to the midfield after his introduction, having played so little and then being thrown in against Chelsea is asking for trouble.</p>
      <p>What are the alternatives? Mark Noble plays a more defensive role and another midfielder comes in, perhaps Pablo Fornals to play in a more central role rather than one on the wing.</p>

      <p>Pablo Zabaleta could play in defensive midfield but would more than likely struggle, so Sanchez does seem like the logical move for Pellegrini.</p>
      <p>While the manager is rightly coming under-fire after some truly terrible performances from his players in recent week, who also need to take a long look at themselves by the way, bringing on the Colombian against Spurs did actually make sense.</p>
      <p>Rice will have the chance to be more of a leader from centre back, he has the ability and capability to do that. It sees ridiculous that the club should be looking at a 20-year-old to provide some oomph to their lethargic team but that's the situation they find themselves in.</p>
