      <p>FIVE TEENAGERS, INCLUDING a 13-year-old girl, have been arrested after seven police officers were injured at a Birmingham cinema, at a screening of Blue Story a film about gang violence in London.</p>
      <p>Police were called to Star City on Saturday evening following reports of youths with machetes.</p>
      <p>Two of the weapons were seized, alongside another knife, and seven officers were left with facial injuries, according to West Midlands Police.</p>
      <p>A dispersal order was used to clear the group of up to 100.</p>
      <p>A 13-year-old girl, a girl and a boy, both aged 14, and a 19-year-old man were held on suspicion of assaulting police.</p>
      <p>A 14-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of obstructing police.</p>
      <p>Investigators have asked anyone with any video or pictures of the incident to get in touch.</p>
      <p>Superintendent Ian Green said: “This was a major outbreak of trouble which left families who were just trying to enjoy a night-out at the cinema understandably frightened.</p>
      <p>“We […] were met with a very hostile response and officers had to draw tasers to restore order.</p>
      <blockquote>It’s clear that some of those who went to Star City last night were intent on causing trouble.</blockquote>
      <p>Chief Superintendent Steve Graham said the force used by officers was “proportionate”, adding that the disorder took 90 minutes to break up because police were not “heavy-handed”.</p>
      <p>Asked where the incident ranked compared with other reports of disorder, Mr Graham said: “It’s always hard to gauge these sorts of things – but what I will say is incidents like last night are rare.</p>
      <p>“As for some officers who were there [on Saturday], it may be the worst thing they have ever seen.”</p>
      <p>Two cinema chains – Vue and Showcase Cinemas – have said they are pulling Blue Story from its screens.</p>
      <p>A Vue spokesman said: “We can confirm a decision was made to remove the film.</p>
      <p>“The safety and welfare of our customers and staff is always our first priority.”</p>
      <p>Film writer and director Andrew Onwubolu described the incident as “truly unfortunate” and said he hoped it was not an “indictment” of the film.</p>
      <p>He also compared the violence to that which occurred during The Joker’s US screen run, where there were safety fears due to fringe calls for violence at screenings.</p>
      <p>Onwubolu said on Instagram on Sunday afternoon: “Sending love to all those involved in yesterday’s violence at Star City in Birmingham.</p>
      <blockquote>It’s truly unfortunate that a small group of people can ruin things for everybody. Bluestory is a film about love not violence.</blockquote>
