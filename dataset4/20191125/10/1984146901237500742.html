      <p>Ben Dawson believes that the re-introduction of Steve Harper at Benton can only benefit Newcastle United and boost the club's aim to hand more Academy youngsters their chance in the first team.</p>
      <p>In the last 12 months, Sean and Matty Longstaff have broken into the senior squad while the likes of Lewis Cass, Kell Watts and Elias Sorensen have come close to a place in the senior squad.</p>
      <p>Harper's new role will mean that there is a daily dialogue between Dawson and the former goalkeeper with the Easington-born coach then feeding information back to Steve Bruce and his back-room team.</p>
      <p>Bruce wants to know who is close to playing and training with the senior squad in the event of injuries.</p>
      <p>Dawson, who worked with Harper last season as the Under-23s reached two cup finals, told the Chronicle: "It's a catch 22 having one site or split sites.</p>
      <p>"When we were up at the first team base you always took it for granted that people communicated.</p>
      <p>"But communication is a little better now we are out of sight.</p>
      <p>"When it's like that you have to (communicate).</p>
      <p>"So having that designated person who you can have that conversation with about players.</p>
      <p>"You can talk about if anybody is coming down to the Academy or going in the other direction.</p>
      <p>"It means the first team squad can focus on the game on a weekend."</p>
      <p>Rafa Benitez felt the first team training base was too chaotic when he took over the club in 2016 and since then the Under-23 squad have trained at Little Benton.</p>
      <p>It's something that Bruce has stuck with but he felt the need for more information from the second string was badly needed.</p>

      <p>Although, there has been some disruption behind the scenes after Neil Redfearn quit his post as Under-23 boss recently leaving Dawson to resume his old position and continue as director of coaching.</p>
      <p>When asked how things have been since Redfearn walked away, Dawson said: "The lads have just carried on.</p>
      <p>"I don't think much has changed and that is how it should be.</p>
      <p>"We're trying to put something in place where no matter who is in charge, what we do stays the same.</p>
      <p>"You could see that against Benfica, we were organised and compact and got on the front-foot.</p>
      <p>"We will always look to press when we can and when we do get the ball we want to try to play.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes the opposition don't let you do what you want to do but we are after the same thing from the Under-23s right down to the Under-9s.</p>
      <p>"We are trying to get that structure in place and hopefully it will get more players though that first team door and pathway."</p>

      <p>Dawson, who United appointed caretaker manager in the summer as they searched for a replacement for Benitez, will now help look for a new Under-23 manager to work with.</p>
      <p>He said: "At this moment in time we are going to have to look at that because of the number of games coming up.</p>
      <p>"Getting another person we think is right for the job might take some time, it might not.</p>
      <p>"We'll just have to wait and see as we go through the process."</p>
      <p>United's second string had an excellent season last term as they reached both the Premier League play-off final and the Premier League Cup final.</p>
      <p>This season they have already been knocked out of the EFL Trophy but remain in the Premier League Cup and the Premier League International Cup.</p>
      <p>Dawson hopes his side can emulate last season's efforts, he said: "Any cup run helps our players in terms of individual development.</p>
      <p>"It gives them a great experience.</p>
      <p>"You never know what experience you are going to need along the path.</p>
      <p>"We spoke in our meeting before the game about reaching the semi-finals when we played FC Porto and how such nights are special.</p>
      <p>"They don't come along very often so you have to make the most of it."</p>
