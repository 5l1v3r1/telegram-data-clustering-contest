      <p>Bob Waldrop had a way of making you laugh even as he twisted the knife.</p>
      <p>“The executive summary of my opinion is: ‘This is social cruelty in action,’” was his assessment of the Oklahoma City Council’s 2015 attempt to crack down on panhandling.</p>
      <p>Pilgrim, friend to the poor, liturgical music director, political candidate, Robert Max Augustine Waldrop (@bobwaldrop) died this year at age 66, succumbing to cancer on Aug. 30.</p>
      <p>Bob made his living as music director at Epiphany of the Lord Catholic Church and did his living in a 1929 bungalow in the Gatewood neighborhood, where he devoted himself to a sustainable lifestyle at his “Gatewood Urban Homestead,” a nod to his Tillman County roots.</p>
      <p>He founded the Oscar Romero Catholic Worker House, with its mission to feed the needy.</p>
      <p>And he used his losing challenge to Councilwoman Meg Salyer in 2015 to highlight unmet needs in Ward 6, saying residents felt “left behind and ignored.”</p>
      <p>Even as his cancer advanced last summer, he busied himself with commentary on MAPS 4, Municipal Court amnesty, and health coverage for the poor.</p>
      <p>Bob likely was heartened by MAPS 4’s pivot toward sheltering the homeless, treating the mentally ill, and connecting the impoverished; disheartened by insistence in some quarters that social service agencies justify their claim on the public purse with charts and graphs showing how they intended to measure “outcomes;” and heartened by the pushback from current Ward 6 Councilwoman JoBeth Hamon.</p>
      <p>Bob had written last spring that there continued "to be no good news from the docs."</p>
      <p>“Friends are sending me to Lourdes,” he said, “and the original plan was an October trip but the oncologist said to not wait that long.</p>
      <p>“I continue to be at peace and even content," Waldrop continued, "which is sort of a mind-blowing experience since I used to be a world-class worrier about my health.</p>
      <p>“It’s not over until it’s over and even then, it’s not really over, it’s more of a transition to a new reality.</p>
      <p>“Details of that, of course, are somewhat sketchy but if there are jobs in the afterlife, I intend to apply for one to visit certain politicians in their dreams.”</p>
      <p>He closed that note with reports on work (playing all 11 Holy Week services at Epiphany), insurance (thankful to have it), writing (how to condense a life into an affordable newspaper obituary notice), and medical marijuana (helps with the nausea and appetite).</p>
      <p>He signed himself “rmw” and hit send; his note arrived at 3:46 p.m. on Good Friday.</p>
      <p>Six weeks later he was on his way to France.</p>
      <p>Along the way, he managed to start a lively Twitter debate with photos of sidewalk vendors and street musicians (legal in Paris, "basically" outlawed in Oklahoma City).</p>
      <p>Bob is poised to add a legislative victory to his legacy when the Oklahoma City Council votes next week on proposals sponsored by Hamon to drop licensing and permit requirements for most street entertainers.</p>
      <p>"I believe this might possibly be the first Twitter-instigated ordinance change in city history," Mayor David Holt said earlier this month.</p>
      <p>On June 2, Bob took the train to Lourdes (U.S transportation is “primitive” by comparison, he observed) and tweeted a photo captioned, in Twitter shorthand, “The Grotto at Lourdes where Our Lady appeared to Saint Bernadette.”</p>
      <p>Then the pilgrim headed home.</p>
