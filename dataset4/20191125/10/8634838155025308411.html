        <b>The Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA) on Monday, November 25, announced a major disruption of traffic within Nairobi.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a press statement, the authority cited the Grand Nairobi Bike race set for Sunday, December 1, as the cause of the temporal closure of several roads across the capital for half a day.</p>
      <p>"This is to notify the general public that traffic along Lang'ata Road, Aerodrome Road, Lower Hill Road, Uhuru Highway, Haile Selassie, and Bunyala Road will be disrupted from 8:00 a.m. till 12:30 p.m.," read their press statement in part.</p>

      <p>Motorists were advised to find alternative routes on the day, as traffic marshalls would seal off the aforementioned roads as well as the busy Uhuru Highway to make room for the race.</p>
      <p>The race provides a rare day for cyclists ranging from children, recreational, and professional cyclists to grace the streets of Nairobi.</p>
      <p>According to information provided by the event organisers, an estimated 1,000 cyclists are expected to participate in the historic event.</p>
      <p>"We feel that this is an opportune time to hold a race on the streets of Nairobi with the aspirations of making Nairobi and Kenya at large, a cycling destination for enthusiasts, showcasing the efforts going towards better public transport inclusion and reduced fuel emissions," read a section of the Grand Nairobi Bike Race press release.</p>
      <p>In a similar move, the government on Friday, November 22, 2019,<a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46708-busy-nairobi-road-be-closed-1-week"> issued a notice to the public stating that a section of King'ara Road,</a> Nairobi would be closed for 10 days, from Monday, December 2, 2019, to Wednesday, December 11, 2019.</p>
      <p>The closure of the road is expected to affect adjacent roads like Ngong Road.</p>
