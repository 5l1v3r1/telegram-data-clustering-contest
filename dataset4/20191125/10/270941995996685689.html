        <b>A German state museum with one of the biggest collection of baroque treasures in Europe has been raided by thieves, police said Monday, with media estimates of losses of up to a billion euros.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Green Vault at Dresden's Royal Palace, which is home to around 4,000 precious objects made of ivory, gold, silver and jewels, was broken into early Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Police confirmed a "break-in at the Green Vault" and said the thieves were on the run.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.thelocal.de/20191125/dresden-museum-break-in-probably-the">The theft was described as the biggest art theft since World War Two.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Officials did not give an estimate but Bild newspaper reported that "antique jewellery worth around a billion euros has been stolen".</p>
      <p>Three jewellery sets of diamonds and rubies were stolen, director Marion Ackermann said, calling the haul "priceless".</p>
      <p>Ackermann refused to estimate the exact value of the items stolen from a display cabinet at the near 300-year-old Green Vault museum in Dresden, adding that the jewellery was of "inestimable cultural and historical value".</p>
      <p>Bild reported that the criminals had broken into the well-protected palace by attacking a nearby power distributor and climbing through a window.</p>
      <p>They then proceeded to target smaller items of jewellery, leaving larger, bulkier items behind, Bild claimed, without citing sources.</p>
      <p>The Green Vault is one of the oldest museums in Europe, having been founded by the August the Strong, Elector of Saxony in 1723.</p>

      <p>One of 12 museums which make up the famous Dresden State Art Collections, the vault is split into a historic and a newer exhibition.</p>
      <p>The historic section, which contains around three quarters of the museum's treasures, was the one broken into on Monday.</p>
      <p>Its treasures include a 63.8-centimetre figure of a Moor studded with emeralds and a 547.71-carat sapphire.</p>
      <p>The theft is the second high-profile heist in Germany in recent years, after a 100kg, 24-carat giant gold coin was stolen from Berlin's Bode Museum in 2017.</p>
