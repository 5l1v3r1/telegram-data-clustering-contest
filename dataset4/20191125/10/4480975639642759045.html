      <p>WTI (oil futures on NYMEX) posts small gains near $ 58 mark in the European session this Monday, lacking a clear directional bias despite improved <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment/risk-appetite">risk appetite</a> on fresh US-China trade optimism.   </p>
      <p>However, the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a> around the black <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/commodities/metals/gold">gold</a> remains somewhat underpinned by the fresh hopes of a US-China trade deal following the recent upbeat comments from the US and China while Beijing’s gesture to raise the penalties on the Intellectual Properties (IP) theft also rekindled expectations of a trade truce.</p>
      <p>The gains in the barrel of WTI remains capped mainly due to broad-based US dollar strength, driven by the rise in the US Treasury yields amid a risk-on market profile. The US dollar index bounces back to test the weekly tops of 98.30, modestly flat on the day. A stronger greenback makes the USD-denominated oil more expensive for the holders in foreign currencies.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the bulls were also left unimpressed by the latest CME OPEC Watch Tool that showed that the OPEC+ is likely to leave the output cut policy unchanged when it meets in Vienna on Dec, 5. <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/cme-opec-watch-tool-probability-of-opec-maintaining-output-cuts-stands-at-8151-201911250723">CME OPEC Watch Tool: Probability of OPEC+ maintaining output cuts stands at 81.51%</a></p>
      <p>Markets now await the US weekly crude supply reports and fresh developments on the US-China trade front to gauge the next direction in the commodity.</p>
