      <p>Jenna Dewan has denied taking a swipe at Camila Cabello.</p>
      <p>Many fans on social media believed the pregnant actress was feuding with the singer, after she appeared to make a disparaging comment about her.</p>
      <p>While watching Camila perform the song Senorita with Shawn Mendes at the American Music Awards, footage of the star appeared to show her potentially saying “She’s so extra” during the set.</p>

      <p>The Step Up actress took to Instagram Stories to clear up the rumours.</p>
      <p>“I’m getting a lot of text messages from people wondering if I was shading Camila,” she said.</p>
      <p>“No! I love her, I love her so much. I don’t understand what that’s about but no, I love her, love her, love her.”</p>
