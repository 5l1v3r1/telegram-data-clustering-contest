      <h1>Tottenham star Dele Alli told what he must change to succeed under Jose Mourinho</h1>
      <h2>The Spurs midfielder has had his critics recently but is looking to get back to his best under his new manager and played a key part in his side's win over West Ham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:09:12+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:09</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Former Tottenham striker Garth Crooks believes Dele Alli must do more work off the ball if he is to thrive under new manager Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old played a big role in Spurs' 3-2 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on Saturday, creating an assist for their first goal and pulling off a delightful bit of skill when it looked like the ball was going out of play to help set up the second.</p>
      <p>Alli suffered a disappointing season during the last campaign, scoring just five Premier League goals compared to nine, 18 and 10 in his previous three seasons.</p>
      <p>But Crooks thinks the England international can get back to his best under Mourinho as long as he does more off the ball and improves his attitude.</p>

      <p>Writing in his <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50539143">BBC team of the week</a> column Crooks said: "The move into the space, the turn and the pass from Dele Alli for Son Heung-min to do what he does best was superb.</p>
      <p>"However, what took place minutes later in the match at West Ham was something out of a box of magic tricks. The ball is running out of play, it's caught by Alli while falling to the ground and, while on the floor, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> forward back heels the ball into Son's path - who then provides the perfect cross for Lucas Moura to slot home.</p>
      <p>"If Alli is going to be a success under Jose Mourinho, he will have to do more off the ball. Chuntering under his breath when the manager substitutes him after 70 minutes will not endear him either. Mourinho is only interested in team players."</p>
      <p>Mourinho praised Alli after the match, saying he has the potential to be one of the best players in the world.</p>

      <p>"I spent a few minutes with him in training, and also in our social life outside the pitch, and we were speaking that the best Dele has to be back," he told BT Sport.</p>
      <p>"He is too good to not be in the national team. He is too good to not be a fundamental player for Spurs.</p>
      <p>"He is too good to not be one of the best players in the world, so he has to start now to, without injuries, hopefully have some stability, and he is a fantastic player."</p>
