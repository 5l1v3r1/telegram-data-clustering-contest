        <b>Helb takes another step in demanding money back</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kenyans who are employed and have not been paying back loans are receiving an SMS from Helb in an attempt to recover back money owed.</p>
      <p>The text message seen by <i>Pulselive.co.ke</i> indicated that Helb had data of <a href="https://www.pulselive.co.ke/news/warning-helb-to-publish-names-and-photos-of-loan-defaulters-from-1975-to-date/crg1xw0">loan defaulters who are in formal employment</a> and they are actively pursuing the Ksh10 billion owed by defaulters since 1975.</p>
      <p>"<i>Greetings! Helb is aware that you are formally employed. Kindly pay at least Ksh 4,500 to avoid penalties</i>," the message partly read.</p>
      <p>Under the Helb act, the institution is mandated to visit all employers in Kenya and establish whether its employees owe any monies to Helb.</p>
