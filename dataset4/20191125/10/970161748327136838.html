      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> has been accused of ‘deceit’ after promising to deliver 50,000 more nurses when nearly half of them are already working for the NHS.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister’s recruitment pledge is a key policy in the Conservative election manifesto, but it was soon questioned when it emerged 18,500 of the 50,000 are existing nurses who the government hopes to persuade to remain in the workforce.</p>
      <p>And it turns out Mr Johnson has also included 12,500 foreign nurses who they will recruit from abroad to help plug the existing vacancy gap, which currently stands at more than 43,000.</p>
      <p>Labour pointed out only 19,000 posts would be filled by brand-new nurse trainees.</p>
      <p>Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ‘The Conservatives’ claim on nurses is frankly deceitful – the sums simply don’t add up.</p>
      <p>‘First we had Johnson’s fake 40 new hospitals, now we have his fake 50,000 extra nurses.’</p>

      <p>The Conservative manifesto also reintroduces a nurse bursary – which the Government had scrapped – worth £5,000 to £8,000 per year.</p>

      <p>Labour has said it will recruit 24,000 extra nurses and has pledged to reinstate NHS student bursaries worth £20,000 a year in maintenance and support.</p>
      <p>The Tory manifesto also says there will be 6,000 more doctors in GP surgeries and 6,000 more primary care staff such as physiotherapists and pharmacists.</p>
      <p>But Dr Jennifer Dixon, chief executive at the Health Foundation, said that ‘even with major improvement in training, recruitment and retention, we have projected that almost half of the 50,000 nurses promised would have to be recruited from other countries.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘This will be challenging and means migration policy must not be a barrier.</p>
      <p>‘And with the number of qualified permanent full-time equivalent GPs having decreased by around 5% since the last target was set, there must be realism about what can be achieved in the timescales set out.’</p>

      <p>Donna Kinnair, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘The current shortage of 43,000 registered nurses can only be filled by registered nurses – with degree-level education.</p>
      <p>‘It is unfair on staff and inappropriate for patients to try to plug this gap with other staff.’</p>
      <p>She said ‘more detail’ was needed on where the 50,000 nurses would come from, adding: ‘The emphasis must be firmly on growing the domestic workforce, as while we welcome nursing colleagues from around the world, an over-reliance on international recruitment is neither sustainable nor ethical in the long-term.’</p>

      <p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the extra 50,000 nurses would be brought in over the parliament through ‘a combination of training and extra university places, also nurse apprenticeships which allow people to train as they work, and there will be some recruitment from overseas with our new NHS visa’.</p>
      <p>On nurse bursaries, he declined to say they should never have been scrapped but said there was a need to provide ‘incentives’.</p>

      <p>Culture secretary Nicky Morgan struggled to explain the NHS plan when questioned by Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain.</p>
      <p>Piers Morgan said viewers would think the 50,000 more nurses claim is ‘complete nonsense’ and the cabinet minister replied: ‘There are other ways nurses come in to the NHS. There will be overall, and we’re very, very clear on this, 50,000 more nurses if you look in 10 years’ time.’</p>
      <p>Host Susannah Reid then said: ‘But it’s not more nurses.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘Isn’t it a bit like saying, on Good Morning Britain tomorrow morning there will be three more presenters – and then tomorrow you have exactly the same number of presenters because you managed to persuade me, Piers and Charlotte to carry on doing the job.’</p>
