        <b>Interior Cabinet Secretary <b>Fred Matiang'i's </b>chopper was forced to land on Monday, November 25 after a crucial advisory.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to <i>Citizen TV,</i> the government chopper ferrying Matiang'i, Devolution CS <b>Eugene Wamalwa </b>and Inspector-General of Police <b>Hilary Mutyambai</b> was forced to land in Eldoret due to bad weather.</p>
      <p>The three were headed to Kapenguria Referral Hospital to meet victims of Saturday’s West Pokot landslides that left more than 37 people dead. They also sought to meet West Pokot leaders.</p>

      <p>"We have forced to land in Eldoret, we were on our way to Kapenguria hospital. We left Nairobi at 8:30 a.m. and we did not want to defy the advisory by pilots and experts," Matiang'i explained.</p>
      <p>The CS had hoped to spend the day working with the County Government of West Pokot, to address critical challenges the residents were facing as a result of the deadly landslides.</p>
      <p>“It looks like it is very difficult for the helicopters we are using to fly into Kapenguria because it is still raining. It is very foggy, and visibility is not very clear. Because of safety and security considerations, we have been advised to divert to Eldoret,” the Super CS affirmed.</p>
      <p>Matiang’i further added that depending on the advisory they would receive in the course of the day, they would either spend the night in Eldoret and fly into Kapenguria on Tuesday morning or fly back to Nairobi until the weather cleared.</p>
      <p>He also assured residents that the national government was committed to addressing the challenges the people of West Pokot were facing.</p>
      <p>“We have sent some relief supply ahead. I know that because the roads are very difficult to navigate at this time, some of the food and items like blankets may be late to arrive, however, we dispatched some food both from Eldoret and Nairobi and we will continue to support them,” he added.</p>
