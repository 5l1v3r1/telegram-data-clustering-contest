      <p>TULSA — Whatever Gov. Kevin Stitt is selling, the leaders of Oklahoma's five largest Indian tribes aren't buying.</p>
      <p>"It felt like a used car salesman thing, telling me I need a vehicle, and I'm saying, 'No I don't, I have a good vehicle,'" one of them, Choctaw Chief Gary Batton, said Friday.</p>
      <p>Instead of a car, though, Stitt is trying to sell the tribes on the idea of new gaming compacts. The tribes say the ones they have are fine and they are under no obligation to trade them in.</p>
      <p>"What are they willing to offer?" said Batton. "What is that written proposal? What do they have to offer of interest?"</p>
