      <h1>Best Currys PC World Black Friday 2019 deals in their early sale, including discounts on tech and home appliances</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:05:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/lela-london/" target="_blank">Lela London</a></address>
      <p>Currys PC World always goes above and beyond for<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/2019/11/25/black-friday-2019-deals-date-do-uk-sales-start-find-best-available/"> Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday. The tech-peddling retail giant almost approaches the sales event like it's a charitable cause; last year it knocked £100s off of TVs, kitchen appliances, laptops, gaming consoles and more.</p>
      <p>Adopting a somewhat precarious sales tactic for one of the industry’s most competitive days, it even price-matched most major retailers’ <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/best-black-friday-deals-2019-uk-what-offers-discounts-where/">best Black Friday deals</a>. </p>
      <p>Nonetheless, it works. The store's website is known to receive over half a million visitors before 6am on the day itself and that number is only expected to increase this year.</p>
      <p>Whether you’re browsing Black Friday deals for new tech or simply want to find a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/0/best-christmas-gift-ideas-2019-guide-top-presents-wish-list/">Christmas gift</a> cool enough to warrant a smile from your teenage cousin, Currys PC World will likely have you covered. And, as they've started to put together a selection of pre-Black Friday deals, there is already a <i>lot </i>on offer:</p>

      <p>There are tonnes of TVs on sale in the run up to Black Friday, but all aren't created equal. This 55-inch Ultra HD Samsung is a cut above (most of) the rest; its technology improves both picture colour and clarity, the sound system is Dolby Atmos (yes, just like the cinema),  and its 4K display ensures every pixel you see <i>matters</i>. With ThinQ AI, LG's voice command platform, you can even ask your TV to play something on Netflix, turn on the news, or boost the sound.</p>

      <p>It's not everyday you get £400 knocked off one of the world's most luxurious appliances, but that day is upon us. Samsung's RS8000 RS68N8330B1/EU (not the best name, we agree) American-Style Fridge Freezer is the Black Friday deal your kitchen has been waiting for. Time to upgrade the old to a new and totally frost-free, space-saving model (with water and ice dispenser). No plumbing required.</p>

      <p>If there's one kitchen appliance most of us Brits can't live without, it's a brilliant kettle, so why not treat yourself to the best? This contemporary kettle from Breville is as good as it looks; boiling as rapidly (with a 3000 W element) as it does beautifully (a bright white illumination is triggered as it heats). If rose gold doesn't suit your countertop aesthetic, you can take your pick of four additional colourways.</p>
