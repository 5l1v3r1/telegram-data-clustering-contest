      <h1>Speculations rife as Jyotiraditya Scindia removes references to Congress from Twitter bio after reportedly meeting PM Modi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:03:23+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:03</time> by <a rel="author">JKR Staff</a></address>
      <p>In a dramatic development, senior Congress leader Jyotiradiya Scindia has changed his bio on Twitter by dropping all references to his party, the Congress. His current bio reads, “public servant and cricket enthusiast.” Earlier, his Twitter bio read, “Former Member of Parliament, Guna (200-20019) | Former Minister for Power (I/C); MoS Commerce &amp; Industry; MoS Communications, IT &amp; Post.” The latest move assumes significance in light of Scindia’s reported meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi a few days ago.</p>

      <p>Scindia has clarified that there was no hidden political agenda behind his decision to drop all Congress references from Twitter. “A month back I had changed my bio on Twitter. On people’s advice I had made my bio shorter. Rumours regarding this are baseless,” Jyotiraditya Scindia told news agency ANI.</p>
      <p>Scindia has reportedly been sulking after being denied the chief minister’s post in Madhya Pradesh last year. He lost his Guna Lok Sabha seat in this year’s parliamentary polls.</p>
      <p>Aside from being a critic of his party’s government led by Kamal Nath in Madhya Pradesh, Scindia had also extended his backing to the BJP government’s decision to revoke Article 370 on Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
      <p>The news of Scindia dropping his association with Congress on Twitter caused him to trend nationally. The development also came close on the heels of the Congress making desperate attempts to stitch an alliance with the Shiv Sena to form a government in Maharashtra. The grand old political party of India had to face mass defection in Karnataka leading to the fall of its government.</p>
