      <h3>A TOTAL of 244 persons have been apprehended by the police across the country for violating President Duterte’s order banning the use of vapes in public, Philippine National Police spokesman, Brigadier General Bernard M. Banac said yesterday.</h3>
      <p>The PNP spokesperson said that the apprehensions were the result of 2,878 operations conducted nationwide by the police as a result of the presidential directive prohibiting the use of vapes and e-cigarette products in public places.</p>
      <p>He said that after they were taken to the police station for documentation in police blotters, the vape ban violators were immediately released without charges.</p>
      <p>Banac said police confiscated 318 pieces of vape gadgets and 666 pieces of vape juices.<br/>The Police Regional Office 7 headed by Brig. Gen. Valeriano T. del Leon made the biggest haul of vaping violators with 195 apprehended. The National Capital Region Police Office headed by Brig. Gen. Debold M. Sinas hauled in 10 violators to the precinct.</p>
      <p>The PNP on orders of its Officer-in-Charge Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa is using Republic Act No. 8749 or the Clean Air Act and the Republic Act No. 9211 or the Tobacco Regulation Act I as basis for carrying out the President’s directive to arrest individuals who are vaping in public.</p>
