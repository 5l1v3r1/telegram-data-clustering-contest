      <p>There have already been a handful of sim racers make the move to real life racing, perhaps most notably Jann Mardenborough, who went from sim racer to Le Mans starter and is currently in Super GT in Japan.</p>
      <p>Norris said, according to RaceFans.net: <i>“In the future I think you can get people who start in Esports and come over.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“I don’t think they can go straight from Esports to Formula 1, they would have to still do some steps: F3, F2 and so on. But I think there’s already been some drivers who have proved that having skills on the simulator can translate very well onto the actual race track.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“The better the simulators get and everything then the higher the chance of something like that happening.”</i>
