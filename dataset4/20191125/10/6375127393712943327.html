      <h3>Duterte pushed into firing veep — Panelo</h3>
      <p>Vice President Leni Robredo herself and her political party   pushed President Rodrigo Duterte into firing her as co-chair of the Inter-Agency Committee on Illegal Drugs (ICAD), presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo said yesterday.</p>
      <p>“Yung presidente mismo ng Partido Liberal was asking the President to fire her... Ang pinakamatindi, si VP Leni, nung magsalita si Presidente, ano ang naging tugon niya? Sabi niya, ‘Kung ayaw mo sa akin, sabihin mo.’ Ayun, pinagbigyan siya,” Panelo said “In other words, you cannot do that to the President. In-appoint ka na nga, pinagbigyan ka na nga ng pagkakataon makatulong sa bansa pagkatapos ay babastusin mo pa. Kung ikaw naman ang nasa lugar ni Presidente, ano ang gagawin mo?” he added.</p>
      <p>Last week, Robredo said that Duterte should tell her to her face if he no longer wants her in ICAD after he said he cannot trust her.</p>
      <p>Duterte sacked Robredo from her ICAD post on Sunday, just over two weeks after she accepted Malacañang’s appointment for her.</p>
      <p>Panelo reiterated that Robredo sought the wrong audience and did not ask the President directly about her queries regarding her mandate.</p>
      <p>“As always, she talked—not with her appointing authority—but right in front of the cameras asking the President on her supposed mandate,” Panelo said.</p>
      <p>At the Senate, Senate President Vicente Sotto III described Robredo’s short stint at ICAD as “sayang.”</p>
      <p>“The appointment of the Vice President as ICAD co-chair is based on trust. Once trust is lost, the position is lost. We have a word for it in Filipino — Sayang,” Sotto said in a message to reporters.</p>
      <p>In the 19 days since Robredo accepted the post, she has visited Market 3 in Navotas City, a hotspot in the police’s anti-drug operations; met with reformed drug users in Dinalupihan, Bataan; and gone to a drug rehabilitation center in Quezon City.</p>
      <p>She has also met with anti-drugs stakeholders such as the Dangerous Drugs Board, the Department of the Interior and Local Government, and the Department of Health.<br/>Panelo said that the Palace doesn’t need to release any formal document for Robredo’s removal as ICAD co-chair. “Hindi na kailangan ‘yun. Basta nag-announce na si Presidente na she was removed from office, ‘yun na ‘yun,” he said.</p>
      <p>“‘Yung mga inappoint ng Presidente, at the pleasure of the President ‘yun. ‘Yun na ‘yun, hindi na kailangan na sulatan pa siya,” he added.</p>
      <p>He also described as “nonsense” the criticisms stating that Duterte was threatened with the possibility of Robredo becoming a viable presidential candidate in 2022.</p>
      <p>“If the President had that in mind, he would not have appointed her in the first place,” Panelo said in a separate interview on ANC.</p>
      <p>Panelo was one of those who previously urged Robredo to accept Duterte’s offer on the ICAD position as he described it as a “ladder to the presidency.”</p>
      <p>The presidential spokesperson was asked whether a dialogue between Duterte and Robredo is still possible after what happened. “Everything is possible,” he answered.</p>
      <p>PDEA, PNP reaction</p>
      <p>The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and the Philippine National Police leaderships yesterday expressed support for President Duterte’s decision to fire Vice President Leni Robredo as co-chairperson of ICAD.</p>
      <p>“PDEA respects and believes in the wisdom of the President. Whatever happens, PDEA will continue to carry out its mandate to rid of the country of illegal drugs with utmost sincerity and integrity,” PDEA chair Director General Aaron N. Aquio, also Mrs. Robredo’s co-chairperson at the ICAD, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The PNP headed by its Officer-in-Charge Lieutenant General Archie Francico F. Gamboa also said it fully respects President Duterte’s decision.</p>
      <p>“The PNP respects the decision of the President terminating the services of Vice President Leni Robredo as ICAD co-chair,” PNP spokesperson Brig. Gen. Bernard Banac said.</p>
      <p>The PNP leadership also assured the public that their crackdown against ‘high-value drug targets will remain relentless following the rule of law and with utmost respect for human rights.”</p>
      <p>Guevarra ‘sad’</p>
      <p>Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra yesterday expressed “sadness” over Robredo’s removal as co-chairperson of ICAD.</p>
      <p>In a chance interview, Guevarra said that Robredo’s ICAD stint could have been a rare opportunity for the administration and opposition to join hands together in combatting illegal drugs.</p>
      <p>“Personally, I feel so sad about what happened. There was this opportunity for the administratiom and even the opposition to bond together and put up a united front against a common enemy which is illegal drugs. But you know, circumstances costs this venture to crush before it could even take fly so I feel sad about it because there was that opportunity already available, “ Guevarra said in a chance interview.</p>
