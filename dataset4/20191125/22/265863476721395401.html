      <p>Justin Bieber has a new and fun look! The singer was caught on camera rocking bubble gum pink hair while out and about in L.A. much to the excitement of fans. Check it out!</p>
      <p>Whether you like that about him or not, Justin is used to taking all kinds of risks and his hairstyle is not an exception.</p>
      <p>Regardless, this new look is still quite a massive change as it was definitely a visible departure from his usual brown locks.</p>
      <p>Besides, it’s not a naturally-occurring shade, which makes it even more fun!</p>
      <p>And that was not all! To make the new look stand out even more, Bieber put on a pair of matching pink sweatpants by Drew.</p>
      <p>Maybe now that he has pink hair, the performer sees life in a different life since he seemed to be in such a great mood when the paparazzi caught up with him.</p>
      <p>To show that he was in good spirits, Justin flashed a peace sign to the camera.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the hair is definitely not the only reason for him to feel good about life and celebrate.</p>
      <p>Speaking of, just a few days ago, his wife, model Hailey Baldwin turned 23 years old so they made sure to have a super fun party, even if they kept it low-key.</p>
      <p>Judging by the pics from the celebration that made their way to social media, it’s safe to say that it was the perfect bash filled with deserts and good vibes.</p>
      <p>In a special post for her birthday, in which he hinted at starting a family with Hailey, Justin also wrote: ‘Happy birthday babe. You make me want to be better every day! The way that you live your life is so attractive.. ps you turn me on in every way 😍😍😍😍 next season BABIES.’</p>
