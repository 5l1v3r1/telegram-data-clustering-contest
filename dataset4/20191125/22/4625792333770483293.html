      <p>The head of the Chick-fil-A Foundation is a donor to both former President Barack Obama's and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's presidential campaigns.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=rodney+bullard">records</a> from the Federal Election Commission, Rodney Bullard, the executive director of the Chick-fil-A Foundation, donated $1,000 to Hillary for America in 2016 along with $500 donations to both Obama for America and the Obama Victory Fund in 2008.</p>
      <p>Bullard helped the restaurant company start its foundation in 2011, but Chick-fil-A is now being accused of caving to liberals by ending donations from its charitable arm to Christian charities such as the Salvation Army and Fellowship of Christian Athletes.</p>
      <p>The company <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/chick-fil-a-to-end-donations-to-groups-that-oppose-gay-and-transgender-rights">announced the decision earlier</a> this month after pressure from gay rights activists, saying it wanted to clarify its beliefs and focus on education, homelessness, and hunger. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/glaad-wants-chick-fil-a-to-change-more-company-policies">Conservatives slammed the organization</a> after the move, with one Republican congressman arguing that it "bowed" to the "harassment lobby" and another sarcastically congratulating "wokescolds who finally bullied Chick-fil-A into stopping donations to the Salvation Army."</p>
      <p>The company said it is still open to donating to Christian companies in the future. The move comes after attempts to open restaurants in more <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/uk-chick-fil-a-closing-after-backlash-over-donations-to-christian-organizations">liberal markets</a> such as the U.K and Canada, where it <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/uk-chick-fil-a-closing-after-backlash-over-donations-to-christian-organizations">faced resistance</a> for its owner's Christian beliefs, including support for traditional marriage.</p>
