      <h1>Ex-Greek Orthodox Archdiocese exec accused of embezzling over $500K</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:06:57+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:06</time> by <a rel="author">Emily Saul</a></address>
      <p>The onetime executive director of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America has been busted for pocketing more than $500,000 in church funds, according to prosecutors.</p>
      <p>Jerome Dimitriou, 55, allegedly ran two separate schemes dating back to 2011, according to a Manhattan federal court complaint unsealed Monday.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors claim he charged tens of thousands of dollars in personal expenses to the diocese-issued credit card, while also instructing subordinates to cut him around $500,000 in bonus checks without proper authorization.</p>
      <p>The Green Lawn, NY, man allegedly spent the money on plane tickets, a gym membership, iTunes purchases and other items, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>“As the executive director of a non-profit religious organization, Jerome Dimitriou was supposed to serve the organization, not himself,” US Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in a statement. “As alleged, over several years, he abused his leadership position and embezzled over half a million dollars.”</p>
      <p>Dimitriou was released on $150,000 bond following an appearance Monday before a magistrate judge.</p>
      <p>Defense attorney Nathaniel Marmur said his client “has dedicated his life to the church.”</p>
      <p>“We look forward to all the facts in this matter coming to light,” Marmur added.</p>
      <p>Dimitriou is due back in court Dec. 26. He faces up to 20 years behind bars if convicted.</p>
      <p>His arrest comes less than a month after the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America’s former financial officer, George Papadakos, was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/31/greek-orthodox-church-official-gets-no-jail-sentence-for-embezzling/">sentenced to time served</a> for pilfering nearly $70,000 from the church.</p>
