      <p>We know that boutique baristas have introduced a lot of mad science when it comes to brewing, but believe us when we say there's nothing like a good pour-over coffee. As brewing methods go, it's not that complex but still not the kind of thing you can do (let's say) at the office before work.</p>
      <p>Until now. These ingenious <a href="https://store.boingboing.net/sales/season-s-sippings-bundle?utm_source=boingboing.net&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=season-s-sippings-bundle&amp;utm_term=scsf-354779&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004N0YO&amp;scsonar=1">Copper Cow Vietnamese Pour Over Coffee Sets</a> come with their own filter and condensed milk, allowing you to get a cup of the good stuff virtually anywhere.</p>
      <p>What you get is a selection of six kits, each one with a different flavored creamer. Each of five packs in the kit contains a packet of coffee or tea with a filter that unfolds and fits right over your cup. Pour a little hot water, add the creamer and bingo. You've got a delicious Vietnamese-style cup of pour-over coffee.</p>
      <p>The creamers are a highlight, made with condensed milk and sugar. They run the gamut of Copper Cows most popular flavors: Chai, Churro, Mint, Lavender, Rose or regular Cream.</p>
      <p>The sets are already priced at <a href="https://store.boingboing.net/sales/season-s-sippings-bundle?utm_source=boingboing.net&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=season-s-sippings-bundle&amp;utm_term=scsf-354779&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004N0YO&amp;scsonar=1">14% off the retail price</a>, but you can take an extra 15% off for our early Black Friday sale by using the discount code <b>BFSAVE15</b>.</p>
