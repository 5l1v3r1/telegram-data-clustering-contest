      <h1>What the Met Office says about 'coldest winter for 100 years'</h1>
      <h2>There will be snow, but where?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:00:19+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Grimshaw</a></address>
      <p>Temperatures are set to plummet as snow blizzards batter parts of the UK during the 'coldest winter for 100 years', according to experts.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/weather">Exacta Weather</a> claims the UK could see "some type of 100-year cold or snow records being breached this winter, reports the Express.</p>
      <p>But forecasters at the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/weather">Met Office</a> say their long-range predictions look very different.</p>
      <p>Experts at the authority say next month's temperature will actually be above average for this time of year.</p>
      <p>A Met Office spokesman said: "At the the moment, the longest range we are looking at is January, but this is not a forecast, it's a probability.</p>
      <p>"We're probably looking at milder than average conditions - so, not the coldest for 100 years, or a collapsed polar vortex."</p>
      <p>He said the start of December will see heavy rain in the UK, with snow on northern hills by December 5.</p>
      <p>It could then turn colder with frost and fog in the North.</p>
      <p>From December 6 to 20, more rain and strong winds are set to batter the UK, predominantly in the West.</p>
      <p>The long range forecast reads: "Snow is likely at times in the north, mainly over high ground.</p>
      <p>"Some quieter, drier, colder spells are also likely, giving night frosts and some fog.</p>
      <p>"These may occur more frequently in the north in the early part of this period but confidence for this aspect is very low.</p>
      <p>"However temperatures for the most part are expected to be near or slightly above average, for the time of year."</p>
      <p>The Met Office said the amount of snowfall experienced during December could not yet be determined.</p>
