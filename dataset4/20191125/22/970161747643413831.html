      <h1>Doctor reveals own payslip saying not all medics earn over £80,000</h1>

      <p>A doctor has hit out at a Question Time audience member who went viral by<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/man-80000-salary-refuses-believe-top-5-earners-11200959/"> insisting he was not in the top 5% of earners</a> – despite taking home £80,000.</p>
      <p>Last week Rob Barber complained about Labour’s election policy of planning a 45p rate on earnings for those on the highest salaries and said all doctors earned more than him.</p>
      <p>Now Dr Asif Munaf has shared his own salary to prove how ‘misinformed’ Mr Barber is.</p>
      <p>Tweeting a picture of his £48,075 pay slip, he wrote: ‘This guy is terribly misinformed.</p>
      <p>‘I spent 6 years at medschool and a further 7 years of specialist training and I get paid £48,000.</p>

      <p>‘He needs to #factscheck and use some of his £80,000 on a new shirt and trim.’</p>
      <p>The clip of Mr Barber provoked widespread mockery after he jabbed his finger in the air and accused Labour of lying about their proposed tax hike only affecting the top 5% of earners.</p>
      <p>The average UK salary is £29,000 and figures from the Office for National Statistics show that anyone earning more than £75,300 is in the top 5%.</p>
      <p>But Mr Barber, who is believed to be an IT consultant, even suggested that his salary was not even in ‘the top 50% of earners.’</p>

      <p>He said he did earn above the £80,000 threshold just like ‘every doctor, every accountant and every solicitor.’</p>
      <p>But official figures suggest all those professions fall below £80,000 – with a doctor on £76,000.</p>
      <p>Under Labour’s plan, Mr Barber would have to pay roughly an extra £50 for every £1,000 he earns over £80,000.</p>
