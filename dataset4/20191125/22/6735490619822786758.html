      <p>Johnny Depp has settled with lawyers he had hired for a malpractice suit.</p>
      <p>In 2017, they claimed the “Pirates of the Caribbean” star owed them $350,000 in unpaid legal fees.</p>
      <p>Depp had ended litigation with the Buckley LLP lawyers that he hired for his malpractice suit with attorney Jake Bloom, who was Depp’s lawyer for nearly 20 years.</p>

      <p>Buckley’s Fredrick Levin, Michael Rome and Ali Abugheida were suing Depp for the balance owed on his 10%-discounted $535,697.28 bill reports <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/johnny-depp-settles-lawsuit-filed-by-his-former-attorneys-1202795142/"><i>Deadline</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Next up for Depp is a $50 million defamation suit against ex-Amber Heard after she accused him of abuse and in return, Depp alleged it was the other way around.</p>
      <p>Following that, Depp will face another case on May 11, 2020, where location manager on “City of Lies”, Gregg “Rocky” Brook, claims Depp hit him “in the lower left side of his rib cage” after he told the actor that he would have to work late.</p>
