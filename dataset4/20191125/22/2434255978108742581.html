      <p>Daniel O'Donnell has opened up about the death of his mother, admitting he'd love to see her again in heaven - but he doesn't think that will happen.</p>

      <p>"But I think people who are dead, of course you don't see them physically.</p>
      <p>"They're there in your memories."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/daniel-odonnell">Daniel</a>'s mother Julia passed away at the age of 94 and the singer said that while he was very sad to lose her, she lived to a "great age".</p>

      <p>"She was very alert, she was very much involved in everything we were doing," he went on.</p>
      <p>"If she had another 20 years it would be great too. But her body just wore out.</p>
      <p>"In the latter part of her life, every day there was something small wrong with her that we could do nothing about."</p>
      <p>Speaking about religion, the star of <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/rte">Daniel and Majella's B&amp;B Road Trip</a> said he still goes to mass every Sunday.</p>
      <p>"I do try to go every weekend, Saturday night or Sunday morning," he said.</p>

      <p>"I get something out of going to mass. I want to believe that God is there, it gives me a good feeling.</p>
      <p>He added: "If you dissect it all down it's unbelievable, how did all this happen?</p>
      <p>"Mary became pregnant by the holy spirit and Jesus assumed up...If you want to poke holes in it it's very easy to.</p>
      <p>"But I get a comfort out of the idea that there's something there that helps me along the way."</p>
      <p>Daniel also paid tribute to Gay Byrne, saying he was always "gracious" and helpful to him.</p>
