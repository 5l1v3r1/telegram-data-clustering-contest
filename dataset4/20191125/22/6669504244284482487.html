      <p>Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement warning of a cold and blustery week ahead for Kamloops and the South Thompson.</p>
      <p>Colder conditions will begin tomorrow, Nov. 26, across northern and central B.C. The cold air will persist through the end of the week with temperatures in the -15 Celsius to -25 C range, <a href="https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?bc33">according to a special weather statement from Environment Canada</a>.</p>
      <p>Blustery northerly winds will accompany the arrival of the Arctic air with windchill becoming a factor tomorrow night and Wednesday, the alert says. Temperatures will also continue to drop Thursday and Friday as the Arctic air deepens over the Interior.</p>
      <p>People who work outdoors or spend time outside are reminded to dress warmly and in layers preferably with a wind-resistant outer layer. Travellers are encouraged to add winter emergency kits to their vehicles which include a blanket, extra clothes and boots.</p>
