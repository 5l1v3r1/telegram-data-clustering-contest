      <p>Research from Washington State University suggests cannabis could be used to relieve headaches, university researchers said in the Journal of Pain.</p>
      <p>According to the research, inhaled cannabis reduces self-reported headache severity by 47.3% and migraine severity by 49.6%.</p>
      <p>According to Washington State, the study was the first to use big data from headache and migraine patients using cannabis in real time.</p>
      <p>“We were motivated to do this study because a substantial number of people say they use cannabis for headache and migraine, but surprisingly few studies had addressed the topic,” said Carrie Cuttler, a Washington State University assistant professor of psychology, the lead author on the paper.</p>
      <p>Cuttler did caution that there could be a placebo effect, and that further research is needed.</p>
      <p>“I suspect there are some slight overestimates of effectiveness,” said Cuttler. “My hope is that this research will motivate researchers to take on the difficult work of conducting placebo-controlled trials. In the meantime, this at least gives medical cannabis patients and their doctors a little more information about what they might expect from using cannabis to manage these conditions.”</p>
      <p>The study also found no significant difference between the effectiveness of THC and CBD, two active ingredients in cannabis.</p>
      <p>One prior study indicated that cannabis was more effective than ibuprofen in reducing headaches, but that study used nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid drug.</p>
