      <p>The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has said it will continue its fight against internet fraudsters called “Yahoo Boys,” Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>This news medium also noted that the EFCC said it arrested over 200 Internet fraud suspects in October 2019 alone.</p>
      <p>EFCC’s acting Chairman Ibrahim Magu said this on over the weekend during an interactive session with the press in Abuja.</p>
      <p>According to him, “high-end fraudsters that they can only run, but cannot hide, sooner than later, we will get them.</p>
      <p>“The effort to flush out all fraudsters continues. At the same time, we will sustain the tempo of vigorous prosecution of fraud cases in court.</p>
      <p>“Indeed, fraudsters account for a huge percentage of the 890 convictions that has been recorded by the commission this year.</p>
      <p>“A number of assets have been seized, while victims have also enjoyed restitution by order of a court.”</p>
      <p>Magu noted that the biggest catch of the commission was an Instagram celebrity Ismaila Mustapha called Mompha and his Lebanese accomplice Hamza Koudeih.</p>
      <p>“Five wristwatches valued at over N60 million were recovered from Mompha at the point of arrest,” he added.</p>
      <p>“Investigation has also revealed that he operates 51 bank accounts in Nigeria with which he acquired properties in Dubai and had laundered about N14 billion through Ismalob Global Investments Limited.</p>
      <p>“His accomplice, Koudeih, also has two firms namely: THK Services Limited and CHK properties Limited with which he has allegedly laundered about N19 billion.</p>
      <p>“Koudeih lives in a five million dollar per annum suite at the Eko Atlantic Pearl Tower, Victoria Island Lagos.’’</p>
