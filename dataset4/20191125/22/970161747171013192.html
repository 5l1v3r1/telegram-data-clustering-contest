      <p>The Chief Rabbi has criticised Jeremy Corbyn, saying the ‘soul of the nation is at stake’ in the upcoming General Election.</p>
      <p>In an article for <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/ephraim-mirvis-what-will-become-of-jews-in-britain-if-labour-forms-the-next-government-ghpsdbljk">The Times</a>, Ephraim Mirvis criticised Jeremy Corbyn for being ‘complicit in prejudice’ and ‘unfit for office’.</p>
      <p>He added that British Jews are ‘gripped by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/anxiety/">anxiety</a>’ at the prospect of a Corbyn-led government after the December 12 poll.</p>
      <p>The Labour leadership and the party’s structures have been accused of failing to tackle complaints of anti-Semitism quickly enough since Mr Corbyn took charge and several MPs have quit the party over the issue.</p>
      <p>Mr Mirvis said people of the Jewish faith have expressed ‘justified’ concern about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Of course, the threats of the far-right and violent jihadism never go away, but the question I am most frequently asked is, “What will become of Jews and Judaism in Britain if the Labour Party forms the next government?”</p>

      <p>‘Raising concerns about anti-Jewish racism in the context of a General Election ranks among the most painful moments I have experienced since taking office.’</p>

      <p>The Chief Rabbi criticised Mr Corbyn for an ‘utterly inadequate’ response to anti-Semitism within Labour.</p>
      <p>He concluded: ‘I simply pose the question: What will the result of this election say about the moral compass of our country?</p>
      <p>‘When December 12 arrives, I ask every person to vote with their conscience. Be in no doubt, the very soul of our nation is at stake.’</p>
      <p>A Labour spokesman said: ‘Jeremy Corbyn is a lifelong campaigner against anti-Semitism and has made absolutely clear it has no place in our party and society and that no-one who engages in it does so in his name.</p>
      <p>‘A Labour government will guarantee the security of the Jewish community, defend and support the Jewish way of life, and combat rising anti-Semitism in our country and across Europe. Our race and faith manifesto sets out our policies to achieve this.’</p>
