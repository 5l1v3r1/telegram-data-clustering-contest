      <h1>Steam's top 20 new releases in October include Destiny 2 and Postal 4</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:04:53+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/anchalk/" target="_blank">Andy Chalk</a></address>
      <p>With November's halfway point now well behind us, Valve has released its list of the top 20 new game releases for October. Some of them, like <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/destiny-2-shadowkeep-review/">Destiny 2</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/disco-elysium/">Disco Elysium</a>, won't surprise anyone; but others, well, they might.</p>
      <p>The list is based on revenue generation over the first two weeks, which is why these rundowns never appear until a few weeks after the end of the month: Games released at the end of the month still need their two weeks to ring up the revenues, after all. And they are ranked chronologically, not by revenue, so there's no "winner" here, although it's probably safe to assume that Destiny 2 pulled in more bucks than, say, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/postal-4-no-regerts/">Postal 4: No Regerts</a>.</p>
      <p>And yes, Postal 4 is on the list, with a peak player count of 806, according to Steam Charts, which puts it just behind <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/chernobylite/">Chernobylite</a>, which managed 809. That's not directly correlated to the revenues-based ranking, since different games have different prices, but it does underscore that a game doesn't have to be a hit (or, you know, good) to make the top 20.</p>
      <p>Because it's Valve, simply listing the games isn't sufficient, so for October it dug into how many people are playing more than one game on the list. Unsurprisingly, Destiny 2 has huge overlap—nearly 20 percent of Steam users who played other games on this month's list also play Destiny 2—but there's community crossover beyond that obvious mega-hit.</p>
      <p>"While the numbers are not as high, the overlap in people playing more than one game from the Top Releases list presents some interesting correlations worth highlighting. For example, we found a lot of players enjoying both Atelier Ryza &amp; Indivisible, which are both anime RPGs featuring turn-based combat and female protagonists," Valve explained.</p>
      <p>"We found similar overlap in players across We Were Here Together and Trine 4, which both incorporate heavy use of puzzles with an emphasis on cooperative gameplay. Crossroads Inn &amp; Autonauts have very different themes, but both games utilize building and simulation."</p>
      <p>Here's the full list:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Destiny 2</li>
        <li>Indivisible</li>
        <li>Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince</li>
        <li>Doraemon Story of Seasons</li>
        <li>Mistover</li>
        <li>GRID</li>
        <li>Pine</li>
        <li>We Were Here Together</li>
        <li>Postal 4: No Regerts</li>
        <li>Chernobylite</li>
        <li>Disco Elysium</li>
        <li>The Jackbox Party Pack 6</li>
        <li>ArcheAge: Unchained</li>
        <li>Autonauts</li>
