      <h1>Prince Andrew exiled from Buckingham Palace after Prince William stepped in</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:11:39+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/kate-halfpenny/" target="_blank">Kate Halfpenny</a></address>
      <p>Prince William had a central role in <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/11/18/prince-andrew-loses-spin-doctor/">Prince Andrew’s exile from Buckingham Palace</a> after his disastrous BBC interview about links to Jeffrey Epstein, it has been reported.</p>
      <p>And the Queen has replaced a 60th birthday party planned for <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/11/19/prince-andrew-never-partied/">Andrew</a> in February with a small family dinner as an investigation into the Duke of York’s finances is said to be kicking off.</p>
      <p>Andrew, 59, was given his <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/11/21/queen-unity-prince-andrew/">marching orders from his offices</a> at the palace after he was criticised for bizarre answers and not showing empathy with <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/people-entertainment/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-epstein-bbc-interview/">alleged Jeffrey Epstein victims on </a><i>Newsnight.</i></p>
      <p>Future heir William, 37, “is becoming more and more involved in decisions about the institution (monarchy) and he’s not a huge fan of his Uncle Andrew,” a source told <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/fbi-seeks-to-interview-prince-andrew-over-jeffrey-epstein-qs2zsprsb"><i>The Times</i> </a>of London.</p>
      <p>Another source also told the paper, “William thinks the right thing happened.”</p>

      <p>With the public and his family distancing themselves, the duke is “absolutely finished,” said royal biographer Penny Junor.</p>
      <p>“If Andrew is no longer representing or supporting the monarch in any capacity, or doing good charitably, what’s the point of him?” Ms Junor said.</p>
      <p>Amid claims a <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/royal/2019/11/21/prince-andrew-subpoena-imminent/">subpoena for Andrew to testify under oath</a> to US authorities about Epstein is “imminent”, Prince Charles, 71, is also said to have been involved with the decision to send his brother packing.</p>
      <p>But the Queen, 93, is “privately supporting” Andrew.</p>
      <p>The pair were seen <a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a29890578/queen-elizabeth-shows-support-for-prince-andrew-after-he-steps-back-from-royal-duties/">riding together at Windsor</a> last week, although reports say while the Queen urged her family to stand with Andrew, she feels “aggrieved” at claims she gave permission for his interview.</p>
      <p>The monarch feels “hoodwinked” by what the duke said on air.</p>

      <p>“There is no way the Queen and her private secretary wrote a ‘yes’ on a memo that fully explained what was proposed,” a source told <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-life-and-times-of-prince-andrew-born-to-be-spare-hgq5h96rv"><i>The Times</i></a>.</p>
      <p>They claimed Andrew had “a son-to-mother conversation” to say he was addressing the Epstein controversy but didn’t go into detail.</p>
      <p>The only family member to show public support for Andrew has been his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson.</p>
      <p>She took to social media to say she is “deeply supportive and proud of this giant of a principled man”.</p>
      <p>Meghan Markle is said to have been “troubled” by her husband Prince Harry’s uncle’s remark to the BCC that “if you’re a man it’s a positive act to have sex with somebody”.</p>
      <p>There are reports Princess Beatrice is scaling back plans for a traditional royal wedding next year given her father’s fall from grace.</p>
      <p>She is said to be “in tears every day” over the fallout from Andrew’s BBC sit down <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7718663/Princess-Beatrice-helped-set-father-Prince-Andrews-car-crash-BBC-interview.html">because she encouraged it</a>.</p>
      <p>Beatrice, 31, initially “had her doubts” but met the <i>Newsnight</i> team before the duke’s interview and was convinced his participation “was the only way to put all the rumours behind them,” a source told the <i>Mail on Sunday.</i></p>

      <p>Princess Eugenie’s charity, the <a href="https://theantislaverycollective.org/">Anti-Slavery Collective</a>, has also been affected by her father’s interview, according to <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i>.</p>
      <p>On November 22, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5IODKTIuuV/">a photo posted to Instagram</a> of Eugenie, 29, her mother Sarah and Nepalese activist Anuradha Koirala drew savage comments.</p>
      <p>One said the princess’s chosen cause is ironic given her father’s friendship with Epstein, an accused child sex trafficker.</p>
      <p>It is understood the crisis engulfing the duke has seen the charity scale back its activities.</p>
      <p>“This has been terrible for the children,” a source said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Andrew is facing calls for his <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/wp-admin/post.php?post=1068920&amp;action=edit">private and business finances</a> to be scrutinised by the UK Parliament’s powerful finance watchdog, according to the <i>Telegraph.</i></p>
      <p>Revelations the Prince gets a two per cut for three years of any investment deal struck by his Pitch@Palace business venture have raised serious questions, according to former MPs.</p>
      <p>The news came after sponsors including the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the English National Ballet and the Outward Bound Trust withdrew sponsorship from Pitch@Palace.</p>
      <p>There is more scrutiny ahead for Andrew, with <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/11/10/prince-andrew-epstein-jail/">Virginia Roberts Giuffre</a> giving an interview to the BBC’s <i>Panorama</i> next week.</p>
      <p>Ms Giuffre, now 39, has said she was forced to have sex with the prince three times when she was 17.</p>
