      <p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/sugarfina-8-nights-light-candy-box-for-hanukkah-46732262">Hanukkah</a> has got to be my favorite Jewish holiday when it comes to the food. It's a time when we celebrate the victory of the Jewish people over the Greek army, and the recapturing of the Holy Temple. The connection is there was only enough oil to light the menorah in the Temple for one day, yet it lasted eight, a miraculous event. Because of this, the cuisine of the celebration is also oil-based. There are <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Latke-Recipes-39150848">latkes</a>, or shredded potatoes fried in patty form, and the oh so glorious <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Doughnuts">doughnut</a>, a pastry so clutch it can even pass as breakfast.</p>
      <p>These days, doughnuts come in all different shapes, fluorescent colors, flavors, and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Costco-Giant-Pink-Icing-Doughnut-MM-46283776">sizes</a>, and even though you may be used to picking up a dozen at your <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Best-Doughnut-Shops-44114469">favorite shop</a>, they actually can be easy enough to make at home (and so much more fun!). Keep reading to check out some of the most delectable recipes from around the internet that will have you salivating before you can even shut your laptop and get cooking.</p>

      <p>Let's start with the OG of the class. This powdered jelly doughnut, or sufganiyah as it's typically known in Israel and other more observant circles, is a staple this time of year. You can easily make it at home, but it'll look so professional you'll totally throw off your friends. Use any kind of jelly you want, or mix it up by filling with different creams and glazes.</p>
