      <p>I’m a Celebrity’s Caitlyn Jenner could find herself in serious trouble after bringing back food from the luxury roast dinner back into camp.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old reality star was seen dining with nine of the 12 campers, with Ian Wright, Cliff Parisi and Andy Whyment missing out on the banquet after Roman Kemp and James Haskell failed to get the stars during an ‘impossible’ live Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>Arriving back in camp after the dinner, Caitlyn went over to Ian, who was moping in his hammock.</p>
      <p>She then pulled a corn on the cob and some chicken from her pocket, sliding them to Ian who, after becoming known for being ‘hangry’ throughout camp, wolfed it down.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t think you’ve got any I defy you lot to find any!.’</p>

      <p>But while it was certainly a good deed from Caitlyn, it may well be a case of no good deed goes unpunished, as part of the task terms were only those whose stars were won could eat the luxury food.</p>

      <p>‘I thought it was a mirage. I can’t help but think about Ian, Cliff and Andy, but I also can’t help but think about cauliflower cheese.,’ he joked to the Bush Telegraph.</p>
      <p>‘The whole thing feels tainted,’ he later added. ‘I feel just awful. But I also can’t stop eating.’</p>
      <p>Tonight’s episode was an emotional one with all 12 campers getting care packages from home – including treats and notes from their loved ones.</p>
