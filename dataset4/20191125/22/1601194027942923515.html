      <p>During his recent appearance on The Ariel Helwani Show, former <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/ufc">UFC</a> Middleweight Champion <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/luke-rockhold">Luke Rockhold</a> briefly opened up on his current hiatus from Octagon competition and why he has decided to take a hiatus from fighting.</p>
      <h3>Luke Rockhold's last fight in the UFC</h3>
      <p>In December of 2018, Luke Rockhold announced that he would be moving up to the UFC Light Heavyweight Division after struggling to cut weight in Middleweight. Upon his debut at Light Heavyweight, Rockhold faced Polish hard-hitter <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/jan-blachowicz">Jan Blachowicz</a> at UFC 239 and ended up losing the fight via a second-round knockout.</p>
      <h3>Rockhold opens up on his current hiatus</h3>
      <p>Since suffering a gruesome loss to Blachowicz at UFC 239, former UFC Middleweight Champion Luke Rockhold stepped away from active Octagon competition, as he announced his hiatus from fighting.</p>
      <p>Rockhold opened up on this particular topic on Ariel Helwani's show, as he stated that fighting only takes away a lot from a fighter's life and claimed that it is indeed nice for the former UFC Middleweight Champion to take a break from it.</p>
