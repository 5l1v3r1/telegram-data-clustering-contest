        <b>HEARTS have made their move to convince Daniel Stendel to join them instead of waiting for a job in England.</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>SunSport</i> understands the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14918/hearts/">Jambos</a> held talks with the German at the weekend.</p>

      <p>We told last week how the ex-Barnsley boss was the new favourite for the Tynecastle hot seat.</p>
      <p>But it became clear Ann Budge would have to push the boat out to tempt Stendel because of his preference to remain down south.</p>
      <p>It is thought Budge has now made her pitch to Stendel having already spoken to Stuart McCall, Alan Irvine, Neil McCann and Steve Cotterill.</p>
      <p>Stendel, 45, was axed as Tykes boss last month.</p>
      <p>He’s under contract with them until the end of the season and must agree a severance package or Hearts may have to pay compensation</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4991155/hearts-michael-smith-relegation/">Michael Smith has told his team-mates to toughen up mentally</a> if they want to escape a relegation dogfight.</p>
      <p>The<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4988193/kilmarnock-3-hearts-0-austin-macphee/"> Tynecastle side’s crushing 3-0 loss at Rugby Park</a> left them just one point above bottom place, however, with St Johnstone drawing with Aberdeen there's now four teams level on 11 points.</p>
      <p>Yet it was not so much the defeat, but the pitiful manner of it that has alarm bells ringing for Smith.</p>
      <p>The Northern Ireland international reckons too many players felt they just had to turn up to collect the points, but they were in for a rude awakening.</p>
      <p>Three goals inside seven extraordinary minutes at the start of the match brought Hearts crashing back to earth after their 5-2 win against St Mirren.</p>
