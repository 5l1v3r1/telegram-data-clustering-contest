      <p>Air travel could be snarled heading into Thanksgiving thanks to a large snowstorm poised to sweep across the country on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
      <p>As a result, United and Delta have both announced waivers for some travelers impacted by this week's storm. The waivers allow travelers to rebook their flight without penalty.</p>
      <p>Adding insult to injury, a second storm could toil with travelers following the holiday.</p>
      <p>According to the National Weather Service, nearly a foot of snow is expected to fall in Denver, which is a major hub for United Airlines. The National Weather Service also cautioned drivers who will use Interstates 70, 26 and 76.</p>
      <p>United Airlines announced on Sunday travel waivers for those departing from Denver now through Nov. 29.</p>
      <p>The pre-Thanksgiving storm is then expected to travel north, where 5-7 inches of snow are expected around Minneapolis. Minneapolis is a major hub for Delta.</p>
      <p>Delta announced late Monday waivers for those flying out of Minneapolis.</p>
      <p>Although snow is expected to stay well to the north and west, Chicago, Indianapolis, Detroit and Cincinnati are expecting an extreme wind event. Much of the Midwest was placed under a high wind watch for Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Another storm is expected to sweep across the Rockies and Upper Midwest on Friday and Saturday, but it is too early to predict the amount of snow.</p>
