      <p>The I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! camp mates were treated to care packages from home thanks to the heroics of four stars.</p>
      <p>Kate Garraway, Nadine Coyle, Myles Stephenson and Andy Whyment were tasked with retrieving the 12 care packages from the Australian bush, with each celebrity responsible for three packages.</p>
      <p>They were whisked away in a helicopter and given two hours to complete the challenge.</p>

      <p>The first task required the quartet to pair up and abseil down a rocky cliff edge to retrieve the first four packages. Coyle played for Adele Roberts, Garraway chose James Haskell and Stephenson was responsible for Andrew Maxwell’s package.</p>
      <p>Whyment decided to go for Ian Wright’s.</p>
      <p>A worried Coyle confessed to being scared of heights as she controlled the ropes allowing Garraway to make her way down the cliff to successfully retrieve the first package.</p>
      <p>A squealing Coyle was next, followed by Stephenson and Whyment.</p>
      <p>“It could have gone horribly wrong but luckily we made it down,” said Stephenson.</p>
      <p>Next, the four celebrities arrived at a crossroads and again had to pair up before heading in separate directions.</p>
      <p>Whyment and Garraway went one way while Coyle and Stephenson went the other.</p>

      <p>The first pair reached a creek and found a map and walkie talkie, while the other pair found themselves in a field with two spades and another walkie talkie.</p>
      <p>It spluttered into action and they heard Garraway on the other end. Using a compass, she had to direct Coyle and Stephenson to where she thought four of the care packages were hidden.</p>
      <p>After a few attempts, they found Caitlyn Jenner’s care package, followed by those belonging to Cliff Parisi, Jacqueline Jossa and Roman Kemp, leaving them free to move on to the next challenge.</p>
      <p>The four celebrities had 25 minutes left to complete their tasks.</p>
      <p>A letter instructed them that each had to walk along a wire suspended over a river to retrieve the final four packages.</p>
      <p>The only remaining packages were their own.</p>

      <p>Garraway went first and gingerly walked towards the package suspended above her head, before grabbing it and falling into the water, victorious.</p>
      <p>Coyle went next and easily retrieved her package. After Whyment grabbed his, Stephenson was left with four minutes to do the same.</p>
      <p>Following a wobble, he finally reached the package, meaning all 12 had been retrieved.</p>
      <p>The triumphant quartet returned to the camp and the celebrities read each other’s notes from home, while also looking at family pictures and eating food treats.</p>

      <p>It comes as the opening episode of the new series of I’m A Celebrity became the most watched programme of 2019, according to ITV.</p>
      <p>An average audience of more than 13 million tuned in to watch this year’s camp mates arrive in the jungle, roughly half a million more than an episode of the BBC’s Line Of Duty, which attracted 12.6 million viewers in May.</p>
      <p>I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! continues on ITV.</p>
