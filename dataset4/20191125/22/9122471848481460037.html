      <h1>Darren Rovell Has An Update On Willie Taggart’s Contract Situation With Florida State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:15:24+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Florida State parted ways with head coach Willie Taggart earlier this season after less than two years on the job. In doing so, it seemed they were willing to pay his gargantuan buyout.</p>
      <p>However, earlier today, a story from Matt Baker of the <i>Tampa Bay Times</i> stated that <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/sports/seminoles/2019/11/25/willie-taggart-never-signed-a-final-contract-heres-why-it-could-matter/">Taggart and Florida State never actually signed an official contract.</a> As a result, there looked like a possible way for the school to get out of the $18 million it owed him.</p>
      <p>Now, a new report from Action Network’s Darren Rovell claims Taggart actually signed his contract with FSU, but the school did not. Rovell says Taggart should get his money.</p>

      <p>Taggart would have fought for his money whether or not he signed a contract. If Rovell’s reporting is accurate, he doesn’t have to battle because he’ll be getting it.</p>
      <p>Florida State has yet to hire a new coach, but the Seminoles have won two games in a row under interim head coach Odell Haggins. At 6-5, they have clinched bowl eligibility after missing out on a bowl last season.</p>
      <p>The Seminoles will face rival Florida in the regular season finale on Saturday. Florida won last year’s matchup after FSU beat the Gators five times in a row from 2013-17.</p>
