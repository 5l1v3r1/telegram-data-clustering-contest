      <p>Two anti- <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> campaigners have claimed they were pulled over on the M25 and told by police to remove a sticker from their car.</p>
      <p>Passenger Peter Cook posted a video to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> claiming that Essex Police had "bullied" the campaigners into removing a "Bollocks to Brexit" slogan on the motorway near Brentwood on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Mr Cook told the BBC: "He said it [the slogan] was a public order offence, he insisted we remove the signage on the hard shoulder of the M25."</p>
      <p>Posting a video of the incident on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/social-media">social media</a> , the campaign group said: "Essex Police bullied us into removing "Bollocks" from our car... I am calling the Police Complaints Commission."</p>
      <p>An Essex Police spokeswoman said: "We are trying to identify the officer from the video footage to establish the circumstances around what happened.</p>
      <p>"In the meantime, we would encourage the driver to get in touch with us."</p>
      <p>The Independent Office for Police Conduct did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>In November 1977, Nottingham Magistrates' Court ruled "bollocks" was not an obscene word after a record store manager was arrested for displaying the album Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols.</p>
