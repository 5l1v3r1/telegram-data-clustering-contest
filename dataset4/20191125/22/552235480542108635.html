      <h1>Greens manifesto demands Scottish independence referendum before Brexit</h1>
      <h2>Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said voters should be able to choose independence in the EU before Brexit takes Britain out.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:02:07+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:02</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Philip, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/andy-philip/</a></address>
      <p>The Scottish Greens have backed calls for another independence referendum next year - before Scotland is taken out of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brexit-1">EU</a> .</p>
      <p>Party leader Patrick Harvie said it would be a “mistake” to wait until <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/boxing-battler-boris-johnson-really-20918613">Boris</a> Johnson’s proposed one-year transition period runs out after formally leaving on January 31.</p>
      <p>The position, announced in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-green-party">Greens</a> ’ manifesto on Monday, puts the party in line with SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon.</p>
      <p>Harvie said: “Scotland didn't vote for Brexit, Scotland certainly didn't vote - I actually think almost nobody in the UK voted - for the hard Brexit cliff-edge that's being promised by Boris Johnson outside of the single market and outside the customs union, the abolition of a great many of our rights and protections and a deregulation agenda.”</p>
      <p>He said the position was not agreed with the SNP before being written into their manifesto.</p>
      <p>Greens are only standing in 20 constituencies in Scotland and the first-past-the-post system stacks the odds heavily against party candidates.</p>
      <p>But their manifesto promises to demand “climate action” from government. Harvie said voters who can’t back Greens should insist other parties go further on the environment.</p>
      <p>Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard meanwhile insisted the current SNP-Green majority for independence at Holyrood is “no mandate” for a second vote.</p>
      <p>But he suggested the SNP could still get one with support from the Greens after 2021.</p>
      <p>"If the SNP or other parties put in their manifesto that they wanted to hold a second independence referendum and they got a mandate for that, either 2021, 2026 or at some future point, then of course what we're saying is that that would not be blocked by a UK Labour Westminster government,” he said.</p>
      <p>Scots Tory interim leader Jackson Carlaw said: “This confirms Richard Leonard has fallen into line with Jeremy Corbyn in opening the door for a second independence referendum."</p>
