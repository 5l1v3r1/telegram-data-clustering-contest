      <h1>Richard Jefferson’s viral Knicks jab was all a hoax</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:39:48+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:39</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Fischer</a></address>
      <p>It turns out Richard Jefferson was only trolling the Knicks when he said Sunday night that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/richard-jefferson-chose-retirement-over-playing-for-knicks/">he chose to retire in 2018 rather than play for the struggling franchise.</a></p>
      <p>“For clarification purposes, it is not true that the New York Knicks offered Richard Jefferson a contract in either the summer of 2018 or 2019,” the Knicks’ public relations team <a href="https://twitter.com/NY_KnicksPR/status/1199085493532708865?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">tweeted Monday.</a></p>
      <p>Jefferson said on YES during the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/nets-hold-off-knicks-in-dramatic-closing-moments/">Nets’ win over the Knicks</a> that he knew it was time to retire once when the Knicks — who have missed the playoffs the past six seasons — were the only team to offer him a contract.</p>
      <p>“When the Knicks were looking for me to play for them, I knew my time in the league was over,” the former Nets star said.</p>
      <p>Jefferson, who is an NBA pundit for YES and ESPN, attempted to clarify he was joking by responding to a viral clip of his comments later in the game.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the 39-year-old former small forward replied to the Knicks’ tweet, <a href="https://twitter.com/Rjeff24/status/1199088813567610892?s=20">“2020 here we come #comeback,”</a> along with a laughing emoji.</p>
