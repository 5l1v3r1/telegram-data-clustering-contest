      <h1>Why the LiveTiles share price is one to watch today</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:17:55+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/kennethhallau/" target="_blank">Kenneth Hall</a></address>
      <p>The <b>LiveTiles Ltd </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-LVT/">(ASX: LVT)</a> share price will be one to watch on the ASX this morning ahead of the company’s annual general meeting (AGM).</p>
      <h3>Why is the LiveTiles share price on watch?</h3>
      <p>The Aussie software company has had a busy FY 2019 as the company continues to expand.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/20/livetiles-announces-19-million-acquisition-of-cycl/">LiveTiles announced last Wednesday</a> that it would be acquiring Swiss intranet provider, CYCL. The Swiss company has 2 software products, Condense and MatchPoint, with 10 active reseller partners.</p>
      <p>CYCL currently serves 156 high-quality customers and generates total revenue of $14.1 million. Its annualised recurring revenue (ARR) currently stands at $4.7 million.</p>
      <p>LiveTiles also noted the close alignment with <b>Microsoft</b> and very high customer retention as key points of the acquisition.</p>
      <p>The Aussie software group’s addressable market remains large with 300,000 potential customers, according to today’s AGM presentation.</p>
      <p>With an average ARR of $43,600 per customer, LiveTiles is estimating each 1% of market penetration is worth $130 million in ARR.</p>
      <p>The LiveTiles share price will be one to watch when the market opens up for trade this morning following the presentation.</p>
      <p>LiveTiles saw strong growth in Microsoft Office365 Commercial revenue, which climbed 34% higher on the prior corresponding period (pcp).</p>
      <p>The Aussie software group is more than 4 times larger than its nearest competitor on a global scale on a revenue basis.</p>
      <p>The company’s ARR growth for FY 2019 came in at 167% total and 114% organic. The inorganic growth came from LiveTiles’ acquisition of Wizdom, a leading European ‘plug and play’ business in February 2019.</p>
      <p>This strong FY19 result continued the company’s strong growth trajectory. A higher proportion of new enterprise customers and product cross-selling also boosted average ARR per customer.</p>
      <p>On the cash flow front, LiveTiles recorded strong growth in customer cash receipts across all 4 quarters in FY19. Net operating cash flow also improved throughout the year in a boost for the LiveTiles share price.</p>
