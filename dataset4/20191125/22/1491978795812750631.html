        <i>• Fast bowler reports racist abuse from spectator in first Test<br/>• Giles: ‘There is no place for racism in the game’</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ashley-giles">Ashley Giles</a> says England’s players will rally round an “emotional and hurt” Jofra Archer after the fast bowler reported racist abuse from a spectator during the defeat by New Zealand in the first Test in Mount Maunganui.</p>
      <p>Archer tweeted after the defeat: “A bit disturbing hearing racial insults today whilst battling to help save my team, the crowd was been amazing this week except for that one guy, @TheBarmyArmy was good as usual also.”</p>
      <p>The alleged incident took place as Archer walked back to the pavilion after being dismissed for 30 during England’s failed attempt to save the Test. Joe Root’s side subsided to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/25/england-resistance-ends-as-new-zealand-wrap-up-crushing-first-test-win">an innings-and</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/25/england-resistance-ends-as-new-zealand-wrap-up-crushing-first-test-win">-65-run defeat</a> that puts the tourists 1-0 down in the two-match series.</p>
      <p>In a previous tweet, subsequently deleted, Archer further outlined the nature of the abuse, posting: “Can the guy that was yelling bbc and bc from the scoreboard area today come forward and tell me what those words mean please? Because I don’t.”</p>
      <p>Speaking at the team hotel the following morning, England’s team director, Giles, said: “The tweet that went out was obviously emotional. It hurts. We fully support Jof – there is no place for racism in the game and Jof is part of our team. Whatever the abuse, we’re right behind him.</p>
      <p>“Our team will rally round him but it’s a serious incident. He’s a young man making his way in the game and we don’t need this sort of thing. I’m hopeful they will find out who did it. It’s a good series and played in the right fashion and one person should not ruin that but it’s a shame that sort of thing is still in society.”</p>
      <p>Archer told a steward at the time of the incident, although the England players and coaching staff are understood to have been caught unawares by Archer’s tweet that evening. Giles did claim that the 24-year-old had also informed the team’s head of security on tour, Sam Dickason, after the incident.</p>
