      <h1>David Villa backs Man City for Champions League due to Pep Guardiola 'obsession'</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: David Villa was part of the Barcelona side that Pep Guardiola led to Champions League glory in 2011, his last success in the competition</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>David Villa knows just how much the Champions League means to Pep Guardiola.</p>
      <p>Villa won Europe’s top club compeition under Guardiola at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> , scoring in their 3-1 triumph over <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> at Wembley in 2011.</p>
      <p>That was Guardiola’s last triumph in the Champions League, having failed to lift the trophy in three seasons at both Bayern Munich and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
      <p>At an awards dinner in Manchester on Sunday, Guardiola gazed longingly at the Champions League silverware on show next to him, referring to it as “my trophy” during a speech.</p>
      <p>Guardiola then jokingly suggested to Jurgen Klopp that the pair could swap their Premier League and Champions League prizes, to ensure they get their hands on the one they covet most.</p>

      <p>Villa reckons winning the Champions League has become an “obsession” for City and is convinced Guardiola, whose side need a point against Shakhtar Donetsk to qualify for the last 16, is still the man to lead them to European glory.</p>
      <p>“For all the coaches and all the big clubs, it’s normal to focus on the Champions League, because it’s the best tournament you can play with a club,” said Villa.</p>
      <p>“Pep is obviously one of the best coaches in the world and obviously the subject of his focus is to win all the trophies.</p>
      <p>“Manchester City have never won this trophy, they’ve been behind in terms of it for many years, so it’s normal they have a big obsession with this kind of trophy.</p>

      <p>“It’s the best tournament you can play as a soccer player, but it’s difficult to win for everyone, not just one or two clubs.</p>
      <p>“It’s very difficult to win, and obviously you need to do a lot of work to win it.</p>
      <p>“I’m not surprised by Pep’s success in England, because he’s a great coach. I was with him for two fantastic years at Barcelona and he helped me a lot.</p>
      <p>“He will have success wherever he goes. He managed in Spain and was successful, the same in Germany, and now in England.</p>
      <p>“So wherever he manages, he will be successful, because he’s such an amazing coach.”</p>

      <p>Villa will retire in January, following a glittering career which has taken in spells at Valencia, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, New York City FC and current club Vissel Kobe in Japan.</p>
      <p>The 37-year-old was one of the best strikers on the planet at his peak and singled out England and City winger Raheem Sterling as one of the most accomplished forwards in the world currently</p>
      <p>“He’s amazing player, with qualities it’s difficult to find in any other player,” said Villa.</p>
      <p>“He’s fast, he’s really good in one-on-ones, and this year he’s scoring a lot of goals.</p>
      <p>“He’s improving year by year, which is the most important thing for a soccer player.</p>

      <p>“When you’re 18, 19, 20, and playing at the highest level, for teams like <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and City, the most important thing is to get better every year.</p>
      <p>“It’s important to grow as a player and every year Sterling has done it. You see he’s a better player day by day, year by year, and he’s still very young.”</p>
      <p>On his decision to retire, Villa, who won Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup with Spain, said: “I knew this day would arrive. I think it’s the perfect moment and I’m happy to take this decision.</p>
      <p>“It’s not a decision I made in two or three hours. I spent a lot of time talking, making sure it was the right time, the right moment to finish.”</p>
