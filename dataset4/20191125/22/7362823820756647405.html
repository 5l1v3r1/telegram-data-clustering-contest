      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/fergie-talks-about-her-gifted-body-dishes-on-co-parenting-with-josh-duhamel-and-the-four">Fergie</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/josh-duhamel-reveals-he-wants-to-find-someone-young-enough-to-have-kids-with-after-fergie-split">Josh Duhamel</a> have finalized their divorce, according to a new report.</p>
      <p>Per <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1046197/fergie-files-for-divorce-from-josh-duhamel-almost-2-years-after-separation">E! News</a>, the onetime A-list couple is finally done with their amicable split, two years after they separated -- and just five months after the former Black Eyed Peas singer officially moved to dissolve her marriage to Duhamel.</p>
      <p>The outlet reported Monday that the “Four” host and the “Transformers” franchise star finalized their divorce on Friday at a courthouse in Pasadena, Calif. after eight years of marriage and that the former couple took a strategic approach to ending their nuptials.</p>

      <p>"They took their time figuring things out and making sure this was the right decision," an insider told E! News. "They had a long separation to see if there was any chance of things changing. Over time, it became clear that they had made the right decision and that it was time to move on."</p>

      <p>Despite their separation nearly two years ago, Duhamel, 47, and Fergie, 44, have remained steadfast in co-parenting their 6-year-old son, Axl Jack Duhamel, in the best possible way they can, with Fergie <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/fergie-talks-about-her-gifted-body-dishes-on-co-parenting-with-josh-duhamel-and-the-four">telling Fox News</a> in June 2018, “Josh makes it really easy for all of us to spend time with Axl, and Axl loves his dad so, so much."</p>

      <p>“I was pissed off at Draymond Green, first of all. I think he owed her an apology," he added. "I thought he was kind of a prick. Just because he knew the camera was on him, and he snickered about. I just thought that, if he would have been a real man, he would have at least called her and said, ‘Listen, I’m sorry that I caused all this.’ … That’s what a real man would have done, in my opinion.”</p>
