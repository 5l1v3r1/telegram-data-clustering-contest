      <h1>BMW M135i shown again in Storm Bay Blue – Photo Gallery</h1>
      <h2>With the market launch of the new VW Golf 8 in December 2019, the cards in the compact class are being reshuffled. The undisputed best-seller …</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:09:29+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:09</time> by <a rel="author">Horatiu Boeriu</a></address>
      <p>As part of the local presentation, BMW Bulgaria revealed a new photo gallery of the <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/09/10/2019-iaa-bmw-m135i-xdrive-shines-in-storm-bay/">BMW M135i painted in Storm Bay Blue Metallic</a>. In the photos, we see the top model of the third generation in a Fall setting and seeing what it looks like under different light conditions. The Storm Bay Blue costs an additional 1,200 euros and is more expensive than the other metallic finishes priced at 700 euros.</p>
      <p>The accents in Cerium Gray, which are reserved for the M135i top-of-the-line model, further differentiate the car from the rest of the lineup. In addition to the M135i-specific mesh kidney, the exterior mirrors, elements of the outer air intakes in the front apron and the tailpipe covers in Cerium Gray are also also unique to the model.</p>

      <p>If you prefer black, you can grab the M Performance package in the case of the M135i and then, in addition to lighter forged wheels, also get a Shadow Line that replaces all Cerium Gray-painted elements.</p>
      <p>Using the front-wheel drive architecture from BMW, the new hot hatch is still sending power to all four wheels, but this time, from a 2.0 liter four-cylinder turbo engine. This engine is the BMW Group’s most powerful four-cylinder engine, extracting 225 kW (306 hp) between 5,000 and 6,250 rpm and has a peak torque of 450 Nm (332 lb-ft) 1,750 rpm and stays there up to 4,500 rpm. The flagship model races to 100 km/h (62 mph) from rest in just 4.8 seconds (4.7 seconds with M Performance package), while top speed is limited to 250 km/h (155 mph).</p>

      <p>The M Sport model and standard specification for the BMW M135i xDrive include the M Sport steering wheel and the Trigon/Sensatec sports seats in Black. This upholstery variant is enhanced with special BMW M piping and contrast blue stitching. For the sports seats, the Dakota leather is available in Black, Black with blue highlights and Magma Red with grey highlights.</p>

      <p>And BMW 1 Series customers can now order the M Sport model and BMW M135i xDrive with M Sport seats featuring an integral head restraint and extendable seat cushion. These are also available with upholstery in Trigon cloth and Alcantara, as well as Dakota leather in Black and Magma Red.</p>
      <p>In Europe, the BMW M135i xDrive is available only with an automatic gearbox, starting at 48,900 Euros.</p>
