      <p>President Donald Trump apparently isn’t bothered by his personal lawyer hinting at having damaging information in case Trump decides to chuck him under the bus.</p>
      <p>“What do you think of Rudy Giuliani saying he has ‘insurance?'” a reporter asked Monday during a media scrum in the Oval Office.</p>
      <p>“Oh, I don’t know,” Trump replied. “Rudy’s a great guy.”</p>
      <p>The President went on to say that Giuliani “covered that himself,” likely referring to the lawyer <a href="https://twitter.com/RudyGiuliani/status/1198352974000644097">claiming</a> on Saturday that he was being sarcastic when he told Fox News host Ed Henry he had “insurance” earlier that day.</p>
      <p>That wasn’t the first time Giuliani alluded to having some kind of safeguard in the event Trump and his allies make him take the fall for the scheme to strong-arm Ukraine into announcing an investigation into Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>During an interview with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/14/rudy-giuliani-donald-trump-insurance-loyal?CMP=share_btn_tw">Guardian</a> more than a week ago, Giuliani said he wasn’t worried about Trump potentially throwing him under the bus as House impeachment investigators dig into the scandal.</p>
      <p>“But I do have very, very good insurance, so if he does, all my hospital bills will be paid,” Giuliani told the Guardian.</p>
      <p>“He’s joking,” Giuliani’s attorney added.</p>
      <p>And in September, Giuliani told <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/26/politics/giuliani-denies-charges-whistleblower-complaint-ukraine/index.html">CNN</a> he had kept several texts from the State Department as proof that the department had approved of his communications with Ukraine.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to use them to protect myself if and when I need them,” he said.</p>
