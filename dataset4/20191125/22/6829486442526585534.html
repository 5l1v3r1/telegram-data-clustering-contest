      <h1>Bon Iver Just Announced A Stack Of Australian Tour Dates</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:00:11+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>Bon Iver has come a long way from the insular sadness of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Emma,_Forever_Ago"><i>For Emma, Forever Ago</i></a>.</p>
      <p>That record, which put the band on the map, was <a href="https://junkee.com/ten-best-songs-listen-rains/99626">a chronicle of loneliness and heartbreak</a> which became something of a cross-over success. But Justin Vernon, the musician at the centre of the group, never again tried to replicate its spider-like textures. Instead, he went weird, crafting record after record that brushed up more against hip hop stylings than confessional folk.</p>
      <p>All of that culminated in 2019’s <i>I, I</i> (that’s “I comma I” if you ever have to say it out loud), one of the glittering jewels in the band’s career. Weird, wormy and gnostic, the thing garnered some of the best reviews that Bon Iver have ever gotten.</p>
      <p>Well, now the band are going to take the miniature masterpiece on tour, bringing their acclaimed live show down to Australia in 2020. Yep, the act are hitting up the major Australian cities as part of a long-anticipated tour that will definitely sell out — and very soon.</p>
      <p>Check out all the dates below. <a href="http://handsometours.com/tours/bon-iver-4/">Tickets go on sale December 5</a>.</p>
