        <b>Aston Villa boss Dean Smith has said that a surefire way for his side to improve this season is by going on a run of Premier League victories.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Villa have the chance to make it two wins from two on Sunday against Manchester United <a href="https://livescore.teamtalk.com/England-Premier-League-Aston-Villa-vs-Newcastle-United-829864"><b>having ended a run of three straight league defeats with a 2-0 triumph over Newcastle on Monday</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The result lifted the hosts up to 15th and away from the relegation zone but speaking to <i>Sky Sports </i>after the match, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/dean-smith"><b>Smith</b></a> insisted that his side can continue to improve.</p>
      <p>“This is a really tough league and we have just gone through a period of playing Manchester City and Liverpool, which were games I thought we actually played well in,” the manager said.</p>
      <p>“The table is so tight but you need to put a run together, be tough to beat and keep a clean sheet. I’m really pleased with the clean sheet tonight as we haven’t had too many of those this season.</p>
      <p>“Our form has been good but we knew it would be hard, but I think we’ve been competitive. It takes time gel defensively but I think we achieved that against Newcastle.”</p>
      <p>Monday’s victory was inspired by two brilliant set-pieces from Conor Hourihane, who made his first start for the club since the middle of October having been an unused substitute for games against Manchester City and Wolves.</p>
      <p>Smith was delighted that the midfielder came back in with an impressive performance, saying: “I explained to Conor why I left him out against Man City. He has scored goals in every league he’s played and I always had him earmarked to come back in tonight and he showed us what he was about.”</p>
