      <p>Even as polling remained by and large peaceful with 75.34 per cent average voting till 5 pm in Kharagpur Sadar, Karimpur and Kaliaganj Assembly seats that went to bypolls on Monday, the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> candidate for Karimpur, <b><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/bengal-bypoll-bjp-candidate-heckled-vote-percentage-jay-prakash-majumdar-tmc-6136448/">Jay Prakash Majumdar, was punched and kicked into a ditch by a group of people</a></b> in full view of mediapersons and police in Phipulkhola area of Nadia district.</p>
      <p>According to sources, the EC has sought reports about the Karimpur incident.</p>
      <p>“You have seen how I was punched, pushed and kicked. The physical wound will heal, but will the wounds inflicted on the state’s democracy be healed? This is a real sign that there is no democracy in West Bengal and how Trinamool goons are creating a reign of fear on the poll day. These attacks will not demoralise me and I will continue to visit all the booths. I have complained to the EC,” Majumdar told reporters.</p>
