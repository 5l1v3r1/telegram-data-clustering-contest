      <h3>A former Redback could be in line for a new job at the Adelaide Crows, reports Stephen Rowe.</h3>
      <p>Rowey told FIVEaa Breakfast on Tuesday:</p>
      <blockquote>“Greg Chappell we know has retired as an Aussie selector and George Bailey, the Tasmanian’s won that role.<br/><br/>“Now why do I mention that? Because it’s got impacts on the Crows culture and leadership role. Ex Redback Michael Klinger -- I know he may get the Melbourne Renegades job, but he missed out on that one -- he’s up to his eyeballs for that culture and leadership role…<br/><br/>“So expect an announcement in the next seven days there.”</blockquote>
