      <p>Jets safety Jamal Adams has become one of the more outspoken players in the NFL — both on and off the field — and his trash-talk game is quite strong.</p>
      <p>Adams, in fact, even recently got into it with a family member of a player he just squared off against, which is new.</p>
      <p>It began after Adams posted this photo, showing him putting a big hit on Raiders quarterback Derek Carr. Sure enough, Carr’s brother, Darren, got wind of it, and he replied to the tweet, as you can see below.</p>

      <p>Adams then told his foe to “frame it,” which resulted in Carr posting a few photos of Adams getting beat by Rob Gronkowski for touchdowns.</p>

      <p>That proved to be a bad idea, because Adams then destroyed his counterpart.</p>
