      <h1>Authorities considering several potential charges against Giuliani’s consulting business</h1>

      <p>Authorities issued subpoenas seeking information related to more than a half dozen crimes as part of their investigation into Rudy Giuliani’s consulting firm.</p>
      <p>Giuliani, 75, and two of his associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, are reportedly under investigation by the FBI and the Southern District of New York. Both Parnas and Fruman <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house-intel-has-audio-and-video-recordings-of-giuliani-and-trump">were already arrested</a> on charges related to campaign finance violations, but it looks as though that could just be the beginning.</p>
      <p>According to a Monday <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-subpoenas-seek-information-on-giulianis-consulting-business-11574712722?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=1">report</a> from the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, federal authorities issued subpoenas to several individuals close to the trio as part of an investigation related to nine separate charges: obstruction of justice, money laundering, conspiracy to defraud the United States, making false statements to the federal government, serving as an unregistered foreign agent, donating funds from foreign nationals, making contributions under a false name, mail fraud, and wire fraud.</p>
      <p>Giuliani has not been subpoenaed and denies any wrongdoing in relation to the crimes outlined in the other subpoenas. In addition to the investigation into Giuliani’s associates, the FBI issued subpoenas related to a $325,000 donation to pro-Trump groups America First Action and America First Policies, though a spokesperson said the two groups had not been specifically subpoenaed.</p>
      <p>Parnas and Fruman worked with Giuliani while he was poking around Ukraine to dig up information about potential corruption between former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden, and the Ukrainian company Burisma. The two helped Giuliani get in contact with Ukrainian officials, who could have helped Giuliani’s inquiry.</p>
      <p>Giuliani told the <i>Journal</i> that he wants to speak to authorities to clear the air, but they have yet to contact him personally.</p>
      <p>“All they have to do is come and ask me,” Giuliani said. “There’s obviously a concerted effort to spread as many lies about me as possible, to destroy my reputation so that I’m not credible, when I continue to reveal all of the massive evidence of criminality by the Bidens.”</p>
      <p>Several impeachment witnesses decried Giuliani’s efforts in Ukraine as he attempted to find information on the Bidens. Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch said <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/former-ukraine-ambassador-says-she-felt-threatened-by-trump-and-giuliani">she felt “threatened”</a> by Giuliani’s actions while Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland claimed several Ukrainian officials <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/gordon-sondland-jumps-ship-and-admits-there-was-a-quid-pro-quo">followed Giuliani’s directives</a> as though they came from President Trump.</p>
