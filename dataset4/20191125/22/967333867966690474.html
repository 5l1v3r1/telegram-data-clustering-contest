      <p>The video’s filmer told video licensor Viral Hog in a statement that the dynamic duo live in a flat that’s located above a local area bar, noting that the dogs are “often … caught up on the roof living [their] best lives and observing passersby.”</p>
      <blockquote>“Not your usual garden,” the statement concluded.</blockquote>
