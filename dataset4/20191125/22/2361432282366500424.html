      <p>“Jennifer Lopez is a star in every sense of the word, and you will experience this in her latest film ‘Hustlers<i>.’</i>Starting with her show-stopping entrance Jennifer brings to life the character of Ramona, an exotic dancer, who leads a group of dancer friends to steal money from their clients,” festival chairman Harold Matzner said in a statement. “For this full-force yet grounded performance, deserving of awards consideration, we are thrilled to present Jennifer Lopez with this year’s Spotlight Award.”</p>

      <p>Lopez, who made her feature film debut in the 1995 family drama “Mi Familia,” joins a list of Spotlight Awards recipients that includes Amy Adams, Jessica Chastain, Helen Hunt, Allison Janney, Rooney Mara and Julia Roberts. All recipients have been nominated for an Oscar in the year they were selected, with Janney winning Best Supporting Actress for her work in “I, Tonya.” Lopez, too, is considered a top contender in that category at both the Academy Awards and Golden Globes.</p>
      <p>Palm Springs will be a part of a busy winter for Lopez. Along with a potential awards race, she will host “Saturday Night Live” in December and will perform alongside Shakira at the Super Bowl halftime show in Miami a week before Oscar Sunday.</p>
      <p>Other stars and filmmakers from this year’s top films that will be honored at Palm Springs alongside Lopez include “The Irishman” director Martin Scorsese, “Bombshell” star and producer Charlize Theron, “Joker” star Joaquin Phoenix and “Judy” star Renee Zellweger. The Palm Springs International Film Festival takes place Jan. 2-13.</p>
