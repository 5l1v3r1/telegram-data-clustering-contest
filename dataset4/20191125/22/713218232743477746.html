      <h1>Urunga Visitor Information Centre to open December 16</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ute Schulenberg</a></address>
      <p>The Great Koala National Park team is hard at work preparing the new-look Urunga Visitor Information Centre for its rescheduled opening date of Monday December 16.</p>
      <p>The opening has been delayed by the massive fires devastating the people, landscapes, flora and fauna of the Mid North Coast, which have had a particularly <a href="https://www.bellingencourier.com.au/story/6502556/ley-calls-on-koala-experts-post-bushfires/">brutal impact on koalas</a> in terms of death, injury and habitat loss.</p>
      <p>So currently, it is full-time mops and buckets, brooms and brushes for GKNP team, a mixture of people from the Bellingen Environment Centre and the Nambucca Valley Conservation Association, as they create a unique VIC dedicated to promoting and preserving our iconic native species.</p>
      <p>NVCA's Paula Flack said the new-look centre took inspiration from the Dorrigo Rainforest Centre and aimed to help visitors really understand what koala habitat is like and why it needs to be protected.</p>
      <p>"People will understand the vital role of the Great Koala National Park as well as what it can offer economically and socially," Paula said.</p>
      <p>"We plan to have banners that highlight important aspects like tourism, jobs, koalas, water and climate ... all of which will help generate more public awareness, as well as boost our campaign funds.</p>
      <p>"We're very excited and appreciate the support of Bellingen Shire Council, who have given us a three year lease.</p>
      <blockquote>Our motto is 'The Great Koala National Park: let's make it happen'.<cite>Paula Flack, NVCA</cite></blockquote>
      <p>New coordinator Kevin Evans said the project was entirely community-driven and it was thanks to local support that the centre's doors would be opening.</p>
      <p>"We already have a great team of volunteers, which includes some of those who helped at the centre when it was council-operated," Kevin said.</p>
      <p>The NSW National Parks Association is the lead auspicing organisation of the new centre, which will provide information about the GKNP proposal as well as continuing to offer tourist information for the NSW North Coast.</p>
      <p>It will feature a theatrette, activity space and a Great Koala National Park display. There will be GKNP merchandise on sale and a small caf√© offering coffee and refreshments.</p>
      <p>"We intend the centre to become a destination rather than solely an information centre that passers-by drop in to and we expect benefits to local communities and businesses from the increased visitor numbers," Kevin said.</p>
      <p>Volunteer Coordinator Judy Readman said it was wonderful to have some of the original volunteers back in centre.</p>
      <p>"Those volunteers have a wealth of knowledge and experience at the centre and we hope more will join us along with newly recruited volunteers on this exciting journey," she said.</p>
