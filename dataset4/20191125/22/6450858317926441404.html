      <h2>Transport for London says the company has repeatedly fallen foul of safety rules</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:54:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:54</time> by <a rel="author">Henry Burrell</a></address>
      <p>Transport for London (TfL) has said Uber will not be granted a new license to operate in London after repeated safety failures. The regulatory body claims the popular ride-hailing app is not “fit and proper” to serve London.</p>
      <p>A TfL spokesperson said the body had found “several breaches that placed passengers and their safety at risk”, detailed by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan in the below tweet claiming that 14,000 recent London Uber journeys involved fraudulent driver activity:</p>

      <p>There have been examples of banned drivers easily getting themselves back onto the Uber system by using other drivers’ accounts, despite their private licenses being revoked.</p>
      <p>Jamie Heywood, Uber’s UK Head said the decision was “exceptional and wrong” and that the firm would appeal the decision. Uber will be allowed to continue to operate during the appeal process.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3778666-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Ftech-industry%2Fuber-loses-its-london-operating-license-3778666%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fbusiness-50544283">BBC</a>, Uber currently has 45,000 drivers in London. The decision will be taken to a magistrate, a process that could take months to be decided – so Uber is staying put for the moment,</p>
