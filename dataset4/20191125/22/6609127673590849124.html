        <b>NICOLA Sturgeon has been accused of "misleading voters" for claiming an independent Scotland could secure a "quick" EU entry - despite a wrangle over currency rules.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The First Minister clashed with the BBC’s Andrew Neil as he claimed Scotland could not get back into the bloc using the SNP’s plan to keep using the Pound for an extended period.</p>

      <p>But Ms Sturgeon hit back: “It is not true to say we would have had to establish an independent currency before joining the EU.”</p>
      <p>The First Minister refused to give an exact timescale for the length of time she believes it would take Scotland to become a member state if IndyRef2 results in a split from the UK - but insisted it would be “relatively quick”.</p>
      <p>During the fiery telly interview, Ms Sturgeon rejected his claim that Scotland would have to have its own “stable currency” before it would be allowed back into the EU.</p>
      <p>During the fiery telly interview, Ms Sturgeon rejected his claim that Scotland would have to have its own “stable currency” before it would be allowed back into the EU.</p>
      <p>The SNP’s 354-page Growth Commission indy blueprint set out plans for Scotland to continue using the pound for an undefined “possibly extended transition period”, with a separate Scottish currency only possible after six economic tests are met.</p>
      <p>Mr Neil put it to the Nats boss that if Brexit does happen, Scotland could not rejoin the EU while using the currency of a non-member state.</p>
      <p>She said: “It is not true to say we would have had to establish an independent currency before joining the EU.</p>
      <p>“We would have a discussion with the EU about the journey an independent Scotland was on in terms of currency, and the accession if Scotland was already out of the EU to the point where we rejoined the EU.”</p>
      <p>Ms Sturgeon said she’d had discussions “with different interests” in the EU about an indy Scotland getting back in, adding: “We understand the conditions we would require to meet and the discussions that we’d require to take place.</p>
      <blockquote>we’re in a position of Scotland being taken out of the EU then we will be seeking a way back in.<cite>Nicola Sturgeon</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“But if we’re in a position of Scotland being taken out of the EU then we will be seeking a way back in.”</p>
      <p>Mr Neil also quizzed the SNP leader on Scotland’s notional deficit of 7 per cent being the “largest in Europe”, and said: “It’s all very uncertain.”</p>
      <p>But Ms Sturgeon blasted back: “Scotland faces right now the uncertainty of being ripped out of the EU against our own will. It’s not of our making. And we need to plot the best way forward for our country where we are in charge of the decision that we make.”</p>
      <p>She said the deficit had fallen and that her “task” was to get it “reducing faster”, adding: “That is principally through growing our economy faster which remaining in the EU or returning to the EU helps us to do.”</p>
      <p>Pamela Nash, chief executive of campaign group Scotland in Union, branded Ms Sturgeon’s claim that re-entry to the EU - which would require unilateral agreement from all 27 member states - would be “quick” as “deluded”, and insisted it was an “attempt to mislead voters”.</p>
      <p>Ms Nash said: “EU membership for a separate Scotland would be far from straightforward and the process is likely to be lengthy with no guarantee of success.<br/>“In fact, it may not be possible at all because Spain could veto membership completely.”</p>
      <p>Dr Kirsty Hughes, Director of the Scottish Centre on European Relations, said an independent Scotland using the pound inside the EU would be “problematic” and “tricky” - but she said it was not right to insist the country would have to have its own currency first.</p>
      <p>She said: “The treaties don’t specifically say you should have your own currency, but they do say two things that imply you should have your own currency.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think it would stop Scotland negotiating with the EU to join and that might take a process of two, three, four years.</p>
      <p>“I think the way Andrew Neil has phrased it is not quite right - but I don’t think it’s right for Nicola Sturgeon to say it’s not a problem.</p>

      <p>“It’s pretty hard to show you can meet the EU’s criteria on monetary policy if you don’t have your own currency.”</p>
      <p>During the 30-minute interview, Mr Neil asked Ms Sturgeon if an indy Scotland in the EU would result in “trade friction” at the border with England if the EU leaves the bloc.</p>
      <p>Ms Sturgeon insisted it was a “priority” for her to ensure trade with the UK continues if Scotland becomes independent, but insisted it was not yet clear what Britain’s “final relationship” with the EU will be.</p>
      <p>She said: “When we have clarity on that we have to understand those implications and we have to set out clearly how we deal with those implications in order to keep trade flowing between Scotland and England which is in our interests and in the interests of the rest of the UK.</p>
      <p>“But it is also in our interests to stay part of the EU single market that is eight times the size of the UK market.”</p>
      <p>Ms Sturgeon repeated her claim that Jeremy Corbyn was merely “quibbling” over the timing of IndyRef2 and that he agreed on the “principle” of it.</p>
      <p>The First Minister has warned the Labour leader he should not ask for her help to form a minority Labour government after the December 12 General Election unless he is willing to grant her the powers to hold another vote.</p>
      <p>Mr Neil - who is interviewing the main party leaders in the run-up to next month’s election - put it to her that she has no real “bargaining power” as the only alternative to walking away from a deal with Mr Corbyn would be to allow the Tories back into No10.</p>
      <p>Ms Sturgeon said: “I would never do anything to support a Conservative government in office.”</p>
      <p>Mr Neil also quizzed the FM on her party’s 2016 Holyrood manifesto pledge that a “significant and material change” would be a mandate for a second independence referendum.</p>
      <p>He said if her calls for another referendum on Brexit - which Labour is proposing if it gets into power - result in a Remain vote across the UK, there would be “no material change”.</p>
      <p>She hit back: “The material change, frankly, is the way in which Scotland has had it completely demonstrated to over the past three years that our views and our voice doesn’t matter.”</p>
      <p>Paul Masterton, Scottish Conservative candidate for East Renfrewshire, said: “Here goes Nicola Sturgeon again.</p>
      <p>“We had the same vague assurances during the independence referendum.</p>
      <p>“The reason the First Minister can’t give a timetable on what might happen to Scotland after independence is because the SNP doesn’t know what will happen.</p>
      <p>“Yet still she insists we must have another referendum next year.”</p>
      <p>The Andrew Neil Interviews continue at 7pm on BBC One on Tuesday with Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
