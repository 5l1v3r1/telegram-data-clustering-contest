      <h1>Griselda Records Detail Group Album 'WWCD' &amp; Share Trailer for New Docu-Series</h1>
      <h2>The East Coast crew’s collaborative LP is almost here.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:53:48+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:53</time> by <a rel="author">Patrick Montes</a></address>
      <p>Over one month after the release of <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/westside-gunn">Westside Gunn</a>, <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/conway-the-machine">Conway the Machine</a> and <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/benny-the-butcher">Benny the Butcher</a>‘s collaborative single “Dr. Bird’s,” the Griselda Records emcees are formally introducing their anticipated first group LP for Shady Records, <i>WWCD</i>.</p>
      <p>Notably, <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/griselda-records">Griselda Records</a>‘ 13-track studio album <i>WWCD</i> will be available for streaming later this week, and contains collaborations with Raekwon, Eminem, 50 Cent, Novel and more. To build anticipation for the project, the Griselda Records crew are also coming together to unveil the lead trailer for a special documentary series that revolves around <i>WWCD</i>.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to put the rap game in a chokehold and really introduce myself as my name in hip-hop. I wanted to put it in stone. Griselda is here now. It’s not a game. We intentionally set out to do that. Me and Westside talked, like, ‘2019, we just gonna smother the game,” Conway the Machine shared with <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8530252/conway-interview-look-at-what-i-became"><i>Billboard</i></a> during a September interview. “I tell my brother and Benny [The Butcher] all the time, ‘Let’s not change up our script, let’s not switch nothin’, let’s just keep going where God is here.’ That means just keeping our pen nasty and coming with what we’ve been coming with and where we’ve been coming with it; that same vigor, that same tenacity in our music. If we do that, we’ll be aight.”</p>
      <p>You can take a look at the lead trailer for Griselda Records’ new documentary series above, and check out its cover-art and tracklist below. Griselda Records’ group album <i>WWCD</i> will hit streaming services and similar platforms this Friday, November 29, and is currently available for <a href="https://shop.shadyrecords.com/">pre-order</a>.</p>
