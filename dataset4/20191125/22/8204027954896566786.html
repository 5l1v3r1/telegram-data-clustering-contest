      <p>LEBANON — A 12-year-old boy accused of triggering a lockdown at a Nov. 15 dance at Springboro Junior High School with a 911 call about a gun was released from detention on Monday, in time to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with his family.</p>
      <p>The Clearcreek Twp. boy had been in the Warren County Juvenile Detention Center since the night of the dance, which was disrupted by a series of 911 calls, the first two hang-ups, and the third falsely claiming “someone had a gun” at the school.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Judge Joe Kirby released the boy to his parents, pending a Dec. 11 pretrial hearing.</p>
      <p>“I want someone to be with him at all times,” Kirby said during the detention hearing in the court in Lebanon.</p>
      <p>A week ago, Kirby ordered the boy remain in detention, pending a risk assessment.</p>
      <p>School officials said they had yet to determine disciplinary action. The judge ordered the boy to stay away from school while awaiting a determination from the school.</p>
      <p>Kirby ordered the parents to drop off the boy at the juvenile court center for classroom activities and participation in “treatment groups,” until the school had determined whether he would be allowed to return to class in Springboro.</p>
      <p>He is to remain on house arrest under the supervision of his maternal grandparents while the parents are at work.</p>
      <p>He is charged in Warren County Juvenile Court with inducing panic on school grounds, making false alarms and misuse of the 911 system.</p>
