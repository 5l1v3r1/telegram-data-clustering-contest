      <h1>Exclusive: Ben Ainslie to helm British entry in SailGP as Ineos Team UK agree deal with global series</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/tom-cary/" target="_blank">Tom Cary</a></address>
      <p>Sir Ben Ainslie’s America’s Cup team have agreed a deal to take over Britain’s entry in SailGP with Ainslie himself to helm the boat in 2020, it will be announced on Tuesday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sailing/2018/08/31/went-gin-tonic-cost-110m-britains-richest-man-helping-ben/">Ineos Team UK have entered into a one-year commercial agreement with the new global sailing league</a>, run by software billionaire Larry Ellison and former America’s Cup winner Sir Russell Coutts. Ainslie hopes to extend “beyond that”.</p>
      <p>Ainslie believes that sailing in a different series in the run-up to the next America’s Cup in Auckland in 2021 will help his team’s hopes of becoming the first British winner of one of sport’s oldest trophies.</p>
      <p>“Of course, our major focus remains on preparing and building our AC75 ready for AC36,” Ainslie said. “But it’s a four-year programme and, this being the development phase in what is a new class, most of our time right now is on building and testing the boat. There is very little actually racing.</p>
      <p>“Entering SailGP gives us the chance to sharpen our competitive instincts in a really exciting league against high-quality opposition.”</p>
      <p>SailGP is raced in modified versions of the 50ft catamarans seen at the last America’s Cup in Bermuda in 2017.</p>
      <p>The inaugural season was won by Team Australia, helmed by former America’s Cup winner Tom Slingsby. They narrowly beat Team Japan, who were helmed by another former America’s sailor in the shape of Nathan Outteridge.</p>
      <p>Ainslie said the opportunity to “sharpen his match racing skills” against the likes of Slingsby and Outteridge was a key factor behind entering the league, with Ineos co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe “fully on board with the decision”.</p>

      <p>“We are in a critical 18-month window now as far as the America’s Cup is concerned, but on balance we think it is the right thing to do. I have discussed it with Jim and his instinct, like mine, is that we need to be doing more racing.”</p>
      <p>There are five SailGP events scheduled for next year, but they do not overlap with the America’s Cup World Series event in Cagliari at the end of April or the proposed event in Portsmouth in June. With SailGP boats being one-design, and with little opportunity to practise on them outside of the allotted windows on race weekends, Ainslie said it would not hurt the team’s America’s Cup campaign.</p>
      <p>The four-time Olympic champion admitted it would be “tough to win” in the team’s first campaign against more experienced teams. The British boat came fourth overall this year, with Dylan Fletcher at the helm. Fletcher and Stuart Bithell, who was the team’s flight controller, are campaigning in the 49er at the Tokyo Olympics next summer.</p>
      <p>“The crew will be a mixture of Ineos Team UK sailors and SailGP guys,” said Ainslie, who confirmed that Chris Draper would continue to run the team.</p>
      <p>Matt Gotrel, the former Olympic rower who won gold at Rio 2016 before switching to sailing, was on the British boat this year and will be announced as a new Ineos signing on Tuesday. “We see it as a really exciting league,” Ainslie said.</p>
      <p>Unlike other teams, who are largely being underwritten by Ellison, Ineos Team UK will underwrite their own SailGP campaign. Budgets are thought to be about $7 million (£5.5 million) per team per season.</p>
      <p>“I think our arrival helps show there is a commercially sustainable model out there for SailGP,” Ainslie said. “I believe there is another new entry due to be announced any minute. It’s exciting.”</p>
      <p>The announcement will be officially made at an event at the Oxo Tower in London on Tuesday morning.</p>
