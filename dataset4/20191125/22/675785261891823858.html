      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ed Woodward looked to shrug off sack speculation as they attended Manchester United's annual Gala Dinner.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer is under pressure after a tough start to the season, with Woodward appearing to lose some patience as he watched their 3-3 draw with Sheffield United on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The executive vice-chairman seemed to get into a heated debate with Sir Alex Ferguson watching the game as they trailed 2-0.</p>
      <p>A dramatic fight-back saw the Red Devils look set to snatch a win before a late Oliver McBurnie equaliser meant they had to settle for a point.</p>
      <p>But Woodward rubbed shoulders with Solskjaer and the squad as they raised money for Unicef, with the bosses involved in a game on stage as they shared a laugh and appeared to shrug off an pressure.</p>

      <p>United confirmed they had raised a record-breaking Â£266,000 for club charity partners.</p>
      <p>Victor Lindelof, Marcos Rojo, Juan Mata, Anthony Martial and Fred were all pictured arriving at the event with their partners.</p>
      <p>Youngsters Tahith Chong, Mason Greenwood, Brandon Williams, Daniel James and Scott McTominay posed for a photo together as they arrived, as did close friends Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford.</p>

      <p>Diogo Dalot and Harry Maguire also had a snap together, as well as defensive duo Phil Jones and Axel Tuanzebe.</p>
      <p>Maguire sat alongside Rashford and Lingard as the trio shared a laugh by getting involved in the auction bidding.</p>

      <p>Reserve goalkeeper Lee Grant arrived in an eye-catching blue scarf and glasses as he posed for the camera.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer and fellow coach Michael Carrick were also pictured together with their partners as they enjoyed their evening.</p>
      <p>Whilst they were at the event, Woodward was warned he must "do his job" and make contact with Mauricio Pochettino over the managerial role if United's form does not improve by the New Year.</p>

      <p>Speaking on Sky Sports Monday Night Football, Jamie Carragher said: "There is no doubt Pochettino is the one they wanted and Solskjaer did that well, it forced United to give him the job.</p>
      <p>"He should be allowed in January to get what he needs.</p>
      <p>"At the top of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , when they get to Christmas and January and this continues, and there is a guy like Pochettino who would take them forward.</p>
      <p>"They would not be doing their job if they weren't in contact with him."</p>

      <p>But club legend Gary Neville told Solskjaer to splash the cash in January to "protect himself" with Pochettino now on the market.</p>
      <p>"Two and a half years ago, I said Mauricio Pochettino should be appointed before Jose Mourinho," Neville said.</p>
      <p>"I can't say I don't think he would be the right person.</p>
      <p>"But Ole has been appointed and he has to be selfish now. He has to have that ruthless streak that Mourinho or Conte has and spend money to protect himself.</p>
