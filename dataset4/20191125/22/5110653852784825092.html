      <p>But let's be honest: "Monday Night Football" tonight might as well be promoted as the Lamar Jackson show.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Ravens quarterback, firmly established as a 2019 NFL MVP candidate, is the reason his team enters Monday night's game as a three-point road favorite. Through 10 games this season, Jackson has 2,258 passing yards and 781 rushing yards,the most rushing yards by a QB through 10 games of a season in NFL history. Since entering the NFL in 2018, Jackson has 3,459 passing yards and 1,476 rushing yards in 26 career games.</p>
      <p>With 24 rushing yards on Monday night against theRams, Jackson would become the first player with at least 3,000 passing yards and 1,500 rushing yards over his first two seasons in NFL history.</p>

      <h3>Who plays on Monday Night Football tonight?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Baltimore Ravens at Los Angeles Rams</b>
        </li>
        <li><b>Kickoff time:</b> 8:15 p.m. ET</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In both our NFL Week 12picks against the spread and straight-up predictions, Sporting News projected a Ravensvictory over the Rams on Monday night. Below are the explanations.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/list/week-12-nfl-picks-against-the-spread/1tjq0ocrnmrlb1hzigphiidlly/14">Pick against the spread</a>:The Rams' defense has two elite players in Aaron Donald and Jalen Ramsey, but there are plenty of other holes that the Ravens can exploit with Lamar Jackson, their traditional running game and their intermediate passing game. Jared Goff is struggling, and he faces a top secondary that now has former Ram Marcus Peters behind a revamped pass rush. Jackson will come through with plenty of his usual action, and Goff won't come up with a reaction once Baltimore contains Todd Gurley. <i>Pick: Ravens win 23-16 and cover the spread</i> .</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/list/week-12-nfl-picks-predictions/1o5rmt44twusm1xkrsyqxe4efs/14">Straight-up prediction</a>:The Rams have put together four consecutive strong defensive performances, but it's hard to imagine their slowing down the rushing and scoring freight train that is Lamar Jackson and the Ravens. On the road but in a favorable, prime-time slot, expect the NFL's hottest team to keep rolling. <i>Pick: Ravens 28, Rams 23</i> .</p>
