      <h1>Danny DeVito: I ‘always wanted’ to make a ‘Matilda’ sequel</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:18:28+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:18</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Sparks</a></address>
      <p>Danny DeVito has played some lowdown villains in his day, including mutant baddie the Penguin from “Batman Returns,” ruthless intergalactic business developer Mr. Swackhammer in “Space Jam” and the reprehensible Frank Reynolds — not exactly a villain, but definitely amoral — on FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.”</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/11/25/matilda-sequel-danny-devito-jumanji-next-level/">in an interview with ComicBook.com</a> last week, DeVito, 75, revealed the villain closest to his heart is deadbeat dad Harry Wormwood of “Matilda,” a role he performed in the film adaptation of Roald Dahl’s book (which he also directed).</p>
      <p>“I always wanted to do ‘Matilda 2’, but when the kid was still a kid, but that was like 20 years ago, 25 years ago,” DeVito said of the 1996 movie, also starring Rhea Perlman, Mara Wilson and Pam Ferris (“Tolkien”).</p>
      <p>“Maybe Matilda has a kid, and we can do something [with] that, I don’t know,” he added.</p>
      <p>Wilson, the actress who played the story’s protagonist, is now 32 years old and hasn’t appeared on the silver screen since 2000 in “Thomas and the Magic Railroad.” Would this proposition be enough to coax the former child star into reprising the role?</p>
      <p>Although Wilson has never suggested the possibility, she’s been outspoken in the past about her attachment to the character and interest in how Matilda’s life has unfolded.</p>

      <p>“I can’t remember my life before her,” <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/mara-wilson-matilda-and-me-at-30">wrote Wilson in a 2018 Vanity Fair essay</a> speculating on Matilda’s adult life. “In many ways, she’s been like a big sister: someone I have admired, someone I have aspired to be like, and at times, someone I have resented.”</p>
      <p>DeVito’s timing couldn’t be better. Reboot projects are dominating Hollywood, and in 2018, Netflix <a href="https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-to-create-exclusive-slate-of-original-animated-event-series-from-the-iconic-roald-dahl-story-universe">announced a partnership</a> with The Roald Dahl Story Company to bring works by the children’s book author to life. At the time, Netflix revealed plans for “a new slate of animated event series” to begin production this year, adding a handful of stories involved in the deal, including “Matilda,” “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” and “The BFG.”</p>
      <p>“Our mission, which is purposefully lofty, is for as many children as possible around the world to experience the unique magic and positive message of Roald Dahl’s stories,” said Dahl’s widow, Felicity. “This partnership with Netflix marks a significant move toward making that possible and is an incredibly exciting new chapter for the Roald Dahl Story Co. Roald would, I know, be thrilled.”</p>
      <p>Currently, DeVito stars alongside Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Karen Gillan (“Guardians of the Galaxy”), Awkwafina (“Crazy Rich Asians”) and Danny Glover in another sequel, “Jumanji: The Next Level,” in theaters on Dec. 13.</p>
