      <p>LAHAINA, Hawaii (AP) — Jake Toolson scored 20 points, TJ Haws added 15 and Brigham Young knocked off UCLA 78-63 in the opening round of the Maui Invitational on Monday night.</p>
      <p>BYU (4-2) made up for a size disadvantage against UCLA with ball movement and good perimeter shooting. The Cougars hit 62% from the floor, 9 of 18 3s and used a pair of big runs to pull away in the second half.</p>
      <p>Haws scored 12 of his points after halftime and Kolby Lee added 13 for BYU.</p>
      <p>UCLA (4-2) shot well early in both halves but went cold late to lose its second straight to a smaller-conference school.</p>
      <p>Jules Bernard had 16 points and Cody Riley added 12 for the Bruins.</p>
      <p>The Day 1 Maui finale featured two teams with new coaches.</p>
      <p>Mick Cronin arrived at UCLA after a successful stint at Cincinnati hoping to rebuild a program that had lost its way under previous coach Steve Alford.</p>

      <p>The Bruins were off to a solid start before a 10-point home loss to Hofstra in their last game before heading to Maui.</p>
      <p>Mark Pope returned to BYU following at stint at Utah Valley, taking over after his former boss, Dave Rose retired.</p>
      <p>The Cougars have wins over Cal State Fullerton and Houston, but lost to San Diego State and Boise State with star player Yoeli Childs suspended due to paperwork issues.</p>
      <p>Both teams shot well early once in Maui.</p>
      <p>UCLA worked the ball inside out and cooled after a fast start, finishing the first half 13 for 29 from the floor.</p>
      <p>BYU offset the Bruins’ size advantage by going outside and slashing, hitting 15 of 23 shots to lead 36-32.</p>
      <p>The second half started the same way, both teams hitting shots, neither able to get much separation.</p>

      <p>The Cougars took control with a 12-2 run to go up 63-54 with six minutes left and went on a late 15-2 run to put the Bruins away.</p>
      <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>BYU struggled shooting at times this season but had no such problem in the Lahaina Civic Center to earn a spot in the Maui semifinals.</p>
      <p>UCLA was unable to use its advantages in size and athleticism, and now is headed to the loser’s side of the bracket.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>BYU plays No. 4 Kansas in Tuesday’s semifinals.</p>
      <p>UCLA faces Chaminade.</p>
