      <p>Ajit Pawar’s volte-face seems to have created fissures in the city unit of the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/nationalist-congress-party-ncp/">Nationalist Congress Party</a> (NCP), with many local party workers likely to stand by him despite chief Sharad Pawar distancing himself from his nephew’s dramatic action.</p>
      <p>According to sources, the party workers in the Pune unit are staunch supporters of Ajit as it was under his leadership that the NCP had managed to snatch power in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) from Suresh Kalmadi-led Congress in 2007. Ajit had also consolidated the party’s position in the city by retaining power in the civic body in 2012. He was also at the helm of affairs in the city’s politics from 2007 to 2017, and held the post of the guardian minister till 2014.</p>
      <p>Groomed under his leadership, sources said, a few local party leaders continued to be in touch with Ajit even after he joined hands with the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a>.</p>
      <p>Former mayor Datta Dhankawade reportedly met Ajit at his residence in Mumbai, however, on Monday he refused to divulge any information about the meeting.</p>
      <p>“It is obvious that Ajit Pawar played a major role in winning the 2007 PMC election. He had managed to end the dominance of Kalmadi-led Congress in the civic politics. The party has strengthened its base in the city under the leadership of Ajit, so there are many in the party who will stand by him (even if he continues to support BJP against the party chief’s stand),” an NCP leader considered close to Ajit, said.</p>
      <p>The leader said that the local NCP leaders are aware of the control Ajit wields on the civic administration. “The dominance of Ajit Pawar in the city’s politics will continue, and it will be in the interest of the local leaders to stay with him,” the NCP leader added.</p>
      <p>Another NCP leader, however, said the senior leaders in the city unit would align with Sharad Pawar, if Ajit decides to part. “The senior leaders in the local unit have been with Sharad Pawar from the beginning and they believe only in the NCP chief. They will never shift sides. It is only a few of the younger leaders who are likely to extend support to Ajit. So, there will not be much change,” a senior NCP leader said.</p>
      <p>Party’s city unit chief and newly elected legislator Chetan Tupe, meanwhile, went public to announce his support for the party patriarch. Vadgaonsheri MLA Sunil Tingre, considered close to Ajit, also attended the legislators’ meeting called by the NCP chief and signalled that he would continue with the party led by Sharad Pawar.</p>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/devendra-fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis</a> and Ajit Pawar were sworn in by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari as the Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister, respectively, at a hush-hush ceremony November 23, even as NCP supremo backed the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/shiv-sena/">Shiv Sena</a>-led Maha Vikas Aghadi in the state.</p>
