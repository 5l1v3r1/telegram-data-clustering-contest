      <h1>Gearbox's beleaguered hero shooter Battleborn goes offline forever in January 2021</h1>
      <h2>Game pulled from all digital storefronts.</h2>

      <p>Gearbox says it's started the process of "sunsetting" hero shooter Battleborn, and has warned fans that the game will go offline for good in January 2021.</p>
      <p>Battleborn was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-06-battleborn-review">reasonably well-received</a> when it launched for PC and consoles in 2016, with many praising its ambitious, inventive blend of first-person shooting and MOBA-style action, even if the combination didn't always land in practice.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Battleborn, it was quickly overshadowed by Blizzard's Overwatch, whose success was as immediate and sustained as Battleborn's failure. Publisher 2K <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-08-05-yes-battleborn-flopped-but-2k-vows-to-stick-with-it">declared it a flop</a> a little over three months after its release, and Gearbox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-06-battleborn-free-trial-makes-the-game-free-to-play-essentially">adopted a free-to-play model</a> the following year in a last-ditch bid to attract more players.</p>

      <p>Despite those efforts, Battleborn just wasn't to be and, a few months later, Gearbox announced its team would be moving to other projects and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-09-18-and-thats-that-for-battleborn">would no longer be updating</a> the game. It did, however, pledge to keep its servers up and active "for the foreseeable future".</p>
      <p>Now, however, Battleborn's end is in sight. In a <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038371534">message posted on 2K's support site</a>, the publisher has announced it will be deactivating Battleborn's servers in January 2021, at which point the game will no longer be playable "in any way".</p>
      <p>As part of Battleborn's long, slow winding down, the ability to purchase premium currency will be removed from 24th February next year (it can still be earned and spent in-game until shutdown, however), and more immediately, the game has been delisted from all digital storefronts and is no longer available for sale.</p>
      <p>"We're extremely proud of the work that went into the game, and want to extend our deep appreciation to all the fans for their support," Gearbox wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/Battleborn/status/1199056777804795904">in a tweet</a> accompanying the news, "We'll continue to provide updates on the sunsetting of the title when appropriate."</p>
