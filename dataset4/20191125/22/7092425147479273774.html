          <b>Aston Villa secured a much-needed win at the expense of Newcastle at Villa Park this evening thanks to goals from Conor Hourihane and Anwar El Ghazi.</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Both strikes came in the first-half, both from set-pieces after two sloppy fouls from Steve Bruce's side.</p>
      <p>Jack Grealish ran the show for the home team, causing Newcastle's defence real problems, while Corkman Hourihane bagged a goal and an assist on the night.</p>
      <p>But it was another game where the Magpies' attackers failed to score or make an impact.</p>
      <p>Buzz Sport takes a look at who impressed and who flopped in the Midlands.</p>

      <h3>Aston Villa player ratings</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Tom Heaton - 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kept Newcastle's attack at bay well</p>
      <p>
        <b>Frederic Guilbert - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Had to deal with the tricky Allan Saint-Maximin</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ezri Konsa - 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Impressive and made a case for permanently replacing Bjorn Engels</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tyrone Mings - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Outshone by Konsa but solid</p>
      <p>
        <b>Matt Targett - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dangerous going forward and solid at the back</p>
      <p>
        <b>Douglas Luiz - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>A couple of wild efforts but controlled the play well</p>
      <p>
        <b>John McGinn - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Quiet by his usual lofty standards</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jack Grealish - 9</b>
      </p>

        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/villareport/status/1199083637037260811?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>Lively throughout. Pulled the strings for Villa and unlucky to not get a goal</p>
      <p>
        <b>Conor Hourihane - 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>An inch-perfect free-kick to open the scoring</p>
      <p>
        <b>Anwar El Ghazi - 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Calls for him to be played a striker. Well taken goal from close range</p>
      <p>
        <b>Wesley - 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Didn't threaten the Newcastle defence nearly enough and missed a sitter to make it 3-0</p>
      <h3>Newcastle United player ratings</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Martin Dubravka - 4</b>
      </p>
      <p>Some fine saves but poor positioning for the free-kick</p>
      <p>
        <b>DeAndre Yedlin - 3</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stupid foul which led to the first goal</p>
      <p>
        <b>Federico Fernandez - 4</b>
      </p>
      <p>Didn't look as solid without Fabian Schar and Jamaal Lascelles next to him</p>
      <p>
        <b>Paul Dummett - 4</b>
      </p>
      <p>His return to the first team wasn't a good one</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jetro Willems - 4</b>
      </p>
      <p>Absent throughout and wasn't allowed to get forward</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jonjo Shelvey - 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Given the armband and enjoyed a reasonable range of passing</p>
      <p>
        <b>Isaac Hayden - 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Didn't dominate the midfield. Ineffective</p>
      <p>
        <b>Miguel Almiron - 4</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Still waiting for that first goal. Failed to make an impact</p>
      <p>
        <b>Allan Saint-Maximin - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>The only attacker player to offer anything for Newcastle</p>
      <p>
        <b>Joelinton - 3</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another goalless game and doesn't look like a £40m striker</p>
