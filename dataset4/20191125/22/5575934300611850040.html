      <p>A few weeks before the Grammys, Rexha revealed on Instagram that several designers refused to dress her for the event because she is “too big.”</p>
      <p>“I was a little scared putting it out because a lot of times, you don’t want to come out off like this person that’s always complaining,” <a href="https://www.insider.com/bebe-rexha-scared-speaking-about-not-finding-designer-grammys-2019-3">Rexha told Insider</a>.</p>
      <p>However, Rexha got the last laugh, because <a href="https://www.insider.com/bebe-rexha-grammys-red-ball-gown-2019-2">she looked absolutely breathtaking</a> in this Monsoori ballgown.</p>

      <p>Jenner’s Rami Kadi gown has “two floor-length swaths of fabric that cascaded down the front and back,” that essentially left both of her legs completely exposed. <a href="https://www.insider.com/kendall-jenner-oscars-after-party-daring-dress-2019-2">Insider called it a</a> “fresh take on both the <a href="https://www.insider.com/victorias-secret-fashion-show-after-party-sheer-looks-2018-11">‘naked’ dress</a> and ‘no pants’ trends.”</p>

The dress looked like flowing water or a blooming flower, and it was easily the most memorable look from the cast.</p>

      <p>The look was designed by NYC-based luxury apparel brand, The Blonds. <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/billy-porter-met-gala-2019-the-blonds">Porter told Vogue</a> that the outfit was “drawn from Diana Ross’ Ancient Egypt look, with additional influences from Elizabeth Taylor in ‘Cleopatra,’ and Cher’s many Egypt-inspired looks.”</p>
