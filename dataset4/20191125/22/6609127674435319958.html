        <b>NEW Aberdeen chairman Dave Cormack has warned that the Dons may be priced <b>OUT</b> of leaving Pittodrie.</b>
      </p>
      <p>They had planned to move to a new stadium by 2023 — but <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4991354/aberdeen-derek-mcinnes-kevin-clancy-penalty/">Dons</a> chief Cormack has revealed the flit could be delayed or even scrapped.</p>

      <p>Cormack, who replaces Stewart Milne as Dons supremo next month, raised the majority of the £12.5million needed to fund their new training ground, Cormack Park.</p>
      <p>But now the task is finding the £45m needed for a new stadium at the Kingsford complex.</p>
      <p>It’s a job made tougher by the value of Pittodrie slumping to £11m as the economic downturn continues to hit the Granite City.</p>
      <p>US-based tycoon Cormack’s contacts have brought in an additional £5m, including a<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4991222/aberdeen-atlanta-united-dave-cormack-stewart-milne-chairman/"> new partnership with MLS outfit Atlanta United.</a></p>

      <p>That will see the American side’s president, and former Spurs director, Darren Eales join the board.</p>
      <p>When asked if Aberdeen might end up staying at Pittodrie, Cormack said: “You can never say never. If we can’t raise the money then we can’t do it.</p>
      <p>“But we are confident our best opportunity is still to move to Kingsford.</p>
      <p>"The 2023 date is moveable. I’m not fixated on two years or six years.</p>

      <p>“But I want to make sure we are investing in the football team, as there is no way we are going to invest in a stadium and have a team which is ninth in the league.</p>
      <p>“The critical factor for us is the performance of the first team. It’s a hard balancing act and £45m is a lot of money to raise.</p>
      <p>“If you look at our recent report we’ve had Pittodrie valued, and there is no point in us trying to sell.</p>
      <p>“We wouldn’t maximise the value of Pittodrie in the current downturn.</p>
      <p>“Nobody can commit to money that isn’t there, but a new stadium is our best option.</p>
      <p>“Let’s say we got £15m for the sale of Pittodrie, well Hearts spent £18m on building their new stand.</p>
      <p>“It would cost us £55m to redevelop the stands here, so you weigh that up against £45m for a custom-built stadium.”</p>
      <p>He reassured fans that Dons won’t try to raise funds quickly by selling top assets like Scott McKenna, Lewis Ferguson and Sam Cosgrove.</p>
      <p>He added: “We have resisted offers for players. We did it last summer, and not just for Scott McKenna.</p>
      <p>“But at the right time when there are players coming through, of course we will look at accepting offers.</p>
      <p>“McKenna will move at some stage, but we have always said it has to be right for the player and Aberdeen."</p>
