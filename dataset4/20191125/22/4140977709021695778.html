          </p>
          <p>For both of Oklahoma City Thunder and Golden State Warriors, today’s encounter could end up begin a defining moment. Languishing in the trenches of the Western Conference, this is an encounter which comes bearing for either side hefty and colossal consequences as either unit looks to use it as a means to shrug out of the ordeal they find themselves embroiled in.</p>
          <p>For Golden State Warriors in particular, a defeat in this match as well could end up being irreparable. From being the most dominant side in the league over the past couple of years to now finding themselves nailed down in last place in the conference, the fall from glory has been a calamitous and contentious one. </p>

                <p>Althouhg injuries have played a major role in the side’s horrendous decline and slump with the long spate of injuries the side are riddled by rendering redundant and obsolete the services of their star performers, the brand of basketball they have doled out has still made for a stinker of a viewing. There’s been a clear lack of fight from their players with the side’s aspirations of challenging for the division or conference title already vanishing up in smoke with the side falling to 14 defeats in 17 matches.</p>
                <p>Elsewhere in 13th place with a 5-10 record, things haven’t been any better for Oklahoma City Thunder either with the side coming into this one with a spree of three defeats. Althouhg they did manage to push Los Angeles Lakers close the last time around, the 130-127 was a damaging one but the perseverance and fortitude displayed in that contest will buy them ahead of this encounter.</p>

                            <h3>GSW Vs OKC Dream11 Point Guard</h3>
                            <p>With 6 assist per match till now, Oklahoma City Thunder’s Chris Paul has carried out his duties as a point guard for the side to perfection. His quirky and vibrant displays have seen him play an enigmatic role for the side with his extradonaire capabilities coming to the fore to see him become a pivotal player for the outfit.</p>
                            <p>Elsewhere, we have the one player come in from Golden State Warriors as well with Ky Bowman being our choice for this one. The slew of injuries to the side’s integral players have handed him over with chances he would have otherwise been bereft of and with some good displays, we are earmarking him for this docket.</p>
                            <h3>GSW Vs OKC Dream11 Shooting Guard </h3>
                            <p>Alec Burks will be coming into our side from GSW as the shooting guard owing to the acumen he’s shown when it comes to dropping treys. His ability to open up the zone and position himself with acumen just outside the paint as paid rewards for him with us envisaging him to emulate the same succulent performance today as well.</p>
                            <h3>GSW Vs OKC Dream11 Small Forward</h3>
                            <p>The most heavily decked up segment of our Dream 11 side, we are moving in with the two players from the home side with the partnership of Glenn Robinson and Omari Spellman being roped in by us. In these two players, the side have performers who have managed to fill in the void left up the departure of their pivotal performers, two players who has intertwined their positions to send down triples and floating jump points.</p>
                            <p>From Oklahoma City Thunder we have the one player come in as well for us in the form of Danilo Gallinari. The reason his side were able to make things nervy for Los Angeles Lakers the last time around was his ability to maraud inside the circle and pull off rebounds and deflection at will to ensure his side’s attacking plays were converted into points.</p>
                            <h3>GSW Vs OKC Dream11 Power Forward</h3>
                            <p>Perhaps the most impressive player from GSW’s contingent this season, Eric Paschall was always going to be a must have player for this encounter. At a time when his side have failed to muster up attacking soirees, he’s regaled us in showings which have augured extremely well for his elevation into he team’s playing 5 to see us earmark him for the day.</p>
                            <h3>GSW Vs OKC Dream11 Centre</h3>
                            <p>Nerlens Noel will be making an advent form Oklahoma City Thunder to enter the fray of our side as the culminating player for this impending outing given his two toned astute as a player which has seen him manifest his skill set in both the dockets of his side’s gameplan.</p>
                            <h3>Star Player</h3>
                            <p>Paul has been selected to captain our side out as the star player as well for this encounter.</p>
