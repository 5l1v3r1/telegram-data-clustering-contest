      <p>The big battle is now one full year away.</p>
      <p>It had been speculated earlier this year, in the wake of<i> Godzilla: King of the Monsters</i> under-performing at the box office, that next MonsterVerse installment <b><i>Godzilla vs. Kong</i> </b>was going to be releasing later than originally planned, and tonight <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/godzilla-vs-kong-pushed-to-november-2020/">The Wrap</a> confirms that the <b>Adam Wingard</b>-directed film is indeed no longer releasing on<b> March 13, 2020</b>.</p>
      <p>The WB/Legendary fight film will now be releasing on <b>November 11, 2020</b>.</p>
      <p>“<i>[Godzilla vs. Kong] will deliver for fans in the way they were looking for</i>,” WB’s Toby Emmerich recently stated. “<i>It might come out later in the year, so we can deliver an A+ movie</i>.”</p>
      <p>The epic adventure will pit two of the greatest icons in motion picture history against one another – the fearsome Godzilla and the mighty Kong – with humanity caught in the balance…</p>
      <p>
        <i>“In a time when monsters walk the Earth, humanity’s fight for its future sets Godzilla and Kong on a collision course that will see the two most powerful forces of nature on the planet collide in a spectacular battle for the ages. As Monarch embarks on a perilous mission into uncharted terrain and unearths clues to the Titans’ origins, a human conspiracy threatens to wipe the creatures, both good and bad, from the face of the earth forever.”</i>
