      <p>RIYADH: The Saudi Falcons Club has applied a set of procedures and regulations to preserve falcons and their wildlife through the organization of a falcons trade and by raising awareness about their breeding and purchase. </p>
      <p>The move comes amid the start of the countdown to the second edition of the King Abdulaziz Falcons Festival.</p>
      <p>Events like this festival are held during this time of the year because of the nature of the birds. They do not tolerate high temperatures, which affect their ability to fly properly.</p>
      <p>The club has also chosen the location of the events — in Malham, north of Riyadh — over a vast area, to enable the falcons to move freely and accommodate as many participants and visitors as possible.</p>
      <p>In line with the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 reform plans, the Saudi Falcons Club seeks to strengthen Saudi Arabia’s position in the preservation of the environment and heritage. Its objectives are associated with the environment and sustainable development, which stipulate the need to preserve them as a national and humanitarian duty and as a responsibility to future generations.</p>
      <p>The festival will open its doors to visitors for 16 days from early December. The elite falconers will compete in a 400 meter race and the Mazayen competition.<br/> </p>
