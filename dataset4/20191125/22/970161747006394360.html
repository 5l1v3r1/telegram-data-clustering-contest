      <p>I’m a Celebrity’s former proprietor of the Outback Shack, Kiosk Keith, is apparently desperate for his old job back after being fired for being drunk on the job.</p>
      <p>Keith, real name Raymond Grant, was pulled from the show in January 2018 after reports he had been drinking while filming the show.</p>
      <p>The father-of-four also apparently ‘behaved inappropriately towards a female member of the team’.</p>
      <p>But according to his ex-wife Donna, Raymond has turned himself around since getting the boot from the show, and now wants a new shot at the series.</p>
      <p>‘He’s in a really good health and loves going out to work every day,’ <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10419644/kiosk-keith-im-a-celeb/">she told The Sun</a>.</p>
      <p>‘Raymond said he’d never go back to I’m A Celebrity as a labourer but he would like to back in the role of Kiosk Keith.’</p>
