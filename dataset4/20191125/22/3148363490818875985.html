      <p>The Producers Guild of America announced Monday that <i>Bombshell</i>, which also stars Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie, will receive the Stanley Kramer Award, which is given each year to a movie or individual for promoting “public awareness of important social issues.”</p>
      <p>The award will be handed out at the PGA’s annual ceremony scheduled for Jan. 18 in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/08/21/video-bombshell-trailer-starring-charlize-theron-and-nicole-kidman-is-hollywoods-latest-take-down-of-fox-news/"><i>Bombshell</i></a> dramatizes the downfall of the late Fox News founder Roger Ailes, following allegations of sexual harassment that shook up the top-rated cable news station and helped create the #MeToo movement.</p>
      <p>John Lithgow plays Ailes while Kidman plays former network host Gretchen Carlson. <i>Nashville</i> actress Connie Britton plays Ailes’ wife, Beth.</p>
      <p>The movie was directed by Jay Roach, who helmed HBO’s 2012 movie <i>Game Change</i>, an unflattering dramatization of Sarah Palin’s run for Vice President.</p>
      <p>Lionsgate is set to open the movie in limited release Dec. 13 before going wide the following week.</p>

      <p>In announcing the award, the PGA praised <i>Bombshell</i> for showing that “cinema has the power to encapsulate moments and movements in a way that serves and enlightens us all.”</p>
      <p>Past winners of the Stanley Kramer Award include actors Jane Fonda and <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/09/08/sean-penn-slams-trump-says-theres-not-a-chance-in-hell-for-re-election/">Sean Penn;</a> the Al Gore climate change documentary <i>An Inconvenient Truth; </i>and the CNN campus rape documentary <i>The Hunting Ground</i>, which was the subject of a backlash after its reporting <a href="https://www.thefire.org/harvard-professors-denounce-the-hunting-ground-as-misleading-propaganda/">was called into question</a>.</p>
      <p>The award was named after filmmaker Stanley Kramer, who helmed <i>Inherit the Wind</i>, <i>Judgement at Nuremberg</i>, and <i>Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner? </i></p>
