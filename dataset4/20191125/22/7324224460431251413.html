      <p>Newcastle manager Steve Bruce’s maiden return to former club Aston Villa ended in a wretched 2-0 Premier League defeat.</p>
      <p>Goals from Conor Hourihane and Anwar El Ghazi in the space of four first-half minutes eased Villa’s recent woes after a run of three straight defeats had plunged Dean Smith’s side to one place above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>Inspired by returning captain Jack Grealish after a month-long absence with a calf injury, Villa ensured it was an unhappy visit back to Villa Park for Bruce, who was sacked in October last year after two years in charge.</p>
      <p>Grealish, sidelined for the 2-1 defeats at home to Liverpool and at Wolves, again provided the spark Villa had been missing in those games.</p>

      <p>In fairness, little had been created by either side in the opening half-hour, with El Ghazi a yard shy of a toe poke onto a piercing low ball into the six-yard box from Matt Targett, while Martin Dubravka produced a stunning fingertip save to deny Douglas Luiz’s fizzing 22-yard right-foot curler.</p>
      <p>Left-back Targett was the victim of a bizarre 20th-minute incident when he vomited on the pitch just after he had taken a throw-in – but after treatment and water the £15.6million summer signing from Southampton was able to continue.</p>
      <p>Although Villa were always the more threatening side, with the Magpies primarily reliant on the counter-attack, it required two set-piece situations to prise open the visitors.</p>

      <p>The first arrived in the 32nd minute as Grealish raced onto a raking through ball, only for the attacking midfielder to be blatantly pushed in the back by the covering DeAndre Yedlin a yard outside the area.</p>
      <p>It was prime territory for Hourihane, whose first touch was a tap pass to Grealish who in turn stopped the ball dead. The Republic of Ireland international sumptuously whipped around the wall, and the poorly-positioned Dubravka, for his fifth goal of the season.</p>
      <p>Four minutes later Villa doubled their lead, with Grealish again drawing a foul, although it appeared as if he had deliberately caught the outstretched leg of Federico Fernandez.</p>
      <p>On this occasion, Hourihane curled a piercing low ball into the six-yard box, and with Newcastle’s defence leaden-footed, El Ghazi easily stabbed home his fourth goal of the season from three yards.</p>

      <p>It prompted cries from the Villa fans of ‘Brucey, Brucey what’s the score?’ as the home faithful teased their former boss.</p>
      <p>Villa, though, were then indebted to Tom Heaton for preserving their two-goal cushion just before and after the break. First he pushed away a downward header from Fernandez, before tipping beyond the post a corner-of-the-net-bound 20-yard strike from Allan Saint-Maximin.</p>
      <p>Dubravka responded in the 53rd minute with a brilliant save of his own as his defence again went missing, pushing away a six-yard header from an unmarked Ezri Konsa onto an inswinging Grealish corner.</p>
      <p>In the 77th minute, Dubravka again denied Villa a third, saving from Wesley at point-blank range after another low ball had been played into the six-yard box, this time from Targett.</p>
      <p>Despite Bruce playing all three substitutes, including strikers Andy Carroll and Dwight Gayle, his side were unable to find a way back into the game.</p>
