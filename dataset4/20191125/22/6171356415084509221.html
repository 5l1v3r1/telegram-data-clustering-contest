      <h1>Linksys Velop 2-pack tri-band mesh Wi-Fi is $100 off on Amazon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:01:57+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/david-oh/" target="_blank">David Oh</a></address>
      <p>The benefits of a mesh Wi-Fi system are numerous: better coverage, no single point of failure, modular expandability, and maintenance of a single SSID and connection throughout the home. With numerous players in this competitive field, prices have become a lot more affordable on these once very expensive mesh systems. <a href="https://www.linksys.com/us/">Linksys</a>, a well-known name among networking companies, has the <a href="https://www.linksys.com/us/velop/">Velop line</a>, and there is a significant markdown today on one of its offerings. A two-pack of tri-band routers currently only costs $200 on Amazon, which is a saving of $100 on the usual $300 retail price.</p>
      <p>Linksys claims two of its tri-band nodes can easily blanket strong Wi-Fi signals to multi-story homes with three to five bedrooms (up to 4,000 square feet of coverage). With tri-band connectivity speeds (867 + 867 + 400 Mbps, per node), demanding scenarios such as multiple streams of 4K media shouldn't be a problem. Each node can handle up to maximum 32 clients, so two nodes will be enough for about 60 devices, suitable for a modern home.</p>

      <p>Should you require even more coverage later down the line, additional nodes can be added to vanquish any dead spots.</p>
