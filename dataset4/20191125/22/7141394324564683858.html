      <h1>Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Signals Imminent Rise to $10K Ahead of Meteoric Surge to $1 Million, Says Analyst PlanB</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:15:01+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>One of the most closely followed crypto analysts in the industry says he thinks Bitcoin is likely to stage a major comeback and return to $10,000 – before the new year. That leaves 39 days for BTC to surge roughly $3,000 from its current price around $7,000.</p>
      <p>According to the anonymous analyst known as PlanB the asset’s stock-to-flow ratio is flashing a rare buy opportunity, suggesting a turnaround is on the horizon.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Call me crazy, but it wouldn’t surprise me if BTC closes 2019 at $10k+.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Opportunities like this (Bitcoin below S2F model value, 6 months before the halving) are rare.</i>

      <p>Stock-to-flow compares the amount of a commodity in circulation divided by the amount produced per year.</p>
      <p>The model, which is traditionally used to analyze precious metal markets, gained notoriety in crypto circles this year and earned a number of <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2019/07/29/cnbcs-joe-kernen-teases-bitcoin-surge-to-55000-btc-ethereum-xrp-litecoin-bitcoin-cash-binance-coin-eos-tron-forecasts/">mentions</a> on CNBC by anchor Joe Kernen.</p>
      <p>According to PlanB, the ratio tracks Bitcoin’s past price movements with more than 90% accuracy, and indicates BTC will reach $1,000,000 around 2025.</p>
      <p>In the short term, a <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2019/11/24/bitcoin-falls-to-6768-heres-what-7-analysts-are-saying-about-btc/">recent roundup</a> of analysts shows most believe BTC has not yet reached a bottom.</p>
      <p>Veteran trader Tone Vays remains the most bearish. He believes BTC will reach $4,500 before a new, sustainable bull market can begin.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin is up 0.84% at time of publishing at $7,193, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
