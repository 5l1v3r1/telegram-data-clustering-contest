        <b>Amanda Holden and Myleene Klass are mothers to young children so it’s no surprise the pair looked thrilled to enjoy evening off letting their hair down on a school night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The radio presenters wisely left their partners at home to tuck in the kids as they attended Global’s Make Some Noise event in London on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Myleene, who gave birth to her first son Apollo this summer, shimmered into the venue in a black and gold strapless gown, while Amanda kept it clean in a white asymmetrical jumpsuit.</p>
      <p>The pair had each other for company as they walked the red carpet and seemed to share each other’s joy as they smiled and laughed with each other.</p>
      <p>And the fun didn’t stop on the red carpet as Myleene, 41, shared a video of her bubbling champagne glass while singing her heart out to Paul Walker who was performing along with Stephen Miron.</p>

      <p>Global’s Make Some Noise is a national charity which funds and empowers smaller charities across the UK, helping disadvantaged children and young people.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere on the red carpet, Amanda also stopped to take photos with her Heart Breakfast co-host Jamie Theakston and with them both out on a Monday night, we won’t envy their heads tomorrow morning.</p>

      <p>Other stars in attendance were Marvin Humes, Kelly Brook, Kirsty Gallacher and Georgia Toffolo, while singer Freya Ridings also did the honours of performing.</p>
      <p>Smooth radio host Myleene spent some quality time with her baby boy hours before hitting the red carpet, and shared a cute video of the three-month-old snoring while having a good nap.</p>
      <p>Apollo was probably tired out after being serenaded by his older sister, Myleene’s 12-year-old daughter Ava, who played the piano as he wriggled away in his baby chair.</p>

      <p>‘He gets a private concert every morning! Some blues for Apollo this morning,’ Myleene captioned the adorable Instagram story.</p>
      <p>Apollo is the god of music and science – my two passions. We thought it was such a strong name and at 8lbs 5oz, he was a strong, bouncing boy,’ she told Hello magazine.</p>
      <p>‘My waters broke and I was in the birthing pool. We had a really easy first three hours, to the point that I thought we would all be home by 7pm. But I don’t remember what happened next. I lost five hours of my life and it was a pretty complicated birth in the end.’</p>
