        <i>José Mourinho said he missed ‘the music in the away dressing room’ in a winning return to management as his Tottenham side triumphed 3-2 at West Ham on Saturday. <br/>'Today the feeling is: I was where I belong ... I just love it, and of course the best thing in football is to win matches,' Mourinho said.<br/>It was Spurs' first win away in the Premier League since 20 January.</i>
