      <h1>ESPN Analysts Have Brutally Honest Message For Texas Fans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:17:53+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Following a statement win over Georgia in last year’s Sugar Bowl, Texas quarterback Sam Ehlinger said “We’re back.” That may have been a premature reaction, though, as the Longhorns are struggling mightily this season.</p>
      <p>Texas entered this year with hopes of making the College Football Playoff. In the first month of the season, the Longhorns suffered an early loss to the LSU Tigers at home.</p>
      <p>Later in the season, the Texas Longhorns fell short to the Oklahoma Sooners in the Red River Showdown. Even though Tom Herman’s squad picked up two losses early in the season, the media wasn’t too critical since they lost to quality opponents.</p>
      <p>However, the Longhorns are now receiving criticism for how they’ve played in recent weeks. Texas has lost two out of its last three games – with losses coming to Iowa State and TCU.</p>
      <p>During this morning’s edition of <i>College GameDay</i>, David Pollack and Desmond Howard ripped the Longhorns for how this season has played out.</p>
      <p>Pollack is frustrated with Texas’ inability to win games decisively, via <a href="https://247sports.com/college/texas/Article/College-Gameday-Texas-Longhorns-David-Pollack-Desmond-Howard-Tom-Herman-139038610/">247Sports</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Last year Texas beat Oklahoma and last year Texas beat Georgia, and a lot of the talk was about Texas is back,” Pollack said. “You know when Texas is going to be back? When they stop messing around with random opponents they should beat. Sixteen of their last 24 games have been decided by seven points or less.</blockquote>
      <p>As for Howard, he took a subtle shot at the fan base in Texas. He believes the only people confident in the Longhorns are their own fans.</p>
      <blockquote>“No one is talking about Texas being back except the Longhorns fans,” Howard said. “And they’re being hopeful. That’s what that is all about. I don’t know if Baylor is mentally strong enough to come back. I know it’s Texas, in-state rivalry, I get that. But Baylor has to put last week behind them because Texas knows this is still a huge opportunity for the Longhorns.”</blockquote>
      <p>Texas could suffer its fifth loss of the season if it doesn’t come ready to play this afternoon against Baylor.</p>
      <p>Kickoff for that game is at 3:30 p.m. ET from McLane Stadium.</p>
