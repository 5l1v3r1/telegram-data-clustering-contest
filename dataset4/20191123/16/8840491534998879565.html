      <p>A SIGNIFICANT development in the history of primary education in Castlebar has been initiated.</p>
      <p>The county town's two biggest national schools – St. Angela's Girls NS and St. Patrick's Boys NS – have entered a consultation process with a view to achieving co-education status.</p>
      <p>They currently cater for over 760 pupils and 68 staff between them and they are both under the patronage of the Archbishop of Tuam, Dr. Michael Neary.</p>
      <p>A joint statement issued by the two schools to <i>The Connaught Telegraph </i>confirmed the milestone move.</p>
      <p>It stated: “The boards of management of our schools have given consent to an initial process of consultation involving all stakeholders from both school communities.</p>
      <p>“The purpose of this consultation is to gather information, seek opinions and establish what is necessary to enhance the future development of the two schools.</p>
      <p>“The aim is to provide the best educational experience for their existing and prospective students.</p>
      <p>“The consultation will involve input from all stakeholders - boards of management, staff, parents, school patron and the Department of Education and Skills.</p>
      <p>“Any decisions, including the possible restructuring of both schools to provide for co-education, will only be taken following wide and meaningful consultation with all parties involved.</p>
      <p>“Both schools have a great tradition and reputation for providing wonderful, holistic educational experiences for their pupils in a safe and caring environment.</p>
      <p>“It is a priority that the high standards of education which have been their hallmark over many years are maintained and this will be central to the upcoming process.”</p>
      <p>The statement was signed by Úna Lydon, chairperson, board of management, St. Patrick's NS board of management, and Noreen Walsh, chairperson, St. Angela’s NS.</p>
      <p>It is understood the news has been received positively by staff of both schools who were informed of the proposals on Friday.</p>
      <p>However, it is unclear at this point how long the process will take.</p>
      <p>St. Angela's NS, located at the Lawn, was founded in 1852 shortly after the Sister of Mercy set up a convent in Castlebar. It primarily catered for the girls but did, in its early years, teach boys up to the age of nine.</p>
      <p>Today, there are 348 pupils enrolled with a staff of 29.</p>
      <p>St. Patrick's NS, sited at Chapel Street, was founded by the De La Brothers in 1888. It has an enrolment of 415 and a staff of 39.</p>
