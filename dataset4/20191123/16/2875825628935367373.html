      <h1>Liverpool player ratings as from Crystal Palace win as Sadio Mane shines</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool were poor in the first half against former manager Roy Hodgson's Crystal Palace on Saturday but secured the points thanks to Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:53:25+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:53</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Roberto Firmino came to the rescue for Liverpool just six minutes before the end as the Reds ran out 2-1 winners over <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> started poorly against former manager Roy Hodgson's side and were momentarily trailing when James Tomkins headed home on the stroke of half time at Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>VAR was called into action following appeals from Dejan Lovren and it was adjudged the defender was pushed in the back by Jordan Ayew in the build-up to the goal, which was chalked off by Kevin Friend.</p>
      <p>Liverpool finally broke the deadlock in the second half through Mane; the striker bringing down a flicked-on ball from Roberto Firmino to fire past Vicente Guaita.</p>
      <p>Wilfried Zaha looked to have secured a point for Palace with a goal eight minutes before the end but Firmino put Liverpool back in front 180 seconds later to make it 12 wins from 13 for the Reds.</p>
      <p>The win sees Liverpool go 12 points clear of champions Man City ahead of their match with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea.</a></p>
      <p>Here's how we rated the Liverpool performances this Saturday.</p>

      <h3>Liverpool</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Alisson - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>In no man's land for when James Tomkins headed home, only for VAR to save the Brazilian stopper.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alexander-Arnold - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tasked with keeping Wilfried Zaha quiet and seemingly did his job, though was beaten for pace on a number of occasions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dejan Lovren - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Did his job and played a crucial role in Palace's disallowed goal, going down under a weak challenge from Jordan Ayew.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Virgil van Dijk - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>As expected, the Dutch giant was a rock in the heart of Liverpool's defence and regularly attempted to get an attack going.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>Andy Robertson - 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Provided an attacking outlet down the left flank, although Joel Ward dealt well with his threat. Provided the assist for Mane's opener.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jordan Henderson - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Got the midfield ticking with constant movement and rapid passing - a typical captain's performance from the England star.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fabinho - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Did the job that was expected of him, providing a shield for his defence that ultimately allowed his midfield partners to enjoy more freedom.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Georginio Wijnaldum - 6</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Quiet afternoon for the Dutchman and didn't get forward as much as Klopp would have hoped.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Handed a chance to shine in place of Mo Salah, but cut a lonely figure in attack and didn't see much of the ball</p>
      <p>
        <b>Roberto Firmino - 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wasn't the performance we've come to expect from the Brazilian maestro before he popped up with a crucial winner.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sadio Mane - 8 MOTM</b>
      </p>
      <p>Led the line for Liverpool in the absence of Salah and delivered the goods with the opening goal. Stretched Palace's defence all game.</p>
