      <p>She has been hailed as a "heroine for our times" after giving a evidence at the impeachment hearing of Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Formerly the top Russia expert in the White House, Fiona Hill has been applauded around the world for her testimony at the hearings earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Born in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/bishop-auckland">Bishop Auckland</a> , the 54-year-old explained how she was the daughter of a coal miner and moved to the US before becoming a citizen by choice - the real life American dream.</p>
      <p>The committee heard how she grew up with a "very distinctive working-class accent" that she says would have "impeded my professional advancement" if she'd stayed in England.</p>
      <p>And, it wasn't just her impassioned speech which hit the headlines, but also the undertones of her still noticeable North East accent.</p>
      <p>Commentators on Twitter have called her a "bad ass", wished she could be President, demanded a TV mini-series be made of her life, and praised her straight-talking style.</p>
      <p>Andrew Sullivan, writing in the Intelligencer, said he was "gobsmacked" after watching footage of Dr Hill's testimony.</p>
      <p>He added: "As soon as I heard her voice, I thought she was a 'Geordie' - her accent has obviously softened but those flat vowels and clipped consonants are unmistakable to an English ear."</p>
      <p>He added: "Hearing Hill’s still voice of calm in this storm moved me deeply, and not just because she comes from the country of my birth too, but because her immigrant, accented voice revealed an understanding of America in a way this president simply doesn't understand.</p>

      <p>"She knows what’s at stake. And she has done her part. It gives me hope, I guess. Hope that we can, in fact, expose and defeat this malignancy at the heart of our democracy."</p>
      <p>CNN's Luke McGee said Dr Hill was right that her accent would have had a negative impact on her career in the UK.</p>
      <p>He said figures from the Social Mobility Commission revealed a "staggering number of top jobs in the UK" are held by people who are privately educated.</p>
      <p>He said: "In 2019, the world-famous British class system is alive and well."</p>
      <p>A 2014 YouGov survey said a posh accent from the the wealthy South East of England has the highest approval rating of British accent, in contrast to inner city accents from parts of the country like the North East - were the most disliked, he wrote.</p>
      <p>Dr Hill's father, Alfred Hill, went down the pits at the age of 14 with his father, uncles and cousins, and her widowed mother, a retired midwife, still lives in Bishop Auckland.</p>
      <p>During her speech she confirmed a story about a boy setting fire to her pigtails when she was 11, while she was taking a school test, and she calmly put the flames out and carried out with the exam.</p>
      <p>In 2016 she told The Guardian newspaper about trying to win a place at Oxford University in the 1980s and compared it to a scene from the film Billy Elliot, which features a schoolboy from County Durham attending the Royal Ballet School.</p>

      <p>But history writer Dan Jackson, author of the best-selling book The Northumbrians: North-East England And Its People, questioned whether a Geordie accent was still a block to success in the way Dr Hill surmised.</p>
      <p>He said: "If you look at Ant and Dec, it's not held them back, they have been voted Britain's most popular entertainers 18 years running.</p>
      <p>"I'm sure part of their appeal is that people like their accents."  </p>
      <p>The writer also addressed the vexatious question of whether, as someone from County Durham, she was correctly labelled as having a Geordie accent, because some believe the term only refers to people born in Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Until recently, he said, people from Sunderland were also called Geordies, not just those from Newcastle - and the author said those from Northumberland or County Durham could make a claim to that name if they wanted.</p>
      <p>He said: "There's no consensus on it, no arbitrating authority.</p>
      <p>"It's a matter of self-identity."</p>
      <p>The Mayor of Bishop Auckland, Councillor Joy Allen, described her as a "shining light".</p>
      <p>She added: "I cannot imagine what it must have been like for her, to go out and give evidence when the world was watching.</p>
      <p>"She must have nerves of steel.</p>
      <p>"She came across so well, so honest and so trustworthy.</p>
      <p>"It is great for the North East, great for northern women, and she is a really great role model.</p>
      <p>"I am really proud of her coming from Bishop Auckland and doing so well."</p>
