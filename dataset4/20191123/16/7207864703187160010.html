      <p><b>Key point: </b>The Navy is constantly upgrading its ships to ensure they have the best technology for any fight.</p>
      <p>WASHINGTON – The U.S. Navy has laid the keel for its first new Flight III Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, which is armed with improved weapons, advanced sensors, and new <a href="https://www.militaryaerospace.com/sensors/article/14036359/surface-warships-radar-anspy6">radar</a> 35-times more sensitive than most current systems.

      <p>The Military &amp; Aerospace Electronics take:</p>
      <p>22 Nov. 2019 -- The Navy <a href="https://www.militaryaerospace.com/sensors/article/14039731/destroyers-radar-laser-weapons">Flight III destroyer</a> has new technologies like more on-board <a href="https://www.militaryaerospace.com/power">power</a> for laser weapons, new engines, improved electronics, fast upgradable software, and a powerful new radar. The Flight III Destroyers will be able to see and destroy a much wider range of enemy targets at long distances.</p>
      <p>The ship, the guided missile destroyer USS Jack H. Lucas (DDG 125), is the first of many Flight III destroyers the Navy plans to build. Its new radar and fire control system, called Aegis Baseline 10, will enable the ship to combine air-warfare and ballistic missile defense into one system.</p>
      <p>The AN/SPY-6 radar, previously called Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR), is engineered to locate and discriminate several different tracks simultaneously, says Scott Spence, director for naval radar systems at the Raytheon Co. Integrated Defense Systems segment in Tewksbury, Mass.</p>
