      <p>A late double from Gonzalo Higuain helped Juventus come from behind to beat Atalanta 3-1 in Bergamo on Saturday and go four points clear at the top of the Serie A standings.</p>

      <p>But Higuain struck twice in the final 16 minutes to turn the game on its head before Paulo Dybala sealed the points with a late strike.</p>
      <p>Juventus coach Maurizio Sarri was without Cristiano Ronaldo for the trip to the Gewiss Stadium as the Portuguese forward recovers from a knee problem ahead of Tuesdayâ€™s Champions League meeting with Atletico Madrid in Turin.</p>

      <p>Atalanta are sixth on 22 points and have now gone four games without a league win.</p>
