      <h1>Prince Andrew accuser gives new Jeffrey Epstein details in first UK interview</h1>
      <h2>Virginia Giuffre's interview with BBC Panorama in which she talks about Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, and billionaire financial Jeffrey Epstein, will air on BBC One on December 2</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:38:15+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:38</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>A woman who claims Prince Andrew had sex with her after she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein is expected to double down on the allegations, which Andrew denies, in an upcoming TV interview.</p>
      <p>A further public relations blow could be dealt to Prince Andrew when an interview with Virginia Giuffre is aired in just ten days time.</p>
      <p>Giuffre's conversation with BBC One's Panorama will hit the screens at 8.30pm on December 2.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old is expected to use the interview to restate her claim that the Duke of York had sex with her when she was 17 after she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

      <p>While the contents of the interview are not yet public, it is safe to assume they will focus on topics covered in the Prince's hugely damaging interview with Newsnight's Emily Maitlis.</p>
      <p>During the almost hour long conversation Prince Andrew claimed he had not had sex with Ms Giuffre on one of the day's she alleges - March 10, 2001 - and was instead in Pizza Express in Woking.</p>
      <p>He also argued her description of him dancing away sweatily in London's Tramps nightclub could not be true, as a medical condition stemming from a near miss during the Falkland's War meant he was unable to perspire.</p>

      <p>Although the first interview Ms Giuffre gave was filmed before the Newsnight episode was transmitted, she has since given her reaction to the Prince's claims.</p>
      <p>It is unlikely that Ms Giuffre, who alleges that she was procured by the daughter of disgraced tycoon Robert Maxwell to be Epstein's teenage sex slave, which she denies, will pull any punches during the show.</p>
      <p>She released a manuscript just hours before Epstein's death in his prison cell, which added to more than 2,000 documents of a lawsuit pending against the former financier and his pals.</p>
      <p>At the time of his death the financier was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p>

      <p>Ms Giuffre has has also stood by her accusations that Andrew had sex with her three times between 1999 and 2001 in the face of repeated denials by the Prince and vocal support from Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>She has said Prince Andrew "was an abuser, he was a participant," accusing him of having sex with her as part of a nine woman orgy on Little St James island in the Virgin Islands.</p>
      <p>In a Florida court in 2015 Ms Giuffre alleged: "Epstein, Andy, approximately eight other young girls and I had sex together.</p>

      <p>"The other girls all seemed and appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn’t really speak English.</p>
      <p>"Epstein laughed about the fact they couldn’t really communicate, saying that they are the ‘easiest’ girls to get along with.”</p>
      <p>During the Newsnight interview the Duke denied ever knowing Ms Giuffre.</p>
      <p>“I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever,” the 59-year-old said.</p>
      <p>“It just never happened.”</p>

      <p>Prince Andrew's denial,  along with the admission that his friendship with convicted sex-trafficker Epstein had "beneficial outcomes", did not lead to a clearing of the air that he had hoped for.</p>
      <p>Instead he faced a swift and ferocious public backlash, which included organisations such as the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra choosing to part ways with the patron.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday he officially stepped away from public duties, explaining that it had "become clear" to him that "my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work."</p>
      <p>He went on to express sympathy for the victims of the convicted sex offender and disgraced financier, saying he "hoped they could rebuild their lives."</p>
