      <h1>Dems more focused on resisting than legislating, says Charlie Hurt</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:34:28+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:34</time> by <a rel="author">Julia Musto</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/democrats">Democratic resistance</a> from the Golden State is coming at a high price tag, Fox News contributor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/charlie-hurt-nancy-pelosi-impeachment-hearings-huge-loser-fox-friends">Charlie Hurt</a> said Saturday.</p>
      <p>Appearing on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">"Fox &amp; Friends: Weekend"</a> with host Ed Henry, Hurt said the resistance was costing Democrats more than just money.</p>
      <p>In less than three years, the more than 60 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-files-50th-lawsuit-against-trump-administration-in-case-over-union-dues">lawsuits</a> filed by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california">California</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-ags-anti-trump-lawsuits-have-cost-taxpayers-21m-state-gop-says">Attorney General Xavier Becerra</a> against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house">Trump administration</a> have cost state taxpayers $21 million.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Since Trump took office in 2017, Becerra has sued the administration over issues including the president's <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-travel-ban-30000-people-blocked-muslim-state-department">travel ban</a>, protecting <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/daca">DACA</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/sanctuary-cities">sanctuary cities</a>, fighting family separations at the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/border-security">U.S.-Mexico border</a> and plans to construct the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/border-wall">border wall</a>, according to FOX 40 of Sacramento.</p>
      <p>As of last May, California has gotten favorable rulings in at least 25 of the cases, <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/05/14/california-lawsuits-trump-administration-xavier-becerra-50-times/">The Mercury News</a> of San Jose reported.</p>

      <p>"It underscores this thing that we're seeing more and more with Democrats these days -- they really would rather posture than actually legislate and it's not just in California," said Hurt.</p>
      <p>He told Henry that in examining this <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">"crazy impeachment pursuit,"</a>  House Democrats "have issued more subpoenas in order to pin something on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> than they have passed legislation that has gone on to become laws."</p>
      <p>"And you have perfectly good legislation that would pass the House, pass the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate">Senate</a> -- like the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/canada">Canada</a>-<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/location-mexico">Mexico</a> trade deal -- Democrats refuse to bring it up because they would rather spend all this time talking about impeachment," said Hurt.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/nancy-pelosi">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a>, D-Calif., is now saying that the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-has-just-revolutionized-global-trade-by-replacing-nafta-with-usmca">USMCA deal</a> won't come up again in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress">Congress</a> till 2020.</p>

      <p>"But, when you look at the number of these cases...[they're] way beyond principle into simply trying to make a brute political point that I think wouldn't even float in regular Democratic circles much less <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election">general election</a> circles," he concluded.</p>
