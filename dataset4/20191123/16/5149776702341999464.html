      <h1>Center Parcs CEO 'draws breath' after opening sixth resort - but doesn't rule out building another</h1>
      <h2>'I’d like to think we could maybe build another one in the UK'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:58:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:58</time> by <a rel="author">Laura Hammond</a></address>
      <p>It’s a well-known brand with holiday villages across the UK, but Center Parcs remains a proud Nottinghamshire company at heart.</p>
      <p>The first Center Parcs actually opened in the Netherlands in 1968 but the UK division was founded in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a> in 1987 with the holiday village in Sherwood Forest.</p>
      <p>Back then, the company was supported by a small office on Maid Marian Way in the middle of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-city-centre">Nottingham city centre</a> .</p>
      <p>Fast forward 32 years to today, and the firm has six holiday villages across the UK – Sherwood Forest, Elveden Forest in Suffolk, Longleat Forest in Wiltshire, Whinfell Forest in Cumbria, Woburn Forest in Bedfordshire, and Longford Forest in County Longford in Ireland.</p>
      <p>Each village is home to a Subtropical Swimming Paradise, shops, restaurants and a spa.</p>
      <p>Across the UK, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/center-parcs">Center Parcs</a> employs 9,623 people – of which 2,126 work in Nottinghamshire at either Sherwood Forest or the company’s headquarters in Ollerton.</p>
      <p>That figure includes three people who have been with the company since the opening of the Sherwood Forest holiday village more than 30 years ago.</p>
      <p>In 2019, the company saw profits increase by three per cent and boasted a turnover of £480m – an increase of four per cent on the previous year – which, according to chief executive Martin Dalby, puts Center Parcs "in the big league".</p>
      <p>He said: "It was another good, satisfying year for us despite the challenges of Brexit. The hot weather last summer was challenging as well."</p>
      <p>Mr Dalby, who has worked at Center Parcs for 25 years, believes the company owes its success to the "uniqueness" of the experience it offers.</p>
      <p>He said: "In the UK market there’s really no one like us. We are unique in that respect.</p>

      <p>"We’ve got a brand, we are trusted, people know they get a good experience at Center Parcs.</p>
      <p>"Many of our customers have been many, many times. Something like 30% come back every year. If you went out to Sherwood Forest and had a look around, something like 60% have been there in the last five years."</p>
      <p>This year has been huge for Center Parcs in terms of investment and growth.</p>
      <p>In March, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/take-ride-through-center-parcs-2610231">The Tropical Cyclone ride</a> officially opened at the Sherwood Forest Subtropical Swimming Paradise.</p>
      <p>The 125-metre ride was the centre piece of a £15m investment into the facility, which also included a brand new family play area.</p>
      <p>This year, the company also invested in a range of improvements across five of its holiday villages – for example, refurbishing shops and upgrading restaurants.</p>
      <p>"It’s about continually reinvesting the profits to maintain high quality. It’s also about innovation as well," said Mr Dalby.</p>
      <p>The company’s biggest moment of 2019 came in July with the opening of its sixth holiday village, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/center-parcs-opens-newest-holiday-3117959">Longford Forest</a> .</p>
      <p>The 395-acre site in Newcastle Wood, County Longford in Ireland, is home to 460 self-catering lodges, plus all the usual Center Parcs offerings.</p>
      <p>The opening of Longford Forest means Center Parcs now offers 4,813 units of accommodation – including apartments and self-catering lodges - across the UK.</p>

      <p>The growth of Center Parcs over the years is something Mr Dalby takes particular pride in.</p>
      <p>He said: "I have seen massive growth in the business – the acquisition of Whinfell, the building and opening of Woburn, the whole transformation of that business in that time.</p>
      <p>"We’re a very big business. In the many places where we are located, we are the biggest employer. We support the local community with a community fund in each village. There’s a massive amount that we do.</p>
      <p>"We’ve created a very sustainable business."</p>
      <p>Mr Dalby described Center Parcs as a "very strong and very stable" business that’s "very proud to be part of the Nottinghamshire scene".</p>
      <p>However, he said: "I think you can always do better. You should never, in business, stand still and say 'we’re fantastic'.</p>
      <p>"You have to be in continuous improvement mode. [At] Center Parcs, it’s about maintaining the high level facilities."</p>
      <p>Looking to the future, Mr Dalby said Center Parcs is set to make "a huge amount of investment" in technology across its villages in order to "keep abreast of the market".</p>
      <p>He also raised the possibility of opening another holiday village in the UK.</p>
      <p>He said: "We’ve come out of Ireland a few weeks ago. We’re drawing a bit of breath now.</p>
      <p>"I think nothing really changes, we continue to invest in the product, refurbish and improve the quality, invest and train our staff.</p>
      <p>"We will have a look at the market and say, 'Where do we go next? Where do we build another place?' I’d like to think we could maybe build another one in the UK."</p>
      <p>
        <i>Center Parcs was ranked ninth in this year's <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/live-updates-nottinghamshires-top-200-3475742">Top 200</a>, which ranks businesses by turnover.</i>
