      <p>Christine McGuinness cheered on Liverpool this afternoon, with her three children also getting into the spirit.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/christine-mcguinness-left-really-sad-17194648">Christine s</a> hared a photo of her and the kids dressed in their Liverpool kits, as the Reds took on Crystal Palace away.</p>
      <p>The Halewood native and Leo, Penelope and Felicity looked to be enjoying their own game of football before Liverpool kicked off.</p>
      <p>The children can be seen holding footballs in the air, while Christine, 31, stood in a makeshift goal in the hallway.</p>
      <p>She captioned the cute post: "Kiddies making up their own rules, whatever keeps them happy! ❤️⚽</p>

      <p>Liverpool beat Crystal Palace 2-1 <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/crystal-palace-vs-liverpool-live-17294134">after a last minute goal from Roberto Firmino</a>.</p>
      <p>Christine and husband Paddy have been very open about their children's autism condition, regularly sharing updates of how their condition affects their lives.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year the family were able to enjoy <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/christine-mcguinness-shares-sweet-snaps-16885492">their first holiday abroad</a> - with the kids wearing their beloved Liverpool kits for the plane journey.</p>
      <p>The Real Housewives of Cheshire star has previously talked about <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/proud-parents-christine-paddy-mcguinness-16685549">how the trip was "six years in the making"</a> and how they practised by taking their children, two of whom have been diagnosed with autism, on a short flight to Southampton.</p>

      <p>The trip was a success and Christine posted at the time: "I don’t think it will be long until we have our first holiday abroad!"</p>
      <p>And sure enough she posted photos of the holiday tweeting: "Finally, our first family holiday abroad!</p>
      <p>"I am so immensely proud of my three babies, they coped so well. Such a magical weekend.</p>
      <p>"Lots of photos to follow, sorry for the 'holiday spam'. I am just the proudest mummy!"</p>
