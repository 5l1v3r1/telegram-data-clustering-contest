        <b>Liverpool’s Dejan Lovren was deemed to have been pushed by Crystal Palace’s Jordan Ayew as James Tomkins saw his opener from a corner chalked off by VAR.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Liverpool were on the lucky end of another decision from VAR, this time against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>The Eagles thought they had taken the lead just before half time of this afternoon’s Premier League clash.</p>
      <p>But the Premier League leaders escaped following the intervention of the technology and officials.</p>
      <p>James Tomkins tapped the ball in at the far post from a corner.</p>
      <p>However, it was decided that Jordan Ayew had intervened enough in the build up to the goal.</p>
      <p>Ayew was deemed to have pushed defender Dejan Lovren over when the ball came in.</p>
      <p>Fans of rival clubs were left raging as Jurgen Klopp’s title chasers have been seen to receive some favourable decisions with tight VAR calls this term.</p>
      <p>An Arsenal fan tweeted: “liVARpool”.</p>
      <p>And another said: “liverpool cheating as per”.</p>
      <p>A Man Utd fan said: “Had to be. It just had to be”</p>
      <p>A Man City fan: “Name a more iconic duo”.</p>
      <p>And another posted: “Let’s not bother. This league is an embarrassment to the sport.”</p>
      <p>A Chelsea branded VAR: “Corrupt”.</p>
      <p>And another suggested: “See the meeting went well then”.</p>
      <p>The call from VAR proved pivotal as Liverpool took the lead shortly after the restart.</p>
      <p>Sadio Mane's strike counted at the other end just after the second half.</p>
      <p>The Tomkins decision, meanwhile, left Paul Merson seething in the Sky Sports studio as he commentated on the match.</p>
