      <p>WeWork Chairman Marcelo Claure shared his pasta tasting at a high-end Italian restaurant on social media a day after the embattled startup began <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-lays-off-2400-employees-2019-11">massive layoffs</a>.</p>
      <p>In his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/marceloclaure/">Instagram</a> stories, Claure posted a photo of the $110-per-person tasting menu at Michelin-starred <a href="https://www.babbonyc.com/">Babbo</a> with the caption “pasta overdose.” A subsequent video from the Greenwich Village, New York City restaurant shows various plates laid out on his table, including a serving of olive oil cake and gelato.</p>
      <p>Celebrity chef Mario Batali and TV personality Joe Bastianich opened the establishment in 1998; Batali <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/dining/mario-batali-bastianich-restaurants.html">ended his partnership</a> with the restaurant earlier this year after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment.</p>
      <p>The New York Times’ Amy Chozick <a href="https://twitter.com/amychozick/status/1198242338612473856">tweeted</a> a screenshot from Claure’s Instagram stories, saying that he just laid off thousands of employees “right before Thanksgiving.”</p>

      <p>The embattled startup confirmed Thursday that it was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-lays-off-2400-employees-2019-11">laying off 2,400 employees</a> – about 20% of its global workforce – following its failed initial public offering.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the office-sharing company was privately valued at $47 billion, making it America’s most valuable startup. But after it filed documents to go public, intense <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/weworks-nightmare-ipo">scrutiny of its financials and leadership</a> slashed its valuation in half and put the IPO on ice.</p>
      <p>SoftBank, one of WeWork’s primary investors, eventually offered a $9.5 billion package for majority ownership in the company. This included giving WeWork cofounder and former CEO Adam Neumann a $1.7 billion deal in exchange for his departure.</p>
      <p>SoftBank also installed Claure as WeWork’s executive chairman with a mandate to oversee the company’s turnaround.</p>
      <p>At an all-hands meeting on Friday, Claure outlined six “pillars” of focus for the company moving forward. They included becoming the partner of choice for WeWork members and operating “with a cash-conscious-owner mentality,” Business Insider’s Meghan Morris <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-staff-meeting-after-layoffs-path-to-profitability-new-executives-2019-11">reported</a>.</p>
