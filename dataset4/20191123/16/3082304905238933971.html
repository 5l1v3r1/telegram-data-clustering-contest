        <b>Manchester City lost away to Liverpool without injured goalkeeper Ederson, but he is back for Saturday’s home game against Chelsea.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ederson is back in the Manchester City side to face Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The goalkeeper missed City’s last game, a 3-1 defeat at Liverpool that left the champions nine points behind Jurgen Klopp’s Reds in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Ederson was withdrawn during a Champions League draw with Atalanta this month due to a thigh injury, with Kyle Walker ending the game in goal after Claudio Bravo was sent off.</p>
      <p>The Brazil international has, as expected, been passed fit for a crunch clash with Chelsea, with Frank Lampard’s side having won six straight Premier League games to move up to third in the league, above City.</p>
      <p>Bernardo Silva is out after being banned for one game for his controversial tweet about team-mate Benjamin Mendy, while Raheem Sterling starts after being dropped for England’s 7-0 win over Montenegro during the international break following an incident with Liverpool defender Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>David Silva also returns to midfield, having been an unused substitute against Liverpool, while Riyad Mahrez starts alongside Sterling and Sergio Aguero.</p>
      <p>Joao Cancelo, John Stones, Fernandinho and Mendy line up in defence.</p>

      <p>Chelsea make two changes from a victory over Crystal Palace as they aim to win eight consecutive away games in all competitions for the first time in their history.</p>
      <p>Jorginho replaces Mason Mount in midfield and Cesar Azpilicueta comes in for Reece James at full-back.</p>
