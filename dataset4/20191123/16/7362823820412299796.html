      <p>Over two hours later at around 7:40 p.m, the Washington County Sheriff’s Office was contacted by park officials to report “an individual who fell from the Angels Landing trail.”</p>
      <p>The following day, at around daybreak, search and rescue teams recovered a body. The victim was later identified as McTague, a resident of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/maine">Maine</a>.</p>
      <p>A news release from the park said her body was found at the base of the trail and her injuries were consistent with a "high elevation fall.”</p>
      <p>It's not immediately clear what may have caused McTague to fall but the trail was previously closed and then reopened because of a rockfall. Park officials warned hikers to be careful on the trail due to a winter storm moving into the area.</p>

      <p>“Our deepest condolences go out to the McTague family and friends,” park superintendent Jeff Bradybaugh said in a press release obtained by St. George News. “Savannah was part of the Zion family. This fatality has been especially hard on Zion Lodge and park staff.”</p>
      <p>The Utah state website describes Angels Landing as “one of the world's most renowned hikes” with “steep switchbacks and sheer drop-offs.” Hikers walk the trail using chain handholds that are bolted into the cliffs. The highest peak is around 1,488 feet.</p>
