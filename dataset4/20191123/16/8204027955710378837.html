      <p>HARRISON TWP. — A Montgomery County Sheriff’s detective will not face criminal charges in the shooting of a juvenile who reportedly tried to hit the detective with a vehicle in Harrison Twp., according to a grand jury report.</p>
      <p>On Aug. 30, a juvenile male was driving dangerously around 50-60 miles per hour through a residential neighborhood, Sheriff Streck previously told News Center 7.</p>
      <p>Deputies lost sigh of vehicle, which was reported as stolen, but found it shortly after in an apartment parking lot.</p>
      <p>When the detective got out of his cruiser, the juvenile tried to run over or hit the detective, Streck said.</p>
      <p>The detective shot at the juvenile as a result.</p>
      <p>The juvenile drove away, prompting a low-speed chase, which ended in a second apartment complex parking lot off Riverside Drive.</p>
      <p>Once the juvenile got out of the vehicle, deputies realized he had a gunshot wound.</p>
      <p>His injuries did not seem life-threatening, said Streck. The juvenile was taken to a local hospital for treatment.</p>
