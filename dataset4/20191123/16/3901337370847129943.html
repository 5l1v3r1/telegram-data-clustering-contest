      <p>The Portuguese tactician went for Dele Alli, Lucas Moura and Heung-min Son behind Harry Kane as Christian Eriksen and Moussa Sissoko started on the bench.</p>
      <p>There was a lively start to the encounter, but the first real opening arrived after 19 minutes when Son worked some space outside the box before unleashing powerful effort that was palmed away by Hammers shot-stopper Roberto.</p>
      <p>However, Son was not to be denied on 36 minutes when as the South Korean got the first goal of the Mourinho era with a finish from close range although Morena should have done better with his attempted save.</p>
      <p>The lead was doubled shortly before the halftime break as Son turned provider to pick out Lucas at the far post and the Brazilian had the simple task of slotting home.</p>
      <p>Kane got in on the act four minutes after the halftime break with a neat header past Roberto from Serge Aurier's pinpoint cross on the right flank.</p>
      <p>The Hammers did manage to pull a goal back with 15 minutes remaining in the stanza as substitute Michail Antonio sent a powerful past Paulo Gazzaniga after being played in by Mark Noble.</p>
      <p>The hosts had the ball in the back of the net on 90 minutes through Declan Rice, but the goal was ruled out by the Video Assistant Referee.</p>
      <p>West Ham were not denied in the final minute of the game when Angelo Ogbonna fired home from close range to make it 3-2, but Spurs were able to hold on for the win.</p>
