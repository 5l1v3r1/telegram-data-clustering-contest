      <p>Update 11/23/2019 4:28pm:</p>
      <p>According to reports, a new form of birth control for males that is supposed to last 13 years has completed a successful clinical trial and may be available in the next six months.</p>
      <p>Scientists in India say, “The trials are over, including extended, phase 3 clinical trials for which 303 candidates were recruited with 97.3% success rate and no reported side-effects.” The scientists noted the birth control compound called Styrene Maleic Anhydride will be injected into the groin, which will block sperm from leaving the testicles. Manufacturers of the new birth control are currently awaiting approval from the Drug Controller General of India, which could reportedly take 6 to 7 months. The form of birth control is was made to be a form of replacement to a vasectomy procedure.</p>

      <p>An experimental male birth control pill is reportedly safe according to multiple sources. Ironically it caused men to gain weight-- the same side effect some female birth control pills have. At this time, it's unclear how these male contraceptives actually work.</p>
      <p>“Our last great advance in male contraception was 300 years ago with the development of the condom", said Stephanie Page of the University of Washington School of Medicine.</p>
      <p>Researchers are also unsure whether it decreases sperm production or stops couples from conceiving. Page's team tested 100 male volunteers and received good results from 82 of them. There were also no major side effects with the exception of low testosterone levels.</p>
