      <h1>T-Mobile says some prepaid customers' info affected by breach</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:16:32+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/tal-axelrod" target="_blank">Tal Axelrod</a></address>
      <p>T-Mobile disclosed Friday that a hacker gained access to information such as billing addresses and phone numbers from prepaid user accounts.</p>
      <p>The mobile network said it discovered the breach earlier this month and that it impacted less than 1.5 percent of T-Mobile customers before being shut down by the company’s cybersecurity team.</p>
      <p>The information that was hacked included names, billing addresses and phone numbers. T-Mobile assured customers that no financial data was included in the hack and that no passwords were compromised.</p>
      <p>“Our Cybersecurity team discovered and shut down malicious, unauthorized access to some information related to your T-Mobile prepaid wireless account. We promptly reported this to authorities. None of your financial data (including credit card information) or social security numbers was involved, and no passwords were compromised,” T-Mobile said <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/customers/6305378822">in a statement</a>.</p>
      <p>“We take the security of your information very seriously and have a number of safeguards in place to protect your personal information from unauthorized access. We truly regret that this incident occurred and apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you,” it added.</p>
      <p>Tech companies have been under intense scrutiny for accessing the private data of users and taking allegedly insufficient action to protect that data from hacks.</p>
