      <p>It’s Saturday, and if you’re lucky enough to not be working, you’re likely in a pub.</p>
      <p>Am I envious? Of course not. I love staring at a screen and adjusting my desk chair while the rest of you are getting rounds in.</p>
      <p>Anyway. If the pub-going people among us are in need of a team mascot, might we suggest Eli, a delightful ginger cat who absolutely loves going to his local.</p>
      <p>Eli regularly attends the Brewdog near his home in Liverpool, heading down to enjoy a glass of lactose-free milk with his best drinking buddy (and owner), veterinary student Molly.</p>
      <p>Molly often takes Eli out on a lead, and when she heard that Brewdog allowed pets, she decided to bring her kitty down.</p>
      <p>Turns out he loved the place, and now turns up all the time.</p>

      <p>Being a cat in a place where cats usually do not hang out, Eli gets quite a lot of attention when he goes for a drink.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Thankfully he loves all the fuss, happily snuggling up on a chair and accepting treats from other pub-goers.</p>
      <p>Molly said: ‘He always gets a lot of attention when he goes out.</p>
      <p>‘Everyone always gets so excited when they see a cat on the end of a lead.</p>

      <p>‘Most people see the lead and assume it’s a dog. It’s great to watch their faces when they realise it’s a cat.</p>
      <p>‘I’ll invite them to come over and say hello and they get so excited.</p>
      <p>‘Luckily Eli loves the attention – I think he’s the most sociable cat ever.</p>
      <p>‘He hasn’t let the attention go to his head though.’</p>

        <figcaption>Oh, hi (Picture: Mercury Press &amp; Media)</figcaption>

      <p>Eli is such a regular that he’s gained some fame, with hundreds of followers <a href="https://www.instagram.com/elitheadventurecat/">on his Instagram</a> (where he does more than just lounge around the pub, FYI).</p>
      <p>He recently turned up at the vets for a procedure and was recognised by a member of staff.</p>
      <p>Molly, who is living in Liverpool while studying veterinary medicine, adopted Eli when he was eight weeks old.</p>

        <figcaption>He’s slowly getting Instagram famous (Picture: Mercury Press &amp; Media)</figcaption>

      <p>Knowing the risks of letting him out and about in a busy city, she decided Eli would be an indoor cat, and started taking him for walks on a harness and lead so he could get plenty of exercise.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>They started out adventuring in the countryside, but when Molly headed into the city she began taking her ginger pal out to local spots.</p>
      <p>His first trip to a bar happened when Molly had been planning to meet some student friends for a few drinks and hadn’t wanted to leave the cat at home by himself.</p>
      <p>She brought him along, he loved the atmosphere, and since then they often head to Brewdog to crack open a cold one.</p>
      <p>‘Eli’s so used to going out, he loves it,’ says Molly.</p>

      <p>‘Whenever I get his lead, he gets excited, almost like a dog, and runs to the front door.</p>
      <p>‘He’s one of a kind and definitely enjoys coming with us to pubs and bars as he can sit and survey the room.</p>
      <p>‘I knew Brewdog was pet-friendly, so I didn’t think twice taking him in there.</p>
      <p>‘He had to get used to all the different sights and sounds, but as soon as he learned where they were coming from he wasn’t fazed.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t think anyone else in the pub expected a cat to turn up though.</p>

      <p>‘The staff are great, they even have lactose free milk behind the bar, so he can have a little drink with me.’</p>
