      <p>Other than what was mentioned, there is no other information in regards to the Malaysia release date, local price as well as exact tech specs for now. With all that said, do take every bit of information with a grain of salt, due to the fact that Samsung has not released any statement in regards to the Samsung Galaxy A81.
