      <p>Drake’s dad, Dennis Graham, is set to launch his own <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> show as he looks for love.</p>
      <p>Go get ’em!</p>
      <p>The drummer and his business partner David Weintraub are reportedly signing a deal in the coming week, after meetings with various networks including Vice and WE tv.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/23/drake-dad-dennis-graham-dating-show-reality-tv-bachelor/">According to TMZ</a>, the show will follow Dennis as he searches for love, as well as giving viewers a glimpse into what it’s like to be the God’s Plan hitmaker’s dad.</p>

      <p>However, things haven’t been that friendly between the pair recently, with Dennis, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/08/01/dennis-graham-drakes-dad-has-finally-released-his-music-video-and-its-kinda-crazy-6821019/">who’s been releasing music of his own since 2017</a>, accusing Drake of lying about their relationship in his music.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Nick Cannon’s talk show on Power 106, Dennis suggested that Drake had sensationalised the pair’s relationship to ‘sell records’.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘I have always been with Drake. I talked to him, if not every day, every other day, and we really got into a deep conversation about that.</p>
      <p>‘I said, “Drake, why are you saying all of this different stuff about me, man? This is not cool,” and then he goes, “Dad, it sells records.”‘</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/drake-says-hurt-dad-dennis-graham-accusing-lying-relationship-music-10885891/">Drake denied the claims, saying he was ‘so hurt’ by his dad’s words.</a></p>

      <p>‘Woke up today so hurt man,’ he wrote on Instagram. ‘My father will say anything to anyone that’s willing to listen to him. It’s sad when family gets like this, but what can we really do – that’s the people we are stuck with.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘Every bar I ever spit was the truth. And the truth is hard for some people to accept.’</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the pair have appeared to get along in the past, with Drake penning a sweet birthday message for his dad on his birthday just a few weeks before the row.</p>
      <p>‘Happy Birthday to the real superstar of the family @therealdennisg show some love to the OG,’ he wrote.</p>
      <p>Let’s hope they settle things soon.</p>
