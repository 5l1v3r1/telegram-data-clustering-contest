      <p><a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Fantastic-Four-66857.html"><i>Fantastic Four</i></a> director Josh Trank should give himself an extra star for self-awareness and self-deprecating humor. I don't really know why he chose this moment to review his much-maligned 2015 Fox Marvel movie on Letterboxd, but not only did he do that, he tweeted out a link to it (then made it his Pinned Tweet) as a statement to the world.</p>

      <p>Josh Trank gave his "Fant4stic" movie two stars, which is one more than most critics. <i>Fantastic Four</i> has a 9% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 254 critics and an 18% audience score from 137,571 users.</p>
      <p>The whole review is spot-on. If <i>Fantastic Four</i> had been as fun to watch as the director's review is to read, there wouldn't be a problem. Here's <a href="https://letterboxd.com/joshuatrank/film/fantastic-four/">just a portion</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The movie is ALRIGHT.<br/>I was expecting it to be much worse than it was. I literally haven’t seen it since like two weeks before it came out, and I was in a heavily fucking traumatized state of mind. Why? Eh, save that for another time.<br/>Anyway, movie review:<br/>Great cast.<br/>Everyone in the film is a great actor, and overall there is a movie in there, somewhere. And that cast deserves to be in THAT movie. Everyone who worked on Fant4stic clearly wanted to be making THAT movie. But.... ultimately... It wasn’t.</blockquote>
      <p>That's when Josh Trank gets reflective, trying to figure out if he made the movie the cast deserved to be in or not.</p>
      <blockquote>What I can tell is there are TWO different movies in one movie competing to be that movie.<br/>Is there a #releasethetrankcut?<br/>Doesn’t matter.<br/>I’m not Zack Snyder.<br/>Zack Snyder is a storied, iconic, legendary filmmaker who has been knocking it out of the fucking park since I was in high school.<br/>Me? Then?<br/>I was 29 years old, making my 2nd film, in a situation more complicated than anything a 2nd time filmmaker should’ve walked into.</blockquote>
      <p>Josh Trank came to <i>Fantastic Four</i> after directing the well-received 2012 movie <i>Chronicle</i>, which also co-starred Michael B. Jordan. However, Trank adds in his review that he doesn't regret any of the <i>Fantastic Four</i> experience. It's a part of him and his story.</p>
      <blockquote>And I just hope Peyton Reed makes the next <i>Fantastic Four</i> and crushes it. And that I get a cameo.</blockquote>
      <p>That's it, other than his own version of a post-credits scene -- a P.S. noting his girlfriend said he should’ve reviewed more of the film and less about himself. His answer? A shrug emoji.</p>
      <p>To me, that's a four-star review for a movie that ... well, yeah, it deserved to be rated 2 stars at best. He's right to rate it low, but now that almost five years have gone by, time has healed the wounds enough for fans to be more magnanimous.</p>
      <p><i>Fantastic Four</i> had a lot of <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Did-Fantastic-Four-Director-Really-Go-Off-Crew-Destroy-Production-House-69164.html">problems behind-the-scenes</a>. After the harsh reviews started coming out, Josh Trank <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Josh-Trank-Responds-Fantastic-Four-Criticism-75827.html">tweeted that, a year before the release</a>, he had a fantastic version of the movie that would've gotten great reviews ... but you'll probably never see it.</p>
      <p>So maybe that's why he's doing this now -- piggybacking on the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484990/gal-gadot-and-ben-affleck-join-justice-league-co-stars-to-support-snyder-cut-release">#ReleaseTheSnyderCut wave</a> that may actually help Zack Snyder get his cut of <i>Justice League</i> on HBO Max or wherever.</p>
      <p>Josh Trank has kept a light attitude about <i>Fantastic Four</i> in the past few years. When <i>Captain Marvel</i> had a big opening and someone tweeted that no superhero movie fails, Josh Trank replied with a <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2468168/fantastic-four-directors-perfect-tweet-reminds-us-superhero-movies-can-fail">perfect "hold my beer" response</a>. He also <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2469316/fantastic-four-director-just-keeps-trashing-his-movie">dragged himself shortly after that</a> to promote <i>Us</i>.</p>
      <p>At least <i>Fantastic Four</i> isn't the biggest box office bomb of Marvel's Fox universe, since it was recently dethroned for that unfortunate title <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476120/dark-phoenix-set-to-end-run-a-bigger-box-office-bomb-than-fantastic-four">by <i>Dark Phoenix</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Will Josh Trank get his wish, and <i>Ant-Man</i> director Peyton Reed will make the next <i>Fantastic Four</i> movie? After the Disney/Fox deal, Marvel's <i>Fantastic Four</i> characters are now part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476881/kevin-feige-hints-marvel-phase-5-will-bring-in-x-men-and-fantastic-four">hinted to the <i>Fantastic Four</i> in Phase 5</a>, so we'll have to see where things go from here.</p>
