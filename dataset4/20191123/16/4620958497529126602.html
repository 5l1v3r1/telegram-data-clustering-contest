      <p>The awards were handed out Monday night in a formal celebration at the Musqueam Community Centre in Vancouver. The Indigenous Sport and Physical Activity and Recreation Council (I·SPARC) handed out the awards to a total of 36 athletes in six regions — Fraser, Interior, Northeast, Northwest, Vancouver Coastal and Vancouver Island.</p>
      <p>“Congratulations to each of the 36 talented athletes selected as regional award recipients this year,” Lisa Beare, minister of tourism, arts and culture, said in a press release. “Your extraordinary achievements in sport and school and as community leaders are an inspiration to everyone in B.C. I wish you the very best as you continue to strive for greatness in athletics and beyond.”</p>
      <p>The Vancouver Coastal region winners include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Kieran McKay, 19, lacrosse, Michel Band (Vancouver)</li>
        <li>Madison Fowler, 17, softball, soccer, ultimate, Xaxli’p First Nation (New Westminster)</li>
        <li>Jaiden Terry, 16, lacrosse, Tsal’alh First Nation (Vancouver)</li>
        <li>Shana George, 16, soccer, Squamish Nation (West Vancouver)</li>

        <li>Kayla Munro, 17, hockey, softball, Métis (North Vancouver)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>“Our region has gathered to recognize six incredible youth leaders,” said Courtenay Gibson, Vancouver Coastal regional leader for I·SPARC. “Tonight, we honour not only their athletic achievements, but their character, spirit and leadership and look forward to their continued success and dedication to their communities and the sports they love.”</p>
      <p>The regional award recipients automatically serve as nominees for the provincial awards, which are selected in early 2020. Ten provincial recipients will be awarded at the Gathering Our Voices opening ceremony in Kamloops on March 16 and will go on display in at the B.C. Sports Hall of Fame.</p>
