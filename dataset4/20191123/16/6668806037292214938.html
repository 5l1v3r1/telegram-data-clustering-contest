      <p>Ayushmann Khurrana is on a roll. His last film Bala marked his seventh consecutive hit at the box-office. Now, that is a remarkable achievement for any actor in the industry. Ayushmann, through his films, has tried to shed light on various topics that are considered a taboo in our society. With Bala, we are given a glimpse of how our society is obsessed with physical appearance. While Ayushmann plays a prematurely balding man in the film, Bhumi Pednekar's character has to battle discrimination against darker skin.</p>
