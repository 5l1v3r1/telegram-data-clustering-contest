      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> campmates are in for a treat (well kind of) tonight as the two camps will reunite for the first time for a Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>The main camp and the jungle jailhouse camp will be coming together to take part in a rather gruesome-sounding trial – and they have to hold live bugs in their mouths for 60 seconds (rather them than us).</p>
      <p>The news was announced on Friday night’s Extra Camp as Adam Thomas interviewed I’m A Celeb crew member, Kate.</p>
      <p>One group of campmates will have to endure the ‘critter drop’ where they will have a selection of creepy crawlies poured all over them.</p>
      <p>The other group will have to take part in the ‘hold in mouth trial’.</p>
      <p>‘They are going to take a hold in mouth trial where they have to hold different critters in their mouth for 60 seconds,’ Kate explained.</p>

      <p>‘And there’s going to be lots of horrible ones like the Huntsman spider.</p>
      <p>‘The trial will end with them eating a cow’s anus and a cow’s eye.’</p>
      <p>Ahead of the show, it was reported that producers<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/im-a-celebrity-bosses-ban-live-insects-from-bushtucker-trials-after-animal-rights-backlash-11165998/"> banned the use of live insects on the programme.</a></p>

      <p>The show came under fire in 2017 when Vanessa White and Jennie McAlpine had to keep animals in their mouths while humming for a Bushtucker trial.</p>
      <p>An ITV spokesman said at the time: ‘As a production, I’m a Celebrity complies with all regional and national laws concerning the use of insects animals and reptiles.’</p>

      <p>A show source told BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat: ‘I’m A Celebrity producers have taken a look at the trials and decided that no live critters would be eaten in the trials this year.</p>
      <p>‘They have been planning this for some time and actually last year beach worms were the only critters eaten live but this time around they’ve decided to implement the change fully and permanently.’</p>

      <p>I’m A Celebrity has faced <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/11/22/its-time-to-ban-eating-live-creatures-on-im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-7080860/">criticism for its use of live animals and insects in Bushtucker Trials</a> throughout its 19-series history.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Wildlife experts and animal charities have repeatedly condemned producers for the ‘cruel’ and ‘abusive’ treatment of live creatures in tasks.</p>
      <p>BBC Autumn Watch presenter <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/chris-packham-says-im-a-celebrity-bug-eating-trials-are-just-as-bad-as-eating-a-live-baby-monkey-11166760/">Chris Packman</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/im-a-celebritys-bushtucker-trials-normalise-animal-cruelty-and-must-end-11073538/">animals rights activist Tayana Simons</a>, and vegan blogger Lucy Watson are also among those to have spoken out.</p>
      <p>Chris previously <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/29/chris-packham-calls-on-ant-and-dec-to-stop-animal-cruelty-on-im-a-celebrity-by-axing-bushtucker-trials-11002775/">called on I’m A Celebrity hosts Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly</a> to consider the use of insects in the show.</p>
