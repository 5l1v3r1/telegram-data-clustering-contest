      <h4>LeBron James let it all out when he loudly passed gas before getting into a car in front of fans in Oklahoma City, OK on the night of Nov. 21 and the unexpected move brought on a lot of laughter.</h4>
      <p><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/lebron-james/"><b>LeBron James</b></a>‘ quick appearance in an Oklahoma City parking lot proved that when he needs to pass a little gas, he doesn’t care who’s around! The 34-year-old <b>Los Angeles Lakers</b> player and an entourage, which included <b>Oklahoma City Thunder</b> player <b>Chris Paul</b>, 34, walked by a few fans while leaving Mohagany Prime Steakhouse on the night of Nov. 21 and although they didn’t stop to sign autographs as requested, LeBron left the onlookers with something a little more memorable. Just before the athlete, who was wearing gray sweatpants, got into the group’s vehicle, he lifted up his leg and let out a VERY loud fart that basically echoed across the lot. It led to many laughs from the fans and the guys that were with LeBron even complained that he was letting the smell into the car. Check out the video of LeBron’s wild moment <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/23/lebron-james-fart-video-pulitzer/">HERE</a>!</p>
      <p>Before his latest surprising appearance, LeBron was spotted hanging out with his wife <b>Savannah</b> in Sept. but there was definitely no public passing of gas there! The lovebirds showed off some PDA during the <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/09/09/lebron-savannah-james-italy-vacation-pda-photos/">rare outing in Portofino, Italy on Sept. 9</a>. They went shopping while walking hand-in-hand and looked more in love than ever as LeBron even showed off a big smile on his face at one point.</p>
      <p>When LeBron is not surprising fans with letting out gas in random places or hanging out on romantic strolls with his wife, he’s busy on the court with the Lakers. He joined the popular team in 2018 after playing for the <b>Cleveland Cavaliers</b> for four years and has been impressing people with his moves on and apparently off the court too!</p>
