      <h1>Arsenal earn last gasp draw at home to second bottom Southampton</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:41:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:41</time> by <a rel="author">ESPN</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/131752/Alexandre-Lacazette">Alexandre Lacazette</a> earned Arsenal a last-gasp 2-2 draw at home to second bottom Southampton on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Unai Emery came into this match under huge pressure following four successive Premier League matches without a win but the visit of a team who lost <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/report?gameId=541750">9-0 at home to Leicester</a> less than a month ago seemed like the perfect opportunity to end that run.</p>

      <p>However, Arsenal were behind after eight minutes when their defence was caught out by <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/91489/Ryan-Bertrand">Ryan Bertrand</a>'s quick free kick and <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/141706/Danny-Ings">Danny Ings</a> hit an effort in off the post.</p>

      <p>The visitors were by far the better team but Arsenal drew level with their first attack when Lacazette finished off on 18 minutes after <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/122260/Pierre-Emerick-Aubameyang">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a>'s initial shot had been blocked following good work from Mesut Ozil.</p>
      <p>But the hosts failed to build on their goal and Southampton had the chance to take the lead when <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/214794/Kieran-Tierney">Kieran Tierney</a> was adjudged to have pulled Ings' shirt and, following a consultation with the VAR, referee Stuart Attwell pointed to the spot.</p>
      <p><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/163111/James-Ward-Prowse">James Ward-Prowse</a> saw his initial effort saved by <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/153765/Bernd-Leno">Bernd Leno</a>, but put in the rebound. However, with Arsenal heading for a potentially season-defining defeat, Lacazette popped up to earn his side a point in the 96th minute.</p>
      <p>Despite the late goal, Arsenal's players left the pitch to a chorus of boos from the home supporters.</p>
