      <p>The trailer for the twelfth season of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/doctor-who/">Doctor Who</a> has just dropped – promising to take viewers through a whole new journey in time and space.</p>
      <p>It was an action-packed trailer, and of course there’s a lot more to unpack. From returning monsters you might recognise, to those you don’t and the hints that the legendary story arc has made a return after a brief absence in series 11.</p>
      <p>Join us now as we dissect the trailer and analyse all the little tidbits you may have missed on your few (hundred) watches.</p>
      <h4>‘The name’s Doctor… THE Doctor.’</h4>

      <p>If it wasn’t already great seeing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jodie-whittaker/">Jodie Whittaker</a> in a suit, fans got a lovely – and surprising! – homage to James Bond.</p>
      <p>Appearing in a (very fitting we must say) suit and bow tie, the Doctor introduced herself by way of 007’s most famous catchphrase.</p>

      <p>Does this mean we’re going to get a spy caper in a new episode? We sure hope so!</p>
      <h4>Was that… a Racnoss?</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DOCTOR-WHO-3-RACNOSS-8904.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C247&amp;ssl=1"/>
        <figcaption>Looks familiar to us (Picture: BBC)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>We got a few glimpses of several aliens that are going to be featured in the new set of episodes, but one caught our eye immediately.</p>
      <p>In a very close-up shot we get a good look at a fanged, spiky black alien that looks like it may cause trouble for the TARDIS team.</p>
      <p>For the long-standing Whovians amongst us, the creature looked remarkably similar to the Racnoss Empress, a giant red spider alien that battled the Doctor in The Runaway Bride Christmas special.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/PRI_99914085.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C303&amp;ssl=1"/>

      </figure>
      <p>We don’t see the full body of the alien, which is important since the Racnoss stand on massive eight arachnid legs, so it would have blown the reveal. A very left-field choice of Who alien to bring back, but we’re excited nonetheless!</p>
      <h4>Stephen Fry as the Prime Minister? Sir Lenny Henry carrying a gun?!</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DOCTOR-WHO-2-FRY-16a9.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C249&amp;ssl=1"/>
        <figcaption>PM Fry? (Picture: BBC)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/doctor-who-series-12-adds-lenny-henry-and-stephen-fry-as-guest-stars-and-it-almost-makes-up-for-no-christmas-special-11189758/">Stephen Fry and Sir Lenny Henry were recently announced to be joining the cast</a> of the long-running sci-fi show in guest stints, and it looks like one will be a help and the other a hindrance to The Doctor and her friends.</p>
      <p>In the trailer, Fry practically begs the Doctor to help the country out, which leads us to believe he is probably some kind of government official – if not the Prime Minister himself.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Oh, Sir Lenny! (Picture: BBC)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Sir Lenny Henry, however, cuts an entirely different figure, poking his head out of a car and brandishing a gun. His suit-and-tie attire leads us to believe he may pop up in the same 007-referencing episode, imagine him as a Bond villain!</p>

      <h4>The return of the Cybermen</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DOCTOR-WHO-5-CYBER-e22f.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C244&amp;ssl=1"/>
        <figcaption>They’re back! (Picture: BBC)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The Cybermen are one of The Doctor’s most iconic foes, although they haven’t yet been seen in Whittaker’s stint in the TARDIS.</p>
      <p>Humanoids from Earth’s ‘sister-planet’ who replaced their body parts with machinery, they’re on a mission to upgrade the entire universe, but haven’t been seen since they faced off with Peter Capaldi in his last series</p>
      <p>We only get the tiniest glimpses at the iconic tin men, but it’s safe to say the baddies look a bit aged and rusted but are slowly coming back to life…</p>
      <h4>The Judoon are back!</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DOCTOR-WHO-7-JUDDON-be1e.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C247&amp;ssl=1"/>
        <figcaption>Keep them away from any hospitals (Picture: BBC)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Mo! Fo! Clo! Do!</p>
      <p>The Judoon are one of the oddest creations from New Who – rhinoceros-headed space police who have met the Doctor on several journeys, first debuting in the first episode of the third series (where they teleported a hospital to the moon).</p>
      <p>We see them make their grand return in the new clip, but it’s never settled whether the Doctor will be helped by the Judoon… or if she’s turned into a fugitive.</p>
      <h4>‘Something is coming for me’</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DOCTOR-WHO-6-SOMETHING-COMING-8ac2.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C247&amp;ssl=1"/>
        <figcaption>Keep the Doctor safe! (Picture: BBC)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It’s only towards the end of the trailer that we get a sense that there’s a larger story brewing in the background of the twelfth season.</p>
      <p>We see the Doctor in some kind of control room (could it be in the TARDIS?) where she admits to her companions Yaz (Mandip Gill). Ryan (Tosin Cole) and Graham (Bradley Walsh) that ‘something is coming for me.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The only question is… what is it? Or who is it? Lord knows the Doctor has made her fair share of enemies over the years but this seems a lot more… personal somehow. The Doctor’s own people, the Time Lords, have a fracturous relationship with the favourite child of Gallifrey, and haven’t been seen since series 9, could they be making a reappearance?</p>
      <h4>All hail the return of the story arc!</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DOCTOR-WHO-7-ARC-677c.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C248&amp;ssl=1"/>
        <figcaption>The Doctor’s friend can save her from this threat… right? (Picture: BBC)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>With all this in mind, we think it’s pretty clear that the trailer is hinting at a bigger story emerging throughout series 12 and we couldn’t be more excited.</p>
      <p>One of the defining features of New Who (and why, we think, it became so popular) were it’s season-long story arcs that set the tone for each run and ended with The Doctor facing the Big Bad for each successive season in an epic finale. Think Bad Wolf in series 1, Torchwood in series 2 and Mr Saxon in series 3.</p>
      <p>As time went on, however, the arcs got longer and more complicated, you could practically count Matt Smith’s entire three-series run as one big storyline in itself, and as a reaction against fan confusion, new showrunner Chris Chibnall ensured that series 11 was far more episodic.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/PRI_99926003.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C303&amp;ssl=1"/>
        <figcaption>Bad Wolf is a great example of an effective Doctor Who story arc (Picture: BBC)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>But we can’t help but think the seeds for a bigger story were planted in Whittaker’s first series, too. We’re taking ourselves back to the second episode of that installment, where The Doctor reacts rather virulent to a mention of ‘the Timeless Child.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Who is this child, why is it timeless exactly and what does it mean for the Doctor? Something tells us we’re about to find out…</p>
