      <p><b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Pink_Lloyd">Pink Lloyd</a></b> successfully defended his title when he charged from last-to-first to win the Grade 2, $175,000 <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/race/2019_Kennedy_Road">Kennedy Road Stakes</a></b> at Woodbine on Saturday. <br/>It was the third straight win in the race for the 7-year-old gelding by Old Forester, who improved his overall record to 22 wins in 27 starts. <br/>Pink Lloyd was sent off the heavy 3-5 favorite in the field of eight. Ridden by jockey Eurico Da Silva, Pink Lloyd was a bit keen through the first furlong, and eventually was settled at the rear of the field as Richiesinthehouse led the field through the early stages of the race.<br/>As the field raced into the far turn, Pink Lloyd began to close in on the leaders, making a bold, sweeping move while racing wide. In the stretch it was all Pink Lloyd, as he took command and pulled away to win by just over a length.</p>

      <p>Extravagant Kid settled for second in a photo over Malibu Secret.<br/>Final time for the six furlong contest was 1:08.72.<br/>It was a bittersweet victory for Woodbine’s leading jockey, who will be retiring from racing at the conclusion of the meet.<br/>“I want to thank this horse for all the good feelings he gave me,” said an emotional Da Silva in the winner’s circle. “Yesterday was not easy for me and today was a tough time because I know it was my last time riding him. All I can say is I’ve never had so much great feelings from a horse like I did with him.<br/>“And you see today, there was so much [traffic] in front of me, I just took him back and I said, “Boy, we need to go outside.’ I went probably six-wide in the turn. You know, there’s only one horse that can do it, his name is Pink Lloyd.”</p>
