      <p>The filming for the show comes about after the TV star announced she gave birth back in August but kept the news a secret.</p>
      <p>The singer managed to keep us all in the dark as her last Instagram post before the announcement showed her wearing a sheer sparkly dress with her baby bump clearly visible.</p>
      <p>But she was spotted arriving for filming of AGT last Friday with her bump clearly missing, sparking rumours she had already given birth.</p>
      <p>Anaya is Alesha’s second child with her husband Azuka; the couple is already parents to five-year-old daughter Azura Sienna.</p>
