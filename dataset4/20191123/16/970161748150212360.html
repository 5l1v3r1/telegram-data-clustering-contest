      <p>Liam Hemsworth has been spotted doing his grocery shopping in Malibu following comments from his sister-in-law Elsa Pataky that he’s ‘doing well’ following his split from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/miley-cyrus/">Miley Cyrus</a>.</p>
      <p>The actor, 29, was seen doing the food shop in Whole Foods in Malibu, California, as he spent the week surfing with his brother, Chris Hemsworth.</p>
      <p>He looked lost in thought as he stocked up on some essentials, in his rare time off from his busy work schedule.</p>
      <p>It comes after Chris’s wife,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/liam-hemsworths-sister-law-elsa-pataky-says-star-deserves-split-miley-cyrus-11199308/"> Elsa, spoke out about how Liam is doing following the split from his wife, Miley Cyrus</a>, in August.</p>
      <p>She said at a press conference in Madrid this week: ‘My brother-in-law, well… after a relationship that you’ve dedicated ten years to, he’s a little bit down, but he’s coping well.</p>
      <p>‘He’s a strong boy and he deserves the best. I think he deserves much better.’</p>

      <p>She explained: ‘You always find support in your family, and he’s joined at the hip with [Chris], who has been there to give all the strength he needed.’</p>
      <p>Elsa’s comments surprised fans after she and Miley had seemed close while the couple were together, even getting matching tattoos as a tribute to their friendship three years ago.</p>

      <p>Liam and Miley confirmed their split after eight months of marriage – following 10 years of an on-off relationship – over the summer.</p>
      <p>Miley was soon spotted kissing Kaitlynn Carter on a boat while on holiday, but that short-lived rebound romance lasted just six weeks.</p>
      <p>She then got together with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/miley-cyrus-cody-simpson-split-month-hot-heavy-dating-11179089/">Cody Simpson, with the pair being rumoured to have split last week</a>, but have since claimed they are together but have an ‘easy’ relationship where they can spend extended time apart.</p>
