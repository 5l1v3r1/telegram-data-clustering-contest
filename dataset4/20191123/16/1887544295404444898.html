      <p>GUELPH, Ont. - Police say safe-cracking gear and soy sauce were just some of the tools a Guelph, Ont. man used while allegedly vandalizing a local business in September.</p>
      <p>They say the vandalism took place on Sept. 18 after the business closed for the day.</p>
      <p>Investigators allege the man hid inside a bathroom until staff went home, then emerged with a bag of break-and-enter tools which he used to open a safe containing more than $2,000.</p>
      <p>They allege he then proceeded to cause roughly $100,000 worth of damage to the business, partially by pouring soy sauce over multiple electronics.</p>
      <p>They say he also damaged ceiling tiles, walls and venting.</p>
      <p>Police say some of the man's actions were captured on surveillance video and he is now facing multiple, unspecified charges.</p>
