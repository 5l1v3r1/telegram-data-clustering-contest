      <p>KwaZulu-Natal is fast becoming the tornado capital of South Africa, after the second tornado of the weekend was reported in Ulundi on Saturday.</p>

      <p>The report comes just hours after SAWS issued a severe storm alert for those near Ulundi.</p>
      <p>“Please note that this storm could lead to damaging winds and large hail. It is moving south-east. Warning has been issued,” it <a href="https://twitter.com/SAWeatherServic/status/1198235392501338112">tweeted around 4pm SAST</a>.</p>
      <h3>Four tornados in less than two weeks</h3>
      <p>A tornado is defined by SAWS as a “rotating column of air extending from the cloud base of a cumuliform cloud and is in contact with the ground”.</p>
      <p>These vortices can result in extensive damages and loss of life,” SAWS warned in <a href="https://twitter.com/SAWeatherServic/status/1198159745967968256">an earlier statement</a>.</p>
      <p>This is the fourth such report of a tornado in KwaZulu-Natal since the month began.</p>
      <p>On 13 November, tornadoes near Bergville and New Hanover were reported.</p>
      <p><a href="http://memeburn.com/2019/11/utrecht-tornado-pictures/">Earlier on Saturday</a>, SAWS also confirmed that another had occurred close to Utrecht near Newcastle on Friday night.</p>
      <p>A number of weather warnings and watches have been issued by SAWS on Saturday, covering a vast swathe of KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, southern Limpopo and Gauteng.</p>
      <h3>Follow the South African Weather Service</h3>
      <p>Weather is fickle and subject to change, so we’d recommend following SAWS on its <a href="https://twitter.com/SAWeatherServic">official Twitter account</a>, especially for severe thunderstorm updates.</p>
      <p>And be sure to bookmark its <a href="http://www.weathersa.co.za/home/warnings">warnings portal</a> too, where it regularly updates the advisories and more serious information on the daily.</p>
