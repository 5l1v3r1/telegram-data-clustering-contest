      <p>Former Millwall boss Harris made a quick return to south-east London after replacing <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/neil-warnock/"><b>Neil Warnock</b></a> during the international break and might well have been questioning his choice as first half goals from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/conor-gallagher/"><b>Conor Gallagher</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jonathan-leko/"><b>Jonathan Leko</b></a> left Cardiff in trouble at the break.</p>
      <p>His mood was hardly improved by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/junior-hoilett/"><b>Junior Hoilett</b></a>'s poor early second half penalty, which was easily saved by Addicks keeper <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dillon-phillips/"><b>Dillon Phillips</b></a>.</p>
      <p>But Harris' afternoon quickly took a turn for the better when <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nathaniel-mendez-laing/"><b>Nathaniel Mendez-Laing</b></a> reduced the deficit in the 52nd minute before substitute Lee Tomlin grabbed a 73rd-minute leveller.</p>
      <p>The newly-appointed Cardiff manager said: "Coming from behind it was a point gained definitely.</p>
      <p>"I think it became a bit like a basketball match in the second half, which isn't really how I want to coach and manage.</p>
      <p>"At half-time the group was a little bit deflated. I think we felt a little bit sorry for ourselves because we certainly didn't deserve to be 2-0 down."</p>
      <p>Asked what impressed him most about the second-half recovery, Harris replied: "The character.</p>
      <p>"It was a tough week last week for the players in the sense of losing the manager and a guy who is hugely respected within the club, to try and take on my ideas, the environment I want to create and the discipline I want in the group.</p>
      <p>"To be 2-0 down is a bit of a kick in the proverbials to be fair and you hope for a reaction at half-time.</p>
      <p>"I asked for a reaction, I got it and I've seen the group want to be successful, they want to learn."</p>
      <p>Addicks manager Lee Bowyer was without the services of 10 senior players and was not even able to name a full contingent of substitutes.</p>
      <p>Despite his obvious frustration at blowing their interval advantage, the Valley chief could not fault the way his injury-plagued side had put Cardiff on the back foot.</p>
      <p>Bowyer explained: "To be two up at half-time and end up coming away with a point is disappointing</p>
      <p>"But on the positive side we've played against Cardiff, a team who were in the Premier League this time last year, and I felt that we were better than them for large parts of the game.</p>
      <p>"Once we scored then I felt like we controlled the game for the rest of the first half.</p>
      <p>"We were so much better than them in the first half they even had to change their shape and match us up. Obviously we were causing them a lot of problems.</p>
      <p>"In the second half again I thought we were good. It was a bit more end-to-end. They had chances, we had chances.</p>
      <p>"I thought the penalty was soft because the two players were pulling each other. Thankfully Dillon saved it but the least we deserved today was a point."</p>
