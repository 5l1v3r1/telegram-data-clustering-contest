      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Saturday is the Wisconsin Badgers' last home game of the season, and the team's <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/wisconsin-still-has-a-chance-to-make-the-big-ten-championship-game/1142926274">championship chances</a> depend on a win against Purdue.</p>
      <p>To catch the final home game matchup, tune in to FOX at 3 p.m. for kickoff against the Boilermakers.</p>
      <p>Of course, if watching the game from the comfort of your home isn't what you're looking for, there are countless restaurants and bars that will be playing today's game -- a trip down to State Street is sure to be a lively option.</p>
      <p>If you're looking for some in-person excitement without the hassle of going to the game, head down to the streets and parking lots around Camp Randall for some family-friendly tailgates or Badger Bash at Union South.</p>
      <p>If the Badgers beat Purdue on Saturday and defeat Minnesota when they visit them on the road Nov. 30, then Wisconsin will take the Big Ten West title.</p>
