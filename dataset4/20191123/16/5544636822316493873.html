      <p>Aide-de-camp to Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu during the civil war and head of Rock Family Church, Bishop Obi Udezue Onubogu has identified “dialogue” as the best possible means for Ndigbo to produce president in 2023.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.concisenews.global/">Concise News</a> reports that in a recent interview with Sun News Online, Onubogu stressed that “Ndigbo cannot do it alone”.</p>
      <p>“These revolve around dialogue also,” the cleric explained.</p>
      <p>“Both restructuring and the possibility of having Nigerian President of Igbo extraction in 2023 can only be achieved through dialogue.</p>
      <p>“Ndigbo cannot do it alone. The people that think it is their turn should also come to the table as Ndigbo and present their case.</p>
      <p>“We should try to win one another by explaining the importance of having our own to be in charge of the affairs of the country.</p>
      <p>“In short, I am so deep into it that every situation that has happened in the country, I see the need to talk to the people concerned.</p>
      <p>“If you don’t like the word dialogue, let me reduce it to discussing with the people; discussing with people who might even oppose your views, those that agree with you and those that may have a different idea about the pressure that we are all facing.”</p>
      <p>Furthermore, asked to offer advice to South East governors on how to bring the Igbo together, Onubogu posited: “These men are doing their best. They are faced with very difficult work conditions. The church should be in prayers at every moment.</p>
      <p>“We should lift them up in prayer and support the various good projects they have. What we have is that those who are in every good position are under serious attack and criticism and so on.</p>
      <p>“But we elected them into that position so we should assist them to make their mark. That doesn’t mean that when they do wrong we will not speak out against it but if they do things that are against our interests and welfare, we should speak out against it.</p>
      <p>“We elected them into that position but we should be very careful not to take the position of opposition from the beginning.</p>
      <p>“You want to oppose their views, you want to oppose the projects they have, you want to oppose their suggestions, no, that’s not how to do it.</p>
      <p>“As long as they do not take the views of the people for granted or ignore the views of the people, we should come around and make suggestions and appreciate them when they do good.”</p>
