      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:21:59+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/joe-rimmer/" target="_blank">Joe Rimmer</a></address>
      <p>Fabinho will miss Liverpool's match with Brighton next weekend after picking up his fifth booking of the season.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian midfielder was shown a yellow card for a late challenge on Crystal Palace's Cheick Kouyate, with Liverpool <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/crystal-palace-vs-liverpool-live-17294134">leading 1-0 through Sadio Mane's second half goa</a> l.</p>
      <p>Fabinho was left out of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/liverpool-verdict-martin-atkinson-var-17191264">Liverpool's win over Aston Villa</a> in early November, with Jurgen Klopp keen to ensure he didn't miss the Reds' meeting with <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/liverpool-verdict-jurgen-klopps-man-17207583">Premier League title rivals Man City</a> .</p>
      <p>It proved to be the right move from the Reds boss as Fabinho scored the opening goal in a <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/liverpool-verdict-jurgen-klopps-man-17207583">3-1 victory at Anfield</a> .</p>
      <p>Liverpool face Brighton at Anfield next week after the trip to Palace, but the midfielder will be available once again for the Merseyside derby on December 4.</p>
