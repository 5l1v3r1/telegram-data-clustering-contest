      <p>No fewer than sixty-two personnel of the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) have been dismissed in 2019, over corruption allegations.</p>
      <p>This was disclosed by the FRSC corps marshal, Boboye Oyeyemi, while speaking with newsmen in Abuja on Friday, November 22.</p>
      <p>Oyeyemi said: “These consist of 14 officers and 48 marshals with several others receiving various degrees of punishment in accordance with the provisions of the FRSC regulations on discipline.”</p>
      <p>Oyeyemi also added that the investigation of 172 officials was currently underway following collaboration with the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) and the State Security Service (SSS).</p>
      <p>Speaking on efforts to curb corruption among its officials, the corps marshal said: “I wish to use this opportunity to urge members of the public not to hesitate to report any wrongdoing by the FRSC personnel for proper disciplinary actions, as the corps will not condone bribery and corruption from any of its personnel,”</p>
