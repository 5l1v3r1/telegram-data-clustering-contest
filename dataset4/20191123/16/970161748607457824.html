      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/steph-mcgovern/">Steph McGovern</a> and her partner recently welcomed their newborn daughter into the world – and it looks like she’s being spoiled rotten with all the baby gifts.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter, the proud mum shared a snap of the tot’s presents from a number of family members and friends – and it’s too cute.</p>
      <p>Perfectly displayed for the snap, the presenter showed off a collection of custom made baby grows and bibs – with the likes of ‘my mam’s the business’ printed across the front of one, while another reads: ‘<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bbc-breakfast/">BBC Breakfast</a> baby correspondent’.</p>
      <p>Writing alongside the picture, the 37-year-old said: ‘My mates + family have really excelled on the slogans/branding for my baby daughter’s clothes.</p>
      <p>‘Here are some of my faves: @BBCBreakfast @Boro #perfectpresents  #luckylittlelady.’</p>
