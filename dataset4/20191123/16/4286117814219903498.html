      <p>The political events of Saturday that led to the BJP making a comeback to power in Maharashtra with the help of Ajit Pawar, and his as-yet unspecified number of MLAs, also led to a missing person complaint being filed for an MLA from the Sharad Pawar-led party.</p>
      <p>Shahapur NCP MLA Daulat Daroda went 'missing' after reaching Raj Bhavan in south Mumbai the morning where Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar took oath as chief minister and deputy CM, respectively.</p>
      <p>Daroda had left his constituency, in neighbouring Thane, along with his son Karan on Friday night and has since been unreachable after reaching Mumbai, said an official.</p>
      <p>Former MLA Pandurang Barora approached Shahapur police station and filed a missing complaint about Daroda, he added.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Daroda's son Karan told reporters in Mumbai later that his father was not in touch even with him since the Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>Karan also asked his father to stand by the side of NCP supremo Sharad Pawar.</p>
