      <h2>Coastguard rescue teams and a rescue helicopter were called to the scene but the casualties managed to get ashore</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:43:14+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:43</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Collings</a></address>
      <p>The RNLI had to be called out after two people and a dog got cut off by the high tide in Northumberland.</p>
      <p>Just before 11am on Saturday, the coastguard were alerted to the situation at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland">Budle Bay</a> , north of Seahouses.</p>
      <p>The RNLI inshore lifeboat was taken by road to be launched at Budle Bay as it couldn't launch at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/seahouses">Seahouses</a> due to the rough sea conditions and strong wind.</p>
      <p>Local coastguard rescue teams had also been deployed to the scene and due to the sea conditions, a rescue helicopter was also requested as back up.</p>
      <p>However, as it would take up to 40 minutes to arrive from Prestwick in Scotland, the Seahouses Lifeboat Operations Manager directed the launch of the larger all weather lifeboat, to support the small inshore lifeboat. The inshore lifeboat was launched despite the rough water in the bay.</p>
      <p>The coastguard then paged the crews to tell them that the casualties had actually managed to get themselves ashore safely near Ross Links, on the north side of the bay. All rescue resources were then stood down.</p>
      <p>Seahouses Lifeboat Operations Manager commented:Â "We have had a number of calls this year to Budle Bay for persons being cut off by the tide.</p>
      <p>"We would urge people to take great care when walking across sandy bay areas like Budle Bay and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/holy-island">Holy Island</a> , to be aware of how quickly the tide comes in, encircling the unwary.</p>
      <p>"While not wanting to discourage walkers from enjoying the coastline, they do need to be aware of the speed of the rising tide. On this occasion, it was later ascertained that the people involved were not in immediate danger. It was possibly more of a false alarm with good intent."</p>
