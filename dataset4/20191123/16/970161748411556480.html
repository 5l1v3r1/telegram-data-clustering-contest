      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> has apologised to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> supporters after he refused to approach the away section after his side’s victory over <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/west-ham-united-fc/">West Ham</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Mourinho got off to a winning start having replaced <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> earlier this week as Spurs sealed a 3-2 victory against Manuel Pellegrini’s men at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>Son Heung-Min and Lucas Moura had put Spurs two goals ahead in the first half before Harry Kane added a third in the 49th minute.</p>
      <p>West Ham scored twice through Michail Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna but left it too late to find an equaliser.</p>
      <p>After the match, Spurs’ players went over to their travelling supporters but Mourinho opted to hang back and applaud fans from afar.</p>

      <p>‘At the end of the game I didn’t want to go to our fans because I felt I shouldn’t,’ Mourinho explained to Spurs TV.</p>

      <p>‘It’s about the players, not about me.</p>
      <p>‘Apologies for that, I stayed away.</p>
      <p>‘But I appreciate the few thousand who were there behind the team and I think really enjoying and understanding the difficulties and supporting, and probably now as happy as we are.’</p>
      <p>Mourinho also revealed that Spurs second goal was a direct result of working on Lucas Moura’s positioning in training earlier this week.</p>
      <p>‘It’s not just passion,’ said Mourinho.</p>
      <p>‘We did something that we did in training, Lucas arrived in a position as a sequence of a dynamic that we did in training.</p>
      <p>And for a coach, for my staff, we thought about it, we trained it and when it happens it’s the best feeling a coach can have.’</p>
