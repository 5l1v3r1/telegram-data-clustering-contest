        <b>Alexandre Lacazette scored two, including an equaliser at the death, to salvage a point for Arsenal against Southampton.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Danny Ings put Southampton up after just eight minutes but Alexandra Lacazette eased the pressure on his boss 10 minutes later when he equalised.</p>
      <p>Arsenal came out stronger in the second, hitting the bar through substitute Nicolas Pepe before Southampton almost retook the lead through Cedric.</p>
      <p>They then did just that with 20 minutes left as James Ward-Prowse saw his penalty saved but scored his rebound.</p>
      <p>The hosts pushed forward in search of an equaliser, bringing on Martinelli and Willock, and the latter headed a ball straight at the keeper before blocking a shot on the line to keep Arsenal alive.</p>
      <p>It proved to be crucial as Lazazette scored his second of the day to salvage a point for Arsenal at the death in front of a displeased crowd.</p>
      <p>Southampton had a great early chance as Stuart Armstrong robbed former Celtic team-mate Kieran Tierney of possession with a little over 30 seconds gone but he could only shot wide.</p>
      <p>The lead would belong to the visitors nine minutes later as they caught the Arsenal defence napping.</p>
      <p>Nathan Redmond was fouled by Calum Chambers and the recalled Ryan Bertrand played a quick free-kick into Ings, who ran in on Leno’s goal and converted the opener off the inside of the post.</p>
      <p>Lacazette would equalise as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s shot was blocked into the path of his strike partner, who made no mistake in turning home his first goal since September 1.</p>
      <p>The rest of the half was a scrappy affair, Southampton already happy to start running down the clock while Arsenal still proved wasteful in possession as a smattering of jeers from the home fans greeted the half-time whistle.</p>
      <p>Emery responded by reverting to a back four and introducing club-record signing Nicolas Pepe in place of Chambers.</p>
      <p>Saints goalkeeper Alex McCarthy was called into action soon after the restart to keep out Aubameyang after the ball had broken fortuitously into the path of the Arsenal skipper.</p>
      <p>Pepe then summed up his start to life in England as he was slipped through behind the Southampton defence and ran in one-on-one against McCarthy before attempting to square to a team-mate instead of take on the strike.</p>
      <p>The Ivory Coast forward did well to make contact with Tierney’s cross but his scissor kick came back off the woodwork.</p>
      <p>Emery’s side started to control proceedings but were lucky not to fall behind a second time as Sokratis Papastathopoulos dallied and lost the ball to Cedric Soares inside his own penalty area.</p>
      <p>The Portugal full-back’s cross evaded Michael Obafemi, the young forward six yards out from an open goal but unable to make contact.</p>
      <p>Another error would see Southampton take the lead with 20 minutes remaining as Tierney pulled back on Ings following a ball back into the box, with referee Stuart Atwell pointing to the spot.</p>
      <p>Ward-Prowse stepped up but saw his low penalty kept out by Leno, only to tuck away the rebound and celebrate in front of the travelling support.</p>
      <p>Emery turned to youngsters Gabriel Martinelli and Joe Willock and it was the latter who had a header well-saved by McCarthy.</p>
      <p>The England Under-21 international was then heavily involved at the other end as he raced back to clear Moussa Djenepo’s goalbound shot off the line.</p>
      <p>A number of stoppages led to seven minutes of injury-time as Djenpo spurned a fine chance to seal the points and it proved to be costly as Lacazette thrashed home at the back-post to salvage a point which does little for Emery’s current standing.</p>
