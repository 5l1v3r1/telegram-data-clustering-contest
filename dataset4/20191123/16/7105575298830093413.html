      <p>Have you ever experienced that awkward moment when you say something snarky behind someone's back and then realize later that they totally know you said it? Now, can you imagine how amplified that embarrassment would be if the targets of said snark were members of the royal family and they called you out on your comments during a visit to <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a29888580/kate-william-inside-kensington-palace/">Kensington Palace</a>?</p>
      <p>That's exactly what British radio host Greg James went through recently when he met with <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a29787972/meghan-markle-prince-harry-christmas-2019/">Prince William and Kate Middleton</a>.</p>
      <p>James, who hosts BBC 1’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0080x5m"><i>Breakfast with Greg James</i></a>, recently visited Kensington Palace with Radio 1’s Teen Heroes. During the visit, <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a29281032/prince-william-kate-middleton-boaty-mcboatface/">Will and Kate</a> low-key called him out on some comments he made on the air about their daughter, <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/g20121826/princess-charlotte-photos-through-the-years/">Princess Charlotte</a>.</p>
      <p>The incident in question went down when James <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a29660824/princess-charlotte-confident-loves-attention/">teased Charlotte</a> on air for shaking hands with the headmistress of her school on the first day of the new school year.</p>

      <p>"They were listening on the morning Charlotte went to school,” <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/radio-1s-greg-james-told-20917937">James told <i>The Mirror</i></a> of his awkward encounter with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. According to James, he "saw the photo during the show and said, ‘Who the hell shakes hands with their teacher on the first day?'"</p>
      <p>So what did <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a28312436/prince-william-begged-kate-middleton-to-take-him-back/">Will and Kate</a> have to say about the less-than-nice comments? James didn't say exactly, but he <i>did</i> reveal that the royal couple confronted him about it at the Kensington Palace meet and greet.</p>
      <p>"They said: 'We were listening on the morning of little <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a28911335/prince-george-princess-charlotte-school-photos-2019/">Charlotte’s first day</a>, and we want to talk to you about the handshaking thing.' I went: ‘Oh God, no!'" the radio host explained "They’d heard me saying, ‘this school was so posh they had to shake hands with their teacher every day. They were not like that in my day. You were pleased if you got a smile.'"</p>
      <p>Even though the host declined to share the specifics of what Will and Kate said about his Charlotte commentary, he did confirm that he and the royals are all good now.</p>
      <p>"I’m sure it’s all absolutely fine," he insisted.</p>
      <p>Phew.</p>
