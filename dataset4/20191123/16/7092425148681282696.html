        <b>Chelsea remain in the hunt for Premier League and Champions League glory - and former Blue Shaun Wright-Phillips is tipping them for big things this season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chelsea have been backed to eclipse Liverpool in the race for the Premier League title, as well as being given a chance of winning the Champions League by former player Shaun Wright-Phillips.</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard’s young guns have been firing on all cylinders recently, and sit above this evening’s opponents Manchester City in the table.</p>
      <p>The Blues look set for a comfortable top four finish, and are expected to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League.</p>
      <p>But ex-England winger and Stamford Bridge favourite Wright-Phillips has challenged his old side to push the boundaries even further this term.</p>
      <p>When asked what he considered would be a successful season for Chelsea, Wright-Phillips told Sportingbet: “With the way that Chelsea have started the season, the sky is the limit.</p>
      <p>“I do believe that if they can have a strong festive period, there is no reason that they can’t catch up with Liverpool – it is still a long season ahead.</p>
      <p>“Saying that, even if they end up finishing in the top four this season, that would still be exceptional.</p>
      <p>“With the new manager coming in and the transfer ban, that would be more than most people would have expected at the start of the season.”</p>
      <p>Wright-Phillips doesn’t necessarily think the Blues will be limited to domestic success either, giving them an outside chance for Champions League success if things go their way.</p>
      <p>“Chelsea have the quality to win the Champions League this season,” he continued.</p>
      <p>“If they get the luck of the draw, they could be in with an outside chance of progressing far in the competition.”</p>
      <p>Man City vs Chelsea gets underway from 5:30pm at the Etihad this evening.</p>
