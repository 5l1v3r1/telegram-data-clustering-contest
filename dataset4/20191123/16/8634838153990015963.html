        <b>Deported lawyer Miguna Miguna is set to return to the country if he's successful in filing a court case through Senior counsel John Khaminwa on November 27, 2019.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a Twitter post on November 23, 2019, Miguna made clear his ambitions to be back in the country once his travel documents are returned to him.</p>
      <p>“On November 27, 2019, at 9am, John Mugalasinga Khaminwa will appear before Justice Korir to seek orders compelling President Kenyatta and his subordinates to obey court orders. Return my valid Kenyan passport and allow me entry into the country. Thank you, Khaminwa,” read Miguna’s post.</p>

      <p>The firebrand lawyer and former aide of ODM leader Raila Odinga was deported on February 6, 2018, 7 days after administering the oath of the people's president to the former PM. </p>
      <p>The government held that Miguna violated provisions of Section 33 (1) and 43 (1) of the Kenya Citizenship and Immigration Act, 2011, therefore prompting his deportation to Canada where he is a citizen too.</p>
      <p>Interior Ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka claimed Miguna lost citizenship when he acquired a Canadian passport in 1988, after his application for a Kenyan one was denied on September 12, 1987.</p>
      <p>After an attempted return to the country on March 29, 2019, Miguna was deported for a second time in a dramatic show of might by the government. </p>
      <p>In February 2019, Miguna took to twitter to announce his comeback, something that never came to be.</p>
      <p>“Pursuant to rights vested upon me by God, my mother, the Constitution of Kenya, 2010, all applicable laws and orders issued by Justices Mwita, Kimaru, Odunga, Aburili, and Wakiaga, I hereby announce that I will return in April 2019 on a date to be announced,” Miguna had informed. </p>

      <p>On December 14, 2018, High Court Justice Enoch Chacha Mwita, sitting in a Nairobi court awarded Miguna a compensation of Ksh7million.</p>
      <p>Justice Mwita ruled that Miguna's deportation was unlawful and in violation of the constitution, terming the cancellation of his passport and the declaration that he was a prohibited immigrant as unconstitutional.</p>
      <p>On November 8, 2019, Chief Magistrate Stephen Mbungi ruled that the oath taken by the Raila and administered by Miguna after the disputed 2017 presidential election was not unlawful and that he would have only been held responsible if he used his swearing-in to commit a crime.</p>
