      <p>Kylie Jenner’s daughter, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/stormi-webster/">Stormi Webster</a>, continues to take fashion inspiration from her famous parents – and most notably her father, Travis Scott.</p>
      <p>The makeup mogul took to Instagram to share an adorable picture of Stormi wearing a colourful tie-dye t-shirt with matching Converse shoes, with her hair up in braids – seemingly channelling her rapper father.</p>
      <p>‘Coolest girl I know,’ Kylie captioned the post, while adding a heart emoji.</p>
      <p>Big sis <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> replied in the comments: ‘Obsessed w her hair [sic].’</p>
      <p>‘The cutest too,’ Khloe Kardashian added.</p>
      <p>And fans also took to the comments to shower the one-year-old with praise.</p>
      <p>‘The cutest baby I ever saw,’ one fan wrote.</p>
      <p>‘She knows how to dress,’ another added, complimenting her fashion sense.</p>

      <p>This also isn’t the first time that Stormi wore her hair up in braids inspired by her father – with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/kylie-jenners-daughter-stormi-rocks-braids-just-like-dad-travis-scott-hearts-melted-11173815/">Travis sharing another snap of her donning the same hairstyle</a> just a few days prior on his own Instagram.</p>

      <p>She also made reference to the rapper’s number one album ASTROWORLD, as she could also be seen wearing a necklace which said ‘Stormi’s World’.</p>
      <p>Kylie and Travis have mastered co-parenting pretty well since they split back in October, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/kylie-jenner-attends-ex-beau-travis-scotts-astroworld-festival-amid-drake-dating-rumours-11075016/">Kylie even attending the rapper’s Astroworld Festival earlier this month.</a></p>
      <p>‘Kylie flew to Houston with a group of friends. She returns to LA this morning,’ a source shared to <a href="https://people.com/tv/kylie-jenner-attends-travis-scott-astroworld-festival/">People.</a></p>
      <p>‘It was important for her to support Travis’s festival. They are still very close and often hang out with Stormi.’</p>
      <p>During the festival, the 27-year-old also took to the stage and referred to Kylie as his ‘wife’, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-back-together-rapper-calls-reality-star-beautiful-wife-floral-tribute-11086949/">sparking rumours of a reconciliation between the two.</a></p>
      <p>Travis was also gifted a set of flowers ahead of his performance at the festival, which were apparently sent by Kylie, and this could prove to be a hint that the two may be back on.</p>
