      <p>Infrastructure Minister Kevin Lewis has signed a ministerial decision to approve improvements to Route Orange in St Brelade.</p>
      <p>The decision follows a public consultation last year in which three-quarters of nearby residents said the area needed to be made safer for pedestrians. Following a second consultation, the preferred option has now been approved by the minister.</p>
      <p>The road between La Moye School and Les Creux Country Park will see a range of measures including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Changing the part-time 20mph limit to a permanent 20mph zone.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Improving gateway features on entering and exiting the area to highlight it as one where pedestrians can be expected.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Two raised-table zebra crossings at La Moye School and Les Creux.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The creation of a virtual footpath (a footpath flush with the road with a different coloured surface and bollard protection) from La Moye Garage to Le Clos Orange.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Pavement widening at La Moye School and close to the entrance of Les Creux.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Removal of a bus lay-by to accommodate the crossing close to Les Creux.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Deputy Lewis said: ‘After a thorough review of the area by specialists, as part of the Safer Routes to School scheme, these works will improve the safety of the area, which is used by students and residents. The improvements align with the Council of Ministers’ strategic priorities, including putting children first, improving Islanders’ wellbeing and protecting the environment.’</p>
