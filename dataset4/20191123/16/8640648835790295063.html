      <h1>More rain and snow in the forecast for Thanksgiving</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:59:59+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/staff/julie-wootton-greener/" target="_blank">Julie Wootton-Greener</a></address>
      <p>More precipitation is in the forecast, and that could impact Thanksgiving holiday travelers next week.</p>
      <p>Rain for the Las Vegas Valley and snow for Mt. Charleston is likely from Wednesday through Friday, according to the National Weather Service.</p>
      <p>Caleb Steele, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said there’s concern about Thanksgiving travel because of heavy rain in the forecast and snow that could impact mountain passes.</p>
      <p>“That’s what we’re watching now,” he said, but added there aren’t a lot of details yet.</p>
      <p>A chance of rain and snow starts Wednesday morning, and it’s most likely on Thursday and Friday, Steele said.</p>
      <p>Next week’s storm system has the potential to produce “probably quite a bit” of rain and snow — as much or more than the storm that hit earlier this week, he said.</p>
      <p>Mt. Charleston could get “feet of snow” during next week’s storm, he said, and snow could impact lower elevations, too — even Red Rock Canyon.</p>
      <p>For this weekend, Saturday and Sunday’s high temperature is expected at 62 degrees. Temperatures are forecast to drop slightly Tuesday, with an expected high of 56.</p>
