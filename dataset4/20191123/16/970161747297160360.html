      <p>If you’ve been on Twitter or <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tiktok/">TikTok</a> recently, you’ve probably been puzzled by some people doing a magical hand trick.</p>
      <p>19-year-old Tori Pareno has just gone viral for her mind-boggling hand swap illusion.</p>
      <p>In a video with 6 million views on Twitter, it appears as if the Filipino teen is pushing her fingers through her hands. How the heck does she do it?!</p>
      <p>Her Twitter followers have rapidly climbed since sharing the trick on Thursday, with the teen saying: ‘y’all have hand fetishes if 1 million of you watched this.’ And perhaps this is true.</p>

      <p>A variation of the challenge first surfaced in August 2018 when <a href="https://twitter.com/kay_dera/status/1032095025608515584">Twitter user @kay_dera posted a video</a> of her performing a similar hand movement. It was viewed 3.5 million times, and gained a bit of traction across social media as ‘the hand swap challenge’.</p>

      <p>This new incarnation has come about because of TikTok, where Tori also shared it <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@toripareno">with her 32,000 followers</a>.</p>
      <p>People are referring to the trick as ‘sorcery’ and ‘witchcraft’. Some users have pointed out that ‘You need mad skinny hands to be able to do this’, which, in a way, certainly helps.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, many TikTok users have shared videos of themselves giving the trick a go. And one Twitter user delivers his own rendition using hypnotising LED gloves:</p>

        <li>Put your right hand in front of you, palm facing forward, and place your left hand behind it</li>
        <li>Close the fingers of your left hand over the back of your right, poking your left fingers through your right fingers</li>
        <li>Let go of the front hand, and straighten the back hand while the front hand forms a fist. Repeat.</li>
        <li>Practice doing these movements quickly. Speed is key to making it look trippy.</li>
        <li>Look utterly impressed with your mad skillz.</li>
      </ol>
