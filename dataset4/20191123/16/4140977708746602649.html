                <h3>Team News</h3>
                <p>Both Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay will miss this match due to injuries and with Nemanja Matic having just returned from an injury, it is likely that 18-year old James Garner could be given his full Premier league debut.</p>

                      <p>Fred will likely partner the teenager in the middle while Andreas Pereira plays in between Marcus Rashford and Daniel James, who will operate from the left and right wings respectively. Anthony Martial will continue his role as their front man.</p>
                      <p>United’s backline will probably consist of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire. With Luke Shaw lacking match fitness, there is a chance that Ashley Young could take the left back spot from Brandon Williams. However, the youngster’s performance in their last match could help him edge out his captain.</p>

                          <p>Sheffield United do not have any injury concerns bar John Egan for the clash vs Manchester United. However, they will be without sensational keeper Dean Henderson, who is on loan at the club from Manchester United. The terms of his loan do not allow the 22-year old to play against his parent side, therefore Simon Moore will be handed his Premier League debut on Sunday.</p>
