      <h1>Last family to escape Bronx inferno that killed 13 speaks out</h1>

      <p>Kadian Blake counts her blessings every day now, not just at Thanksgiving — especially the one on her lap.</p>
      <p>Blake named her pretty 18-month-old daughter, Karen Kylie, after two of the five loved ones she lost in a <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/12/31/the-terrifying-first-moments-of-the-deadly-bronx-fire/">Christmastime fire</a> in the Bronx two years ago, the city’s deadliest in nearly three decades. In all, the blaze took 13 lives.</p>
      <p>Blake, her husband and their young son barely managed to escape the inferno. Family members who didn’t included her daughter’s namesakes, aunt Karen Stewart-Francis, 37, and her aunt’s 2-year-old daughter, Kylie. Also killed were uncle Holt Francis, 27; her aunt’s 7-year-old daughter, Kelesha; and Blake’s niece, Shawntay Young, 19.</p>
      <p>“I’m grateful that I had the time that I had with them,” said Blake, 34. “They knew they were loved. I told each and every one of them that I love them.”</p>
      <p>Karen Kylie reminds Blake so much of her aunt — full of life. The little one bops around when her mom starts singing the “Wind the Bobbin Up” nursery rhyme.</p>
      <p>“She’s always dancing … She loves herself,” Blake said. “Isn’t that Karen?”</p>
      <p>Investigators determined that a 3-year-old boy <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/01/12/mom-whose-tot-started-deadly-bronx-fire-sues-for-1b-from-stove-maker-city/">playing with the stove</a> in a first-floor apartment started the dinnertime fire. In a rush to flee the flames, the boy’s mother failed to close the door behind her. Flames spread rapidly, consuming the five-story building at 2363 Prospect Ave.</p>

      <p>Blake and her husband, Gawayne, were asleep in their third-floor apartment when then-10-year-old Jeremiah shouted: “Mommy, I smell smoke!”</p>
      <p>The Blakes were the last family down the fire escape.</p>
      <p>“If not for Jeremiah, we wouldn’t be here today,” Blake said, weeping.</p>
      <p>On the day of the fire, Dec. 28, 2017, Blake was three months pregnant. Karen Kylie was born May 5, 2018.</p>
      <p>“We get to love on a little princess,” Blake said. “We see them through her.”</p>
      <p>Karen Kylie, her mom said, has the facial expressions of Kylie — “if she’s upset she will sit still and stare at you” — and the fierceness of Karen.</p>
      <p>“She knows what she wants and does whatever she has to do to get it … that was my aunt.”</p>
      <p>Since the fire, the Blakes get flustered by the sound of a fire alarm and can smell smoke “a mile away.”</p>
      <p>About a year ago, the Blakes decided to leave the Bronx for a home in Newark.</p>
      <p>“Because the memories were too much,” Blake said. “Jeremiah is terrified of apartment buildings.”</p>

      <p>On Thursday, the Blakes will spend the holiday with dozens of their relatives at her mom’s house in Brick City, feasting on the traditional food of their native Jamaica – fried chicken, oxtail, rice and jerk pork.</p>
      <p>“We’ve always been a big unit,” Blake said. “We mourn together, and we celebrate together. There’s comfort in that you always have a shoulder to lean on.”</p>
      <p>Fifty family members who lost loved ones and the 14 who were injured in the Bronx blaze are <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/08/31/victims-of-deadly-bronx-fire-suing-city-for-100-million/">seeking $100 million in damages from the city</a>; the building owner and manager; and the maker of the door, which was supposed to be self-closing.</p>
      <p>“The whole thing is a tragedy, no matter how you look at,” said attorney Robert Vilensky, who is representing the plaintiffs.</p>
      <p>The family of the boy who started the fire has filed an eye-popping $1.1 billion lawsuit, citing the “negligence” of the city, Con Ed and others.</p>
      <p>Blake said she harbors no ill will toward the boy or his mother, and that faith is the key to her positive outlook. That positivity will be in full bloom Thursday.</p>
      <p>“We grew up in the church and without our faith we wouldn’t be able to cope,” she said. “My aunt would want the party to continue. They would want us to continue to be close and lift them up in memory and not in tears.”</p>
