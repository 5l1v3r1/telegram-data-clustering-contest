      <h1>Man caught with cocaine in car says ‘wind placed it there’</h1>

      <p>A US man has tried to wriggle out of a possession-of-illegal-drug charge, by claiming that the wind blew crack cocaine into his car.</p>
      <p>According to <i><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/florida-man-gets-caught-cocaine-car-says-blown-thereby-wind-1473677?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=NewsweekTwitter&amp;utm_medium=Social">Newsweek</a></i>, Joseph Zak, 37, was pulled over in his sedan in Fort Pierce, Florida earlier in November by police, after he failed to stop at a red light.</p>
      <p>When police caught up with him, the officer noticed that Zak was making “furtive movements” and leaning over towards the centre console in a suspected bid to discard an item. A bottle of beer was also discovered inside the driver’s door.</p>
      <p>According to the report, the officer wrote that during interaction with Zac, it was observed that his behaviour seemed “very confrontational” and that he was “looking around the vehicle as attempting to conceal an item.” Further, his physical appearance was that of bloodshot and glossy eyes, with slurred speech when answering questions.</p>
      <p>After Zak had been arrested, his car was searched and police discovered “a glass round cylinder, commonly used to smoke crack cocaine.” There was also “a clear baggie with residue”, which tested positive crack cocaine.</p>
      <p>In response to the findings,  Zak said that either the police had placed it there or “the wind must have placed it there.”</p>
