      <h2>“Break the silence, not women,” read one sign. “Down with the patriarchy,” read another.</h2>

      <p>Thousands rallied in Paris on Saturday to seek an end to gender violence and femicide in a country where at least 116 women have been killed by current or former partners this year, sparking national outrage.</p>
      <p>The march began near the French capital’s main opera house, with several protesters holding up placards bearing the image of a relative or friend killed in gender violence.</p>
      <p>“Break the silence, not women,” read one sign. “Down with the patriarchy,” read another.</p>
      <p>About 30 marches have been organised throughout France. They involve nearly 70 organisations, political parties, unions and associations.</p>
      <p>The government is expected to announce about 40 measures on Monday to tackle the scourge.</p>
