      <h1>We talked to 4 VC investors about the hottest trends in payments and the biggest innovations to keep an eye on, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:36:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:36</time> by <a rel="author">Shannen Balogh, Business Insider US</a></address>
      <ul>
        <li>We spoke to investors at Andreessen Horowitz, Bain Capital Ventures, Citi Ventures, and Insight Partners to learn where they see the next innovations and opportunities in payments tech.</li>
        <li>Mostly, they’re looking out for ways that payments companies can do more than just process transactions. That may be through add-on services, or even machine-initiated payments.</li>
        <li>Payments is interwoven into nearly every segment of the fintech landscape, from credit-card processing to online sales, to analytics around consumer behavior.</li>
        <li>Some unicorns making waves in payments include AvidXchange, Brex, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wells-fargo-execs-talk-plaid-and-blockchain-2019-9">Plaid</a>, Stripe, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/transferwise-reports-third-straight-year-of-profits-2019-9">TransferWise.</a></li>

      </ul>
      <p>The fintech world is big, and funding is flooding into startups like robo-advisors, neobanks, and alternative lenders.</p>
      <p>In the third quarter this year, total fintech funding topped $8.9 billion, a record when adjusted for Alibaba’s fintech Ant Financial’s $14 billion last year, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/reports/CB-Insights_Fintech-Report-Q3-2019.pdf">according to CB Insights</a>. Globally, there are now 58 fintech unicorns (startups valued at more than $1 billion).</p>
      <p>Payments is interwoven into nearly every segment of the fintech landscape, from credit card processing to online sales to analytics around consumer behavior. Some unicorns that have made big waves in payments include AvidXchange, Brex, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wells-fargo-execs-talk-plaid-and-blockchain-2019-9">Plaid</a>, Stripe, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/transferwise-reports-third-straight-year-of-profits-2019-9">TransferWise.</a></p>
      <p>While some say incumbents should fear competition from fintechs, many existing companies are partnering with startups. Marqeta, which provides card issuing, and Plaid, which helps startups link into consumers’ bank accounts, have inked partnerships with legacy players like <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191028005216/en/Visa-Marqeta-Offer-Fintechs-Path-Growth-World%E2%80%99s">Visa</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wells-fargo-execs-talk-plaid-and-blockchain-2019-9">Wells Fargo</a>.</p>
      <p>Incumbents themselves have made bold moves to stay current, like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mastercard-launches-blockchain-for-seafood-and-healthcare-service-2019-10">Mastercard’s blockchain for shrimp tracking</a>, or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amex-corporate-card-startup-competing-brex-2019-10">American Express’ startup-focused corporate card launch</a>. They’re also making investments through their venture arms. Amex Ventures has backed Plaid and Stripe; Visa has invested in Marqeta and Finix.</p>
      <p>And payments companies are also snapping up ways to expand their services. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/paypal">payments giant PayPal</a> said it <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/paypal-to-acquire-shopping-rewards-platform-honey-4-billion-2019-11">plans to buy Honey,</a> a startup that makes browser shopping add-ons for its customers, for $4 billion, which would be PayPal’s biggest buy ever.</p>
      <p>We spoke to four investors at leading VC firms about where they see the next opportunities when it comes to payments.</p>

      <p>Anish Acharya, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, sees innovations coming not just from payments companies, but from unexpected players into the fintech space.</p>
      <p>The Silicon Valley venture-capital firm is known for its early investments in companies like Facebook and Lyft.
