      <h1>Mourinho makes instant impact</h1>
      <h2>Tottenham gets a much-needed victory</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:09:18+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:09</time> by <a rel="author">Agencies</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho delivered Tottenham’s first away win in the English Premier League since January in his first game in charge with a 3-2 win at West Ham to catapult Spurs up to sixth.</p>
      <p>Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane got the goals as Mourinho made an instant impact after replacing the sacked Mauricio Pochettino on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>A much-needed three points will help to endear Mourinho to a skeptical Spurs support who were sad to see Pochettino’s five-and-a-half year spell in charge of the club end just six months after leading the club to a first ever Champions League final.</p>
      <p>There was no love lost between Mourinho’s Chelsea sides and Tottenham in the past, but his arrival had the desired impact for Spurs chairman Daniel Levy, even if a West Ham team devoid of confidence made for perfect opponents.</p>
      <p>Mourinho followed Pochettino’s example in leaving out Christan Eriksen with the Dane one of a number of Spurs players into the final months of his contract and showing no signs of agreeing a new deal.</p>
      <p>The coach’s decision to field a front four of Dele Alli with Son, Moura and Kane worked.</p>
      <h3>Barcelona sneaks past Leganes</h3>
      <p>In the La Liga, Barcelona needed a late winner from Arturo Vidal to beat bottom-club Leganes 2-1 on Saturday and dig out a much-needed victory ahead of what could prove a crucial month in its season.</p>
      <p>Vidal poked in a fortuitous goal in the 79th minute at Butarque after Luis Suarez headed home a Lionel Messi free-kick to cancel out a brilliant opener from Leganes forward Youssef En-Nesyri.</p>
      <p>A gritty win will also come as a relief to under-pressure coach Ernesto Valverde, whose team now turn their attention to Wednesday’s crunch Champions League group game against Borussia Dortmund at Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>A goalless draw against Slavia Prague earlier this month means Barca’s qualification from Group F is no longer guaranteed.</p>
      <p>After Dortmund, it plays away at Atletico Madrid in La Liga to start a month that will include trips to Inter Milan in the Champions League and Real Sociedad in La Liga before the season’s first Clasico at home to Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>It was important therefore to avoid a slip against Leganes, playing its first game in front of its own fans since appointing Javier Aguirre as coach.</p>
      <h3>Reus rescues Dortmund</h3>
      <p>On Friday, Borussia Dortmund captain Marco Reus scored a stoppage-time equaliser as it dragged itself back from 3-0 down to rescue a 3-3 draw against promoted Paderborn, but it still suffered a dent to its Bundesliga title hopes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The results:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>EPL:</b> West Ham 2 (Antonio 73, Ogbonna 90+6) lost to Tottenham 3 (Son 36, Moura 43, Kane 49).</p>
      <p><b>La Liga:</b> Leganes 1 (En-Nesyri 12) lost to Barcelona 2 (Suarez 53, Vidal 79).</p>
      <p><b>On Friday: La Liga</b>: Levante 2 (Roger 52, Rochina 73) bt Mallorca 1 (Rodriguez 65).</p>
      <p><b>Bundesliga</b>: Borussia Dortmund 3 (Sancho 47, Witsel 84, Reus 90+3) drew with Paderborn 3 (Mamba 5, 37, Holtmann 43).</p>
