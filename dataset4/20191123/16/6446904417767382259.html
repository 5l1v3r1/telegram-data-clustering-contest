      <h2>It follows weeks of heavy rain in the east African country.</h2>

      <p>AT LEAST 34 people have been killed in mudslides that occurred after heavy rains unleashed overnight floods in the western part of Kenya.</p>
      <p>Interior cabinet secretary Fred Matiangi said 17 people died in a mudslide in the village of Takmal in the Pokot Central district, while 12 others lost their lives in mudslides in the villages of Parua and Tapach in Pokot South.</p>
      <p>West Pokot County Commissioner Apollo Okello said five other people died when their car was swept away on the road between Kitale and Lodwar after two rivers overflowed their banks.</p>
      <p>“We are saddened to confirm that 12 people from Tapach and Parua in Pokot South, and 17 from Tamkal in Pokot Central lost their lives,” Matiang’i said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Our profound sympathies go to the families and friends of those who have been affected.”</p>
      <p>Okello also said that two children were pulled out alive from the smashed wreckage of their mud-covered homes.</p>
      <p>Matiangi added that the government had sent military and police helicopters to help those affected by the floods, but that the scope of the disaster was not yet clear.</p>
      <p>“While rescue and recovery efforts remain the priority, a full assessment into the extent of damage caused continues to be a challenge due to harsh weather conditions,” he said.</p>
      <p>More than 1 million people in east Africa have been affected by flooding after higher-than-normal rainfall.</p>
      <p>The latest deaths in Kenya bring to 72 the number of people who have died in a month-and-a-half due to flooding-related causes.</p>
      <p>The International Rescue Committee said this month that many people had been reeling from an earlier severe drought in the region.</p>
      <p>Now rains in parts of Somalia, South Sudan and Kenya are expected for four to six more weeks.</p>
      <p>The torrential rain is uncommon for this time of year. Experts have said the changing weather patterns have a huge impact because close to 100% of Kenya’s agriculture is rain-fed.</p>
      <p>“Massive landslides reported in various areas of West Pokot County following heavy downpour,” Kenya Red Cross said in a message, adding its emergency response teams had deployed to help.</p>
