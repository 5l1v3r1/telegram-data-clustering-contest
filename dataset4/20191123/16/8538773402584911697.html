      <p>Palace thought they opened the scoring through <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/104917/James-Tomkins">James Tomkins</a> just before the break but the goal was ruled out by VAR due to a push on <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/123560/Dejan-Lovren">Dejan Lovren</a> from <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/123518/Jordan-Ayew">Jordan Ayew</a>.</p>
      <p>Liverpool scored minutes into the second half through <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/169797/Sadio-Man%C3%A9">Sadio Mane</a> with their first shot on target.</p>
      <p><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/146324/Wilfried-Zaha">Wilfried Zaha</a> thought he had rescued a point for the hosts with 10 minutes to go before Firmino sealed the win with five minutes remaining.</p>
