      <h2>Teams focussing on reaching out to the tribal population</h2>

      <p>The committee looking after activities under Systematic Voter Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) for the by-election to Hunsur Assembly constituency in Mysuru district has set a goal of carrying out voter awareness campaigns in each village for bringing maximum number of voters to the polling booths.</p>
      <p>Volunteers have identified the booths that saw low voter turnout earlier and they will be given special attention for educating the voters on the need for exercising their franchise.</p>
      <h3>Tour of villages</h3>
      <p>The staff from Hunsur Taluk Panchayat and the gram panchayats on Saturday set out on a tour of villages in motorcycles, carrying attractive messages on voting. The pillion-riders carried the placards with messages in Kannada and English exhorting voters to cast their ballot. The SVEEP volunteers covered as many as 26 villages on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Hunsur Taluk Panchayat Executive Officer Girish, who flagged off the rally in the town on Saturday, told <i>The Hindu </i>that the idea is to reach out to every village with an appeal on not to miss voting.</p>
      <p>“We are playing a recorded message wherever the volunteers visit on why voting is important, and also interact with the residents, holding meetings.”</p>
      <p>This election, along with the distribution of voter slips by the BLOs, pamphlets with details on using electronic voting machines (EVMs) and also about the VVPATs will be distributed.</p>
      <p>Hunsur constituency has a sizeable population of primitive tribes residing in settlements close to the forests.</p>
      <p>The SVEEP teams are also focussing on reaching out to the tribal populations by visiting their “haadis” and encouraging them to participate in the democratic process.</p>
      <p>Mr. Girish said he and the SVEEP volunteers visited a couple of “haadis” and interacted with the tribals.</p>
      <p>They were told about the by-election on December 5 and sensitised about their roles as voters.</p>
      <p>Hunsur has 2,27,974 voters, including 1,14,146 male and 1,12,769 female voters.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, 1,534 voters opted for ‘NOTA’ in the last election.</p>
