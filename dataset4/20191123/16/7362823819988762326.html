      <h1>Bougainville in the Pacific could become world’s newest nation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:33:48+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:33</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Gearty</a></address>
      <p>Residents of a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/tonga-sent-back-to-dark-ages-after-underwater-internet-cable-severed">Pacific archipelago</a> started voting Saturday in a historic referendum that could lead to the establishment of the world’s newest nation.</p>
      <p>The two-week vote will decide if <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/woman-makes-sure-decorated-wwii-marine-gets-heros-farewell">Bougainville</a> favors independence from Papua New Guinea or more autonomy.</p>
      <p>The referendum is taking place 19 years after a peace agreement ended a brutal, decade-long civil war in Bougainville in which 15,000 people died.</p>
      <p>Official observers don’t expect violence to mar voting.</p>

      <p>“They’ve been waiting 19 years for this historic moment,” said Gianluca Rampolla, the United Nations resident coordinator in Papua New Guinea. “I think they will be left with joy.”</p>
      <p>The 250,000 eligible voters will have two weeks to vote, a period of time that is due to the region’s rugged terrain.</p>
      <p>“There are people coming on boats,” Rampolla said. “There are people walking. It’s the rainy season. There are rough seas. Flexibility is needed to adjust on the ground.”</p>
