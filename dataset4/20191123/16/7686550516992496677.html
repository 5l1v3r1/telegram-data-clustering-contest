      <h1>Dan Biggar mobbed by team-mates as he shows nerves of steel with 85th minute match-winning kick</h1>
      <h2>Northampton fly-half Biggar was the key man for the second week in a row in Europe</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:28:15+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:28</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Thomas</a></address>
      <p>When the clock is in the red, the scores are tied and you’ve got a kick to win the game, who else would want to take it but Dan Biggar?</p>
      <p>That was the scenario for Northampton out in Italy this afternoon and their ever-reliable Wales fly-half was more than up to the challenge.</p>
      <p>Biggar showed typical nerves of steel as he landed an angled penalty with the final kick of the game to earn the Saints a 35-32 victory away to Benetton in a thrilling Champions Cup encounter.</p>
      <p>After sending the ball straight between the posts, he was mobbed by his jubilant team-mates, while there were equally animated scenes amid the band of travelling supporters.</p>
      <p>It was his sixth successful shot at goal as he finished with a 15-point haul on a eventful day, which also saw him set up a try with some great hands and pick up a yellow card.</p>
      <p>While a number of Wales’ front-line World Cup stars are still on a break from the game, the 79-cap Biggar is now two weeks into his return to action and has certainly made his mark.</p>
      <p>Last weekend, he was named Man of the Match after producing a flawless kicking display in contributing 20 points to a 25-14 victory over Lyon in the Champions Cup opener at Franklin’s Gardens.</p>
      <p>And now he has booted Northampton to a bonus point victory out in Treviso, which has taken them to the top of Pool 1 for the time being, with head-to-head games against Irish giants Leinster to come in December.</p>
      <p>It was a real topsy turvy encounter, with Benetton racing into a 25-8 lead only for the Saints to fight back and go ahead 32-25, with the scores then level at 32-32 going into Biggar’s big moment.</p>

      <p>Once a match-winner, always a match winner.</p>
      <p>Following the victory over Lyon, Northampton coach Chris Boyd dubbed Biggar “the best in the world at what he does”.</p>
      <p>And after watching him win this match, Boyd said: "He doesn't miss very often at all and in those key situations he's as good as anyone in the world.</p>
      <p>"We knew through that phase once Jamie Gibson had got the turnover that if we could get some field position and force an error or find a hole, three points would be enough to win."</p>
      <p>Former Ospreys star Biggar is unavailable to new Wales coach Wayne Pivac for next Saturday’s match against the Barbarians as the game is outside the Test window and English clubs are not allowed to release players to other countries for such fixtures.</p>
      <p>So Biggar will be otherwise engaged with the East Midlands derby at home to Leicester in the Gallagher Premiership.</p>
      <p>But given his current form, the 30-year-old would have to be a front-runner to wear the No 10 jersey for Wales in the Six Nations, with Gareth Anscombe and Rhys Patchell both out injured.</p>

      <p>Asked, following the Lyon game, what it was like returning to action just two weeks after the culmination of the World Cup campaign in Japan, he said: “It was really easy.</p>
      <p>“It always helps when you’re coming back to winning and a positive environment.</p>
      <p>“Everyone’s made me feel welcome and it’s great to see all the good work that has been going on here while I’ve been away.</p>
      <p>“This is my bread and butter.</p>
      <p>“It’s a real privilege to be part of this club to be honest. It’s great to be back.”</p>
