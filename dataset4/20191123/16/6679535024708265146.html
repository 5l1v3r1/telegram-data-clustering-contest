      <h1>Student commits suicide; parents demand action against teacher</h1>

      <p>A plus one student was found dead in her house here on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Police said that the girl identified as Maria Iswarya, 16, daughter of Anthony Karunakaran and Selvi lived in Arockiapuram.</p>
      <p>It is suspected that she was scolded by her teacher in the school in front of other students. So, she took the extreme decision to end herself.</p>
      <p>The school authorities maintained that the student was absent for two days and the teacher concerned questioned the girl about this, a police officer said after preliminary inquiry.</p>
      <p>However, the parents and relatives of Maria Iswarya said that as her grandmother had passed away, she had to take leave.</p>
      <p>Under such circumstances, without ascertaining the facts, the manner in which the teacher handled the student, resulted in mental agony.</p>
      <p>When the parents were away, Maria Iswarya allegedly hanged herself to death in her house.</p>
      <p>Police investigations were on. Meanwhile, for a brief period, the relatives demanded the arrest of the teacher and the school authorities.</p>
      <p>Assistance for overcoming suicidal thoughts is available on the State’s health helpline 104 and Sneha’s suicide prevention helpline 044-24640050.</p>
