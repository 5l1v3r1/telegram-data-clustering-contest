      <h1>Arsenal player ratings: Lucas Torreira and Alexandre Lacazette save Unai Emery... for now</h1>
      <h2>How the individual players fared in the Gunners' 2-2 draw with Southampton at the Emirates Stadium</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:57:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:57</time> by <a rel="author">James Benge</a></address>
      <p><b>Bernd Leno:</b> As ever could do little when his defence switched off to allow Danny Ings to score the opener, nor was he able to stop James Ward-Prowse converting the rebound after he finally saved a penalty. When called upon Leno performed admirably, saving well from Lucas Torreira early in the second half and tipping over a powerful Nathan Redmond drive. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Calum Chambers:</b> With Hector Bellerin struggling ahead of him Chambers at times seemed to struggle to deal with the incursions of Ryan Bertrand, Nathan Redmond and Ings.</p>
      <p>Going forward he was far more involved - attempting as many passes by the 40th minute as Mesut Ozil, Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang combined - but that was more reflective of Unai Emery's remarkably cautious gameplan than any quality from Chambers in possession. <b>5</b></p>
      <p><b>David Luiz:</b> No defender covered themselves in glory for Southampton's opener but Luiz's error was perhaps the most egregious; when Nathan Redmond took the quick free-kick he was not even facing in the right direction. Several months into what was always viewed as a short-term spell at Arsenal he looks more like the figure of fun he was at his worst at Chelsea than the defensive rock he can be.<b> 4</b></p>
      <p><b>Sokratis Papastathopoulos:</b> The Greek centre-back does not seem to impose himself on opposing forwards this season as he did at his best last term. A catastrophic error trying to play out from the back saw him hand possession to Cedric in his own area and Southampton were a better cross away from a second. <b>4</b></p>
      <p><b>Hector Bellerin:</b> Heavy touches, loose passing and a yard of pace that isn't quite there yet were the orders of the day for Bellerin, who still looks some way from the full-back he was before being cut down through injury. Inevitably it will take time before he is back to his best but his cause was not aided by being tasked with running the right flank effectively on his own. <b>4</b></p>

      <p><b>Lucas Torreira:</b> Seemingly determined to prove his manager wrong for questioning his ability to play as a defensive midfielder Torreira started this match in explosive fashion, throwing himself into tackles and passing the ball neatly.</p>
      <p>That was combined with the driving presence from deep that Emery wants to bring out of the Uruguayan in a match where he was among the few players who emerged with his copy book unblemished. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Matteo Guendouzi:</b> The youngster's season has been defined by his determination to be Arsenal's saviour but this was one of those games where he was trying to hard to change the contest rather than keep his team moving forward.</p>
      <p>All too often ambitious long balls drifted through to Alex McCarthy and attempts to push through midfield saw Guendouzi run into opposition road blocks. <b>5</b></p>
      <p><b>Kieran Tierney:</b> A clumsy touch early on invited Stuart Armstrong to strike at goal but from then on Tierney set about making up for the error, setting the Gunners on course for parity with a brilliant cross from which Alexandre Lacazette would eventually convert.</p>
      <p>Tierney may well feel aggrieved to have conceded the penalty from which James Ward-Prowse scores but it was a foul he did not need to make. <b>5</b></p>
      <p><b>Mesut Ozil:</b> Even a player as great as Ozil can only make so much from the scraps he was given. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and James Ward-Prowse made for an effective shield in central areas but the German's struggles were as much to do with the slow pace of Arsenal's build-up as his opposition's tactics.</p>
      <p>On the rare occasions where he did get the ball before Southampton could organise he was impressive indeed, gliding into the box on one occasion in the first half only for the visitors to block off his cross. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Alexandre Lacazette:</b> A first goal since September 1 brought an almost immediate revival in Lacazette's fortunes as the close control and eye for a pass that had evaded him on his return from injury earlier this month came back to the fore.</p>
      <p>Emery will doubtless be grateful beyond words for Lacazette's late strike, a goal that for now may just have saved his job. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang:</b> A familiar tale for Aubameyang, who was utterly starved of service in the first half. More than any player he simply cannot make a significant contribution when Arsenal are so cautious. <b>5</b></p>
      <p><b>Nicolas Pepe (sub, Chambers, 46'): </b>His introduction immediately sparked life into Arsenal, who finally had the width and incision they lacked throughout the second half. He perhaps should have shot when played through by Lacazette but an ambitious scissor kick very nearly got him the open play goal he needs to jump start his career in England. <b>5</b></p>
