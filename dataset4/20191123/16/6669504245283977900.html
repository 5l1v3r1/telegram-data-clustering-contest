      <p>Vernon Fire Rescue was called to a home on Vernon's 38th Avenue Friday after the tenant reported flames and heavy smoke in the basement.</p>
      <p>Firefighters arrived around 3:30 p.m. and doused the fire burning in the utility room.</p>
      <p>"The fire was contained to a single room," said Deputy Chief Dwight Seymour. "There is minimal fire and water damage to the house, but a fair bit of smoke damage, so the tenants of the home will need to stay out of the house for at least one night."</p>
      <p>Emergency Social Services was on scene to assist the tenants. RCMP and BC Ambulance Service also attended the scene, but no injuries were reported.</p>
      <p>An investigation will begin this evening, but Deputy Chief Seymour said the fire does not appear to be suspicious.</p>
      <p>VFRS would like to remind community members about the importance of checking your smoke detectors regularly to ensure they are working properly in case of an emergency</p>
