      <p>Are you someone who is happier not wearing clothes? If so, this might just be the thing for you.</p>
      <p>A naturist group in Newcastle is looking for new members to join its upcoming nude swim, sauna and steam room.</p>
      <p>Three Rivers Outdoor Club members have been taking their kit off for more than 30 years and are hoping to see some new recruits at their next session.</p>

      <p>The naturist group hires West Denton Pool in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-upon-tyne">Newcastle</a> for members to enjoy the benefits of social nakedness every few weeks with the latest session taking place on Saturday, November 23.</p>
      <p>The next organised naked swim is on Saturday December 14 from 5pm - 7pm.</p>
      <p>Organiser Rob said: "We understand that it can be a bit daunting for first timers, so they are welcome to wear a wrap or a beach towel until they feel comfortable.</p>
      <p>"If you would like a chat over a coffee beforehand, Nikki and Allan will be happy to chat to you about swim or naturism, from 3pm in the café in Morrisons just next door to the pool. Just look for a swimming towel on the table."</p>
      <p>The club is hoping to build on the success of the North East Skinny Dip, where hundreds of people strip off for a bracing plunge in the North Sea to raise cash for mental health charities.</p>

      <p>Fellow organiser Nikki says women are more reluctant to bare all than men, something she is keen to put right.</p>
      <p>She added: "It’s exhilarating and liberating to be naked in a welcoming environment where everyone accepts you as you are and no one is making any judgements about your body or your appearance. It does wonders for your self-confidence, particularly as a woman."</p>
      <p>To join in, you must be 18 or over and have a valid photo ID on the first visit with membership not required beforehand.</p>
