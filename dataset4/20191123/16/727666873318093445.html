      <h1>R. Kelly "Sex Slave" Joycelyn Savage Is Telling Everything...For Money!</h1>

      <p>Joycelyn Savage posts eerie Instagram message that has us on our toes.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop Rumors)</b> We all know the drama that’s transpired with R.Kelly. </p>
      <p>We’re aware of the allegations and I’m pretty sure the Lifetime TV documentary series, <i>Surviving R. Kelly </i>is somewhere recorded under our DVR. Kelly is currently in prison serving who knows how long on numerous charges including kidnapping, forced labor, child pornography, and many other disturbing charges.</p>
      <p>This is probably one of the most high profile cases of our time having everyone waiting to hear what’s next.</p>
      <p>If you’ve watched the documentary, you’re familiar with Joycelyn Savage, 23, one of Kels live-in girlfriends. Savage and Azriel Clary, 21, also one of Kelly’s girlfriends, have been standing by their man throughout the entire ordeal.</p>
      <p>Savages’ parents have been all over social media and TV speaking out against their daughter who they believe to be imprisoned.</p>
      <p>Joycelyn’s may have a story to tell, at least that’s what we’re getting from her cryptic Instagram message.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“There’s something I need to reveal. Something I should’ve talked about a long time ago. This is my story!”</i>
      </p>
      <p>In a follow up post, Joycelyn revealed she is going to tell her ENTIRE story chapter by chapter, using Patreon!</p>
      <p>"Things I am going to reveal that was sweared not to see the day of light — by NDA. I am risking my life for many others. This story is 18+ and only for mature audience, I want to make sure my story is very detailed as I can remember. My first story “Where It All Started” is out now. Patreon.com/Joycelynsavage (Link is bio) 🙏🏼</p>
      <p>Sips tea. What do you think she’s about to reveal?</p>
