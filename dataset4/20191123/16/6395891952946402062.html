      <p><b>PROVIDENCE, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - Members of Rhode Island's congressional delegation are visiting small businesses to encourage residents to shop local this holiday season.</p>
      <p>U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin are scheduled to visit eight businesses in downtown Westerly Tuesday, to promote Small Business Saturday.</p>
      <p>Small Business Saturday, which takes place on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, started in 2010 to encourage consumers to shop in their small local stores rather than national chains.</p>
      <p>The Rhode Island Democrats will be joined on the tour by representatives from the U.S. Small Business Administration, Rhode Island Foundation and Ocean Community Chamber of Commerce.</p>
      <p>Reed says small businesses are a major part of communities and Rhode Island's economy. He says Small Business Saturday is a great way to celebrate and support local merchants.</p>
