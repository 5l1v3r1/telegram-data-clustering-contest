      <p>The first clue was "Shake a Bush" which some clever commenters deciphered as Wavertree.</p>
      <p>Other clues included "Wet Toilet" - Waterloo, "The Execution of a reptile" - Croxteth, and "Talk" - Speke.</p>
      <p>But others simply eluded people on Twitter, with many commenting on how difficult some of the clues were.</p>
      <p>Hannah said: "This is proper hurting my head."</p>
      <p>@joer_j said: "Can only get about 5 of them."</p>
      <p>But Lee Mc said: "These are boss." and asked if Mandy had anymore to share.</p>
      <p>Others were sad there was no clue for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/funniest-reader-comments-crocodile-found-17263662">Fazakerley -</a> although we're unsure what that would have possibly been.</p>
