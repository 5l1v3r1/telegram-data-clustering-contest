      <h1>Avengers: Endgame Art Book Reveals Black Widow's Ronin Costume</h1>

      <p>With the release of the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/avengers-4/"><i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a> art book, audiences are finally getting an inside look into a plethora of unused ideas for Marvel Studios' biggest film to date. Specifically, one of the many scrapped ideas for the film looks to have included Natasha Romanoff (aka Black Widow) donning her own version of the Ronin costume.</p>
      <p>Wesley Burt, concept artist for Marvel Studios, commented on the idea, stating, "We thought the idea would be cool to have matching palettes because they were going to be paired off on their journey together, I think originally there was going to be a scene where we see these two masked people fighting and the audience doesn't know who they are, and then there would be a reveal that it's Clint and Natasha." Burt concluded with, "So that was some of the mask and hood stuff -- strictly for a reveal. I was also pushing for different hairstyles and other stuff too."</p>
