      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:54:30+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Just as Crystal Palace had equalised late on through Wilfried Zaha, Roberto Firmino put the Reds back in front again at Selhurst Park in the Premier League – making it 2-1 to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold swung in a brilliant corner kick that forced a goalmouth scramble, and then the Brazilian was there to poke home his fourth goal of the season so far.</p>
      <p>Watch the goal, which could be a crucial moment in Liverpool’s season, below, via Bein Sport’s coverage:</p>
