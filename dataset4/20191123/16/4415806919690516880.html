      <p>Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has said the Labour election campaign is “bombing”.</p>
      <p>Mr Farage was speaking about Jeremy Corbyn’s decision to remain “neutral” in a mooted second EU referendum, as he visited market stallholders in Hartlepool.</p>
      <p>He said the Labour leader’s stance, which he revealed on BBC’s Question Time on Friday, showed a “failure of leadership”.</p>

      <p>Speaking to the PA news agency as he stopped for a drink at the King John Tavern, Mr Farage said: “Brexit is the defining issue of our day and the leader of the Labour Party is going to abstain from that.</p>
      <p>“I find that astonishing. It’s a failure of leadership. It’s also a reflection that he knows his own parliamentary party are Remainers… so he’s still trying to stay on that fence and it’s not working.</p>
      <p>“And I think, frankly, people would say just come down on one side or the other and I think my feeling is the Labour campaign is bombing and that last night made it worse.”</p>
      <p>Mr Farage added that the Brexit Party could win Labour seats in the election if it attracted ballots from Conservative voters.</p>
      <p>He said patriotic voters in places like Hartlepool would vote for his party because of their view of Mr Corbyn.</p>
      <p>He said: “I think the Brexit issue is huge, I think the patriotic issue is huge, I think Corbyn is not seen as being very patriotic and I think if Conservative voters in these areas realise that we’re the challenger and come to us, then we could (beat Labour), absolutely.”</p>
      <p>Mr Farage said resolving the Brexit issue would help restore the public’s faith in politics.</p>
      <p>“What was interesting though, and I felt it when I did it, from the audience last night was the sheer level of hostility.</p>
      <p>“This is real, people are very angry with politics, their faith and trust in Parliament, politicians, has never, ever been lower and goodness me it shows.</p>
      <p>“This is why, actually, getting Brexit done properly will allow us to get people to believe that if they vote for something it might actually happen.”</p>

      <p>Mr Farage arrived in Hartlepool on the Brexit Party battle bus and visited the Market Hall in Middleton Grange shopping centre.</p>
      <p>Wearing a flat cap and calf-length wax jacket, Mr Farage spoke to a number of stallholders and bought a caramel slice and a £1.29 Christmas card for his mother.</p>
      <p>Mr Farage later joined canvassers knocking on doors in Hartlepool.</p>
      <p>Speaking as he walked through the residential area, he said he believed there would be a low turnout in the election.</p>
      <p>But several voters on the doorstep said he had their vote.</p>
      <p>Kenneth Melvin, a former Labour voter, said he would be voting for the Brexit Party because he could not trust Labour.</p>
      <p>Debbie Franks, a Weight Watchers coach, said she was still undecided but would not vote for either of the two main parties.</p>
