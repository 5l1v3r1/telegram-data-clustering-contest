      <h1>Seven towns in Notts need on-call firefighters: Here's where they are and how much they pay</h1>
      <h2>You can earn an annual retainer - plus call-out fees</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:54:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:54</time> by <a rel="author">David Whitfield</a></address>
      <p>If you fancy getting a bit of extra money while also giving something back to your community, being an on-call firefighter might be ideal for you.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottinghamshire-fire-and-rescue-service">Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service</a> is currently recruiting on-call firefighters who can provide cover at seven fire stations in the county.</p>
      <p>These are at Bingham, Collingham, Hucknall, Misterton, Retford, Southwell and Tuxford.</p>
      <p>However, the service will also consider applications for Ashfield, Blidworth, Eastwood, East Leake, Newark, Warsop, and Worksop.</p>
      <p>Here's what you need to know.</p>
      <h3>What's the commitment?</h3>
      <p>You must be able to offer at least 84 hours of fire cover each week. That's the time that you are available to be called out if needed.</p>
      <p>(A full-cover firefighter provides more than 120 hours of cover each week, whilst a part-cover firefighter provides between 84 and 120 each week.)</p>
      <p>The hours that you are available for calls can vary according to personal and professional circumstances, and can be fitted around full-time jobs and childcare commitments. However, at the moment the focus is on applicants who can provide cover during daytime hours (8am to 6pm).</p>
      <p>During these hours you need to be within a five minute drive (at normal road speed) of your designated fire station.</p>
      <p>You will be alerted to incidents by a pager. When you are alerted, you must stop what you are doing and immediately travel to the fire station.</p>
      <p>It's hard to say exactly how many times you will be called out, as incidents are unpredictable. But on average you're looking at being paged around 2-3 times a week.</p>

      <h3>What's the job?</h3>
      <p>On-call staff are trained to the same standards as full-time firefighters.</p>
      <p>Firefighters respond to emergency calls when required. These calls can be to a range of incidents including fires, road traffic collisions, animal rescues, rescues from height and water, chemical incidents and even flooding.</p>
      <p>You will also be doing community work. This involves running community events giving advice to local people on how to stay safe. Crews also go into people's homes, businesses and schools to deliver this advice and support.</p>
      <p>You will also need to attend regular training.</p>
      <h3>What's the pay?</h3>
      <p>On-call firefighters get paid a yearly 'retainer fee' regardless of how many calls they attend.</p>
      <p>If you are on call for 84 hours a week, the fee varies between £1,743 for a trainee to £2,336 for a competent firefighter.</p>
      <p>You then get an hourly rate for the attendance of calls and training, which again varies, this time between £10.76 and £14.22.</p>
      <p>In addition to the above, all on-call firefighters get paid a £4.10 disturbance fee each time they are paged and attend the station.</p>
      <h3>What do I need in order to apply?</h3>
      <p>You must live or work within a five minute drive (at normal road speed) of your local fire station.</p>
      <p>You must be aged 18 or over on the date that your training begins.</p>
      <p>There is no height restriction and you don't have to be exceptionally strong. However, you do need to have a good level of fitness, and you will need to successfully complete various physical tests to be eligible.</p>
      <p>The application window for these positions closes on December 8, 2019. You can apply <a href="https://itrent01.notts-fire.gov.uk/tlive_webrecruitment/wrd/run/etrec106gf.display_srch_all?wvid=0444650X8f">here</a>.</p>
