      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/avengers/">Avengers</a>: Endgame writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have opened up about avoiding a ‘bloodbath’ and allowing Thor to live.</p>
      <p>Well, someone had to.</p>
      <p>After <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/26/who-dies-in-avengers-endgame-all-the-heartbreaking-spoilers-9312603/">we tragically lost heroes including Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson)</a>, a tiny ray of hope was presented to mourning Marvel fans in the form of the survival of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) among others.</p>
      <p>Chatting about the surviving Avengers, Stephen explained: ‘We could have had a bloodbath and all six of them gone down swinging, but that seemed even more depressing.’</p>

      <p>Um, no thank you.</p>
      <p>Chatting about the surviving duo, he added: ‘It’s not necessarily that we knew they’d get more stories, it’s just that…Thor has sacrificed and sacrificed and lost and lost.</p>
      <p>‘It’s not a good ending to kill him. To have him finally, reasonably content with himself—and with his current weight, by the way [is more satisfying].’</p>

      <p>He went on to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/avengers-endgame-writers-alternate-storylines">tell Vanity Fair:</a> ‘There’s a joy in letting him go off aimlessly into the ends of the universe. And Clint got his family back, and that’s something. That’s the whole reason he was doing it.’</p>
      <p>Don’t get us all emotional again. We’ve still not fully recovered.</p>
      <p>However, it’s been made clear that the fates of the heroes aren’t always set in stone, as casting director Sarah Finn previously <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/marvel-casting-director-reveals-black-widow-might-different-ending-wasnt-avengers-scarlett-johansson-11179591/">revealed Black Widow was only meant to feature in one film.</a></p>

      <p>And then Scarlett came along.</p>
      <p>‘Maybe it would have just been in one or two films,’ Finn <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/iron-man-endgame-how-marvel-cast-avengers-1253788">told The Hollywood Reporter.</a></p>
      <p>‘But I think her take on the character was so compelling and thoughtful that it grew to where she’s really becoming a selfless leader, which is not where Natasha starts.’</p>

      <p>The character went on to become a beloved staple in the MCU,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/21/scarlett-johansson-teases-black-widows-flawed-side-marvel-announce-release-date-10435210/"> with Scarlett starring in her solo movie Black Widow</a>, which is set for release in May 2020.</p>
