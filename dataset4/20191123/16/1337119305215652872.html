      <p>If you’re in the market for a smart speaker, we’ve got you covered with a roundup of the best <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/19/20971267/smart-speaker-deals-black-friday-amazon-echo-apple-google-home-nest">Black Friday deals on Amazon Echo and Google Home speakers</a>. But smart displays might be a better choice if you want a device that you can use to play music and also showcase your photos and make video calls.</p>
      <p>Like many popular electronic gadgets, smart displays from Amazon and Google Nest are getting all kinds of discounts over Black Friday. Whether you’re looking for one with a camera or a more private option without, here’s your guide to those sales, which are happening at several different retailers.</p>
      <h3>Google</h3>
      <p>The Nest Hub will be $79 on <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/google_nest_hub">the Google Store</a> and <a href="https://fave.co/2PU0CJ2">at Target</a> on Black Friday. That’s $50 off of its original retail price, but it usually costs around $99, which it currently costs <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Hub-Charcoal%2F473535403&amp;subId1=xid:fr1574373752719gid">at Walmart</a>. You will be able to get two of them for $129, the original price of one, at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-hub%2Fprod22640045%3Fxid%3Dcatalog_blackfriday%26pid%3D_Aff_LS%26siteID%3Dtv2R4u9rImY-9URDFx.iRhIK5GMVjY8y_w%26ranMID%3D38733%26ranEAID%3Dtv2R4u9rImY%26ranSiteID%3Dtv2R4u9rImY-9URDFx.iRhIK5GMVjY8y_w%26pubNAME%3DSkimlinks%2B%2528Variable%2BPricing%2529&amp;referrer=theverge.com">Sam’s Club</a> starting at 7AM on Black Friday.</p>
      <p>The Nest Hub Max (pictured above), on the other hand, is getting its first discount: $30 off for a price of $199 on <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/google_nest_hub_max">the Google Store</a>. The Nest Hub Max is larger than the Nest Hub, and it features a camera that you can use for video chatting.</p>

      <p>Amazon is also discounting its line of smart displays, the Echo Show, all of which feature a camera and a hardware slider to cover it up.</p>
      <p>Amazon has Ring doorbell and Echo Show bundles for sale. The <a href="https://amzn.to/2CVnxMu">Ring Video Doorbell Pro bundled with the Echo Show 5</a> is $189, saving you $149.99 if you purchased them separately (though you’ll need doorbell wiring to get this one set up). Together, the <a href="https://amzn.to/32Y8qwn">Ring Video Doorbell 2 and the Echo Show 5</a> are priced at $139, which would cost you only $10 more than purchasing the doorbell by itself. The Video Doorbell 2 doesn’t require any wiring; just mount it to your door or siding.</p>
      <p>Starting on Thanksgiving Day, the <a href="https://amzn.to/2NpWte8">Echo Show</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Charcoal/dp/B07HZLHPKP/ref=sr_1_1?crid=M21OQ3BJF9HE&amp;keywords=echo+show+5&amp;qid=1571869876&amp;s=electronics&amp;sprefix=echo+show+5%2Celectronics%2C183&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=theverge02-20"> 5</a> will be marked down to $49.99 (originally $99.99), which is the lowest price that we’ve seen for it at Amazon. You can save $50 on the <a href="https://amzn.to/331fXui">Echo Show 8</a>, which will be on sale for $79.99. The <a href="https://amzn.to/33rQj2M">Echo Show (second-gen)</a>, normally priced at $229.99, will be $149.99.</p>
