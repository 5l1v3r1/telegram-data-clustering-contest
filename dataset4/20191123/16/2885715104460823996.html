      <p>The resolution also stated that Ajit Pawar’s right to issue a whip has also been revoked. NCP authorized the party supremo Sharad Pawar and Jayant Patil to decide the party’s stand given the current circumstances.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Sharad Pawar maintained that it was his nephew’s personal choice to side with Fadnavis and not that of the party after Ajit gave the political tale in the state a twist. On Twitter, Senior Pawar wrote: “Ajit Pawar’s decision to support the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> to form the Maharashtra Government is his personal decision and not that of the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/nationalist-congress-party-ncp/">Nationalist Congress Party</a> (NCP). We place on record that we do not support or endorse this decision of his.”</p>
