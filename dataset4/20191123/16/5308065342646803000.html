      <p>Hong Kong celebrity Cecilia Cheung has been making so many trips to Singapore that some people said she should be named an honorary Singaporean by now.</p>
      <p>She just visited the island-state and she is keeping it pretty low-key.</p>
      <p>Based on clues in her Instagram Stories, the 39-year-old mum shared her day out on November 15 and someone recognised the place as Kiztopia at Marina Square.</p>
      <p>Her son (most likely one-year-old Marcus) was spotted climbing about in a ball pit. Cecilia is seen taking some time to try her hand at one of the claw machines and she won a unicorn plushie.</p>

      <p>Taking a photo with a fan, she wrote that the place is full of fun.</p>
      <p>In April, the celebrity was in Singapore for her guest appearance at the Star Awards 2019.</p>
      <p>Food was the first priority in mind for her and her companions.</p>
      <p>On her social media accounts, there were photos of Cecilia eating a meal of roasted meat and rice while her companions ate bak kut teh.</p>
      <p>It looked like the location was a dingy Kopitiam at Balestier which is famous for stalls selling roasted duck rice and mushroom minced meat noodles.</p>
      <p>For the recent trip, Cecilia dug in on some Nyonya vegetarian cuisine at a restaurant located at Marina Square.</p>
      <p>The star also shopped at Pedder on Scotts.</p>
      <p>Cecilia celebrated her son Marcus’ first birthday with friends, showing a clear partial view of his face.</p>

      <p>Cecilia has two sons other than Marcus – Lucas, 12 and Quintus, nine, whom she shares with ex-husband Hong Kong actor-chef Nicholas Tse.</p>
      <p>Marcus’ father’s identity is unknown with Cecilia keeping her lips shut about it.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.asiaone.com/entertainment/cecilia-cheung-holiday-singapore-did-you-spot-her-these-places">Media reports say</a> Cecilia temporarily closed her fashion boutique in Central after the backlash on her social media post.</p>
      <p>She had weighed in on the Hong Kong protests by posting a quote by Chinese president Xi Jinping.</p>
      <p>Maybe the reason for the trip to Singapore was due to the hiatus of her business and Marcus’ birthday?</p>
      <p>Singapore is a familiar spot for her as she lived here for some time after her divorce with Nicholas in 2011.</p>
      <p>In July, Cecilia brought Lucas and Quintus to Sentosa during their school holidays.</p>
