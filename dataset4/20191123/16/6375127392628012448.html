      <h3>The Philippine Volcanoes got a show of support from Globe before leaving to compete in the biggest rugby event in Asia that will decide which team will join host Japan in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.</h3>
      <p>With Globe Chairman Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala leading the send-off ceremony,  the Volcanoes will battle Guam, Hong Kong, India, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates on November 23 and 24 in Incheon, South Korea for the remaining slot for Asia in the Rugby Sevens event of the Summer Games next year in Japan.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been a great believer in sports. It brings national unity and brings our distinct communities of Filipinos from different backgrounds together. I think we have tremendous talent here. I wish you much luck and have no doubt that you guys will be there and make the country proud,” Zobel said.</p>
      <p>While the quest to compete in the biggest stage is daunting, the Volcanoes remain upbeat on their chances to bring home the last ticket in the Asia Olympic Qualifying Tournament.</p>
      <p>“The opposition is very strong. We can’t discount the determination of the other teams to get into the Olympics especially Hong Kong and host South Korea. All teams participating in Incheon are expected to give their all and leave everything on the pitch. But we are equally steadfast too to make it to the Tokyo Games and bring honor and glory to our country,” Jake Letts, former national player and now Philippine Volcanoes General Manager, added.</p>
      <p>Globe has been supporting rugby and the Philippine Volcanoes since 2010. Two years ago the company renewed its partnership with the national team specifically to help the team qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Games.</p>
      <p>The Volcanoes are just one tournament away from fulfilling this goal set several years ago. They will also  try to become the first Filipino rugby team ever to qualify in the Olympic Games.</p>
      <p>Ernest John Obiena became the first Filipino athlete to qualify in the 2020 Tokyo Summer Games when he hurdled the Olympic Standard of 5.80 meters for men’s pole vault at the Salto Con L’asta in Piazza Chiari 2019 in Italy last September.</p>
      <p>He was followed by gymnast Carlos Yulo after the Filipino dynamo ruled the 49th FIG Artistic Gymnastic World Championships last month. Yulo is the first-ever Filipino to win the gold medal at the prestigious FIG World Championship.</p>
