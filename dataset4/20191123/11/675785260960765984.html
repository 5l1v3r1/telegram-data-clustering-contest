      <h1>UK weather forecast: Met Office warns of 5 days of rain - more than December average</h1>
      <h2>The South West has been told to brace for rain that will last until at least Wednesday with up to 2.5 inches to fall in places - topping December's average of 2.1 inches</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:27:36+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:27</time> by <a rel="author">Toby Meyjes, Ben Weich, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/toby-meyjes/</a></address>
      <p>Brits have been told to brace for three weeks' of rain in a matter of days after the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> issued a FIVE day <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> warning.</p>
      <p>The miserable weather that has battered the country throughout November looks set to continue with the South West told to brace for 2.5 inches of rain before Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The succession of downpours will bring more rain than the monthly average for the whole of December.</p>
      <p>The fresh warnings that last until the middle of next week were issued today and follow on from warnings that already spanned this weekend.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the Met Office said Dartmoor and the south Devon area would be worst hit, with between 1.1 and 1.6 inches of rain predicted to fall on Tuesday afternoon alone.</p>
      <p>She said: "In the 24 hours until midnight last night, there has already been 24.2 millimeters (0.95 in) of rain in Harberton and south Dartmoor.</p>
      <p>"There will be showers on Monday in the daytime, and again probably south Devon will be the worst hit because of the wind direction. We could see anywhere between 10 and 15mm (0.4-0.6in) in just a couple of hours.</p>

      <p>"It's not an unusual amount for the whole day, but it will fall in the space of just a couple of hours.</p>
      <p>"On Tuesday afternoon there will be heavy rain. It is possible we could see 30-40mm (1.18-1.57in) over high ground, in the afternoon into the evening, and it will already be very saturated at that point."</p>
      <p>Firefighters in Devon and Cornwall have warned drivers to stay away from flooded areas.</p>
      <p>The Environment Agency has published several flood warnings for today in the South West - alerting the public that the river Teign and river Clyst could both burst their banks.</p>
      <p>It said that flood waters could be "deep and fast-flowing," and that homes and businesses in low-lying areas could be flooded.<br/>The Environment Agency urged nearby residents to "take action now [and] remain safe and be aware of your local surroundings."</p>
      <p>Speaking earlier today before the latest warnings were issued, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> meteorologist Helen Willetts said: "It will be really very wet for the Balearic Islands as we go through Saturday.</p>

        <figcaption>The weekend will kickoff with a wet, disruptive situation</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"It will push into the United Kingdom and into France as well.</p>
      <p>"Large waves on the coast and more flooding rains are expected. The ground is already so saturated."</p>
      <p>It is thought that the heavy rain could then push into Scotland.</p>
      <p>In addition to the nine flood warnings issued by the Environment Agency, primarily in the South West and North East, there have been 77 less severe alerts.</p>

      <p>The warnings follow a month of severe flooding in parts of South Yorkshire and Derbyshire, which saw at least one fatality and the Government heavily criticised for "abandoning" people in the worst hit areas.</p>

      <p>Thousands were forced to flee their homes, while the Prime Minister was met with heckling when he visited towns in the worst-affected areas.</p>
      <p>Upon Boris Johnson's first visit - six days after the flooding began - Labour leader said "it would have been a very different story" had it happened in Surrey or the South East.</p>
      <p>And on Thursday evening, two people died in Gloucestershire when a tree fell on their car.</p>
