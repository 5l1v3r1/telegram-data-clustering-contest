      <p>PlayStation Plus - the paid subscription service that offers two PlayStation games at no additional cost each month - is being heavily discounted at a variety of retailers at the minute, thanks to Black Friday sales.</p>
      <p>While we're still a few days away from the savings truly kicking off, we're seeing more and more deals pop each day, and this one is a must for almost every PlayStation 4 owner out there. As well as a few extra games to add to your PS4 library, PlayStation Plus allows those who own Sony's hardware to play online multiplayer.</p>
      <p>The best price we can currently find is over at ShopTo, which is selling 12 months of PS Plus for £29.85; that's a saving of over £20. If that's out of stock while you're reading this, there's always Amazon and Game, too. Both stores are both flogging a year of PlayStation Plus for £37.49. Over at Argos, you can save yourself a couple of extra quid and pick it up for £34.99.</p>

      <p>And for the music lovers out there, Currys PC World is bundling 6 months of a premium Spotify subscription with the year of PS Plus for £37.49. So, don't worry if the first online shop you go to is sold out, because you have plenty of options at the minute.</p>
