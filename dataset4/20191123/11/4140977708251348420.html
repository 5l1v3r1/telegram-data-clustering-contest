                <p>Another Chelsea player in doubt to play the match against Manchester City is Callum Hudson-Odoi. The young England international has returned with a hamstring to add to Chelsea’s woes. Frank Lampard has issued an update regarding both of their chances to play at the Eithad vs Manchester City.</p>
                <h3>Will Christian Pulisic and Callum Hudson-Odoi play vs Man City today?</h3>
                <p>Frank Lampard answered questions regarding his Chelsea team and gave mixed news as he virtually ruled out one of the two players.</p>

                      <p><i>‘He didn’t go and we had full communications with the USA national team, their manager and medical team because I like to be really open and transparent with that,’</i> Lampard said of Pulisic in his pre-match press conference at Cobham.</p>
                      <p>
                        <i>‘I respect that they want their players but he had a problem going into the last game against Palace and he was struggling, hence why he came off after his goal. We had good communication and he missed the two games but he’s started to train again this midweek so he’s in contention to play.’</i>

                          <p><i>‘Everyone has come back healthy and well,’</i> Lampard continued. ‘<i>Callum is probably the one who has a hamstring issue picked up in the England game so he will struggle to be in contention for this game but we’re hoping it’s more short-term.’</i></p>

                            <p>The last time Chelsea travelled to the Etihad, they were thrashed 6-0. Frank Lampard will hope for a different result this time with the Blues coming out on top. A good result here will help them consolidate their top 4 position.</p>
                            <p>However, Manchester City, who are coming off a defeat to Liverpool, will want to bring their campaign back to track with a statement victory against one of the most exciting sides this season.</p>
