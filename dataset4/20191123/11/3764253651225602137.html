      <p>The House of Representatives on Thursday, November 22 directed its committee on banking and currency to summon the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Godwin Emefiele and the managing director of the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation, Umaru Ibrahim.</p>
      <p>The duo are expected to answer questions on the new status of Savannah Bank regarding its commencement of operations after its closure.</p>
      <p>Daily Trust reports that the committee was given four weeks to submit its findings and report back to the green chambers.</p>
      <p>The motion was moved by an All Progressives Congress member from <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/jigawa-state-news-today.html">Jigawa</a> state, Honourable Magaji Da'u Aliyu.</p>
      <p>The committee was also mandated to invite the bank’s shareholders and the new management to brief it on possible ways of refunding depositors and looking into the circumstances that led to the withdrawal of Savannah Bank’s licence and eventual closure in 2002.</p>
