      <p>NEW DELHI: Hundreds of students and activists sang, danced and chanted anti-government slogans in India’s capital on Saturday as they marched against increased student housing fees at a public university.<br/>During the protest in New Delhi, the students chanted slogans such as “Fight, fight, fight for your right to study” and “Keep fighting, keep dying.”<br/>The protest took a jovial turn from last week, when several students clashed with police, sustained injuries, and were detained and charged with destroying public property.<br/>The initial protests last week were mainly by students from Jawaharlal Nehru University, where a new hostel manual aims to increase rent for a single-bed room to more than $8 per month from less than $1 per month earlier. The security deposit more than doubled to more than $160.<br/>On Saturday, they were joined by activists, former students and left-wing political organizations who called for free education for all. Instead of clashing, some sang satirical songs about issues like cow protectionism and the government’s clampdown on dissent.<br/>Kriti Shukla, 30, a former student from a private school who joined the protesters, said education is the only way to bridge the class and income divide in India.<br/>“Education, unless made free, we cannot fight with any form of discrimination or poverty,” she said.<br/>The students said they won’t back down unless lawmakers intervene in Jawaharlal Nehru University’s decision to hike the fees.<br/>“We won’t let our spaces be hampered by these things,” said Mohammad Asif Khan, a postgraduate student at JNU. “We will reclaim our spaces back.”</p>
