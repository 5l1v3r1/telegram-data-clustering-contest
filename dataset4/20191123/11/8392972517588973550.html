      <p>Jenny Newby and best friend Lee Riley have always been a hugely popular pair after joining hit Channel 4 show <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/gogglebox/">Gogglebox</a> in 2014.</p>
      <p>But while viewers are big fans of the Hull friends, they don't seem to be too taken by Jenny's choice of TV snack.</p>
      <p>On last night's show, Jenny was happily tucking into a plate of Brussels sprouts, which also appeared to be completely raw.</p>
      <p>As she bit down on one, Lee turned to her and hilariously asked: "Are you taking the [bleep]?"</p>

      <p>"No, I love 'em. It's like eating cabbage," Jenny replied, to which Lee quipped, "Get stuffed. Not exactly coleslaw is it?"</p>
      <p>One stunned fan asked: "Jenny why are you eating Brussels sprouts like that?"</p>

      <p>A second shocked Gogglebox viewer remarked: "Sprouts! Seriously! They are little farts wrapped in cabbage leaves. Yak yak yak! Not mad, just disappointed in loving sprouts."</p>
      <p>Another also pointed out the potential health hazard of eating uncooked sprouts, sharing: "Jenny you can't eat them raw... full of bacteria."</p>

      <p>While you can actually eat them raw, you just need to make sure they're washed properly.</p>

      <p>And it wasn't just Jenny's sprouts that caught the attention of social media last night - <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/gogglebox/gogglebox-viewers-hysterics-dave-the-dog/">Dave the dog proved to be a huge hit with viewers</a>.</p>
      <p>The Malone family were watching the documentary series with their Rottweiler when the on-screen vet explained how he was going to artificially inseminate a dog that "wanted puppies".</p>

      <p>But while Tom, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/gogglebox/goggleboxs-julie-malone-weight-loss/">Julie</a>, Tom Jnr and Shaun watched open-mouthed as he collected a sample of semen from a male dog, Dave got right up close to the telly screen.</p>
      <p>He then raced back and laid on Tom's lap, with his legs in the air. Tom laughed: "Dave says can we get the address of that vets?! He likes the look of it!"</p>
      <p>After watching the scenes, one fan tweeted: "Dave the dog's reaction to watching Mountain Vets has to be the best #gogglebox clip ever."</p>
