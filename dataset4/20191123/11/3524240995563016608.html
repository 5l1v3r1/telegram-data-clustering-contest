      <p>Actor, Scott Roberts, has revealed that he sometimes gets weird messages from fans. In an interview with <i>Saturday Beats</i>, he said a fan once said she would love to kiss him.</p>
      <p>“I manage my female fans. Sometimes I act like I don’t see some of these messages they send to me, and if it’s not so annoying, I simply say ‘hello’.</p>
      <p>“A fan once sent me a message, saying, ‘I would love to kiss you’. Some of them say they would love to spend time with me. It makes me laugh.”</p>
      <p>Asked why he plays more of lover boy roles, Roberts said: “I don’t want to believe I have been typecast as a lover boy because there are a lot of movies I have appeared in that have nothing to with playing lover boy roles. We are all lover boys and lover girls.”</p>
      <p>Speaking further, he denied taking a break from acting.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t take a break from acting; I have been doing a lot of other things. I have a movie that just came out titled, ‘The Good’. Sola Sobowale, Alex Usifo and others starred in the movie.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the growth of Nollywood, the actor said, “The movie industry is actually better now. Between now and the next two years, we can actually be compared to Hollywood.”</p>
