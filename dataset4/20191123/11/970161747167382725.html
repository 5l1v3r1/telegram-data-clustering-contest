      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> has made three changes to the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> side ahead of his first match in charge against <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/west-ham-united-fc/">West Ham</a> and has left Christian Eriksen on the bench.</p>
      <p>Moussa Sissoko, as well as summer signings Giovani Lo Celso and Tanguy Ndombele, are also omitted from the Spurs starting XI with Eric Dier stepping into midfield alongside the recalled Harry Winks.</p>
      <p>Lucas Moura also returns, having started on the bench in the 1-1 draw against Sheffield United which turned out to be <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a>’s last match in charge, but there was no room for unsettle star Eriksen.</p>
      <p>The Denmark international’s contract is due to expire at the end of the season and he struggled to showcase his best form since admitting he wanted to leave the club in the summer.</p>

      <p>Mourinho’s former employers Manchester United are known to covet the former Ajax playmaker, while both Juventus and Real Madrid are said to be monitoring his situation.</p>

      <p>Ahead of Saturday’s eagerly awaited London derby, BT Sport commentator Darren Fletcher revealed the word coming from the Spurs camp was that Mourinho is still to determine ‘what is best for Tottenham’ and is ‘unsure’ as to what the future holds for Eriksen.</p>
      <p>Asked to explain Eriksen’s omission, Mourinho told BT:  ‘It’s not just about continuity, this match is very important but our future is very, very important and I need to understand really what is in Christian’s mind or heart, and we have to make the right decision for the club.</p>
      <p>‘On top of that I believe Lucas, Son, Alli and Kane are players with good understanding, trying to find the little time we’ve had to work to find the dynamic.</p>
      <p>‘I like the ideas but I like to work the ideas. Today is more about working the ideas, let’s see if we can find happiness.’</p>
