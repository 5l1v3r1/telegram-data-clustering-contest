      <p>A BBC radio host who made a joke about Princess Charlotte on the air reveals her parents asked to have a “talk” with him about what he’d said.</p>
      <p>Back in September, BBC Radio 1 host Greg James was discussing the princess’s first day of at the exclusive Thomas’s Battersea school, and commented on a photo of the youngster greeting her teacher with a handshake.</p>
      <p>“Who the hell shakes hands with their teacher on the first day?” quipped James.</p>

      <p>That remark came back to haunt him a few weeks later when the radio host accompanied BBC Radio 1’s Teen Heroes to meet Prince William and Duchess Kate at Kensington Palace.</p>
      <p>“They were listening on the morning Charlotte went to school,” James told <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/radio-1s-greg-james-told-20917937"><i>The Mirror</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“They said: ‘We were listening on the morning of little Charlotte’s first day, and we want to talk to you about the handshaking thing,’” James recalled. “I went: ‘Oh God, no!’”</p>

      <p>He continued: “They’d heard me saying this school was so posh they had to shake hands with their teacher every day. They were not like that in my day. You were pleased if you got a smile.”</p>
      <p>While James didn’t reveal precisely what the royal couple told him, he added: “I’m sure it’s all absolutely fine.”</p>
