      <h1>Man's mix-up telling work he's taking sick day leads to colleagues making shrine</h1>
      <h2>The email led to a shrine being created at his desk and a hashtag sending him prayers being used by thousands on Twitter</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:01:38+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:01</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>Calling in sick can always be a little daunting as you try to convey your illness over the phone to convince your boss of a genuine ailment.</p>
      <p>Sending an email is the easier option, giving you time to choose your words carefully and side-stepping any chance of sounding somewhat excited for your upcoming duvet day.</p>
      <p>When local TV reporter Nick Vasas felt a little under the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> yesterday, he decided to take the courtesy of emailing a few of his colleagues to let them know he wasn't going to be in.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Nick, he made a monumental blunder leading to a flood of concerned emails, a shrine being created and the hashtag #PrayersForNick being widely used on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> .</p>

      <p>Instead of telling the handful of colleagues who would be affected by his absence, the traffic reporter for Kansas City FOX4 accidentally emailed the thousands and thousands of employees of the entire company, made up of stations across the country, using the 'breaking news' contact list.</p>
      <p>Employees were then bombarded with 'reply all' responses with concerns for Nick as well-wishers sent their 'thoughts and prayers' from as far as Buffalo and Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>Many of the stations used the resources at their disposal to record messages in the news studios to spread the news of Nick's sick day.</p>
      <p>It appeared the only station which didn't receive the email was the one it was intended for, with one of Nick's managers tweeting: "Grateful to report he and I have communicated and he is going to pull through.</p>
      <p>"You guys are a scream. Funny enough, WE didn't get that email."</p>

      <p>Thousands of people began a hashtag to send their sympathies and his own station created a huge shrine at his desk, complete with candles, flowers and framed pictures of their struggling hero.</p>
      <p>Nick took it all in his stride, responding to the messages and thanking people for their thoughts as he recovered from minor oral surgery the day before.</p>
      <p>Not everyone saw the funny side, as the company issued an all-staff email to say: "I hate to be a party pooper and I have as much sympathy for Nick as anyone.</p>
      <p>"But with the number of members of the breaking news list there could be thousands of emails sent by the time this is done."</p>
      <p>The group was locked down to ensure it was only being used for big breaking news stories, which could be missed among the stream of get well messages.</p>
      <p>One replied: "They can take away our emails, but they can't take away our #PrayersForNick."</p>
      <p>Hang in there buddy, we're all with you.</p>
