      <h1>Hello, sun! Vancouver forecast calls for six days of sunshine</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:02:48+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/author/elisia-seeber/" target="_blank">Elisia Seeber</a></address>
      <p>Just when there was a glimmer of hope there would be a sprinkling of snow over the city next week, in true Vancouver style, the predictions changed.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/11/21/vancouver-weather-flurries/">Environment Canada forecast a chance of flurries</a> for the evening of Tuesday Nov. 26 but it’s now calling for clear skies and chilly overnight lows.</p>

      <p>On the bright side, the weather organization is predicting six days of a mix of sunshine and cloud for Vancouver.</p>
      <p>Saturday will be cloudy with periods of rain but the weekend will be brightened up come Sunday with a mix of sun and cloud throughout the day and a high of 10°C. The forecast also calls for wind in the morning.</p>
      <p>While the sun will be out the temperatures are forecast to drop, with daytime highs hovering between 10°C to 5°C throughout the week. By the end of the week Vancouver will see overnight lows of below 0°C, with Thursday night forecast to dip to a frosty -4°C.</p>

      <p>The City of Vancouver has already started opening additional shelter spaces for extremely cold weather conditions. Those in need of shelter can find updates on which locations have extra beds on the city’s <a href="https://vancouver.ca/people-programs/winter-response-shelter-strategy.aspx">Winter Response Strategy and temporary shelters page</a>.</p>
      <h3>B.C. Winter Forecast</h3>
      <p>Back in September, The Weather Network predicted that British Columbia <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/09/16/vancouver-weather-network-bc-fall/">would have a milder winter, but that December was a “wild card.”</a></p>
      <p>Since then, <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/11/18/vancouver-weather-winter-forecast-bc/">the winter forecast has been updated</a> to include the most recent prediction, which calls for milder temperatures along the B.C. coast and across much of Northern B.C. While northeastern B.C. to the southern interior will see near normal temperatures.</p>
      <p>While the north coast region is, “expected to see above average rainfall and alpine snow,” the south coast region is expected to be drier than normal. With this in mind, the forecast adds that this dry pattern may break at times during the season. During these breaks, the Lower Mainland could have the, “potential to see several weeks’ worth of precipitation in just 5 to 10 days.”</p>
