      <p>As Nicky Byrne, Mark Feehily, Shane Filan, Kian Egan and Ryan Tubridy all talked together, the pop stars, as well as the host of the Late Late reminisced about the legendary broadcaster and how Gay "was a special, special man."</p>
      <p>Ryan recalled how the lads made their debut on the Late Late Show in 1998, back when former host Gay Byrne was presenting one of his last show's.</p>
      <p>The current presenter shared a touching photo of the group posing with Gay which you can below.</p>

      <p>Ryan asked the lads what they remembered of back then and it was Shane Filan who responded.</p>
      <p>Filan said: "That performance was 21 years ago this week. It was our first time to ever perform on <i>The Late Late Show</i> - we kind of felt like 'Oh my God’ we’ve made it - we’re on the Late Late with Gay Byrne.</p>
      <p>"It was a huge deal. It’s something you look forward to your whole life."</p>

      <p>Nicky Byrne remembered a joke Gay made in reference to what they were wearing at the time.</p>
      <p>"We were wearing long coats and he said something like Dublin Corporation had lent us the coats for the night," Nicky laughed.</p>
      <p>"We grew up with him. He was a special, special man.</p>
      <p>"He had this famous saying 'Well you wanted to be in showbiz, now you're in showbiz!'"</p>
      <p>Mark Feehily, who recently welcomed a baby girl with his fiancé Cailean O'Neill, also admitted the late broadcaster was quite supportive when he came out as gay that year.</p>
      <p>He recalled: "The one standout moment for me was when we did a TV special at Christmas time. I really wasn't expecting it but he brought up the coming out issue, and said it's fantastic how you can be who you want to be, and be yourself in this country and everyone supports you.</p>
      <p>"I don’t know why, but I didn’t expect him to bring it up, but it was really lovely for him to acknowledge it for me.</p>
      <p>"He was like the grandad of Ireland and so he spoke for a certain generation.</p>
      <p>"It was very nice. He didn’t have to bring it up but it’s like he wanted to, and he wanted to show that he was very supportive."</p>
