      <h1>TV Reporter Goes Viral After Sending Sick Day Request to Thousands</h1>
      <h2>Fox 4 traffic reporter Nick Vasos was gifted with well wishes, jokes and the hashtag #prayersfornick</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:28:48+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/rosemary-rossi/" target="_blank">Rosemary Rossi</a></address>
      <p>A sick day for Kansas City, Missouri, traffic reporter Nick Vasos took over the internet Thursday when an email announcing he wasn’t feeling well wasn’t just sent to his supervisor at Fox 4, but was also accidentally sent to all 4500+ Nexstar Media Group employees in nearly 200 stations across the country.</p>
      <p>What resulted was a huge email chain from his colleagues — both wishing him well and serving up some lighthearted ribbing — and the Twitter hashtag #prayersfornick.</p>
      <p>“I am one of @NickVasos’ managers,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Jayhawk96/status/1197704493158273025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1197704493158273025&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ffox4kc.com%2F2019%2F11%2F22%2Fnick-vasos-sends-email-to-say-hes-sick-ends-up-emailing-the-entire-company%2F">wrote Jana Calkins</a>, an assistant news director at Fox 4. “Grateful to report he and I have communicated and he is going to pull through. You guys are a scream!”</p>

      <p>“And to think earlier this week, he was so happy to try Casey’s pizza. I long for the simple days,” joked <a href="https://twitter.com/AbbyEden/status/1197813357111382016">Abby Eden</a>, who is an anchor at Fox 4 Kansas City, where Vasos also works. “#PrayersForNick (for the record- he just called in sick. He’s ok.).”</p>
      <p>Eden took it a step further, sharing a photo on Twitter of a mock memorial set up at the studio in his honor, complete with candles, flowers, framed photos of him and small American flags.</p>

      <p>Vasos told one of his colleagues at Fox 4 that he had gotten lightheaded after fasting to prepare for oral surgery. He said he sent a text to his manager to tell her he wasn’t feeling well and wouldn’t be in on Friday, and when she didn’t respond, he turned to email.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think I realized that I was sending it to all of Nexstar, and I hit ‘send,'” Vasos said. “And that’s where we are today.”</p>
      <p>After thanks the scores of well-wishers, Vasos offered an apology to fellow “Nicks.”</p>

          <figcaption><b>April Ryan</b><br/>White House correspondent April Ryan has found herself the target of the Donald Trump administration several times, but most recently when Press Secretary Sean Spicer told her to "stop shaking your head" at the daily press briefing last week. Back in February, Ryan was in the news after an exchange with Trump, when she asked if the president would meet with the Congressional Black Caucus and was asked by the president to set up a meeting.<cite>April Ryan</cite></figcaption>

When she later clarified that all she had was a two-page form from 2005 and then spent 20 minutes dragging out the reveal on her show, some were quick to turn and accuse the MSNBC anchor of trying to goose her ratings.<cite>MSNBC</cite></figcaption>
