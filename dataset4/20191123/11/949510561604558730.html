      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Michael Bloomberg will not accept political donations if he runs for president and he will not take a salary if he wins.</p>
      <p>That’s according to senior aides who offered new details Saturday about the New York billionaire Democrat’s plans to navigate his wealth as a formal 2020 announcement appears imminent.</p>
      <p>Senior adviser Howard Wolfson said Bloomberg “cannot be bought.” He added that Bloomberg “has never taken a political contribution in his life. He is not about to start.”</p>
      <p>Bloomberg created a presidential campaign committee this week that has already reserved more than $30 million in television ads to begin running Sunday across several primary states.</p>
      <p>The moves, just 10 weeks before primary voting begins, reflect his concern that the current Democratic field is not well-positioned to defeat President Donald Trump.</p>
