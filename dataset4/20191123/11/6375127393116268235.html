      <h3>COMMUNICATIONS Secretary Martin Andanar yesterday expressed hope that the Quezon City court handling the Maguindanao massacre case will rule in favor of the 58 victims and their families after “ten years of delayed justice.”</h3>
      <p>“Ten years of delayed justice is intolerable and ignominious. We are hopeful that the law will prevail and the court will rule in favor of the victims’ families putting an end to the injustice they have had to endure for years, as the decision on the case will be out soon,” Andanar said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The 2009 massacre was “one of the deadliest attacks on journalists and the worst cases of election-related violence,” which killed 58 individuals, including 32 media members.</p>
      <p>Though a decision was supposed to have been given on Friday, Judge Jocelyn Solis-Reyes requested an extension. She was given until December 20 by the Supreme Court to make a judgment on the multiple murder case.</p>
      <p>Andanar further promised that the administration and the Presidential Task Force on Media Security will do their duty to prevent brutal killings or not allow them to go unpunished.</p>
      <p>“We will work to prevent and put an end to attacks on journalists, who are simply fulfilling their obligations to disseminate truth and information to the public. In cases where they are harmed or killed, we will aim to deliver swift justice and make the perpetrators answer to the law,” he said.</p>
