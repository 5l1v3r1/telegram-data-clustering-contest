      <h1>Indian-origin man convicted of raping woman in New York</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:13:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>An Indian-origin man has been convicted of raping a woman, after helping her find a place to live in the Queens neighbourhood here.</p>
      <p>Ashok Singh, 58, of Pennsylvania, was found guilty of rape and unlawful imprisonment following a two-week-long trial. He will be sentenced next month and faces up to 25 years in prison, Acting Queens District Attorney John Ryan said.</p>
      <p>According to trial testimony, in December 2015, Singh met the victim, who was looking for a rental apartment and offered to help her find a place to stay.</p>
      <p>Four days later, Singh called the woman and told her he had found a place and that she needed to move in immediately. Singh helped the then-40-year-old woman move in. Later, he also went grocery shopping for food and wine and returned to the basement apartment in Queens.</p>
      <p>The victim refused to drink alcohol with Singh and he went into a rage. He threw her on the bed and raped her. When he fell asleep, the victim ran out of the apartment and contacted a friend for help, the Queens District Attorney’s office said.</p>
      <p>The police were notified and the victim was treated at an area hospital. While the victim was at the hospital, Singh called her and left a voicemail message on her cell phone. He said he was sorry and he would never do it again without her permission.</p>
      <p>Singh's DNA was a match to vaginal swabs taken from the victim at the hospital during a sexual assault evidence collection exam.</p>
      <p>Ryan said the victim trusted Singh when he offered to help her find a place to live.</p>
      <p>"Sadly, she had no idea he was a predator. The defendant raped the victim...He will now be incarcerated as punishment for this heinous crime." </p>
