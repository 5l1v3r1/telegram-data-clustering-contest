      <p>It's raining awards for Esha Deol Takhtani. Early this year the Dhoom girl made her comeback with Cakewalk, a short Hindi feature film directed by Ram Kamal Mukherjee. After winning almost 11 international awards and getting selected at more than 26 national and international festivals, Esha is now running away with a few honours back home too. "It feels nice when your work is recognized. And that too after you are a mother of two beautiful daughters," says Esha, who recently bagged the prestigious Best Actress Award at MTVIWMBUZZ Digital Awards and Society Iconic Indian Award in Mumbai. </p>
      <p>Incidentally Esha's father Dharmendra never wanted his daughter to enter film industry. In fact, in Hema Malini's biography Beyond The Dream Girl, Esha had revealed that Dharmendra had stopped talking to her for almost six months when she made her debut in Bollywood (with Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe in 2002). So when after 17 years Dharmendra took to social media and congratulated Esha for her performance in Cakewalk, she felt it was extremely special. </p>

      <p>Esha now says,"Papa wished me for the first time for my work, and he had never seen any of my films. I guess Cakewalk is the first film of mine which Papa watched and loved. For a daughter, her father's wish and blessings will always be the biggest award."<br/><br/>Mom Hema Malini had also taken to social media to congratulate Esha. "My mom has encouraged me in all my endeavors. She is my constant force of energy and whatever I am today, is because of her love and guidance," Esha adds.</p>

      <p>Cakewalk has won many awards, apart from Best Short Film, Most Popular Short Film and Best Director Award in India and abroad. "Even I have won several other awards and certificates from various festivals across the globe for this film. Unfortunately, I couldn't receive them personally because I was expecting Miraya and I already had little Radhya to take care. But I have treasured each and every trophy and certificate from this film," Esha concludes.</p>

      <p>Cakewalk went on to become India's first film to be invited at BBC Studios in London. Is Mukherjee thinking about a sequel with Esha?<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- pinterest</i></p>
