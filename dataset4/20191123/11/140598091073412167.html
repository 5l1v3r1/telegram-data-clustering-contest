      <h1>Porcini mushroom risotto recipe </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/angela-hartnett/" target="_blank">Angela Hartnett</a></address>
      <p>This sustaining supper requires very little preparation; simply soak the porcini mushrooms and start cooking. It's perfect for a midweek meal or satisfying weekend supper. </p>
      <p>Risotto shouldn’t be too solid. It shouldn’t be like a soup, but it should pour easily. Adding one ladleful of stock at a time and allowing it to absorb is the best way. It’s critical not to overcook it, and essential to use a great home-made stock.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>5 minutes | <b>Cooking time: </b>25 minutes </p>
      <h3>SERVES </h3>
      <p>four to six</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>A few knobs of butter for cooking, plus 75g cold butter, diced</li>
        <li>1 large shallot, finely chopped to make about 2 tbsp</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
        <li>350g risotto rice</li>
        <li>50g dried porcini mushrooms (the lighter in colour the better), soaked in hot water to rehydrate</li>
        <li>1 litre hot light chicken stock</li>
        <li>Handful of chopped flat leaf parsley</li>
        <li>Grated parmesan, added to taste</li>
        <li>Handful of sautéed ceps, to finish</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD </h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Heat the oil and butter in a large heavy-bottomed pan. Add the shallot and garlic and cook for five minutes, or until the shallot is cooked and soft without any colour.</li>
        <li>Add another couple of knobs of butter along with the risotto rice and toast it in the bubbling butter for a few minutes. Drain and chop the soaked porcini and add to the rice.</li>
        <li>Start to add the hot chicken stock a ladleful at a time, adding the next lot only when it has cooked away in the pan. Cook for 16 to 18 minutes in total, until the rice is tender with a bite.</li>
        <li> Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cold diced butter and parmesan to taste. The risotto should be loose and pourable – add more butter if necessary and check the seasoning.</li>
        <li>Finish with the chopped parsley and some sautéed ceps.</li>
      </ul>
