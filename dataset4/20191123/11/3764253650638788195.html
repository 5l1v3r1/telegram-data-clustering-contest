      <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has expressed shock over the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham as he welcomed his old rival Mourinho back to Premier League.</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino was recently sacked at Tottenham after poor run of form this season in the Premier League and was replaced with Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho was also last year December fired at Manchester United after his side's Premier League defeat against Liverpool.</p>
      <p>The former Chelsea manager has however been out of job since then before getting Tottenham position although he was doing some punditry work.</p>

      <p><i>“I think you know him better than me, he’s had many years here.So welcome back, he’s an incredible manager and I’m pretty sure he’ll do a good job,''</i> Guardiola explained according to UK Sun.</p>
      <p>Last season, Pep Guardiola's Champions League dream was ended by Tottenham in which Pochettino led his wards to the final.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“I’m a little surprised, he’s done incredible, all the managers are judged on titles but it’s not the truth.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“That happened at Tottenham but the decisions are made and there’s nothing else to say,'' </i>Guardiola explained.</p>
      <p>Earlier, <b>Legit.ng</b> had reported how former Chelsea and Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277255-jose-mourinho-appointed-tottenham-hotspur-manager-10-months-losing-man-united-job.html">was appointed new Tottenham Hotspur manager</a> until the summer of 2023.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese tactician takes over from Argentine handler Mauricio Pochettino, who was shown the exit doors earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has been without a job after being fired by the Red Devils almost a year ago after too many issues with players and the club chiefs.</p>
