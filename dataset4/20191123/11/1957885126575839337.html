      <h1>Hunting for story clues in Netflix's The Witcher episode titles</h1>
      <h2>And there's a cool Easter egg in there.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:37:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:37</time> by <a rel="author">Wesley Yin-Poole</a></address>
      <p>Netflix has revealed the episode titles for The Witcher, among other teases.</p>
      <p>The Henry Cavill-starring show is set to launch its first season on Netflix, and ahead of time, Netflix took to Twitter to reveal the titles of the first eight episodes.</p>
      <p>Alongside each title is a brief description and a gif of its logo, and it's the descriptions that give us an idea of the events and themes the show will touch on.</p>
      <p>So, what can we expect? Well, the first episode, titled The End's Beginning, carries the following description: "A monster slain, a butcher named." This suggests the show will touch on Geralt's The Butcher of Blaviken origins.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Episode two, titled Four Masks, carries the description: "We look at a sorceress's early days." That surely means we'll get Yennefer's backstory. Episode three, titled Betrayer Moon, has a bestial footprint as its logo. Werewolf gubbins, perhaps?</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Episode four, Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials, includes the description: "The Law of Surprise is how one repays." The Law of Surprise is an old custom that dictates that a man saved by another is expected to offer a boon as payment, usually the saved man's firstborn child. Episode five, Bottled Appetites, has the description: "A fateful meeting, a bard is maimed." Surely the bard is Dandelion.</p>

      <p>And of course there's a dragon. Does the dragon burn the kingdom? If it does, perhaps we get a flashback to a time before it was in flames.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>And finally, episode eight is called Much More. "The Witcher Family, as you all like to say," is the description. This season finale surely sees Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri get together in some way.</p>

      <p>There's a nice little Easter egg in all this, too. If you combine all of the descriptions you get a nifty poem:</p>
      <p>
        <i>A monster slain, a butcher named</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>We look at a sorceress's earlier days</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>A picky eater, a family shamed</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The Law of Surprise is how one repays</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>A fateful meeting, a bard is maimed</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The hunt for a dragon is underway</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>A return to before a kingdom is flamed</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The Witcher Family as you all like to say</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Witcher hits Netflix just in time for Christmas, on 20th December. A second season is already confirmed.</p>
