      <h3>PORAC, Pampanga – The Bureau of Customs - Port of Clark yesterday  destroyed multi-million pesos worth of cigarette manufacturing machines and 145 cases of fake cigarettes as part of its campaign against illicit trade and customs fraud.</h3>
      <p>District collector Ruby Alameda of the BOC-Clark said the two machines and fake cigarettes came from the BoC warehouse in Bulacan and were subjected to crushing and incineration after receiving a go-signal from the Customs national office.</p>
      <p>Alameda said bogus Bureau of Internal Revenue stamps were also burned.</p>
      <p>She said the machines and fake cigarettes and stamps were seized last year from illegal manufacturers.</p>
      <p>“These machines were used to manufacture fake cigarettes in violation of existing laws. Charges, including use of fake BIR stamps and violation of the Intellectual Property Rights law, have been recommended to be filed against the owner of the machines and the fake tobacco products,” the BoC-Clark district collector said.</p>
      <p>Alameda said the destruction of the machines and fake cigarettes in this town should send a strong message to others to stop their illegal business practices and in shortchanging the government of its rightful revenues.</p>
      <p>The crushing and incineration event, which was conducted by the Digama Waste Management Services in this municipality, was attended by representatives from the National Tobacco Corp., Commission on Audit, BIR, Japan Tobacco Inc. and Philip Morris Fortune Tobacco Corp.</p>
      <p>Last November 19, seven units of cigarette making machines, a plastic recycling machine, a manual lifter, a generator set and a generator cooling system were also destroyed by the BOC-Clark by crushing them with a backhoe.</p>
