      <p>Celtic boss Neil Lennon has rubbished talk of his club being told they can have Southampton winger Mohamed Elyounoussi on a permanent basis if they meet a £10 million transfer valuation.

      </p>
      <p>Steven Gerrard insists there is no new contract in the offing for Glen Kamara despite reports to the contrary.

      <p>Christophe Berra remembers far more unsettling Hearts times than the current uncertainty while the club seek a new manager and sporting director. He experienced coaches disappearing to Lithuania with stress and wages not being paid under former owner Vladimir Romanov. This is a walk in the Tynecastle park by comparison. <a href="https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/sport/football/hearts/latest-hearts-news/christophe-berra-hearts-have-had-worse-times-so-let-ann-budge-take-time-find-new-manager-1320120"><b>(Evening News)</b></a></p>

      <p>Neil Lennon welcomes back a "happy" Leigh Griffiths to the Celtic squad for the visit of Livingston on Saturday.
