      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/pmco-fall-split-south-asia-2019-finals">PMCO Fall Split 2019</a> Prelims for Global Finals are being held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The 3rd match of Prelims Day 1 took place in the map Miramar, from a third-person perspective. The flight path for this match started from the south-east part of the map and went towards the south-west part of the map. The first play-zone formed near the north side of the map, and it circled hot-priority locations such as Graveyard, El Azhar, Junkyard and Water Treatment.</p>

      <p>Since the zone formed on the north, everyone was more focused on getting inside the zone. This resulted in a very passive early game from all the teams on the map. Red’s Levi took down SaTan from Swat69 to secure the first kill of the game. Bigetron eliminated four members of SynerGE after a very aggressive flank from their side. Mega Esports couldn’t achieve the hattrick of Chicken Dinner as they were eliminated by Futbolist, and had to settle for 10th position. GoSkilla, Orange Esports, and Asterion made it to the final circle of the game. However, with a two-man advantage on both Asterion and Orange Esports, GoSkillawas able to successfully close the game, winning their first Chicken Dinner of the tournament.</p>
