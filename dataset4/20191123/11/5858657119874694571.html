      <p>“I am not asking to make up for 16 years of underfunding and our inability to bargain overnight,” she explains. “The bargaining table needs to be funded, that’s why we’re here having conversations with delegates to really raise awareness about the issues.”</p>
      <p>But Mooring says that does mean more money.</p>

      <p>Meantime, Premier John Horgan says he’s confident there is a solution as there’s so much common ground.</p>
      <p>“What we have is a dispute between parties in a collective bargaining negotiations. It’s not a dispute about values, it’s not a dispute about our passion – our equal passion – for education it’s a labour negotiation,” he says. “The contract the teachers took all the way to the Supreme Court is one they signed with the NDP.”</p>

      <p>Mooring says they need to see movement in those negotiations and more money long before next year’s budget.</p>
