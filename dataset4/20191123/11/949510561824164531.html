      <h1>Survivors fear smaller payouts from PG&amp;E with each fire</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:14:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:14</time> by <a rel="author">Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>Recent wildfires have scorched communities in California, leaving a new group of victims filing claims against a utility that is already under bankruptcy protection.</p>
      <p>More than 70,000 wildfire survivors have filed claims against Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, the utility whose equipment has been blamed for sparking deadly blazes.</p>
      <p>As the count of homes destroyed ticks up, some fear their chance for a payout from the bankrupt utility is dwindling.</p>
      <p>In its bankruptcy plan, PG&amp;E has pledged to pay $8.4 billion to wildfire victims. A competing proposal made by bondholders seeking to gain control of PG&amp;E would pay wildfire victims $13.5 billion.</p>
      <p>Continued fires threaten those plans because both proposals give financial backers an out under certain conditions. For example, if PG&amp;E-sparked fires burn down 500 houses this year, the backers of those plans can withdraw.</p>
