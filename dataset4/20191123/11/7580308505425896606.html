      <h1>Kenya landslides kill a dozen people</h1>

      <p>At least 12 people were killed in Kenya when their homes were swept away in a landslide during ferocious rainstorms, local government officials said Saturday.</p>
      <p>Their homes were hit overnight Friday amid torrential rains in Kenya’s West Pokot region, 350 kilometres (220 miles) northwest of the capital Nairobi.</p>
      <p>“Twelve bodies have been recovered, and a search for more is going on,” West Pokot County Commissioner Apollo Okello told journalists on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“The challenge we are facing is the heavy rains, but we are trying our best.”</p>
      <p>Okello said that two children were pulled out alive from the smashed wreckage of their mud-covered homes.</p>
      <p>“They have been rushed to hospital,” he said.</p>
      <p>Rescue efforts have been delayed because roads have been cut and bridges closed after streams turned into raging torrents.</p>
      <p>“Massive landslides reported in various areas of West Pokot County following a heavy downpour,” Kenya Red Cross said in a message, adding that it’s emergency response teams had deployed to help.</p>
      <p>But police officers on the ground said they feared the toll could rise. Rescue efforts to dig bodies out of the dirt continued.</p>
      <p>It is not only Kenya that is affected. The landslides come amid weeks of destructive rains and flooding across East Africa.</p>
      <p>Violent downpours have displaced tens of thousands in Somalia, submerged whole towns in South Sudan and killed dozens in flash floods and landslides in Ethiopia and Tanzania too.</p>
      <p>Close to a million people in South Sudan alone are affected by growing fears of disease and starvation.</p>
      <p>Floods hit East Africa regularly, but scientists say that it has been exacerbated by a powerful climate phenomenon in the Indian Ocean stronger than any seen in years.</p>
      <p>The extreme weather is blamed on the Indian Ocean Dipole — a climate system defined by the difference in sea surface temperature between western and eastern areas of the ocean.</p>
      <p>The ocean off East Africa is currently far warmer than usual, resulting in higher evaporation resulting in the rain over the continent.</p>
