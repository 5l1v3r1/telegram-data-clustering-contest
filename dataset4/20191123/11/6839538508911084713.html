      <p>A teenager has been charged with drug trafficking during schoolies’ celebrations at Victor Harbor.</p>
      <p>Police allegedly discovered 34 ecstasy pills, cannabis and a set of scales in a backpack in the back of the car at 6.30pm yesterday. He was bailed to appear in court on January 6 next year.</p>
      <p>Police have handed out almost 30 fines, with 27 expiation notices for various offences, including drinking in a dry zone, urinating in public and disorderly behaviour.</p>
      <p>One police barring order was also issued. Seven people were taken to hospital.</p>
      <p>A Wynn Vale teenager, 17, was arrested just after 9pm on Friday for allegedly acting disorderly and damaging property.</p>
      <p>However, Superintendent Mark Fairney said there were no major incidents during the evening.</p>
      <p>“Police are pleased with the behaviour of schoolies so far,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s great to see so many schoolies have taken advice from parents and police to be responsible and enjoy themselves.”</p>
