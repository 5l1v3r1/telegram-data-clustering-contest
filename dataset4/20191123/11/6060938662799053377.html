      <h1>Taijul Islam stunner removes centurion Virat Kohli in Day-Night Test</h1>

      <p>KOLKATA: Bangladesh concussion substitute <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Taijul-Islam">Taijul Islam</a> Saturday sent back India skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> for 136 with a stunning outfield catch on day two of the first day-night Test for both teams.</p>
      <p>Taijul returned to the XI along with Mehidy Hasan as substitutes for Nayeem Hasan and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Liton-Das">Liton Das</a>, both of whom pulled out due to concussion fears after being hit on the helmet in India's pink ball debut in Kolkata.</p>
      <p>Taijul, a left-arm spinner, made it count with a wicket of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ajinkya-Rahane">Ajinkya Rahane</a> for 51 and then played a big hand in Kohli's prized wicket off paceman Ebadat Hossain.</p>

      <p>Kohli, who completed his 27th Test century in the first session, flicked a sliding leg-side delivery from Ebadat to be caught by a diving Taijul at fine leg.</p>
      <p>Taijul seemed to have misjudged the ball before he leapt to his right and remained airborne while taking the catch with both hands.</p>
      <p>It was Ebadat's third delivery with the second new ball that Bangladesh took in the 81st over.</p>
      <p>A disbelieving Kohli returned to a standing ovation from the packed crowd at <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Eden-Gardens">Eden Gardens</a> that remains sold out for the first four days of the spectacle.</p>
