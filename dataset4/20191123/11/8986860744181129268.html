      <p>A new video of the former manager of Stonebwoy, Blakk Cedi, and Kelvyn Boy who is also a former signee of Stonebwoy together with other guys throwing jabs at Stonebwoy in a new video has surfaced on the internet.</p>
      <p>In the video which is fast going viral, Blakk Cedi and his new artists, Kelvyn Boy are having a good time together with their friends while singing Kelvyn Boy’s diss song to Stonebwoy.</p>

      <p>Basically, the song talks about Stonebwoy being disgraced after he sacked them from Bhim Nation and the fact that they are moving higher in life now.</p>
      <p>Blakk Cedi stayed at the back of the crowd as they sang along to the song which was basically meant to mock Stonebwoy.</p>

      <p>Although Stonebwoy claims he has upgraded Blakk Cedi from a manager to an agent, it feels more like he has been downloaded and subsequently sacked from the Bhim camp.</p>
      <p>Whiles Stonebwoy and Kelvyn Boy have publicly jabbed each other, Blakk Cedi has been silent throughout the turmoil.</p>

      <p>Ghanaians do not know exactly how Blakk Cedi pissed off Stonebwoy except the rumors that he sabotaged him by signing Kelvy Boy to his label.</p>
