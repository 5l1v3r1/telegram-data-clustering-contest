      <h1>Panettone bread and butter pudding recipe </h1>

      <p>About three quarters of a 1kg panettone will easily fill a 30cm  x  18cm baking dish (or equivalent). Serve this with cold, thick cream – anything else would be too sweet. A glass of vin santo would also go very well. It is delicious cold, but can be warmed successfully in the microwave.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>15 minutes, plus standing time  | <b>Cooking time: </b>45 minutes </p>
      <h3>SERVES </h3>
      <p>six to eight</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Butter, for greasing</li>
        <li>750g-1kg panettone, or leftovers coming to a similar amount</li>
        <li>2 eggs, plus 2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>200g caster sugar</li>
        <li>500ml milk (I use whole milk)</li>
        <li>500ml double cream</li>
      </ul>
      <p>METHOD </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Take a 30cm  x  18cm baking dish and rub all over the inside with butter.</li>
        <li>If using a whole panettone, cut it from top to bottom into four equal pieces.</li>
        <li> Take a quarter of the panettone and cut into 2.5cm slices. Repeat with the other quarters – you’ll find you probably need only three to fill the dish. Alternatively, slice your leftovers into a similar thickness.</li>
        <li>Layer the baking tin with the panettone slices, allowing them to overlap just as you would a normal bread and butter pudding. Have the crusts sticking out so they get nicely baked and brown.</li>
        <li>To make the custard, whisk together the eggs, yolks and sugar until the sugar has been dissolved. Gradually add the milk and cream until all is incorporated. Leave this to stand for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour the custard all over the panettone. Don’t be put off by the amount of custard you need – if necessary, leave some to soak into the bread and then add more. Leave the pudding to stand for at least 30 minutes to absorb the liquid.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 160C/140C fan/Gas 3.</li>
        <li>Bake the panettone for about 40 minutes. The whole pudding should wobble when it comes out of the oven but not be raw. If it is, just cook for another five minutes and check again.</li>
        <li>Leave the pudding to sit for 30 minutes before serving with thick cream.</li>
      </ol>
