      <p>The inauguration of Argentina's <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/argentinas-president-elect-vows-to-make-good-on-debt-without-austerity-measures-263268">president-elect Alberto Fernandez</a> next month has reignited a debate over the legalization of abortion, a year after conservatives narrowly blocked its decriminalization, leaving the country bitterly divided over the issue.</p>
      <p>Fernandez, a leftist Peronist, pledged last week he would move to legalize abortion as soon as the new government takes over on December 10.</p>
      <p>"I am an activist for an end to the criminalization of abortion," Fernandez, 60, said in an interview, adding that he would send a bill to Congress. </p>
      <p>However, he did not say whether he would seek to decriminalize abortion or legalize it as demanded by <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/abortion-effectively-decriminalised-in-australia-as-new-south-wales-passes-new-bill-252101">feminist movements</a>.</p>
      <p>Fernandez already appears to have nailed his colors firmly to the mast on the issue. He recently attended the launch of "We are Belen" a book telling the story of a young woman who ran afoul of Argentina's strict anti-abortion laws. </p>
      <p>After suffering a miscarriage, Belen was jailed for 29 months for an abortion, before eventually being acquitted by a court.</p>
      <p>In a foreword for the book, Canadian author Margaret Atwood said Argentina "provided some of the real-life practices that I included in The Handmaid's Tale, especially the theft of babies perpetrated during the military dictatorship."</p>
      <p>"How many other Belens are there in the world? How many women have died because they were afraid of going to a hospital because of an abortion, spontaneous or provoked, terrified of the possibility of being accused of murder?"</p>
      <p>At the book launch in Buenos Aires, Fernandez posed for pictures with pro-abortion activists and their emblematic green scarves, a clear gesture of support.</p>
      <p>Last year, a bill to decriminalize abortion up to the 14th week of pregnancy was narrowly adopted by the Chamber of Deputies but defeated in the Senate, under strong pressure from the still-powerful Catholic Church.</p>
      <p>Argentina novelist and activist Claudia Pineiro, said "abortion is back at the center of debate because Alberto Fernandez is disposed to legalizing it."</p>
      <p>"I think he has to decriminalize it and legalize it, but to do that he has to proceed in stages: maybe he should first consider decriminalization and then legalization." </p>
      <p>"You can't go fight with all your guns blazing at once, because there are very powerful forces lined up on the other side."</p>
      <p>In Pope Francis's homeland, <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/gay-marriage-abortion-laws-liberalised-in-northern-ireland-257395">abortion</a> is punishable by up to four years in prison, and allowable only in cases of rape or if there is a risk to the life of the mother.</p>
      <p>Fernandez taking a position has irked conservatives, like the Archbishop of La Plata, Victor Manuel Fernandez.</p>
      <p>"If I could talk to Alberto, I would ask him if it's worth starting his mandate off with an issue that has been so divisive for Argentinians," the archbishop wrote in an open letter.</p>
      <p>Fernandez's abortion plan is "unfortunate," said Ruben Proietti, head of the Christian Alliance of Evangelical Churches in Argentina, ACIERA. </p>
      <p>Proietti last year helped mobilize half a million people onto the streets to counter the feminist pro-abortion lobby as both sides held rival mass protests. The pro-abortion activists wore green scarves to symbolize their cause, and the anti-abortion groups wore baby blue.</p>
      <p>Proietti promised to bring "even more than before" onto the streets if Fernandez follows through on his plan.</p>
      <p>Feminist groups, which have grown in power in Argentina over the past year, say they will not give up the fight.</p>
      <p>"The strategy is to continue to put pressure, to continue the campaign," said Martha Rosenberg, a leader of the pro-abortion movement in Argentina.</p>
      <p>"We have work to do," she said.</p>
      <p>According to NGOs, between 370,000 and 520,000 clandestine abortions are performed every year, more than 1,200 a day.</p>
      <p>Kena is one of the many women who were left "on the verge of death" after having a clandestine abortion.</p>
      <p>"I am poor and I have six children. I couldn't have a seventh," she told AFP on condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>"My partner told me feeding seven is the same as feeding six, and I told him, no, there won't be seventh eating."</p>
      <p>Although she had the abortion more than 20 years ago, it left her "suffering a lot". </p>
      <p>"I want abortion to be legal. I saved myself, but there are thousands of women who don't save themselves."</p>
      <p>According to the latest survey on beliefs and attitudes in Argentina, the number of people who believe abortion is a woman's right has doubled from 14.1 per cent in 2008 to 27.3 per cent in 2019.</p>
