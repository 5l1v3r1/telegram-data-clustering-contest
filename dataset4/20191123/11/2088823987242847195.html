      <p>David DiPietro ranks as no mere observer of the donnybrook among Republicans looking to succeed Chris Collins in the 27th Congressional District.</p>
      <p>The Republican assemblyman and former East Aurora mayor may understand the district’s deep red politics as well as anyone. He quietly wears his solid conservative credentials; no need to shout like the contenders now trying to “out-conservative” each other.</p>
      <p>They, after all, are vying for the nod of the district’s county leaders – an electorate of eight – who will determine a special election candidate.</p>
      <p>For DiPietro, requirements to gain the Republican nomination boil down to one.</p>
      <p>“It will be someone who helps the president and stands by him,” he said.</p>
      <p>As much as any issue, President Trump will dominate the special election which Gov. Andrew Cuomo hints will occur on April 28. Amherst pollster Barry Zeplowitz determined last summer that 81% of the district’s Republicans support the president.</p>
      <p>Now it’s apparent that NY-27’s Republican hopefuls must very much mimic Trump defenders like Rep. Elise Stefanik of Saratoga County during last week’s impeachment inquiry hearings. Unquestioned loyalty to the president, no matter what is revealed.</p>
      <p>DiPietro knows something about Trump. He and his friend – the late Assemblyman Bill Nojay of Monroe County – hatched the idea of Trump running for governor of New York back in 2013. After leaving an event at Lucarelli’s Banquet Center in Lackawanna, they were sitting on a car hood when the 2 a.m. inspiration hit.</p>
      <p>Others like Carl Paladino, the 2010 GOP candidate for governor, got involved. So did East Aurora political consultant Michael Caputo, as did Nick Langworthy, now the new state GOP chairman.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got five minutes,” Trump told them in a subsequent Trump Tower meeting arranged by consultant Roger Stone (who made his own news this month when convicted of seven felony counts).</p>
      <p>Five minutes turned into four hours. The future president was intrigued, explored the idea for a while, but it never happened. Still, it all started a process.</p>
      <p>Following Collins’ conviction on insider trading charges, DiPietro could probably have secured the special election nomination – or at least a primary victory – had he wanted. His district lies entirely within NY-27, and he is close to the powers that be.</p>
      <p>“I don’t like Albany but I enjoy helping people and fighting the fight,” he said, explaining his decision not to run for Congress. “Washington is not a passion for me.”</p>
      <p>Now the assemblyman remains neutral in the intramural fight.</p>
      <p>“I told each of them I will help in any way I can,” he said, explaining he would not endorse only to see his choice lose the special election nomination or the ensuing primary in June. That may summarize as well as anything the competitiveness of the 27th situation.</p>
      <p>As the picture becomes clearer in coming weeks, it’s a sure bet that Republicans throughout the district’s eight counties will turn to DiPietro. They will seek his counsel and eventually, his blessing.</p>
      <p>Nobody reads the district’s red turf better.</p>
      <p>• • •</p>
      <p>A few errant typing fingers composing last week’s Politics Column incorrectly reported the party affiliation of former County Executive Joel Giambra, who remains very much a Republican.</p>
      <p>That matters since Giambra’s name continues to enter discussions about the 60th Senate District to be vacated by Republican Chris Jacobs, who seeks the Collins seat in Congress. Giambra retains about $93,000 in his old county executive account, boasts major name recognition (some good, some bad), and has demonstrated the ability to win as a Republican in Democratic turf.</p>
      <p>Now he has dispatched another letter to state Transportation Commissioner Marie Therese Dominguez seeking restoration of the Scajaquada Expressway’s 50 mph speed limit and including 15,000 petition signatures in support.</p>
      <p>Could Giambra be speeding toward political resurrection?</p>
