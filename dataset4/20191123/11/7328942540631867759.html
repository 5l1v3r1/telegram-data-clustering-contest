      <h1>What Has the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Taught Us So Far?</h1>
      <h2>After a century of looking for signs of intelligent life, humanity is still searching. But have we come close to finding something?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:47:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:47</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew S. Williams</a></address>
      <p>As Enrico Fermi famously once said, "Where is everybody"?" These words were uttered in the summer of 1950 when the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) was heating up. They also captured the frustrations and unresolved questions surrounding the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>
      <p>At the time, scientists were of the belief that statistically speaking, life had to be plentiful in our Universe. This is still something of a consensus, seeing as how the Universe is so very, very big and there are countless planets out there for life to take root on.</p>
      <p>

          <b>RELATED: MEGASTRUCTURES - A SIGN OF LARGER THAN LIFE ALIENS?</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>And yet, all efforts to find that life so far have produced nothing - at least, nothing definitive. What these efforts have done is given our greatest scientific minds the opportunity to test various methods, theoretical frameworks, and the purpose of the search itself.</p>
      <p>So to build on the words of the late and great Enrico Fermi, let's take a look at the history of SETI so far and ask the question, "What have we learned?"</p>

      <h3>Why are we looking?</h3>
      <p>Humanity has been looking for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence for more than a century. However, our species has been contemplating the existence of intelligent life beyond Earth for much, much longer.</p>
      <p>One could easily make the argument that looking for life beyond our planet is the result of us wanting to push our physical and intellectual boundaries. As long as humans have been around, we have been preoccupied with what we don't know.</p>
      <p>In this sense, searching for signs of life beyond Earth is no different than contemplating the origins of the Universe, the meaning of life, or the possible existence of the divine. Into that great unknown, we've always hurled our hopes, fears, and most vivid imaginings.</p>
      <p>Call it curiosity, call it anthropocentrism, call it arrogance, call it destiny, but there has been a drive to look out into the cosmos and ponder whether or not there are any species like us out there (aka. intelligent).</p>
      <p>To be fair, this term presents all calls of difficulties, not the least of which are philosophical or ethical. On top of that, our search efforts are limited because our technology and frame of reference are similarly limited. So perhaps a quick tutorial on the relevant terminology and strictures is in order.</p>
      <p>Ready? Here we go!</p>
      <h3>What are we looking for?</h3>
      <p>Are far as we can tell, the existence of life is dependent upon the availability of certain elements and the presence of certain conditions. One of the most important of these is what scientists refer to as a "<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/ames/kepler/habitable-zones-of-different-stars">circumsolar habitable zone</a>" (CHZ).</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/nWOVLRKN6o/sizes/complifezonewtxt-full_resize_md.jpg"/>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Also known as a "Goldilocks zone" or "habitable zone" (HZ), this term refers to the range of distances around a star where water can exist in liquid form on the surface of a planet. Planets that are too close will have lost their water to evaporation while planets that are too far will only have water in the form of ice.</p>
      <p>These ranges depend on the type of star being studied. Blue/white stars (O-, B-, and A-type) are significantly larger and hotter than other types, so their habitable zones are likely to be wider and farther away. M-type red dwarf stars, which are the smallest and coolest stars in the Universe, are likely to have smaller habitable zones that are much closer to the star.</p>
      <p>Those that are in between - such as G-type yellow dwarfs (like our Sun) - are likely to have habitable zones similar to that of our Sun. This corresponds to a distance of about <b>150 million km (</b><b>93 million mi)</b>, or one Astronomical Unit (AU), which is the average distance between Earth and the Sun.</p>
      <p>Planets within this zone are also examined for signs of chemical elements that we associate with life (aka. biosignatures). These include carbon dioxide, which is essential for photosynthesis, is emitted by complex organisms, and allows for the stabilization of temperatures through the Greenhouse Effect.</p>
      <p>Oxygen is another since it is indicative of plant life and photosynthetic organisms, and is also essential for complex life. Since nitrogen is also an important buffer gas (making up over <b>78%</b> percent of Earth's atmosphere), it is also considered essential.</p>
      <p>Methane is an organic molecule that is often the result of biological processes - such as the decay of organic tissue or digestion in some animals (such as cows). Therefore, its presence in a planet's atmosphere is considered a potential sign of life.</p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Hydrogen gas is also considered a biosignature by some scientists for three reasons. First, the presence of hydrogen in an atmosphere can have a warming effect similar to carbon dioxide and therefore extend the range of a star's habitable zone.</p>
      <p>Second, it is a possible indication of volcanic (and geological) activity on a planet's surface, which is considered essential for life as we know it. Third, hydrogen gas is often the result of chemical disassociation of water due to exposure to UV radiation.</p>
      <p>In this process, water is broken down into oxygen and hydrogen gas, the latter of which is lost to space. Hydrogen gas is therefore seen as a possible indication of water on a planet's surface.</p>
      <p>Aside from biological indications, SETI research is also highly-focused on searching for signs of technological activity (aka. technosignatures). The most time-honored method here involves surveys using radio telescopes, which search for signs of extraterrestrial transmissions.</p>
      <p>Scientists have suggested that other activities should be searched for as well, including directed energy emissions (aka. laser). Assuming that extraterrestrials use lasers for communications and other purposes, astronomers could observe nearby stars and exoplanets for errant flashes of laser light or laser beacons.</p>
      <p>Other means of communication that astronomers have recommended searching for include <a href="http://meti.org/blog/does-et-talk-zeta-rays">neutrinos</a> and <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/F/Fast+Radio+Bursts">Fast Radio Bursts</a> (FRBs) to <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/aace79/meta">gravitational waves</a>. However, radio transmissions remain the only technosignature that scientists have monitored for.</p>
      <h3>A brief history of SETI</h3>
      <p>While it is impossible to pinpoint precisely when human beings looked up at the sky and wondered if there was life in the cosmos, some of the earliest recorded examples come to us from as early as Classical Antiquity.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xtEh84pTxcE" width="640" height="360" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>For example, in the time of Greek philosopher Anaximander (ca. 610 - 546 BCE), the existence of life on other worlds was the subject of metaphysical philosophical debate. By the time of Democritus (ca. 460 - 370 BCE), the idea was formalized with the term "cosmic pluralism".</p>
      <p>In the 2nd century CE, Assyrian satirist Lucian of Samasota wrote <i><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45858">A True History</a>,</i> which contained a tale about an inhabited Moon. While intended as a humorous tale, this story indicated that far more ancient tales of civilization beyond Earth existed.</p>
      <p>Similarly, extraterrestrial life is depicted in ancient works like <i><a href="https://www.wdl.org/en/item/7354/">The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter</a> </i>(aka. <i>The Tale of Princess Kaguya</i>), a 10th century CE Japanese narrative. The protagonist of this story, Princess Kaguya, is a celestial being who was sent from the Moon, and her people eventually return to reclaim her.</p>
      <p>Another example is the medieval Arabic tale, <i>The Adventures of Bulukiya</i>, which is part of compendium the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Thousand-and-One-Nights"><i>One Thousand and One</i> <i>Nights </i></a>(aka. <i>Arabian Nights</i>). The story centers on a protagonist whose quest for the herb of immortality takes him to heaven and hell and across the cosmos to various populated worlds.</p>
      <p>This trend would continue well into the early modern age and the 20th century, with writers like Johann Kepler, H.G. Wells, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Olaf Stapleton speculating about the existence of civilizations on other planets in the Solar System or beyond.</p>
      <p>However, it was not until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that the first efforts were made to confirm the existence of life beyond Earth, and the efforts were largely focused on the planet Mars. At the time, astronomers and scientists believed that Mars was potentially habitable and even boasted its own indigenous "Martian" civilization.</p>

      <p>Famed inventor and electrical engineer <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/7-inventions-of-nikola-tesla-that-were-never-built">Nikola Tesla</a> is credited for conducting the first SETI experiment. In 1896, he suggested how a scaled-up version of his wireless electrical transmission system could be used to contact a civilization on Mars.</p>
      <p>In 1899, Tesla was conducting experiments at his laboratory in Colorado Springs. While working with electrical transmissions in a low-pressure environment, he reported the possible detection of a signal from Mars. Though never confirmed, his instruments did register an odd static signal that ceased when Mars set in the sky.</p>
      <p>With the dawn of the Space Age in 1958, SETI research received far more attention and investment. Between the 1950s and 1960s, the first projects that targeted other star systems were mounted.</p>
      <p>In 1960, Francis Drake conducted the first modern SETI experiment known as <a href="https://www.seti.org/seti-institute/project/details/early-seti-project-ozma-arecibo-message">Project Ozma</a> using the<a href="https://greenbankobservatory.org/science/telescopes/gbt/"> Green Bank Telescope</a> in West Virginia. This project consisted of a radio survey of Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani but found nothing of concrete value.</p>
      <p>There are also the efforts of the <a href="http://www.bigear.org/">Ohio State Radio Observatory</a>, also known as the “Big Ear” Observatory. Built in 1957, this flat-plane radio telescope would play a major role in multiple SETI surveys and would be responsible for one of the most significant possible detections ever made (see WOW! Signal, below).</p>
      <p>From this point forward, SETI surveys became far more common. In 1971, NASA greenlighted a study known as <a href="http://www.coseti.org/cyclops.htm">Project Cyclops</a>, which called for the construction of a <b>1,500</b> radio antenna array to search for extraterrestrial signals. While it was never built, the report informed much of the SETI work that followed.</p>

      <p>In 1979, the <a href="https://seti.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley SETI Research Center</a> launched an initiative known as the <a href="https://seti.berkeley.edu/SERENDIP.html">Search for Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent Populations</a> (SERENDIP).</p>
      <p>This program consisted of analyzing deep-space radio telescope data obtained by large radio telescopes - like those located at the Green Bank and Arecibo Observatory. It has also led to the development of improved spectrometers for the sake of conducting SETI research.</p>
      <p>In 1980, Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray and Louis Friedman (from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory) came together to create the U.S. <a href="http://www.planetary.org/">Planetary Society</a>.  As part of their mandate to further SETI research, this society has played a significant role in the development of SETI-related programs and software.</p>
      <p>These include Sentinel, a project that ran from 1983 to 1985 and relied on the Harvard/Smithsonian radio telescope at <a href="http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/OakRidge/">Oak Ridge Observatory</a>. These efforts were followed in 1985 and 1995 with the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/340956/pdf">Megachannel Extra-Terrestrial Assay</a> (META) and the <a href="http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/OakRidge/meta.html">Billion-channel Extraterrestrial Assay</a> (BETA), respectively.</p>
      <p>In 1992, NASA launched the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1993ASPC...47..335K">Microwave Observing Program</a> (MOP), a long-term effort to survey <b>800</b> stars that are relatively close to the Solar System. This project relied on NASA's <a href="https://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/">Deep Space Network</a> (DSN), the Green Bank Telescope and Arecibo Observatory's <b>300 m (1000 ft)</b> radio telescope.</p>
      <p>Congress canceled the program in 1993, forcing the MOP team to continue without government funding. By 1995, the SETI Institute resurrected the program under the name <a href="https://www.seti.org/seti-institute/project/details/project-phoenix">Project Phoenix</a>. By 2004, the project had observed no less than <b>800</b> stars within a <b>200 light-year radius</b> of Earth.</p>

      <p>In 2016, Russian-Israeli billionaire Yuri Milner founded <a href="https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/">Breakthrough Initiatives</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to interstellar exploration and SETI. A major effort launched by this organization is the project known as <a href="https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/initiative/1">Breakthrough Listen</a> - a ten-year, <b>$100 million</b> effort that constitutes the largest SETI program mounted to date.</p>
      <p>This project relies on radio wave observations from the Green Bank and <a href="https://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/">Parkes Observatory</a>, as well as optical surveys made by the <a href="https://www.ucolick.org/public/telescopes/apf.html">Automated Planet Finder</a> (APF). Combined with innovative software and data analysis techniques, this program will survey <b>1 million</b> of the nearest stars to Earth and the <b>100</b> closest galaxies for signs of radio and laser transmissions.</p>
      <p>That same year, China finished work on the <a href="http://fast.bao.ac.cn/">Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope</a> (FAST) - aka. Tianyan, or the “Eye of Heaven”). This antenna dish is currently the largest filled-aperture radio telescope in the world (previously, it was Arecibo) and much of its operations in the near future will consist of SETI research.</p>
      <p>In 2017, the <a href="https://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/solutions/facilities/drao.html">Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory</a> (DRAO) finished construction on a dedicated interferometric radio telescope. Known as the <a href="https://chime-experiment.ca/">Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment</a> (CHIME), this telescope will be intrinsic to the study of FRBs (see the Lorimar Burst, below).</p>
      <p>Radio surveys have been (or continue to be) made by the SETI Institute’s <a href="https://www.seti.org/ata">Allen Telescope Array</a>, the <a href="https://public.nrao.edu/visit/very-large-array/">Very Large Array</a> (VLA), and the <a href="https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/">SETI@home project</a>. There have also been multiple near optical and near-infrared light (NIL) surveys of the Milky Way and other galaxies.</p>
      <p>These have been performed using instruments like the <a href="https://neowise.ipac.caltech.edu/">Near-Earth Object Wide-field Survey Explorer</a> (NEOWISE), and the <a href="https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/hires/">Keck/High-Resolution Echelle Spectrometer</a> (HIRES), the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/WISE/mission/index.html">Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer</a> (WISE) and <a href="https://old.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/">Two Micron All-Sky Survey</a> (2MASS).</p>

      <h3>Possible alien signals</h3>
      <p>Okay, so with all these surveys and all these dedicated facilities, what exactly what we found? As it turns out, there have been a few instances where potential signals were detected.</p>
      <p>And while follow-up surveys have been unable to offer confirmation in any of these cases, scientists have not been able to rule out the possibility of an extraterrestrial intelligence being involved. So here they are in chronological order...</p>
      <p>
        <b>WOW! Signal:</b>
      </p>
      <p>This event, which is considered by many to be the best candidate for an extraterrestrial radio signal, occurred on August 15th, 1977. On this date, the Ohio State Radio Observatory received a very strong radio signal that appeared to be coming from the direction of the Sagittarius constellation.</p>
      <p>On the following day, volunteer astronomer Jerry Ehman circled the indicated signal on a printout and wrote “WOW!” next to it in the margin. This event came to be known as the “<a href="https://www.seti.org/happy-birthday-wow">WOW! Signal</a>”, but follow-up surveys of the Sagittarius constellation have failed to provide confirmation.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lorimer Burst:</b>
      </p>
      <p>In 2007, Duncan Lorimer (a professor of astrophysics at the University of West Virginia) assigned his student (David Narkevic) to examing archival data obtained by the Parkes radio dish in 2001. Analysis of the data found a radio burst that lasted just <b>5 milliseconds</b> and was coming from a location near the <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/S/Small+Magellanic+Cloud">Small Magellanic Cloud</a> (SMC).</p>
      <p>This event, which came to be known as the Lorimer Burst, was the first-ever detected. By 2013, several more events were detected, which would henceforth be designated as <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/F/Fast+Radio+Bursts">Fast Radio Bursts</a> (FRB). By 2016, evidence of a repeating FRB was found in archival data obtained by the Arecibo radio telescope.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mDT8xDtliS8" width="640" height="360" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>To date, the exact cause of FRBs remains unknown. While many scientists have theorized that they could be the result of natural phenomena like a rapidly rotating neutron star or a black hole, some have gone as far as to suggest that they may be evidence of <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/127669/fast-radio-bursts-on-repeat-were-not-saying-its-aliens-but/">extraterrestrial transmissions</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tabby's Star:</b>
      </p>
      <p>In 2015, citizen astronomers with the <a href="https://blog.planethunters.org/">Planet Hunters</a> project <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.03622v1.pdf">published a paper</a> detailing their observations of  <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/122865/whats-orbiting-kic-8462852-shattered-comet-or-alien-megastructure/">KIC 8462852</a> - a star located<b> 1,470 light-years</b> from Earth. Using data obtained by the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/main/index.html">Kepler Space Telescope</a>, the team detected a <b>22%</b> drop in brightness that could not be explained.</p>
      <p>The star would come to be nicknamed Tabby’s Star (aka. Boyajian’s Star) after team leader Tabetha Boyajian. From 2015 to 2018, the star experienced additional dimming events of varying magnitudes that deepened the mystery.</p>
      <p>Multiple attempts were made to explain these patterns, which included transiting comets, a consumed planet, a debris disk, a ring system, and others. However, some suggested that the dimming possibly the result of an alien megastructure orbiting the star.</p>
      <p>On <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/131680/search-alien-signals-around-tabbys-star/">October 26th, 2016</a>, Breakthrough Listen observed Tabby’s Star for eight hours for signs of radio signals. In the months that followed, follow-ups observations were made, but no signals have been detected.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.10161.pdf">December 2018</a>, a search for laser light emissions was carried out using the APF. While a number of candidates were identified, further analysis showed that they were terrestrial in origin (aka. coming from the Earth).</p>
      <p>
        <b>"Disappearing" Stars:</b>
      </p>
      <p>In 2016, a team of astrophysicists from Uppsala University suggested that SETI researchers should look for signs of "<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08992v1.pdf">physically impossible effects caused by highly advanced technology</a>" by looking for stars and galaxies that suddenly became undetectable.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0RYvwpSqmEM" width="640" height="360" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>To illustrate their point, the team examined the positions, proper motions, magnitudes of 10 million celestial objects that were observed as part of the <a href="https://www.sdss.org/">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a> (SDSS). Specifically, they were looking for objects that did not appear to be in their expected positions.</p>
      <p>In the end, the team found one star that was visible in one image but significantly dimmer in the next. The team advised that this star be the target of follow-up observations to determine if this is the result of a natural phenomenon or not.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Breakthrough Listen:</b>
      </p>
      <p>In April 2017, the project released its first set of results, which included <b>11</b> events that passed the threshold for significance. However, it was concluded that they were all consistent with radio frequency interference.</p>
      <p>On August 30, 2017, Breakthrough Listen said it picked a series of <b>15</b> FRBs coming from a dwarf galaxy about <b>3 billion light-years</b> away. Breakthrough Listen researchers said the possibility of source being extraterrestrial life can't be ruled out as yet.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Oumuamua:</b>
      </p>
      <p>On <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/137621/first-interstellar-comet-discovered/">October 19th, 2017</a>, the <a href="https://panstarrs.stsci.edu/">Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System</a>-1 (Pan-STARRS-1) announced the detection of an interstellar object as it made a flyby of Earth. This object, designated 1I/2017 U1 (aka. ‘Oumuamua), was the first object of its kind to ever be detected.</p>
      <p>Multiple follow-up observations were conducted as the object left the Solar System to determine its true nature and origin. Initially, astronomers believed that the object was a comet, but then concluded that it must be an asteroid since it failed to form a tail when it made its closest approach to the Sun.</p>

      <p>However, 'Oumuamua also sped up as it was leaving the Solar System, which was more consistent with a comet. Multiple explanations were offered, including a paper by postdoctoral researcher Shmuel Baily and Harvard professor Abraham Loeb, who suggested it could be an <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.11490.pdf">interstellar probe</a>.</p>
      <p>In short, Loeb and Baily argued that 'Oumuamua's behavior was consistent with a solar sail. Breakthrough Listen even dedicated survey time to monitor 'Oumuamua for signs of radio transmissions in <a href="https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/news/14">December of 2017</a>, but found nothing.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the behavior and trajectory of the object (which took it on direct course past Earth) are all seen as possible indications that 'Oumuamua could have actually been a survey probe sent from another star system.</p>
      <p>This has led astronomers to recommend that observations be conducted with future interstellar objects - such as <a href="http://www.esa.int/Safety_Security/Interstellar_2.0">C/2019 Q4 (Borisov)</a>. It has also been recommended that spacecraft (like <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1711/1711.03155.pdf">Project Lyra</a> or the ESA's "<a href="http://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/ESA_s_new_mission_to_intercept_a_comet">Comet Interceptor</a>") be sent to study one of these objects up close.</p>
      <p>This is an especially tantalizing possibility considering that astronomers have concluded that interstellar objects pass through our Solar System on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10254.pdf">regular basis</a> (and some <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.09632.pdf">even stay</a>!)</p>
      <h3>Messages sent from Earth</h3>
      <p>In addition to listening to the Universe for signs of extraterrestrial signals, there is also the approach known as "Active SETI". This consists of crafting messages to send to space in the hopes that another species might pick up on the transmission and eventually answer.</p>

      <p>The term Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence (METI) also summarizes this approach. It was coined by Russian scientist Alexander Zaitsev, who sought to draw a distinction between the passive and active methods of searching for alien intelligence in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0610/0610031.pdf">2006 paper</a>.</p>
      <p>So what have we had to say to our celestial brethren?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Morse Message:</b>
      </p>
      <p>In 1962, scientists from the <a href="http://www.npointercos.jp/Eupatoria.html">Evpatoria Planetary Radar</a> (EPR) center in the Crimea sent out a radio message in Morse Code to the planet Venus. The first word was three letters - M-I-R - spelling the Russian word for "peace", which was subsequently followed by "Lenin" and "SSSR"</p>
      <p>This message was the first radio broadcast intended for an extraterrestrial civilization in the history of humanity. The signals bounced off the surface off Venus and were received about four and a half minutes later.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Arecibo Signal:</b>
      </p>
      <p>In 1974, the most powerful METI broadcast ever sent into space was made from the Arecibo Observatory. Known as the <a href="https://www.seti.org/seti-institute/project/details/arecibo-message">Arecibo Message</a>, this message consisted of a simple visual message composed by Francis Drake and Carl Sagan.</p>
      <p>The message consisted of <b>1,679</b> binary digits that were arranged rectangularly in <b>73</b> rows by <b>23</b> columns (prime numbers, or the product of thereof). The message contained a number of easy-to-understand elements in different colors that would presumably be discernible to an intelligent species.</p>

      <p>From top to bottom, this included the numbers one to ten, the atomic numbers of the ingredients in DNA (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus), the formulas for sugars and bases in the nucleotides of DNA, the number of nucleotides in DNA, a graphic of the double helix structure of DNA, and a stick-figure depicting the profile of a human.</p>
      <p>Also included was the human population of Earth, a graphic of the Solar System (with Earth indicated), a graphic of the Arecibo radio telescope and the dimensions of the antenna dish. The message was aimed at the globular star cluster M13 located <b>21,000 light-years</b> from Earth.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pioneer Plaque:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/706/pioneer-plaque/">Pioneer Plaque</a> was the first "message in a bottle" sent by humanity into space. The brainchild of Carl Sagan, this plaque was included on the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/missions/archive/pioneer.html"><i>Pioneer 10</i> and<i> 11</i></a> missions and depicts the location of Earth in the Galaxy, as well as a naked man and woman drawn in relation to the spacecraft.</p>
      <p>These spacecraft are heading towards the star Aldebaran in the Taurus constellation and the constellation of Aquila, respectively, and will take millions of years to get there. Nevertheless, both plaques could be intercepted in interstellar space long before they reach their destinations.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Voyager Golden Record:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The “<a href="https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/golden-record/">Golden Record</a>” of the <a href="https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/"><i>Voyager 1</i> and<i> 2</i></a> space probes (both which are now in interstellar space!) took things a step further. Whereas the Pioneer Plaque was intended as a message in a bottle, the Golden Record was more of a "time capsule".</p>
      <p>This attempt to communicate with extraterrestrials was also crafted by Carl Sagan, along with many of his colleagues from Cornell University. In addition to the cover (which depicted instructions on how to play it), the record contained sounds and images selected to portray life and culture on Earth.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Public Messages:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Countless messages have been composed and transmitted by space agencies, non-profit groups, or as part of privately-funded projects. These include the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/annotated-cosmic-call-primer-180960566/">Cosmic Call</a> (1/2), the <a href="http://www.setileague.org/articles/tam.htm">Teen Age Message</a>, <a href="https://amessagefrom.earth/">A Message From Earth</a>, the <a href="https://www.livescience.com/21171-wow-signal-alien-message-reply.html">WOW! Reply</a>, the <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/102844/lone-signal-first-continous-message-beacon-to-find-and-say-hello-to-an-extraterrestrial-civilization/">Lone Signal</a>, and the <a href="http://www.ascus.org.uk/a-simple-response/">ASREM</a> message.</p>
      <p>All were conducted between 1999 to 2016 and targeted stars between<b> 17</b> and<b> 69 light-years</b> from the Earth. In the coming years, <a href="https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/initiative/2">Breakthrough Message</a> plans to mount an international competition to create messages that would be broadcast using their participating institutes. A total prize pool of $1,000,000 will be awarded to the winning entries.</p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>So what have we learned? For starters, we've learned that SETI is very challenging work and that Fermi's question cannot be answered so easily. We've also amassed a small catalog of possible signals and detections that - while they are not yet confirmed - cannot be ruled out.</p>
      <p>In the end, all we can do is count on the process of continuous discovery and look to future developments and more sophisticated instruments. In the coming years, several next-generation space and ground-based observatories will be coming online that are expected to be game-changers.</p>
      <p>Between better instruments, better data-mining and sharing, and more precise techniques for discerning the presence of biological and/or technological activity, humanity stands to make some impressive discoveries in the near future... or not.</p>
      <p>For as Arthur C. Clarke famously declared: "Two possibilities exist: Either we are alone in the universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying." And as always, there is the possibility that we will not learn which is true before our species goes extinct. <br/><br/>Only time will tell if humanity achieves "First Contact", or is forced to endure the "Great Silence".</p>
