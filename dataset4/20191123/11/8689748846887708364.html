      <p>Manifest for some time now has literary become a “lawyer of beef” who is hired by artistes to bring down the hard-earned reputation of other artistes into disrepute.</p>
      <p>For the purpose of clarity, let me take you back to the time Strongman and rapper Medikal engaged themselves in a fierce lyrical war. In the course of the banter, Manifest teamed up with Strongman and came out with a song titled “Ups &amp; Down”.</p>

At the blind side of Ghanaians, Manifest has maneuvered his ways to team up with Kelvyn Boy on a song.</p>

      <p><b>“Yawa No Dey”</b> happens to be the title of the and analysing the lyrical content of the trending vibe, no one needs a rocket scientist to assert that the duo recorded the song with Stonebwoy in mind.</p>
