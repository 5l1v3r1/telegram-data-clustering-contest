      <h1>The 1 Thing to Brush on Turkey to Make It Ultra Crispy and Golden Brown</h1>

      <p>Everyone wants a perfectly golden-brown turkey with crisp skin, but what's the trick? I asked a Turkey Talk expert at <a href="http://www.butterball.com/">Butterball</a>, who said America has got to <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Should-You-Baste-Your-Turkey-39192468">stop basting</a> and glazing. I know this goes against everything generations before you may have said, but basting the bird just cools down the oven and makes the turkey take longer to <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Burning-Question-What-Temperature-Turkey-Cooked-6309330">reach the right temperature</a>.</p>

      <p>The turkey skin will brown, so long as you brush it with a high-heat oil or clarified butter before putting in the oven. Butterball says turkey skin is like a raincoat and the drippings just drip right off, anyway. So why bother basting? The drippings can be used for the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Easy-Turkey-Gravy-Recipe-25929323">gravy</a>.</p>

      <p>In addition, don't open the oven repeatedly. It's so tempting to check on the bird, but use the oven light for that. Position the turkey and the oven-safe thermometer in such a way that you can read the temperature through the window. However, if your oven doesn't have a window (or you don't have an oven-safe thermometer), there's always simple math. <a href="http://www.butterball.com/calculators-and-conversions">Calculate the amount of time it will take you to cook the bird</a>, and rely on a timer.</p>
