      <p>Life has changed forever for one lottery player.</p>
      <p>A ticket-holder has now come forward to claim the £105m <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/euromillions">EuroMillions</a> jackpot prize which was won on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The winner is from the UK but it has not been revealed exactly where in the country they are.</p>
      <p>National <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/lottery">Lottery</a> operator Camelot said the winner had scooped a total of £105,100,701.90.</p>
      <p>Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at The National Lottery, said: "This is the sixth massive EuroMillions jackpot win in 2019 and follows the nation's biggest ever win of £170m just last month.</p>
      <p>"We now focus on supporting the ticket-holder as they start to enjoy their new-found wealth."</p>
      <p>Lottery winners can choose to keep their anonymity or go public with their big win.</p>
      <p>A UK ticket-holder won a £170m EuroMillions jackpot in October, making them the UK's biggest ever winner.</p>
      <p>The previous biggest UK winners were Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs in North Ayrshire, Scotland, who won £161m in July 2011.</p>
      <p>A £123m jackpot was won by a UK ticket-holder in June and a UK winner scooped £38m in the EuroMillions in April.</p>
      <p>Ade Goodchild, from Hereford, bagged £71m on March 15 and Patrick and Frances Connolly, from Northern Ireland, won £114.9m on New Year's Day.</p>
