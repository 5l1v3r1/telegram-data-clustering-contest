      <p>Lego is coming to the LA Auto Show for the first time, and it's bringing its Lego Top Gear rally car. The models is billed as being for ages nine and above, but we're not ashamed to be excited despite being well above the base age. It's not based on any specific car, but Lego got together with Top Gear to design the body and graphics. It looks like it'll satisfy both our inner child and inner nerd despite not being the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mini/clubman">Mini Cooper</a> Top Gear has been using for its Star In A Rally Car segment.</p>
      <p>It's a 463-piece set and includes a Lego large Motor, an XL Motor, and Bluetooth controlled smart hub so it can be controlled by Leg's smartphone app.</p>

      <p>"It's exciting to have collaborated with Lego Technic on this and it's a very natural fit for the Top Gear brand. The Lego Technic Top Gear Rally Car is the result of several months' hard work from the Lego and BBC Studios teams and we can't wait to see it on the shelves soon" said Jason Easy, Head of Licensing UK, BBC Studios.</p>
      <p>It strikes us a good fit, given Top Gear's long-standing reputation for child-like fun. According to Niels Henrik Horsted, Marketing Director for Lego Technic, "The car offers a challenging build for ages 9+ who are into authentic play and intrigued about how things work. The Control+ app gives an extensive play experience with several different play modes and exciting challenges."</p>

      <p>From the Lego Technic Control+ app, the acceleration of the Lego Top Gear rally car can be controlled along with the steering and reverse functions. The app also boasts multi-touch and gyro control as well as challenges and achievements "to deliver a thrilling, immersive play experience."</p>
      <p>The Lego Top Gear rally car will be available globally on December 26. Why it's being released the day after Christmas we don't know, but it'll cost $129.99 and looks a lot <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/land-rover-defender-looks-awesome-in-lego">less complicated to build than some of the other cool Lego Technic cars</a> we've seen recently.</p>
