      <h1>Maha: Betrayal of people's mandate, says Congress</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:54:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The Congress hit out at Devendra Fadnavis being sworn-in as the Maharashtra chief minister on Saturday, saying it was a "betrayal of people's mandate" and the "illegitimate" government formation will self-destruct.</p>
      <p>The month-long political impasse in Maharashtra ended dramatically on Saturday with the BJP's Fadnavis returning as the chief minister, backed by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).</p>
      <p>NCP's Ajit Pawar was sworn-in as the deputy chief minister.Â </p>
      <p>"This is called a betrayal of people's mandate and giving the contract for killing democracy," Congress's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>He also tagged media reports on allegations of Ajit Pawar's involvement in scams.</p>
      <p>"Lust for power washes away principles and corruption," Surjewala said on Twitter, tagging a September tweet of Fadnavis in which he had said the BJP will never ally with the NCP as it had "exposed" the latter's corruption.</p>
      <p>Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel, who was at the forefront of the Congress-NCP-Shiv Sena negotiations, said illegal and evil manoeuvres took place in the secrecy of midnight.</p>
      <p>"Such was the shame that they had to do the swearing-in hiding. This illegitimate formation will self destruct," he said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>Earlier, senior Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi expressed surprise at the political developments in Maharashtra and said the Congress-NCP-Shiv Sena negotiations took too long as the window was grabbed by "fast movers".</p>
      <p>"Surreal wht I read abt #Maharashtra. Thought it was fake news. Candidly &amp;personally speaking, our tripartite negotiations shd not have gone on for more than 3 days...took too long. Window given was grabbed by fast movers. #pawarji tussi grt ho! Amazing if true, still not sure (sic)," he said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, in another tweet, Singhvi said, "My tweet at 845 am today while in a taking off flight to ahmdabad has, hopefully, been overtaken by events in view of #Sharadji's clarification. Even then I had called it surreal &amp;possibly fake news. Appears that fakeness of full #NCP joining bjp is true as per #Pawar clarfn (sic)."</p>
