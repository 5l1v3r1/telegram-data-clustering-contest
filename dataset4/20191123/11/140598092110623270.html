      <p>This hearty sausage dish only requires 10 minutes of hands-on work, then you can let the oven do all the rest. </p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>5 minutes |<b> Cooking time: </b>55 minutes </p>
      <h3>SERVES </h3>
      <p>four</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 ½ tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>8 good-quality sausages</li>
        <li>1 large onion or 2 medium-sized, peeled and cut into half-moon-shaped wedges</li>
        <li>2 large just-ripe pears</li>
        <li>4 sprigs rosemary</li>
        <li>15g butter</li>
        <li>6 tbsp honey</li>
        <li>2 tbsp balsamic vinegar</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 190C/170C fan/Gas 5.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a frying-pan and brown the sausages on a high heat until they have a good colour but are not cooked through. Move to an ovenproof dish large enough to hold the sausages and pears snugly in a single layer.</li>
        <li>Put the onions in the pan and cook quickly until pale gold. Add to the sausages.</li>
        <li>Halve the pears (there’s no need to peel them), cut each half into three wedges and add to the dish with the rosemary sprigs. Heat the butter in a small pan and add the honey and balsamic. Stir to melt, then pour over everything in the dish. Season, toss everything around in the butter and honey and finish with the pears cut-side up.</li>
        <li>Bake for 45 minutes. The pears should be tender and golden and the sausages cooked through. Serve with buttered cabbage.</li>
