      <p>LAGOS: The day his wife walked out 10 years ago, Nigerian musician Jagunlabi started taking drugs to make the shadows go away.</p>
      <p>The drugs came to stay.</p>

      <p>Today, after suffering a heart attack, Jagunlabi is desperate to end his addiction but has no idea how to get help.</p>
      <p>"I don't know where to go, I can't trust (rehab) centres here," he told AFP, sitting in a park in the nation's economic capital Lagos. "They can chain you, molest you."</p>
      <p>Substance abuse in Africa's most populous country has been described as an "epidemic" by the United Nations but there is almost no proper treatment available for those trying to recover.</p>
      <p>The grim problem has come to light after a string of raids on so-called rehabilitation centres where hundreds of inmates, mainly men and boys, have been found chained and abused in atrocious conditions.</p>
      <p>The unregulated institutes - billed as Islamic schools or run by evangelical churches - are used by desperate families who often send relatives struggling with drugs, drink or mental illness in the hope they will get better.</p>
      <p>But the treatment is brutal and relies more on prayer than proven medical interventions.</p>
      <p>Jagunlabi, who gave only his stage name, recounted how his family had tried to take him to a religious camp just two days earlier.</p>
      <p>"A week of prayer and fasting? it would kill me. I'm too weak," he said.</p>
      <p>Once a successful performer who has now seen his career destroyed by addiction, he showed off newspaper clippings about his music from the early 2000s.</p>
      <p>"I used to be big," he said. "I need medication, I need to sleep".</p>
      <p>
        <b>JUST 300 PSYCHIATRISTS</b>
      </p>
      <p>The scandal over the abusive centres - dubbed "horror houses" by the media - has put pressure on the authorities.</p>
      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari insisted "no responsible democratic government would tolerate the existence of the torture chambers" and officials have sought to close the worst of them.</p>
      <p>But moves to clamp down on the facilities have had mixed results.</p>
      <p>In the city of Kano, in mainly Muslim northern Nigeria where most of the abusive institutes have been uncovered, many relatives have refused to pick up those freed from the centres.</p>
      <p>Part of the problem is they have nowhere else to take them.</p>
      <p>Across Nigeria, a vast country of almost 200 million people, there are only some 300 psychiatrists, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a report in November.</p>
      <p>Many psychiatrists, discouraged by the lack of resources and status, leave left the country, mostly for the West.</p>
      <p>But Dr Ogonnaya Ndupu decided to stay.</p>
      <p>She worked for six years in a state psychiatric hospital. Today, she is employed at Lifecrest Rehabilitation service, a small private centre working with addicts in the middle-class Lagos district of Lekki.</p>
      <p>"When it comes to mental health there is no monitoring going on," she lamented to AFP.</p>
      <p>"We have government facilities but they are in a deplorable state."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile "drug abuse is on the rise in Nigeria", she insisted, as economic problems mount for people across the country.</p>
      <p>"Times are tougher, more challenging for everybody."</p>
      <p>Life is particularly hard in Mushin, an impoverished and violent area of Lagos, where crack cocaine and bottles of codeine cough syrup circulate alongside illegal firearms.</p>
      <p>"Cannabis, ecstasy, cocaine, codeine, tramadol," said local resident Lala, rattling off a list of the illicit substances to be found.</p>
      <p>Already at midday, teenagers, old men and young mothers can be seen smoking marijuana as they try to cushion the come down from their latest trip.</p>
      <p>
        <b>"THE MAIN ISSUE"</b>
      </p>
      <p>An area that locals call the "drug ghetto" has been a no-go zone for the authorities for a long time.</p>
      <p>But one person who can enter there is Pastor Keji Hamilton - on a self-proclaimed mission from God to help addicts.</p>
      <p>A former musician who played with Nigerian Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti, Hamilton says he "met Jesus" one day as he inhaled on a crack pipe surrounded by three prostitutes.</p>

      <p>He thought he would die and asked God to save him despite not being a believer.</p>
      <p>Now he is seeking to use more than just the Bible to help people as he tours the mean streets of Mushin.</p>
      <p>Hamilton underwent training in psychology and social care and opened his own professional rehab centre.</p>
      <p>"You need to be trained for this job, you need skills," he told AFP.</p>
      <p>He shakes people's hands and talks to them as he tours the down-trodden neighbourhood - a contact for those struggling with addiction and a message that there is a solution.</p>
      <p>"Drugs are the main issue in Nigeria," he said. "But the government is not interested to solve it."</p>
