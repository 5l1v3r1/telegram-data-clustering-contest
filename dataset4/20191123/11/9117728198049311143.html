        <b>According to Alain Prost, it does not look like six-time world champion<a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton"> Lewis Hamilton</a> of <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> loses the motivation in his aspirations to equal or even break the record of seven world titles from Michael Schumacher. With Hamilton having the lead role in the Silver Arrows team, Prost believes Hamilton has his fate in his own hands. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite his age (34), Hamilton still has sufficient motivation, says Prost: <i>"He currently drives with a lot of experience and expertise,"</i> Prost reports to Motorsport.com. <i>"Sometimes you lose your motivation after so many titles. What is your next goal? It is good that he has a goal to achieve. He is also part of the best team,"</i> he continues.</p>

      <p>The French four-time world champion also thinks that in the future the constructor will continue to give preference to the Brit over teammate Valtteri Bottas :<i> “If you look at drivers like Michael (Schumacher), Ayrton (Senna), even <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian (Vettel)</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max (Verstappen), </a>you will see that numbers one and two are needed. Not everyone wants this and that makes it difficult, but at the highest level that can make a big difference. Lewis and Valtteri can handle such a situation. Valtteri is not far away and is very fast, but Lewis is getting stronger all the time,"</i> said the Frenchman.</p>
