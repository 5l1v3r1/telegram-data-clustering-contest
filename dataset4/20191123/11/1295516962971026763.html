      </p>
      <p>In the annals of <i>Star Wars</i>, very few have gone up against the mighty Darth Vader and lived to tell the tale. Obi-Wan Kenobi fought him when he was still an evil Anakin Skywalker in <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-revenge-of-the-sith/"><i>Revenge of the Sith</i></a>, while Luke tussled with him in <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>, losing a hand in the process. Basically, no one walks away from a fight with this skilled user of the Force alive -- especially if it's hand-to-hand combat. After all, there's a reason Vader is considered the most lethal and unforgiving warlord in the galaxy.</p>

      <p>However, in <i>Star Wars</i> #75, one major rebel shows absolutely no fear of the Dark Side and surprisingly defeats the underestimating Vader in a duel: Chewbacca.</p>

      <p>In the last few issues, the battle's been heating up on the molten rock planet, K-43,  as the rebels -- namely, C-3PO and Chewie -- try to disarm the bombs they planted there to lure and blow Vader's forces up, not realizing there were innocent rock people living there. As all-out war ensues, the Krakans reveal they they have an infinite link to anything made from ore and, therefore, can disarm the bombs by manipulating the metals inside them.</p>
      <p>As their energy flows to the bombs, Vader gets caught in the wave because he's part-machine as well. Although the Krakans don't use their full power as they want to avoid killing C-3PO or accidentally triggering the bombs, this still leaves Vader badly damaged. And when he goes to cut Luke (who comes to rescue his buddies) down, Chewie blindsides Vader by smashing a rock into his head. The Wookiee and the Sith Lord quickly begin trading blows, with Chewie getting in some heavy hits as he spots his enemy's vulnerability.</p>

      <p>This severely disorients Vader, who then tries to Force-choke the Wookiee in a desperate move, only to realize he's not at full-strength. Chewie takes advantage of this too. He breaks free and throws Vader into a lava pit. But like Moses parting the Red Sea, Vader uses the Force to clear the lava away so he doesn't burn up like he did on Mustafar. Luke sees an opening and tries to throw a rock at the Sith, but Vader causes an avalanche when he braces with the Force, leading Luke to fall right in front of him.</p>

      <p>Chewie jumps down to protect Luke. Vader is wary as he knows he's wounded badly and is facing bad odds against the duo since the Wookiee just beat him up. Also, he's sensing the Force swelling in Luke, so he knows the situation is dangerous. This hesitation allows Han and Leia to swoop down and rescue their friends. Everyone fires their blasters at Vader, but Vader repels them all with a Force push. Shockingly, though, when Vader drops to his knees exhausted, his Stormtroopers drag him away because they don't want to let him finish the fight. They know their master's been brutalized and can't risk him against an entire faction. This allows the rebels to escape and live to fight another day.</p>
      <p>As for Vader, he's pissed off a Wookiee just manhandled him. He eventually kills his own men and uses his ship's circuitry to power his robotics back up. After all, he's always had an ego. But by the time he emerges, Chewbacca has already left, leaving Vader steaming and looking for reprisal.</p>
