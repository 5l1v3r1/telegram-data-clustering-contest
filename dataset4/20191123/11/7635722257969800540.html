        <b>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola insists he's happy at the club.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Spain midfielder has led City to back-to-back Premier League titles but are nine-points behind current leaders Liverpool ahead of taking on Chelsea this evening.</p>
      <p>Guardiola's contract runs until the summer of 2021 and he says he wants to stay at the Etihad until then.</p>
      <p>"I want to stay. I don't have any reasons to move from here.</p>
      <p>"I am incredibly satisfied to work with this club, with these players, and if the people think I am going to resign or be sacked for these results and being nine points behind, the people don't know me.</p>
      <p>"I like to be in this challenge, I love to be in this position and if the club wants (me) next season I want to be here, 100 per cent.</p>
      <p>"I want to live in this city because I know lovely people here and I want to work and live with them and I want to be here.</p>
      <p>"If they decide the results are getting worse, they are going to take a decision, that's normal. It's not because I am friends with (director of football) Txiki (Begiristain) that I am going to stay for the rest of my life.</p>
      <p>"I am here because I win. If I don't win I'm in trouble, I know that, but I'm incredibly satisfied to work in this city and with this club and I want to help this club to get better.</p>
      <p>"I still enjoy working with these players a lot and I would like to stay longer, if the club wants, I will stay."</p>
