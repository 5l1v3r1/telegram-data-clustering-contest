      <h2>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is out of contract at the end of next season and Alexandre Lacazette the following year, with Arsenal struggling to reach the top four</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:22:56+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:22</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal have been told they must start being successful again if they want to keep the likes of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are currently sixth in the Premier League but eight points adrift of the top four places - with a fourth successive finish outside the Champions League places currently on the cards.</p>
      <p>Unai Emery hasn't seen his side win in the league since October 6, when they edged out <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> , with the Gunners currently on a run of five matches without a win in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Not only has it led to Emery being placed under pressure, but high quality players are starting to eye up the Emirates exit.</p>

      <p>Aubameyang is out of contract at the end of next season and Lacazette the following year - although both have been rumoured to be eyeing an earlier exit.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> legend Martin Keown reckons for the duo, and others, to remain in north London, the club needs to start targeting silverware again.</p>

      <p>"Well it’s imperative that you hang onto your best players," Keown told <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/pierre-emerick-aubameyang-alexandre-lacazette-will-leave-arsenal-dont-improve-warns-martin-keown-11204399/?ito=newsnow-feed">Metro.</a></p>
      <p>"That’s always the first thing every summer – you want to keep your players first and then add to it. You wouldn’t want to lose Aubameyang or Lacazette but they’ll only stay if Arsenal are successful.</p>
      <p>"Of course they’re waiting [to sign a contract] but they can change history themselves. They can make the change because they’re there, they can inscribe a name on a trophy every year.</p>
      <p>"They are good professionals. I don’t have a difficulty with those two, it’s more how good is the team? Is the team well enough equipped?</p>
      <p>"If they [Aubameyang and Lacazette] don’t think it is then they won’t sign and we’ll lose two other good players. That’s normal. It’s no different for Arsenal as it is for Spurs or <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> ."</p>
