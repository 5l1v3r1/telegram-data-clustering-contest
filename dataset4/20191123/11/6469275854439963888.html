        <b>A Penwortham woman is putting mental health in the spotlight with an open mic night in aid of charity Mind.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Drama graduate Hannah Leahy is holding the event at Penwortham Arts Centre "The Venue" in Liverpool Road on Friday, November 29 at 7pm. Doors open at 6-30pm.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old decided to raise awareness of both mental illness and available support after battling with anxiety and depression for five years. Proceeds from the event, which includes a collection throughout the night, will go towards mental health charity Mind.</p>
      <p>She said: "I've suffered from mental health difficulties myself so I'm really passionate about highlighting this issue. Mind is a really great organisation that offers loads of help and information.</p>
      <p>"I was given support when I was in a dark place and things weren't great.</p>
      <p>"I was thinking about other people who might be in a similar situation and I want to show them that they're not alone."</p>
      <p>Hannah is also a volunteer for a Give Us A Shout, a crisis service funded by Prince William and Kate that allows people to reach out for mental health support via text message.</p>
      <p>She added: "The open mic night is also about bringing people together and getting them out of the house if they might not normally leave it."</p>
      <p>The arts can also offer people an escape from their problems, according to Hannah.</p>
      <p>"I think doing something creative has given me a lot of more confidence to speak up. Theatre and music are a way to express yourself and put how you're feeling into words. It can be really helpful for some people," she said.</p>
      <p>"The arts in general offer a good way to recover. I still suffer with a lot of mental health problems now but I sing and make crafts, and that helps.</p>
      <p>"They give people who are struggling some time to not think about their problems or deal with what's going on inside."</p>
      <p>The open mic will feature an array of local talent, including a five-piece band, acoustic singers, guitarists, a duo and poetry performers.</p>
      <p>"I didn't think many people would want to perform but we've filled up the slots really quickly and had people messaging to say they're coming along to support the event," Hannah said.</p>
      <p>"It just reinforces the message that no-one is alone and I couldn't be more chuffed."</p>
      <p>Entry is by Â£3 donation and includes a glass of fizz or juice.</p>
