      <h1>Strictly has gone ‘gay’? What do people think they’ve been watching all these years?</h1>

        <i>This week’s complaints about two male dancers seem outdated to the point of absurdity. That’s a comforting thought</i>
      </p>
      <p>Homophobia is a serious and continuing problem, but it was difficult this week not to enjoy aspects of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/21/strictly-come-dancings-first-same-sex-routine-sparks-complaints">hoo-ha over Strictly Come Dancing</a>. In what felt like a historical re-enactment of classic 1970s’ curtain-twitching, 189 viewers complained to the BBC about two men partnering each other on primetime telly, and it was hard to know what to laugh at first: the Mary Whitehouse tone of the complaints, the statement on Instagram by one of the dancers – realising the full dramatic potential of the moment – that “love knows no boundaries”, or the idea that the spectacle of two men dancing could ever be the gayest thing about Strictly. What, exactly, do these people think they’ve been watching all these years?</p>
      <p>The numbers of complaints was low, relative to audience figures – even in its 17th season, Strictly can still pull in 8 million viewers on a good night. Nonetheless, there was something vaguely comforting about the fact that, particularly in the context of the recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/16/birmingham-lgbt-lessons-row-protester-invited-imam-high-court-hears">LGBT teaching row</a>, in mainstream culture at least, complaints of this kind about gay representation seem outdated to the point of absurdity.</p>
      <aside>A small minority will always fail to understand the nature of the reality around them</aside>
      <p>In schools, of course, the battle rages on. It can be easy to forget this. My kids go to a big New York elementary school where most iterations of family are represented – and where differences between families are heavily outweighed by the universal condition at the school gate, which is frazzled and shouting. The kid with two dads in the class is remarkable to the other five-year-olds only because, scandalously, she is permitted to stop at Starbucks on the way to school for a cake pop. And when my own kids ask me if I’m ever “going to get married”, they understand that, in the outlandish event I ever devote more than five minutes to something other than them or the laundry, it will be to another woman.</p>
      <p>Even so, the shallowness of this security can occasionally pull one up short. Last week, my daughter brought home from the school library the lesbian picture-book classic Heather Has Two Mommies and I was momentarily floored. When I was at school it would have been illegal for this book to be in any British school library, under a law passed by Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government. I looked up the wording of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/nov/17/uk.gayrights">Section 28 </a>and was amazed to find that, <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2003-03-10.49.4#g90.0">until it was overturned in 2003</a>, not only did it ban local authorities from “promoting” homosexuality, but that, like something drafted by the Westboro Baptist Church, it banned “the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship”. This was five minutes ago. The Conservatives should still be picking up the therapy bills.</p>
      <p>Anyway, at least we got a laugh from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a>, which served as a useful reminder that, irrespective of progress, a small minority will always fail to understand the nature of the reality around them. Best to refer them to Alan Partridge: “For crying out loud, if I really couldn’t bear to consort with homosexuals, do you really think I’d have pursued a career in television? At the BBC of all places?? Be real.”</p>
