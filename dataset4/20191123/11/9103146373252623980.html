      <p><b>A woman last touched my hair in the early 2000s. “Since then, I prefer a male hairdresser,” says Erina Zawedde. Like Zawedde, many women prefer male hairdressers to female ones. </b><br/><br/>So are men better hairdressers than women?<br/><br/>It’s really been long since a female hairdresser touched my hair. Zawedde thinks male hairdressers are better stylists and more creative compared to their female counterparts.<br/><br/>Like Zawedde, many women prefer male hairdressers to female ones. So those that mean men are better hairdressers than women?<br/><br/>Steve Kanene, a mobile hair designer in Mukono says women cherish male hairdressers because they are bold enough to suggest new hairstyles for the women.<br/><br/>“We can even suggest which dress a woman should wear to match with a hairstyle,” says Kanene. <br/><br/>He adds that female hairdressers will most likely stick to the styles the clients want.<br/><br/>Caxtone Buule, a hairstylist in Kampala says women prefer men because they are emotionally calmer than women. <br/><br/>“Female hairdressers often lose their temper especially when faced with a rude customer,” Says Buule<br/><br/>Buule agreed with Kanene that female hairdressers restrict themselves to what customers want while male hairdressers freely apply their creativity to come up with unique hairstyles.<br/><br/>Zawedde justifies her preference for male hairdressers: Women generally do not compliment you. They bore customers.<br/><br/>Sarah Namu who also prefers male hairdressers says men are more creative and interactive.</p>
