        <b>KICKING Boris Johnson out of Number 10 is the first step in restoring 'common decency' according to Gordon Brown.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Labour prime minister wants to see the Tory leader booted out of downing street for a more 'compassionate' United Kingdom.</p>

      <p>He will be speaking at three events across Scotland - in Fife, South Lanarkshire and East Lothian - amid the General Election campaign.</p>
      <p>The politician is set to highlight child poverty as an issue which should be central to concerns of politicians and voters on December 12.</p>
      <p>It comes as 121,925 children in working families north of the border are being forced to live in poor conditions.</p>
      <p>Mr Brown is to say: "Boris Johnson's departure from Downing Street on December 12 is the first step to moving our United Kingdom forward - united again in purpose, compassion and common decency.</p>

      <p>"People talk of the government spending more but austerity has not ended for millions of families with children and millions of low-paid workers.</p>
      <p>"Austerity for them will continue throughout the next parliament if Boris Johnson's policies are implemented.</p>
      <p>"The UK is already torn apart by Brexit, divisive nationalisms, a north-south divide and the crude trolling of vulnerable people of all sides.</p>
      <p>"We are so disunited we have lost sight of a once-compassionate, state-guaranteed safety net and seem unable to work together - even to come to the aid of vulnerable children.</p>
      <p>"Labour is absolutely right to say it will abolish universal credit.</p>
      <p>"This discredited system - the brainchild of Iain Duncan Smith - is chaotic, demeaning and poverty-inducing. Nothing can make it work.</p>
      <p>"The first step to relieving child poverty is the end of universal credit.</p>
      <p>"A caring nation would increase child benefit substantially, raise the child credit, end the withdrawal of benefits from three and four-child families and guarantee that there is always enough housing benefit in place to pay rent."</p>
