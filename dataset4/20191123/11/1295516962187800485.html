      </p>
      <p>While many Disney movies include at least some kind of magical presence, <i>Frozen 2</i> leans completely into this idea with an ethereal and epic story to match. With Elsa, Anna and their allies trying to find a way to soothe the elemental spirits of the wild that are out of control, their entire kingdom is on the line.</p>
      <p>Along the way, Elsa essentially proves herself to be the Disney equivalent of the spiritually-connected Avatar from the Nickelodeon franchise of the same name.</p>

      <h3>THE FIFTH ELEMENT</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Frozen-2.png?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=503&amp;dpr=1.5"/>

      <p>One of the big twists of <i>Frozen 2</i> is the discovery of the fifth element of magic. The separation of people from this element is what made so much of the magical powers in the world fade away. While traveling further and further north, Elsa learns the truth: <i>humanity</i> is the fifth element. When living in a harmonious balance with the elements, people can also live freely with the magic energies that exist in the world.</p>
      <p>In fact, if they're able to forge a strong enough bond with them, then humans could potentially utilize those gifts to their own ends. Elsa learns this through first-hand experience, as she's at first confronted and then befriended by Gale, Bruni and Nokk, the elemental spirits of air, fire and water, respectively. Upon becoming allies, the elements use their powers to assist Elsa in her quest.</p>
      <p>It's also revealed that a dam built by Elsa's Grandfather in the past wasn't only intended to keep a mighty river at bay. It was also partly built to contain the magical properties of the north and keep its people from interfering in the affairs of humanity. This had the unintended consequence of trapping the northern natives and the Arendelle soldiers within the now sleeping enchanted woods, with only the prince (Elsa and Anna's father) escaping thanks to the last second intervention of a young girl who would later become Elsa's mother.</p>
      <p>Destroying the dam is the only way to fully unleash magic and allow humanity to reclaim its place as the fifth element again. Although Elsa is frozen by her powers by this point, Anna is able to learn the truth as well, and helps ensure the destruction of the dam by tricking the Rock Giants into destroying it for her.</p>
      <p>After everything is said and done, Elsa elects to remain behind in the north and renounce her claim to the crown. This way, she can remain free and close to the other elements, keeping them in-check but also happy, while Anna assumes the throne. The bond between the pair becomes the true bridge from magic to humanity, keeping Elsa tied to people in at least some form so she can be both of the elements and a human.</p>
      <p>This, in turn, brings about the balance that had been lost for decades and allows the citizens of Arendelle to continue living in their kingdom.</p>

      <h3>THE AVATAR</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Avatar-Wan-Cropped.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>This idea is strikingly similar to the core principals present in the <i>Avatar</i> franchise: <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/avatar-the-last-airbender/"><i>The Last Airbender</i></a> and <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-legend-of-korra/">The Legend of Korra</a>.</i> The two shows and their tie-in media center around a world where certain people can manipulate the elements. However, there is only one person in particular who can control all four: water, earth, fire and air. Known as the Avatar, they are reincarnated upon every death to continue serving as a protector of the world and the bridge between humanity and the spirit realm. The two shows in the franchise centered first around the care-free but empathetic airbender, Aang, while the second focused on their reincarnation into the headstrong and enthusiastic waterbender, Korra.</p>
      <p>It's very much what Elsa goes through and becomes across her journey, as well. Although she doesn't reincarnate, her mission eventually becomes to open up the spiritual and magical side of the world so the elements could be free and at peace once more. Her role as guardian to the north, while also being maintaining deep connections with the people of Arendelle, allows Elsa to create unity, something that Aang and Korra both strive for and struggle with over the course of their respective stories.</p>
      <p>The specific phrase "the bridge between our two worlds" is used in both <i>Avatar </i>and <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/frozen/"><i>Frozen</i></a> to symbolize what these characters mean in terms of connecting the world of humans to the greater spiritual elements around them.</p>
      <p>Elsa even technically gains access to the other elements, too, thanks to her friendship with the elemental spirits. While she still only naturally has her ice powers, she could easily call upon the elemental spirits for aid. She may not be as naturally versatile as the actual Avatar, but Elsa makes a good stand-in for the role within her own world.</p>
      <p><i>Arriving Nov. 22, Disney's </i>Frozen 2<i> reunites directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck and producer Del Vecho with voice actors Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, Jonathan Groff and Josh Gad. Returning musical talents include Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez.</i></p>
