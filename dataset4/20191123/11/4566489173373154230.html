      <h1>Hong Kong protests slacken ahead of closely watched poll</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:30:13+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author">Xinqi SU (AFP)</a></address>
      <p>Hong Kong's protest movement called on Saturday for citizens not to disrupt district council elections in which pro-democracy parties hope to send a message to the city's Beijing-backed government.</p>
      <p>There have been no major rallies or violent clashes between police and protesters in the run-up to Sunday's district polls, a rare respite for a city roiled by nearly six months of political unrest.</p>
      <p>Amid concerns that violence could cause authorities to delay the polls, first-time voters have been advised online to avoid spoiling their ballots, while protest forums have urged an orderly ballot.</p>
      <p>Postings by pro-democracy users on the popular board LiHKG urged voters to go to polling stations early and for supporters "not to jeopardise the election".</p>
      <p>Polls open Sunday morning as the semi-autonomous city of 7.5 million.</p>
      <p>The district council polls have in the past generated little passion, dominated by candidates allied to the China-backed government with a remit over more mundane matters as rubbish collections and planning decisions.</p>
      <p>But with protests coursing through the city, pro-democracy candidates are hoping to make a statement to Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the pro-Beijing government, which have refused to concede to democracy demands.</p>
      <p>The poll to choose 452 councillors across 18 districts is the closest voters in Hong Kong get to direct representation -- but turnout is usually unremarkable.</p>
      <p>Nearly 400,000 new voters have registered, however, which is widely interpreted as a positive sign for the pro-democracy camp.</p>
      <p>An unprecedented police presence will be deployed at polling stations and on the city streets on Sunday to prevent any drama.</p>
      <p>- 'Every vote matters' -</p>
      <p>Lam's Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung called on citizens to let the polls proceed smoothly.</p>
      <p>"If you create massive chaos or carry out unlawful deeds it will be difficult to hold a fair election," Cheung said.</p>
      <p>"It's a real democratic exercise. I really want people to treasure it."</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's political unrest billowed out in June in opposition to an extradition bill to China.</p>
      <p>Although the bill was eventually withdrawn, the movement snowballed into wider calls for democracy and investigations into alleged police brutality.</p>
      <p>Protester Chow Pak-kwan, a 21-year-old who lost a kidney and part of his liver after being shot by a traffic police officer earlier this month, on Saturday echoed the calls for "peaceful" elections.</p>
      <p>"I hope Hong Kong people can cast their votes to earn more democracy in a peaceful way," Chow Pak-kwan, masked and dressed in the black colours of the city's protest movement, told reporters.</p>
      <p>"Every vote matters."</p>
      <p>In a sign of mistrust between much of the public and the authorities, polling authorities on Saturday issued a statement to knock down rumours that facial recognition technology would be installed at polling stations.</p>
      <p>The district polls remain the city's freest. In contrast, members of the city's legislature are elected by a mix of popular vote and industry groups stacked with Beijing loyalists.</p>
      <p>The city's chief executive is chosen by a similarly pro-establishment committee.</p>
      <p>Political analysts expect pro-democracy candidates to make gains in the district councils, but to still fall well short of a majority of the 452 slots.</p>
