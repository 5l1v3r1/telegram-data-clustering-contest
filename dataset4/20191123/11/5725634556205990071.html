      <h1>Livent Corp.: A Heavily Discounted Lithium Producer With High Growth Potential From The Electric Vehicle Market</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:40:28+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author">Harrison Schwartz</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>After entering a bubble last year, lithium prices have collapsed due to a glut in the market.</li>
        <li>To meet rapidly rising lithium demand for electric vehicles, most lithium producers are working to ambitiously expand production.</li>
        <li>As long as 2020 and thereafter EV sales estimates are roughly accurate, the lithium glut is likely to decline.</li>
        <li>I believe that Livent Corp. will be the primary benefactor of another potential bull market in lithium as it has the highest profit margins and the most undervalued by most metrics.</li>
        <li>An expected rise in crude oil prices could further catalyze EV sales growth over the coming five years.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Due to the rise in electric vehicle manufacturing, lithium has had a wild ride over the past few years. Most high capacity batteries used in EVs rely on lithium and Model 3 demand from Tesla (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA">TSLA</a>) (as well as competitors) caused a price bubble in the lithium market last year that has since fully reversed.</p>
      <p>Take a look below:</p>

      <p>As you can see, the trend in declines has slowed in recent months and lithium is now around its mid-point price since 2011. A significant reason for the drop was a huge slowdown in Tesla Model 3 (as well as other EV) sales early this year that has since partially recovered. While I am not convinced that the Tesla "Cyber Truck" will meet expected demand, EV sales stability, as well as the higher general need for improved batteries, will continue to keep the lithium market stable.</p>
      <p>While they were exorbitantly expensive last year, many lithium producers are actually pretty cheap this year. My favorite of which is Livent Corp. (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LTHM">LTHM</a>). The company generates higher margins than its peers and has a slightly lower valuation by most metrics. Livent's management has positioned the company to fully capitalize on EV sales growth and has been expanding production capacity.</p>
      <p>Now, that lithium's price has stabilized, it may be a good time to make a long-term investment in Livent.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Operational Overview</b>
      </p>
      <p>The company obtains most of its raw lithium from brine operations in the Salar del Hombre Muerto salt pan in Argentina. Brine lithium is generally regarded as the cheapest way to produce lithium and the company benefits tremendously from this resource.</p>
      <p>After extraction, the company manufactures lithium into lithium hydroxide, butyllithium, lithium metal, and lithium carbonate which are used in batteries, industrial items, pharmaceuticals, and various chemicals.</p>
      <p>Take a look at its revenue breakdown by segment in 2018:</p>
      <figure>

      <p>As you can see, its primary focus is in energy storage and its primary product, lithium hydroxide, is expected to have the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/lithium-hydroxide-monohydrate-market-size-demand-growth-opportunities-top-key-players-and-forecast-to-2024-2019-04-02">fastest</a> demand growth for batteries over the coming years due to its superior battery qualities to carbonate:</p>

      <p><a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/453302215/files/doc_financials/2018/LTHM002AR_AR_2018_Web.pdf">According to its annual report</a>, in 2018, the company extracted and processed 17 kMT of lithium hydroxide and 15 kMT of lithium carbonate and has projects in place to expand those figures to 55 kMT of hydroxide and 60 kMT of carbonate by 2025. As long as prices remain stable and it can reach this aggressive target, the company may see its revenue triple by 2025.</p>
      <p>It is currently investing around $46M per year in growth CAPEX projects to make this happen. Though, it is important to realize that LTHM's competitors also have aggressive growth targets and, if demand does not grow as expected, could cause continued oversupply.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Strong Comparative Fundamentals</b>
      </p>
      <p>The $1B market cap company is a bit smaller than its peers FMC Corp. (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FMC">FMC</a>) (which formerly owned Livent) and Sociedad Quimica (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SQM">SQM</a>) which have a market caps of $12B and $6B, respectively, though it is much larger than Lithium Americas (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LAC">LAC</a>) at $250M. This gives Livent a higher, but still healthy, level of volatility and growth potential.</p>
      <p>Although all of the major players have seen sales fall this year due to lower lithium prices, they are still able to generate earnings. Take a look at how the PE ratio of each company compares since LTHM was made public:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/22/saupload_e5855cfa4427e7b9f62a1f1d5fb79842.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Data by YCharts</p>
      <p>As you can see, the company is significantly cheaper than SQM and, by this metric, is trading in line with its former parent company.</p>
      <p>While nearly as expensive from a PE standpoint, the company is far cheaper from a price-to-book-value perspective:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/22/saupload_5324e8741557d0be1bafcbad510524f1.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Data by <a href="http://ycharts.com/">YCharts</a></p>
      <p>A similar trend indicating LTHM's undervaluation is also seen in EV/EBITDA and price-to-sales metrics. Clearly, investors are currently placing a bit of a risk premium on Livent.</p>
      <p>While Livent is certainly ambitious in its expansion plans, it currently has the<b> least</b> amount of leverage compared to peers:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/22/saupload_b6cf23691ccf0e0e1731965c5da65fda.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Data by YCharts</p>
      <p>Even more, Livent consistently generates the highest profit margin compared to peers:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/22/saupload_0be6c5cfd91d99828a92bce425ced3ac.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Data by YCharts</p>
      <p>Overall, Livent appears to be trading at a discount of around 25-50% given that its, cleaner balance sheet and high earnings stability compared to peers. While Lithium Americas is cheaper by some metrics, the company currently loses exorbitant amounts of money. In my opinion, Livent offers the best trade-off between risk and reward and, due to its growth potential, deserves a PE ratio closer to the 20-25X range.</p>
      <p>The question is, will demand meet expectations? If not, all of these companies could be headed for an even worse glut.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Keep An Eye on Vehicle Sales</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since all major lithium producers are working to expand the capacity to capitalize on higher demand from the EV industry, it is paramount that the EV industry grows as expected.</p>
      <p>If a recession occurs over the next five years, which is statistically very likely, it could worsen the current glut in the market as EV sales would likely fall considerably. That said, high growth technology has a tendency to be less impacted by recessions since they lack broad market share (like smartphones in 2008-2009).</p>
      <p>Many of the EV sales estimates today are a bit "too good to be true". In 2018, the IEA predicted that EV sales would climb from 3 million to 125 million<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/30/electric-vehicles-will-grow-from-3-million-to-125-million-by-2030-iea.html"> by 2030</a>. More realistically, <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/research/electric-vehicles">JPMorgan estimates</a> 25 million by 2025. Most of this growth depends on higher demand in China and secondarily in Europe as well as new less niche non-Tesla models.</p>
      <p>In all likelihood, 2020 will be the year Tesla loses much of its huge lead in the market. Honda, Volvo, Mercedes, Ford, and quite a few other major automobile manufacturers will introduce their electric vehicles. If these vehicles can successfully build a brand, it is likely that long-term EV sales estimates will come to fruition.</p>
      <p>One often forgotten potential positive catalyst for EVs and batteries is the price of gasoline. The initial boom in hybrid vehicles in the late 2000s was spurred by the extremely high gasoline prices at the time. Gas remains cheap today, but for reasons outside of the scope of this article (primarily falling production growth in the Permian basin), it is very feasible that gas prices will return to their 2008 highs or higher by 2025 (when Livent plans to have fully expanded production). If oil and gasoline prices spike, it would likely drastically boost global demand for hybrid and electric vehicles and perhaps prove the IEA correct with its ambitious 2030 target.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Bottom Line</b>
      </p>
      <p>While a glut persists in the lithium market, renewed price stability in lithium indicates that the glut may be falling. Going into 2020, demand for lithium is likely to rise as many new 2020 EV models will enter the market.</p>
      <p>While all of the major lithium producers plan to raise production, Livent is particularly ambitious in taking advantage of the opportunity and, as long as electric vehicle sales forecasts meet expectations (or other new demand factors arise), there is more likely to be a net shortage of lithium than a glut.</p>
      <p>Today, Livent is very cheap not only compared to its historical valuation but also when compared to its peers. It has very low production costs, a clean balance sheet, strong growth positioning, and comes at a more-than-reasonable low price today. I have high expectations for the company and give it a "buy" rating with a price target of $15 by this time next year.</p>
