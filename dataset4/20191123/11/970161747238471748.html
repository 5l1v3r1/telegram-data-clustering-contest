      <p>Sir Alex Ferguson admits <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> are going through a ‘challenging’ spell under <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer enjoyed a superb start to his managerial career at Old Trafford but results and performances dropped off after he was named as Jose Mourinho’s permanent successor.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils have endured a poor start to the 2019-20 campaign, winning just a third of their Premier League fixtures to sit seventh in the table after 12 matches.</p>

      <p>Manchester United’s current struggles stand in stark contract to the monumental success Ferguson enjoyed at the club, with the Scot winning 13 league titles and two Champions Leagues in a remarkable spell at the club.</p>

      <p>Asked what the future holds for his former club, Ferguson told Manchester United’s official website: ‘Well, we’ve got a great structure at the club.</p>
      <p>‘We’ve got a lot of good young players coming through, that’s never changed.</p>
      <p>‘There’s always that challenge, and what’s happening at the moment is a challenge, but with a bit of luck – and a bit of perseverance – we’ll sort it out.’</p>
      <p>United’s struggles under Solskjaer have sparked fears that the best young talent will be reluctant to join the Premier League giants but Ferguson insists this is not a concern.</p>
      <p>‘The young players at United are doing well,’ he told talkSPORT. ‘It’s a good set up at United.</p>

      <p>‘For any young kid going there, it’s a great club to go to. And I think England are producing great young players who are representing their country and that can only be a good thing.</p>
      <p>‘Hopefully Scotland can follow that!’</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Manchester United travel to Premier League new-boys Sheffield United, who are currently fifth in the top-flight.</p>
