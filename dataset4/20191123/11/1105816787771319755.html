      <p><b>LAHORE  : </b>The 36<sup>th</sup> death anniversary of legendary Pakistani film actor Waheed Murad is being observed today. In this connection, the All Pakistan Waheedi Club has organised different kinds of events in memory of the cinema icon and his contributions to the industry.</p>
      <p>Murad, who became known as the ‘Chocolate Hero’ of Pakistan, passed away on November 23, 1983, at 45 years of age. He was not only a gifted actor but also enjoyed quite a reputation as a director, producer and scriptwriter.</p>
      <p>Born in Sialkot on October 2, 1938, Murad migrated to Karachi seeking higher education and earned a Master’s degree in English from the University of Karachi. His father ran a film company and so, the actor was introduced to cinema at a very young age. He subsequently began his film career as a producer with 1961’s <i>Insaan Badalta Hai</i>, followed by <i>Jab Se Dekha Hai Tumhe</i>.</p>

      <p>But it wasn’t until Zeba Begum, the top female actor of the era, advised him to try his hand at acting that Murad decided to come in front of the camera. His first film <i>Aulaad</i> (1962) proved to be a super hit at the box office and so started what would be a long, decorated film career that many still aspire to emulate today.</p>
      <p><i>Aulaad</i> went on to compete at the Nigar Awards for that year and firmly established Murad as the first choice of film-makers across the country. Thereafter, he played the male lead in <i>Heera Aur Pathar</i> (1964), which also became a hit. Then, in 1966, he acted in and produced <i>Armaan</i> which broke all previous records of Pakistani cinema, playing in theatres for 75 weeks. Murad received two Nigar Awards for the film as well.</p>
      <p>The late artist has other mega hits like <i>Doraha, Devar Bhabi, Ehsaan, Yahan Tum Wahan Hum, Usse Dekha Usse Chaha</i> and <i>Dushman</i> to his credit, wherein he worked with all the leading female stars of his time, including Neelo, Shamim Ara, Zeba, Aliya, Shabnum, Sangeeta, Kaveeta and Babra Shariff.  In total, he worked on 124 films in his career.</p>

      <p>Considering this, it is no wonder that those who worked with him, as well as those who did not, still remember Murad with utmost love. “There has not been and never will be another Waheed Murad in Pakistan or even in Bollywood,” actor Durdana Rahman told <i>The Express Tribune</i>. “He was beautiful, both inside and out – a great human being whose name will forever be associated with all the biggest hits of the yesteryears.”</p>
      <p>Actor Ghulam Mahiuddin added, “Waheed Murad was a talented and versatile actor, enriched with all the qualities needed for success the entertainment world. His era was undoubtedly the golden era of Lollywood and his films are guidelines for the ones being made these days.”</p>
      <p>Muhammad Sajjad, the general secretary of the All Pakistan Waheedi Club highlighted how he has been observing Murad’s death anniversary for many years. “This year, we have planned different events to remember the legend that he was. A cake-cutting ceremony will be held at Lakshmi Chowk. Then various showbiz personalities will gather to pay tribute to the one and only Waheed Murad.”</p>
