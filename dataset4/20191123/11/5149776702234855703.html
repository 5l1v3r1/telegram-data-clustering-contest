      <h1>Nearly one in three women in Nottingham did not attend routine smear test last year</h1>
      <h2>In recent years the rate of women having smear tests has been falling</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:08:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:08</time> by <a rel="author">Alice Cachia, Phoebe Ram</a></address>
      <p>New figures have revealed nearly a third of eligible women in Nottingham did not have a smear test last year.</p>
      <p>The numbers, published by the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nhs">NHS</a>, show that 82,600 women should have had a screening during a 12 month period from April 2018 to April 2019.</p>
      <p>But 24,863 (or 30.1%) did not had the test.</p>
      <p>It means nearly one in three eligible women have missed out on what could be a life-saving screening.</p>
      <p>A smear test or cervical screening checks the health of a woman's cervix and can help to prevent cancer.</p>
      <p>Anyone aged 25 to 64 who is eligible should be invited to attend a screening by letter.</p>
      <p>Those aged between 25 and 49 should have been screened within the past 3.5 years while those aged between 50 and 64 should have been screened within the past 5.5 years.</p>
      <p>During the screening, which is free and takes less than five minutes, a small sample of cells is collected and tested for any changes.</p>
      <p>Finding abnormalities early means they can be monitored and treated so they do not get a chance to turn into cervical cancer.</p>
      <p>There was a spike in screening following the death of high-profile celebrity Jade Goody after her battle with cervical cancer in 2009.</p>
      <p>However, in recent years the rate of women having smear tests has been falling.</p>

      <p>While the rate in Nottingham is down slightly from 30.2% the year before, it is the second-highest since 2013/14, when figures at a local authority level were first published.</p>
      <p>It means just 69.9% of women had been screened as of 2018/19 - well below the national target of 80.0%.</p>
      <p>It is the second lowest figure for the East Midlands after Leicester which had a rate 63.6%.</p>
      <p>The rest of Nottinghamshire, not including the city, had a better coverage rate of 78.6%.</p>
      <p>Dr Nicole Atkinson, GP at Eastwood Medical Centre, and Clinical Lead for Nottingham West CCG, said: “Cervical screening is a vital tool in our fight against cancer, and across Greater Nottingham we’re working hard to increase the uptake of smear test appointments.</p>
      <p>"In some areas we are above the national average for uptake, but in others there is more work to do.<br/><br/>"Women aged 25-49 who are registered with a GP surgery are invited for cervical screening every three years, while women aged 50-64 are invited every five years.</p>
      <p>"I would urge all women to make sure they respond to their smear test reminders and attend their appointment; the test is free and usually takes less than five minutes.<br/><br/>"Simply put, cervical screening can save lives."</p>
      <p>Across England, 15.2 million women aged between 25 and 64 should had a smear test done as of 2018/19.</p>
      <p>But 4.3 million of these women had not - a rate of 28.1%.</p>
      <p>While that was a slight improvement from 28.6% the year before, it remains the second-highest rate on modern record.</p>
      <p>Comparable figures go back as far as 2010/11, when 24.9% of women missed out on the screening.</p>
