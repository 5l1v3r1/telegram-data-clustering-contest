      <p>Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy, the other day, announced that Andhra Pradesh could not afford to build the capital indicating that Amaravati will have to go. Farmers who have given their lands are in a distress and are gearing up for the big fight against the State Government now.</p>
      <p>It is already known that some farmers have approached the court against the shifting or downsizing of the capital alleging that it is the breach of the contract signed by the State Government for the Landpooling farmers. Now, the farmers are gearing up to stage Hunger Strike Protests from December 9th which marks the beginning of the Winter session of the Assembly.</p>
      <p>The farmers are demanding that the Chief Minister <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/politics/jagan-really-serious-about-the-troubled-finances/">YS Jagan Mohan Reddy</a> will have to give clarity on this issue. The farmers say that if plots are given to them without developing other facilities, they would be of no use. YSR Congress Government has brought every work in the Capital to a Stand-still.</p>
      <p>“Jagan never committed to continuing Amaravati. He said so in many interviews as well before the election. Even the Capital Region also overwhelmingly voted for YSR Congress. Farmers are well aware of what they are doing and there is no use ruing on that now,” a political expert said. It is known that more than 22,000 farmers have given more than 33,000 acres of land to the Capital in Land Pooling.</p>
