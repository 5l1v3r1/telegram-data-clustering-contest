      <h1>Bottas admits Red Bull Racing "are better than us on the straights now"</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> driver <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/valtteri-bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a> has praised the progress that has been made two garages down at <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Aston Martin Red Bull Racing</a>, admitting the Bulls are quicker on the straights now than his own team.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The best example of this is the end of the Brazilian Grand Prix, when <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> drag-raced <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/pierre-gasly">Pierre Gasly</a> to the finishing line after getting a better exit out of the final corner.</p>
      <p>However, the Honda-powered<a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/toro-rosso"> Toro Rosso</a> held on as the two drivers crossed the line within a tenth of each other as Gasly claimed his first-ever podium by finishing second.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> won the race as well, meaning it was the first Honda one-two since Gerhard Berger and Ayrton Senna in 1991. Bottas, who retired from last weekend's Grand Prix with engine issues, praised his rivals and how far they've come since the start of the season.</p>
      <p><i>“We knew they would be strong, but I think they were even stronger than we expected,” </i>the 30-year-old was quoted by <a href="https://www.racefans.net/2019/11/23/bottas-red-bull-quicker-than-mercedes-on-the-straights-now/"><i>RaceFans.net</i></a>.<i> </i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Especially in a straight line. They have a good car in the corners now but in a straight line they are better than us now. It used to be pretty similar to us.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Red Bull typically end seasons stronger than they start them, although the progress Honda have made on the power unit side of things could carry over into 2020. When asked for an early prediction for next year, Bottas expected close racing.</p>

      <p><i>“If you look at the beginning of the season to the end of the season, I think Red Bull has made some solid progress,"</i> the seven-time Grand Prix winner continued.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"So if you would draw that graph till next year, yes.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“But obviously it’s a completely new season with a new car. I’m sure every team has made progress, including us, with their new car that is going to be there in testing.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“So it’s impossible to predict, really. Everyone starts from zero, even though there are not many regulation changes it’s still new cars.”</i>
