      <p>COLUMBIA, S.C. — Kamala Harris has officially signed her papers to be a candidate in South Carolina’s Democratic presidential primary.</p>
      <p>Harris signed documents just ahead of a Saturday night round table discussion in Columbia. The California senator is stumping in the state in what her campaign is calling a “Black Women’s Weekend of Action,” a trip focused on the contingency that comprises the Democratic Party’s most consistent supporters.</p>
      <p>Harris joins several other candidates who have filed for the Feb. 29 primary in South Carolina, the first Southern state to vote. Former Vice-President Joe Biden signed his paperwork Friday during a stop in Abbeville. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Pete Buttigieg, Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, have already filed.</p>
      <p>The deadline is Dec. 4.</p>
