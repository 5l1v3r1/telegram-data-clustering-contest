      <p><b>The President, PenOp</b>, Aderonke Adedeji, said the issue of the role of pension funds in economic development had moved into the focus of public attention, particularly with regard to Nigeria’s growing need for long-term capital.</p>
      <p><b>She explained that successful mobilisation</b> of pension fund assets for the economic growth of any nation was an essential policy objective.</p>
      <p>She said, <i>“For the first time, our country can now boast of a long-term funding base and the impact to date has included the funding of the government and government projects, development of the capital market, as well as increased foreign development inflows.”</i></p>
      <p><b>While this is positive</b>, she added, a note of caution must be raised in view of recent agitations to access the funds for infrastructure.</p>
      <p><b>Backstory:</b> <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2019/10/07/pfas-earn-n1-69-trillion-as-roi/">Nairametrics</a> had reported that the PFAs have recorded a profit of N1.69 trillion as return on investments made from investing workers’ pension contributions.</p>
