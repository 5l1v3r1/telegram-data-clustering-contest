      <h1>Stewart Milne's Aberdeen highs and lows as chairman steps aside after two decades</h1>
      <h2>The chairman will step aside in favour of Dave Cormack as he concentrates on his other businesses.</h2>

      <p>It was announced yesterday that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> chairman Stewart Milne is stepping down after 21 years at the helm.</p>
      <p>The Dons' majority shareholder will be replaced by Dave Cormack, with the move seeing Milne take more of a background role.</p>
      <p>He's been a constant in Scottish football for over two decades, and here are Milne's high and low points from his time as Pittodrie kingpin.</p>

      <p>Since <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stewart-milne">Milne</a> became chairman of Aberdeen in 1998 there have been more misses than hits when it comes to appointing managers.</p>
      <p>Ebbe Skovdahl, Steve Paterson and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/mark-mcghee">Mark McGhee</a> didn't exactly cover themselves in glory, though Jimmy Calderwood did take the Dons into Europe for three consecutive seasons.</p>
      <p>When it was decided that Craig Brown's time was up there was some trepidation over who Milne and the board would appoint, but they got it right with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/derek-mcinnes">McInnes</a> .</p>
      <p>Almost 300 games later Aberdeen are regulars in European competition, have finished second in the division on several occasions and finally ended their trophy drought. Speaking of which...</p>

        <b>League Cup win</b>

      </p>
      <p>Under Milne's tenure Aberdeen finally ended a nearly two decade wait for a trophy, beating Inverness on penalties to lift the League Cup in 2014.</p>
      <p>The game wasn't a classic, a 0-0 draw over 120 minutes, but in front of over 40,000 Dons fans at Celtic Park McInnes and his men were finally able to lift silverware.</p>
      <p>Milne was on the board for the previous League Cup win in 1996 but can claim this trophy from his time as chairman and majority shareholder.</p>

        <b>New stadium and training ground</b>

      <p>Milne's greatest legacy will surely be finally delivering Aberdeen a training ground of their own, as well as taking the club away from Pittodrie.</p>
      <p>The former was much-needed, with the state-of-the-art Cormack Park opening earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Relocating from the club's spiritual home has proven more divisive, with some fans concerned by the idea of playing outside of the city limits, but there's no question that the Kingsford stadium will be the house that Milne built.</p>

        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p>The phrase "seething meltdown" wouldn't be inappropriate to describe Milne's reaction when a plan to move to a new league structure of 12-12-18 failed to pass the SPL board.</p>
      <p>Among those opposed had been St Mirren chairman Stewart Gilmour, and his Aberdeen counterpart gave him both barrels after the Hampden vote.</p>
      <p>Milne fumed: "I'm very angry because I think today we have let down Scottish football.</p>
      <p>"St Mirren Football Club have really got to pose themselves the question: why are they prepared to put the rest of Scottish football in jeopardy just because of their own selfish interests?</p>
      <p>"This is a massive opportunity that has been blown, particularly on the whims of an individual.</p>
      <p>"In that room, we've got to be in there with the interests of our club but we've got a wider responsibility for the SPL as an organisation and also wider Scottish football.</p>
      <p>"None of that was displayed by Stewart Gilmour and St Mirren Football Club."</p>
      <p>Not his finest hour.</p>

        <b>F****** penalties</b>

      </figure>
      <p>There aren't many club chairmen who can boast of the dubious honour of having had an OFCOM complaint made about them.</p>
      <p>Following the aforementioned League Cup triumph over Inverness, Milne was asked by BBC Scotland what he had made of the match.</p>
      <p>His immortal reply was: "Fantastic. 19 years, 120 minutes and then f****** penalties.</p>
      <p>“Penalties, my apologies. I hope there was no-one listening.”</p>
      <p>The clip went down a storm with Aberdeen fans but one listener was offended by such robust language pre-watershed and complained to OFCOM.</p>
      <p>The broadcasting authority launched an investigation and Milne was eventually cleared, despite it being ruled that he was in breach of the regulations.</p>
      <p>While OFCOM ruled that the language was inappropriate, it took into account that the interview was live and unscripted, and that both Milne and the presenter had apologised.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Aberdeen hadn't won a trophy since 1996 when Jimmy Calderwood's side reached the semi-final of the Scottish Cup in the 2007-08 season.</p>
      <p>All they had to do to reach the final was beat second tier Queen of the South but the Dons ended up on the wrong end of one of the craziest games in recent memory.</p>
      <p>The Doonhamers took the lead three times inside the first hour but were pegged back each time, with Andy Considine making it 3-3 in the 59th minute.</p>
      <p>Just a minute later John Stewart headed in what would prove to be the winner, the fifth goal in 11 minutes of action.</p>
