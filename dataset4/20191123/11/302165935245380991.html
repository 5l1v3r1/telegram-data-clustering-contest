      <p>IPOH, Nov 23 — Communities are capable of becoming agents of change and game changers if given systematic guidance and training, said Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail.</p>
      <p>Dr Wan Azizah, who is also Women, Family and Community Development Minister, said a responsible community could also help the government address local issues such as on social and welfare.</p>
      <p>“I believe the role of the community is very important in helping the people, especially the ministry’s target group, to continue living in peace and prosperity.</p>
      <p>“The Women, Family and Community Development Ministry through the Social Welfare Department (JKM) supports the concept of community-based approach as a way to assist the people in improving the quality of life,” she said at the launching of the Perak-level “Program Santuni Rakyat” (PSR) in Meru Raya here today.</p>
      <p>The text of her speech was read out by Deputy Women, Family and Community Development Minister Hannah Yeoh.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Dr Wan Azizah said as of October 31, 134,674 women had registered with the Suri Incentive Scheme (i-Suri), of which 7,382 of them were from Perak.</p>
      <p>“I urge all eligible housewives out there to take advantage of this scheme and seize the opportunity to guarantee your social security in the future,” she said.</p>
      <p>On the PSR, Dr Wan Azizah said it was a link between the community, especially those in need, and various government agencies, corporate sector and non-governmental organisations, which were ready to provide assistance and services for the well-being of the people.</p>
      <p>She said the PSR in Ipoh was a continuation of a series of PSR being implemented from last year in Selangor and in Johor, Pahang, Sarawak, Kedah and Melaka this year. — Bernama</p>
