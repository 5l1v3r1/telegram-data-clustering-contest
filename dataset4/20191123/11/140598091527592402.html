      <p>This dish is perfect for sharing, and you can use whatever vegetables you like. I often eat it as it is, but some fat maftoul (giant couscous) would go very well with it.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>35 minutes, plus resting time | <b>Cooking time: </b>1 hour 5 minutes </p>
      <h3>SERVES </h3>
      <p>four</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 chicken, weighing about 1.5kg</li>
        <li>½ tsp fine salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>700g butternut squash</li>
        <li>500g small red onions</li>
        <li>120ml olive oil, plus 3 tbsp for cooking</li>
        <li>500g small tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>2 small lemons, halved</li>
        <li>5 tbsp pomegranate molasses, or as needed</li>
        <li>30g fresh mint</li>
        <li>30g fresh coriander</li>
        <li>200ml plain yogurt (goat’s, sheep’s or Greek)</li>
        <li>Seeds from 1 small pomegranate</li>
        <li>50g toasted hazelnuts, chopped</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Spatchcock the chicken by using strong kitchen scissors to cut down either side of the back bone (remove this and save for stock) and flatten the chicken out like a knock-kneed sunbather (your butcher can do this for you).</li>
        <li>Rub the chicken with the salt and cumin, and ideally leave it on a plate to come to room temperature for a couple of hours, covered with an upturned bowl.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C fan/Gas 6.</li>
        <li> Cut the squash in half and scoop out the seedy guts, spreading them on a baking sheet. These can be cooked in the oven, as they are, for 15 or 20 minutes until dark golden, then eaten as a snack.</li>
        <li>Cut the squash into wedges – there’s no need to peel it.</li>
        <li>Peel the onions and cut them into eighths through the roots.</li>
        <li>Line a large roasting tin with a sheet of non-stick parchment. Add the squash and onions, plus two tablespoons of oil. Toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Arrange the tomatoes, cut-side up, amongst the other veg and pop the lemon halves in too.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with another tablespoon of oil and two tablespoons of the pomegranate molasses, rubbing it into the tomatoes and veg. Sprinkle with salt.</li>
        <li>Nestle the chicken in the tin, skin-side up. Rub this with another tablespoonful of pomegranate molasses.</li>
        <li>Roast for 40 minutes, until the chicken is barely done (it will continue to cook as it sits) then lift the chicken on to a warm dish and allow to rest for 20 minutes. If the vegetables need to brown up a bit more, put them back in the hot oven. If not, turn the oven off and leave the veg to keep warm with the door ajar.</li>
        <li>Strip the leaves of mint and coriander from the stalks and chop them roughly. Mix with the remaining oil, adding a bit extra if necessary to make a spooning consistency, add the last two tablespoonfuls of pomegranate molasses and plenty of salt and pepper. Taste and add more molasses if you like.</li>
        <li> Serve the chicken with the vegetables and juices piled around, and some of the yogurt and herbs spooned over, and the pomegranate seeds and hazelnuts tumbled on top. I might even trickle a little more pomegranate molasses over.</li>
        <li>Put the rest of the yogurt and herb sauce in bowls to pass around, and encourage guests to squeeze over the caramelised lemon halves.</li>
