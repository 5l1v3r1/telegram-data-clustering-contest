      <p>Just when you thought <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/05/robert-pattinson-is-your-new-batman"><i>The Batman</i></a> could not possible cram any more characters into its cast, along comes this bit of Friday afternoon news: John Turturro has signed on to play Batman foe Carmine Falcone.</p>
      <p><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/the-batman-john-turturro-carmine-falcone-1203413802/">The news was shared in Variety</a> and confirmed by <i>The Batman</i> director Matt Reeves on Twitter, using a gif of what’s probably the best-known role—soon to be reprised in the Turturro-directed <i>The Jesus Rolls</i>—in Turturro’s long and varied career.</p>

      <p>Turturro, as Gotham City crime boss Carmine Falcone, joins newcomer Jayme Lawson as a political candidate who somehow enters the story (read more about that below), as well as <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/reports-andy-serkis-and-colin-farrell-could-be-batmans-new-alfred-and-penguin">Andy Serkis as Alfred</a>, <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/reports-andy-serkis-and-colin-farrell-could-be-batmans-new-alfred-and-penguin">Colin Farrell as the Penguin</a>, <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/matt-reeves-batman-has-officially-found-its-jim-gordon">Jeffrey Wright as Jim Gordon</a>, <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/10/report-robert-pattinsons-batman-will-fight-paul-danos-riddler">Paul Dano as the Riddler</a>, <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/10/zo-kravitz-will-play-catwoman-in-matt-reeves-batman-movie">Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman</a>, and, of course, <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/06/report-so-robert-pattinson-is-definitely-maybe-batman-now">Robert Pattinson as the title character</a>.</p>
      <p>At this point, that’s gotta be just about all the leading characters, right? Is there anyone currently missing that you hope ends up making the cut? Variety notes that <i>The Batman</i> may well begin filming very soon, though nothing’s official yet—except its targeted release date of June 25, 2021.</p>
