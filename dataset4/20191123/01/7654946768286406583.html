      <h1>Cuomo’s posturing on Long Island natural gas crisis is a real jobs killer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T01:48:11+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 01:48</time> by <a rel="author">Post Editorial Board</a></address>
      <p>It looks like all of New York will end up paying for Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s scapegoating of National Grid for the Long Island natural-gas shortage that he caused: <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/newsletters/politico-new-york-energy/2019/11/19/more-pressure-on-national-grid-330140">Moody’s Investor Service just put out an alert</a> that all investor-owned utilities operating in New York now face new “credit-negative” risks.</p>
      <p>This accompanies Moody’s launch of a credit-rating “downgrade review” for KeySpan Gas East Corp. and Brooklyn Union Gas Co., both National Grid-owned — a review mandated by the gov’s written threat last week to revoke National Grid’s license to operate in New York.</p>
      <p>Moody’s doesn’t see “license revocation as a likely outcome” for any New York utilities, but Cuomo’s over-the-top threat still “represents a weakening of the consistency and predictability of New York’s utility regulatory environment.” In other words: Who knows how far Cuomo might go?</p>
      <p>Especially when the utilities are supposed to answer to the independent-by-law Public Service Commission — which Cuomo is now treating like just another arm of his office.</p>
      <p>Notably, he last year had the PSC threaten to yank the license of Charter Communications (Spectrum cable), extorting it into making concessions to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.</p>
      <p>It’s all the more reason for businesses to think three times before investing in New York — and a guarantee that the state will continue to lag the nation in job growth.</p>
