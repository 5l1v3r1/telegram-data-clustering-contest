      <p>THESE days, and even in the past, it can be said that surviving when your relationship breaks up can be a very difficult time. It is indeed a painful process of grief and sorrow.  Losing a boyfriend/girlfriend or a husband/wife can can be likened to a heart  that is  about to burst  from severe pain.  It is not uncommon to  see  people exhibit   depression or hear  about  attempts at suicide, self-harm or harm to others at the end of a “wonderful” relationship.</p>
      <p>Relationship issues, from my experience, are one of the reasons people seek counsel and, often times ,go through depression. People   cope with breakup at various levels. Unfortunately, our society does not properly educate people on how to deal with FAILURE, much less of heart break. I will do my best to explain techniques you can use to cope in healthy ways, when it comes to matters of the heart although  the healing period cannot be determined. You can only do the best to accept the situation, re strategize and then move on.</p>
      <p>Let me also warn that my tips will NOT stop you from experiencing pain of loss. They will only help give you clarity and guide you through the process of loss as fast as your heart and feelings can manage it . And of course still enable you enjoy better relationship with others.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1.Try not to fight the feeling of grief</b>
      </p>
      <p>Break ups sometimes come  with severe negative feelings: your head spins with unimaginable thoughts most of the time. Such  feelings include  sadness, anger, confusion, resentment, jealousy, fear and regret, and suicide being the worst of them all.  If you try to ignore or suppress these feelings, you will only prolong the process, and sometimes get totally stuck trying to overcome the pain.   As hard as it is, you will not be able to avoid this pain;but  realize that these feelings, over time, will reduce. It starts with shock, sometimes denial, anger, depression and after a short while, or long while ,acceptance. Ensure the acceptance does not come with bitterness.  Severe grief feels like it will last forever, but I can tell you from experience that it will and can never last forever.</p>

          <b>Look for avenues to express your feelings</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Talking about your feelings on  the break-up is an equally powerful way to cope with the grief arising therefrom . Friends, family members can help ease the pain, which will help one come to some new understanding and relieve your pain. Several perspectives of trusted people who can give you a shoulder to lean on can guide you on how to discover your feelings and survive them. The key point is to make sure you don’t isolate yourself and withdraw from those who can support you and those who truly love you.</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="3">
          <b>Document your feelings</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Even after you have spoken to others and cried on a shoulder, writing down how you feel is therapeutic.It helps guide your feelings and thoughts  because the fact is that people may not always be available.You may also not like the idea of confiding in people at the beginning. Some feelings are too deep to share, so the act of writing it out can still help you heal. At some point the pain will be in the  past and no longer in the  present. 4.  Break-ups are sometimes out of your control</p>
      <p>Many relationships especially in dating end up in break up. This is the nature of life itself.What we need is someone who will  complement us, bearing in mind that no one is perfect. You need to keep searching. With this mindset you won’t be ready to kill yourself if one or several don’t work out as planned. You may have to try several times to get the man or woman of your dream. If at first you don’t succeed, pick yourself up and try again.</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="5">
          <b>Don’t forget who you are</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Care of self is a technique which states that you must ensure that your needs are met, despite the fact that you may be feeling upset and depressed due to the break-up.  You may not feel like eating but do it anyway, and try to make some healthy choices in what you eat.Don’t binge  or starve yourself or go on pain inflicting fasts because you are upset.It is better you are alive to love again, than die and your ex now finds true love.  Give yourself time to rest, particularly since this may be difficult for you.  Sleep deprivation will only increase your pain.Start an exercise, join a keto club, join a gym, just do something.</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="6">
          <b>Get your life back</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Going through a break-up can disrupt your life. The best is to continue your basic routines to, at least, give you a sense of normalcy;routines that can keep your mind busy.Don’t just sit and feel miserable:get up, move on and live your life</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="7">
          <b>You are special, treat yourself that way</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now is the time to pamper yourself.  You need to do something that will actively make yourself feel better. Go to a special restaurant, movie, club, take a friend who can keep you company and engage you in good conversation.Buy new books to  read, improve your mind and you will find that your thoughts will gradually start drifting to better things.</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="8">
          <b>Shit happens, get over it</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>You will not get back to full capacity immediately, definitely.It  takes time,but you will eventually get there. You will be under a lot of stress quite alright.If you are schooling and see that you can’t cope, it may be wise to relax or defer for a bit , if you can manage that .It just gives you time to process your loss I would advise you don’t process for too long, because if you do , your grades will go down,and that  will be another future headache. So while you are grieving get  hold of yourself and accept that you are not waiting for a phone call or some plea to get back together.Accept it is over and move on.</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="9">
          <b>Your Ex is your EX keep it that way</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>I will never advise that you never depend on your ex to help you do anything; you have to learn to live your life without them. Make effort to ensure they are not within your line of sight. It has to be a clean break or else you may not be able to recover from them. Even if you wish to remain as friends , wait for a while.</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="10">
          <b>Healing is the goal not REVENGE, learn from your mistakes</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Never retaliate against anyone who you feel has hurt you, it will only cause more damage. Retaliation can  lead to violence and there is the consequence of criminal charges if you are involved in damage of property. As much as you feel like hitting back,make  restraint your watch word</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="11">
          <b>Find Love Again</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>There is no formula on  the best time to date again. I would advise you don’t immediately jump back into dating.This does not mean wait for forever or never to love again. You will only end up bitter. Keep your dating casual for a bit to get to study and know your partner properly before you go in deep. There is a risk in opening yourself up again, but this is LIFE, you fall to rise again. I wish you all the best.</p>
