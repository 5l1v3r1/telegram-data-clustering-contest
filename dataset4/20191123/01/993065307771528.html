      <p>POLICE are to send a file on a prominent Roma leader in Northern Ireland to prosecutors over a malicious poster campaign.</p>
      <p>Nicolae Nicola (30) was interviewed under caution last week as part of an investigation into alleged exploitation and intimidation affecting the Roma community.</p>
      <p>It emerges after The Irish News revealed a man was convicted earlier this month for sending "menacing" online communications.</p>
      <p>Mr Nicola was the public face of the Romanian Roma Community Association of Northern Ireland (RRCANI).</p>
      <p>The south Belfast charity was accused last year of charging Roma "large sums of money" for what should be free benefits advice.</p>
      <p>Whistleblowers raised this claim with the Belfast Trust, which responded by moving its Early Years children's services out of RRCANI's Holylands offices.</p>
      <p>RRCANI strongly denied the allegations.</p>
      <p>Intimidating posters later appeared on walls which named and made false allegations about two Early Years staff who worked closely with the Roma community.</p>
      <p>Mr Nicola was arrested in February and a file was sent to PPS for alleged harassment and attempted intimidation.</p>
      <p>However, prosecutors decided not to pursue a case after concluding its evidential test had not been met.</p>
      <p>Last week Mr Nicola was questioned again voluntarily after new evidence emerged, BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan Show reported.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Detective Inspector Stephen Harvey said: "A 30-year-old male was interviewed under caution last week and a file is currently being prepared for resubmission to the Public Prosecution Service."</p>
      <p>Mr Harvey said the PSNI's "investigation into exploitation and criminality affecting the Roma community, led by Criminal Investigation Branch in Belfast, is continuing".</p>
      <p>He thanked those who have come forward so far and urged anyone with information to phone police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month Daniel Serban (41), of Tildarg Street in Belfast, was convicted in his absence of improper use of an electronic communications network.</p>
      <p>The charge is understood to relate to the sharing online of images of the intimidating posters put up in south Belfast last year.</p>
      <p>He was accused of sending in October last year "by means of a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that was of a menacing character".</p>
      <p>A second man – Florin Bondor (32), of Thorndale Avenue in the north of the city – has been brought to court charged with the same offence. He denies the charge.</p>
      <p>Their cases have been adjourned until January.</p>
      <p>Serban, a member of the north's Roma community, was pictured some years ago with Sinn Féin's Máirtín Ó Muilleoir while wearing the Lord Mayor of Belfast's chain of office.</p>
      <p>Mr Ó Muilleoir said he had his picture taken with thousands of people when he was Belfast mayor in 2013/14, and does not know Serban.</p>
      <p>Last year Mr Ó Muilleoir had posted on Twitter his support for RRCANI when allegations about the organisation began circulating online.</p>
      <p>He tweeted a photo of himself outside RRCANI's offices with people including Mr Nicola, and said he was "proud to stand with RRCANI".</p>
      <p>The South Belfast MLA had also written to Belfast Trust criticising the decision to move children's services from RRCANI.</p>
      <p>He later said that Sinn Féin is "opposed to all forms of racism, exploitation and intimidation" and called for a thorough police investigation.</p>
