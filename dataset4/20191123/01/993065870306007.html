      <p>Over the next few weeks Natasha Carruthers should have been preparing for Christmas, buying presents for her young daughter and looking forward to spending time with her family.</p>
      <p>Instead, her heartbroken relatives will be continuing to mourn the loss of a much-loved 23-year-old, who died following a high speed car chase along country roads in Co Fermanagh in October 2017.</p>
      <p>The young mum was thrown through the windscreen of her Vauxhall Corsa after it hit a tree at over 60mph on the outskirts of Derrylin.</p>
      <p>She was in the passenger seat, the driver was her boyfriend, Nathan Phair, who was trying to evade Cavan man Padraig Toher, whom he had earlier swindled in a drug deal.</p>
      <p>The two men had engaged in a 12-mile chase that at one stage reached 100mph and during which Toher rammed his BMW several times into the back of the Corsa.</p>
      <p>Judge Neil Rafferty told both men they had contributed to the untimely and tragic death of Natasha.</p>
      <p>''To drive at speeds and in the manner which you did on public roads displayed a deliberate, outrageous and wanton callous disregard for the safety of the public and those occupants of either car.''</p>
      <p>He sentenced Toher to 12 years, half in prison and half on licence. Phair was given 11 years, half in jail and half on licence.</p>
      <p>After the hearing, Detective Chief Inspector Eamonn Corrigan welcomed the sentences pointing out that Toher had accepted responsibility at an early stage while remorse had been lacking in the case of Phair.</p>
      <p>The officer said he hoped the sentencing would send out a clear message to anyone who drives recklessly or dangerously on our roads and also give some small measure of comfort to Natasha's family.</p>
      <p>These two men have now lost their liberty but a young woman has lost her life and a little girl will grow up without her mother.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Natasha's family said her daughter, Lily-Rose, had just turned one when her mum was killed.</p>
      <p>''She will never know her mum. All she will have is photos from when she was a baby. We will never be able to replace the love of her Mummy.''</p>
      <p>This is an absolutely tragic case which has had the most profound and devastating consequences.</p>
      <p>It should serve as a warning to anyone who drives in a way that puts lives at risk.</p>
