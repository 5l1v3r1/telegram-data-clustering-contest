      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/bella-thorne/">Bella Thorne</a>‘s most recent social media share is driving her Instagram followers crazy. As those who follow the stunner on Instagram know, Thorne regularly shares photos and videos of her famous friends on her page, and today was certainly no exception. In the stunning new snapshot, the actress can be seen posing with pal Cara Delevingne, and both ladies look absolutely flawless.</p>
      <p>In the caption of the shot, Thorne told fans that the first round was a knockout while noting that they’re missing Delevingne’s girlfriend, Ashley Benson. In the photo, she posed with a metal wall just at her back while she sits behind Delevingne. The actress looked directly into the camera, putting her legs around Delevingne and her hands on her shoulders. The social media sensation sizzled in leather knee-high boots and a black tank top. She wore her long, dyed locks down and slightly waved with a black Balmain beanie on top. Thorne also rocked a stunning application of makeup that included winged eyeliner, blush, highlighter, and lipstick.</p>
      <p>Just in front of her sat Delevingne, who wore her long locks slicked back in a high ponytail while also sporting a gorgeous application of makeup like her friend. The model’s abs were on full display in a pair of mesh leggings, as she completed the look with a pair of black boxing gloves that had gold Balmain logos on the front.</p>
