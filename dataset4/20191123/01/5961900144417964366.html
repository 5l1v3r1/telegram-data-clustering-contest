      <h1>Bali Lands On List Of Destinations To Avoid Thanks To Bogans And Plastic Pollution</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T01:55:01+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 01:55</time> by <a rel="author">By Alasdair Duncan</a></address>
      <p><b>Bali </b>has found itself on a list of destinations for responsible travelers to avoid, and you can bet your Bintang singlet that the hordes of <b>Aussie</b> bogans causing havoc on the island are party to blame.</p>
      <p>Every year, major travel guide <b>Fodor’s</b> publishes its <a href="https://www.fodors.com/news/photos/fodors-no-list-2020">‘No List’</a>, in order to highlight issues – whether ethical, environmental or political – that might make tourists reconsider their plans.</p>
      <p>In the case of Bali, Fodor’s says that the beloved holiday destination has “suffered the effects of overtourism” to the point where the local economy and environment are feeling the strain.</p>

      <p>According to their figures, Bali produces over 3,088 tonnes of waste per day, but less than two thirds makes it to landfill, which has led to a “garbage emergency” on beaches and in local waters.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the island is suffering from water scarcity, and the development of luxury accommodation and tourist destinations has eaten into the profits of local farmers.</p>
      <p>There’s also the matter of unruly tourists. An estimated 1.2 million Aussies travel to Bali each year, but the level of criminal behaviour and other types of mischief is so high that locals are fed up.</p>
      <p>On average, an Aussie tourist dies in Bali every nine days, and <b>DFAT</b> says the most common causes of hospitalisation for young Australians are <a href="https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/archive/news/how-one-aussie-tourist-dies-every-nine-days-on-paradise-island-of-bali/news-story/74839b828cb4e762519d9ca0daa12673">“motorbike accidents and nightclub fights.”</a></p>
      <p>In addition to this, it’s “common” for Australians to be reported missing on the island, and the Consulate “regularly” deals with tourists who have overstayed their Visas.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Balinese governor <b>I Wayan Koster </b><a href="https://7news.com.au/news/bali/bali-governor-warns-theyll-send-home-misbehaving-australian-tourists-c-458737">called for stricter laws</a> that would allow unruly and disrespectful tourists to be sent home from the island.</p>

      <p>One recent, notorious incident concerned an Aussie man who was involved in an alleged drunken fly-kicking incident in the street, sending a man flying off his scooter.</p>

      <p>Authorities in Bali have also complained about the level of disrespect that tourists show to temples and other sacred sites, with many climbing all over them to take pictures for Instagram.</p>
      <p>Fodor’s says that destinations on its ‘No List’ are not places that should be completely shunned, but rather, those that deserve tourists in “smaller and better doses”.</p>
      <p>What this all boils down to is that if you <i>are </i>planning a trip to Bali, it’s worth keeping in mind how you can do so while respecting the place and its people and not trampling all over the local environment.</p>
