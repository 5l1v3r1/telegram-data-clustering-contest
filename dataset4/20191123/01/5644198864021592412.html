      <p>GENEVA: Judges at the World Trade Organisation can earn more than 300,000 Swiss francs tax-free for what is a part-time job, the United States said on Friday (Nov 22), in a fresh onslaught on its beleaguered arbitration system.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration has been seeking to paralyze the WTO Appellate Body and experts say its likely demise next month is a further move away from multilateral rules designed to promote global free trade and toward a "law of the jungle".</p>

      <p>For two years the Trump administration has been blocking appointments to the top body that rules on trade disputes, which means it will soon have too few members - just one judge - to function at all. The terms of the other two remaining judges end on Dec 10.</p>
      <p>US ambassador Dennis Shea raised the fresh issue of compensation at the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) on Friday. He drew ire from some members, trade officials said after the closed-door talks.</p>
      <p>"Taken together, the amount of compensation and other payments realized per member has remained steady and at a high level – well in excess of (Swiss francs) 300,000 (US$301,175) for part-time employment," Shea said in a speech issued by the US mission.</p>
      <p>Judges rule on an average of five or six appeals per year, he said, questioning their entitlement to a year-round apartment in Geneva.</p>
      <p>"For purposes of comparison, we understand that this compensation is significantly more than the annual salary of a WTO Deputy Director-General," Shea said.</p>
      <p>About 70 per cent of initial WTO rulings are sent for review by a three-person panel of the Appellate Body, making it central to binding settlements of international disputes.</p>
      <p>Of the 13 disputes now on its docket, only two or three are advanced, having held hearings, trade officials said.</p>
      <p>Major trading partners took the floor to react to the US remarks, trade officials said, including the European Union which told the talks: "The discussion on remuneration is only relevant if there is a functioning Appellate Body."</p>
      <p>China said that if there were seven judges as designed, each would earn less, and noted that they don't receive pensions.</p>
