      <h1>Mumbai: Kishori Pednekar elected BMC mayor, says pothole-free roads priority</h1>
      <h2>Elected unopposed; party corporator Suhas Wadkar elected deputy mayor</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T01:13:18+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 01:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/shiv-sena/">Shiv Sena</a> corporators Kishori Pednekar and Suhas Wadkar were on Friday elected Mumbai mayor and deputy mayor, respectively. The Sena corporators were elected unopposed after the opposition in Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) refrained from fielding any candidates for the two top posts. Mahadeshwar’s tenure ended on November 21.</p>
      <p>The Sena, which rules the BMC, has a maximum of 94 corporators, followed by the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> with 84 corporators. With the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance in tatters and the power-sharing negotiations between the Sena, NCP and Congress to form the state government in Maharashtra, the Congress and NCP refrained from fielding candidates against the Sena for the mayoral office. Despite its strained relationship with the Sena, the BJP, too, decided to stay away from the mayoral contest.</p>
      <p>On Friday morning, when outgoing mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar declared Pednekar and Wadkar as mayor and deputy mayor, respectively, the Congress and NCP corporators were seen clapping. Outside the civic house, celebrations started soon after their names were formally announced. Later, Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, wife Rashmi, newly elected Worli MLA Aaditya Thackeray and other party leaders also reached the venue to wish the two.</p>
      <p>A three-time corporator, Pednekar was elected from Worli. Soon after her election, Pednekar told the media that her priority is to make Mumbai pothole- and plastic-free. “I will ensure that the city gets the best roads and make it plastic-free. I will also make sure that citizen facilities be improved and give my best to make the city better.” She was first elected to the civic body in 2002.</p>
      <p>One of the oldest Shiv Sainiks to help the party fortify its base in Worli area, Pednekar had earned praise for her work during Yuva Sena chief Aaditya’s election campaign from the Worli Assembly constituency. She will be the fifth mayor from the constituency.</p>
