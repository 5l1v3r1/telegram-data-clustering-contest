      <h1>Two-thirds of child abuse survivors thrive as adults</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T01:15:07+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 01:15</time> by <a rel="author">HealthDay News</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 22 -- Two in three survivors of childhood sexual abuse have good mental health, but a new study suggests that social isolation, chronic pain, substance abuse and depression can hinder recovery.</p>
      <p>Researchers looked at 651 Canadian survivors to identify factors associated with what the researchers call complete mental health.</p>
      <p>"Remarkably, two-thirds [65 percent] of the childhood sexual abuse survivors in our sample met the criteria for complete mental health -- defined as being happy or satisfied with life most days in the past month, having high levels of social and psychological well-being in the past month, and being free of mental illness, suicidal thoughts and substance dependence in the past year," said lead author Esme Fuller-Thomson. She is director of the Institute for Life Course and Aging at the University of Toronto.</p>
      <p>"While the prevalence of complete mental health among childhood sexual abuse survivors is higher than we had expected, it is still substantially less than that found in the general population [77 percent]," Fuller-Thomson said in a university news release.</p>
      <p>Survivors who'd been depressed at any point in their life were significantly less likely to have complete mental health, a finding that highlights the importance of mental health treatment for these patients, according to the authors.</p>
      <p>"Having a confidante was found to be the second-strongest single predictor of complete mental health, increasing the odds of past-year complete mental health nearly sevenfold," said co-author Deborah Goodman, director of the Child Welfare Institute, Children's Aid Society of Toronto. "Given the importance of family and social support systems, brief interventions to address trauma post-experience and bolster social and familial support are also called for," Goodman said.</p>
      <p>Also, childhood sexual abuse survivors who had chronic pain were half as likely to have complete mental health as those without chronic pain.</p>
      <p>"By expanding our research focus from the devastating consequences of childhood sexual abuse to factors correlated with well-being in adulthood, we may be able to help design more effective interventions for those affected to not only survive, but thrive," Fuller-Thomson said. The study was published Nov. 19 online in the journal Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology.</p>
