      <p>NEW DELHI: <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Bharat-Petroleum">Bharat Petroleum</a> chairman has hailed the government move to privatise the company as ‘tremendous value’ creator, pitting him against union of employees of his company and other state oil firms who are strongly opposing it.</p>
      <p>In a letter to <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/bharat-petroleum-corporation-ltd/stocks/companyid-11941.cms">BPCL</a> employees, Chairman D Rajkumar has tried to address their anxiety on privatisation and sought their support in ensuring that daily business goes ‘without any disruption’ during transition.</p>
      <p>“As the organisation experiences this transition, I urge all of you to be the ambassador of this change, in your own unique ways,” Rajkumar wrote. “Disinvestment of BPCL is expected to unlock tremendous value by way of enhanced professionalism, access to advanced <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/hcl-technologies-ltd/stocks/companyid-4291.cms">technologies</a>, newer <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/global-capital-markets-ltd/stocks/companyid-7976.cms">global market</a>, diversified product portfolio and improved availability of resources, further propelling our growth journey.”</p>
      <p>Employee unions have been outraged at the government’s decision to sell all its stake in BPCL. “The decision is ill thought, regressive &amp; anti-people and other avenues for raising finances without sale of stake or without transfer of management has not been examined,” the Federation of Oil PSU Officers (FOPO) and Confederation of Maharatna Companies (COMCO) said in a press statement after their executive committee meeting on Friday.</p>
      <p>“The decision will erode precious wealth, goodwill and working spirit built over the years and is therefore grossly against the interest of common public,” they said.</p>
