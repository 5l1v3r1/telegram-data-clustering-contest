      <p>The U.S. Coast Guard took nine Hudson River ferries operated by NY Waterway out of service Friday over safety concerns.</p>
      <p>Violations were spotted during a routine annual inspection, according to Coast Guard spokesman John Hightower.</p>
      <p>“The were some safety problems that warranted taking the vessels out of service until they’ve been rectified,” Hightower said.</p>
      <p>He declined to detail the safety issues.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for NY Waterway also refused to explain the violation.</p>
      <p>“These are minor infractions and most of them are fixed even as we speak so it’s just a matter of the Coast Guard reinspecting them so they can go back in service,” said NY Waterway spokesman Pat Smith.</p>
      <p>Smith said there would be no impact on service. He anticipated that the ferries will be back on the water sometime next week.</p>
      <p>He added that two of the boats were already offline receiving repairs. NY Waterway has a fleet of 37 commuter ferries that run year round from four piers in Manhattan across the Hudson River to eight locations in New Jersey including stops in Hoboken and Weehawken.</p>
      <p>NY Waterway also operates the Brookfield Place/Battery Park City Ferry Terminal.</p>
