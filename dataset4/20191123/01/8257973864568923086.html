      <h1>New England Patriots QB Tom Brady dealing with right elbow injury</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T01:49:20+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 01:49</time> by <a rel="author">Connor Grott</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 22 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/New_England_Patriots/?tps=1">New England Patriots</a> star quarterback <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Tom_Brady/?tps=1">Tom Brady</a> is questionable for Sunday's matchup against the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Dallas-Cowboys/?tps=1">Dallas Cowboys</a> because of an elbow injury.</p>
      <p>Brady was a surprising late addition to the Patriots' <a href="https://www.patriots.com/news/week-12-patriots-cowboys-injury-report?frifinal">official injury report</a>, appearing only on Friday as a limited participant. League sources told <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1197995791274651648">NFL Media</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/tom-brady-questionable-injury-report-will-be-good-go-sunday">NBC Sports</a> that Brady is expected to suit up against the Cowboys despite his injury designation.</p>
      <p>Brady, 42, hasn't missed a game due to injury since the 2008 season, the year he sustained a torn ACL in the Patriots' season opener. If Brady fails to take the field, rookie quarterback Jarrett Stidham would take over as the team's starter.</p>
      <p>Through 10 games this season, Brady has completed 63.7 percent of his passes for 2,752 yards, 14 touchdowns and five interceptions. He currently has a quarterback rating of 90.1, which marks his lowest QB rating since the 2013 season (87.3).</p>
      <p>Patriots wide receiver and special teams star Matthew Slater (hamstring) and defensive back <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jason-McCourty/?tps=1">Jason McCourty</a> (groin) were also late additions to the injury report. Both players were limited participants in Friday's practice and listed as questionable.</p>
      <p>New England offensive tackle Marcus Cannon (illness), safety Patrick Chung (heel/chest) and wide receivers <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Phillip-Dorsett/?tps=1">Phillip Dorsett</a> (concussion) and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Julian-Edelman/?tps=1">Julian Edelman</a> (shoulder) were also labeled as questionable for Sunday's game. Wideout <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Mohamed-Sanu/?tps=1">Mohamed Sanu</a> (ankle) went from a non-participant to limited in Friday's practice.</p>
      <p>The Patriots will host the Cowboys at 4:25 p.m. EST on Sunday at Gillette Stadium.</p>
