      <p>It’s all very well to describe some dishes as “barbecued” simply because there was<br/>fire involved in their preparation. But is that enough?</p>
      <p>Well, not to me it’s not. When we talk about barbecue flavours, we are really<br/>talking about flavours from America’s south – flavours that had their roots in<br/>hardship and slavery and other injustices.</p>
      <p>Flavours that emerged as part of the ingenuity required to make cheap cuts of<br/>meat as tasty as expensive cuts. And as things turned out, often tastier.</p>
      <p>Is anyone really going to suggest that a fine roast of prime beef in Manhattan is an<br/>altogether more delicious dish than, say, a humble brisket of beef cooked over<br/>post oak by Aaron Franklin in Austin, Texas?</p>
      <p>Because I have eaten and enjoyed both on any number of occasions and, if you are<br/>offering me a return visit, make it Austin every time.</p>
      <p>To exhibit the tastes of real, southern barbecue, however, meat does not have to<br/>spend half a lifetime in oak smoke, or similar. In fact, try this simple smoke-<br/>roasted chicken dish and you will get the picture, I promise.</p>
      <p>There are several flavours on display here which help define those elusive<br/>barbecue qualities: in a freshly made barbecue sauce, golden peaches in all their<br/>sun-kissed southern glory deliver one, and wood-aged Kentucky bourbon<br/>another, with the cunning spices used in a southern dry rub filling in the gaps.</p>
      <p>Start by firing up your grill – for me, it will be a charcoal grill for authenticity, but<br/>a gas grill will also do a fine job – and generously salting, with sea salt, the chicken<br/>pieces you intend to use: it can be a whole, large jointed chicken, although I<br/>usually prefer four marylands, say, and another four bone-in, skin-on thighs.</p>
      <p>Leave them out of the fridge to return to room temperature after salting.<br/>Now, move on to the peaches: for this dish, if necessary, plunge a couple of large,<br/>ripe, yellow peaches into boiling water for just 30 seconds to loosen the skins.<br/>Cool and peel them under cold, running water before halving, seeding and<br/>coarsely chopping them.</p>
      <p>Heat 2tbs of canola (or similar) oil in a pot and sauté a chopped, white onion until<br/>golden (5-6 min); add a couple of cloves of finely chopped garlic. Continue to cook<br/>for a minute, and then construct your barbecue sauce by adding the peaches, a cup<br/>of tomato ketchup, half a cup of raw sugar (Dulce from Costa Rica if you can find<br/>it), ½ cup of Kentucky bourbon (I use Woodfords), 1/3 cup of cider vinegar, 2tbs<br/>Dijon mustard and bring to a simmer. Continue to simmer, stirring often, until it<br/>begins to thicken (25 mins).</p>
      <p>Transfer the sauce to a bowl and stir in a couple of squirts of sriracha (or Frank’s<br/>hot sauce, if you prefer, for greater authenticity). Leave it to rest and to cool.<br/>Now, back to the chicken pieces: oil them lightly with EV olive oil and dust them<br/>generously with an all-purpose rub: mine, for example, imparts the flavours<br/>associated with Kansas City barbecue, which is no bad thing.</p>
      <p>Check your grill to ensure it’s around the 180-200C mark before putting your<br/>chicken pieces, skin side down, over the heat.</p>
      <p>After 10 minutes, turn them through 90 degrees and, after 5-10 more minutes,<br/>flip the chicken pieces and check the thickest parts of a couple of the thighs with a<br/>probe thermometer. You are looking for at least 75C for cooked. Also, during this<br/>last 10 minutes of the cook, brush the chicken pieces with the barbecue sauce, and<br/>turn them once or twice to glaze them.</p>
      <p>And that glorious aroma that goes straight up your nose when you lift that lid?<br/>Yep, that’s the unmistakable aroma of southern barbecue, pardner. And no, I’m<br/>not talking about Tasmania here…</p>
