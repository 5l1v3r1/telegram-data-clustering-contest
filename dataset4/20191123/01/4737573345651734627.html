      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump claims he’s the reason China hasn’t taken steps to crush pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>Trump says he asked his “friend” Chinese President Xi Jinping not to send in the military.</p>
      <p>Trump told “Fox &amp; Friends” in a telephone interview Friday that he told Xi that efforts to quash the protests would complicate negotiations for a U.S.-China trade deal.</p>
      <p>China has warned it will retaliate against the U.S. if Trump signs a bill supporting the Hong Kong protests.</p>
      <p>Trump didn’t say whether he’d veto the bill but said “we have to stand with Hong Kong, but I’m also standing with President Xi.”</p>
      <p>Trump says if it weren’t for him “thousands of people would have been killed in Hong Kong right now and you wouldn’t have any riots.”</p>
