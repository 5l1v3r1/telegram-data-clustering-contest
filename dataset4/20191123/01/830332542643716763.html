      <p>BROGUE, Pennsylvania (CNN) - A small plane crash in York County has Federal Aviation Administration investigators stumped after the pilot was nowhere to be found, WPMT reported.</p>
      <p>Officials say a 1940s single-engine plane crashed just outside of Baublitz Commercial Airport in Brogue on Tuesday, about 300 feet away from a farmhouse with people inside.</p>
      <p>Robert Good, who works on the farm, says the pilot knocked on the owner's door before asking for help to move the plane down the hill, along Warner Road.</p>
      <p>"The Amish helped pull the plane where it is right now," Good said.</p>
      <p>Good and others saw the man walk up the hill toward the airport to make a call for a cab, but that was it. They haven't seem him since.</p>
      <p>"He evidently was not hurt, I mean, obviously," added Good.</p>
      <p>Officials are calling the circumstance surrounding the crash "strange," and State Police haven't been able to confirm any records of 911 calls.</p>
      <p>While the pilot's identity has not yet been released, public records show the plane is owned by Douglas Jones, a lawyer from Bel Air, Maryland.</p>
      <p>FOX43 reached out to airport officials for comment, but have yet to hear back.</p>
      <p>For now, the FAA is continuing its investigation. It's unclear if the pilot will face any charges or fines once he is located.</p>
