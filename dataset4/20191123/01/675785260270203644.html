      <h2>Excelsior striker Ahmad Mendes Moreira was joined by team-mates and FC Volendam opponents in protest after he said he suffered sickening racist abuse last weekend</h2>

      <p>Players in Holland stood still for the first minute of a game between Excelsior and FC Volendam as they protested against the alleged racist abuse suffered by Ahmad Mendes Moreira last weekend.</p>
      <p>Excelsior Rotterdam striker Moreira said he was called a "negro and cotton-picker" by fans from the beginning of last Sunday's fixture between his side and FC Den Bosch.</p>
      <p>And the 24-year-old led a new kind of protest against racism in football in Excelsior's game on Friday night.</p>
      <p>The game was kicked off, but then players of both teams stood still for the opening minute of the second-tier clash.</p>
      <p>All matches across the Dutch leagues are expected to take part in the same protest over the weekend.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, FC Den Bosch players showed solidarity with Moreira by wearing shirts bearing the slogan 'Together against racism' ahead of their match against Almere City on Friday.</p>
      <p>At Friday's game in Rotterdam, fans also unveiled banners reading 'Show Racism the Red Card', while the same message was displayed by Excelsior above the entrance to one of their stadium's main stands.</p>
      <p>The slogan 'Racism? Then we don't play football' will be displayed on the scoreboards at every ground in Holland this weekend.</p>
      <p>The Dutch Football Association, the KNVB, has said the unplayed minute will be added on at the end of every fixture.</p>

      <p>Prosecutors in Holland opened an investigation after last Sunday's game between FC Den Bosch and Excelsior Rotterdam was held up for half an hour after Moreira was allegedly abused.</p>
      <p>Moreira, whose parents hail from the West African nations of Bissau-Guinea and Guinea, claimed he was shouted at by Den Bosch supporters sitting near the touchline - forcing an angry reaction from the player.</p>
      <p>He was escorted off the pitch by sympathetic teammates before a lengthy break, during which the match looked as though it could be abandoned.</p>
      <p>However the game soon resumed and Moreira quickly provided the best response, scoring and cupping his ears in celebration.</p>
      <p>Objects were hurled at the striker and his teammates as they celebrated.</p>
