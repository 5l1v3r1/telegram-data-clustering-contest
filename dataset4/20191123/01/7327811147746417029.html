      <p>Forecasters say storms could choke parts of the United States <a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2019/11/aaa-more-than-55-million-travelers-taking-to-the-roads-and-skies-this-thanksgiving/">as more than 55 million travelers</a> hit the roads and skies for the Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
      <p>A wintry storm that has already caused a 50 car pile-up in Denver is moving from the Rockies toward the Northeast, dumping heavy rain along the I-95 corridor Sunday, according to ABC News.</p>
      <p>This storm could affect New England to New York City and possibly spread all the way down to the Mid-Atlantic region and across the Ohio Valley.</p>
      <p>A potentially disruptive storm is forecasted in the central U.S. early in the week, during the peak of Thanksgiving holiday travel, <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/travel/storms-to-pester-disrupt-2019-thanksgiving-travel-across-us/629522">according to AccuWeather.</a></p>

      <p>Bad weather can greatly affect travel in the 1,200-mile stretch facing the storm's path Wednesday, when travel is already expected to take four times as long without bad weather, <a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2019/11/aaa-more-than-55-million-travelers-taking-to-the-roads-and-skies-this-thanksgiving/">according to AAA</a>.</p>
      <p>A worst case scenario could bring widespread and heavy snow to some of the Midwest.</p>
      <p>Busy travel hub Chicago has the potential to be in the middle of the worst or may completely avoid it. Either way, <a href="https://abc7.com/travel/thanksgiving-travel-rush-likely-to-shatter-records/5694761/">ripple-effect airline delays</a> may increase as storms strengthen.</p>

      <p>That same storm will then move toward parts of California and the Southwest, and then to the South Central states by the end of the week.</p>
