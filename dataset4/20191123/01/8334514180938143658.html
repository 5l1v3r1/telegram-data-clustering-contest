      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Samsung heavy industries Co Ltd 010140KS has agreed to pay more than $75 million in criminal penalties to resolve a U.S. investigation of a scheme to pay millions of dollars in bribes to officials in Brazil, the U.S. Justice Department said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Samsung Heavy has admitted to paying about $20 million to a Brazilian intermediary between 2007 and 2013 knowing that parts of it would be paid as bribes to officials in Brazilâ€™s state-run oil company Petrobras SA (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/PETR4.SA">PETR4.SA</a>) for a contract which facilitated the sale of a drill ship by Samsung Heavy, the Justice Department said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Samsung Heavy will pay at least half of the total fine to the U.S. government under a deferred prosecution agreement filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, it said.</p>
