        <figcaption>Tech mania happens early. Why?</figcaption>

      <p>The Particle Debris article of the week comes from Chris Matyszczyk at <i>ZDNet.</i></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-decade-in-which-apple-google-and-friends-drove-us-mad/">“2009-2019: How Apple, Google, and friends drove us mad</a>.”</p>
      <p>Author Matyszczyk launches the impressive missive with:</p>
      <blockquote>When a decade ends, it’s time to look in the mirror. Do we like what we see? How much should we blame technology?<br/><br/>… Has the world become more open and connected, as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised? Or have we all become bitterly divided, nauseatingly irritable vessels of barely diluted bile?</blockquote>
      <p>I my mind, tech life sanity depends on three things:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>What circles you reside in.</li>
        <li>How you approach personal computing decisions &amp; strategies.</li>
        <li>Having a certain modesty &amp; restraint.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Not everything touted by tech giants, with fanfare, needs to be embraced. Not every personal activity needs to be flouted in public. Not every app urged by a friend on Facebook needs to be engaged. Author Matyszczyk notes:</p>
      <blockquote>We got so excited about posting our every thought, mood and self-image to Facebook and Instagram that we didn’t bother to consider the consequences.<br/><br/>Equally, tech companies got so excited about releasing more and more gadgets, software and liberating libertarian ideas that they didn’t stop to consider what the dark-spirited might do with them.</blockquote>
      <p>This article goes on for a bit, but the more you read it, the more you realize how frenzied and complex our tech lives have become. At this time of year when we both focus on friends and family and count our blessings, author Matyszczyk provides plenty of food for thought.</p>
      <p>And perhaps inspiration for our life moving forward.</p>
