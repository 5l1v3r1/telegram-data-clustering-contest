      <h1>Michael Bloomberg to spend $33M in a single week on 2020 TV ads</h1>

      <p>Welcome to the party, pal.</p>
      <p>Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg plans to drop a staggering $33 million on national and local television ads ahead of his <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/07/michael-bloomberg-again-eyeing-2020-presidential-bid-sources/">expected presidential campaign</a>.</p>
      <p>The spots are scheduled to run in 99 cities across the country from Nov. 23 to Dec. 3, according to the media intelligence firm Advertising Analytics.</p>
      <p>“Only Tom Steyer has spent more on TV ads, he’s at $38 million, but has been running ads since July,” Advertising Analytics analyst Ben Taber told The Post, referring to the other billionaire in the race.</p>
      <p>“Warren and Sanders are the next two largest advertisers, and they are both under $8 million each. So in one week Bloomberg has just about leapfrogged the whole field,” Taber said, referring two of the frontrunners, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.</p>
      <p>“Mike is prepared to spend what it takes to defeat Donald Trump,” a spokesman for the billionaire media mogul told The Post. He declined to comment further.</p>
      <p>But several Democratic candidates quickly tweeted their displeasure about the massive spending.</p>
      <p>“I’m disgusted by the idea that Michael Bloomberg or any billionaire thinks they can circumvent the political process and spend tens of millions of dollars to buy elections,” <a href="https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1198003321602265089">Sanders said in a Tweet</a>.</p>
      <p>The bulk of the ad buy — more than $6 million — will air nationwide. The biggest markets by city are New York, with $2.3 million, Los Angels with $1.9 million and Houston with $1.2 million.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg will also put $1.16 million into advertising in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area — that include one-minute spots with the local station WFAA, according to Federal Communications Commission filings.</p>
      <p>“Bloomberg for President. Mentions running against Trump 3x within creative,” reads a handwritten note on the WFAA contract.</p>
      <p>He’ll also target Donald Trump’s turf with $308,000 in West Palm Beach and Ft. Pierce, Florida where the president’s Mar-a-Lago club is located.</p>
      <p>The ad buy skips early primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire, hewing to Bloomberg’s plan to focus on Super Tuesday states given that he’ll be a latecomer to the crowded Democratic primary field.</p>
      <p>The three-term former mayor has not officially launched his 2020 campaign, but <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/michael-bloomberg-files-fec-paperwork-in-step-towards-white-house-bid/">he has filed paperwork</a> with the Federal Election Commission for a presidential bid.</p>
      <p>He’s already committed to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/bloomberg-will-drop-20m-to-defeat-trump-in-battleground-states/">pouring $15 million to $20 million</a> on a voter registration drive in battleground states to help the Democrats beat President Trump in November.</p>
      <p>That’s in addition to the $100 million he’s pledged to spend on anti-Trump spots in the battleground states.</p>
