      <p>The Federal High Court, in Abuja, will on November 29, rule on the bail application filed by Faisal Maina, son of a former Chairman, Pension Reform Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina.</p>
      <p>Justice Okon Abang fixed the date for hearing after entertaining  arguments on the bail application on Friday.</p>
      <p>Faisal, represented by his lawyer, Francis Oronsaye, on Friday, is being prosecuted on three counts bordering on money laundering, to which the defendant had pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>The counsel prosecuting him on behalf of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Mohammed Abubakar, opposed the bail application on Friday.</p>
      <p>Justice Abang had remanded Faisal’s father, Maina, who is also being prosecuted before the same court,  in Kuje Correctional Service centre.</p>
      <p>The judge had, however,  ordered the EFCC to keep Faisal in police custody at Police Tactical Squad, Asokoro, for investigation on allegation of possession of firearms and resistance to arrest.</p>
