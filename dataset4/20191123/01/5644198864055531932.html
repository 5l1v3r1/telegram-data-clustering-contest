      <p>JOHANNESBURG: South Africa snatched the last African place for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games with a 6-5 penalty shootout victory over Ghana in Cairo Friday (Nov 22) after a breathtaking third place play-off.</p>
      <p>The South Africans will join Egypt and the Ivory Coast as the three African representatives among 16 nations in Japan next July and August.</p>

      <p>Ghana twice came from behind in regular time, with the second equaliser scored on 85 minutes by Samuel Obeng, forcing the match to a shootout.</p>
      <p>Both sides converted four of the five mandatory kicks and after Lyle Foster gave South Africa a 6-5 lead, Emmanuel Cudjoe had his penalty saved by Mondli Mpoto.</p>
      <p>South African players and coaches hugged each other at the Cairo International Stadium while many Ghanaians slumped to the ground and wept.</p>
      <p>Ghana also lost on penalties against the Ivory Coast in the semi-finals of the eight-nation qualifying tournament, foiling them in the first of two chances they had to reach Tokyo.</p>
      <p>South Africa led when Habib Mohammed conceded a 15th-minute own-goal and Ghana levelled five minutes into the second half through an unstoppable Evans Mensah shot.</p>
      <p>Kamohelo Mahlatsi put South Africa ahead a second time after 62 minutes with a close-range shot, but a dazzling Mensah dribble and a fumble by Mpoto allowed Obeng to equalise.</p>
      <p>With extra time not part of the play-off regulations, the shootout drama began and Ghana looked the likelier winners until their fourth kick, from Fobi Kingsley, was saved.</p>
      <p>Africa has claimed five Olympics football medals with Nigeria winning gold, silver and bronze, Cameroon gold and Ghana bronze.</p>
      <p>Qualifiers are restricted to under-23 footballers, but the 16 finalists can include three over-age players, opening the possibility of Egypt choosing Mohamed Salah.</p>
      <p>Unlike Europe, where Olympics football attracts little attention, some African eliminators draw 60,000-plus crowds.</p>
