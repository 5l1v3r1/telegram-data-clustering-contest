      <h1>Dead Battleships: How It Felt To Watch Imperial Japan Destroy Pearl Harbor</h1>
      <h2>A terrifying experience.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T01:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author">Warfare History Network</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point: </b>It's important to remember our history so we do not repeat our mistakes.</p>
      <p>One of the defining images of the 20th century is the horrifying moment when the battleship USS <i>Arizona</i> exploded in a cataclysmic fireball at 8:10 am on Sunday, December 7, 1941. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor catapulted the United States into the most destructive war in human history.</p>
      <p>Nearly every American who is old enough can remember where they were and what they were doing on December 7. But there were thousands of young men whose lives and destinies were forever changed in those hours as the Japanese planes tore into the heart of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.</p>
      <p>Today the number of men, survivors who served on the ships moored along Ford Island’s famous Battleship Row is dwindling. Old men now, they are white haired with slow movements and shuffling feet, but their minds, filled with visions of an apocalypse they never imagined, are as sharp as ever.</p>

        <b>Target: Pearl Harbor</b>
      </p>
      <p>On that peaceful Sunday morning nearly the entire fleet was in port. The battleship<i> California</i> was moored far ahead of the paired <i>Maryland</i> and <i>Oklahoma</i>, <i>Tennessee</i> and <i>West Virgini</i>a, <i>Arizona</i> and the repair ship <i>Vestal</i>, and the lone <i>Nevada</i>. <i>Pennsylvania</i> was in drydock at the Navy Yard near the destroyers <i>Cassin</i> and <i>Downes</i> and the minelayer <i>Oglala</i>. More destroyers and submarines were tied to piers past the Navy Yard.</p>
      <p>The target ship <i>Utah</i> and cruisers <i>Helena</i>, <i>Honolulu</i>, <i>Detroit</i>, and <i>Raleigh</i> were on the west side of Ford Island. All in all, more than 90 vessels were in Pearl Harbor that morning.</p>
      <p>At 7:55 am the roar of aircraft engines shattered the early morning air. The first attack by 183 bombers and fighters was carefully planned to close in from all directions in a deadly inescapable web of destruction.</p>
      <p>The Japanese aircraft carrier <i>Akagi</i>’s 1st VT Squadron’s 12 Nakajima B5N “Kate” torpedo bombers, led by Lt. Cmdr. Shigeharu Murata, swept in a turn from the southeast to line up on the oblivious ships of Battleship Row. Behind them were 12 more from the carrier <i>Kaga</i>. Sixteen Kates from the carriers <i>Hiryu</i> and <i>Soryu</i> came in from the southwest toward the west side of Ford Island. Each carried a 1,870-pound Type 91 torpedo, specially modified to run in the shallow waters of the harbor. They were also fitted with two warheads to defeat the battleships’ armor belt.</p>
      <p>Far overhead, 30 Kate level bombers from the <i>Akagi</i> and <i>Kaga</i> put their crosshairs on the scrubbed teak decks of America’s vaunted battle fleet. Under the fuselages of the Kates were 1,700-pound Type 99 armor-piercing bombs modified from 16-inch naval shells.</p>
      <p>Lieutenant Commander Kakuichi Takahashi’s 27 Aichi D3A1 “Val” dive bombers from the carrier <i>Shokaku</i> attacked the Ford Island Naval Air Station and Hickam Army Air Field with 550-pound Type 98 general-purpose bombs. Another 27 dive bombers from the carrier <i>Zuikaku</i> went after Wheeler Airfield and Schofield Barracks. Forty-four Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters provided an air umbrella for the attacking bombers.</p>

        <b>“Air Raid Pearl Harbor. This is Not a Drill!”</b>
      </p>
      <p>None of the American sailors, Marines, soldiers, or airmen knew they were about to go to war. The Vestal was tied up on <i>Arizona</i>’s port side. “We were there to do some work on her,” said Radioman John Murphy of Oxnard, California. “I was coming off my watch, but wanted something to do. The officer of the deck suggested I go ‘next door’ to the <i>Arizona</i> and make a mail run. I had to wait for the OOD (officer of the day) to sign the weather report before I could go over. The sky was clear and quiet. Nothing was happening.”</p>
      <p>The <i>Nevada</i> was tied up aft of the <i>Arizona</i>. Her band was just finishing Morning Colors when the Kates bore in and released their torpedoes.</p>
      <p><i>Oklahoma</i> was outboard of <i>Maryland</i>. “I was going to go ashore on liberty and was in the shower,” said Yeoman First Class Ray Richmond. “Suddenly it felt as if someone had picked up the ship, shook it, and dropped it. I hit the overhead.”</p>
      <p>Thinking of the Army’s habit of dropping sandbags on ships for practice, he thought. “Oh, those Army planes are dropping really big sandbags on us.”</p>
      <p>“But then,” he continued, “the ship shuddered again, and I heard the general alarm and bolted for the door. I was naked as a jaybird, but I went to my battle station on Number 5 Port 5-inch, 51-caliber gun.” Richmond felt the huge battleship start to heel over to port from three torpedo hits. “Then the lights went out.”</p>
      <p>John Murphy was waiting for the OOD on Vestal. “We saw these planes coming in low,” he recalled. “One man said, ‘Why is the Army practicing on Sunday morning? Then the bombs began falling. I ran to the radio room and got to work. One of the first messages I picked up was ‘Air Raid Pearl Harbor. This is not a drill!’ No kidding, I thought.”</p>
      <p><i>Vestal</i> took two hits. “One bomb hit the crew’s mess and the other scored a hit where we stored the steel plate,” remembered Murphy. “If that steel hadn’t been there, the armor-piercing bomb would have gone right through the bottom of the ship.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Wee Vee</b>
      </p>
      <p>At berth F-6 astern of <i>Oklahoma</i> at the very center of Battleship Row was USS <i>West Virginia</i>. Known with affection to her crew as the “Wee Vee,” her distinctive cage masts and those of the USS <i>Tennessee</i> stood out clearly against the early morning sky.</p>
      <p>In <i>West Virginia</i>’s Quartermaster berth was Seaman First Class Stuart Hedley of West Palm Beach, Florida. He related, “I was in my dress blues and looking forward to going ashore to a picnic. Then the P.A. called out, ‘Away all fire and rescue crews!’ Then the bugler, that would have been Marine Corporal Richard Fisk, blew the General Alarm. I ran up five decks to my quarters to grab my hat, and a bos’n’s mate kicked me in the seat of the pants and yelled, ‘Get to your battle stations on the double! This is the real thing!’”</p>
      <p>Upon reaching the main deck Hedley saw planes coming in from all directions. “I saw a torpedo plane going over us, and the pilot was laughing like anything.”</p>
      <p>The 33,500-ton battleship was hit by seven torpedoes in all, causing the ship to heave as Hedley climbed up the ladder into the bottom of Number 3 turret, just aft of the superstructure. On top of the turret was a catapult and two Vought OS2U Kingfisher floatplanes. “I climbed into the turret,” recalled Hedley. “I was at the pointer station of the port 16-inch gun while my friend Crosslin was at the gun trainer’s seat. There was a bulkhead between us and the starboard gun compartment. A small hatch down near the deck was dogged down tight.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>“If I’d Had a Potato I Could Have Hit Him”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aboard the <i>Tennessee</i>, 17-year-old Seaman Second Class Jack Evans of Corcoran, California, was on duty. “On Friday we had been told we would be getting an inspection by Rear Admiral Isaac Kidd (commander of Battleship Division 1) on Monday. So we polished all the brightwork and locked the ammunition for the deck guns away in the magazines. I had just finished my cleaning station and was in the uniform of the day, white shorts, black socks and shoes, white pullover and cap. I was standing in our living space in the forward battle dressing station when General Quarters sounded. One of my mates said, ‘This is a helluva note for the ship to hold a drill in port on Sunday morning.’ Then a bos’n’s mate said, ‘This is no drill!’ When I reached the main deck, I saw Ford Island totally wrecked. Zeros were strafing the planes and a hangar had its door hanging off. I could see we were in trouble.”</p>
      <p><i>Nevada</i>’s crew scattered to its battle stations when the bombs and torpedoes came in. Down in her crew’s quarters was Woodrow “Woody” Derby of South Dakota. “I was in my bunk, reading. A few minutes before 0800 the alarm sounded. I went to my battle station in the magazines for the broadside guns. We were all down there and on alert. I couldn’t see a damn thing.”</p>
      <p>Two of the battleship’s boilers were still on line. Just after 8:05, a Kate dropped a torpedo that struck her port side, causing some flooding. “I felt the ship shuddering from the guns up on deck,” said Derby. “There was one big lurch, and we looked around, but none of us knew we’d been hit by a torpedo.”</p>
      <p>Jack Evans climbed the ladder on the outside of <i>Tennessee</i>’s foremast. “There were about eight of us in the foretop,” he said. “The foretop was like a metal bucket with a roof and a waist-high metal shield. We were about 122 feet off the water and could see everything. My job was to report aircraft to the fire control center phone talker. I saw plenty. I looked north toward the center of the island and watched the smoke rising from Wheeler Field and Schofield Barracks. To the east past the <i>West Virginia</i> and <i>Oklahoma</i> a really big column of smoke was rising over Hickam. I saw this one plane with fixed landing gear fly right over our bow. The man in the rear seat looked at me. If I’d had a potato I could have hit him.”</p>
