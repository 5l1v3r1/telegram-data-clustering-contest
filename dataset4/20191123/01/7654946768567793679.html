      <h1>Michael Blake’s apparent fraud is new test for New York’s ethics watchdogs</h1>

      <p>It looks like <a href="https://www.crainsnewyork.com/politics/bronx-pol-got-taxpayer-reimbursements-political-trips">Crain’s New York might’ve just caught</a> Assemblyman Michael Blake robbing the taxpayers. Now let’s see what the state’s various ethics watchdogs (watch-Chihuahuas?) do about it.</p>
      <p>State legislators are entitled to per-diem payments to cover expenses in Albany, as well as travel reimbursements. But — spoiler alert! — they can only collect for days they’re actually in Albany.</p>
      <p>Blake’s team insists that, for every full per-diem filing, he conducted official business in some way, shape or form, or at least went to sleep in Albany before midnight.</p>
      <p>But Crain’s has evidence suggesting that Blake charged for days when he was elsewhere: On April 25, 2017, for example, he missed all Assembly votes, including on five committees he serves on — and video apparently shows him at the Ohio Black Legislative Caucus’ Day of Action in Cleveland. Yet he claimed a full $175 “overnight” per diem, Crain’s reports.</p>
      <p>This year, on June 10, he expensed $640 in plane, train and taxi costs to attend a “legislative meeting” in Washington. Yet his own Instagram account appears to show him speaking at the national Democrats’ African American Gala in Atlanta, Georgia, that day.</p>
      <p>The state Comptroller’s Office, the Assembly Ethics Committee and the Joint Committee on Public Ethics all have jurisdiction to investigate. Since Blake is running for a US House seat, could one of them resolve this case before next June’s Democratic primary?</p>
