      <p>THE consultant at the centre of Northern Ireland's biggest patient recall has offered his "sincere sympathy" to those affected.</p>
      <p>Dr Michael Watt, a consultant neurologist who was based at the Royal Victoria Hospital for 20 years, remains suspended after almost 3000 of his former patients were re-assessed last year due to "safety concerns" about his works.</p>
      <p>It has emerged that more than 600 of this group may have been given an unreliable or "unsecure" diagnosis while there is "uncertainty" in relation to a further 300 cases.</p>
      <p>The figures were leaked to The Irish News last week and are contained in an "outcomes report" that was due to be published by the Department of Health in June.</p>
      <p>This was cancelled however due to "unforeseen circumstances".</p>
      <p>Patients with epilepsy, stroke and Parkinson's Disease were among those treated by the Belfast doctor.</p>
      <p>In a statement released to the BBC on the back of its Spotlight programme which reported that Dr Watt carried out hundreds of unnecessary procedures, the consultant said: "Patient care has always been of the utmost importance to me and the key focus throughout my career.</p>
      <p>"I have always sought to act in the best interests of my patients.</p>
      <p>"Current investigations have highlighted concerns over the security of a number of my patients' diagnoses. I recognise the considerable distress these events have caused and I can only express my sincere sympathy to any of my patients affected as a result."</p>
