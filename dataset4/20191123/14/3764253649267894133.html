        <b>Fans of controversial BBNaija star, Tacha, have been thrown into excitement following Ciroc's confirmation of their partnership with the <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/rivers-state-news-today.htm">Rivers</a> born reality star.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Earlier on, the reality star and entrepreneur had taken to her Instagram page to announce in a rather interesting way, that she had signed a partnership deal with the French brand.</p>
      <p>While her fans rejoiced over the new endorsement deal, a confirmation from the horse's mouth has left them more than ecstatic and may have given them reasons to shade other housemates.</p>
      <p>A fan of Tacha, had inquired to know when the variety of the liquor named after Tacha would be available for purchase. Replying to the question, the official account of the liquor brand confirmed Tacha's partnership deal.</p>

      </p>
      <p>This comes shortly after BBNaija winner, Mercy Eke, also <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1278169-mercy-eke-signs-partnership-ciroc-shortly-tacha.html">signed a partnership deal with the same liquor brand</a>. Just like Tacha, she took to her Instagram page to share an interesting video to announce the good news. In the video, she talks about once being a small girl with big dreams and later achieving her goals.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Mercy and Tacha have been in the news of late and not for the right reasons. The two ladies who fought back in the BBNaija house appear to have resumed their beef for each other and are busy throwing shades on social media.</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng</b> earlier shared how Tacha warned against 'getting too close to the heater, as plastic melts'. Her post was taken by many to be a message for Mercy who is alleged to have gone under the knife to enhance her behind. Mercy also appeared to have taken shots of her own when she said something about dancing on Instagram, a one-time proud past time of Tacha. <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277193-bbnaijas-tacha-throws-heavy-shade-social-media.html">However, the war seems far from over as Tacha recently threw another heavy shade on her Instagram page.</a></p>
