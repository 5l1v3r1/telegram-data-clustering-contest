      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:50:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/author/david-price/" target="_blank">David Price</a></address>
      <p>Apple has announced that it will offer free coding lessons in stores from 1-15 December 2019, to tie in with Computer Science Education Week and the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112722&amp;xcust=41-3778462-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fapple%2Fcoding-lessons-3778462%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhourofcode.com%2Fuk">Hour of Code</a> initiative.</p>
      <p>Many of the sessions are tailored specifically for schoolchildren, but adults, whether experienced or new to coding, have opportunities to learn too. The tutorials cover general coding advice, robotics and augmented reality (AR).</p>
      <p>The sessions offered, and the times and dates when you can take part, vary according to the store you visit. The <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/today/collection/codewithapple/coventgarden/">Covent Garden branch</a>, for example, has a half-hour Coding Lab for Kids session on 7 December, starting at midday, an AR workshop at 5pm on 4 December, Swift Playgrounds sessions throughout the fortnight and much more.</p>
      <p>For details of sessions at your local Apple Store, visit the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/today/collection/codewithapple/">Today At Apple</a> site. Click Details by any sessions that interest you, then 'Sign me up' to register.</p>
      <p>If you're interested in learning to code, it's worth taking a look at our <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac/complete-guide-coding-programming-apps-mac-3645777/">complete guide to coding on Mac</a>. This has general advice for budding programmers, and links to learning guides specific to the key languages, such as Swift, Java and Python.</p>
      <p>On a related topic, Apple has also announced an update and expansion of its Everyone Can Code curriculum, with additional teacher resources and a new guide called <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112722&amp;xcust=41-3778462-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fapple%2Fcoding-lessons-3778462%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbooks.apple.com%2Fbook%2Fid1481279769%2F">Everyone Can Code Puzzles</a>.</p>
