      <p>"It was her and a couple of neighbours trying to help.”</p>
      <p>Police desperately tried to save his life at the scene, but were unable to revive him.</p>
      <p>No arrests have been made and police are investigating.</p>
      <p>His Audi was towed away at around 7.30pm after forensic experts had combed the murder scene for evidence.</p>
      <p>The family member added: “We just don't get why it happened. His mum is in bits about it. She brought him into this world and she tried to save him. She was there when he went out of the world too."</p>
      <p>Since his death, conflicting media reports have circulated about Mr Williamson’s business activities, with national media reporting the assassination is connected to drug feuds.</p>

      <p>Talks of a gangland battle have prompted the family to speak out ‘to clarify some of what they have heard’.</p>
      <p>The family spokesperson added: ”He had a number of businesses with his wife. He paid his taxes, everything was above board. His mum wants people to know that.</p>
      <p>"I just wanted to set a few records straight. His mum just wants people to know that that he had nothing to do with drugs, he was not doing anything like that."</p>
      <p>Mr Williamson, nicknamed Snaggle, was well-known in the UK despite living in Spain for several years.</p>
