      <p><b>SOUTH SOLON, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Authorities say the death of a man found at the bottom of a drained sewage tank in Ohio appears to be accidental.</p>
      <p>The Columbus Dispatch reports the body of 34-year-old James Powers was found Wednesday in the recently drained tank at a wastewater treatment plant in the Madison County village of South Solon.</p>
      <p>Madison County Sheriff's Lt. Bryan White says deputies earlier this month investigated a vandalism report at the plant. He says grates had been moved and pumps appeared to have been tampered with.</p>
      <p>A tennis shoe was found near a missing grate. Deputies and plant employees had no reason to believe someone had fallen into the 15-foot-deep (4.6-meter-deep) tank, which was full at the time.</p>
      <p>White says Powers was well known in the area and was sometimes homeless.</p>
