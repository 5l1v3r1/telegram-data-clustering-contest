      <p>Jose Mourinho is back and his Tottenham reign began with a 3-2 win at West Ham on Saturday lunchtime.</p>
      <p>It was Mourinho’s first outing as a manager since a 3-1 defeat to Liverpool which brought an end to his Manchester United tenure.</p>
      <p>Here, the PA news agency takes a closer look at the Portuguese’s return.</p>
      <h3>Candid comments on key man dominate build-up</h3>

      <p>Straight from kick-off Mourinho was a man back in his natural habitat, prowling technical area in his navy mac. He was encouraging of his side, clapping periods of good play and celebrated Son Heung-min’s opener with passion, turning around to his bench and punching the air. That was nothing in comparison to what he had in store after Lucas Moura’s second, unleashing the famous kneeslide. He also showed his softer side, joining in for part of the minute’s applause for West Ham fan Lily Harris, who recently died. He remained calm when Spurs put themselves under pressure in the final 15 minutes with some sloppy play and even played peacemaker after a spat between Harry Kane and Robert Snodgrass. This was a man, for the moment, free of any pressure.</p>
      <h4>Moura the same with tactics</h4>
