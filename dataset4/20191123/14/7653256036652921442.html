      <p>In a stunning political development, Maharashtra Governor B.S. Koshyari early on Saturday administered the oath of office to Bharatiya Janata Party leader <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Devendra-Fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis</a> as the new Chief Minister of the state and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Nationalist-Congress-Party">Nationalist Congress Party</a> leader Ajit Pawar as the new Deputy Chief Minister.</p>
      <p>After all the twists and turns that took place in Maharashtra, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Mahindra-Group">Mahindra Group</a> Chairman <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Anand-Mahindra">Anand Mahindra</a> took a dig on the situation by retweeting a video with a quote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Mahindra said that the video aptly described the current situation in Maharashtra politics. In the video, boys are seen playing kabaddi with one raider, who is from the other side, is dragged back almost when he is about to touch the centre line.</p>
      <p>On November 15, Anand Mahindra had tweeted the video of a kabaddi match.</p>
      <p>At that time, Mahindra's tweet said, "Received this video with the following message: 'Even in an adverse situation, one shouldn't give up till the last moment as it is possible to transform failure into success.' Couldn't agree more! And haven't seen this stunt too often, even in #PKL!"</p>

      <p>After what happened in Maharashtra, Mahindra quoted his older tweet and said, "Remember this video I had tweeted? Can you think of any more appropriate way to describe what just happened in Maharashtra?"</p>
      <p>Mahindra's tweet has garnered a staggering response with 2.3K likes and 12.7K retweets within eight hours.</p>
      <p>One user wrote, "The overconfident raider is none other than <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/sanjay-raut">sanjay raut</a>."</p>
      <p>"#UdhavThackeray so near yet so far," wrote one user.</p>
      <p>Another remarked, "Uddhav Thackeray has been run out -- based on script written by Amit Shah &amp; Sharad Pawar."</p>
