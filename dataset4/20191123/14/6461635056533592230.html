      <h3>Former Juventus midfielder, Claudio Marchisio, gets candid about his admiration for Barcelona Legend Andres Iniesta and names the Spanish maestro as the best player to ever play the sport.</h3>
      <p>Andres Iniesta was a Barcelona player for 22 years before joining J-League side Vissel Kobe in the summer of 2018. He was one of the marquee players in the Guardiola Era that saw the club legend not only win the Treble domestically but also win the UEFA Euro in 2008 and FIFA World Cup in 2010 with his national team.</p>
      <p>Claudio Marchisio, who recently retired from the sport, could not contain his admiration for the Spanish legend. The ex Italian international claimed that Iniesta should have easily won at least one Ballon d’Or.</p>
      <blockquote>“He has never won the Ballon d’Or. I don’t really understand why,” Marchisio stated, during the <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/marchisio-the-best-player-in-the-history-of-football-is-andres-iniesta-7747170"><b>Premios Liedholm gala</b></a>, delivered in Cuccaro Monferrato, in Italian Piedmont.</blockquote>
      <p>He continued to praise the former Barca captain’s ability to play on both feet flawlessly,</p>
      <blockquote>“Iniesta has three brains, one in his right foot, one in his left foot and one in his head, It’s amazing how easy he can teach and play football. He was Barcelona’s lethal weapon,” Marchisio added.</blockquote>
      <p>Though Barcelona’s success throughout the years has been largely credited to Lionel Messi, Marchisio believes that the real hidden gem for Barca was the Spanish maestro.</p>
      <blockquote>“Yes, they have Messi, but for me Iniesta has been one of the best players in history,”</blockquote>
      <p>The former Juve and Barca midfielders have faced each other on numerous occasions for club and country. The Italian stated that he has a great relationship with the Spanish international.</p>
      <p>Marchisio has been hailed as a Juventus Legend after appearing for 389 games for the Serie A side. <a href="https://everythingbarca.com/2019/10/23/barcelona-finally-identify-andres-iniestas-ideal-successor/"><b>Iniesta</b></a> has appeared for 674 matches for the Catalonian side. Both the players have given it all for their respective clubs and deserve the highest honor as footballers.</p>
      <p>Do you agree with Claudio Marchisio?</p>
