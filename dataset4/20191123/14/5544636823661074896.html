      <p>A court in the United States has issued a warrant of arrest against the Chairman of Air Peace Airlines, Allen Onyema.</p>
      <p>A copy of the warrant published by <i>Premium Times</i> showed that the warrant was issued on November 20.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/23/allen-onyema-full-text-of-us-20m-fraud-allegations-against-air-peace-owner/">US Justice Department had on Friday accused Onyema of “moving more than $20 million</a> from Nigeria through United States bank accounts in a scheme involving false documents based on the purchase of airplanes.”</p>
      <p>Also, according to a statement from the US Justice Department, Onyema’s Chief of Administration and Finance, Ejiroghene Eghagha, has been charged with bank fraud and committing aggravated identity theft in connection with the scheme.</p>
      <p>But in a brief statement on Saturday, Onyema denied all the allegations, saying that all the money transfer for the purchase of aircraft passed through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).</p>
      <p>The US authorities said they had also seized funds in, at least, three bank accounts they said were traced to the two Air Peace chiefs.</p>
