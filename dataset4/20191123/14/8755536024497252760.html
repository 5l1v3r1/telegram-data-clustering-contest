      <p>Roz Purcell has admitted she got used to telling the same fib during interviews, amid her eating disorder struggle.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the former model admitted she spent years battling an eating disorder during her early 20s.</p>
      <p>Back in 2013, Roz launched her food blog Natural Born Feeder, and around the time she did a lot of press surrounding her own diet and work out regime.</p>
      <p>At that time, the Tipperary native was battling serious body issues, but was “pretending everything was fine.”</p>

      <p>Looking back at that time, Roz told the Irish Daily Mail: “I was doing all these interviews on ‘how to get Roz’s body’ or ‘how to eat like Roz.’ Everyone wanted to be like that, but I didn’t even feel like that.”</p>
      <p>“I felt in a way that my biggest fear was that people wouldn’t like me any more [if I put on weight] and that people preferred this version of me.”</p>
      <p>Roz continued: “I do love training, but it was at a level that wasn’t good for me. I was about to have a breakdown. My body was falling apart.”</p>
      <p>“But I was very good when I did interviews: I had it down to a tee. I just got used to telling the same fib over and over again.”</p>

      <p>When asked if she regrets building a career on her professed healthy lifestyle, despite the fact that she was really struggling on the inside, Roz said: “I guess back then there wasn’t social media like it is now, and I wasn’t using it every single day.”</p>
      <p>“How I got the books and stuff was more about, ‘I’m good at creating recipes’. I did create indulgent recipes as well. If you look at loads of chefs, do they eat everything they cook?”</p>
      <p>“I’d never say I got my career based on how I look. I’m good at creating recipes and I’m glad I started a food blog (NATURALBORNFEEDER.com). But I wasn’t letting myself enjoy it,” she admitted.</p>

      <p>“I was feeding into my own insecurities. I could think to myself, ‘I wish I didn’t do it like that,’ but I was young, impressionable and vulnerable.”</p>
      <p>Thankfully, Roz has a much healthier relationship with food now, thanks to Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.</p>
      <p>During her interview, the brunette also opened up about meeting her boyfriend Zach Desmond back in 2016, who she now lives with.</p>

      <p>At the time, Roz was on the road to recovery, and said, “It helped meeting someone. I don’t know, it was just a new person to be around, and he really did help.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t think I spoke about it for the first couple of months, but then I told him that I was coming out the other end of this. I was nice to be with someone who liked me for who I am.”</p>
      <p>“Although anyone out there recovering from an eating disorder knows that you don’t need to get a new boyfriend to be better,” she added.</p>
