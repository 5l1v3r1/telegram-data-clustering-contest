      <p>
        <b>Roberto</b>
      </p>
      <p>Two incredibly nervy clearances in the opening five minutes set the tone, the got nowhere near a free kick that was headed in by Sanchez but ruled out for offside. Punched Ogbonna instead of the ball. Should have stopped Son's goal as well. Kane's header went through him for the third. Awful. <b>2</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>Ryan Fredericks</b>
      </p>
      <p>Booked in the first half as Son had the beating of it for most of the opening 45 and the right back struggled. Improved after the break but not a good day for the right back. <b>4</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>Issa Diop</b>
      </p>
      <p>Very harshly booked in the first half and is now suspended for the trip to Chelsea next weekend. Completely lost his bearings that allowed Son all the time in the world to pick his spot. Easily beaten by Kane for Spurs' third. Poor. <b>3</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>Angelo Ogbonna</b>
      </p>
      <p>Very solid opening 45 minutes on his comeback as he dealt with Harry Kane well. Struggled in the second 45, looked knackered having not played for the best part of a month but still showed he's a better option than Balbuena at the current time. Scored late on to give the scoreline a gloss the hosts didn't deserve. <b>5</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>Aaron Cresswell</b>
      </p>
      <p>A very "meh" performance where he didn't get forward enough or defend very well. Just average. Was alright in the second half but there wasn't much to say. <b>4</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>Declan Rice</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Saw an awful lot of the ball in the first half and made a number of interceptions as well. Played at centre back for the final 25 minutes. One of the better players for the hosts. <b>6</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>Mark Noble</b>
      </p>
      <p>Put in far more effort than most in the first half as he ran around and battled but no-one seemed bothered to join him in that. You suspect he will be absolutely ripping his teammates to shreds in the dressing room post-match. At least he looks like he cares. <b>5</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>Robert Snodgrass</b>
      </p>
      <p>Had a shot on goal that drifted well wide in what was his best moment of the first half where the Scotsman was largely anonymous. apart from when he had some handbags with Kane. <b>3</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>Andriy Yarmolenko</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

      <p>
        <b>Felipe Anderson</b>
      </p>
      <p>Awful in the opening 45 minutes as he barely did anything. Misplaced a pass to Haller which should have been better. Hauled off at the break as his season goes from bad to worse. <b>2</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>Sebastien Haller</b>
      </p>
      <p>Couldn't get enough on an early header to trouble Gazzaniga too much. Could have done better with a chance despite Anderson's pass not being the best. Too weak as Spurs countered and Son scored. Nothing in the second half. <b>3</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>Substitutions</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Michail Antonio (for Anderson, 46')</b>
      </p>
      <p>Provided energy and got a goal on 75 minutes with a crisply hit shot that was far too good for Gazzaniga. A welcome return to action for a player who has been badly missed. <b>6</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>Pablo Fornals (for Yarmolenko, 55')</b>
      </p>
      <p>Touched the ball maybe once, perhaps twice. <b>3</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>Carlos Sanchez (for Diop, 65')</b>
      </p>
      <p>At least brought some stability into the midfield. <b>5</b></p>
