      <p>Ghanaian Gospel singer Brother Sammy aka the Nation’s worshipper has reacted to some allegations on social media that he has been sleeping with video vixen cum actress Rosemond Brown aka Akuapem Poloo.</p>
      <p>It would be remembered that actress Xandy Kamel some weeks ago dropped a bombshell that the gospel singer was secretly sleeping with Akuapem Poloo and that he has been ‘chopping’ her ‘basabasa’.</p>
      <p>According to Brother Sammy in his reaction, all the allegations leveled against him about having an intimate relationship with Akuapem Poloo are false. Adding that he has never cheated on his wife since they got married.</p>
      <p>He continued by saying that Akuapim Poloo doesn’t know his house as been claimed and he only met her on a movie set.</p>
      <p>Brother Sammy revealed that he always gets saddened when he is accused of such an immoral act because he had never cheated on his wife since he got married.</p>
