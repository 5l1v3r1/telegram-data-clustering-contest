      <p>Tehran: Iranians struggled to adjust to life offline for almost a week and were forced to resort to old ways due to a near-total internet blackout imposed amid violent protests.</p>
      <p>The demonstrations flared on November 15, hours after a shock decision announced at midnight to raise the price of petrol by up to 200 percent in the sanctions-hit country.</p>
      <p>The timing of the announcement was seen as a bid to forestall chaos, such as caused by motorists stocking up on fuel before the hike took effect.</p>
      <p>The internet restrictions, for their part, apparently aimed to temper shows of dissent and anger over the move and stop footage of the unrest from being shared.</p>
      <p>Brigadier General Salar Abnoosh, a deputy head of the Basij volunteer militia, said Friday that the internet outage had helped to "disrupt the complicated" plans by Iran's enemies.</p>
      <p>On Saturday -- day seven of the internet restrictions and the start of the working week in Iran -- people in Tehran were trying to overcome problems brought on by the outage.</p>
      <p>Some said they had been forced to make long journeys to carry out simple transactions that they used to be able to do in a couple of clicks online.</p>
      <p>"We have no other choice," said a woman in her 30s who only gave her name as Asgari.</p>
      <p>"What I could have done by using internet now I have to do by telephone or some other means," she told AFP.</p>
      <p>"I've taken today off from work to come into town to do something which I could've done by using the internet."</p>
      <p>Others said they were having difficulty reaching loved ones overseas.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to call my children but I couldn't," said Taheri, a man in his 70s. "They were worried and had to go and get a card to call us. This is not right."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Â Economic impact</b>
      </p>
      <p>For many in Iran, the lack of internet access was more than just a hindrance to social activity.</p>
      <p>The country has a thriving online economy, with its own equivalents for apps like Airbnb, Amazon and Uber.</p>
      <p>They have come through the outage largely unscathed as people can still access domestic applications on their phones.</p>
      <p>However, smaller businesses that rely heavily on social media to stay in touch with their clients suffered during the outage.</p>
      <p>Among them were travel agencies whose services were badly disrupted.</p>
      <p>"An acute problem has been created for all travel agencies," said Hormatollah Rafiei, head of the Travel Agents Guild Association.</p>
      <p>"The sale of foreign tickets and reservations for foreign hotels reached zero and some travel agencies closed due to financial losses," he said, quoted by ILNA news agency.</p>
      <p>Connectivity in Iran "began to fluctuate on Friday evening (November 15) before a sequence of cuts that saw levels fall to a nadir of four percent" compared with normal levels, said Netblocks, a site that monitors global internet disruptions.</p>
      <p>"Apart from fluctuations on Sunday, access to the outside world flatlined consistently until Thursday when limited connectivity appeared across most regions," it said.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, connectivity was back up, the monitor added.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'What can we do?'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Iran's arch-enemy the United States slapped sanctions on its telecommunications minister overnight "for restricting internet access".</p>
      <p>The minister, Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi, said he was just another Iranian made to suffer the consequences of sanctions that the US reimposed after withdrawing from a 2015 nuclear deal.</p>
      <p>"I'm not the only member of club of sanctioned persons," he tweeted.</p>
      <p>"Before me, Iran ICT startups, Developers, Cancer patients and EB children were there," he said, referring to epidermolysis bullosa (EB).</p>
      <p>Iran says the US sanctions have hindered its access to drugs for EB, a skin condition that afflicts children, causing several deaths.</p>
      <p>The government said it would unblock the internet only when it was sure it would not be abused.</p>
      <p>Mina, a woman in her 50s, said she had little choice but to sit tight.</p>
      <p>"My family lives abroad and I was always in touch with them but now I have no contact with them," she told AFP.</p>
      <p>"I need to get a phone card because it's too expensive to call abroad (from a fixed line phone)," she added.</p>
      <p>"What can we do? We are trying to stay patient."</p>
