      <h1>We visited Kohl's and saw why sales are dipping as the company looks like it might suffer the same fate as other department stores, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:08:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:08</time> by <a rel="author">Shoshy Ciment, Business Insider US</a></address>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/kohls">Kohl’s</a> just reported third quarter <a href="https://corporate.kohls.com/news/archive-/2019/november/kohl-s-corporation-reports-financial-results">earnings</a> and sales that missed analysts’ estimates.</li>
        <li>The company said on Tuesday that sales at stores open at least a year grew 0.4% in the most recent quarter.</li>
        <li>We visited a Kohl’s in August and saw why the retailer <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kohls-is-defying-the-retail-meltdown-2018-1">poised to take on</a> the retail apocalypse might not survive after all.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>It looks like Kohl’s isn’t defying the retail apocalypse after all.</p>
      <p>The company reported weak earnings for its third quarter and <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/kohls-stock-price-earnings-q3-slowing-growth-profit-guidance-cut-2019-11-1028700307">lowered it’s outlook</a> for the remainder of 2019. Stocks <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/kohls-stock-price-earnings-q3-slowing-growth-profit-guidance-cut-2019-11-1028700307">dropped</a> as much as 13% in early trading on Tuesday, following the announcement.</p>
      <p>For a bit, it seemed as though Kohl’s was a bright spot in the department store sector. Kohl’s stores are not entirely mall-based, a factor which <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kohls-is-defying-the-retail-meltdown-2018-1">previously helped</a> the company avoid the grim fate of stores like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jcpenney-dramatic-decline-history-photos-2019-5">JCPenney</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sears-to-close-96-more-stores-kmart-list-sears-transformco-2019-11">Sears</a>. Kohl’s announced a partnership with Amazon in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kohls-returns-amazon-how-to-2017-9">2017</a> to accept returns for the e-commerce giant in its stores, a move which <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-returns-help-boost-kohls-stores-shopper-traffic-2019-8">boosted traffic nearly 24%</a> in the three weeks after the partnership began, data from inMarket revealed.</p>
      <p>But now, the numbers – and stores – reveal that Kohl’s is only further proving that the death knell for the department store has long past rung.</p>
      <p>We visited a Kohl’s in August and were surprised to find it messily filled with out of style merchandise and clothes. After seeing the problems in person, we understood why the retailer might not be able to defy the retail apocalypse after all.</p>
      <p>Here’s what we saw:</p>
