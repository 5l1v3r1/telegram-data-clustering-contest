        <b>The violent protests that engulfed the Latin American country earlier this month have led to the resignation of President Evo Morales and a shift in power, with numerous countries refusing to recognise the interim government.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Washington is involved in the violent clashes that led to the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911211077364786-morales-says-wants-to-return-to-bolivia-needs-security-guarantees-from-interim-govt/">change of government in Bolivia</a> in November, Director of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Sergey Naryshkin stated on Saturday. According to the official, the US needed a crisis in Bolivia to change the nation's policy, adding that the situation will remain rocky for awhile.</p>
      <p>He also noted that the crisis was akin to the unrest in Venezuela, stating they belong to the same strategy.</p>
      <p>The statement comes amid growing tensions in La Paz, as interim Interior Minister Arturo Murillo announced that a <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911231077381993-bolivias-interim-government-opens-criminal-case-against-morales/">criminal investigation would be opened against ousted President Evo Morales</a> due to the latter's alleged instigation of the protests.</p>

      <p>Morales fled Bolivia earlier in November after the military and police refused to support him amid mass rallies against the results of a presidential vote, in which he secured a fourth term in office.</p>
      <p>His supporters, however, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911211077363580-evo-morales-seeks-international-assistance-for-bolivia-return/">refused to recognise Jeanine Anez,</a> who was proclaimed interim president following his ouster, so the country is still being rocked by violent protests, resulting in a growing death toll.</p>
