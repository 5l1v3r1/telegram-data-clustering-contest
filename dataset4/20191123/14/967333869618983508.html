      <blockquote>"Some countries in the region should know that they will not have an easy life in the region if clues are found that show they intervened to create unrest in Iran", Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri stated on Saturday.</blockquote>
      <p>In the meantime, Iranian officials have told Fars news agency they managed to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911201077354265-iran-successfully-tackles-security-issues-will-repel-enemy-in-economic-war---khamenei/">stifle violent unrest in Kermanshah Province</a> this week, also accusing US agents of supporting the armed protesters.</p>
      <blockquote>"All the forces of the Revolutionary Guards, the (paramilitary) Basij, the Intelligence Ministry, police, and the army took part actively in controlling the situation", Parviz Tavassolizadeh, the head of the judiciary in Kermanshah said, adding that the armed rioters had also burned public property.</blockquote>

      <p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has stated, commenting on the unrest, that the protests across the country have been fuelled by foreign influence. The protests in some cities have turned violent, with people setting fire to cars and fighting with local police.</p>
      <p>The Islamic Republic has been suffering under harsh economic sanctions that were <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911181077337608-several-law-enforcement-officers-killed-during-riots-in-iran/">re-imposed by the United States</a> last year after President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement.</p>
      <p>One year later, Tehran retaliated by suspending part of its obligations under the deal and promised that it would gradually abandon other limitations under the accord if other signatories can't find a way to circumvent the sanctions and resume trade with the country.</p>
