      <h1>AK-47 on Steroids? Russia Is Ready To Sell Its AK-308 Assault Rifle</h1>

      <p><b>Key point:</b> Russia is eager for arms sales.</p>
      <p>Russian weapons manufacturer Kalashnikov Concern has unveiled their new<a href="https://tass.ru/armiya-i-opk/5473204"> AK-308 assault rifle</a> at the “Army 2018” expo in Moscow.</p>
      <p>At first glance, the AK-308 appears to be a rebrand of Kalashnikov’s AK-12 with some design elements from the AK-103. But its tame appearance belies what makes the AK-308 one of Kalashnikov’s most ambitious products in decades: it houses 7.62x51mm NATO rounds.</p>
      <p>Since the Second World War, Kalashnikov has produced over twenty assault rifles. Of these, all but three have employed Soviet/Russian-made ammunition. The AK-101 and AK-102 with 5.56x45mm NATO rounds were Kalashnikov’s first foray into exporting a rifle with NATO-standard ammunition, but these made a small international splash.</p>
      <p>The AK-108, also made for 5.56x45mm rounds, likewise generated little interest from major foreign buyers. The 108 was part of the late AK-100 series line (107-109) that was<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/explained-strange-story-ak-12-rifle-35157"> plagued by</a> recoil inconsistencies, heaviness and needlessly complicated design.</p>
      <p>Two decades later, Kalashnikov is trying again. The AK-308 uses a different NATO rounds— 7.62х51 as opposed to 5.56x45mm—that trades more weight and recoil for better range and penetration capability. The AK-308 is marginally longer and heavier than the AK-12 to accommodate its heavier caliber type. It incorporates many of the AK-12’s improvements,<a href="http://modernfirearms.net/en/assault-rifles/russia-assault-rifles/ak-12-ak-15-eng/"> including</a> a collapsible buttstock and redesigned gas tube. The AK-308 uses a firearm frame based off the RPK-74M, a design choice meant to increase durability.</p>
      <p>Barring the kinds of<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/explained-strange-story-ak-12-rifle-35157"> quality control issues</a> that plagued early AK-12 test units, the AK-308 should offer better handling and performance. But performance improvements are to be expected, given the two decades separating the AK-308 from the AK 100-series. The question is whether it can improve in a cost-effective way, especially since Kalashnikov is pitching the AK-308 as an affordable alternative to<a href="https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2018/11/6/fn-america-announces-scar-20s-precision-rifle/"> western</a> 7.62x51mm rifles.</p>
      <p>Recycling parts of the AK-12’s<a href="https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2018/02/13/engineering-new-kalashnikov-ak12-ak15/"> efficient</a> design is sure to reduce Kalashnikov’s overhead, but it remains to be seen if they can integrate 7.62x51mm rounds while keeping production costs sufficiently low.</p>
      <p>There is no indication that the Russian government itself is planning to use the AK-308, either among its military or domestic police. As with the AK-101 and 102 before it, the AK-308 is a near-identical variant of Kalashnikov’s current flagships produced purely for export purposes.</p>
      <p>Kalashnikov’s recent push into the export market is distinguished not just by new technology, but by a different business model. Whereas the AK-101 was not produced for anyone in particular, the AK-308 is designed and marketed with a specific buyer in mind: India.</p>
      <p>India is a recurring importer of Russian defense technology stemming back to the Cold War period. The Kremlin has been aggressively pursuing the Indian export market, recently signing a<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russias-sale-s-400-india-part-bigger-defense-partnership-35732"> $5.43 billion deal</a> with New Delhi that included the sale of five Russian S-400 surface-to-air-weapons systems and four Russian <i>Admiral Grigorovich</i>-class frigates.</p>
      <p>But Russia has struggled to sell small arms to India over the years. Kalashnikov was passed up in a recent Indian assault rifle procurement<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/search-for-rifles-russia-not-in-list-of-5-selected-nations/articleshow/64406348.cms"> search</a> because, as it happens, the Indian military is<a href="https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2016/10/12/india-restarts-rifle-program-solicits-7-62x51mm-rifles-not-5-56x45mm/"> looking</a> specifically for 7.62x51mm rifles. The AK-308, then, is an explicit Russian attempt to become India’s primary rifle exporter after a two-decade hiatus of indigenously produced Indian INSAS rifles.</p>
      <p>Besides giving Russia a foothold in the lucrative Indian market, a cost-effective 7.62x51mm rifle could tempt other buyers looking for cheap, reliable, NATO-standard caliber arms. Brazil has been mentioned as a prospective client, and even Pakistan has<a href="https://topwar.ru/150078-novyj-avtomat-ak-308-pod-patron-762h51-nato.html"> apparently expressed interest.</a></p>
