      <h1>Leganes 1-2 Barcelona: Vidal scores winner as Blaugrana scrape win</h1>
      <h2>Barcelona got the three points but did not play well against La Liga's bottom side</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:22:07+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:22</time> by <a rel="author">Ivan San Antonio</a></address>
      <p>Barcelona came from behind to beat Leganes 2-1 on Saturday to cover up what was another disappointing performance away from Camp Nou in La Liga.</p>
      <p>Arturo Vidal struck the winner in the 79th minute after Luis Suarez had earlier cancelled out Youssef En-Nesyri's opener at Butarque.</p>
      <p>Barca were on track for a fourth league defeat in seven away games in the league this season before Suarez drew them level.</p>
      <p>The Uruguayan rose highest to connect with Lionel Messi's free-kick and head past the impressive Ivan Cuellar.</p>
      <p>Vidal then sealed the three points 10 minutes from time when he prodded home from close range after Leganes failed to clear a corner.</p>
      <p>The goal was checked by the VAR for offside but was awarded as the final touch before Vidal scored came off a Leganes player.</p>
      <p>En-Nesyri had earlier given the home side a deserved early lead as they continue to show signs of improvement under new coach Javier Aguirre.</p>
      <p>The Moroccan was given too much time to cut in on to his left foot and rifle an unstoppable effort past Marc-Andre ter Stegen.</p>
      <p>Leganes had chances to double their lead before the break but twice found the side netting as Barca struggled to wake from their slumber.</p>
      <p>The Catalans did finally get going -- kind of -- in the second half. Suarez had already levelled when Valverde rang the changes, removing Antoine Griezmann and Sergio Busquets for Ivan Rakitic and Vidal.</p>
      <p>Frankie de Jong was latter replaced by Ansu Fati before Vidal won the three points late on.</p>
      <p>Barca move on to 28 points and remain top of the league. Real Madrid can join them later on Saturday if they beat Real Sociedad at the Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
