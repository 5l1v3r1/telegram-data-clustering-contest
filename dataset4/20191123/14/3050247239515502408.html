      <h1>Bitcoin Price May Hit $5.5K in 2020 to ‘Wear Out Bulls’ — Peter Brandt</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:59:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:59</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) could spend months trading at $5,500 before it recovers, one of the best-known analysts in the industry has warned. </p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1198040324830093312">tweet</a> on Nov. 21, Peter Brandt revealed his target for Bitcoin price was a floor of $5,500. Negative pressure had engulfed markets on the day, sending BTC/USD to lows of $6,850.</p>
      <h3>Brandt: length of bear market “might be surprise”</h3>
      <p>What happens next, he argued, could continue that trend — and make it last longer than the general consensus suggests.</p>
      <p>“My target of $5,500 is not far below today's low. But I think the surprise might be in the duration and nature of market,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>Brandt continued: </p>
      <blockquote>“I am thinking about a low in July 2020. That will wear out bulls quicker than a price correction.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Price halvings before block reward halvings</h3>
      <p>Should such a status quo endure, it would run in stark contrast to the current prevailing mood among Bitcoin observers. As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-bitcoin-stock-to-flow-chart-shows-bearish-periods-precede-halvings">reported</a>, the popular Stock-to-Flow model for Bitcoin price predicts an average of $8,300 for BTC/USD until next May.</p>
      <p>At that point, the block reward halving event should trigger a bull market. Last week, fellow trader Tone Vays <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-hit-4-500-but-miners-have-mostly-capitulated-analysts">suggested</a> its impact should be in evidence even several months in advance.</p>
      <p>Vays nonetheless admitted that Bitcoin could drop even lower than Brandt anticipates — to around $4,500, which statistician Willy Woo said is entirely possible. </p>
      <p>Since the start of the week, Bitcoin has dipped more than 15%. According to Woo, that style of behavior will characterize markets going forward.</p>
      <p>“I expect way more volatility. Short term bearish is all I'm saying. And don't expect price will repeat past halvenings,” he <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/willy-woo-8k-bearish-bitcoin-price-in-unique-setup-before-halving">said</a>.</p>
      <p>In July, when BTC/USD fell below $9,500 after its run to highs of $13,800, Brandt warned the cryptocurrency should see losses of up to 80% of that peak. This would put it at <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-below-95k-could-spark-80-parabolic-advance-correction">just $2,760</a>.</p>
