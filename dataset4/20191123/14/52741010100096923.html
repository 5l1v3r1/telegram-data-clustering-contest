      <h2>Descendants Brewery is hosting the vegan-themed holiday event</h2>

      <p>Waterloo Region is in for a vegan holiday treat this Sunday.</p>
      <p>Descendants Brewery is hosting the Vegan Christmas Market on November 24, the first ever of its kind in the region.</p>
      <p>You can expect local vegan business selling all sorts of apparel and accessories; baked and savoury goods; and cheese (made from milk alternatives). There will also be local craft beer and music to enjoy.</p>
      <p>Darren Power, Operations Manager, FAIR/SQUARE Canada—ironically located in the dairy capital of Canada, Woodstock—helped organized the event with his wife.</p>
      <p>He says the "vegetarian and veganism movement has been growing quite a bit in the last few years" and the two of them realize an opportunity as there hasn't "been a vegan Christmas market organized, outside of Toronto."</p>
      <p>"We know there's an amazing vegan community in this area, so we called up Descendants and they were happy to have us."</p>
      <p>Power says not only can you expect "different stuff that you wouldn't see at another event," but much of what's being sold would be Canadian and/or fairtrade.</p>
      <p>"So, that's a big part of the movement, is like treating people as good as we want to treat animals as well."</p>
      <p>The event is all-ages, as well as nut-free. They will also be selling raffle tickets for prizes. Tickets are $5 and all proceeds are donated to the Froghollow Farm Sanctuary.<br/> </p>
