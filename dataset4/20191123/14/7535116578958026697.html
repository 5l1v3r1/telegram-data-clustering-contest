        <i>Hereâ€™s your feel-good story of the day:</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Larkin Fire and Rescue Department in Johor had received a report from the public at 9:19 am yesterday (22 November) on <b>a stray cat that had fallen into a drain</b>.</p>
      <p>The department chief, Nazarudin Yusof led a team of <b>seven personnel with a fire engine equipped with ropes and ladder</b> to the scene. The drain was 6 metres deep and filled with stagnant water, the cat couldâ€™ve easily drowned if nobody had done anything to rescue him.</p>

        <i>Judging by the footage provided, that was indeed a huge drain. No wonder seven firemen were required to get the job done!</i>
      </p>
      <p>The firemen worked together to rescue the cat by sending one man down the drain with a harness on. According to <a href="https://www.sinchew.com.my/content/content_2151116.html">Sin Chew Daily</a>, the stray cat that was stranded on the sewage pipe seemed to be afraid of the fireman who approached it. In the process of avoiding the fireman, the cat fell into the drain!<i> Oh no!</i></p>

      <p>Kudos to the Johor Fire and Rescue Department for taking an extra mile to rescue the cat! To add to this piece of good news, <b>the kind firemen took the stray cat back to their headquarters to bathe and feed him</b>. <i>Aww! </i>Weâ€™re also really glad that the public and bomba took this catâ€™s life seriously and not let him drown in filth.</p>
