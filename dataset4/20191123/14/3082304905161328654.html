      <p>Harry Maguire is delighted to see his boyhood club Sheffield United flying high in the Premier League and wants them to win every game – unless they are playing Manchester United.</p>
      <p>England centre-back Maguire became the world’s most expensive defender when he moved to Old Trafford in a reported £80million deal from Leicester City in the previous transfer window.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old came through the Blades’ academy and made over 100 senior appearances for the club before leaving to join Hull City in 2014.</p>
      <p>Maguire gets the chance to play at Bramall Lane again on Sunday, as the Red Devils – who sit a point behind the Blades – face Chris Wilder’s side.</p>
      <p>“It means so much, the club that gave me the chance of fulfilling my dream of becoming a professional footballer,” Maguire told BBC Sport when asked about his return.</p>
      <p>“I owe them a lot, I go back and support them whenever I can.</p>

      <p>“It’s the first result I look for when I get off the pitch. I want to see them win every game they play, apart from when we’re playing against them. A fantastic club and it’s great to see them back in the Premier League where they belong</p>
      <p>Maguire acknowledged he is unlikely to get much in the way of support from friends as he visits his old club – but insists his loved ones will be cheering him on.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully I’ll be the one smiling with my friends and not them,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure some of [my friends] will be supporting Sheffield United, but my family will be supporting Man United and hoping we get the three points.”</p>
