      <p>Today's featured event:</p>
      <p>Hear folk singer-songwriter Ellis Paul at 8 tonight at the Blue Door, 2805 N McKinley.</p>
      <p>A regular at Okemah's Woody Guthrie Folk Festival, Paul will bring with him new songs from “Storyteller’s Suitcase,” the album he released in May on his own Rosella Records label. Recorded in Woodstock, New York, the album’s title track is stuffed with recollections and lessons from his life as a traveling troubadour.</p>

      <p>“It’s my 20th project, so I’m pretty deep in the well now. I was writing down days of my life, like what was the most beautiful thing you’ve ever seen, what was the most profound thing that you ever did, what did you witness, what were you part of. … I just used images from my own experiences. I’ve been mentoring people, because I’m getting up there now, and people are coming to me,” he told me <a href="https://oklahoman.com/article/5635500/interview-photos-and-video-ellis-paul-making-another-musical-pilgrimage-to-oklahoma-for-the-2019-woody-guthrie-folk-festival">in an interview earlier this year.</a></p>
      <p>“I thought that song would serve that purpose in a way, of talking about all the great stuff you get to go through by living your life on the road. … There’s no school in how to be a folk singer. It’s not something you go to college for or anything like that. So, having mentors, I think, really is important. I certainly did. Bill Morrissey was my biggest mentor coming up.</p>
      <p>"And obviously Woody is a mentor, but he’s not alive. So, I have to use what I think he would tell me, and that whole ‘What would Woody say?’ … is always sort of in the back of my mind.”</p>
