      <h2>Fan favourite BT Gunn will be back on the billing at the Ballerup Hall</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser N Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-n-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>The stars of British Championship Wrestling are set to return to East Kilbride next month.</p>
      <p>And Ballerup Hall will help the promotion start the Christmas season off with a bang, welcoming a host of fans' favourites to the show.</p>
      <p>Organisers say they are “buzzing” to get back to East Kilbride, adding that the promotion has “really missed the fans and the buzz of Ballerup Hall”.</p>
      <p>With wrestling getting bigger and bigger and wrestlers in such high demand, organisers say they are “extremely happy” to be able to bring firm <br/>fan favourites to East Kilbride.</p>
      <p>That includes BCW heavyweight superstars BT Gunn, Jack Jester, Stevie Xavier, Kenny Williams and much more!</p>

      <p>BCW mastermind Graham McKay told us: “I’m really looking forward to getting back to East Kilbride.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been involved in the wrestling business for 17 years and can safely say there is no family show in the UK that has the same buzz that EK fans bring with them.</p>

      <p>“And there is no other venue that allows you to get so up close to the action. This was the very first venue we ran as a promotion and we are proud of what it has become today.</p>
      <p>“There are simply no fans like it.”</p>
      <p>Tickets for BCW Live cost £12.50, with a group ticket for four coming in at £40.</p>
