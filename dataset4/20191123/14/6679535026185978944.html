      <h2>Historian also urges them to learn foreign languages as it would be an added benefit</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:01:04+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Special-CorrespondentVijayapura-119694/" target="_blank">Special CorrespondentVijayapura</a></address>
      <p>Asserting that the role of a tourist guide is significant in disseminating information about historical monuments, Abdul Ghani Imaratwale, historian and professor, said that guides should not misguide visitors with unsubstantiated information of history.</p>
      <p>He was addressing guides at a workshop, organised by ASI, Dharwad circle, as part of World Heritage Week at Gol Gumbaz on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“I am not saying that guides should have a perfect knowledge of history. Even basic information is enough, as tourists also want limited information. However, the guide should present the right facts and details,” Prof. Imaratwale said.</p>
      <p>Describing Vijayapura as the land of sufis and saints, he advised the guides to ensure that such information is passed to visitors.</p>
      <p>He also stated that learning foreign languages would give an added advantage to the guides.</p>
      <p>In his address, Anil Kumar, Superintending Archaeologist, also advised guides to be factually correct when giving information.</p>
      <p>“Just tell history as it is, do not add your views or opinions. You can take little leniency in telling some myths to make information interesting, but also make it a point to tell the visitors that it is only a myth as there is no historical confirmation of it,” he said.</p>
