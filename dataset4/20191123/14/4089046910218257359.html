      <p>According to <a href="https://www.wkbw.com/news/local-news/lancaster-school-board-terminates-contract-with-doctor-who-denied-girl-right-to-wrestle">WKBW</a>, the school board voted unanimously on Saturday morning to end a contract with that doctor.</p>
      <p>The report says 12-year-old Trista Blasz has won national competitions, and she passed two physical tests mandated by the state of New York.</p>
      <p>On Trista's physical maturity form, signed by Dr. Michael Terranova, the box "not cleared" is checked. Next to it a handwritten note says, "Girls don't play boys sports in Lancaster schools."</p>
      <p>WKBW reported that Terranova was an independent contractor and not an employee of the school district.</p>
      <p>The school board approved a partnership with a new medical director, who will look at Blasz's request to join the JV wrestling team.</p>
      <p>"I wrestled from 14 to - I want to say 19 when I left college after I wrestled there for three and a half years,” said Cristta Hartinger, Trista’s aunt.</p>
      <p>Hartinger said Terranova almost stripped her of her chance to wrestle more than a decade ago.</p>
      <p>"He said we've decided that you can't wrestle because you're a girl,” Hartinger said.</p>
      <p>Twelve years later, Hartinger’s niece finds herself in the exact same situation: Denied a chance to wrestle on the Lancaster boys team because the same doctor said no.</p>
      <p>"It's the same doctor, Dr. Terranova, and he did give me the same excuse, which was girls don't wrestle on boys teams,” Hartinger said. "It was a back-in-the day situation, and I never thought that this day would really truly come to be honest."</p>
      <p>Jill Fecher, a school board member, said, "There is absolutely no policy about girls playing boy sports," but added the state requires the decision to be made by a three-person committee. The district can’t overturn it.</p>
      <p>"They just make up excuses for it because sometimes, they don't want girls to outshine the boys,” Trista said.</p>
      <p>"I mean, I was on the team, so I think Trista - there should be no question that she should be able to be on it or not,” Hartinger said.</p>
      <p>In a statement Lancaster Schools Superintendent Dr. Michael Vallely says he disagrees with the review committee's decision to ban Trista from the team.</p>
      <p>WKBW reached out to Terranova, but hasn’t heard from him.</p>
