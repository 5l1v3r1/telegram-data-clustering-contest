      <h1>Liverpool line up confirmed with Mohamed Salah out and Andy Robertson in for Crystal Palace</h1>
      <h2>Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson were both injury doubts ahead of Liverpool's clash with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:10:10+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/paul-gorst/" target="_blank">Paul Gorst</a></address>
      <p>Mohamed Salah is named on the substitutes' bench as Andy Robertson starts for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> at Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>Both players had been doubtful this week due to injuries, but nine-goal top scorer Salah is named on the bench as influential left-back Robertson takes his place in the back four.</p>
      <p>Salah has been hampered by an ankle problem since the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/klopp-guardiola-liverpool-leicester-goals-17038279">2-1 win over Leicester on October 5</a> and missed international duty with Egypt as a result.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andy-robertson-scotland-liverpool-injury-17279722">Robertson also withdrew from the Scotland squad</a> for their games as he nursed his own ankle issue over the break.</p>
      <p>It means Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain takes his place in the front three alongside Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino.</p>
      <p>Virgil van Dijk starts at centre-back alongside Dejan Lovren with Fabinho, Jordan Henderson and Gini Wijnaldum making up the midfield three.</p>
      <p>Van Dijk pulled out of the Netherlands squad for Tuesday's game with Estonia for what was deemed as "personal circumstances" but is fine to play a part in south London.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp's has won all four of his games as Liverpool manager at Selhurst Park and has a chance to extend the Reds' lead at the top of the Premier League to 11 points ahead of Manchester City's visit from Chelsea in Saturday's evening kick-off.</p>
      <p><b>Liverpool:</b> Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Lovren, Robertson, Fabinho, Henderson, Wijnaldum, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Firmino, Mane.</p>
      <p><b>Subs: </b>Adrian, Milner, Keita, Salah, Gomez, Lallana, Origi.</p>
