      <p>“It’s fantastic to be back in the Champions Cup at the AJ Bell and after the disappointment of losing the arm wrestle at Glasgow, the lads will be looking to bounce back,” director of rugby Steve Diamond said.</p>
      <p>“La Rochelle are a hugely physical team and we had a great match with them last year in the Challenge Cup quarter-final, so we know what they are about.</p>
      <p>“We just have to make sure we get our basics right and perform this weekend.”</p>

      <p>Gloucester face an uphill task to progress after losing their Pool Five opener against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulouse">Toulouse</a> and must travel to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/montpellier">Montpellier</a> to revive their aspirations of reaching the knockout phase.</p>
      <p>Head coach Johan Ackermann has made 11 changes with only full-back <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/jason-woodward/">Jason Woodward</a>, centre <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland/players/chris-harris/">Chris Harris</a>, number eight <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/freddie-clarke/">Freddie Clarke</a> and lock <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/gerbrandt-grobler/">Gerbrandt Grobler</a> surviving.</p>

      <p>“There’s no easy game in this group and even more so now that Montpellier also lost their first game,” Ackermann said.</p>
      <p>“They will probably want to fix that this weekend at home and we are their next opposition.</p>
      <p>“So we know that we’ll be up against a highly-motivated side. They will be under a bit of pressure.”</p>
