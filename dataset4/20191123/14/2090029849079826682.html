      <p>According to him, it is quite rare to find a woman who is exactly like his mother.</p>
      <p>He said:</p>
      <blockquote>“I wish to marry a woman like my mother, but if I compare my mother with the women I see around now, I won’t marry.<br/><br/>You can’t find her breed again. I had a picture of what she wanted for me and I would work with that.<br/><br/>She wants unity; someone that would solidify the love my siblings and I share.”</blockquote>
      <p>The comedian lost his mother in October 2019.</p>
