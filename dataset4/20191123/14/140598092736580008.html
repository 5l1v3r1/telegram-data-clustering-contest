      <h1>New Zealand tour: Prince Charles receives traditional Maori greeting and takes scenic coastal walk</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:55:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/phoebe-southworth/" target="_blank">Phoebe Southworth</a></address>
      <p>The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall petted llamas and took a picturesque coastal walk on the final leg of their New Zealand tour.</p>
      <p>Charles, 71, and Camilla, 72, absorbed the stunning sights and wildlife and spoke to locals after receiving a traditional Maori greeting during a welcoming ceremony on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The pair began the day in Christchurch, visiting Lincoln Farmers &amp; Craft Market, where Prince Charles signed the red plaster cast of young fan of the Royal Family.</p>
      <p>They then took a helicopter north to Kaikoura on South Island, which was struck by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake in 2016.</p>
      <p>Their trip risked being overshadowed by the furore surrounding Prince Andrew, who announced he will be relinquishing his public duties amid public outcry over his former friendship with the late Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

      <p>The Duke of York has been fiercely criticised for his performance in an interview with the BBC's Emily Maitlis, being accused of showing little sympathy for Epstein's victims.</p>
      <p>But Prince Charles took the scandal in his stride as he shook hands and joked with the hundreds of well-wishers who had turned out to greet him.</p>
      <p>Some said they had travelled from as far as Bath and Manchester to catch a glimpse of the royals.</p>

      <p>He went on to visit Hutton's shearwater colony in Kaikoura, one of two breeding colonies for the endangered seabird in the area, followed by a beautiful coastal walk overlooking the Pacific Ocean.</p>
      <p>Prince Charles's next stop is the Solomon Islands and he will return to the UK with Camilla on Monday.</p>
