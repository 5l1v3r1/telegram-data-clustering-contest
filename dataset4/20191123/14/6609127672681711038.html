        <b>NEIL LENNON will welcome Leigh Griffiths back for Celtic today — but warned him it’s the start of a long road to reclaiming a first-team place.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4985949/celtic-neil-lennon-scott-brown-scotland/"> Hoops</a> striker has played just one full game this season, the Champions League dead rubber against Nomme Kalju in July.</p>

      <p>But after <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4976826/celtic-leigh-griffiths-double-reserves/">hitting a double for Celts’ reserve side in a 6-0 friendly win</a> over Stenhousemuir on Tuesday, Griffiths is set to be named on the bench for today’s visit of Livingston.</p>
      <p>A return to fitness and form for Scotland ace Sparky would allow boss Lennon to give star striker Odsonne Edouard a rest as the games pile up.</p>
      <p>Lennon confirmed: “Leigh Griffiths is in the squad for Livingston. He had an hour on Tuesday, he came through that and looked fine.</p>
      <p>“He’s got to maintain that and stay on top of things, but we’re happy with the progress he’s made.</p>

      <p>“I think Leigh’s in a really good place. He seems happy, he’s fine in that regard.</p>
      <p>“He’s not missed a day’s training. He’s looking better and better as he’s going on.</p>
      <p>“At the minute Leigh’s more likely to be an impact sub than starting games until he builds up his game time and fitness levels.</p>
      <p>“He’s got to stay on top of that to get to where we can say: ‘Odsonne, have a breather, on you go, Griff’.</p>
      <p>“I think he’s had one 90 minutes this season. So it’s a question of topping up his fitness. Whether he’s playing or not, he’s got to be on top of that between games.”</p>
      <p>But while Lennon is keen to ease the load on top scorer Edouard, he admits it’s difficult to leave his top striker out.</p>
      <p>Edouard hit two penalties against Georgia and Switzerland for France’s Under-21s during the international break.</p>

      <p>Lennon added: “The great players all play, Messi was in Saudi Arabia playing for Argentina.</p>
      <p>“Firmino, Mane, Salah are the same — they play Champions League and Premier League every week.</p>
      <p>“Eventually you want to give players a break when we feel it’s necessary, but at the minute there’s no need to do that. Edouard is in brilliant form, so he’s playing</p>
      <p>“He’s one injury away, but everybody is, whether it be in training or games. If you’re comfortable in the game with 10-15 minutes to go you give him a breather.</p>
      <p>"But I want him to lead the line for as long as he wants because he does it very well.</p>
      <p>“Edouard doesn’t give much away, one of my staff said he talks to you with his eyes. You don’t know whether he’s happy or sad.</p>
      <p>“But in the main he’s very happy. He scored another couple for France during the break and that was something people maybe said he didn’t do enough of in previous years, score goals.</p>
      <p>“Edouard’s hit the ground running this season. It’s not just his goals, his all-round game’s fantastic. He’s great to watch and looks really strong, which is down to confidence.”</p>
      <p>Lennon is delighted Scotland left-back Greg Taylor, who’s also likely to be involved against Livingston with Boli Bolingoli out injured, got two full games against Cyprus and Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’m pleased with Greg full stop. I know he’s found it difficult not to be starting, but he’s trained well.</p>
      <p>“Greg’s a very good pro so I’m delighted with how things went for him with Scotland.</p>
      <p>“He knows Steve Clarke very well from his time at Kilmarnock and he’s taken the opportunity with Andy Robertson and Kieran Tierney not there.</p>

      <p>“Greg has a good understanding with James Forrest, which comes from working with him every day.</p>
      <p>“You can see Ryan Christie, Callum McGregor and Forrest having that telepathy as well for the same reasons.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got 11 games in this next block so he’ll play. It’s not like he’s completely in the wilderness.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had Bolingoli playing well, and Jonny Hayes has come in and done well.</p>
      <p>“Greg played against St Mirren. You could see he was a little bit short of match practice. But after these two games for Scotland, he should be fully up to speed so he’s ready to be picked.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Lenny admitted it would be difficult for the SPFL to agree to Steve Clarke’s request to keep the weekend before the Euro 2020 play-off semi-final against Israel clear.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celts</a> could be involved in Europa League action on Thursday, March 19. That would mean them moving their league fixture to Sunday, March 22 — just four days before Scotland play.</p>
      <p>Lennon added: “It would be good but it’s very difficult.</p>
      <p>“Scotland have a real chance of qualifying for the first time in a long time and you’d like to think everyone will be pulling the same way and giving the national team all the help they can.</p>
      <p>“But cancelling fixtures seems a difficult thing to do. I know other countries do it, they seem to find ways. But with the congestion and the inclement weather, there might be a few<br/>postponements as well.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully we’ll still be in the Europa League at that stage as well, so it’s difficult on a few fronts.”</p>
