        <b>Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, US multinational technology company, has donated $98.5 million to 32 organisations taking care of homeless families.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bezosdayonefund.org/"><b>Bezos Day One Fund</b></a>— his foundation launched in September 2018— broke news of the billionaire’s donation via social media.</p>
      <p>The $98.5 million donation for 2019 targets 32 organisations in 23 states, an improvement over that of 2018 where Bezos, the richest person in the world, donated $97.5 million to 24 organizations in 16 states.</p>
      <p>The foundation focuses on making meaningful and lasting impacts in two areas: funding existing non-profits that help families experiencing homelessness, and creating a network of new, non-profit tier-one preschools in low-income communities.</p>
      <p>Bezos, who has been sharing the world’s richest man tag with Bill Gates, Microsoft co-founder recently, also took to his social media page to express his excitement over the donation.</p>
      <p>“Excited to announce this year’s Bezos Day One grants. Thank you to these 32 organizations in 23 states working to end homelessness. I recently spent time with the amazing team at Community of Hope in Washington, D.C. – one of last year’s grantees,” he wrote on Twitter.</p>

      <p>In October, Bezos had temporarily lost his spot as the richest man status to Gates, but <a href="https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/jeff-bezos-reclaims-words-richest-man-tag-few-hours-after-losing-to-bill-gates/"><b>reclaimed</b></a> it in less than a day.</p>
      <p>This didn’t last though, as the Microsoft co-founder dislodged him last week to reclaim the spot again.</p>
