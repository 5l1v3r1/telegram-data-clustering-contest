      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-styles/">Harry Styles</a> has admitted that he is ‘uncomfortable’ with his status as a sex symbol, and was worried about discussing getting intimate during his time in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/one-direction/">One Direction</a>.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old has admitted that being considered a sex symbol can be a ‘very strange, dynamic thing’, and he also confessed to finding it ‘weird’ that people consider him attractive.</p>
      <p>‘Honestly, I’d say I try and think about it as little as possible, because it’s a very strange, dynamic thing,’ he told Zane Lowe on Apple Music’s Beats 1 Radio. ‘It’s also a weird thing to think of about yourself.’</p>
      <p>Harry also used to consider the concept of sex ‘taboo’ while he was busy topping the charts with boyband One Direction, and was worried that his public perception would change if people knew he had sex.</p>
      <p>‘I guess the thing with like sex, in general, is like, it used to feel so much more taboo for me,’ he continued.</p>

      <p>‘Even like when we were in the band, the thought of people thinking that I had sex was like, “Oh no, that’s crazy. What if they know?”’</p>
      <p>It comes after years of speculation over the singer’s sexuality, with some fans even believing he was secretly in a relationship with fellow 1D member, Louis Tomlinson.</p>

      <p>The Sign Of The Times hitmaker also previously <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/03/14/harry-styles-messes-around-boys-girls-new-song-alluding-bisexuality-7388072/">appeared to reference his bisexuality</a> in his song Medicine, which he premiered at a concert in Paris in 2018.</p>
      <p>‘The boys and the girls are in, I’ll mess around with them, and I’m OK with it,’ he sang. ‘I’m coming down, I figured I kinda like it, and when I sleep I’m gonna dream of how you tasted.’</p>
      <p>Following the premiere of the song, it was hailed as a bisexual anthem by fans.</p>
      <p>Harry also previously revealed that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/05/15/harry-styles-says-hes-never-felt-the-need-to-label-his-sexuality-6637576/">he did not feel the need to label himself.</a></p>

      <p>‘It’s weird for me – everyone should just be who they want to be. It’s tough to justify somebody having to answer to someone else about stuff like that.’</p>
