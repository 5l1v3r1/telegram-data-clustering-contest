      <p>Adolf Hitler would have been able to put anti-Semitic advertisements on <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/facebook-announces-steps-to-clamp-down-on-misinformation-ahead-of-2020-election-257494">Facebook </a>had the social network existed in the 1930s, according to British comedian and actor Sacha Baron Cohen. </p>
      <p>The 48-year-old "Ali G" star singled out the US tech giant during a searing broadside Thursday against social media companies amplifying hatred and violence as part of "the greatest propaganda machine in history."</p>
      <p>Speaking at Never Is Now, the Anti-Defamation League's New York conference on anti-Semitism and hate, he targeted Facebook for running political advertisements without fact-checking.</p>
      <p>"Under this twisted logic, if Facebook were around in the 1930s, it would have allowed Hitler to post 30-second ads on his 'solution' to the 'Jewish problem,'" Baron Cohen said as he accepted the ADL's International Leadership Award.</p>
      <p>Facebook told AFP, however, the actor had misrepresented its policies. </p>
      <p>"Hate speech is actually banned on our platform. We ban people who advocate for violence and we remove anyone who praises or supports it," a spokesperson said. </p>
      <p>"Nobody -- including politicians -- can advocate or advertise hate, violence or mass murder on Facebook." </p>
      <p>Baron Cohen's remarks came a day after Google said it would not allow political advertisers to use "microtargeting" based on user browsing data, political affiliation or other factors, including on YouTube.</p>
      <p>Google also sought to clarify its policy by indicating it does not allow "false claims" in advertising, political or otherwise.</p>
      <p>The move followed a ban by Twitter on most kinds of political ads and comes amid growing pressure on internet platforms to curb the spread of misinformation around political campaigns.</p>
      <p>Facebook, which has rejected efforts to fact-check political speech or ads, is being urged to follow suit.</p>
      <p>"So here's a good standard and practice: Facebook, start fact-checking political ads before you run them," said Baron Cohen.</p>
      <p>"Stop micro-targeted lies immediately, and when the ads are false, give back the money and don't publish them."</p>
      <p>The controversial satirist's anarchic, gonzo-style comedy has spawned celebrated TV and movie characters such as Ali G and  Borat Sagdiyev -- not to mention acclaim, the occasional lawsuit and a hatful of awards.</p>
      <p>He went on to attack Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg's characterization of the company as a bastion of "free expression." </p>
      <p>"I think we could all agree that we should not be giving bigots and pedophiles a free platform to amplify their views and target their victims," he said.</p>
