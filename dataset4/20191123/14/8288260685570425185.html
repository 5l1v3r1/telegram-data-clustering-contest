      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> are said to be "keen" on Emiliano Buendia.</p>
      <p>Sky Sports report the 22-year-old Norwich City forward has attracted the attention of Villa boss <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> ahead of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Argentine Buendia has started all 12 of Norwich's matches in the Premier League so far this season, having played a key role in their promotion to the top flight as champions of the Championship last season.</p>
      <p>The Canaries, who are rock bottom of the Premier League, bought him for £1.4m from Getafe in July 2018, Buendia signing a four-year deal at Carrow Road.</p>
      <p>Sky Sports also say <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-transfer-news-benrahma-17304645">Villa "remain interested" in Brentford winger Said Benrahma</a>, having failed to strike a deal with the Bees for the £20m-rated Algerian during the summer transfer window.</p>
