      <p>SHOPPERS are being urged to hit the streets of our towns in favour of online shopping this Christmas.</p>
      <p>The point was made by Westport-based Councillor Christy Hyland: “When you are fundraising locally for your sports club or group, Amazon won't give you a spot prize.”</p>
      <p>Businesses are facing increasing difficulties due to online shopping and he encouraged everyone to 'please shop local'.</p>
      <p>His own town, Westport, will be lit up this festive season despite some recent 'negativity' going out about the Christmas lights, he told a Westport-Belmullet MD meeting yesterday (Friday). Himself and Councillor Brendan Mulroy were providing the lights, and had given funding to the scheme every year, he pointed out.</p>
      <p>He put it to the two councillors newly elected this year – Councillor Peter Flynn and Councillor Johnny O'Malley – that they too could have allocated money by making a commitment from the monies they will receive next year.</p>
      <p>However, Councillor Flynn said as new councillors they have no budget.</p>
      <p>Councillor Paul McNamara made the point that Kilmeena-based Councillor O'Malley was being asked to commit to Newport and Westport but he had no allocation to give.</p>
      <p>Santa, he added, doesn't just arrive in Westport.</p>
