      <p>It was speculated that Matic, who has fallen down the pecking order at United under Solskjaer, would complete a move to North London following the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/news/tottenham-confirm-jose-mourinho-as-new-manager_379969.html">arrival of Mourinho.</a></p>
      <p>Matic even weighed in on the debate by liking a meme that depicted the Serbian waiting patiently for the 56-year-old to sign him.</p>
      <p>When asked about the Matic situation, Solskjaer told the <i>Metro</i>: "That's not a part of being boring when it's like this, you like Jose coming back it's gonna be a spectacle and a circus and Nemanja has a sense of humour."</p>
      <p>Mourinho has a strong working relationship with Matic having signed him during his time at both Chelsea and United.</p>
