      <h1>NFL picks, predictions against spread for Week 12: Cowboys stun Patriots; Seahawks clip Eagles; 49ers nip Packers</h1>

      <p>It's hard to believeWeek 12 already has arrived in the NFL, which means there are only six weeks left of making game picks and predictions for the 2019regular season. The prognostications both straight up and against the spread have been good so far, but a fast start needs to be backed up by a strong finish.</p>
      <p>This week, four more teams are on a bye, leaving us with another 14-game slateto navigate point spreads and game totals. After a good rebound last week, it leaves us wanting more success.</p>
      <p>Without further ado, here's our fearless forecast for the results of Week 12.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MORE NFL WEEK 12: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-standings-updated-playoff-picture-week-11/kfeltsez9gma12ne71z5rcvf2">Updated playoff picture</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-power-rankings-ravens-patriots-cowboys-colts-steelers-eagles-week-12/1dfsb3m4ostih13gvzro9e381s">Power rankings</a></b>

      <h3>NFL Week 12 picks, predictions against the spread</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Game of the Week: Green Bay Packers at San Francisco 49ers (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-2 1/2</a>)</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 8:20p.m. ET, NBC</p>
      <p>The Packers will have Aaron Rodgers and Aaron Jones coming off a bye to attack a 49ersdefense that has shown more vulnerability against offenses with athletic quarterbacks and quick backs. But Green Bay hasn't played the run well all season, and the diversity and versatility of San Francisco playing off that strength will be difficult to defend. The 49ers have more viable weapons among their backs, wideouts and tight ends for Jimmy Garoppolo than Matt LaFleur can effectively deploy for Rodgers on the road. In thisbig gameunder the spotlight, the Niners will barely have the Packers' number.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: 49ers win 30-27 and cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Game of the Midweek: Indianapolis Colts at Houston Texans (<a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=top%20bar&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-3</a>)</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thursday, 8:20 p.m. ET, Fox, NFL Network, Amazon Prime Video</p>
      <p>The Colts don't play as well on the road, especially defensively. Neither team can expect to have much traditional rushing success, so it's all about the passing games. Deshaun Watson will buy time at home to deliver some deep balls, while Jacoby Brissett will beshort on receivers who can stretch the field. Watson typically rebounds well from a bad game, and Houston's defense will overachieve a bit with the midweek emotional prime-time home bump.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Texans win 24-20 and cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Upset of the Week Dallas Cowboys (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">+7</a>) over New England Patriots</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET, Fox</p>
      <p>The Cowboys are built to beat the Patriots. They are loaded with downfield weapons and can be aggressive with a red-hot Dak Prescott, keepingNew England's defense, which can struggle against the run,honest with a good dose of Ezekiel Elliott. The Patriots' offense is struggling to run the ball and push itdeep, and Dallas is good at not giving up big plays. The only wild card in this game —and it's abig one —is Jason Garrett vs. Bill Belichick. The physical talent of the Cowboys and a fearless Kellen Moore are good upset elements, and they will make sure they start faster than Patriots.Tom Brady's team isn't set up to catch up.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Cowboys win 27-24.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Lock of the Week: New Orleans Saints (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-10 1/2</a>) over Carolina Panthers</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, CBS</p>
      <p>The Saints had that nasty wake-up call at home two weeks ago against the Falcons, and they promptly went on the road to make amends by stomping a differentdivision opponent, the Buccaneers. They won't take the Panthers lightly, even though Carolinaalso wasundressed by Atlanta. The Saints have hinted at having a monster rushing performance with Alvin Kamara and Latavius Murray, and it will comehere, as the Panthers are built better to play the pass. Kyle Allen did play well during his first shot at the Saints last season, but his pass protection and decision-making will let him down for a third consecutive week.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Saints win 38-14 and cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Miami Dolphins at Cleveland Browns (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-12</a>)</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, Fox</p>
      <p>The Browns will be without Myles Garrett, but they will have allof the core players who have contributed to their two-game winning streak, led by Baker Mayfield and Joe Schobert. They will find ways to bring the heat on Ryan Fitzpatrick and get more takeaways. On the other side, Mayfield and Odell Beckham Jr. will have their best game together with Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt tag-teaming for mighty closer work.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Browns win 34-14 and cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Denver Broncos at Buffalo Bills (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-4 1/2</a>)</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, CBS</p>
      <p>The Broncos made the Vikings sweat until the very end as evenbigger road underdogs last week with the teams trading some big plays in the passing game. This is a trickier road start for Brandon Allen in conference, and Josh Allen is known for having his best games against the weakest teams. Denver will try to make this as ugly as possible, and both defenses willbe positioned to rule these matchups. Look for a battle of attrition to break out with field goals deciding it.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Bills win 16-13 but fail to cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Pittsburgh Steelers (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-7 1/2</a>) at Cincinnati Bengals</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, CBS</p>
      <p>The Steelers' offense mightbe really shorthanded receiver-wise, and the matchup screams for arun-heavy,committee approach, evenwithout James Conner. The Bengals showed enough pride and resistance in Oakland for us to think this won't be a repeat of the Ravens game, because the Steelers aren't explosive enough to run away from them. Still, rookie QB Ryan Finley against a swarming pass defense that has Minkah Fitzpatrick lurkingdoesn't sound good.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Steelers win 20-13 but fail to cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>New York Giants at Chicago Bears (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-7</a>)</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, Fox</p>
      <p>The Bears' trustin Mitchell Trubisky has becomea true mystery after the ending of the Ramsgame, but he tends to do well againstbad pass defenses at home. Chicago will go heavy with its usage of running backs David Montgomery and Tarik Cohen to facilitate the performance of Trubisky, who will see things open upfor Allen Robinson and the rest of his wideouts downfield. This is a tough November road assignment for Daniel Jones coming off a bye, as the Bears will contain Saquon Barkley andtee off on the rookieQB in the second half.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Bears win 30-14 and cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Oakland Raiders (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-2 1/2</a>) at New York Jets</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, CBS</p>
      <p>Thisis a trap game for a 6-4, playoff-contendingteam going cross country to face a 3-7 team coming off two wins over lesser opponents. But the Raiders have traveled well in 2019, including a win in London over the Bears and a defeat of the Colts. It's easier to trust what Jon Gruden will do withhis game plan around Derek Carr and Josh Jacobs than what Adam Gase calls for around Sam Darnold and Le'Veon Bell. Carr will pick apart a bad back sevento outduel Darnold.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Raiders win 27-24and cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Atlanta Falcons (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-4</a>)</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, Fox</p>
      <p>The Falcons' defense has suddenly startedliving up to its pressure and coverage expectationsfor Dan Quinn with more healthy bodies and better communication. Jameis Winston was under plenty of duress last week and will be forced into more mistakes that take away from the big plays he makes against a shaky secondary. Matt Ryan will exploit the Bucs' bad defensive back sevenwith Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley to best what Winston does with Mike Evans and Chris Godwin.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Falcons win 30-27 but fail to cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 1p.m. ET, Fox</p>
      <p>Matt Patricia's defense has been a mess this season, but it gets a break this week against a rookie quarterback inDwayne Haskinsand an offense short on explosive players. Derrius Guice can give the Redskins a little more juice, but Jeff Driskel has proved to be a gamer, and Washington can't coverwideoutsKenny Golladay and Marvin Jones Jr. The hosts seem checked out and playing more for next year and their next head coach.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Lions win 24-20 and cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Seattle Seahawks at Philadelphia Eagles (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">Pick 'em</a>)</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, Fox</p>
      <p>The Seahawks are coming off a bye, so the travel to the East Coast won't be an issue here. Russell Wilson has the receivers to attack the Eagles' secondary downfield, assuming Tyler Lockett will be OK to play to boost DK Metcalf and a more involved Josh Gordon. Seattle got its pass rush going with Jadeveon Clowney and is now better at covering the middle of the field. Philadelphia's compressed passing game won't do much to keep up, especially with the running game being contained.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Seahawks win 24-20.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Jacksonville Jaguars at Tennessee Titans (<a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/consensus/">-3</a>)</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ETp.m. ET, CBS</p>
      <p>The Jaguars have pinned their hopes of getting out of last place in a suddenly deep AFC South onNick Foles. The Titans havebecome more vulnerable to downfield shots, but they also can control the clock and rush to another big total with Derrick Henry, who tends to dominate at home in November. (Hesmashed Jacksonville in a similar spotlast season.) There's literally no Minshew Magic a second time in this matchup, as Foles will makea critical mistake late to seal his team's fate.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Titans win 27-20 and cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Baltimore Ravens (<a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=top%20bar&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-3</a>) at Los Angeles Rams</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET, ESPN</p>
      <p>The Rams' defense has two elite players in Aaron Donald and Jalen Ramsey, but there are plenty of other holes that the Ravens can exploit with Lamar Jackson, their traditional running game and their intermediate passing game. Jared Goff isstruggling, and he faces a top secondary that now has former Ram Marcus Peters behind a revamped pass rush. Jackson will come through with plenty of his usual action, andGoff won't come up with areaction once Baltimore contains Todd Gurley.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Ravens win 23-16 and cover the spread.</p>
