      <p>At least 24 people, including seven children, have been killed by landslides triggered by unusually heavy rains in northwestern <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Kenya">Kenya</a>, a local governor said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The downpour began on Friday in West Pokot County, which borders Uganda, and worsened overnight, causing flooding and mudslides that swept away four bridges and left the worst-affected village, Muino, unaccessible by road.</p>
      <p>“More people are marooned and the entire village is at risk of being wiped out by the floods,” the county’s governor, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=John+Lonyangapuo">John Lonyangapuo</a>, said as he waited for a helicopter to transport him to survey the damage.</p>
      <p>He added that rescue efforts were underway in the area, where more than 500 vehicles are stuck on roads damaged by the landslides.</p>
      <p>Eleven of the people killed were in the same house, Mr Lonyangapuo said.</p>
      <p>Researchers have warned that warming oceans are causing unpredictable weather patterns in East Africa.</p>
      <p>Heavy rains and floods have killed more than 50 people and forced hundreds of thousands of people from their homes across East Africa, aid groups said earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Kenya is experiencing a heavier than usual rainy season, the Kenya Meteorological Department said in early November. –Reuters</p>
