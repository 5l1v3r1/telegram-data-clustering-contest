      <p>A "distressed" person was brought to safety on the Redheugh Bridge by emergency services.</p>
      <p>Police were called to the scene shortly before 1pm on Saturday afternoon to reports of a person in distress.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/traffic-travel">southbound carriageway</a> was closed for more than one hour while they dealt with the incident and buses and traffic were diverted.</p>
      <p>Traffic was heavy around Scotswood Road as drivers had to divert away from the bridge.</p>
      <p>The bridge fully reopened shortly after 2pm.</p>
