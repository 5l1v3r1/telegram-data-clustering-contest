      <p>Shigeru Miyamoto, who last month was recognised as a <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/10/nintendos_shigeru_miyamoto_to_be_recognised_as_a_person_of_cultural_merit_in_japan">Person of Cultural Merit</a> in Japan, has revealed at the same event he would one day like Nintendo to have the same level of appeal and acceptance as Disney.</p>
      <p>As reported by <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Media-Entertainment/Nintendo-s-Miyamoto-wants-to-make-Mario-the-new-Mickey-Mouse">Nikkei</a>, Miyamoto explained how the main hurdle Nintendo had to overcome before it could "seriously challenge" Disney was parents who restricted their children from enjoying video games like Super Mario.</p>
      <blockquote>Many parents want to keep their children from playing video games. But these same parents have no problem allowing them to watch Disney movies. We cannot seriously challenge [Disney] unless parents start feeling comfortable about their children playing Nintendo.</blockquote>
      <p>As a result of this, Miyamoto has resorted to other methods to capture the attention of this same market, with projects such as theme parks. This gives him the freedom to explore new scenarios with the Nintendo mascot and ensures the character lives on for future generations to enjoy. It also provides future creators with a template to help Miyamoto's creations evolve with the times â€“ just like Disney has evolved its iconic mouse over the years.</p>
      <blockquote>I've become more interested in creating greater opportunities for a larger audience to enjoy.</blockquote>
