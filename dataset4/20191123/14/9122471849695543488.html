      <h1>Joel Klatt Has Message For People Criticizing Alabama’s Schedule</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:09:08+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>In just a few hours, Alabama will take the field for a contest against an FCS opponent.</p>
      <p>Western Carolina comes to town for a battle with the Crimson Tide. It’s a nice payday for the school, but they have no chance to win the game.</p>
      <p>As for Alabama, fans across the country aren’t happy with the school’s decision to schedule a cupcake game before the Iron Bowl. Now, Auburn is doing the same – playing Samford – so the Tide aren’t alone on this front.</p>
      <p>However, that doesn’t change the fact that fans aren’t happy with Alabama’s schedule. As other top programs are playing legitimate conference games, the Tide can pick up an easy win.</p>
      <p>College football analyst Joel Klatt is just fine with that. He had a message for fans complaining about Alabama’s schedule.</p>
      <p>“Everyone is upset with Alabama for their schedule this week…However, why should they change? They shouldn’t…It’s not their job to make things equitable in CFB. If I was their AD I would do the same thing,” Klatt said.</p>

      <p>Alabama’s toughest game this season came against LSU – which the Tide lost.</p>
      <p>Now without star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, the Tide have an uphill battle to make the College Football Playoff this year.</p>
