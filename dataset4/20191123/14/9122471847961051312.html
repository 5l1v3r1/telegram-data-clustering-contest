      <h1>Steve Spurrier Reveals What Bob Stoops Told Florida State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:53:52+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>While the coaching search continues for Florida State, it appears one of the top candidates on the program’s wish list will not be taking the job. Former Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops is reportedly not interested in going to Tallahassee.</p>
      <p>Florida State moved on from Willie Taggart before he could even finish his second season at the helm. During that time he only won nine games.</p>
      <p>There have been rumors linking Stoops to the Seminoles, but it doesn’t sound as if that will come into fruition.</p>
      <p>Steve Spurrier told the <i>Orlando Sentinel </i>that Stoops is not interested in coaching college football right now. His focus is on coaching the Dallas Renegades in the XFL.</p>
      <p>From the <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/mike-bianchi-commentary/os-sp-fsu-coaching-search-steve-spurrier-bob-stoops-1123-20191122-jofafmjhq5gzbcitpgjvfrm7dy-story.html"><i>Orlando Sentinel</i>:</a></p>
      <blockquote>Spurrier, a close friend and confidante of Stoops, told me Friday that Stoops “has told FSU he’s not interested in coaching college ball” and is committed to coaching the Dallas franchise in the newly formed XFL.</blockquote>
      <p>Considering how much money Florida State spent on Taggart’s buyout, it’d be extremely disappointing if the program doesn’t land a marquee coach.</p>
      <p>Outside of Stoops, the only big name that has been linked to the job is Urban Meyer. However, it’d be an absolute stunner if the three-time national champion met with the Seminoles to discuss the job opening.</p>
      <p>Another candidate to become the next head coach at Florida State is Mike Norvell, who currently owns a 9-1 record this year with Memphis.</p>
