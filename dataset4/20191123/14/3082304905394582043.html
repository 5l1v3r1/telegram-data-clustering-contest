        <b>World number five Jon Rahm could land a huge payday in Dubai on Sunday, with two titles in his sights.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jon Rahm holds a share of the lead at the DP World Tour Championship and is on course to win the Race to Dubai title after a magnificent third round.</p>
      <p>Rahm started moving day in joint-second place with Tommy Fleetwood – also battling to be crowned European number one – and will begin his final round level with Mike Lorenzo-Vera on 15 under.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard matched his six-under opening round of 66 to catch Lorenzo-Vera at Jumeirah Golf Estates, where the leading duo hold a two-shot advantage over Rory McIlroy.</p>
      <p>Fleetwood just about had the edge in the tussle for the Race to Dubai title at the halfway mark in the final tournament of the season, but it is advantage Rahm after the Englishman signed for a two-under 70.</p>
      <p>World number five Rahm, four shots ahead of Fleetwood, will win the Race to Dubai if he repeats his 2017 triumph at the Earth Course and Bernd Wiesberger finishes lower than solo second.</p>
      <p>Wiesberger began the week as the man to catch, but is down in a share of 24th place with his chances looking slim.</p>

      <p>Second place will also be good enough for Rahm to overhaul Wiesberger if the Austrian finishes worse than solo 21st and none of Fleetwood, Shane Lowry or Matt Fitzpatrick win the title on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Rahm birdied the first two holes and hit the turn in 34 after his only bogey of the day at the eighth, then picked up another four shots on the back nine to draw level with Lorenzo-Vera.</p>
      <p>Lorenzo-Vera said he was wary of “big dogs” biting him after ending his second round with a three-shot lead and a solitary bogey at the 18th meant he had to settle for a second successive 69.</p>
      <p>Fleetwood could only muster three birdies to leave himself with work to do, while McIlroy enhanced his chances of winning the tournament for a third time by shooting a brilliant seven-under 65 – including an eagle-three at the seventh.</p>
      <p>Fitzpatrick is nine shots off the lead, with Lowry a further stroke back.</p>
