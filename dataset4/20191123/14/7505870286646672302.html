      <h1>9 new trailers you need to watch: The Irishman, Call of the Wild, Cats, and more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:01:52+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:01</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Smith</a></address>
      <p><i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</i>, <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/02/new-trailers-knives-out-jumanji-the-next-level-the-witcher/"><i>21 Bridges</i></a>, and <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/09/21/8-new-trailers-you-need-to-watch-ford-v-ferrari-knives-out-and-more/"><i>Dark Waters</i></a> are three of the new movies hitting cinemas this weekend, but all of them will just have to “let it go,” as there’s no way they’re beating <i>Frozen II</i> at the box office. The sequel so many fans of the first film have been waiting for is finally hitting theaters, and it’ll probably make a killing.</p>
      <p>I will take the unpopular route and say I’d rather watch <i>21 Bridges</i> or <i>Dark Waters</i>, but that’s just me. Over on streaming, Christmas is coming, if that wasn’t clear already. A bunch of new holiday-themed content is already streaming on Netflix, including <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/16/new-movie-trailers-6-underground-sonic-the-hedgehog-spongebob/"><i>Klaus</i></a> and <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/09/movie-trailers-2019-bad-boys-3-soul-the-banker-and-others/"><i>The Knight Before Christmas</i></a>, and even more is on the way, as you’ll see below.</p>
      <p>The brand new <i>A Christmas Carol</i> isn’t a film, yet I still added it to this week’s trailer round-up. It’s a three-part limited series that premieres on December 19th. You’ll probably want to see it. The final trailer for <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/15/martin-scorsese-the-irishman-might-hurt-at-the-oscars-after-marvel-dis/"><i>The Irishman</i></a> is also out this week, with Netflix’s film with huge Oscar aspirations set to premiere next Wednesday. And yes, there’s a new <i>Cats</i> trailer for you, as well as a Jane Austen story this week. Not to mention that Harrison Ford made an epic movie about a very good boy. You’ll see it all below:</p>
