      <p>
        <b>Neil Etheridge 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Couldn't really do anything with either of the goals conceded. Made a flurry of brilliant second-half saves.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lee Peltier 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Has to take his share of the blame for an ordinary day at the back for Cardiff City's defenders. Made a goal-saving block late on.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Aden Flint 4</b>
      </p>
      <p>Far too cumbersome in possession and too many gaps between him and Nelson. Didn't make his physicality known in the opposition box, either.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Curtis Nelson 4</b>
      </p>
      <p>Beaten far, far too easily out wide for the first goal, allowing the winger to cut inside. One half of a disjointed centre-back pairing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Joe Bennett 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Didn't do a great deal wrong and put in a couple of lovely crosses in the opposition box. A nice assist for Tomlin, too.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nathaniel Mendez-Laing 7 (star man)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Never shied away from taking on the defence and took his chance well. Getting back to his marauding best.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Marlon Pack 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>He struggled with his lack of pace to play in a midfield two and it afforded the hosts acres of space in the middle of the park.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Leandro Bacuna 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Was forced to work incredibly hard but was also culpable for the first goal. Distribution continues to improve.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Junior Hoilett 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Showed willing and creativity but his final product was definitely missing. Missed an ultimately crucial penalty, too.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>Callum Paterson 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Was unlucky not to have been awarded a penalty, but eventually won one in the second half. Otherwise relatively ineffective.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Gary Madine 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Had very little service but always made himself available and was a nuisance in the air at times.</p>
      <p>
        <b>SUBS</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Lee Tomlin (on for Hoilett) 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another brilliant cameo from the playmaker, took his chance incredibly well to level the tie.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Omar Bogle (on for Madine) 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hustled and harried in attack but had limited impact. Certainly made himself known and had a good shot blocked late one.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Will Vaulks (on for Paterson) NA</b>
      </p>
