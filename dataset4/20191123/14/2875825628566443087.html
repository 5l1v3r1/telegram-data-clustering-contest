      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/james-blunt">James Blunt</a> has admitted he heats his food up by shoving it under his armpits in a gross confession.</p>
      <p>The You’re Beautiful singer revealed he can’t stand using microwaves and that he prefers to use his own body heat to warm up his grub.</p>
      <p>He even confess his favourite meal to shove up his shirt: baked beans and sausage.</p>
      <p>Blunt, 45, uses an old technique he picked up while serving as a ­reconnaissance officer with the Army.</p>

      <p>He was taught to heat up his favourite dish by sticking it in a foil bag and then placing it under his arm.</p>
      <p>The singer told the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/james-blunt-saves-power-kitchen-20939153">Daily Star</a> : “My favourite ration was baked beans and sausage in a silver foil bag.</p>
      <p>“If you couldn’t boil it, you’d stick it under your armpit and get heat from your body. I still like it, it’s delicious.”</p>
      <p>James joined the army in 1996 and rose to the rank of captain before leaving in 2002.</p>
      <p>The five-time Grammy Award nominee and BRIT Award winner has hits like Goodbye My Lover and 1973 and is currently preparing for a world tour next year on the back of his new album Once Upon a Mind.</p>
      <p>The record has already been ridiculed by Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan, who joked he had reported it as a “hate crime.”</p>
      <p>It’s been 15 years since fans first fell in love with Blunt via his blockbuster 2004 debut album Back to Bedlam, which featured arguably his most famous song, You’re Beautiful.</p>

      <p>“I’m back where I started,” Blunt said of his new album,” the songwriter said.</p>
      <p>“Writing songs for me and the people around me. And I’m free again.”</p>
      <p>James revealed: “This album isn’t for an audience. It’s for my family and the people I need behind me when I go on tour.</p>
      <p>“So it’s really just been about exposing myself and that’s why it’s been kind of magical for me to do.”</p>
      <p>James’ socialite wife Sofia Wellesley has banned him from using items such as plastic and expensive lighting during the arena tour in a bid to save the planet.</p>
