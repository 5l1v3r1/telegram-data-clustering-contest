      <p>BRUNSWICK, Ga. (AP) — A cargo ship that capsized off the Georgia coast could remain in the sea for the next year.</p>
      <p>That’s the long-range outlook of Coast Guard Cmdr. Matt Baer, a member of the Unified Command tasked with removing the ship that capsized in September.</p>
      <p>Baer says the Golden Ray has been slowly sinking in the sand because of the powerful tides.</p>
      <p>He said the situation makes it impossible to bring the ship upright without breaking it apart and creating an even bigger problem.</p>
      <p>The cleanup effort has included divers who have removed oil and other possible contaminants from submerged storage tanks.</p>
      <p>Baer estimated about 29 miles of coastline have been impacted from leaking oil and fuel.</p>
      <p>The Brunswick News reports Baer spoke at a Brunswick-Golden Isles Chamber of Commerce meeting.</p>
