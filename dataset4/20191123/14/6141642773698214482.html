      <h2>A FUNDRAISING campaign for a young mother who has been diagnosed with late-stage aggressive lymphoma has generated more than £14,000 within hours of launching, with her friends urging Islanders to continue to show their support.</h2>

      <p>Islander Fliquet Renouf (26), who has been described by her friends as an ‘incredible friend and mother’, was diagnosed with lymphoma after going to hospital with back pain following a fall.</p>
      <p>After undergoing tests it was confirmed that Miss Renouf had multiple aggressive tumours which had spread to her spine, lungs, liver and spleen.</p>
      <p>The mother-of-one and tattoo artist was this week flown to Southampton to receive treatment following her shock diagnosis. According to one of her friends, the young Islander is said to be more concerned about the welfare of her seven-year-old daughter, Dakota, and her partner, Ben. Close friend Serena Fan (27) said Miss Renouf had complained about being in a lot of pain for over a year. And despite a number of appointments and tests, her symptoms were diagnosed as chronic pain and inflammatory problems, according to Miss Fan.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘I remember Fliq telling me that the pain in her back had become so bad that she once pulled up the hand break of her car and said it felt like boiling water was being poured down her back.’</p>
      <p>Benjamin Pearce, Miss Renouf’s partner, said: ‘We are overwhelmed with the support and love we have received for my ultra-strong girlfriend Fliquet. A huge thank you to everyone who has donated to help us keep down the fort in Jersey while she tackles cancer in Southampton.’</p>
      <p>The JustGiving page set up by her friends on Thursday night had raised £14,060 of a £15,000 target as of yesterday evening.</p>
      <p>A statement on the page said: ‘Fliq is going to have to be off Island until at least the end of the year, being in Southampton over the time of her birthday and Christmas.</p>
      <p>‘She has had to leave her family behind and unfortunately the lack of income is causing further stress as they’re [Fliquet and her partner] struggling to cover rent and bills, along with trying to raise funds so they can fly out to be with her.</p>
      <p>‘Due to the aggressive nature of the cancer she will be on intensive chemotherapy, steroid mass reduction therapy and radiotherapy. However, due to the size of one of the tumours on her chest, she cannot be upright, as it restricts her airflow, along with causing further pain, meaning she must be on permanent bed rest.’</p>
