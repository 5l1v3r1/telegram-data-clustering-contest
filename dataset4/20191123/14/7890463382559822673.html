      <h1>Deathgarden: Bloodharvest bids farewell by going free-to-play</h1>

        <b>A multiplayer-only game is always gambling on its ability to maintain enough players to keep itself running, and unfortunately, Behaviour Digital’s <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/deathgarden/deathgarden-closed-alpha">Deathgarden: Bloodharvest</a> has struggled to do that. Despite having some genuinely interesting ideas, and coming from the developers of <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/dead-by-daylight">Dead By Daylight</a>, Deathgarden will see no further updates as the development team moves on to other projects.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Behaviour posted a note to the game’s Steam page titled ‘<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/555440/announcements/detail/1606025716087811818">A Final Letter to the Community</a>‘ Friday, explaining the decision to cease development on Deathgarden.</p>
      <p>“Today, it is with a heavy heart that we’re announcing the end of Deathgarden’s development,” it reads. “To honour the production team’s work, we have decided to give the game a meaningful last breath by finalizing every feature we’ve been working on.”</p>
      <p>Behaviour will be holding a good-bye livestream December 12 at 15:00 EST / 20:00 GMT at its <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/deathgardengame">Twitch page</a>, during which players will be able to play Deathgarden with the developers. And anyone can play, because Deathgarden is now free to play, and will be until the servers eventually go dark.</p>
      <p>It’s a bit tragic for Behaviour to have to pull the plug on a promising project, particularly right as it leaves early access. As Rock Paper Shotgun notes, the latest patch adds three new maps to the mix, namely Legionis Rest, Citadel, and Barren City.</p>
      <p>If you decide to hop in to try it out, you’ll be able to pick up all the in-game items for one Blood, which is the currency you earn by playing matches. Everything is free except for the Terminator pack, which likely has certain pricing requirements tied to the license.</p>
      <p>Deathgarden’s servers will stay up “at least through the end of the year,” Behaviour writes, and you’ll be able to keep playing as long as matchmaking is viable. And until the servers close down for good, everyone’s invited to the Bloodharvest. You can download and play it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/555440/Deathgarden_BLOODHARVEST/">via Steam</a>.</p>
