      <h1>Liverpool Confirmed lineup vs Crystal Palace: Robertson fit to start; Ox in for Salah</h1>

        <b>Jurgen Klopp has opted to start Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in attack in the absence of Mohamed Salah as Liverpool take on Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alisson continues in goal for Liverpool. The backline remains unchanged as well, with Dejan Lovren partnering Virgil van Dijk. The Dutchman withdrew from Netherlands duty due to personal reasons but starts for Liverpool against Crystal Palace.</p>

      <p>Joel Matip and Joe Gomez are injured, which gives Lovren a chance to impress Klopp. Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson assume their usual roles on extreme sides of the back four. Robertson was a doubt but seems to have cleared the late fitness test to be picked by Klopp.</p>
      <p>In midfield, we see Jordan Henderson be fit in time to start for Liverpool. Alongside the Englishman, we have Fabinho and Georginio Wijnaldum, both of whom featured for their respective international teams during the midweek.</p>
      <p>Mohamed Salah is only fit enough to make the bench and was expected to either be replaced by Xherdan Shaqiri or Divock Origi. But, to everyone’s surprise, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain starts in attack, with Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane completing the Liverpool starting XI.</p>
