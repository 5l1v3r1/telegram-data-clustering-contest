      <h2>The midfielder picked up his fifth booking of the season against Leganes</h2>

      <p>Sergio Busquets picked up his fifth booking of the season on Saturday against Leganes for a late challenge on Roque Mesa in the first half.</p>
      <p>The Barcelona midfielder will, therefore, miss next weekend's tough trip to Atletico Madrid in the league through suspension.</p>
      <p>Busquets started at Leganes as part of a two-man midfield, alongside Frenkie de Jong, as Ernesto Valverde opted for a 4-2-3-1 formation.</p>
      <p>The Spain international didn't have the best afternoon, though, getting booked before being taken off early in the second half for Ivan Rakitic.</p>
      <p>At that point, Valverde switched to a midfield three, with De Jong and Rakitic joined by Arturo Vidal, who replaced forward Antoine Griezmann.</p>
      <p>Barcelona won the game 2-1 thanks to goals from Luis Suarez and Vidal to remain top of the table with 28 points.</p>
