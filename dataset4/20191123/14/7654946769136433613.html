      <p>China’s top diplomat accused the United States of creating international instability and slandering China.</p>
      <p>“The United States is broadly engaged in unilateralism and protectionism, and is damaging multilateralism and the multilateral trading system. It has already become the world’s biggest destabilizing factor,” Chinese state State Councillor Wang Yi said during a meeting of G20 foreign ministers in Japan, Reuters reported.</p>
      <p>“Certain U.S. politicians have smeared China everywhere in the world, but have not produced any evidence.” Wang added.</p>
      <p>Relations between the United States and China are at historic lows as both countries remain locked in a trade war. Tensions were further inflamed after the U.S. House of Representatives passed two bills this week offering support to pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.</p>
