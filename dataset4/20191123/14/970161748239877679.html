      <p>Perhaps you left work early when Morrisons rolled out <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/04/nutella-fans-assemble-morrisons-selling-1kg-jar-just-4-10516039/">1kg jars of Nutella</a> in August. Maybe you even <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/12/16/this-hair-salon-dyed-a-womans-hair-using-nutella-and-condensed-milk-6326467/">drizzled the spread over your hair</a> because a hairdresser on the net said it would add shine.</p>
      <p>No matter how many Nutella-related quests you’ve carried out, we bet it doesn’t come close to this one.</p>
      <p>In early 2020, an official Nutella hotel is opening in the US. Hotella Nutella (<i>of course</i>) will be a pop-up getaway experience offered on the weekend of January 10-12.</p>
      <p>It’s set to open in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/04/27/you-can-go-on-a-train-around-napa-valley-drinking-nothing-but-tequila-7503045/">Napa Valley</a>, the world-renowned Californian wine region where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daGlbua1fa0">Kris Jenner once got absurdly drunk</a> and where Netflix comedy <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/11/netflixs-latest-film-wine-country-reunites-favourite-funny-women-obsessed-9175553/">Wine Country</a> was set.</p>
      <p>For those who favour <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/05/muji-hotel-opens-japan-minimalist-dream-9120090/">toned-down, minimalist interiors</a> to relax, Hotella Nutella might not be your first choice. As you can see, it resembles one of the chambers of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/12/03/spicy-willy-wonka-theory-suggests-violet-should-have-won-the-chocolate-factory-8202454/">Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory</a>, minus the horrific child injuries and disappearances.</p>

      <p>Considering most Nutella-lovers are into excess – spooning the spread right out of the jar, and what have you – we’d imagine the lodgings are perfectly to their taste.</p>

      <p>During the stay, guests will get to enjoy massive Nutella jars and themed décor including alarm clocks, furniture and bedding including fluffy croissant pillows.</p>

      <p>Iron Chef’s Geoffrey Zakarian will serve up Nutella-based meals for dinner, while professional chef Tanya Holland will create a Southern-style savoury brunch using a little spread we like to call… Nutella.</p>
      <p>‘Hotella Nutella reimagines the joy of the hotel stay with a special breakfast experience that allows fans to enjoy Nutella in new and different ways,’ Todd Midura, vice president of marketing at Ferrero, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>To wrap up the weekend, pancake art team <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2015/08/24/guy-turns-75-of-your-favourite-pixar-characters-into-pancakes-and-its-epic-5357825/">Dancakes</a> will create mesmerising pancake portraits using edible batter and possibly a certain choc-hazelnut spread.</p>

      <p>Curiously enough, entry to Hotella Nutella is a bit of a Willy Wonka kind of deal, with the accommodation available to just three people and their guests.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the competition is only open to US residents. If you fit the bill, record a one-minute video showing how Nutella ‘makes your morning special’ and submit it at <a href="https://hotellanutella.com/">www.HotellaNutella.com</a>. Applications close on Sunday 8 December 2019.</p>
