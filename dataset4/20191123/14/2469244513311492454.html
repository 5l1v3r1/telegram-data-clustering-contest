      <p>It's a well known fact that exercise benefits our physical health, but one group of mountain bikers are proof that the sport has life- changing benefits for our mental health too.</p>
      <p>Based in Exeter, the Fair To Middling mountain biking group was set up in by Tom Howe, to bring together people from all walks of life struggling with mental health, and the general hardships of life.</p>
      <p>Tom said: "It came about because in 2009, on September 22, I had a brain hemorrhage meaning I had to leave my military career behind. For years I'd been hiding post traumatic stress symptoms."</p>

      <p>In 2017, when Tom's wife was expecting their daughter, Tom realised he needed some help. He found mountain biking helped his mental health, but said: "There was no real group I could go to. I wanted the social aspect- somewhere to share ideas."</p>
      <p>Tom went on to form Fair To Middling in 2018. The aim of the group is to use mountain biking to to increase wellbeing, to form friendships and to learn new skills.</p>
      <p>The group consists of a race team and a mountain biking club, and welcomes new members and beginners. They cycle and train in beautiful places such as Haldon Forest and Woodbury Common.</p>
      <p>The cyclists also raise money for cancer charity, Force and the mental health charity, Mind. In January, the race team be will taking part in the tough Strathpuffer winter mountain biking race, in freezing temperatures and 17 hours of darkness-hoping to raise £5000 for charity.</p>
      <p>Nick Gunn, 57, is a founder member of the group, and a former Royal Marine. He served for 11 years, in places such as the Falklands and Northern Ireland- experiences which left him with severe and complex post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He says that being part of the biking group has changed his life and helped him to cope with his condition.</p>

      <p>Nick said: "I was unfortunate to be in the thick of the action in the Falklands and was lucky to get through alive. After providing air defence for weeks in San Carlos bomb alley, the ship I was on finally moved to Bluff Cove. I was blown up by an Argentine bomb on the Sir Tristram [ship], after a short check over by the medics, I took part in the fierce battle for Stanley." </p>
      <p>The following year, Nick was deployed to Northern Ireland and experienced further trauma. He said: "I was at the front of my patrol when an improvised explosive device exploded about 20 metres in front, knocking us down and sending us flying. I remember coming to in the smoke and debris and thinking, 'Am I alive or dead?' </p>
      <p>On returning home, Nick began to experience further problems, he said: "Drinking, fighting, endless anger and sleepless nights began. In those days in the Marines there was no asking for help you just got back on with the job. The anger and hyper-vigilance were good."</p>

      <p>Nick said it took him a number of years to seek professional help, he said: "I was in real danger of losing my wife, Helen, my drinking was spiralling as were my angry moods, and terrible nightmares, so I visited my doctors and admitted I had problems." </p>
      <p>He underwent assessment, counselling and intense therapy and was eventually diagnosed with chronic complex PTSD. </p>
      <p>Some of Nick's treatment has worked short term, he said: "Some have caused the nightmares and flashbacks to be less frequent and my mood to stabilise. But everyday is still a struggle, the war still wages in my head, my memory is terrible, my moods swing back and forth and my sleep is often troubled- certain smells and sounds trigger terrible thoughts."</p>

      <p>Despite his struggles, Nick has seen a real benefit to being part of Fair To Middling, he said: "I feel happier and more focused. Yes, I still battle my demons, but when I’m riding through the woods, in the mud or hills, concentrating on that fast downhill descent or seemingly impossible climb, my mind let’s me rest, and the battle in my head pauses a while.</p>
      <p>"It’s amazing how relaxing and satisfying it is being out on my bike in the woods, or up a mountain just me and nature and freedom from the constant pressure of life.</p>
      <p>"Finding mountain biking at the ripe age of 56 was a game changer for me, and having the team to ‘bounce’ off, and the support we provide each other is fantastic. Mountain biking and Team Fair to Middling have helped change my life."</p>
      <p>However, Fair To Middling groups aren't just for men. In fact Tom said they'd encourage more women to experience the benefits of mountain biking.</p>

      <p>Nicky Jeffery, 49, is one woman to have benefited from being a part of the group. Nicky, from Kennford, is mother to two daughters who both have severe learning difficulties. She said: "My eldest daughter also has complex medical needs and our youngest daughter, who we adopted when she was 3 years old, has significant mental health difficulties.</p>
      <p>"As a carer I have always valued cycling and running outdoors as a vital part of maintaining my own mental well being. It gives me clear headspace, is stress relieving and gives me a feeling of inner confidence.</p>
      <p>"I find mountain biking in particular has the added benefit of being great fun and it is a very social sport. When I'm mountain biking, I'm so busy concentrating on the trail that I don't have time to think about anything else. It's like active mindfulness, with bonus endorphins from the exercise!</p>

      <p>"As well as the benefits to me personally, Fair to Middling cycling club wants to raise awareness of the benefits of mountain biking for mental health and well being. Many studies have shown that this sport is particularly good because of the positive effects of exercising in beautiful countryside settings. The social aspect, riding with your mates, is also an important part of these benefits.</p>
      <p>"I love that Fair to Middling is about inclusivity and sharing the benefits of mountain biking in a really supportive way-I believe we could really make a difference to the lives of people facing mental health challenges."</p>
      <p>Allthough the Fair To Middling race team do take part in some tough challenges, Nicky said members can also just benefit from being outdoors. She said: "Mountain biking doesn’t have to be all about the adrenaline rush and going fast. The ethos of our club is about encouraging people to get outdoors and blow some cobwebs away at the same time as making friends.</p>
      <p>"We’re an inclusive club, everyone is welcome and we all support one another both on and off the bike. We know that riding our bikes away from the hustle and bustle is great for our mental and physical health and we want to share that with as many people as possible.’</p>
