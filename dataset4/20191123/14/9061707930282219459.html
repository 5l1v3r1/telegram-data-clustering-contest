      <p>We're coming up to Christmas and the temptation is to treat our pets too.</p>
      <p>And that often stretches to give the dog titbits from what we've been eating - but there are some foods that are very harmful to dogs.</p>
      <p>There are things that we love but can make our pets very ill indeed. Be strong, don't fall for those cow eyes as you may live to regret it if your pet falls ill.</p>
      <p>Things like nuts, cheese and onions are among the potentially harmful human foods that should never be fed to our pets, according to experts from Dog food specialists <a href="http://tracking.vuelio.co.uk/tracking/click?d=r5wKIy-Ot6ZZz_k1vv5d0ZWV2FUoVytoxcDuMDQkTmN8KGwC8nITpDgUsmpliOLgkef34nda-K4sr9wAePHKK6jMphcPPQfNAM2Bz3aqGfDjDQ0ln02qVnWzckkmLnkh5aAbXbc-0R8gq4ZyhwIS2kfmcCNEEtUOQTunCqwSyCZn4hirctE0trOgowt41g8sqB6L3qjevn8iiNKt_MjRu5g1">PurePetFood.co.uk</a>.</p>
      <p>The experts have run through the snacks and ingredients that could prove dangerous if eaten by our dogs and have explained why they should be kept away from our four legged friends.</p>
      <p>Some human food can cause health problems in dogs which can range from toilet issues and vomiting to heart disease, liver failure and even death, depending on the contents.</p>
      <p>Many people know not to give their pet dog chocolate, but there are other foods to avoid include tea, garlic and grapes.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for PurePetFood.co.uk said: "Many pet owners like to give their dog leftovers, a chance to lick their plate, or a bit of human food as a treat every so often.</p>
      <p>"But many of our favourite snacks can have dangerous consequences for our four-legged friends, due to some of the chemicals and ingredients they contain.</p>
      <p>"To help dog lovers avoid causing harm to pups and canines, we've revealed 11 things they shouldn't be allowed to eat and why."</p>
      <p>If your dog starts to display symptoms of eating something they shouldn't have, contact your vet immediately.</p>

      <h3>Do not feed these foods to your dog</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>1. Chocolate</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article3081375.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_Dont-feed-these-foods-to-your-dog.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>This is the one human food most people know dogs shouldn't consume and dark chocolate is even worse than the milkier variety.</p>
          <p>It is because chocolate contains methylxanthines and theobromine which could mess up a canine's insides by causing vomiting, diarrhoea and excessive urination, panting and thirst, an abnormal heartbeat, seizures or even death.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>2. Alcohol</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article3081363.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_Dont-feed-these-foods-to-your-dog.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>Alcohol can have similar effects to chocolate and also cause abnormal blood acidity, central nervous system depression, decreased coordination or even coma in dogs.</p>
          <p>Pets should never be allowed to consume any products containing toxic alcohol and a vet needs to be contacted urgently if you think they may have ingested some.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>3. Grapes and raisins</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article3081324.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_Dont-feed-these-foods-to-your-dog.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>Scientists have been unable to identify the toxic substance contained in grapes and raisins, but it is known they could cause kidney failure and shouldn't be fed to dogs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>4. Cheese</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article3081391.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_Dont-feed-these-foods-to-your-dog.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>High fat, high calorie food can be bad for pets if eaten excessively by causing weight gain, which can lead to lots of other health problems.</p>
          <p>Most cheeses are also very salty, meaning eating too much could eventually bring on heart disease or stroke in your dog.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>5. Onion</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article3081302.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_Dont-feed-these-foods-to-your-dog.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>Chemicals in onions can cause dogs' red blood cells to rupture or reduce how effectively they can carry oxygen around their body, whether the vegetable is cooked or raw.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>6. Ready meals</h4>
          <p>Excessive salt can harm dogs just like humans. It could cause increased thirst, raise blood pressure, or even sodium ion poisoning in pets, so it's best not to let them lick your plate after you've had a ready meal or other high salt foods like crisps and processed snacks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>7. Nuts</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article3081310.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_Dont-feed-these-foods-to-your-dog.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>Almonds, cashews, pecans, pistachios and other nuts are packed full of fats and oils that could lead to diarrhoea, vomiting and pancreatitis in dogs.</p>
          <p>Macadamias meanwhile can cause a range of other problems in pets too, including weakness, tremors, depression and even hyperthermia.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>8. Xylitol</h4>
          <p>Used as a sweetener in a range of products including chewing gum, toothpaste and baked desserts, xylitol can cause insulin release in dogs and potentially lead to liver failure. If you are brushing your dog's teeth make sure you use dog friendly toothpaste.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>9. Tea and Coffee</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article3081334.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_Dont-feed-these-foods-to-your-dog.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>A tiny sip or two is unlikely to do major damage but drinking much of a morning cuppa could be life-threatening for dogs so it's best to keep your pet away from hot beverages.</p>
          <p>Caffeine could be very harmful to your dog as it's a methylxanthine, like the chemicals found in chocolate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>10. Garlic</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article3081257.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_Dont-feed-these-foods-to-your-dog.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>Like onions, garlic contains chemicals that can damage red blood cells and negatively affect dogs' overall health, raw or cooked.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>11. Olive oil</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article3081350.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_Dont-feed-these-foods-to-your-dog.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>Like most oils, olive oil is high in both fat and calories and could therefore cause harmful weight gain in dogs if lots is given to them over time.</p>
          <p>It may also cause digestive problems for pets and lead to vomiting or diarrhoea if consumed in excessive amounts.</p>
