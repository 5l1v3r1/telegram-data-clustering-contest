      <p>While <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Priyanka-Chopra">Priyanka Chopra</a> is currently in Mumbai due to her professional commitments, she attended a friends party last night and posed with several celebs like <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bhumi-Pednekar">Bhumi Pednekar</a>, Tahira Kashyap and others but what grabbed our attention was the presence of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Katrina-Kaif">Katrina Kaif</a> too in the frame.</p>
      <p>While the pictures made their way on the internet earlier in the day, Katrina shared a stunning selfie clicked by PeeCee which also featured Arpita Khan Sharma and captioned it as "Girls .......ðŸ’›"</p>

      <p>While Kat stepped into PeeCee's shoes in her last outing 'Bharat' which also starred <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Salman-Khan">Salman Khan</a> after the '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Baywatch">Baywatch</a>' actress stepped out of the film owing to some personal reason, several reports of a rift between the leading actresses had made their way on the internet. But looks like this selfie is an answer of their growing bond which the fans would definitely love to see on the silver screen as well.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, on the professional front, Katrina is currently gearing up for her next release 'Sooryavanshi' which is a cop drama directed by Rohit Shetty and would also feature <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Akshay-Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a>. On the other hand, PeeCee was last seen in Shonali Bose's 'The Sky is Pink' opposite <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Farhan-Akhtar">Farhan Akhtar</a>, Zaira Wasim and Rohit Saraf.</p>
