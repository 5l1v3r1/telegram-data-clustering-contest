      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/meghan-markle/">Meghan Markle</a> was left ‘troubled’ by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a>’s ‘car crash’ interview, it has been claimed.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York stepped down from royal duties this week after his BBC interview was dubbed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-interview-described-nuclear-explosion-level-bad-11169720/">‘nuclear explosion level bad’</a>.</p>
      <p>His nephew’s wife is said to have been uncomfortable by the manner in which he dismissed allegations that he had sex with a teenager, according to The Sun.</p>
      <p>A friend of Meghan’s also allegedly told the Telegraph that the interview had ‘left everyone watching it wanting to curl up under a table. It just got worse and worse and worse’.</p>
      <p>At one point, the reporter asked the royal if he had ever had sex with Virginia Giuffre Roberts or ‘any young woman trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein’.</p>

      <p>He replied denying the allegation, saying he would have recalled the encounter if he had done because ‘sex for a man is a positive act’.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘No and without putting too fine a point on it, if you’re a man it is a positive act to have sex with somebody.</p>

      <p>‘You have to take some sort of positive action and so therefore if you try to forget it’s very difficult to try and forget a positive action and I do not remember anything.’</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew also came under fire for claiming he couldn’t have slept with Mrs Giuffre because he had taken daughter Princess Beatrice to a party at Pizza Express the day his accuser claimed it happened.</p>
      <p>He dismissed claims that he was sweating profusely during the nightclub encounter because he had a ‘peculiar medical condition’ that meant he could not sweat, caused by an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War.</p>
      <p>His daughter Beatrice and Eugenie have reportedly vowed to support him after he was sacked by the Queen, according to the Mirror.</p>
      <p>A friend of the York sisters said: ‘They have both been extremely resolute and told Andrew they will support him in any way they can.</p>
      <p>‘They have their passions and causes which they successfully manage, but are two ambitious women who can stand on their own.</p>
      <p>‘It’s been very much a case of keep calm and carry on for them both.</p>

      <p>The royal has reportedly resigned from his role with his flagship business project Pitch@Palace after business sponsors KPMG, Standard Chartered and Inmarsat all allegedly said they would not renew their financial support.</p>
      <p>A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman would not comment on reports the duke had stepped down.</p>
      <p>Barclays, a partner of the project, also ended its association on Friday, while the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) was among a number of other organisations which announced on Friday they would no longer be involved with Prince Andrew.</p>
