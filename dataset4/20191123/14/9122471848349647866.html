      <h1>Desmond Howard Reminds Everyone That Chase Young Was Suspended</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:49:54+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday morning, ESPN’s College GameDay kicked off from Columbus ahead of a massive game between No. 2 Ohio State and No. 8 Penn State.</p>
      <p>Before the game begins, the crew broke down the day’s slate of games and other college football-related topics. At one point during the show, the crew talked about the Heisman Trophy candidates taking the field this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Ohio State has three potential Heisman candidates – quarterback Justin Fields, running back J.K. Dobbins and defensive end Chase Young. The conversation turned to Young, who missed two games while serving a suspension.</p>
      <p>Former Michigan star and College GameDay analyst Desmond Howard made sure to remind everyone that Young was suspended. A fellow analyst said Young “missed” two games, but still had incredible numbers.</p>
      <p>“I think u said ‘miss 2 games,’ he was suspended 2 games,” Howard corrected.</p>

      <p>Ohio State fans obviously noticed Howard’s decision to correct his colleague.</p>
      <p>Young served his time and will be back for a huge game against Penn State this afternoon. Nittany Lions quarterback Sean Clifford might be running for his life in a few hours.</p>
