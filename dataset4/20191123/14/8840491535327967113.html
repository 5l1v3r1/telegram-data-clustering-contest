      <p>THE Waits, one of Castlebar's oldest traditions dating back over 150 years, is to be revived for one night only.</p>
      <p>It will take place in the town centre on Friday night, December 20, at 8 p.m. and will pass through Rush Street, Main Street and a section of Ellison Street.</p>
      <p>It is being conducted by Stephen Guthrie and accordanist Michael Corcoran with all proceeds are in aid of Mayo Roscommon Hospice.</p>
      <p>Families from around the town will fondly recall the tradition which died away a number of year ago in which the sound of ‘Silent Night’ on the accordion slowly passed houses as their family names were being called out in the dead of night.</p>
      <p>This tradition was special for younger members of households as it was so associated with Christmas.</p>
      <p>In times gone by parents would wake up children at 2 a.m. to hear the sounds of 'The Waits' breaking the silence of the night with warm greetings which included with the words: “On a cold and frosty morning.”</p>
      <p>Stephen Guthrie, Dessie Dunne, Joe Geraghty, Paddy Clarke, Pakie Forde, a Mr. McCormack, and not forgetting Paddy Gannon, who did it for one year, are all names associated with this great unique piece of Castlebar history.</p>
      <p>People who remember those legendary times are encouraged to join the crowds that will come out on the evening.</p>
      <p>It will start at Moran’s pub on Rush Street at 8 p.m. and proceed The Irish House at Ellison Street for a musical finale with the Castlebar Concert Band.</p>
      <p>So gather your children and grandchildren and come and be part of that 150-year-old tradition once again.</p>
