        <i>• Arturo Vidal caps La Liga champions’ comeback at Leganés<br/>• Tight at top of Bundesliga after shock Mönchengladbach loss</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Barcelona</b> came from behind to snatch a 2-1 victory at La Liga’s basement club <b>Legan</b><b>és </b>as the substitute Arturo Vidal struck a scrappy late winner.</p>
      <p>It was another unconvincing display away from home from the champions and Leganés had taken the lead in their coach Javier Aguirre’s first home game in charge thanks to a superb strike into the top corner from Youssef En-Nesyri in the 12th minute.</p>
      <p>Leganés then spurned two chances to extend their advantage before the break before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona">Barcelona</a> levelled in the 52nd minute when Luis Suárez glanced in Lionel Messi’s free-kick.</p>
      <p>Barcelona won the game thanks to a fortunate goal in the 79th minute from the Chile midfielder Vidal, who was in a clear offside position when he knocked in from close range but a VAR review allowed the goal to stand as the ball had bounced off Leganés’ Rubén Pérez.</p>
      <p>In Germany <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayernmunich">Bayern Munich</a> made up some vital ground on Borussia Mönchengladbach to bring themselves within a point of the Bundesliga leaders. <b>Bayern </b>cruised to a 4-0 win over <b>Düsseldorf</b>, Philippe Coutinho and Serge Gnabry among the goals, while <b>Mönchengladbach</b>’s<b> </b>shock 2-0 defeat at <b>Union Berlin </b>leaves one point separating the top three after <b>RB Leipzig</b>’s 3-1 win over <b>FC Koln </b>took them to second.</p>
      <p>In Italy <b>Juventus </b>stretched their lead at the top of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball">Serie A</a> to four points for at least a few hours with a 3-1 win at <b>Atalanta</b>, Gonzalo Higuaín’s double and a Paulo Dybala strike all coming in the final 20 minutes to complete a late turnaround. <b>AC Milan </b>and <b>Napoli </b>played out a 1-1 draw, while Inter have the chance to reduce Juventus’ lead to a point at Torino on Saturday evening.</p>
