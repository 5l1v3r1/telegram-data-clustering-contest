      <p>The Switzerland international was stripped of the captaincy after a public outburst in which he told Arsenal fans to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/result/result-var-denies-arsenal-winner-after-unai-emerys-side-blow-two-goal-lead_376502.html">"f*** off"</a> during a 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace last month.</p>
      <p>Reports have <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/transfer-talk/news/arsenal-to-sell-granit-xhaka-in-january_377902.html">strongly suggested</a> that Xhaka, who has not played a Premier League game since the incident, will leave the club over the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the dressing room environment at the Emirates, Bellerin told <i>The Sun</i>: "It's been hard as a player in the dressing room to deal with these situations.</p>
      <p>"I think it's important as a club, as everything being divided is never the way forward. I think the [right] way is accepting who we are, what we have, getting everyone together, supporting each other, and that is the way that we can reach our goals."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/transfer-talk/news/milan-clubs-in-pole-position-for-xhaka_380047.html">It is claimed</a> that AC Milan are favourites to sign Xhaka, although Newcastle United are also said to be interested in bringing the midfielder to the club on a loan basis.</p>
      <p>Members of the Arsenal dressing room are said to be <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/news/arsenal-players-angry-at-emery-for-not-backing-xhaka_376739.html">angry</a> at manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/unai-emery/"><b>Unai Emery</b></a> for his handling of the Xhaka situation.</p>
