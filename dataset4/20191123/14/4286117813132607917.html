      <p>The NCP on Saturday evening removed Ajit Pawar as the party's legislature unit leader after he joined hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and took oath as the deputy chief minister of Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>State Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Jayant Patil will have all the constitutional rights till the next legislature party leader is elected.</p>
      <p>Jayant Patil said, <b>"Our MLAs will be back. We tried establishing contact with Ajit Pawar, we will be happy if he returns."</b></p>
      <p>Jayant Patil said that the NCP has 42 MLAs and they are in touch with seven of them.</p>
      <p><b>"Fadnavis will fail the floor test for sure,"</b> Jayant Patil said.</p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar, the NCP chief Sharad Pawar's nephew, had been elected as the legislature party leader on October 30 following the results of the Maharashtra Assembly elections.</p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar's right to issue a whip were also revoked. The party authorized Sharad Pawar and Jayant Patil to decide its stand in light of the developments.</p>
      <p>The dramatic swearing-in of Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) Devendra Fadnavis as chief minister and Sharad Pawar's nephew Ajit Pawar as his deputy was preceded by days of talks between key party leaders and the junior Pawar, who was facing probe in corruption cases being investigated by central agencies.</p>
      <p><b>NOTE:</b> <i>Story's earlier version carried Dilip Walse taking over Ajit Pawar's post but amended report says Jayant Patil has replaced Ajit Pawar as NCP legislative party leader and not Dilip Walse Patil. The story has been updated as per the latest report.</i></p>
