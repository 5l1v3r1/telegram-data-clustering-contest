      <h1>ESPN’s Paul Finebaum Makes His Pick For Ohio State-Penn State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:10:35+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The biggest game on college football’s Week 13 slate is taking place in Columbus, Ohio. The undefeated Ohio State Buckeyes are hosting Penn State at Ohio Stadium.</p>
      <p>Today’s contest is essentially a Big Ten Championship Game play-in game. Ohio State clinches the Big Ten East with a win, while Penn State would just need to beat Rutgers next week (which is a virtual lock).</p>
      <p>Ohio State enters today’s game as a sizable favorite.</p>
      <p>ESPN college football analyst Paul Finebaum made his pick for the game.</p>
      <h3>The SEC guru is taking Ohio State to beat Penn State today, he said on SportsCenter. The Buckeyes will move to 11-0 with a win over the Nittany Lions.</h3>
      <p>Ohio State will have Chase Young back for this afternoon’s contest. He appears to be ready to go.</p>
