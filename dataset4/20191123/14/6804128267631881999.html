      <h1>Crystal Palace vs Liverpool confirmed line ups: Mo Salah benched as Eagles go unchanged</h1>
      <h2>Roy Hodgson had a full compliment of players to choose but Jurgen Klopp has made a change</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:07:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:07</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Trotter</a></address>
      <p>Roy Hodgson has named the same team that lost to Chelsea to face Liverpool at Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>The Eagles come into the clash with no injury worries as the former Fulham boss was able to name his strongest side.</p>
      <p>Wilfried Zaha had <a href="https://www.football.london/crystal-palace-fc/fixtures-results/palace-wilfried-zaha-boost-liverpool-17300675">been a doubt</a> after he picked up a knock to his foot at Stamford Bridge but Hodgson was confident ahead of the match.</p>
      <p>He said: "We were concerned about Wilf Zaha. His foot which forced him out of match for the Ivory Coast has improved. We think he will be fit for tomorrow and the same for the rest of the squad.</p>
      <p>"It's an achievement, our sports science and medical team deserve a pat on the back at this stage of the season. To be a third of the way through and have all of our outfield players available."</p>
      <p>He has been judged fit to start along with Joel Ward who had picked up a groin injury against Chelsea.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.football.london/crystal-palace-fc/crystal-palace-liverpool-team-news-17301463">big questions</a> at Selhurst Park were whether Jurgen Klopp would be able to start with Andrew Robertson and Mohamed Salah.</p>
      <p>The duo both missed games during the international period and the latter has had to settle for a place on the bench.</p>
      <p>Crystal Palace XI: Guaita; Ward, Tomkins, Cahill, van Aanholt; Kouyate, Milivojevic, McArthur; Townsend, Ayew, Zaha</p>
      <p>Subs: Hennessey, Dann, Meyer, Schlupp, Benteke, McCarthy, Kelly</p>
      <p>Liverpool XI: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum; Oxlaide-Chamberlain, Firmino, Mane</p>
      <p>Subs: Adrian, Milner, Keita, Salah, Gomez, Lallana, Origi.</p>
