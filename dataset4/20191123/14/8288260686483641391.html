      <p>Birmingham City boss Pep Clotet <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/huddersfield-town-v-birmingham-city-17305260">made three changes to his starting 11</a> for the game away to Huddersfield Town.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues</a> return to Championship action after a two-week international break with a game against Danny Cowley’s Terriers.</p>
      <p>Lee Camp’s error against Fulham sees him replaced by Connal Trueman, who has come through the  Academy, with Jacques Maghoma and Jeremie Bela coming in for Fran Villalba and Kerim Mrabti.</p>
      <p>Here’s how the Birmingham fans reacted to the shake-up...</p>

      <p><b>@bencwilliams_:</b> Anyone that asks if @pepclotet listens to the fans, today you have your answer. Bold decision dropping Camp but the right one. Up the blues.</p>
      <p><b>@JamesJenkinson_:</b> I mean. Mags in offers more defensively. Bela with the pace on the break. Both make sense. Very surprised he’s dropped Camp. It’s not with justification but big chance for Trueman.</p>
      <p><b>@RichardTonry:</b> So big call by pep dropping camp just wondering who the fans will blame if we lose today pep Truman or someone else! Let's hope it dont come to that and we get the 3 points come on you blue boys.</p>
      <p><b>@JoshhButler15:</b> Trueman in goal is a surprise tbf.</p>
      <p><b>@BBABirmingham:</b> I was hoping camp would be dropped but now they’ve actually done it I’m terrified.</p>
      <p><b>@Jak_Collier:</b> Well done Pep to be fair, brave decision needed to happen to give another keeper a go!</p>
      <p><b>@beaublue07:</b> Good Luck to Trueman. Thrown in when he is needed, so we wish you every bit of luck possible this afternoon.</p>
      <p><b>@KieranBcfc89:</b> Can the fans please not get on Trueman's back If we concede some soft goals? Will ruin the kid.</p>
      <p><b>@Jack_line34:</b> That’s very brave.</p>
      <p><b>@nathancarty112:</b> Come on Trueman show us what you got.</p>
      <p><b>BLUES (4-4-2):</b> Trueman; Colin, Roberts, Clarke-Salter, Pedersen; Crowley, Sunjic, Bellingham, Maghoma; Bela, Jutkiewicz. Subs: Camp, Harding, Montero, Davis, Villalba, McEachran, Gimenez</p>
