      <p>In order to make multiple accounts safe and secure, macOS compartmentalizes your data and settings, linking them to <i>your</i> user ID. That way, you can keep a shared Mac in the living room or somewhere else accessible to the whole family. Everyone can use it, but each person's data is siloed from other members of the family.</p>
      <p>Setting up multiple users on a Mac is just as applicable to work situations where more than one employee has to use the same Mac. Individual user accounts provide the best protection for everyone: They ensure that no one accidentally deletes your data or sees information they're not supposed to see.</p>
      <p>Note: The <b>Managed with Parental Controls</b> account option is the best for kids, giving parents a lot of control over how their children can access the Internet and use their Mac. To understand more how parental controls work on the Mac, read the link below!</p>
