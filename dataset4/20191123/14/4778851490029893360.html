      <p>A blue Vauxhall Zafira crashed into a house, which resulted in both being set on fire.</p>
      <p>Emergency services attended and the occupants of the car - three men aged 22, 32 and 36 - and a 61-year-old woman who was in the house were safely removed by police.</p>
      <p>The driver and two passengers were taken to Western Isles Hospital for treatment to serious injuries.</p>
      <p>A 32-year-old man was arrested in connection with road traffic offences.</p>
      <p>The road is down to single-lane traffic while police investigate.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Donald Sinclair, of Stornoway's Church Street station, said: "Our inquiries into the circumstances of the crash are ongoing and I am appealing for anyone who saw the crash or who saw a blue Vauxhall Zafira being driven on the A857 before 1.30am to come forward.</p>
      <p>"I'm particularly keen to speak to anyone who may have dashcam footage which could help with our inquiries."</p>
