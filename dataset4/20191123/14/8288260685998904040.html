      <p>“The reason I can do what I do is because of the support around me. All of the ladies in Breast Friends have such a very special bond, because everyone is coming from the same direction and we’re all breast cancer survivors. I’m not sorry for the way my life went, I have got so much out of it since. Being touched by cancer changes your whole perspective and that’s not always a bad thing.</p>
      <p>“I can’t believe I am the winner of this award! It was a very emotional evening for me and a really lovely memory.”</p>
      <p>Runners-up were Roger Bunting, a volunteer at Our Place and Mary Sutton, a volunteer receptionist at Relate Sutton Coldfield.</p>
      <p>The Community Group of the Year winner was CPR Counts, set up by Malcolm Robinson, whose life was saved by a passing off-duty nurse, after he suffered a cardiac arrest. The small and dedicated team has given free two-hour life-saving training to over 1,000 residents in Sutton Coldfield.</p>
      <p>Malcolm, who collected the award on behalf of CPR Counts, said:  “My life has completely changed since I had my cardiac arrest. Although I've officially retired, CPR Counts is now a full-time job but I feel so lucky to be alive and to be able to give something back to the community.</p>
      <p>“We are feeling highly honoured and proud to receive this award would like to thank all the many people who've helped us along the way to keep our 'show on the road'.</p>
