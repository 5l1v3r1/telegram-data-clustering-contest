      <p>MUMBAI: Mind coaches play a crucial role in sports as they teach players mental game skills to improve their performance and learning.</p>
      <p>And as Angad Bedi is essaying the role of a cricketer in the web show "Inside Edge 2", he chose to get training under a mind coach to understand what sportsmen experience in reality.</p>
      <p>Sharing his experience of his meeting with the mind coach, Angad said: "It was something that I wanted to experience to understand my character Arvind's psyche. He is at a space and place in life which is hard to be tapped for me. I have heard stories from friends but I have never personally been there.</p>
      <p>"Mind coaches are people with whom cricketers are their raw self, volatile and vulnerable so I knew that it was worth studying. Arvind will be seen in a different light this time. There are layers to him which will be explored. He causes quite a stir as well through his actions and all of it impacts it deeply. I am glad I did my homework on the character or it wouldn't have turned out as well as it did. I am happy with how this has shaped up."</p>
      <p>Written and directed by Karan Anshuman, the first season of "Inside Edge" revolved around the Mumbai Mavericks team -- a part of PPL (Powerplay T20 League), which is a fictional Indian Premier League kind of T20 cricket tournament.</p>
      <p>The second season will stream on Amazon Prime from December 6.</p>
