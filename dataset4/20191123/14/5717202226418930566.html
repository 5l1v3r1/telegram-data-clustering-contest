      <p>Felipe Anderson played just 45 minutes in the defeat to Tottenham on Saturday afternoon – and some West Ham fans on Twitter teared into their player for his performance.</p>
      <p>The Hammers were beaten 3-2 at home by Spurs and it means they stay 16th in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Manuel Pellegrini’s side were second-best in the contest against Spurs, albeit they mounted a late comeback to show some spirit and fight.</p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho’s new-look Spurs took a two-goal lead by half-time, as Heung-Min Son and Lucas Moura both got on the scoresheet.</p>
      <p>Harry Kane then wrapped up three points early in the second-half with his goal and it lifted his team up the table to sixth.</p>
      <p>Michail Antonio did score in the 73rd minute with a clever finish, while Angelo Ogbonna netted in stoppage time which turned out to be the last act of the game.</p>

      <p>A selection of West Ham supporters on social media vented their frustration towards Anderson for his individual display.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old once again started in the Hammers XI and was withdrawn at half-time after failing to make very little impact going forward.</p>
      <p>The left-winger has still failed to score a single goal this campaign and the Brazilian looks a long way off the standard he set last year.</p>
      <p>Here are some West Ham fans on Anderson:</p>
