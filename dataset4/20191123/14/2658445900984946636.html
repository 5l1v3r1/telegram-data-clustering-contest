      <p>Landslides and floods caused by torrential rains have killed at least 24 people in Kenya, officials said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>At least 17 people were buried overnight by landslides in West Pokot County, north of the capital Nairobi, county commissioner Apollo Okello told dpa.</p>
      <p>A family of seven people was swept away by floods in another part of the county, Okello said.</p>
      <p>An undisclosed number of people were missing on Saturday, while infrastructure including roads and bridges had been damaged, according to Emmanuel Ameme, a coordinator for the National Government Affirmative Action Fund.</p>
      <p>Heavy rainfall continued on Saturday, with the Kenya Red Cross sending rescue teams into affected areas.</p>
      <p>“The rivers are swelling again, so the damage might even be worse,” Okello told dpa.</p>
