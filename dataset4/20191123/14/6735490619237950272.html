      <p>John Legend was recently crowned <i>People</i>‘s Sexiest Man Alive, and now he’ll be celebrating Christmas as the Sexiest Elf Alive.</p>
      <p>The “All of Me” singer unveiled his new holiday persona on Friday’s edition of “The Tonight Show”, with host Jimmy Fallon — as “Jasper St. Mirth” — introducing a TV commercial for the make-believe album <i>John Legend Presents: Sexiest Elf Alive.</i></p>
      <p>“Do you love Christmas music, but wish it was less cheerful and more, sexy?” Fallon’s St. Mirth asks. “Well then, you’re going to love this new album from the man who brought you <i>A Legendary Christmas </i>and <i>A Legendary Christmas: Deluxe Edition —</i> it’s <i>John Legend Presents: Sexiest Elf Alive</i>. It’s full of all the sexiest, sultriest, nastiest Christmas songs out there.”</p>

      <p>Legend is then shown sitting in front of a piano, wearing a sleeveless elf costumer to sing a super-sexy rendition of “Jingle Bells”, switching up the lyrics to make the song a bit steamier. “Jingle bells, Jingle bells, jingle all the way / Put some tassels on your nips, and let them swing away, hey!” he sings.</p>
      <p>Legend gives similar treatments to such Yuletide classics as “All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth” and “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer”, while Fallon’s character shares some of the additional tracks on the album.</p>
      <p>Among these: “Grandma Got Run Over By a Sexy Reindeer”, “God Rest Ye Merry Sexy-Men” and “I Saw Three Ships Come Sailing In and They Were All Full of Hot Sexy Single Brazilian Models”.</p>

      <p><i>People</i> named Legend as this year’s honouree, taking on the mantel held by last year’s Sexiest Man Alive Idris Elba.</p>
      <p>“I was excited, but I was a little scared at the same time because it’s a lot of pressure,” Legend jokingly told <a href="https://people.com/music/john-legend-sexiest-man-alive-2019-reveal/"><i>People</i></a> when he accepted the honour. “Everyone’s going to be picking me apart to see if I’m sexy enough to hold this title. I’m [also] following Idris Elba, which is not fair and is not nice to me!”</p>
