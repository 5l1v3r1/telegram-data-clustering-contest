        <b>Jose Mourinho's Tottenham reign got off to a winning start as Spurs beat West Ham 3-2 at the London Stadium.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The London Derby was very one-sided in the first-half as Spurs dominated possession and went 2-0 up through goals from Son Heung-min and Lucas Moura.</p>
      <p>Son fired home after a Dele Alli pass to make it 1-0 in the 36th minute.</p>
      <p>It was well-deserved and it go better for Mourinho just before the break as Moura doubled the lead.</p>
      <p>This time Son turned providers as the Brazilian converted his cross.</p>
      <p>The second-half started in the same vein and Harry Kane got in on the act in the 49th minute.</p>

      <p>The captain headed in Serge Aurier's cross to kill off the game, or so Spurs thought.</p>
      <p>A lovely finish from Michail Antonio gave the hosts a bit of hope with 20 minutes left on the clock.</p>
      <p>Angelo Ogbonna scored in the 96th minute but it was too late to do anything except take some of the gloss off Spurs' win.</p>
      <p>Mourinho didn't look as happy with his team's performance after that but it's still job done and a first away victory since January.</p>
