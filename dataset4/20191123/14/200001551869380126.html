      <h1>Manager is ‘number one goal’ for Manchester United – Big claims from Marca editor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:35:03+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/sean-lunt/" target="_blank">Sean Lunt</a></address>
      <p>With Tottenham now firmly in the rear-view mirror, Mauricio Pochettino will be looking to the future and where he ends up next.</p>
      <p>Bayern Munich is seemingly the most likely option given the German champions are without a permanent boss following the sacking of Niko Kovac.</p>
      <p>However, they are not likely to be the only interested party. Real Madrid is a potential destination, while Manchester United have also been long-time admirers of the Portuguese boss.</p>
      <p>And it seems that admiration has not gone away, despite the fact United are seemingly committed to Ole Gunnar Solskjær long-term.</p>
      <p>Covering Pochettino’s situation today, <a href="http://marca.com/">Marca</a> editor Jose Felix Diaz has revealed that Pochettino is the <i>‘number one goal’</i> for Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Diaz says Pochettino has become <i>‘one of the most coveted pieces in the coach market’</i> which is no surprise given the success he enjoyed for the majority of his time at Spurs.</p>
      <p>He then points to Bild’s claims that Bayern Munich are keen on the Argentine before stating that Marca, his newspaper, can <i>‘assure’</i> it’s readers that it’s Manchester United who are actually at the front of the queue.</p>
      <p>Diaz does not divulge how he knows this, but, it’s a bold statement from the editor of one of Spain’s major newspapers and not one he would make without good cause.</p>

      <p>There’s no mention when United may make their move or any suggestion that they will, just that Pochettino is the man they want if a managerial change is needed.</p>
      <p>That will rest on Solskjær’s performances, and the Manchester United boss must surely be feeling the pressure with Pochettino free.</p>
