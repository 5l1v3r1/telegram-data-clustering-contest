      <p>A huge transaction from a single, anonymous Bitcoin whale is sending waves through the cryptoverse.</p>

      <p>The fee for the transaction cost just 40 cents.</p>
      <p>Aside from that seismic transfer, crypto whales have been relatively quiet as Bitcoin drags the overall crypto market lower.</p>
      <p>Another Bitcoin transaction of note in the last day was a <a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1197806692777500672">movement</a> of 12,000 BTC worth about $89 million from the Japanese Bitcoin wallet and exchange service Coincheck to an unknown wallet.</p>
