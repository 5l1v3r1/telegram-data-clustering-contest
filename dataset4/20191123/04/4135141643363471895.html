      <p>No. 16 Wisconsin gave up a pair of early goals and never recovered in a 4-1 loss to Minnesota on Friday night in Minneapolis.</p>
      <p>The Gophers scored back-to-back goals in the early minutes of the first period to jump out to a 2-0 lead.</p>
      <p>Sean Dhooghe got the Badgers on the board midway through the second period after a nice feed from Cole Caufield to make it a 2-1 game, but the Gophers responded with a pair of goals in the third to seal the win.</p>
      <p>Daniel Lebedeff got the start in goal, making 25 saves.</p>
      <p>The two teams meet for the border battle series finale on Saturday at 7 p.m. on FOX Sports Wisconsin.</p>
