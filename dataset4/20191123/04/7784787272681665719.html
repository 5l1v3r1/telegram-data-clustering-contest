      <h3>When it comes to the draft, not many know it better than AFL national talent ambassador Kevin ‘Shifter’ Sheehan.</h3>
      <p>This time next week, Matt Rowell and Noah Anderson are expected to have started life on the Gold Coast as a Sun. And more than 100 other draftees will have found new clubs.</p>
      <p>But before the 2019 National Draft starts on Wednesday night, Sheehan has named his list of the best players chosen at each pick in the top 40.</p>

      <p>The ‘Super Draft’ in 2001 is well represented. Hawthorn legend Luke Hodge gets the nod ahead of St Kilda champion Nick Riewoldt, with Chris Judd, Jimmy Bartel, Steve Johnson, Sam Mitchell, Leigh Montagna and Gary Ablett Jnr all included.</p>
      <p>Richmond may have won two of the past three flags, but they are reminded of what they missed inside the first five picks, when they chose Aaron Fiora ahead of Matthew Pavlich in 1999 and Richard Tambling the spot before Lance Franklin in 2004.</p>

      <p>Two of the best key defenders of the past decade were taken in consecutive picks in 2007, with Geelong plucking Harry Taylor out of the WAFL at Pick 17 and Richmond nabbing Alex Rance with the next pick.</p>
      <p>A handful of father-son selections feature on Sheehan’s list. None more famous than dual Brownlow medallist Gary Ablett Jnr.</p>
