      <h1>Chelsea to target €16m-rated CSKA Moscow starlet in January</h1>

        <b>Chelsea are reportedly interested in signing CSKA Moscow forward Fedor Chalov in January provided their transfer ban is lifted.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 21-year-old has been an integral player for the Russian club, netting 35 goals and providing 19 assists in 108 appearances across all competitions. Chalov has been a regular for CSKA Moscow this season, amassing five goals and as many assists in 22 appearances across all competitions.</p>

      </p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11867639/chelsea-interested-in-fedor-chalov-in-january-if-uefa-transfer-ban-is-overturned">Sky Sports</a>, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is an admirer of the Russian international and the club will make a move for him in January if their transfer ban is lifted. An earlier <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/11865941/chelsea-set-for-verdict-on-transfer-ban-appeal-in-december">report</a> from the British TV channel claimed that the Blues will learn next month whether their ban will be lifted or not. Chalov is currently valued at €16 million according to <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.in/fedor-chalov/profil/spieler/287183">Transfermarkt</a>.</p>
      <p>Chelsea’s attack department currently consists of Tammy Abraham, Michy Batshuayi and Olivier Giroud. The addition of Chalov would certainly add more depth but the 21-year-old will find it hard to be a regular starter under Frank Lampard.</p>
