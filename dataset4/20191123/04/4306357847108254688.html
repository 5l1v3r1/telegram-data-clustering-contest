      <h3>Unai Emery has admitted his surprise that Mauricio Pochettino was sacked by Tottenham last week but he is tipping Jose Mourinho to do a good job at the north London club.</h3>
      <p>Spurs opted to sack their Argentine head coach on Tuesday night after a poor start to the season for the Lilywhites left them languishing down in 14th place in the table.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Tottenham have only won three of their opening 12 games in the Premier League this season and they currently find themselves a staggering 11 points adrift of the top four.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has been brought in to help steer Tottenham up the Premier League table as the Portuguese coach aims to reverse Tottenham’s ailing fortunes.</p>
      <p>Spurs will kick off life under their new manager with a trip to West Ham United in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Arsenal manager Emery has now spoken out about Tottenham’s decision to sack Pochettino and replace him with Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview quoted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/arsenal-manager-unai-emery-reacts-jose-mourinho-replacing-mauricio-pochettino-tottenham-11195638/">Metro</a>, Emery said: I think it’s a surprise how it finished with Pochettino.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know exactly why and how it’s going to change their performance. [Jose] is a very good coach, his career is strong with titles and experience and I think also Pochettino working in Tottenham was amazing.”</p>
      <p>Asked whether he was surprised by Pochettino’s sacking, Emery said: “Yes, for me it was a surprise.</p>
      <p>“Maybe the last matches they didn’t achieve a good result but in the last year with Pochettino was perfect.</p>
      <p>“They decided to change and I don’t know the reason but we have our way and they have their way. We want to keep that distance [ahead of them in the Premier League table].”</p>
      <p>Arsenal will return to Premier League action on Saturday afternoon when they take on Southampton at The Emirates.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are currently sixth in the Premier League table and eight points adrift of the top four after 12 games of the new campaign.</p>
