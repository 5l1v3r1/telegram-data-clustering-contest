      <p>The Democratic Alliance Johannesburg mayoral candidate, Funzela Ngobeni, is confident of winning the mayoral vote to replace Herman Mashaba on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“Our successes speak for themselves. Joburg has asked for change and we have been delivering this since we took over from the ANC in 2016,” Ngobeni said.</p>
      <p>He acknowledged that the task of running the city would not be easy but he was ready for it.</p>
      <p>The city’s plans, strategies and achievements over the past three years have been the combined efforts of a collective – by different executive members in different portfolios.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Saturday Citizen, Ngobeni wasn’t bothered by the fact that he would be filling the big shoes of Herman Mashaba, who had massive political clout.</p>
      <p>He believed that the position of Member of the Mayoral Committee: Finance wasn’t just technical nor was he an “technocrat but it was a highly political task”.</p>
      <p>Although he would adopt his own style of work different to Mashaba’s, he would, like Mashaba work with the opposition.</p>
      <p>If needs be, he would strive to work with the ANC, the main opposition party that had been a thorn in the side of Mashaba.</p>
      <p>“I will strive to work with them – as I do with all other parties to ensure that we prioritise service delivery,” he said.</p>
      <p>Ngobeni, 44, has promised to continue with the plans as laid out in the Integrated Development Planning and deliver to the people.</p>
      <p>“Visible service delivery remains our priority,” he said.</p>
