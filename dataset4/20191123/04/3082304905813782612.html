        <b>Kuwait had to come back from behind to defeat Pakistan in the opening match of their 2020 AFC U19 Championship Qualifiers at the Al Seeb Stadium in Seeb, Oman.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Matches in 10 out of the 11 groups have been completed and <a href="https://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/asian-football/afc-u19-championship/1197497/2020-afc-u19-championship-qualifiers-iran-win-qatar-draw-as-final-tournament-line-up-begins-to-take-shape/">14 out of the 16 qualification slots for next year’s continental championship in Uzbekistan have already been filled.</a></p>
      <p>However, Group A featuring Oman, Palestine, Iraq, Kuwait and Pakistan was postponed after Iraq, who were originally to host the matches from the first week of November, saw anti-government protests forcing the competition to move out to Oman.</p>

      <p>Pakistan had taken the lead against Kuwait through Muhammad Waheed in the 27th minute, but Kuwait were quick in their reply as Salman Al-Bous equalised in the very next minute before Abdulrahman Karam struck the winner in the 57th minute.</p>
      <p>In the other game of the group, hosts Oman were beaten 1-0 by Palestine as Anas Baniowda scored the only goal of the game in the 19th minute.</p>
      <p>10 group winners — Qatar, Tajikistan, IR Iran, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Australia, Korea Republic and Japan — and four best runners-up — Indonesia, Laos, Vietnam, Uzbekistan and Yemen — have already qualified for the 2020 AFC U19 Championship.</p>
      <p>The two remaining slots in the tournament proper will go to the winner of Group A and the runners-up in Group A if they can better Cambodia’s tally of six points and goal difference of +3.</p>
