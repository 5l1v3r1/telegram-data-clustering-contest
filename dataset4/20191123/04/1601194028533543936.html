      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE </a>Hall of Famer <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/stone-cold-steve-austin">Stone Cold Steve Austin</a> recently <a href="https://www.si.com/wrestling/2019/11/20/wwe-wrestling-news-steve-austin-interview-show-undertaker">sat down</a> with Sports Illustrated to promote the premiere of "Broken Skull Sessions", featuring WWE legend The Undertaker. Austin opened up on AEW and WWE competing against each other and stated that both promotions are in competition despite not admitting to the same.</p>
      <p>AEW's arrival on the Pro Wrestling scene was met with excitement on the fans' end, as many had been clamoring for the same ever since WCW folded, back in 2001. AEW presented its first show, "Double Or Nothing" in May, and hasn't looked back since.</p>
      <p>The company runs its own weekly show named AEW Dynamite, which goes head to head with WWE's NXT. This week was the first time since Dynamite's debut that NXT managed to trump the former in the ratings.</p>

      <p>Austin talked about AEW and WWE refraining from stating that both are in competition, and explained why there is quite a battle between the two.</p>
      <blockquote>Without competition, who knows what would have happened in my careerâ€”who knows what will come out of Wednesday nights, but I believe in competition. I know AEW is doing their thing and they say they're not competition, and WWE might say it's not competition, but if it's on across from each other, it's competition.</blockquote>
