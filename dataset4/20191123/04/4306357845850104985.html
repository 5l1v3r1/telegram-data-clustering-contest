      <h3>Charlie Nicholas is backing Liverpool FC to “edge” to a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace in their Premier League clash in London on Saturday afternoon.</h3>
      <p>The Reds head into the game looking to continue their brilliant start to the new season, with Jurgen Klopp’s men currently eight points clear at the top of the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC have won 11 of their 12 games in the Premier League this season and they were 3-1 winners over Manchester City at Anfield last time out to underline their status as title favourites.</p>
      <p>The Merseyside outfit will be looking to pull a further three points clear of Manchester City with a victory at Selhurst Park on Saturday, with the Citizens in action later in the day when they take on Chelsea FC at The Etihad.</p>
      <p>Former Arsenal star Nicholas is expecting a close game between the two sides but he is tipping Jurgen Klopp’s men to come out on top.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12090/11866441/charlie-nicholas-premier-league-predictions">Sky Sports</a>, Nicholas said: “We keep tipping Liverpool to slip up and they aren’t doing it, despite not being at the top of their game and showing they are an efficient machine. Crystal Palace have been awkward for Liverpool in past.</p>
      <p>“Their players have been travelling a lot and there is no rest for Liverpool. Virgil van Dijk should be back after missing the last Netherlands game for personal reasons and Jurgen Klopp needs to get by with same three because there is no reason to change it up.</p>
      <p>“Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is fighting fit and looking as though he deserves a starting berth and with Andy Robertson not playing for Scotland, he should be fit too.</p>
      <p>“Dare I say, Christian Benteke may be a threat to his old team? He needs goals badly and it is something to consider, but I think Liverpool will edge it.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC will return to Champions League action on Wednesday night when they host Napoli at Anfield.</p>
      <p>They will then prepare for their home clash against Brighton and Hove Albion in the Premier League at Anfield next Saturday afternoon.</p>
