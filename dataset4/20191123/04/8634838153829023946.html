      <h1>Waititu's Deputy Boldly Threatens Him in Angry Rant</h1>

        <b>Kiambu Governor Ferdinand <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46627-waititu-goes-after-his-deputy-new-comeback-move">Waititu's war with his deputy </a>James Nyoro escalated as Nyoro made a bold declaration in their power struggle.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nyoro assumed office temporarily after Waititu was barred by the court due to an ongoing court case on fraud.</p>
      <p>On Friday, November 22, Nyoro while speaking at an event in Kiambu threatened to quit if Waititu was allowed back into office.</p>

      <p>"If the court allows you to return into office, we shall leave the office for you as we cannot share the same office with you.</p>
      <p>"When you come in we will go if you return. That is if you return! But as long as I am here, my team will work without disruption," Nyoro warned. </p>
      <p>He went on to warn individuals from rallying him to work with Waititu to rebuild Kiambu, stating that he could do it on his own.</p>
      <p>"Let no one urge me to come back on the perspective that Kiambu is burning. If it is burning, then let us extinguish the fire, not you (Waititu)," Nyoro lashed out.</p>
      <p>The seemingly angry Nyoro, however, called upon Kiambu residents to unite and work together. He then made a thinly veiled attack at Waititu's Kiambu leadership, alleging that he was not one of their own. </p>
      <p>"I urge Kiambu residents to desist from politicking and focus on development. I also laud the Kiambu County Assembly on how we have managed to work together and we have seen that the future is bright.</p>
      <p>"It's now time for visitors to depart among us and let the people who belong here focus on developing the region," Nyoro proclaimed. </p>
      <p>Embattled Kiambu Governor <b>Ferdinand Waititu</b> on Wednesday, November 20, ran to court with a fresh application against his deputy James Nyoro.</p>
      <p>In an application of urgency, Waititu sought the stay of execution of a High Court order barring him from accessing his office.</p>
      <p>Waititu, his wife and a number of officials from the county stand accused of embezzling public funds to the tune of Ksh588 million. The magistrate had on July 30, granted him <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/42287-governor-waititu-released-3-conditions">bail with strict terms not</a> to access his office. </p>
