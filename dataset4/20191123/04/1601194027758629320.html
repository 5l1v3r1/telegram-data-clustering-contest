      <p>This week's <a href="http://sportskeeda.com/live/wwe-smackdown-results-live-updates-highlights-commentary-online-from-friday-night-smackdown-after-crown-jewel-2019-1st-november-2019">SmackDown</a> was the go-home show for <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">Survivor Series</a>, which will take place this Sunday. As expected, RAW and NXT invaded the Blue brand on Friday night. WWE reserved the best invasion for the last segment of the show as RAW, led by Seth Rollins, invaded the show.</p>
      <p>Seth Rollins led the charge, appearing through the crowd, a-la The Shield-like, and went on to attack former Shield brother Roman Reigns.</p>
      <p>All hell broke loose as RAW and SmackDown Superstars brawled on the show. But, NXT made the biggest impression on the show to close out SmackDown. NXT, led by Triple H, Shawn Michaels, and Road Dogg, invaded SmackDown on a jeep, much like what DX did all those years ago.</p>
      <p>The NXT Superstars then brawled with Superstars of both brands.</p>
      <p>After SmackDown went off the air, DX's three members attacked a former NXT and current SmackDown Superstar - Baron Corbin.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/dx-reunites-after-wwe-smackdown-goes-off-the-air-662556">WrestlingInc</a>, DX tried to persuade Corbin to join them and when the 2019 King of the Ring winner accepted, they turned on him. Road Dogg landed a punch, followed by a Shawn Michaels Sweet Chin Music, while Triple H added the finishing touches with a Pedigree!</p>
