      <p>A mother has issued an emotional appeal to catch her son’s killer on the first anniversary of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/knife-crime">his death</a>.</p>
      <p>Jackie Wilson yesterday begged people in Milton, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a>, including gangland figures, to stop protecting Billyjoe Bates’s murderer.</p>
      <p>She said: “I am appealing to anyone who has information about the murder of my son to come forward, even if you think it’s irrelevant.</p>
      <p>“After a year has passed, I still have no answers to why this has happened. How a coward can do this to someone and leave them lying dying is beyond me.</p>
      <p>“I’m devastated and heartbroken.</p>

      <p>Officers believe he may have witnessed a key detail in the crime but stressed they aren’t connecting the shopper with Billyjoe’s death.</p>
      <p>Reports have suggested the killer is a man known to Billyjoe and the knife attack happened after an altercation at a party.</p>
      <p>It was claimed the killer had fled to Spain.</p>
      <p>Crimestoppers, which can be contacted on 0800 555 111, has offere£10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.</p>
