      <p>South African sports fans are notoriously fickle when it comes to the so-called oldies. If we perceive a veteran to be underperforming, we immediately call for a young rookie to take his place. Immediately!</p>
      <p>So, it’s not really surprising that the Lions’ negotiations with Jannie du Plessis have divided opinion.</p>
      <p>The former Springbok tighthead is 37 and returns home from a “cushy” and lucrative four-year stint with big-spending French club Montpellier. What on earth would possess him to come to unfashionable Doornfontein?</p>
      <p>There are many obvious reasons. The Lions are desperately short on depth and proven class at prop, but specifically tighthead.</p>
      <p>Props arguably only mature closer to thirty – a prime recent example is Trevor Nyakane.</p>
      <p>One doesn’t even have to mention all of Du Plessis’s experience, which includes 70 Tests.</p>
      <p>What his potential move doesn’t reveal is that he could be a crucial part in a broader masterplan rather than a messiah of sorts.</p>
      <p>However, this assumes that the Lions complete another signing in Stormers tighthead Carlu Sadie.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old was outstanding on loan in this year’s edition of Super Rugby and is currently stuck behind Springboks Frans Malherbe and Wilco Louw. Having him languishing in a system where he won’t get regular game-time does no-one any favours.</p>
      <p>For the good of SA rugby and Sadie, he needs to be signed on the ticket of being considered a first-choice player. But it also won’t help him much being the only top-class No 3 at Ellis Park. He needs competition to keep him at his sharpest.</p>
      <p>That’s what Du Plessis provides … and if Sadie does experience a dip, a proven veteran can fill the void.</p>
