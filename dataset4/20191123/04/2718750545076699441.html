      <h1>Apple TV+ Asks M. Night Shyamalan’s <i>Servant</i> Back for a Second Season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T04:57:49+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 04:57</time> by <a rel="author">Halle Kiefer</a></address>
      <p>When <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/servant-trailer-m-night-shyamalan-trailer-apple-tv.html">the trailer for your horror series</a> <i>starts </i>with a mother driven to the brink by grief parenting an inanimate plastic doll, chances are you’re going to need more than ten episodes to unpack everything. On Friday, Apple TV+ announced that their upcoming horror show <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/servant/"><i>Servant</i></a>, written by <i>Hotel Babylon</i> creator Tony Basgallop, has been picked up for a second season ahead of its series premiere. Executive producer <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/m-night-shyamalan/">M. Night Shyamalan</a> stopped by <i>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i> tonight to announced the order, but in a true M. Night Shyamalan twist, Apple already told us. Still! Extremely spooky.</p>
      <p>If you haven’t seen <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/11/servant-trailer-m-night-shyamalan-trailer-apple-tv.html">the series’ unnerving trailer</a> yet, <i>Servant</i> enters the life of a couple who, having suffered the loss of their child, hires a nanny willing to play along with the wife’s conviction that their doll is her living son. Unfortunately, that nanny also ushers all sorts of perturbing developments into their home: a wooden doll, fire, Rupert Grint, you name it. The show’s first season premieres next week on November 28, so hopefully <i>Servant </i>Season two will return in time for another big family holiday. Fourth of July, maybe?</p>
