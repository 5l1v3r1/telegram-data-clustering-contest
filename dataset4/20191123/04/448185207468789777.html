      <p>Will the present BJP-led NDA government at the Centre — like its predecessors — betray the Koch Rajbanshis and the other five communities (Ahom, Moran, Motok, Chutia and the Tea Tribes) fighting for ages for ST status? The movement of the six communities is the largest and the longest of the ethnic movements seeking constitutional safeguards and opportunities for social empowerment. Unfortunately, every political party has just been making promises to fulfil their demands in order to derive electoral benefit from the communities. On January 7, 2019, the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes had recommended and approved the proposal to grant ST status to the six communities and the same was concurred by the Registrar General of India (RGI). Accordingly, on January 9, the government placed the matter in Lok Sabha in the form of a bill through the then Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, which was passed by the House. The bill was later placed in Rajya Sabha by Union Tribal Affairs Minister Jual Oram, but mysteriously there was no discussion nor was it listed as passed.</p>
      <p>At the instance of the then Home Minister, a committee was formed in Assam under Dr. Himanta Biswa Sharma with his other cabinet colleagues Chandan Brahma and Naba Kumar Doley to work out the modalities of granting ST status to the communities. Formal meetings between the community members and the Group of Ministers (GoM) were also held in the first week of February this year where the possible modalities were suggested, which were thereafter broadly accepted by the community leaders in order to allay misplaced apprehensions in the existing tribal communities. However, the members of the six communities are in the dark as to their future. Technically, only one step is pending to declare the six communities as Scheduled Tribes (STs), that is, to have the bill passed in Rajya Sabha. But there seems to be no interest or sincerity on the part of the governments both in the State and at the Centre to keep the promise and ensure due constitutional safeguards and developments of the six communities. It is thus quite likely that the six communities might well be subjected to another round of political betrayal, which will surely erode the credibility of the present political dispensation.</p>
