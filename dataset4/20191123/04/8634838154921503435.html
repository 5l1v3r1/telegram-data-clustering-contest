        <b>Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko came out on Friday, November 22 and hit back at county's senator Johnson Sakaja with damning allegations after the later called him out for mismanaging the county.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sonko took to Facebook to accuse the senator of accepting a bribe of Ksh 250,000 from one of the land grabbers through the ousted county assembly majority leader Abdi Guyo to tarnish his name.</p>
      <p>"Our beloved Nairobi MPs received Ksh250,000 from the landgrabber through the ousted leader of impunity and corruption who is also Matopeni MCA," Sonko alleged.</p>

      <p>The governor further claimed George Aladwa met with Guyo at his Town House Office where he was handed the press statement together with Ksh5 Million to share with the MPs.</p>
      <p>"I can confirm to you the statement read by Senator Johnson Sakaja was a copy-paste of what Abdi Guyo had alleged at Radio Citizen and KTN and was not written by Sakaja but was delivered by Guyo from Alladwa," he added.</p>
      <p>He then alleged that Sakaja had changed tunes on his support for the statement that was sought in the senate by Machakos Senator Boniface Mutinda Kabaka on the land grabbing of the South C public children's playground.</p>
      <p>"The question to ask is, what changed between Thursday 14th November 2019 and Thursday 21st November 2019 for Sakaja to change his tune. Well, what changed is that Sakaja received Ksh1.5 Million from the Ksh5 Million collected by Aladwa from Guyo, Aladwa kept Ksh1.5 Million for himself," the governor alleged.</p>
      <p>Sonko also alleged that Sakaja short-changed the MPs in the deal by claiming that Guyo had given them Ksh2 million thus they had to share Ksh250,000 each.</p>
      <p>"Matopeni MCA and the EACC head of investigations are partners in the South C Mall being built on grabbed public land by Issack Abdullahi Ibrahim who bankrolled the MPs Press Conference,</p>
      <p>"Needless to say, reliable sources have intimated that the Matopeni Mca received Ksh10 Million from the Land Grabber but only delivered Ksh5 Million and kept the rest for himself just like Sakaja and Aladwa kept Ksh3 Million between the two of them," claimed the Governor.</p>
