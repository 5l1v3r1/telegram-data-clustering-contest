      <p>They’ve been a national institution for more than 150 years... and now scientists have come up with the recipe for the perfect <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/food">chip</a>.</p>
      <p>They should be 2.8 inches long, quar­ter of an inch thick, cut from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/food">Maris Piper spuds</a>, crispy outside and fluffy within.</p>
      <p>And for a heavenly taste they should be sprinkled with salt – no pepper – and served with ketchup.</p>
      <p>Research by the Food Advisory Board reveals the classic <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/food">straight-cut chip</a> rules supreme over the curly and the crimped.</p>
      <p>Its survey of 2000 people found vin­­egar was the nation’s second-favourite condiment with mayonnaise third.</p>
      <p>One in five liked curry sauce on their chips. And while northerners showed a liking for gravy, southerners preferred cheese.</p>
      <p>Four in 10 said chips were their fav­­ourite food and a quarter would eat them every day if they could.</p>
      <p>FAB expert Prof Robert Pickard said they should be cooked skin-on to take advantage of the fibre and potassium.</p>
      <p>He added: “Thick-cut chips are healthier as they absorb less cooking fat than thin ones.”</p>
      <p>In Lancashire, John Lees is celebrated as the first person to sell chips served with fried fish. He began his business in a wooden hut in Mossley market in 1863.</p>
      <p>By the 1920s, there were 35,000 shops and 10,500 are still open today selling almost 300million portions of fish and chips a year.</p>
