      <p>Since October 9, Turkey has been cracking down on dissent over the Syria operation, with several arrests.<br/>The Interior Minister, Suleyman Soylu earlier said that about 500 social media accounts had been investigated for insulting the operation and that 121 people have been arrested. In a separate development, the authorities have also arrested at least 53 people over suspected links to the Fetullah Terrorist Organization (FETO), the group behind the 2016 defeated coup attempt.</p>
      <p>The suspects were nabbed after prosecutors in the capital Ankara issued warrants for 92 former Air Force staff dismissed after the defeated coup. The dismissed officers, according to a statement by the top prosecutor’s office, are being probed for communicating via payphones with FETO members.</p>
