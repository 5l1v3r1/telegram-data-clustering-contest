      <p>Shortly after 4pm, the agency said the fire was out, but firefighters from ACT Fire and Rescue, the ACT Rural Fire Service and ACT Parks and Conservation Service would remain at the scene to monitor the area.</p>
      <p>The fire did not place properties under threat.</p>
      <p>"People in the area may be affected by smoke, which could reduce visibility and air quality," the agency said in a statement.</p>
      <p>An agency spokeswoman said the cause of the fire was yet to be determined.</p>
