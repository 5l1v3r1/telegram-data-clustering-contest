      <p>The Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has said his administration will not relent in transforming the state into a hub for industries, which will improve the economic fortunes of residents.</p>
      <p>The governor, who was represented by Head, Edo State Investment Promotion Office, Mr Kelvin Uwaibi, said this while delivering a paper at the Equipment Leasing Association of Nigeria’s 17th National Lease Conference, themed ‘Promoting leasing for inclusive growth’.</p>
      <p>He said the state government would continue to work to improve the ease of doing business, with policies aimed at creating a conducive and favourable business environment for foreign and local investors.</p>
      <p>Obaseki said, “In the last three years, Edo State has created an enabling environment to attract investors.</p>
      <p>“The state is Nigeria’s best-kept secret with an all-year-round climate for cultivation of crops, among other endowments.”</p>
      <p>He added that Edo State was open for investors and businesses and would continue to improve the ease of doing business.</p>
