      <p>The Group Head, Retail Operations, Access Bank Plc, Mr Abraham Aziegbe, has said Nigeria’s economy will benefit from the border closure.</p>
      <p>Aziegbe said this on Friday during the inauguration of a new branch of Access Bank at Apomu, in the Isokan Local Government Area of Osun State.</p>
      <p>He said the effect of the closure might not be felt now, adding that the policy would be helpful to Nigeria in the long run.</p>
      <p>He said, “The policy, at the long run, would stimulate local productivity by regulating influx of goods coming into the country. The unregulated importation has turned Nigeria into dumping ground of foreign goods.</p>
      <p>“For those who make policies, there are several factors that always inform their decision. Obviously, the effect of border closure will be felt at the long run.”</p>
      <p>He stated that over 40 million Nigerians did not have bank accounts, saying this had in a way affected the economic development of the nation over the years.</p>
