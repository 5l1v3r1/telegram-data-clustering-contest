      <p>Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product grew by 2.28 per cent (year-on-year), in real terms, in the third quarter of 2019, compared to the third quarter of 2018, which recorded a growth of 1.81 per cent.</p>
      <p>The National Bureau of Statistics disclosed in Nigeria’s GDP 2019 third quarter report on Friday that the real GDP growth rate observed in the third quarter indicated an increase of 0.47 per cent points.</p>
      <p>Relative to the second quarter of 2019, which recorded a growth rate of 2.12 per cent, Q3 2019 represented an increase of 0.17 per cent points.</p>
      <p>On a quarter-on-quarter basis, however, real GDP grew by 9.23 per cent.</p>
      <p>The growth rate in Q3 2019 represented the second highest quarterly rate recorded since 2016.</p>
      <p>In the quarter under review, aggregate GDP stood at N37.8tn in nominal terms.</p>
      <p>This performance was higher compared to the aggregate of N33.36tn recorded in the third quarter of 2018, representing a year-on-year nominal growth rate of 13.30 per cent.</p>
      <p>The growth rate was, however, lower relative to rates recorded in the third quarter of 2018 by –0.28 per cent points and the rates recorded in the preceding quarter by –0.71 per cent points.</p>
      <p>A former President, Association of National Accountants of Nigeria, Dr Samuel Nzekwe, said the agriculture sector could have been the driver of the growth.</p>
      <p>He said since the closure of Nigeria’s border, most goods were not coming in, and activities in the agriculture sector rose.</p>
      <p>Nzekwe said, “The other growth areas may be construction industry because a lot of construction is going on now.</p>
      <p>“In the manufacturing sector, however, I don’t think I have seen any reasonable growth in that area because of infrastructure problem – no light and without light, you cannot do much.</p>
      <p>“In real terms, we don’t see the growth or the impact of the GDP. Unemployment is still there; the industries are not working. Even in the agriculture sector, insecurity is not allowing enough activities because of kidnapping and other challenges.”</p>
      <p>The Director-General, Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria, Mr Richard Borokini, said the growth in the third quarter in 2018 and 2019 period could be attributed to oil price and exchange rate, which had been stable.</p>
      <p>This could have had a positive effect on the production of the manufacturing sector, he said.</p>
