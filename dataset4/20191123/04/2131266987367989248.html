      <p>In the BBC's latest complaints round-up, they said 189 people had got in touch to say it was "offensive to feature two men dancing as a pair".</p>
      <p>They said <i>Strictly</i> is an inclusive show and they were "proud" to have the dance between Di Prima and Radebe.</p>
      <p>"They are dancers first and foremost, and their sex had no bearing on their routine," the BBC said in a statement.</p>
      <p>After the dance, Di Prima tweeted "representation always matters" and it was an "unforgettable moment".</p>

      <p>Former <i>Strictly</i> winner Joe McFadden congratulated the show for the move and said "the world didn't end" after the two men danced together.</p>
      <p>Radebe, who is gay, <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/film/2019112180937/strictly-same-sex-dance-complaints/">told Hello! Magazine</a> it was the first time in his life he felt accepted for who he was.</p>
      <p>"To be able to dance with a friend I respect and adore is joyous. There's bromance galore between us, but there were no male and female roles, just free movement. It was beautiful, classy and elegant," he said.</p>
      <p>The show, currently in its 17th series, has never featured a same-sex pairing between a celebrity and a professional dancer.</p>
