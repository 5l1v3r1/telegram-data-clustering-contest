      <p><a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/344714-microsoft-surface-duo-android/">Microsoft</a> announced the Surface Earbuds, and we were all pretty excited for a solid AirPods/Galaxy Buds competitor for the holiday. But it looks like that announcement might’ve come a little early, since the company has had to delay its new headphones until sometime next year.</p>
      <p>According to Microsoft’s CPO, Panos Pay, “Product-making is about the relentless pursuit to get all the details right, which takes time…sometimes more than we planned on. To ensure we deliver the best possible experience for you, our fans &amp; customers, Surface Earbuds will now launch worldwide in Spring 2020.”</p>
      <p>That’s a pretty standard reason, too. Sometimes products just get away from you and you miss deadlines. These earbuds are pretty ambitious, offering 8 hours of battery life and instant translation, and a sleek Windows-ish design. Bad planning on Microsoft’s part, but at least it’s not a huge delay.</p>
      <p>The delay might cause some butting heads between the Surface Earbuds and <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345295-google-pixel-buds-truly-wireless/">new Pixel Buds</a>, though.</p>
