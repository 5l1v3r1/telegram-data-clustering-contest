      <p>In case you were wondering what the <a href="http://www.talkandroid.com/tag/galaxy-s11">Galaxy S11</a> might look like before its official unveiling, a render from @OnLeaks and 91Mobiles has surfaced showcasing all of the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346256-galaxy-s11-galaxy-buds-2-colors/">rumored design changes</a> to Samsung’s next flagship.</p>
      <p>Some of the changes are expected, but there are a few curveballs here, too.</p>
      <h3>New hole punch, weird cameras</h3>
      <p>The Galaxy S11 concept has a hole punch in the front display that’s moved to the center of the screen, which is very similar to the Galaxy Note 10. Honestly this decision probably shouldn’t surprise anyone, since Samsung likes to try and keep their devices at least somewhat in step with each other.</p>
      <p>Also like the Galaxy Note 10 the Galaxy S11 render has the power/Bixby key and volume buttons on the same side, but they’ve shifted to the right side instead of the left. That one feels like change for the sake of change, but hey, do your thing Samsung.</p>
      <p>The back is where things get weird. There’s an absolute unit of a camera module back here with five sensors. There are three cameras, a ToF sensor, and an unknown third sensor, plus an LED flash and autofocus module. There’s a lot going on, but not much symmetry. This one looks… strange. Sure, Apple and Google caught some flak for their stovetop-esque cameras, but Samsung’s going all in here.</p>

      <p>We’re expecting those cameras to blow us away, though, with some other rumors hinting at a <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346596-galaxy-s11-108mp-8k-recording/">108MP sensor and a setup capable of 8K video</a> recording. Screen sizes will range from 6.3-inches for the Galaxy S11e to 6.7 and possibly 6.9 inches for the bigger models of the device, and we’re really <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346598-galaxy-s11-120hz-screen/">hoping for a 120hz display</a> to makes its way to a Samsung flagship sooner rather than later.</p>
