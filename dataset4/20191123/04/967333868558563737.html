        <b>Republican lawmakers continue to dig for 'clues' and 'evidence' in a confusing case - what was relentlessly dubbed Fartgate - against their Democratic colleague, House Intelligence Committee member Eric Swalwell.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Earlier this week, though for a short period of time, Swalwell became politician number one in the US and beyond. His alleged 'audio' symptoms of indigestion <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201911191077351865-most-intelligible-thing-trumps-son-joins-the-fartgate-fray-leaves-netizens-in-stitches/">stayed in the top</a> in social media after a live interview with MSNBC.</p>
      <p>The GOP seemingly is trying to use any opportunity, even a vulgar one, to respond to House Dems amid the ongoing impeachment inquiry against US President Donald Trump.</p>

      <blockquote>House of Representatives Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy posted recently in his Instagram a picture, depicting him standing behind Swalwell.</blockquote>
      <p>McCarthy added a mocking comment, possibly hinting at his knowledge of valuable information that could help Fartgate 'investigators'.</p>
      <p>"The last place you want to stand while giving an interview is behind Rep. Eric Swalwell", McCarthy suggested.</p>
      <blockquote>Donald Trump Jr., the son of the US president, responding to McCarthy's photo, posted in his Instagram stories a redacted picture, showing what was Swalwell accused of in the first place. Trump Jr. has 'warned' McCarthy, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201906281076077943-democratic-candidate-swalwell-blasts-bidens-age/">urging him to avoid</a> "the danger zone".</blockquote>

      <p>Swalwell, meanwhile, has repeatedly <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201906101075763806-dem-candidate-swalwell-compares-democrats-to-avengers-republicans-to-hunger-games/">denied that he was 'behind'</a> the disturbing sound, similar to the audible passing of digestive gasses. Netizens, however, have concluded that so-called fartgate is over, and, after 'in-depth' scrutiny of the now notorious MSNBC interview, allege that the Democratic representative was indeed the one who spoiled the air.</p>
