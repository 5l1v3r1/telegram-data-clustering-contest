      <p>NEW DELHI: <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Uttar-Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a> and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Bihar">Bihar</a>, the top two states in terms of number of beneficiaries, remain the worst performers under <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ayushman-Bharat">Ayushman Bharat</a> while Kerala has outdone both these big states combined in the number of hospital admissions and the amount of claims raised despite joining the national health protection scheme almost six months late.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/UP">UP</a> reported about 230,000 hospital admissions and Bihar about 120,000, Kerala was way ahead with nearly 600,000 hospital admissions under the scheme till date, according to details provided by the Union Health Ministry to Parliament on Friday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Gujarat">Gujarat</a> was the best performer, with a million hospital admissions and claims worth Rs 1,519 crore.</p>
      <p>UP raised claims worth Rs 247 crore and Bihar just Rs 104 crore while Kerala, which joined the scheme in April this year, reported claims worth Rs 366 crore. This was despite the fact that Kerala has about 4.1 million potential beneficiary families, about a third of 11.8 million in the case of UP and 10.9 million in Bihar. Both UP and Bihar joined the scheme when it was launched in September last year.</p>
      <p>Claims worth Rs 7,602 crore were raised across the country under the scheme till November 20, according to the data, and there were nearly 6.2 million admissions country-wide.</p>
      <p>The Centre has been asking both UP and Bihar to improve their performance and awareness among people regarding the scheme, a senior official told ET.</p>
      <p>Smaller states like <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Chhattisgarh">Chhattisgarh</a> and Jharkhand have also individually reported more hospital admissions, about 680,000 and 360,000 respectively, than UP and Bihar put together.</p>
      <p>UP and Bihar also offer a contrasting picture in terms of claims reported from government and private hospitals. While 50,000 claims were submitted from government hospitals in UP, private hospitals submitted more than three times as many claims at about 171,000, the situation was reverse in Bihar, where 82,000 claims were submitted by government hospitals while private hospitals lagged behind with just 29,000 claims.</p>
      <p>A major issue, according to officials, is that UP and Bihar have very few public and private hospitals empanelled under the scheme, among the total 20,905 empanelled hospitals, including 9,905 private hospitals, across the country.</p>
