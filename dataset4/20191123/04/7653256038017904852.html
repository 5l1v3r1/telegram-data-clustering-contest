      <p>The month-long political impasse in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> ended dramatically with <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Devendra-Fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis</a> returning as the state's chief minister again, backed by NCP leader Ajit Pawar, who was sworn-in as the deputy chief minister at Raj Bhavan early Saturday.</p>
      <p>Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, however, clarified that the decision of going with BJP to form the government in Maharashtra was of his nephew (Ajit Pawar).</p>
      <p>"Ajit Pawar's decision to support the BJP to form the Maharashtra Government is his personal decision and not that of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). We place on record that we do not support or endorse this decision of his," Sharad Pawar tweeted.</p>
      <p>The political stunner came at a time when deliberations between Congress, NCP and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Shiv-Sena">Shiv Sena</a> seemingly reached the final stage on Friday. Earlier, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar had claimed that there was a consensus on Sena chief <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Uddhav-Thackeray">Uddhav Thackeray</a> as chief minister of the alliance government.</p>
      <p>Here's what happened:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Friday:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sometime around 11.45 p.m.: Ajit Pawar-BJP Deal finalised.</p>
      <p>11.55 pm.: Fadnavis speaks to party and requests for swearing-in before anyone in Sena-NCP-Congress comes to know and stakes claim.</p>
      <p><b>Saturday:<br/></b><br/>12.30 a.m.: <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Governor">Governor</a> who was to travel out of Mumbai to New Delhi, cancels his travel</p>
      <p>02.10 a.m: Secretary to Governor told to submit revocation order at 5.47 and arrange swearing in at 6.30 a.m.</p>
      <p>02.30 a.m.: Secretary informs he will submit file within two hours and advises 7.30 a.m. for swearing in as arrangements have to be made early on Saturday.</p>
      <p>05.30 a.m.: Both Ajit Pawar and Fadnavis arrive at Raj Bhavan.</p>
      <p>05.47 a.m.: President's Rule revoked.</p>
      <p>07.50 a.m.: Swearing in starts by Governor B.S. Koshiyari.</p>
