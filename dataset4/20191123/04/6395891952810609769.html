      <p><b>BOSTON</b> - Transit Police have arrested a man in connection to a violent assault that happened on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>According to officials, in an unprovoked attack, a man violently assaulted a woman at North Station at around 10:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>On Friday, detectives working on a tip in the area of the Park Street MBTA station at around 1:40 p.m., spotted a man, later identified as Robert Gaul, 45, of Boston, who matched the suspect's description.</p>
      <p>After confirming Gaul was the suspect they had been looking for, officers arrested him. </p>
      <p>During his booking process, police found out Gaul had two other warrants out for his arrest out of Lowell for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon on a person over 60 and another one out of Brockton for aggravated assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.</p>
      <p>Gaul had also been using the alias Robert Booker.</p>
      <p>He is being charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, but it is unclear if there could be any additional charges.</p>
