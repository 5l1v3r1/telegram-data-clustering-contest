      <p>Meanwhile, <b>Legit.ng</b> earlier reported that President Buhari <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276319-buhari-clears-air-sacking-osinbajos-35-aides.html">reacted to reports of sacking some aides </a>from the office of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.</p>
      <p>Fielding questions from reporters at the Presidential Wing of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja, upon his return from a private visit from the United Kingdom on Friday, November 15, the president said it was unfortunate that his directive was interpreted as a sack.</p>
      <p>He explained that the 35 aides were not sacked from the office of the vice president but were instead redeployed to a new ministry.</p>
