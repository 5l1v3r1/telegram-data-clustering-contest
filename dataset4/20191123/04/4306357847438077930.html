      <h2>Charlie Nicholas looks ahead to Arsenal's home clash against Southampton on Saturday</h2>

      <h3>Charlie Nicholas is backing Arsenal to claim a dominant 4-1 win over Southampton in their Premier League clash at The Emirates on Saturday afternoon.</h3>
      <p>The Gunners head into the game looking to return to winning ways after the disappointment of their 2-0 loss to Leicester City last time out.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have only won four of their opening 12 games in the Premier League this season and that poor run of form has heaped pressure on Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>The north London side are down in sixth place in the table and already eight points behind fourth-placed Manchester City heading into this weekend’s round of games.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have only managed won Premier League win in their last five top-flight outings and they will be hoping to claim the three points when they host 19th-placed Southampton on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Former Arsenal star Nicholas is not expecting the Gunners to have any problems when they host the Saints at The Emirates this weekend.</p>
      <p>Writing in his column for <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12090/11866441/charlie-nicholas-premier-league-predictions">Sky Sports</a>, Nicholas said: “This will have been a banker in the past. Southampton normally don’t get anything at the Emirates in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>“By now, the Arsenal players will have returned and Unai Emery will have had some words to say to them. These are two managers under scrutiny.</p>
      <p>“Southampton are getting credit after their response to the 9-0 drubbing but they keep getting beat. The goalkeeper and the back three are still vulnerable.</p>
      <p>“Alexandre Lacazette was not on international duty and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been a bit quiet recently, so it is time for Arsenal to get back to winning ways. They are sixth in table and have been awful.</p>
      <p>“Chelsea are going to Manchester City, which could bring back a little belief once more that the top four is achievable. These are the games you are expected to win and Arsenal will win.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal are aiming to try and break back into the top four this season after they finished fifth and without a trophy in Emery’s first campaign in charge last season.</p>
