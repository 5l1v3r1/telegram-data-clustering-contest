      <p>The crowd that assembled Friday evening prayed together and shared stories about the young woman who lost her life. Several family members spoke fondly of Harrison.</p>
      <p>“She was a sweet, generous caring person. She would give you the shirt off her back,” said Ron Price, one of Harrison’s cousins.</p>
      <p>Family members told WBTV they had been filled with sadness since learning of Harrison’s death.</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t believe it. I couldn’t believe it. I still can’t believe it,” said Price.</p>

      <p>While it’s not uncommon for vigils to have an undertone of sadness, some family members at Friday night’s gathering expressed their anger for what happened. They had harsh words for Harrison’s accused killer.</p>
      <p>“You’re dead dirty. You’re a coward. You’re a loser. You’re a punk,” said Heiress Lasco, one of the victim’s cousins.</p>
      <p>Tre Terrell, one of Harrison’s cousins made a plea Friday night for the community to stop the violence.</p>
      <p>“Black people, we have to stop killing each other. We have to stop. The cycle has to end somewhere. Let it end now,” said Terrell.</p>
      <p>Family members tell WBTV that Harrison will be buried Saturday. Her death marks Charlotte’s 97th homicide of 2019.</p>
