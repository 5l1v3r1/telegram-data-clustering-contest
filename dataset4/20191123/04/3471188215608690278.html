      <h1>Dynamic email is coming to mobile devices, through Gmail</h1>

      <p>Dynamic email is a really cool concept, it (in a very basic way) turns email into a current content delivery rather than static. This feature has been available on Gmail for web for some time, but is now rolling out to iOS and Android Gmail clients.</p>
      <p>The G Suite Blog outlines how the rolling changes will affect the way users interact.</p>
      <blockquote>Dynamic email brings the richness and interactivity of AMP to your mobile device, allowing you to take action directly within a message. You can respond to a comment, RSVP to an event, manage subscription preferences, and more.</blockquote>

      <p>Data within the dynamic emails can be updated, allowing the information source to keep information current, even for an email delivered weeks earlier. This has huge potential in business and sales environments, or even if thereâ€™s a sporting or community event that arrangements may change for.</p>
      <p>Keep your eyes peeled and let us know how else you can see dynamic email being useful.</p>
