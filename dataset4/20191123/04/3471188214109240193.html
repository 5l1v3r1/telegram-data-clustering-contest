      <p>Valve, Steam’s parent company, announced last month that it was adding a new beta feature that would enable you to play local multiplayer games over the internet with your friends across Windows, Linux, and macOS computers. It seems that this beta feature has now come out of the beta status and you can now play with your friends using iOS and Android devices as well.</p>
      <p>To enable this feature, the host just needs to own, install and start the game. Friends who own a PC or Mac can join in via Steam Remote Play or if on a mobile device, say Android or iOS, those users can also join by simply using the Steam Chat and Steam Link apps.</p>
      <p>The key point to take from this is that the host must own the game outright on their profile.</p>
      <p>You can watch a video explaining about the new Remote Play feature below:</p>
