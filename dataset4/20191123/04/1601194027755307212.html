      <h3>NXT introduces women's team?</h3>
      <p>On tonight's episode of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/smackdown">SmackDown</a>, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">NXT</a> finally revealed one of their teams for Survivor Series. Up until now, the black and gold brand has kept their representatives secret. However, with one final showdown between the women of each brand taking place, it seems that Triple H and the rest of the brand felt that tonight was the best time to shock the world.</p>
      <p>Not only was <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/rhea-ripley">Rhea Ripley</a>, one of the breakout stars of this storyline, named captain of the team, but all four of her allies accompanied her to the ring. Mia Yim, Tegan Nox, and Candice LeRae, three more of NXT's best and brightest, stood shoulder to shoulder with the Mosh Pit Kid. There was one final surprise, though, that took the WWE Universe by <b>STORM</b>!</p>

      <p>Former NXT UK Women's Champion, the woman that actually defeated Rhea Ripley for said title, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/toni-storm">Toni Storm</a> also accompanied Ripley to the ring. They rallied around Ripley who, in a pretty impressive and creative move, was able to pin Charlotte Flair while she had Sasha Banks locked in the Figure-8.</p>
      <h3>Storm reacts to her surprising debut</h3>
      <p>Following the match, Toni Storm was interviewed backstage to get her reaction to the madness. Cathy Kelly asked Storm what she thought about trending on Twitter as she made her main roster debut.</p>
      <blockquote>I mean, I didn't know that but, of course. Obviously. Of course.</blockquote>
      <p>Storm didn't seem to be too surprised about the news. When asked about being included in Survivor Series, though, Storm kind of left the WWE Universe with a not so black and white response.</p>
      <blockquote>I mean, I haven't been formerly asked. But I can't just sit in the UK and let everyone have the fun. Maybe I'll be there or...maybe I won't be. Maybe I will? I guess we'll see.</blockquote>

      <p>At the moment, there has been no official confirmation on if any of the woman accompanying Ripley would be joining her on Sunday. Corey Graves and Michael Cole specified it several times, but considering the segment was a meeting of all three teams tonight, it's quite possible that we've seen NXT's picks. If that's the case, adding Toni Storm is a great decision.</p>
