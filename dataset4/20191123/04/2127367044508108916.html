      <h1>Ishant Sharma Credits "Healthy Competition" For Success On Pink Ball Test Debut</h1>
      <h2>Ishant Sharma returned figures of 5/22 in India's pink ball debut to bowl out Bangladesh for 106 in the second session of the second Test.</h2>

      <p>Ishant Sharma on Friday said the "healthy competition" among India's pacemen makes him excel after he claimed five Bangladesh wickets on <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/india-vs-bangladesh-2019-20/virat-kohli-ishant-sharma-steal-the-show-on-day-1-of-pink-ball-test-vs-bangladesh-2137137">day one of the first day-night Test</a> for both the teams. Ishant returned figures of 5/22 in <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/india-vs-bangladesh-2019-20/day-night-test-sourav-ganguly-says-pink-ball-match-a-huge-step-forward-for-test-cricket-2137172">India's pink ball debut</a> to bowl out the tourists for 106 in the second session of the second Test of the two-match series after they elected to bat first in Kolkata. He was ably supported by fellow quicks Umesh Yadav and <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/india-vs-bangladesh-2019-20/mohammed-shamis-probably-got-the-best-seam-position-says-india-bowling-coach-bharat-arun-2133657">Mohammed Shami</a> who shared the remaining five wickets between them.</p>
      <p>"I think the important thing is that we have a very healthy competition. It will only improve your performance," said Ishant, who claimed his first five-wicket haul in India after 12 years.</p>
      <p>"If there's no competition and if you are comfortable with what you are doing. I mean (if) you don't have someone to challenge your place, I don't think you can perform this well."</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old Ishant took three wickets in his team's opening win of the series as Shami led the pace pack with his seven scalps in the match.</p>
      <p>Ishant played second fiddle to Shami and Yadav in the team's recent 3-0 sweep over South Africa when he took two of the 26 wickets picked by the Indian seamers.</p>
      <p>"I am enjoying my cricket right now. I used to put a lot of pressure on myself before," said Ishant, who has reached 287 wickets in his 96th Test.</p>
      <p>"Earlier I used to think that I am beating the batsmen but still not taking wickets. Now I don't think all that. All I tell myself is that I have to take wickets. </p>
      <p>"Obviously, I have the experience and so I need to adjust to the conditions as soon as possible."</p>
      <p>Ishant struck first, trapping Imrul Kayes lbw for four with his newly-developed incoming delivery to the left-hander.</p>
      <p>He also bowled Nayeem Hasan, a right-hand batsman who later pulled out due to concussion fears, with an away going ball.</p>
      <p>"You may have observed before I normally used to bowl outswingers to left-handers. I needed to add variation because your game improves only when you add variety," said Ishant.</p>
      <p>"So, in this match, Imrul Kayes dismissal was that ball and the two bowled dismissals too. Batsmen think the ball will move after pitching but it goes straight."</p>
      <p>Ishant said not being part of the limited-overs squad is also not playing his mind as he remains in a happy space.</p>
      <p>"Somewhere you do feel bad but I am at such a stage in my life I have stopped worrying about these things," said Ishant. "They don't affect me."</p>
      <p>India were 174 for three at stumps, leading  Bangladesh by 68 runs. Skipper Virat Kohli, on 59, and Ajinkya Rahane, on 23, were at the crease.</p>
