      <h1>Spurs news: Why Christian Eriksen should be worried, Ricardo Pereira on transfer interest</h1>
      <h2>The latest Tottenham news as Jose Mourinho prepares for his first game in charge of Spurs against London rivals West Ham United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T04:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Doyle</a></address>
      <p>It has been a busy few days for Tottenham Hotspur - and Jose Mourinho in particular.</p>
      <p>The new <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Spurs</a> head coach has been getting used to his new surroundings after being appointed on Wednesday, less than 12 hours after Tottenham had confirmed the shock departure of Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Mourinho then met with the Spurs players on Wednesday at Hotspur Way, before holding his first training session that afternoon and <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/mourinho-spurs-press-conference-live-17292513">facing the media</a> for the first time as Tottenham head coach on Thursday.</p>
      <p>He is now preparing to take charge for the first time as Spurs face West Ham at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>And ahead of that game, we take a look at the latest Spurs news, below.</p>
      <h3>Why Eriksen should be worried</h3>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur legend Chris Waddle has insisted that Christian Eriksen is on borrowed time after the appointment of Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>The Danish playmaker has been in and out of the Spurs team this season after refusing to sign a new contract with the club.</p>

      <p>The 27-year-old can sign a pre-contract with any European club as early as January 1 with his current Tottenham deal up in the summer.</p>
      <p>Similarly, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld's contracts expire in the summer. With Mourinho appointed, there has been some suggestions that the 'contract rebels' could be tempted to resign on fresh terms.</p>
      <h3>Pereira speaks amid Spurs interest</h3>
      <p>Leicester City star Ricardo Pereira has spoken about his future amid rumoured interest from Spurs in the right-back.</p>
