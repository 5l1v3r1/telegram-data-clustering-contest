      <p>The closure of Nigeria's borders is really affecting Ghana, a parliamentarian from the country, Clement Humado, has lamented.</p>
      <p>According to Humado, the closure of the Nigeria-Benin border is the most devastating to his country as several trucks from Ghana were stranded at Seme-Krake side of the border.</p>
      <p>He disclosed this on Friday, November 22, while presenting the country report at the ongoing Second Ordinary Session of <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1138831-5-aims-objectives-ecowas.html">ECOWAS</a> Parliament held in Abuja.</p>
      <p>Going further, he said Ghana trucks returning from Nigeria with goods cannot also cross the border.</p>
      <p>However, he said Nigeria might have good reasons for the closure but<i> </i>the measures infringe on the provisions of the ECOWAS Trade Liberation Scheme (ETLS).</p>

      <p>Mahama, however, described the total closure of Nigeria’s borders as “unfortunate.”</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng </b>gathered that while speaking at the seventh Realnews magazine anniversary lecture held in Lagos, on Tuesday, November 19, Mahama said the attacks and expulsion of foreigners from South Africa and the border closure in Nigeria were the two biggest blows to the recently signed African Continental Free Trade Area (ACfTA) pact.</p>
