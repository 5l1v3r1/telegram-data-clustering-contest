      <p>Maui firefighters fully contained a large brush fire in Kahikinui on Maui.</p>
      <p>Crews will monitor the area for any flare-ups throughout the day today.</p>
      <p>Firefighters initially responded to the brush fire on Piilani Highway in the area of mile post 26 at about 1:40 p.m. Thursday.</p>
      <p>Strong winds fanned the flames northwest toward the Kahikinui Homesteads, according to county officials.</p>
      <p>The large brush fire that scorched about 300 acres prompted a road closure of a portion of the highway and forced residents in at least a dozen homes to evacuate.</p>
      <p>The county opened a temporary shelter at Keokea Community Center to accommodate evacuees.</p>
      <p>Officials closed the shelter and affected residents were allowed to return to their homes Thursday night after the fire department lifted the evacuation.</p>
