      <p>Taisen Maddern, CEO and Founder of BlueAnt has said:</p>
      <blockquote>“The X1 and X2 deliver sound you can literally see; the deep bass is evident the moment you turn the device on and holds through any listening experience,” and “If sound is what people are after, they can now turn to the X1 or X2 which deliver a premium experience at the best price point on the market.”</blockquote>
      <p>Spec wise, the two ranges of speakers are more alike than different, but there are some key differences, so lets have a look at what you get for the price for both :</p>
