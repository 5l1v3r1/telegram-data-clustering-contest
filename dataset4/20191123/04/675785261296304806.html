      <h1>What has 'stopped' Kylie and Kendall Jenner supporting Caitlyn in I'm A Celebrity</h1>
      <h2>Caitlyn Jenner has been in Australia for more than a week but her daughters Kylie and Kendall have continued to snub her efforts in I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T04:05:39+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 04:05</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Caitlyn Jenner has become one of the favourites in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> camp but she still has been snubbed by her daughters, more than a week after she touched down in Australia.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old I Am Cait reality star has been ignored by Kylie and Kendall Jenner since she embarked on her jungle adventure.</p>
      <p>With each day that passes without any public messages of support, it becomes a bigger 'elephant in the room' as Caitlyn appears to be more isolated from her family than ever.</p>
      <p>Her son Brody has already declared that he is not interested what she gets up to on the ITV show but Kylie and Kendall have decided to turn a blind eye to it at all.</p>

      <p>Instead, it has been business as usual for the pair on social media, with billionaire make-up mogul Kylie promoting her new range for the Christmas holidays.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, supermodel Kendall has been reminiscing with bikini and swimsuit shots of her from a modelling assignment from a previous year.</p>
      <p>Kendall's pics of herself in green underwear and then a leopard skin bikini met with approval from her BFF Hailey Baldwin, as well as comments of support from fellow model Gigi Hadid.</p>

      <p>Kylie has been glamming it up in a red bow and little else for a series of snaps to promote her new bright red Christmas lip kits, sending pulses racing yet again with her sultry displays.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old also posted a pic of her daughter Stormi Webster, captioning it with: "Coolest girl I know."</p>
      <p>This was backed up by Kim and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/khloe-kardashian">Khloe Kardashian</a> , who shared their love for the pic but also continue to ignore Caitlyn's efforts in the jungle.</p>

      <p>There have already been some Kardashian secrets spilled in the jungle camp, with Caitlyn recalling how Kim had dropped out of full-time education so that she could start a business selling used clothes from the great and good of Beverly Hills.</p>
      <p>While the relationship between Caitlyn and the KarJenners has been strained in the past, it would seem that it is not just the miles between her and the family that is widening the current alleged rift between them.</p>
