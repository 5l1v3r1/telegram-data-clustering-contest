      <h1>Residents cry for help as flood takes over Lagos community</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T03:15:52+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 03:15</time> by <a rel="author">Nwosu Victoria</a></address>
      <p>A community in Isolo local government area of Lagos state, Community road in Ago palace way has become ravaged by flood, throwing residents, shop owners and commuters in distress. The flood, which is a result of the persistent rainfall and bad drainage system in the community has defied all solutions and are calling on the state and local governments to come to their aid.</p>
      <p>Eucharia Amaka, a businesswoman whose shop is located along the road is concerned about the flooding, saying she has lost many customers. “The bad drainage system is the main reason for this flooding. There is nowhere for the water to go out that is why the roads are flooded. Gradually, the water is becoming stagnant. It has affected sales so badly because no customer would want to step inside the dirty water just to get something they could easily get elsewhere”</p>
      <p>Favour Amara, a resident of Ago palace way lamented that it has become very difficult to leave her street and has to make use of a commercial motorcycle to move around. Pleading for urgent intervention from the government to arrest the problem posing a threat to their sources of livelihood, one Uche Ezeifem said, “We need the government to come to our rescue. I am a widow and I feed my family from this business. I cannot afford to loose all my customers. It is not just about fixing the roads but about constants checks and maintenance too. If this is not taken care of soonest, we might probably vacate the area”.</p>
