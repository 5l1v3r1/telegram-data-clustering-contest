      <p>Hailey Baldwin has decided not to throw herself a birthday party this year, because she’s too tired to entertain.</p>
      <p>Yup, the model turned 23 years old on Friday (22 November) and revealed in an interview that while she had every intention of hosting a Michael Jordan themed bash to mark the moment, she later decided against it.</p>
      <p>Hailey had wanted to pay homage to the basketball star on her 23rd birthday, as 23 had been the number on Jordan’s back throughout his career.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/">Highsnobiety magazine</a>, Hailey said: ‘It’s my Jordan year. I’m turning 23, and I had this idea where I was going to throw a Jordan party and everyone would have to wear Jordan. But I’m just too tired, I don’t want to entertain people.’</p>
      <p>Err, suit yourself then.</p>

      <p>While she might not be having a party to celebrate, Hailey did have plenty of her pals wishing her happy birthday on social media, including her husband Justin Bieber, who she wed back in September for the second time, and Kendall Jenner.</p>

      <p>Justin left little to the imagination, as he <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/justin-bieber-wife-hailey-baldwin-want-babies-next-season-singer-reveals-family-plans-11204340/">basically declared he wants babies with wife Hailey next year</a> while marking her birthday.</p>
      <p>Sharing snaps from their wedding day to Instagram, he gushed in his caption: ‘Happy birthday babes! You make me want to be better everyday! The way you live you life is so attractive.. ps you turn me on in every way next season BABIES.’</p>

      <p>Kendall, meanwhile, shared a series of throwbacks to her Instagram story, calling Hailey her ‘other half’ and telling the star she will ‘love her forever’.</p>
      <p>Cute.</p>
      <p>Hailey’s lack of birthday plans come after the whole drama between her, Biebs and his ex Selena Gomez, after Selena dropped new track Lose You To Love Me, which is heavily rumoured to be about her break up from the Baby singer.</p>
      <p>Selena can be heard singing about being ‘replaced’ in two months ‘like it was easy’, which some fans took as a dig at Justin, who got engaged to Hailey last July, shortly after he broke things off with Selena.</p>
      <p>Hailey was then accused of throwing shade at Selena by sharing a screenshot of song I’ll Kill You by Summer Walker, but she slammed such claims.</p>
      <p>In a now-deleted comment <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/23/selena-gomez-fans-convinced-hailey-baldwin-threatened-kill-lose-love-release-10967144/">Hailey had urged fans to stop stirring up trouble</a> and wrote: Please stop with this nonsense… there is no “response”, this is complete BS.’</p>
