      <h1>NASS inauguration: Dozie Nwankwo unifies citizens as he returns</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T03:16:20+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 03:16</time> by <a rel="author">Christian Chime, Onitsha</a></address>
      <p>Anambra state citizens, especially those of the Njikoka, Dunukofia and Anaocha councils have been reassured of abundant democracy dividends by Chief Dozie Nwankwo, who took oath of office last Thursday as he was formally inaugurated by the leadership of the Federal House of Representatives, Abuja.</p>
      <p>Nwankwo was sworn in after successfully reclaiming his mandate at the Court of Appeal Elections Petitions tribunal, Enugu Division on Nov 1,2019.</p>
      <p>The inauguration which was witnessed by all and sundry, including the Minister of Transportation, Chibike Amechi, Anambra deputy Governor Nkem Okeke, Senators Victor Umeh and Rochas Okorocha, Obiora Okonkwo, national and state assemblies members, ended with a dinner.</p>
      <p>Nwankwo while thanking everyone for their prayers and support said he was overwhelmed and deeply touched by their kind words, support and show of love, particularly all through the rigours of the legal tussle that stretched to the Court of Appeal.</p>
      <p>At the inauguration dinner, Senator Umeh expressed immense joy that Nwankwo (who is popularly called “Onye Ndozi”, meaning the great Builder) was restored back to his seat.</p>
      <p>He described him as a great son of Anambra and APGA, urging him to remain focused to keep attracting quality dividends of democracy for the citizens of the state. While congratulating Nwankwo, Rochas Okorocha described him as a bright young man who has demonstrated immense zeal to achieve greater political height.</p>
      <p>Nwankwo saluted the judiciary for living up to its bidding as the bastion of hope for all which made it possible for him to recover his mandate which was stolen twice by the PDP. He however saw it as a no victor, no vanquished situation. He welcomed all his opponents, urging them to join hands and collectively develop the area. He reiterated that he would continue to attract life-enhancing programs and projects to the area/state for the benefit of all.</p>
      <p>Nwankwo replaced Valentine Ayika, a former member of the state assembly who allegedly refused a collective offer to return to the State Assembly to enable Nwankwo unfettered reelection cruise to consolidate on his achievements at the Green Chamber of the National Assembly.</p>
