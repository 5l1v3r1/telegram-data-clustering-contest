      <p>On Wednesday, clashes erupted at Toronto’s York University between pro-Palestinian protesters and attendees of an event that featured former Israeli troops.</p>
      <blockquote>"What happened that night was shocking and absolutely unacceptable. Anti-Semitism has no place in Canada. We will always denounce it [and] all forms of hatred," Trudeau said in a Twitter post on Friday.</blockquote>
      <p>Trudeau’s statement echoes those made by Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Toronto Mayor John Tory, both of whom <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201812171070767255-yellow-vests-protests-canada/">denounced the violence</a> and the expression of any hateful rhetoric.</p>
      <p>The condemnation follows a demonstration by members of York’s Students Against Israeli Apartheid (SAIA), protesting an event that <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201810201069053993-topless-peta-canada-goose-protests/">featured a panel discussion</a> with Reservists on Duty, an organization of former members of the Israeli Defence Force (IDF), that turned violent.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators, including some with concealed faces and bearing Palestinian flags, chanted "Viva, Viva, Intifada" – an Arabic word that translates to rebellion or uprising. Eventually, the protest turned violent with SAIA members engaging in skirmishes with event attendees, some of whom were <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201508021025318909/">identified online as Jewish</a> Defence League (JDL), a Jewish far-right religious-political organization, members, at which point Toronto Police had to intervene.</p>
      <p>The unrest is just the latest case in a string of incidents at York University, which has been the epicentre of a long-simmering conflict between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups in Toronto.</p>
