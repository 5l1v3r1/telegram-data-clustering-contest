      <h1>If you're Grey Cup bound on Sunday, don't plan on driving, organizers say</h1>

      <p>If you have tickets to the big show at McMahon Stadium on Sunday, be ready to hop on a train or call for a ride-share, because you’re not going to find any parking.</p>
      <p>Grey Cup officials say the best options for getting to the showdown between the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Winnipeg Blue Bombers are taking transit, pre-purchasing parking at the University of Calgary or using a ride-share option.</p>
      <p>“Anyone with a game ticket can ride transit for free thanks to our friends at the City of Calgary and then we do have our partners at the University of Calgary who are going to do a presale lot,” Mike Franco, chairman of the 2019 Grey Cup Festival, said Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>“If you buy your parking in advance, which you can do at <a href="http://greycupfestival.ca/">greycupfestival.ca </a>… then you can park there and we do have some shuttles bringing people back and forth from those lots. There’s, of course, ride-share and taxi lanes through some of those road closures.”</p>
      <p>There will be no parking at McMahon Stadium.</p>
      <p>Calgary Transit has upped its CTrain frequency from 11 a.m. until the end of service for heavier usage. Feeder buses on routes 9, 20, 31 and the Max Orange line all will get you to the game.</p>
      <p>Heavy road closures between 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. are expected throughout the McMahon Stadium area on Sunday, too, with residential parking restrictions in nearby neighbourhoods also in effect.</p>

      <p>University Drive N.W. between 16th Avenue N.W. and 24th Avenue N.W. will be closed, while Crowchild Trail between those avenues will have restricted lanes and a 50 km/h speed restriction.</p>
      <p>There will be no access to northbound Crowchild Trail from 16th Avenue, while Banff Trail N.W. will be closed at the Banff Trail CTrain station.</p>
      <p>“The one thing I’ll say is people should not drive down and try to find a spot on game day,” said Franco. “The City of Calgary and police service have told us there’s going to be no residential parking. The University of Calgary won’t be able to accept (purchases of) tickets on the day of the game, so everything needs to be done in advance.”</p>
      <p>And the good news for those who haven’t had a chance to snag their tickets but are considering doing so, Franco said there are still tickets left.</p>
      <p>“I think we are inside 1,500 tickets now to reach the finish line,” he said, adding there are hopes the clear 3 C weather expected by Environment Canada will bring a few more people out.</p>
      <p>“I sure hope (we’ll sell out),” said Franco. “The way it’s trending I think we are going to put ourselves in a really good spot for Sunday that we’ll have a packed house with an incredible environment for those two teams to fight for Canada’s biggest annual championship. This is the contagious part. You want to be a part of a Grey Cup here in Calgary.”</p>
