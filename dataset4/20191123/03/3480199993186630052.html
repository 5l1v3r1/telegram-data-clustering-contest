      <p>Kim Kardashian West has revealed she was reduced to tears after her outfit for the 2013 Met Gala was mocked online.</p>
      <p>Comedian Robin Williams was among those poking fun at the floral gown, which Kardashian West wore while she was heavily pregnant with her first child.</p>
      <p>Williams compared the dress to his appearance in 1993 comedy Mrs Doubtfire, in which he played a recently divorced father who dresses up as a female housekeeper to stay in touch with his children.</p>
      <p>Alongside a picture of himself in a floral outfit, Williams, who died in 2014, tweeted: “I think I wore it better!”</p>

      <p>In a video for Vogue, Kardashian West, 39, revisited some of her best and worst outfits, recalling the Givenchy gown she wore to accompany husband Kanye West to the 2013 Met Gala.</p>
      <p>When she hit the red carpet, Kardashian West was the target of taunts online, with Twitter users comparing her to a sofa.</p>
      <p>“I think Robin Williams even tweeted it, said I looked like Mrs Doubtfire,” she said. “I was crying the whole way home because I just couldn’t believe it.”</p>
      <p>The reality TV star was heavily pregnant for the event, which is one of the biggest dates in the fashion diary.</p>
      <p>“I was very pregnant, very puffy and bloated and I was like, ‘Oh god, of course the first time I go I’m gonna be huge,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Kanye was performing so I wasn’t actually invited, I was just Kanye’s plus one. And that was okay with me because I never really dreamed I would be at the Met Ball.”</p>
      <p>She added: “I know no one really probably wanted me there at the time.”</p>
      <p>The mother-of-four said designer Riccardo Tisci chose a stretchy fabric to accommodate her pregnancy and revealed there was originally a black version of the dress.</p>
      <p>Kardashian West said Tisci convinced her to opt for the floral version by saying: “What do you give a woman who is pregnant? You send her flowers.”</p>
