      <ul>
        <li>In a surprise development, BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis took oath as Maharashtra Chief Minister on Saturday</li>
        <li>After taking oath, the chief minister said Maharashtra needed stable government</li>

      <p>Devendra Fadnavis after taking oath as Maharashtra Chief Minister for the second consecutive term said that the state needed a stable government and not a 'Khichdi' government.</p>
      <p>"People had given us a clear mandate, but Shiv Sena tried to ally with other parties after results, as a result President's rule was imposed. Maharashtra needed a stable govt not a 'khichdi' government," Fadnavis told ANI.</p>
      <p>BJP, with 105 seats forged alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party which bagged 54 seats to garner the majority figure.</p>
      <p>NCP's Ajit Pawar took oath as Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>The move came at a time when deliberations between Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena seemingly reached the final stage on Friday. Earlier, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar had claimed that there was a consensus on Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister of the alliance government.</p>
      <p>The BJP, which emerged as the single largest party, could not stake claim to form a government as its ally Shiv Sena remained firm on rotating the Chief Minister's post and equal sharing of Cabinet berths.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena parted its ways with BJP to explore ways to form a government. It, however, failed to prove the support of the required number of MLAs in the time given by state Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari.</p>
      <p>The Governor had then invited NCP, the third-largest party, to prove its ability to form the government failing which President's Rule was imposed in the state.</p>
      <p>The BJP won 105 seats in the 288-member assembly followed by Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44.</p>
