      <p>WASHINGTON: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he will soon release a plan to let Florida and other states import prescription medicines to combat high drug prices, as he blasted the Democrat-led House of Representatives for not going far enough in a drug-pricing bill.</p>
      <p>"We will soon be putting more options on the table," Trump wrote in a series of tweets, adding that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi "and her Do Nothing Democrats drug pricing bill doesnâ€™t do the trick."</p>
