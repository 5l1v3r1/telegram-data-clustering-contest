      <p>“Ajit Pawar is the NCP legislature party leader and it means everyone has given support to the BJP”, Mr. Mungantiwar said amidst confusion over the exact number of MLAs of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supporting the fledgling government.</p>
      <p>“The BJP and its ally were given a clear mandate but the ally disrespected it. In order to respect the mandate given to us, we formed a government today with the support of 170 MLAs,” Mr. Mungantiwar, who represents Ballarshah seat, told reporters at his office.<i>— PTI</i></p>

      <p>"Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi we have once again managed to install a BJP-led government in the State," he says.</p>
      <p>"I welcome Ajit Pawar and his MLAs into our government. We will give a stable government to the people of Maharashtra for the next five years and work for poor and farmers.</p>
      <p>"It is a fact we have lost one friend (Sena) but found another in (Ajit Pawar). I want to assure people of state as long as Mr. Modi is there we will have a stable government in Maharashtra."</p>
      <p>4.10 pm</p>
      <h3>November 23 shall go down as black chapter of Indian history, says Surjewala</h3>
      <p>At a press conference, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewal said "November 23 shall go down in history of India as a black chapter when an illegitimate government was constituted at the instance of an Home Minister who considers constitution as his personal instrument, after scaring Ajit Pawar about jail."</p>
      <p>Mr. Surjewala also said "They have betrayed people of Maharashtra."</p>
      <p>He said "Prior to the elctions Devendra Fadanavis said that Ajit Pawar will be sent to Arthur Road jail for Rs 72000 crore scam. Instead they sent him to Maharashtra secretariat as deputy Chief Minister. That's why they say "Modi hai toh Mumkin hai".</p>
      <p>Mr. Surjewala said "In history of independent India when at the dead of night constitution was throttled, rule of law was mowed."</p>
      <p>He said "Governor acted as a hitman for Home Minister Amit Shah to sell the mandate of people."</p>
      <p>Mr. Surjewala said "Sharad Pawar has already cleared his stand. After his clarification there is no scope of doubt. Till today the NCP has not been split as per the laid down laws."</p>
      <p>He said "Shiv sena approached us on November 11, Congress has been the quickest to ensure that this alliance should be constituted. Whenever Mr Pawar held a meeting Congress representative was present. There was expeditious action despite initial reservations on day one."</p>
      <p>3.40 pm</p>
      <h3>BJP will prove the majority: Ravi Shankar Prasad</h3>
      <p>Defending BJP's move to join hands with Ajit Pawar, BJP leader and Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad blamed the NCP and Congress for the mess in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>The NCP and Congress were trying to capture the financial capital, Mr. Prasad said adding that the BJP had the people's mandate to form the government since it was the largest legislature party in the State.</p>
      <p>Mr. Prasad said they had the numbers and will prove it in the floor of the House, without saying how many MLAs supported the government.</p>
      <p>2.45 pm</p>
      <h3>Who is Dhananjay Munde?</h3>

      <p>Rajendra Shingne, the NCP MLA who was present at the early-morning swearing-in ceremony, where BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as the Chief Minister of the State, claimed he was not aware of the developments.</p>
      <p>"We were called at Dhananjay Munde bungalow by Ajit Pawar today morning. We were asked to come with him to Raj Bhavan and the swearing-in ceremony started. We were hurt. I have no intention to betray Sharad Pawar," Mr. Shingne said. NCP MLAs Sandeep Kshirsagar and Sunil Bhusara too said they were with Mr. Sharad Pawar.</p>

      <p>Of the eight MLAs who had gone with Ajit Pawar to Raj Bhavan, five have come back. They were told a lie, put into a car, almost like a kidnapping, the Shiv Sena leader said.</p>

      <h3>Sharad Pawar should join NDA, will be rewarded: Athawale</h3>
      <p>Squarely blaming the Shiv Sena for the dramatic turn of events in Maharashtra, Union minister Ramdas Athawale urged NCP chief Sharad Pawar to walk over to the NDA camp, hinting that he might be rewarded with a plum portfolio at the Centre.</p>
      <p>“Sharad Pawar, too, should consider revising his stance and joining the NDA. He may get some good portfolio at the Centre,” Mr. Athawale said when asked about the difficulty the NCP faction headed by Ajit Pawar might face in engineering a split before the floor test.</p>
      <p>Mr. Athawale, who heads the RPI a Maharasthra-based pro-Dalit outfit is the Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment in the Narendra Modi government.</p>

      <p>The opposition DMK in Tamil Nadu on Saturday described the political developments in Maharashtra, where BJP formed government with the support of NCP supremo Sharad Pawar’s nephew Ajit Pawar, as “disgusting.”</p>
      <p>“What can one call the politically disgusting (development) in Maharashtra... is it indecency or ugliness..what can it be compared with,” the DMK leader M.K. Stalin said in a Facebook post.</p>
      <p>“One feels even calling this a murder of democracy will become an understatement--if it will minimise the gravity of the situation... The face of Indian democracy has been blackened. This is a big shame,” he added.</p>
      <p>1.40 pm</p>
      <h3>We will tackle it politically and legally, says Ahmed Patel</h3>
      <p>Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel, who has rushed to Mumbai, told the media that his party is with NCP and Shiv Sena.</p>
      <p>Condemning the government formation and calling it "anti-democratic," Mr. Patel said: "The secret swearing in ceremony of Devendra Fadnavis shows that something is wrong in this. This is anti-constitutional."</p>
      <p>"The process of government formation in Maharashtra with Congress , NCP and Sena was in progress. The talks between Cong and NcP were positive. Even the three party meet yesterday was positive as well.</p>
      <p>"All three parties are together. We will defeat the BJP and those who are forming the govt with the BJP," he added.</p>
      <p>1.15 pm</p>

      <p>"Let's see who the people of Maharashtra are with. This is a question of existence for all the three parties. Especially, it's a matter of prestige for the Thackeray family," he tweeted.</p>
      <p>Mr. Singh  asked the Maharashtra Governor if he had received a letter of support from the NCP. "The Governor should have asked the NCP MLAs to take oath only after receiving a letter from the NCP president Jayant Patil," he said.</p>

      <p>Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray says, "this is shameful what is happening in the name of democracy."</p>
      <p>We don't play night games. We don't split parties, Mr. Thackeray says.</p>
      <p>This is a surgical strike on Maharashtra. We will not tolerate. We are together and we will remain together, he adds.</p>
      <p>I don't think elections are even needed. Everyone knows what Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj did when betrayed and attacked from the back, Mr. Thackeray says.</p>
      <p>1.00 pm</p>
      <h3>They don't have the numbers: Sharad Pawar</h3>
      <p>In a joint press conference with Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, NCP chief Sharad Pawar says the new government won't be able to prove its majority. "They don't have the numbers."</p>
      <p>"Ajit Pawar has taken two lists of MLAs from party office claiming those were support letters. Those signs were for party's internal programme. It had nothing to do with govt formation," the senior Pawar says.</p>
      <p>"If this has been done, then the Governor too has been duped," he adds.</p>
      <p>We are together, we will remain so. We are ready to face any difficulty. We will face it collectively, Mr. Pawar says.</p>
      <p>12.50 pm</p>
      <h3>No intention to hurt NCP, says party MLA who took part in swearing-in ceremony</h3>
      <p>Rajendra Shingne, the NCP MALS who was with Ajit Pawar has came to Sharad Pawar's press meet.</p>
      <p>"We were called at Dhananjay Munde bungalow by Ajit Pawar today morning. We were asked to come with them to Raj Bhavan and the swearing in ceremony started. We were hurt. I have no intention to betray Sharad Pawar. I am with NCP," Mr. Shingne.</p>
      <p>12.40 pm</p>
      <h3>Party was not aware of Ajit's decision: Sharad Pawar</h3>

      <p>Mr. Pawar says:</p>
      <p>"Some members of NCP had gone with Ajit Pawar to Raj Bhavan without informing us or the party,  but one of the MLAs called us up and informed us this was happening.</p>
      <p>"This decision to go to Raj Bhavan was Ajit Pawar's own decision and those who went with him may or may not be aware of the law related to defecting.</p>
      <p>"Whatever happens from here, it would be hard for the BJP government to prove majority on the floor. We are together and we remain together with Shiv Sena from here."</p>
      <p>12.30 pm</p>
      <h3>Political immorality of the BJP has reached its nadir: CPI (M)</h3>
      <p>The political immorality of the BJP has reached its nadir the CPI(M) said reacting sharply to the developments in Maharashtra. </p>
      <p>"The clandestine manner in which the Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra have been sworn in shows the extent to which the BJP can stoop to grab power,"the CPI(M) Polit Bureau said in a statement. </p>
      <p>BJP did similar political machinations, the party said, in Goa, Karnataka and north eastern states. </p>
      <p>"It is unfortunate that both the Constitutional authorities – President’s office and the Governor’s office – have been misused to achieve their political purpose," the statement added. </p>

      <p>As many 15 MLAs were present with Ajit Pawar during the oath taking ceremony, he said.</p>
      <p>He blamed Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut for the developments.</p>
      <p>"The BJP and our leaders blame Sanjay Raut for these developments in the State and we will not forget the language he has used against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He is responsible for this mess between BJP and Shiv Sena," he said.</p>

      <p>AICC Secretary Sanjay Dutt said that the role of Governor has come under scanner.</p>
      <p>"The role of Governor Shri B.S. Koshyari has again come under the scanner for the hush-hush manner BJP CM was sworn in. While he refused to extend time to other parties, BJP wasn't even asked to show proof of majority, before swearing-in. It is invitation to horse-trading," he said.</p>

      <p>BJP State president Chandrakant Patil blamed the suprise move on Sena's indecision.</p>
      <p>"BJP and Shiv Sena had a clear mandate but Sena did not respect it. People of this State have watched what went on between the three parties even as farmers were suffering. So Mr. Fadnavis was compelled to take the oath," he said.</p>

      <p>"Ajit Pawar was with us all night in the meeting, but his body language was suspicious. He stepped out of the meeting and his phone was switched off," said Mr. Raut.</p>
      <p>"Sharad Pawar has nothing to do with this, and I can say that with confidence. Ajit Pawar has cheated not only the voters of the State but even his own uncle," he said.</p>
      <p>"The BJP is behind this. More than NCP's split, it is the BJP which has lured the NCP leader and MLAs using unconstitutional means," he added.</p>
      <p>Mr. Raut added that the one who can cheat his own uncle will never be forgiven by the people of the State. "The people of the state are watching how money and power was used to effect this coup and this is nothing less than a crime," he said.</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena leader also criticised the Governor. "We though that the Governor came here to protect law and order, but instead he administered oath to BJP leaders keeping people of the State in dark," said Mr. Raut.<i>— as reported by Sharad Vyas</i></p>

      <p>"In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (2) of article 356 of the Constitution, I, Ram Nath Kovind, President of India hereby revoke the Proclamation issued by me under the said article on the 12th day of November, 2019, in relation to the State of Maharashtra with effect from the 23rd day of November, 2019," the notification said.</p>
      <p>The notification was digitally signed by the concerned official at 5.47 a.m. on Saturday before being uploaded on the official gazette portal- egazette.nic.in.</p>
      <p>An official said that a notification can only be digitally signed once the physical copy has been signed by the President of India. The timeline suggests that the Union Home Ministry worked overnight to prepare the notification and the President signed it before 5.47 a.m. on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Last time when the proclamation imposing Central rule was issued, home ministry officials waited for Mr. Kovind to return from Punjab. After he signed the proclamation, Central rule was formally imposed at around 5.30 p.m. on November 12 even though the Governor sent a report around 12 noon the same day recommending Central rule. — <i>as reported by Vijaita Singh</i></p>
