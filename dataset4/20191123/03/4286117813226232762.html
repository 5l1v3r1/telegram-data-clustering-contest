      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>NCP leaders in complete shock after stunning twist</li>
        <li>NCP not behind Ajit's defection: Sharad Pawar</li>
        <li>Sharad Pawar had nothing to do with it: Praful Patel</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sharad Pawar says his Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) had no hand in his nephew Ajit's astounding decision to join a BJP-led government.</p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar himself said he reached the decision on his own.</p>
      <p>Other NCP leaders -- Chhagan Bhujbal, Nawab Malik, Jayant Patil and Jitendra Awahad -- said they had no idea of what was to come. Praful Patel said Sharad Pawar had nothing to do with it.</p>
      <p>Indians watched open-mouthed on Saturday as their TV screens showed Devendra Fadnavis of the BJP and Ajit Pawar <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/devendra-fadnavis-maharashtra-cm-again-1621847-2019-11-23">taking oath as Maharashtra's chief minister and deputy chief minister</a>, respectively.</p>
      <p>That image -- which appears to have left the political establishment just as shellshocked -- came very much against the run of play: for days now, the NCP, the Congress and the Shiv Sena have been working on a prospective alliance, irrespective of their differing ideologies.</p>
      <p>As recently as Friday evening, Sharad Pawar said the new alliance wanted Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray to be its chief minister.</p>
      <p>Well, it looks like the Sena can forget about that for now.</p>
