      <p><b>CONWAY, S.C.Â (AP)</b> - Timmy Allen scored 19 points and Utah beat Ohio 80-66 on Friday night in a Myrtle Beach Invitational consolation game.</p>
      <p>Both Gach had 18 points and Rylan Jones finished with 17 points to help the Utes (4-1) bounce back from a loss to Coastal Carolina in the quarterfinals. They shot 49%, led by 21 and turned 14 turnovers into 26 points.</p>
      <p>"It was ugly last night," coach Larry Krystkowiak said of the Coastal Carolina loss. "We broke down the film and we were deficient in a lot of different areas. I thought we bounced back really well. We came out with a great focus, we played hard and we shared the basketball."</p>
      <p>Utah missed 11 of its final 12 shots and did not make a field goal in the final 5 minutes - but made up for that by making 27 of 28 free throws, including 13 of 14 down the stretch. Only Riley Battin's miss with 29 seconds remaining - on the team's final attempt - kept the Utes from being perfect at the line.</p>
      <p>"They're called free for a reason and often times they get overlooked," Krystkowiak said. "It's not the fact that you make most of them, it's the one-and-ones. Those little things add up and 27 points is remarkable for our guys."</p>
      <p>Jason Preston scored 21 points and Ben Vander Plas added 13 for the Bobcats (3-3), who have lost three in a row.</p>
      <p>The Utes, who began the tournament shooting 40% from 3-point range, made 47% of their long-range attempts after they hit just 18% against the Chanticleers.</p>
      <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>Ohio: It's been a rough weekend in South Carolina for the young Bobcats, who twice have been beaten soundly by power-conference schools. They should get a fairer gauge of their progress under first-year coach Jeff Boals on Sunday when they face Middle Tennessee.</p>
      <p>"Our sense of urgency and our will to win had to be greater than theirs and I thought theirs was better than ours," Boals said. "That's what good teams do, they respond. Our guys compete and battle, we've just got to continue to learn from this."</p>
      <p>Utah: This was an encouraging bounce-back performance for the young Utes. They looked more like the team that beat Nevada and Minnesota, and not the one that was run off the floor a night earlier by Coastal Carolina.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>Ohio: Faces Middle Tennessee on Sunday night in the seventh-place game.</p>
      <p>Utah: Takes on Tulane on Sunday in the fifth-place game.</p>
