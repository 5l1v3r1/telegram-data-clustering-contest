      <h1><i>Fantastic Four</i> Director Josh Trank Reviews 2015’s<i> Fantastic Four</i> on Letterboxd</h1>

      <p>Sometimes, the only way to really watch a movie is through the lucent lens of hindsight, which is presumably why <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/fantastic-four/"><i>Fantastic Four </i></a>director and screenwriter Josh Trank took to Letterboxd Friday to write <a href="https://letterboxd.com/joshuatrank/film/fantastic-four/">his own review</a> of his much-maligned 2015 Marvel reboot. “The movie is ALRIGHT,” he writes. “I was expecting it to be much worse than it was. I literally haven’t seen it since like two weeks before it came out, and I was in a heavily fucking traumatized state of mind. Why? Eh, save that for another time.”</p>
      <p>If you recall the timeline of the movie’s release, <i>Fantastic Four </i>became <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2015/08/timeline-of-fantastic-fours-terrible-buzz.html">an early and frequent target</a> for online clowning. The film, Trank’s second feature following 2012’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/chronicle/"><i>Chronicle</i></a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fantastic_four_2015">current stands at a 9 percent</a> on Rotten Tomatoes, though, the director notes, not due to a dearth of talent in his cast, which featured Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara, and Jamie Bell.</p>
      <p>“Everyone in the film is a great actor, and overall there is a movie in there, somewhere,” Trank writes. “And that cast deserves to be in THAT movie. Everyone who worked <i>Fant4stic</i> clearly wanted to be making THAT movie. But … ultimately … It wasn’t.”<b> </b></p>
      <p>Muses the director, “I was 29 years old, making my 2nd film, in a situation more complicated than anything a 2nd-time filmmaker should’ve walked into. That said … I don’t regret any of it.” Concludes Trank, “It’s a part of me.” You can read his full self-review <a href="https://letterboxd.com/joshuatrank/film/fantastic-four/">here</a>.</p>
