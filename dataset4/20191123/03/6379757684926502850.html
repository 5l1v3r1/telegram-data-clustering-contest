      <p>He added that, the computer Labs will also improve various research at the college, thus improving wildlife conservation and tourism in the country and in the world at large.</p>
      <p>The CAWM-Mweka Rector, Prof Jafari Kideghesho explained that, apart from 35 computers that are connected with the internet and GIS all worth 98.5 mil/-, USAID has also facilitated them with strategic business plans.</p>
