      <h2>Also cooling down with some ice cream.</h2>

      <p>Aside from being a three-time <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/grammys">Grammy Award</a> winner and one of the most respected names in hip-hop today, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/chance-the-rapper">Chance the Rapper</a> can now add survivor of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/hot-ones"><i>Hot Ones</i></a> to his list of achievements. Joining host Sean Evans for the latest installment of the First We Feast series, Chano showed off his pain tolerance while testing his spice tolerance with the spice gauntlet.</p>
      <p>Reaching the midpoint of the challenge with relative ease, Chance starts drinking a lot of milk as the heat level and questions begin to pick up. As he continues, the Chicago rapper discusses <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/kanye-west">Kanye West</a>‘s recent gospel transformation and the relationship between rap and the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/chicago-white-sox">Chicago White Sox</a> while cooling down with some ice cream. To round up Chance the Rapper’s battle with the wings, Evans offers hypotheticals to see if Chance will leave his independent roots and sign to a label.</p>
