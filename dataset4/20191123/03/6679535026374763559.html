      <p>In an unexpected turn of events, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar took oath as Maharashtra Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister respectively in Raj Bhavan on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>The move has come as a total shock in the State as a meeting of all three parties on Friday night had unanimously agreed to make <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/uddhav-thackeray-should-lead-the-government-says-sharad-pawar/article30051268.ece">Shiv sena chief Uddhav Thackeray as the leader of the new government</a>.</p>

      <p>"The State is suffering from farmer problems. The instability in the State is not good for the development of the State. It was important to form the government. Ajit <i>dada</i> came with us and we approached the Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and claimed to form the government. The President's rule was removed and we decided to take oath today itself," said Mr. Fadnavis, while talking to news agency <i>ANI</i> at Raj Bhavan.</p>

      <p>Mr. Pawar, who was not accompanied by any of the NCP leaders, said that the State needed a stable government and the formation of three-party government was taking time.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"It was not good for the State. So I decided to support the BJP government," he said. Mr. Pawar, being the leader of NCP legislature party, had the signatures of all party MLAs on a support letter.</p>
      <p>The NCP leaders were unavailable for comment. The move by Mr. Pawar to support the BJP comes three days after NCP chief Sharad Pawar's meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
