      <p>A scary scene unfolded in Denver tonight during the Celtics-Nuggets game as Boston’s star point guard Kemba Walker was stretchered off the court with what appeared to be a neck injury.</p>
      <p>Walker appeared to be reaching for a lose ball when he stumbled forward and went head first into a teammate’s body. He immediately dropped to the floor and was attended to by medics for several minutes before being stretchered off.</p>
      <p>Here’s a look at how it happened.</p>

      <p>This is not what anyone wants to see happen on the court, no matter what team you’re cheering for. Walker received a standing ovation as he left the building.</p>
      <p>We’ll have more updates as we get them. In the meantime, we’ll be praying for him.</p>
