      <h1>Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira 'targeting transfer to Napoli'</h1>
      <h2>Carlo Ancelotti's Serie A side are the favourites to sign unsettled Gunners ace Torreira, according to latest report from Italy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T03:05:45+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 03:05</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira could be set for a January transfer to Napoli, according to latest reports from Italy.</p>
      <p>Torreira is reportedly keen on a return to Italy after the 23-year-old's agent Pablo Bantancur revealed he was unhappy at having his role in the team changed by Gunners boss Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>And while Inter Milan and AC Milan would be interested in signing the Uruguayan ace, Napoli are at the front of the queue.</p>
      <p>That's according to Italian outlet <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/en/news/unsettled-arsenal-star-eyes-napoli-move-12416">Calciomercato</a> , which says Napoli boss Carlo Ancelotti would be keen on using Torreira to replace transfer-listed midfielder Alan.</p>
      <p>After impressing last season from a deep-lying midfield role, Torreira is said to be unhappy at having been asked to play further forward this season, and at his lack of game time having started just four Premier League matches so far this season.</p>

      <p>Calciomercato reports that the player is eyeing a move back to Italy - where he previously played for Pescara and Sampdoria - knowing that Serie A teams would utilise him in his preferred deeper role.</p>
      <p>And the publication says Napoli is Torreira's most likely destination as the club strives to build bridges amid a rough patch of relations between players, fans, the club's management and the board.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Emery <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/unai-emery-issues-warning-arsenal-20938561">challenged Torreira to improve</a> if he wants to hold down a regular spot in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal's</a> midfield.</p>
      <p>“Lucas played well last year. This year he’s not been consistent," Emery said. "My challenge to him is to improve, do better with tactical issues, but above all be consistent.</p>

      <p>“He is young. His process here is starting. He only started playing in the Premier League last year.</p>
      <p>“Being a defensive midfielder is a big responsibility. He needs to achieve confidence, play more matches and get more experience to get that confidence.</p>
      <p>“He can play that role - but we need a defensive midfielder to be offensive."</p>
      <p>Torreira is contracted to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> until the summer of 2023.</p>
