      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics">Boston Celtics</a> point guard <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6479/kemba-walker">Kemba Walker</a> was diagnosed with concussion-like symptoms after being stretchered off the court late in the second quarter of Friday night's game in Denver.</p>
      <p>Walker was transported to a local hospital for further evaluation and was later released to rejoin the team for its return to Boston, the Celtics announced. He will be reevaluated Saturday.</p>
      <p>Walker ran headfirst into the abdomen area of teammate <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3056602/semi-ojeleye">Semi Ojeleye</a> and immediately fell to the floor. Early indications were that Walker did not suffer a significant injury in the collision, sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.</p>
      <p>Celtics coach Brad Stevens said after the game that he didn't have an update on Walker's status but that the scans Walker underwent at halftime yielded good results.</p>
      <p>"I saw him in the ambulance at halftime that took him to the hospital, and he was -- he had his wherewithal, and in pretty decent spirits, which was good, obviously," Stevens said.</p>
      <p>Walker grimaced in pain as he went down, and play was stopped as medical personnel from both teams tended to him. He remained on the floor for several minutes.</p>
      <h3>Woj: There's optimism Kemba has avoided a significant injury</h3>
      <p>Adrian Wojnarowski says the Celtics have diagnosed Kemba Walker with concussion-like symptoms, but there is optimism he avoided a significant neck injury.</p>
      <p>Walker's teammates gathered around, as did Nuggets players. A brace was placed around his neck to stabilize the area, and he was strapped to a backboard before being placed onto a gurney and wheeled off the court.</p>
      <p>"It's tough on both teams to see that," Stevens said of the impact the injury had on the rest of the game, a 96-92 win for the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/den/denver-nuggets">Nuggets</a>. "And it was good to get at least early reports of good news from our standpoint. But the head injury thing is super scary, and -- so you're always thinking about it, and you still have to play the last 27 minutes, which is not a fun part of it, but I thought our guys and Denver competed really hard the rest of the game."</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the Celtics lost <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4249/gordon-hayward">Gordon Hayward</a> to a fractured left hand. He suffered the injury when he collided with <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2983/lamarcus-aldridge">LaMarcus Aldridge</a> in a Nov. 9 game against San Antonio.</p>
      <p>Ojeleye said he and the rest of the Celtics were praying that Walker's injury "wasn't as bad as it looked."</p>
      <p>"I don't ever want to be a part of that, anybody getting injured, especially your teammate, so I'm just praying he gets back as fast as possible," he said.</p>
      <p>Walker, 29, entered the game averaging a team-leading 22.6 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.8 assists in his first season with Boston.</p>
