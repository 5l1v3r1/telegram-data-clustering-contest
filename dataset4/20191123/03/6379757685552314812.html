      <p>The Coast Region-based club registered their fourth loss of the league season when they were beaten 2-1 by Namungo FC at Majaliwa Stadium in Lindi before the international break on November 6.</p>
      <p>Ruvu Shooting have claimed 15 points from 11 matches in the 2019/20 season.</p>
      <p>Ruvu Shooting may be up against 19-time league champions but the former’s head coach Salum Mayanga is confident of good results.</p>
      <p>He has challenged his side to end the winless run against the Msimbazi Street club when they meet in today’s showdown.</p>
      <p>Ruvu Shooting are yet to register a win against Simba, nicknamed ‘Msimbazi Reds’, in the Vodacom Premier League since September 2010 – which is a run of 15 losses and a draw.</p>
      <p>“Simba are not so indomitable though they are rightly praised for having a very strong squad this season. We are having the same preparation we had against Yanga early this season, why wouldn’t we take maximum point against them?’’ he asked.</p>
      <p>He confidently added: “All taboos are made to be broken, this is the year to end our winless run against Simba and Yanga, whether we play them at home or away.”</p>
      <p>On the opening day of the season Mayanga managed to help Ruvu Shooting end their 16-match winless run against Yanga when a solitary goal netted by Sadat Nanguo gave them a 1-0 victory at Uhuru Stadium.</p>
      <p>Simba, meanwhile, head into the clash with doubts lingering over the future of head coach Patrick Aussems.</p>
      <p>Aussems is widely believed to be the next Vodacom Premier League coach on the chopping block.</p>
      <p>The sentiment has been strengthened by the 56-year old Belgian tactician’s decision to dodge questions about his future this week in the wake of his employers saying he travelled out of the country without following due procedure.</p>
      <p>Aussems is rumoured to have gone to South Africa formalize talks with the country’s Premier Soccer League side, Polokwane City.</p>
      <p>Be that as it may, Simba's chief executive officer, Senzo Mbatha, has since moved to dismiss speculations, it is only a matter of when not if Aussems will become the latest coaching casualty this season.</p>
      <p>The back-to-back champions are four points clear atop the standings but they know rivals, Young Africans (Yanga), have enough matches in hand to make up the points difference.</p>
