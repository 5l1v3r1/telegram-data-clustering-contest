      <h1>Devendra Fadnavis Returns As Maharashtra CM In Last Minute Twist</h1>
      <h2>Ajit Pawar to be deputy CM as sources claim NCP leader Sharad Pawar was behind the surprise alliance.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T03:31:59+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 03:31</time> by <a rel="author">Nehmat Kaur</a></address>
      <p>Mere hours after media reports claimed <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/shiv-sena/v">Shiv Sena</a> chief <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/Uddhav-Thackeray/">Uddhav Thackeray</a> was going to be <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/maharashtra/">Maharashtra</a>’s chief ministry, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/bjp/">BJP</a>’s <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/Devendra-Fadnavis/">Devendra Fadnavis</a> has been sworn in as the state’s leader, ending the state’s deadlock in a surprise twist. </p>
      <p>Last night, everyone expected to wake up to a NCP-Congress-Shiv Sena government. </p>

      <p>However, PTI reported that president’s rule was revoked at 5:47am on Saturday, 23 November. </p>

      <p>In an even more surprising development, the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/ncp/">National Congress Party (NCP</a>’s) Ajit Pawar is going to be deputy chief minister of the state, leading to questions about whether Ajit has split from NCP leader <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/Sharad-Pawar/">Sharad Pawar</a>. </p>
      <p>Soon after news of the swearing in ceremony broke, the senior Pawar took to Twitter to confirm that Ajit has broken away from the NCP. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>However, ANI quoted sources as saying the senior Pawar was the mastermind behind the bait and switch, and Ajit acted with his assent. </p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1198077013518475264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>Fadnavis, after being sworn in, said, “People had given us a clear mandate, but Shiv Sena tried to ally with other parties after results, as a result President’s rule was imposed. Maharashtra needed a stable govt not a ‘khichdi’ govt. </p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1198070501110796289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>Maharashtra’s assembly election results left the state on tenterhooks after the BJP and Shiv Sena failed to get a majority and also ally with each other, with both parties jostling for the top job.</p>
      <p>This led to an elaborate political dance between the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena, with many believing, up until this morning, that the three parties would rule Maharashtra in a three-party alliance. </p>
