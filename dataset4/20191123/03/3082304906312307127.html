        <b>Bayern Munich interim manager, Hansi Flick, has confirmed that the club has promoted Indian-origin starlet Sarpreet Singh to the first team. A New Zealander by birth, Singh joined the club this summer and will now train with the senior team along with Joshua Zirkzee, Oliver Batista Meier, and Leon Dajaku. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Hansi Flick has confirmed that Bayern Munich have promoted four reserve players to the senior team. Among those players is Indian-origin New Zealander Sarpreet Singh, who joined the club this summer from Wellington Phoenix.</p>
      <p>“We’ve promoted four youth players to the senior team, Joshua Zirkzee, Oliver Batista Meier, Sarpreet Singh and Leon Dajaku,” Flick <a href="https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/bayern-munich-promote-youth-stars-sarpreet-singh-zirkzee-batista-meier-dajaku-8268">said in a pre-match press conference</a>.</p>
      <p>“We’re convinced that these boys will develop in the best way if they train with the best players. In our first-team, they have the conditions to do that.”</p>
      <p>Singh was born to Indian parents in Auckland, New Zealand, and started his career playing for Onehunga Sports. His talents were soon spotted by A-League side Wellington Phoneix, who enrolled Singh into their academy.</p>
      <p>The attacking midfielder rose through the ranks in Wellington, before making the first team for the 2017/18 season. He became a regular for the club the following year and was awarded with a national team call-up.</p>
      <p>Bayern Munich scouted Singh during the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup and officially signed him on July 1, 2019. The 20-year-old was sent to the reserve side for whom he scored five goals and provided four assists, before being promoted to the senior team.</p>
