      <p>The world athletics governing body recognized the eight athletes who broke 1500 meters and one mile (1600 meters) record at the gala, dubbed Mile Night.</p>
      <p>Bayi said the event was organized by Chris Turner, the Head of IAAF Heritage. Other record breaking athletes who were recognized by IAAF were Kipchoge Keino of Kenya, Adi Bile of Somalia, Eamon Couglan from Ireland,</p>
      <p>“The event was also attended by Council Member of IAAF, Prince Nawal Bin Mohammed Al Saud, former athletes and journalist,” Bayi noted.</p>
      <p>The world athletics governing body said the mile is the last remaining imperial distance still applicable for world record ratification.</p>
      <p>The mystique of the mile (1609.344 meters) is the key for it remaining an official record distance.</p>
      <p>Over the course of 160 years of documented record attempts, the mile has lured athletes from across the world to tackle one of the key benchmarks of human athletic achievement, IAAF said.</p>
      <p>Bayi was born in Karatu District, Arusha in 1953. He has won many medals at various events, but he set the record on February 2, 1974 in men's 1500m final at the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, New Zealand.</p>
      <p>This is a race that is often described as the greatest middle distance event of all time.</p>
      <p>His record time in the race was three minutes and 32.2 seconds.</p>
      <p>Part of the IAAF letter to Bayi acknowledged that since the association’s formation in 1912, the men's world mile record has been held by athletes from Algeria, France, Finland, Morocco and Sweden.</p>
      <p>Athletes from English-speaking countries, Australia, Britain, New Zealand, Tanzania, and the USA, with whom the mile is arguably more closely associated, have too held the record.</p>
      <p>It further said: “The numerous attempts in the first half of the last century to break the four-minute barrier made headlines and dominated news reels across the world.”</p>
      <p>Bannister’s 3:59.4 run on 6 May 1954 is arguably one of the greatest sporting moments in twentieth century history, the letter said.</p>
      <p>“That the record run of fellow Briton Diane Leather Charles later that month, who became the first woman to dip under five minutes (4:59.6 on May 29), went largely unheralded is a sad reflection of the times but not of her marvelous achievements.”</p>
