      <p>White House officials are reportedly charming Republicans ahead of the impeachment vote by taking them to the historic presidential retreat, Camp David.</p>
      <p>Acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and other top White House officials have been hosting weekend getaways with House Republicans as President Donald Trump remains under intense scrutiny amid the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>Daily activities at the presidential retreat include making s'mores, going hiking, and shooting clay pigeons, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-opens-up-camp-david-as-an-adult-playground-to-woo-gop-lawmakers-during-impeachment/2019/11/22/ec6e7810-0c6f-11ea-8397-a955cd542d00_story.html">The Washington Post</a> reported. Alongside the daily itinerary, guests are also free to enjoy an on-site arcade, bowling alley, golf course, hot tub, and shooting range.</p>
      <p>One lawmaker who attended a weekend getaway described Camp David as an "adult playground." Others were in awe of the "famous White House staffers and other dignitaries who have slept in the same beds," participants told The Post.</p>
      <p>"I've worked with a number of Republican presidents over various administrations... and I've never, ever been invited to Camp David," Rep. Ann Wagner told The Post. "It was amazing to go for the short weekend. So historic."</p>
      <p>Invitations to Camp David have become the "envy of the conference," after attendees called the trips as "surreal" and "incredible," according to six Republicans that talked to The Post.</p>
      <p>Aside from organizing weekend retreats to Camp David, the White House hosted weekly lunches for Republican senators. Fifty out of 53 senators have attended the lunches with the president, according to The Post report. Trump has also met with or personally reached out to 100 House Republicans since the beginning of the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>"It's an impressive effort to engage at the member level," one GOP lawmaker told The Post. "My colleagues have been blown away by it. And by the way, notice Republicans are united on impeachment."</p>
