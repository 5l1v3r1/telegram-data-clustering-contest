      <h1>Rabbit out of a hat! Van Gisbergen snatches Race 31 pole position in Newcastle</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T03:10:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 03:10</time> by <a rel="author">James Pavey</a></address>
      <h3>Shane van Gisbergen pulled a rabbit out of the hat to clinch pole position for Race 31 at the Coates Hire Newcastle 500.</h3>
      <p>Van Gisbergen was the first driver out in the fight for pole, and as rivals came and went, the 2016 champion’s 1:10.2817s lap proved too far out of reach.</p>
      <p>Series champion Scott McLaughlin was third man out, and missed van Gisbergen’s time by just 0.0627s to be the meat in a Red Bull Holden Racing Team sandwich.</p>

      <p>It was a sublime performance by van Gisbergen, who nearly missed the Shootout altogether after sneaking into the top 10 in a thrilling qualifying session.</p>
      <p>The result marks the first time since 2009 (Garth Tander, Tasmania) that the first driver out in the Shootout walked away with pole.</p>
      <p>“The car has been awesome all weekend, just no good on new tyres,” said van Gisbergen, praising his team for turning the car around on set-up.</p>
      <p>“I was just stoked with that, they did a great job tuning it, getting the tyre phasing better.</p>
      <p>“I just can’t believe we went from 10th there to the front. It’s critical here.</p>
      <p>“Beside my mate Scotty, so it’ll be good.”</p>
      <p>The 95-lap Race 31 will commence at 4:15pm AEDT.</p>
