      <p>We may only be approaching Thanksgiving, but it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas at the Grand Canyon. </p>
      <p>Snow blanketed the famed Arizona, national park on Thursday. The official Twitter account for the site warned visitors to expect icy roads. </p>
      <p>"An overcast morning on the South Rim, after receiving around 3 inches of snow last night. Caution park roads and footpaths are icy," <a href="https://twitter.com/GrandCanyonNPS/status/1197526612125851648?s=20">@GrandCanyonNPS</a> tweeted along with a photo of a view from early Thursday. "There is a possibility of additional snow throughout the day."</p>
