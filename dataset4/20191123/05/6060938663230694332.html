      <ul>

      <p>KOLKATA: The script could not have been penned better. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/wriddhiman-saha">Wriddhiman Saha</a>, who has grown up playing most of his cricket at the Eden Gardens, became the fifth Indian wicket-keeper to complete 100 dismissals in the longest format on the opening day of the inaugural D/N Test at Indian cricket's greatest amphitheatre on Friday.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old got to the milestone when he held Shadman Islam off pacer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/umesh-yadav">Umesh Yadav</a>.</p>
      <p>Former India skipper MS Dhoni has most dismissals for an Indian wicket-keeper in the longest format of the game with 294. Apart from Dhoni, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Syed-Kirmani">Syed Kirmani</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kiran-More">Kiran More</a> and Nayan Mongia, too, have a century (or more) of dismissals.</p>
      <p>While a lot of talk before the Test hovered around how the batsmen will negotiate the pink ball in the twilight zone or how much purchase both pacers and spinners will get from it, if any at all, there was hardly any discussion on the role of the wicket-keeper or fielders.</p>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> shed some light on it during his pre-match press conference and felt that the pink ball hit the hands harder.</p>
      <p>It must have hit Saha's gloves harder, too, as he had to endure a tricky day after Bangladesh skipper Mominul Haque won the toss and elected to bat on Friday.</p>
      <p>Although the pitch looked docile in the first few overs, the ball suddenly started moving about and it seemed India were playing either in Nottingham or Johannesburg.</p>
      <p>Saha, though, kept expertly in trying conditions and his display reminded one of what coach Ravi Shastri said last month when the Siliguri-born stumper returned to the India Test side. "Saha is the best 'keeper' in the world, and at home, where the bounce can be variable, his 'keeping' is invaluable," Shastri had stated.</p>
      <p>Indian pacers <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ishant-sharma">Ishant Sharma</a>, Umesh Yadav and Mohammad Shami on Friday were making the pink ball talk as it started to seam prodigiously. Not only were the batsmen all at sea, even Saha was tested.</p>
      <p>In the eighth over of the match and Shami's first, left-handed Shadman Islam was beaten all ends up as the ball zipped past him at good pace. Saha was blinded initially but still managed to collect it diving to his right. He reached the milestone taking a spectacular diving catch in front of Virat Kohli at first slip to dismiss the opener off Yadav.</p>
      <p>He followed it up with another brilliant diving catch to send back the experienced Mahmudullah off the bowling of Ishant Sharma.</p>
