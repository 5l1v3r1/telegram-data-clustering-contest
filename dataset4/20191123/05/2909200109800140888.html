      <p>Sacked Dr Baffour Awuah whose appointment as the Director-General of the Ghana Health Service(GHS) was withdrawn only two weeks after it was announced is set to be re-appointed, MyNewsGH.com reports.</p>
      <p>The disclosure about his possible reappointment to a different and much higher position was made Chairman of the ruling NPP in the Ashanti region, Bernard Antwi Boasiako a.k.a Chairman Wontumi.</p>
      <p>Wontumi asked the embattled Dr. Baffour Awuah to wait for an opportune time for a bigger appointment.</p>
      <p>It is unclear what must have caused the presidency to make the sudden u-turn but Wontumi argues that this is not the first time an appointment into public office has been withdrawn by a president.</p>
      <p>He says the President has the prerogative to hire and fire, so Dr Baffour Awuah must accept his disappointment in good faith and hope for an even better position.</p>
      <p>It’s been speculated that the withdrawal of Dr Baffour Awuahs’s appointment was due to the fact that he was unknown to the New Patriotic Party.</p>
      <p>Wontumi told sit-in host, Nana Kwame Adjei Bohyen on Angel in the Morning on Thursday monitored by<a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/"> MyNewsGh.com</a> that, he “didn’t know the medical doctor until he was introduced to him by his Secretary, Sam Pyne and the MP for Bantama, Daniel Okyem Aboagye, days after his appointment was announced”.</p>
      <p>1st Vice Chairman of the NPP in the Ashanti region, Kwabena Nsenkyire also corroborated the pronouncement of his boss that, Dr Baffour Awuah was unknown to the party hierarchy.</p>
      <p>“Infact I was part of those who mounted a smear campaign against him when his name was announced and I told him point blank that he was unknown to the party”, he also said on Angel FM.</p>
