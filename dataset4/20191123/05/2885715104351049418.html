      <h2>Bohemian Rhapsody makers are planning to make a film on Michael Jackson. The movie is expected to span Jackson’s journey from child star to a global icon that ended when he died in 2009 at age 50.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T05:18:39+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 05:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/reuters/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Michael Jackson’s story is headed for Hollywood from the producer who helped make hit film Bohemian Rhapsody, industry media reported on Friday.</p>
      <p>Deadline, Variety and the Hollywood Reporter said producer Graham King had secured the rights, including music, from Jackson’s estate to make a feature film about the life of the Thriller singer, whose legacy has been tarnished by allegations of child sex abuse.</p>
      <p>The movie is expected to span Jackson’s journey from child star to global icon that ended when he died in 2009 at age 50 of an overdose from a powerful sleeping aid just weeks before a planned comeback concert.</p>
      <p>Deadline, citing unnamed sources, said the film “isn’t intended to be a sanitized rendering” of Jackson’s life.</p>
      <p>King’s production company and the Jackson estate did not immediately return calls for comment.</p>
      <p>Jackson was tried and acquitted in 2005 on charges of molesting a 13-year-old boy. In 1994, he settled a sexual abuse civil lawsuit concerning another 13 year-old boy.</p>
      <p>His reputation came under scrutiny again this year because of the Emmy-winning documentary Leaving Neverland in which two men gave emotional accounts of what they said was sexual abuse by the singer in the 1990s when they were boys.</p>
      <p>Jackson’s family attacked the documentary and his estate denounced it as a “rehash of dated and discredited allegations.”</p>
      <p>Despite the publicity, the Jackson estate is backing a new Broadway musical about the singer, due to open in July 2020. A Michael Jackson show One from Cirque du Soleil continues to play in Las Vegas, and stage musical “Thriller Live” has been playing in London since 2009.</p>
      <p>Bohemian Rhapsody, a musical biopic about Queen frontman Freddie Mercury who died of AIDS in 1991, won four Oscars this year, including for lead actor Rami Malek. It has taken more than $900 million at the global box office.</p>
      <p>Deadline said the script for the Jackson movie will be written by John Logan, whose credits include The Aviator. No casting, expected release date or movie studio was announced.</p>
