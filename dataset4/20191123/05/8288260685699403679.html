      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T05:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Edwards, Graham Young, Marcus Queenborough, https://www.facebook.com/scottedwardsjournalist/, Laura Haynes, https://www.facebook.com/grahamyoungfilm?ref=hl, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/marcus-queenborough/</a></address>
      <p>Christmas has well and truly arrived in Birmingham with lights, the German Market and festive music filling the air wherever you go in the city centre.</p>
      <p>The video above shows some of the beautifully decorated shop windows, gifts and light displays on show around the city centre including the Bullring, Colmore Business District, Piccadilly Arcade and more.</p>
      <p>With just over a month to go before the big day, shops such as H&amp;M Home in the Bullring, John Lewis in Grand Central and Loake Shoemakers on Colmore Row have some wonderful displays to really get you into the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/christmas">spirit of Christmas</a>.</p>
      <p>Trees are popping up all over the city too, but they are all dwarfed in size when compared to the monster tree standing in Victoria Square in the heart of the German Market.</p>

      <p>Staying with the market, which is <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/beginners-guide-birmingham-german-christmas-17209307">now in it's 18th year in Birmingham,</a> a huge sign is a new feature this year which is on the end of New Street just opposite the World's biggest Primark.</p>
      <p>A slim tree filled with twinkling lights stands outside St Martin Church in the city centre with loads of people stopping to take photos on a bench with an LED raindeer.</p>
      <p>You can see some of the amazing photos you have taken in the gallery below.</p>
      <p>Looking over the St Martin Tree is the Snow House and Igloo Bar which has been incredibly popular with people who have been looking to have a nice drink without the hustle and bustle of the German Market.</p>
      <p>John Lewis have made the most of their Christmas advert this year with a giant 'Excitable Edgar' bursting from a Christmas cracker in a huge display in Grand Central.</p>
      <p>Other eye catching displays can be seen at the Piccadilly Arcade, a simple but effective set up can be seen at Loake Shoemakers on Colmore Row and a display of bits and bobs a plenty can be seen at the Great Western Arcade.</p>
      <p>Are there any stunning displays we've missed on our tour of the city centre? If so, let us know and share your pictures on Facebook and Twitter!</p>
