      <p>Even Queen Elizabeth II can occasionally walk among the public and avoid detection, at least according to an account from her former protection officer Richard Griffin. <br/><br/>Mr Griffin recalled a time when the monarch was approached by a group of American tourists while on a walk near the Balmoral Estate in Aberdeenshire at a recent talk, according to The Times. The group asked the Queen, who was wearing a headscarf and tweed coat, if she lived in the area, to which she responded simply by saying she had a house close–by. <br/><br/>“Have you ever met the Queen?” they asked.<br/><br/>“No,” she apparently replied, before pointing at the policeman and adding: “But he has.” The group were still none the wiser and left without realising whose company they had just shared.</p>
