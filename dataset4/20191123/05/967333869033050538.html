      <p>Washington DC federal Judge Richard Leon has ordered the government of Iran to pay Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian and his family "compensatory damages" in the amount of $180 million, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/us-judge-orders-iran-to-pay-180-million-in-damages-to-detained-post-journalist-jason-rezaian-and-his-family/2019/11/22/4911e5fe-0d63-11ea-8397-a955cd542d00_story.html">according to <i>The Washington Post</i>.</a></p>
      <blockquote>“Holding a man hostage and torturing him to gain leverage in negotiations with the United States is outrageous, deserving of punishment, and surely in need of deterrence", the judge wrote in a 30-page ruling.</blockquote>
      <p>The federal judge distributed the amount between Rezaian and his family members as $23.8 million to the journalist in compensatory damages for pain, suffering, and economic losses; $2.7 million to his brother, Ali; $2.7 million to his mother, Mary; and $150 million for the whole family in punitive damages, according to <i>WaPo</i>.</p>
      <p>Rezaian’s then-newlywed wife, fellow journalist and Iranian citizen Yeganeh Salehi, was not a plaintiff in the lawsuit against Iran, although she was <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201512261032323147-jason-rezaian-iran/">detained together with her husband</a> before being released after two months.</p>
      <p>Rezaian, who served as <i>The Washington Post’</i>s Tehran bureau chief, was arrested on 22 July 2014 and was charged with espionage and three other security-related crimes, including “collaborating with hostile governments” and “propaganda against the establishment”. The administration of US President Barack Obama<a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201504211021156972/">  urged Tehran many times to free the journalist,</a> accusing Iran of violating international law.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Rezaian was sentenced to several years in jail after being<a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201910101077003319-detained-in-iran-russian-journalist-yuzik-departs-for-moscow---embassy/"> indicted on all four charges</a>, including espionage and propaganda against the establishment.</p>
      <p>Rezaian, along with three other Americans, was released in January 2016 under a prisoner-swap deal with the United States, in exchange for seven Iranian-US nationals serving jail time in the US.</p>
      <p>The swap agreement also envisaged that the international criminal police group Interpol would cease prosecuting 14 other Iranian nationals.</p>
      <p>Following the prisoner swap exchange, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> alleged that the US had<a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201908081076498286-journalist-on-us-policy-towards-iran-washington-is-facing-a-situation-in-which-allies-are-fleeing/"> paid a ransom for the US nationals</a>, allegations that were denied by the Obama administration.</p>
