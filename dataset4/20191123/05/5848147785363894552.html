      <h1>‘Unbreakable’ windows shatter at unveiling of Tesla ute</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T05:51:22+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 05:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/" target="_blank">ABC</a></address>
      <p>Would you trade your ute for a Cybertruck? Elon Musk hopes so.</p>
      <p>The founder of electric carmaker Tesla has unveiled its new ute, which boasts a stainless steel body and “armour glass windows”.</p>
      <p>At a punk-show themed event in Los Angeles, Mr Musk claimed the truck’s “ultra-hard” exterior “won’t scratch and dent”.</p>
      <p>But the armoured glass window cracked like a spider web when hit with a metal ball during a demonstration.</p>
      <p>“Oh my f***ing God. Well, maybe that was a little too hard,” joked Mr Musk of the throw.</p>
      <p>The ball was then thrown at another window, which cracked the same way.</p>
      <p>“It didn’t go through,” Mr Musk said with a chuckle.</p>

      <p>But a sledgehammer demonstration did not end the same way. A hefty swing that was shown to bash in a typical door did not dent the Cybertruck’s doors.</p>
      <p>The six-seater vehicle marks the first foray by Tesla, whose Model 3 sedan is the world’s top-selling battery electric car, into utes — a market dominated in the United States by the Ford F-150, along with models by General Motors and Chrysler.</p>
      <p>“We need sustainable energy now. If we don’t have a pickup truck, we can’t solve it,” Mr Musk said.</p>
      <p>“The top three selling vehicles in America are pickup trucks. To solve sustainable energy, we have to have a pickup truck.”</p>
      <p>Its starting price will be US$39,900 ($58,800), less expensive than initially flagged, and is already available for pre-order before production starts in late 2021.</p>
      <p>“Cybertruck is designed to have the utility of a truck and the performance of a sports car,” Tesla said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Mr Musk earlier tweeted the design was partly influenced by the Lotus Esprit sportscar that doubled as a submarine in the 1970s James Bond film “The Spy Who Loved Me”.</p>
      <p>The Cybertruck drew mixed responses on social media and from industry experts, with many doubting its widespread appeal.</p>
      <p>“I just watched Tesla release the #cybertruck and honestly? My life feels complete,” wrote one punter.</p>
      <p>“It’s nice to see Elon Musk make a cardboard box car he drew in kindergarten,” tweeted another.</p>
      <p>Matt DeLorenzo, senior executive editor at automotive research company Kelley Blue Book wrote that “it will be a niche product at best and poses no threat in the pickup market as we know it today”.</p>
      <p>“‘It’ll grow on you,’ my mum told me when I didn’t like broccoli as a kid,” wrote Forbes tech columnist John Koetsier.</p>
      <p>“Perhaps Cybertruck will grow on me. But I doubt it.”</p>
      <p>Mr Musk — who faces a defamation lawsuit for calling a British caver a paedophile — told Recode last year that “I actually don’t know if a lot of people will buy this pickup truck or not, but I don’t care”.</p>
      <p>It was announced this week that Tesla’s giant battery in South Australia would have its output and storage increased by 50 per cent with help from the state and federal governments.</p>
      <p>The Cybertruck’s cracked windows are not the first time things have not gone to plan for Tesla.</p>
      <p>In April this year, footage emerged from China of one of its Model S vehicles exploding while stationary in a car park.</p>
