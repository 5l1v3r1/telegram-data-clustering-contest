      <p>A woman from Hucknall has shared her experience of 'a random act of kindness' after visiting her local supermarket.</p>
      <p>After purchasing a new handbag at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/tesco">Tesco</a> Extra in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/hucknall">Hucknall</a>, Clare Smith, 42 said she we "shocked" at what she found inside.</p>
      <p>She said: "I went to the store yesterday morning (Thursday, November 21) and picked out the handbag which was the only one, and it was right at the back of a rack.</p>
      <p>"I'd been looking for a new bag and not seen one I liked but this one stood out.</p>
      <p>"When I got it home, I was removing the packaging and putting my belongings in, and in a zipped pocket was an envelope.</p>
      <p>"Inside was the note and the money. It really shocked me."</p>

      <p>The note said, "all your dreams are possible, go for it, have faith in yourself," accompanied by a £5 note.</p>
      <p>Clare, who works in private cleaning, said she is deciding how she can use the money for a positive cause.</p>
      <p>"It really wasn't the money that got me though, but more the note. I've got it pinned up now.</p>
      <p>"I want to do something of a similar with the £5 rather than spend it.</p>
      <p>"I'd love to know who it was - I've since been told similar things have happened before in Hucknall. It's such a nice thing to do.</p>
