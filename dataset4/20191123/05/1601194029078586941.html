      <h3>What happened after SmackDown went off the air?</h3>
      <p>The main event of SmackDown featured a 3-on-3 tag-team match between <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/baron-corbin">King Corbin</a> and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/roman-reigns">Roman Reign</a>'s team which saw Corbin picking up the victory for his team by pinning Mustafa Ali. During the closing moments of the show, Seth Rollins' music hit the arena and he came through the crowd along with some RAW Superstars to surround the ring.</p>
      <p>Rollins entered the ring and immediately locked horns with Roman Reigns. After a few moments, NXT Superstars invaded the arena along with Triple H, Shawn Michaels, and Road Dogg. What followed was an all-out brawl between all three brands that closed the show.</p>
      <p>The footage showed that all the Superstars were still fighting with each other even after the show went off-air. SmackDown's Shorty G took to the air to take out a good number of Superstars at ringside and then Mustafa Ali took out some more Superstars when he delivered a Spanish Fly to Lio Rush and they fell outside the ring.</p>
