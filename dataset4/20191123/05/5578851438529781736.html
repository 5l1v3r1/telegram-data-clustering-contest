      <p>So far India has contributed more than $3 billion since 2001 in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>“The United States welcomes India’s substantial investment in and assistance to Afghanistan,” said Nancy Izzo Jackson, a State Department official in charge of Afghanistan, quoted by AFP.</p>
      <p>“And we will continue to support efforts to achieve an honorable and enduring outcome in Afghanistan that preserves our investment in Afghanistan's future,” she told a conference on India’s role in Afghanistan at the Hudson Institute.</p>
      <p>India constructed the new parliament building in Afghanistan as well as the Salma Dam, a hydropower dam in the west of Afghanistan.</p>
