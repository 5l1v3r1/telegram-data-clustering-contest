      <p>Shopkeepers in a city suburb are being forced to lock their doors during opening hours - amid fears crime is worsening in their area.</p>
      <p>A funeral directors, hairdressers and a veterinary clinic in Green Lane, Castle Bromwich revealed how they stay locked-up until a customer arrives for their own safety.</p>
      <p>News of the closed-door policy emerges just a week on from a devastating stabbing which sent shockwaves through the 'tight-knit community'.</p>
      <p>The victim, a man in his 30s, was brutally knifed outside Gregory's Fish Bar at 7.40pm on Monday, November 11.</p>

      <p>Quick-thinking shop workers rushed to his aid, bringing out towels to help stop the bleeding before the ambulance and police arrived on scene.</p>
      <p>He suffered a total of 11 knife wounds - which required seven hours of reconstructive surgery, a close relative told BirminghamLive.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/man-22-arrested-over-stabbing-17266462">22-year-old man was arrested days later</a> on Thursday (Nov 14) but was bailed pending investigation as the victim faces a long road to recovery.</p>
      <p>Local residents spoke of the spiralling crime in the area, as in many parts of Birmingham, as well as their fears to walk the streets.</p>
      <p>"Evil world we live in, frightened to go out," one said in response to the news, while another wrote: "How disgusting, can't go out anywhere."</p>
      <p>And some business owners within the shopping area don't even feel safe enough to keep the doors open to customers - and instead lock up during opening hours.</p>
      <h3>'It's really come to something when a funeral directors has to lock their door'</h3>
      <p>The owner of William H Painter Funeral Directors, who did not wish to be named, told how she recently started locking the door after she was attacked in the doorway.</p>
      <p>Speaking on her way to work, just across the road from the chippy, she said: "This area is getting worse you know.</p>
      <p>"I was attacked in my shop in November last year. A man came up to me and said to me 'I don't like the way you're talking to me'. I said: 'I haven't spoken to you' as I was just opening my shop up.</p>
      <p>"He just punched me straight through the door and I landed in the doorway.</p>

      <p>"This is why I get so scared around here - because of all this. I lock my door now, it's really come to something when a funeral directors has to lock their door. "</p>
      <p>She also spoke of shoplifters regularly stealing from the nearby Tesco and the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/smiths-wood-murder-what-know-16051873">fatal shooting of Leneto Kellengbeck in March</a> - which took place in nearby Arran Way, Smith's Wood.</p>
      <p>But the funeral directors isn't the only premises which hopes to shut out potential thugs or burglars with its closed-door policy.</p>
      <h3>'Our door is always locked'</h3>
      <p>The Veterinary Clinic at 128 Green Lane, which has been open about 21 years, keeps its doors permanently locked until its bell rings.</p>
      <p>"For the last 15 years, that's been the way we work here - our door is always locked. People have to ring the bell to gain admittance," explained manager Fay Lewis.</p>

      <p>"It's permanently locked, we have an internal system so that when the bell rings, a member of staff will look to see who's at the front door and let them in.</p>
      <p>"It does [help us feel safer] but obviously we can get people that we don't know, you never know who you're letting into the premises."</p>
      <p>The move to lock up during opening hours came after incidents in the waiting room.</p>
      <p>She said: "We had a couple of occasions where members of the public, not necessarily clients, were coming in and stealing from the waiting room."</p>

      <p>Crime does appear to be rising in the area, she agreed, with a large number of violent crimes reported on social media.</p>
      <p>"I'm a member of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/6952846540/">Castle Bromwich Facebook group</a>, and from what I can see, there's a lot of physical crimes being reported."</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Halo Hair &amp; Beauty also said it is 'policy' to keep the door locked until a customer arrives for safety reasons.</p>
      <p>When asked if Saydon Pharmacy keep its door locked, a staff member said: "We'd be at the front door every two seconds! The crime is the same everywhere to be honest.</p>
      <p>"Because we're a chemist we do get prone to certain things but no more than anywhere else to be fair. Years and years ago we had a ram raid, but that was many years ago.</p>
      <p>"We're on the ball here, we do have a system in place, if we're aware let's say that there's dodgy people outside the shop. We have our own little systems in place."</p>
