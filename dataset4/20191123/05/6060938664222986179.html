      <h1>No new deals till Tokyo Games: NRAI to shooters</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T05:56:34+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 05:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Sabi-Hussain-479250489.cms" target="_blank">Sabi Hussain</a></address>
      <p>NEW DELHI: The <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/National-Rifle-Association">National Rifle Association</a> of India (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/NRAI">NRAI</a>) has decided to enter a domain the athletes have always been sensitive about - their sponsorship and endorsement deals.</p>
      <p>The federation wants its Tokyo Olympics-bound shooters to put on hold their existing contracts with private sponsors till the Games in July-August 2020, and also refrain from signing any new deals till the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Olympics">Olympics</a>. A refusal to do so would mean missing the flight to Tokyo.</p>
      <p>A national federation bringing in a policy to dictate a shooter's sponsorship commitments is unheard of, but the NRAI has made up its mind. It wants to "protect" the Olympics-bound shooters from "exploitation" at the hands of money-minded corporates and greedy agents. The idea, as explained by NRAI president <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Raninder-Singh">Raninder Singh</a>, is to help shooters avoid getting distracted by the lure of money and also to protect the interests of shooters as young as 16-17.</p>
      <p>"Look, we lost three Olympic medals in the past because of this kind of exploitation. The shooters and their families will have to sign a bond till the Tokyo Games to follow the Olympic spirit. They can very well sign the deals, but I want to make sure that they don't sell themselves for small amounts. What I am trying to say is, 'come to NRAI, tell us about the proposal, we will evaluate it for you and if find it okay, we will give the permission and then sign it with the sponsor'. There is a need to protect our athletes because he/she is no longer an individual now, but someone who is representing the country. Some of them are just 15, 16 or 17 years old and don't know what is good or bad for them. The government has spent Rs 30 crore on shooting for Tokyo. Everything is on the line. I have to answer them," Raninder told a select group of reporters here on Friday.</p>
      <p>"If they still go ahead with the deal and cross the line, it could very well mean they are out of the Tokyo race. These shooters are like my kids. I'll give you an example of a particular shooter who has signed a contract with a social media website for Rs 2.5 lakh per month. He is No. 1 in the world in his category. Imagine 15-16-year-old kids getting paid Rs 50-60 lakh per year. That boy comes from a humble background and his parents are just running after the money. It is the NRAI's job to assist them. These sponsorship commitments are hampering their performances. They are spending most of their time on these endorsements when the focus should solely be on the Tokyo Games. This is where the bond will say that you will not force your child to do something which is not in his or her interest," Raninder added.</p>
      <p>The NRAI's sponsorship-controlling policy will be applicable to the 15 Olympics-bound shooters and the next 15 immediate reserves in the same event category, taking the total count to 30 shooters.</p>
      <p>But what about those who already have a sponsorship deal or have entered into a long-term contract? "You have to unsign those deals or I'll take them (sponsors) to the court and plug them. I'll get a stay on contracts from the court till Tokyo. As an NSF boss, I'll tell the court that my child is being exploited by this deal."</p>
      <p>Raninder also said he won't allow the Olympics-bound shooters to train abroad. Everyone will have to train in Delhi. "I want to keep a track of their performances sitting here. They will be allowed to travel for ammunition testing, change of grip or barrel of their gun. But for everything else, you have to train in India. We will not accept requests to train abroad with personal coaches."</p>
      <p>Raninder also had a piece of news to share. "I have spoken to 16-17 of ex Olympians of repute to mentor our shooters. It is to help them get through when facing mental meltdown. We will soon have them."</p>
