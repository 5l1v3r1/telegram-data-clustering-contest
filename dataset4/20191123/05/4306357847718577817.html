      <h3>Mark Lawrenson is backing West Ham United to deny Jose Mourinho a winning start to his Tottenham Hotspur reign at the London Stadium on Saturday afternoon.</h3>
      <p>The Portuguese manager was appointed as Mauricio Pochettino’s replacement at the Champions League runners up on Wednesday morning as Mourinho returned to management.</p>
      <p>Mourinho will take charge of Tottenham in his first Premier League game since his Manchester United side lost 3-1 to Liverpool FC at Anfield last December.</p>
      <p>The former Chelsea FC boss inherits a Tottenham side that is winless in their last five Premier League games and has only won six of their last 24 outings.</p>
      <p>Tottenham are in 14th position and 11 points adrift of fourth-placed Manchester City in the race to secure a spot in next season’s Champions League.</p>
      <p>West Ham are a point behind Spurs and Manuel Pellegrini’s side are winless in their last six Premier League fixtures to leave the London side hovering about the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>Former Liverpool FC defender Lawrenson is backing West Ham to secure a point against Tottenham at the London Stadium on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>“I think appointing Mourinho as manager is a gamble for Tottenham, I really seriously do.” Lawrenson told <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/50490801">BBC Sport</a>.</p>
      <p>“They have replaced a very popular manager with someone who, after his time at Manchester United, we are not quite sure if we have seen the best of him already.</p>
      <p>“Will it affect the way Tottenham play? Well, they probably won’t be as expansive as they were under Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>“But, whatever happens long term, on Saturday Mourinho will give them a lift straight away – he is a different voice, and gives them a fresh approach.</p>
      <p>“It is going to be interesting to see the way Spurs play, and I don’t mean just in terms of their performance against West Ham. I mean in the subtle changes that he might make, if any, to their shape and their playing style.”</p>
      <p>Tottenham finished in the top four in the last four seasons under Pochettino, something which hadn’t been achieved by any other Spurs manager in the Premier League era.</p>
