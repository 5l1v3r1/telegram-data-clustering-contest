      <p>The third annual Festival of Trees has returned to Mission Hill Family Estate Winery in West Kelowna, to benefit the BC Children's Hospital Foundation.</p>
      <p>Guests get to experience 20 different Christmas trees with the opportunity to vote on their favourite through donation.</p>
      <p>"We invite businesses from all over the community who can sponsor individual trees...Really the big part is that it's for a good cause," said Andrea Smalling vice president marketing at Mission Hill.</p>
      <p>At last years event, Mission Hill managed to raise approximately $22,000 and Smalling says they hope to raise more this year.</p>
      <p>The event is family friendly with hot chocolate, snacks, live entertainment and photos with Santa and adults can indulge in mulled wine and a sparkling lounge.</p>
      <p>"It is really an opportunity for people to come out and support an amazing operation that BC Children's Hospital has as well as enjoy some wine and food while doing it," said Smalling.</p>
      <p>Festival of Trees is on now until Jan. 4 and once the event concludes, the winner for best Christmas tree will be announced.</p>
