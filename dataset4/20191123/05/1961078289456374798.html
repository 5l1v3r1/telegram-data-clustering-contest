      <p>BOGOTÁ, Colombia — Three officers were killed in a bomb blast late Friday at a police station in southwestern Colombia as thousands gathered across the country for renewed protests of President Ivan Duque’s government.</p>
      <p>Ten officers were also injured in the explosion, which occurred in the town of Santander de Quilichao in Cauca province, a hot spot for drug trafficking, police officials said.</p>
      <p>No group took immediate responsibility for the explosion.</p>
      <p>The explosion came a day after three people were killed in Valle del Cauca province when a protest there grew violent and led to looting.</p>
      <p>Demonstrations were called across the country this week to protest government corruption and the murder of human rights activists.</p>
      <p>Thousands gathered on Friday afternoon in Bogotá, the capital, for a “cacerolazo,” a traditional Latin American expression of protest in which people bang on pots and pans.</p>
      <p>The authorities dispersed the crowd with tear gas, although some protesters regrouped to block roads and intersections.</p>
      <p>A 9 p.m. curfew is in force across most of Bogotá.</p>
      <p>Posts on social media and callers into radio stations said that people were organizing to protect homes from looters, while officials urged the public to remain calm.</p>
      <p>Mr. Duque said in a televised address on Friday night that some Colombians were taking advantage of the protests to “sow chaos.”</p>
      <p>He said he wanted to start “a national conversation” and would work to “close social gaps” and fight corruption.</p>
      <p>The Colombia protests have coincided with demonstrations elsewhere in Latin America, including anti-austerity marches in Chile; protests over vote-tampering allegations in Bolivia that led President Evo Morales to resign; and inflamed tensions in Ecuador and Nicaragua.</p>
