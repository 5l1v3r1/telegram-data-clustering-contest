      <h1>'Succession' Star Nicholas Braun on Why Shooting Greg's Congressional Testimony Was His 'Favorite Day of the Season'</h1>
      <h2>The HBO drama’s six-foot-five comic relief talks with TheWrap about Cousin Greg’s changing posture — and his new haircut</h2>

      <p>If it is to be said, watching Greg Hirsch (Nicholas Braun) fumble through his testimony before congress might’ve been the greatest moment during the second season of HBO’s “Succession.” The nonsense spewing from the mouth of the Roys’ cousin made us laugh and resulted in some amazing GIFs that were born from his attempts at using formal language.</p>
      <p>It was also a personal favorite of Braun’s, who says shooting that bit of the Season 2 finale was his “favorite day of the season.”</p>
      <p>“When [creator Jesse Armstrong] showed me that scene, I was laughing. He showed it to me the night before, it was sort of a surprise thing,” Braun told TheWrap. “We were gonna shoot it a few weeks later but he was like, ‘We could shoot it tomorrow — could you get off book?’ It was like five pages of stuff.”</p>

      <p>Braun thought to himself: “You know what? There’s something kind of amazing about the challenge here, to be able to go tomorrow and be as prepared as I can be, but it’s the same situation that Greg is being put in. He is all of a sudden being surprised with a hearing. I have to take this acting opportunity to let life imitate art and be as prepared as I can be, but also just to go be in that experience and whatever happens while we’re filming that to just let it happen.”</p>
      <p>“It was– I dunno, maybe it was my favorite day of the season just because of that,” he said. “The adrenaline that was really rushing to get this right because it’s such a– potentially great moment for Greg, it was totally, like, alive in that scene.”</p>
      <p>In case you don’t remember, here is the exact exchange between Cousin Greg and Senator Eavis. (You can also watch the cringeworthy scene via the video above.)</p>

      <p>Senator Eavis: Gregory Hirsch, executive assistant to Tom Wamsgans, correct?</p>
      <p>Greg: Yes. Yes, if it is to be said.</p>
      <p>Eavis: I’m sorry?</p>
      <p>Greg: Uh, if it is to be said, so it be, so it is.</p>
      <p>Eavis: Are you all right?</p>
      <p>Greg: Uh, yes. Uh, I merely wish to answer in the affirmative fashion.</p>
      <p>Eavis: You can speak to us normally.</p>
      <p>Greg: Oh, no — thank you, sir. Uh, uh, so I shall.</p>

      <p>OK, so that was humiliating, but at least Greg looked great while doing it! That’s because the script called for Greg to get a haircut to both look more professional in front of congress and because the character “just wanted someone to touch his head.” And that actually matched Braun’s real-life hopes for his real-life hair.</p>
      <p>“I wanted have a lot of hair [for] Season 1. It just felt like I should be overgrown and unmaintained, shaggy,” he said. “The hair just got annoying, for one. Having that much hair is an annoyance.”</p>
      <p>The six-foot-five actor — who says he purposely slumps his posture for the role — was also able to rise up a bit physically thanks to his arc this year.</p>

      <p>“It felt like, Season 2, maybe he’s starting to stand a little taller — especially towards the end,” he said. “After you sit in front of congress, it feels like you can stand a little bit taller.”</p>
      <p>Greg’s not the only tall guy on the show, as his boss (kinda?) and cousin-in-law Toms Wamgans is played by the six-foot-three Matthew Macfadyen. But their stature doesn’t seem to help them in their attempts to gain respect from the Roys.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s so interesting that the guys with the least power in this world are the tallest guys of the show,” Braun said. “We’re definitely sort of like looming around — and me more than him — but we usually have zero influence in a room.”</p>

      <p>Braun says putting himself down physically “helps [him] feel that energy [to] take on the intimidation that I think Greg feels towards the family.” “It just kind of feels right.”</p>
      <p>And the anxiety and fear you see in Greg isn’t just part of the character Braun plays, but a bit of himself thrown in.</p>
      <p>“I think people like to see me as Greg, but the truth is there’s a lot of parts about myself that I put into Greg. All that stuff about being uncomfortable and being anxious or fighting your own ambitions with fear — but feeling like maybe you’re smarter than maybe you’re showing or having a cunning side that you’re sort of afraid to let out,” he said. “All that stuff about Greg is stuff that’s inside of me, so it’s a great outlet for those things, and to in a way give myself the worst-case scenario of all those feelings that I’ve felt in my life.”</p>
