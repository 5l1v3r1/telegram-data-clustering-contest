      <h1>Comment: Patrick Cutrone’s Italian job could benefit Wolves</h1>
      <h2>In a week that saw his agent rubbish reports of a Wolves exit, Patrick Cutrone’s brief return to the land of the pizza and the pasta could be the answer to goals in gold and black.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T05:59:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 05:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/rosie-swarbrick/" target="_blank">Rosie Swarbrick</a></address>
      <p>Donato Orgnoni was left baffled by rumours of a permanent return to Italy for his client when confronted by SampNews.</p>
      <p>“We’ve never thought of leaving Wolves. I don’t understand why certain news comes out,” he said.</p>
      <p>“He remains in England one hundred per cent.”</p>
      <p>Cutrone himself has spoken of his awareness that it will take time to adapt to life in the Premier League. An adjustment and time-frame his boss Nuno Espirito Santo knows all about given his history of recruiting players from overseas.</p>
      <p>Wolves’ squad is jam-packed with Portuguese and continental players who have all adjusted to life in Wolverhampton.</p>
      <p>Adama Traore’s story is an example that should give the Italian forward hope and it seems Cutrone is following in the current wing-wizard’s footsteps.</p>
      <p>It is well known that Nuno likes his players to be versatile.</p>
      <p>We’ve seen with Traore, Leander Dendoncker, Romain Saiss and Matt Doherty that being able to adapt to a different position is key to excelling at Wolves.</p>
      <p>And, perhaps, more proof of Cutrone’s desire to stay at Molineux was his statement of intent in last weekend’s Italian job that saw him net twice in a 3-0 win over Iceland under-21s.</p>
      <p>The forward has mainly featured in an out-and-out striker role since joining from AC Milan in the summer.</p>
      <p>He had played on the wing at times for the Italian giants and his return to goal-scoring form coincided with a return to a left-wing role for the U21 side.</p>
      <p>If Cutrone had a say in that shift then he must be applauded for his intelligence.</p>
      <p>The move did not just give him goals but now gives Nuno more options up front.</p>
      <p>With a shift away from 3-5-2 in recent weeks Cutrone has been battling it out with Raul Jimenez for the central striker role of a front three.</p>
      <p>But with Jimenez already on 13 goals in all competitions for Wolves this season – just four off last term’s tally – there will be no usurping him anytime soon. The Mexican maintained his goal standard with two for his country on international duty too.</p>
      <p>And despite a mammoth journey back from Mexico, with modern recovery protocol and Wolves’ supreme sports science department on the case, the in-form forward will no doubt be raring to go at Bournemouth today.</p>
      <p>It seems from a footballing point of view, if not psychological standpoint, a whiff of the Italian air has done Cutrone the world of good.</p>
      <p>And with Jimenez’s jet-setting bound to have an impact at some point, Traore and Diogo Jota both having injury issues thus far this term, there will be a chance for Cutrone to build on just two goals from 19 appearances.</p>
