      <p>Huddersfield Town boss Danny Cowley has pointed out what he believes to be <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a>'s biggest threat.</p>
      <p>Blues head to Yorkshire to take on the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/huddersfield-town-fc">Terriers</a> on Saturday afternoon, and the home team are looking to bounce back from their first defeat in eight games.</p>
      <p>Huddersfield slipped up against high-flyers Preston before the international break, and they will have to be on their guard against City to ensure they don't suffer back-to-back defeats for the first time since September.</p>
      <p>That's according to manager Danny Cowley, who said in his <a href="https://www.htafc.com/news/2019/november/danny-cowley-provides-injury-update/">pre-match press conference:</a> "I think it will be a really tough game.</p>

      <p>"I think you’ll find a team that have got the option to go quite quickly to Jutkiewicz, who is a point of reference for them.</p>
      <p>“Physically he is really tough for centre-halves to handle but also they’ve got some really technical midfield players.</p>
      <p>“They like to roll their wide players in and like to overload you in other areas. They’ve got some really technical players that can unlock even organised compact defences and they’ve got some full-backs that are particularly athletic on the overlap.</p>
      <p>“We understand the complexity of the challenge in front of us, I think it’s going to be a really tough game, but we’re back home and we’ve worked really hard these last two weeks.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think there will have been another Championship team who worked as hard as we have this international break. We feel fit and strong at this moment.”</p>
