      <p><b>Bongaigaon</b><b>:</b> Bongaigaon Refinery, in association with district administration, Chirang, conducted a full-scale Offsite Disaster Mock Drill on Thursday at 1:00 pm in compliance to the statutory requirements. The simulated scenario for the mock drill was that after loading of LPG from BGR, one LPG tank truck (TT) was moving towards Chapaguri through service road beside NH-31C. At the same time, one RPC truck was coming out from BGR PSF gate after completion of loading. While coming out from PSF gate, the RPC truck hit the loaded LPG TT in the service road in front of PSF gate. LPG started gushing out due to crack in the loading connection. LPG vapour cloud formed and travelled inside BGR as per prevailing wind direction and got ignited due to nearby gas cutting job using DA cylinder. The DA cylinder got ignited inside the refinery aa a result of which fire took place in LPG TT and surrounding area outside the refinery boundary leading to off-site disaster.</p>
      <p>Immediately, information regarding the emergency situation was passed to the chief district emergency coordinator, DC, Chirang by the unit head, BGR and after assessing the grave situation, the chief district emergency coordinator advised BGR to declare it as an offsite disaster. In addition to BGR disaster control coordinators, off site disaster control coordinators of district administration, namely Fire Services, Police, Medical &amp; Health Services, Food &amp; Civil Supplies, Transport, Public Health Engineering, etc., participated in the mock drill. With the concerted efforts of team BGR and district disaster control team, the emergency was brought under control and the situation became normal.</p>
      <p>Subsequent to the disaster drill, a debriefing session was conducted in the Crisis Control Room at DC Office, Chirang, in presence of Karmadev Brahma, ADC, Chirang and other key officials of district administration and Amarendra Kalita, Chief General Manager (in-charge), BGR and other senior officials of Bongaigaon Refinery. The team work and efficiency shown in the drill was well appreciated by the house.</p>
