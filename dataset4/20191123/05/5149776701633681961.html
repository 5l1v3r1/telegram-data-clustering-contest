      <p>A nurse of 20 years has achieved a long-term dream to open her own tea room with vintage crockery, bunting and delicious home-made cakes.</p>
      <p>Alice's Tea Shop - named after owner Allison Morris' late grandmother - has already proved popular with villagers since opening this week.</p>
      <p>The traditional menu covers breakfast, light lunches, cakes, coffee - and obviously tea, either a pot of Yorkshire tea or one of the loose leaf teas, from English breakfast and Earl Grey to peppermint and spicy chai.</p>
      <p>After taking over an empty property, which had been the Village Cafe and Bistro in Keyworth until its closure in June, Allison and her landscaper husband Steve gave it a full vintage makeover with pastel colours, birds and flowers wallpaper, bunting, wooden dressers and upcycled tables and chairs.</p>

      <p>Lunches of soup, toasted sandwiches, paninis, sandwiches and jacket potatoes are served. The array of cakes, currently lemon with lavender, Victoria sponge, and carrot, will always have vegan and gluten-free options.</p>
      <p>Toasted tea cakes, cream teas, cheese scones and seasonal treats, including mince pies and chocolate log are also there to tempt customers who have just popped in for a coffee.</p>
      <p>And what's a tea room without <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/go-festive-afternoon-tea-nottingham-3525019">afternoon tea</a>? Here the pre-bookable feast comes with sandwiches with fillings such as smoked salmon and ham, scones with Mr Pitchfork's strawberry and champagne jam and clotted cream, and a selection of cake - with an abundance of tea or glass of fizz.</p>

      <p>Allison, who lives in Wymeswold, had been a practice nurse in West Bridgford but quit to look after her sick father. She said the untimely deaths of her grandmother Alice and mother Barbara prompted her to take a leap of faith to live her dream.</p>
      <p>"I decided to give up nursing and try something else. This is something I have always wanted to do. I love tea shops, the vintage feel, the crockery and tea pots.</p>

      <p>"My grandmother died when I was young but I remember her fondly so I named it after her. I lost my mum Barbara suddenly when I was very young. She was only in her forties so I thought if I don't do it now, you never know what's around the corner.</p>
      <p>"I lost my dad a few years ago. I think they would be very proud of me."</p>
      <p>Allison hopes the tea room in Main Street will have all the perfect ingredients so that customers leave happy. She said: "I have been to so many that are not that nice and thought I can do that. There should be good customer service, that welcoming feel and a nice selection of local food."</p>

      <p>Bacon and sausage comes from RM &amp; J. Green butcher's shop a few doors away, home-produced honey is from Willoughby, Mr Pitchfork's Pickles is based in Nottingham, while produce is sourced from Kerry's Fresh in Cotgrave.</p>
      <p>"It is important we keep it as local as possible, We very much want to reduce the plastic and keep that to a minimum," said Allison, whose husband is helping to get the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/nottingham-cafe-provide-free-christmas-3561312">cafe</a> off the ground before returning to his landscaping business.</p>
      <p>The 22-seater tea shop, which has created three jobs including one for her long-time friend Hannah Hallett, had a busy first day.</p>

      <p>"We keep asking for feedback. People can give us an honest opinion because I have never done it before," said Allison.</p>
      <p>"We were asked about takeaway a few times yesterday so that is something we need to think about. People were taking cake home and some people have come in for <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/cafe-closure-blamed-parking-enforcement-3536442">breakfast</a> cobs to take away today</p>
      <p>"It's very changeable if there is something people would like."</p>
      <p>
        <i>Alice's Tea Shop is open Monday to Friday from 8am to 3.30pm and Saturdays 8am to 2pm.</i>
