      <h1>Birmingham city centre parking space you can use for 95 YEARS - but it costs £50k</h1>
      <h2>It's yours for nearly a century - but it costs more than some houses</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T05:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author">Kamal Sultan</a></address>
      <p>It's one of the bugbears of modern city centre life - cruising the streets at slow speed looking for that elusive empty parking space.</p>
      <p>But salvation could be at hand with a solution that means one driver will never have to worry about finding a vacant spot in central Birmingham ever again.</p>
      <p>There's just one catch - it will cost a bit more than the loose change most drivers have rattling around in the glovebox.</p>
      <p>Almost £50,000 to be precise - and that's more than some houses currently on the market.</p>
      <p>Because the space up for grabs at Millennium apartments in Newhall Street is on the market at £49,950 - more than some houses on the market in the city.</p>
      <p>In contrast, a three-bedroom terrace in Dunstall Grove, Selly Oak, is going under the hammer at auction on December 11 with a <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/property/cheap-terrace-house-selly-oak-17218978">guide price of just £5,000</a>.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>So what will the buyer get for all that cash?</p>
      <p>Exclusive use of space number 74 and a short walk from Snow Hill and New Street stations.</p>
      <p>It is guarded by CCTV and there's apartment block concierge at hand to assist with any problems.</p>
      <p>A gated secure entrance provides extra security for the - presumably - high-end car parked in the space and the belongings inside.</p>

      <p>The 125-year lease began on March 1, 1988 and has 95 years remaining.</p>
      <p>That works out to be £1.44 per day for the remainder of the lease.</p>
      <p>Parking around the city centre would usually set you back around £3 for two hours.</p>

        <figcaption>It’s a leasehold ownership which means you will have a lease for the parking space for another 95 years which works out to be £1.44 per day. (Image: Purple Frog)</figcaption>

      <p>The new owner will, however, have to pay £50-a-year for ground rent.</p>
      <p>The ad on Rightmove stresses no apartment comes with the space but describes it as an “extremely rare opportunity with excellent access to the city area”.</p>
