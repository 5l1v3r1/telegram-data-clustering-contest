      <p>Survivor Series is only days away and the excitement is quite palpable. I'm certain that I wasn't the only one who popped when Triple H, Shawn Michaels, and Road Dogg led Team NXT, DX style to invade the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/smackdown">SmackDown</a> roster.</p>
      <p>That said, while the pieces are all in place for a great pay-per-view event, I do honestly believe that there is also the possibility of things going awfully wrong as well. I am a mere writer while <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/vince-mcmahon">Vince McMahon</a> is a multi-billionaire at the very top of his game, but as someone who's followed his product for over two decades now, I will suggest a small checklist so that the show goes off with no glitch.</p>
      <p>As always, I invite you to weigh in and leave a comment with regard to whether or not, you'd want one or more of these things to potentially take place. Even if you disagree with my assessment, you are welcome to voice your opinions, folks!</p>
      <p>Also, please leave a comment as to whether or not you enjoyed this week's episode of SmackDown by rating the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">matches here</a>.</p>

      <p>I say this as a fan of Mr. Daniel Bryan. I do believe that he's the greatest wrestler in the world at the moment and that he can make anyone that he works with look very good as well. Unfortunately, I do not think that it is his time to be the next WWE Universal Champion right now.</p>
      <p>The Fiend is the hottest thing in the business at the moment and he should hold on to the blue strap at least all the way until WrestleMania 36. For Daniel Bryan to defeat The Fiend would just take away all of the momentum that the man has accrued over the past few weeks!</p>
