      <p><b>Miley Cyrus</b> has not been secretly “shipped off” to rehab, despite a false tabloid report. There’s zero truth to the story. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can debunk it.</p>
      <p>The <i><b>Globe</b></i> is reporting this week that Cyrus has been forced to seek help after a wild summer that include a split from Liam Hemsworth and subsequent romances. The tabloid quotes a so-called “insider” as saying, “Miley’s loved ones staged an intervention. She’s been off the rails now for so long, and something very serious had to be done because Miley’s spiraling into dangerous territory with all this crazy behavior.” The supposed insider goes on to allege that the singer’s recent throat surgery is the perfect cover “for her to drop out of sight and work on her issues and addiction problems.”</p>
      <p>Cyrus did undergo vocal cord surgery after an undisclosed condition was discovered as she underwent a tonsillectomy last month. The surgery also follows a busy summer for Cyrus, who repeatedly made headlines for her personal life. First, it came out that she and her Hemsworth were divorcing after eight months of marriage. The pop star then had a brief fling with Kaitlynn Carter before she started a whirlwind romance with Australian singer Cody Simpson.</p>
      <p>Amid all of that though, there’s no evidence she has been “off the rails” and “totally burnt out,” as the tabloid’s dubious source implies. <b>Gossip Cop</b> check with an individual in the singer’s camp, who tells us the report is completely untrue. It was also revealed in an article by <i>People</i> magazine that <a href="https://people.com/music/miley-cyrus-cody-simpson-easy-relationship/">Simpson visited Cyrus at her home in Tennessee</a>, where she is recovering.</p>
      <p>The truth is, Cyrus’ surgery requires her to remain silent for weeks as part of the recovery, and she’s taken a break from social media. She’s not in rehab and the idea that she would be sent to a facility while recovering from a major throat surgery is illogical. Earlier this week, the <i>Globe’s</i> sister publication, the <i>National Enquirer</i>, falsely claimed <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/miley-cyrus-sing-again-vocal-cord-surgery/">Cyrus would never sing again after the surgery</a>. <b>Gossip Cop</b> also debunked that story. The pop star is on the mend and is expected to make a full recovery in the next couple of months or so.</p>
      <p>The <i>Globe</i> also has a sketchy history when it comes to Cyrus. Eariler this month, the tabloid alleged <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/miley-cyrus-pot-businesses-investing-millions/">Cyrus was investing “tens of millions” into the pot business</a>. While it’s true the singer has been investing in a cannabis cafe, she’s not pouring millions into the marijuana industry. This latest report about a secret stint in rehab is more fiction.</p>
