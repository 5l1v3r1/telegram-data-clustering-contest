      <p>He similarly urged Tanzanians to work hard to improve incomes. “In the matter of improving personal economy, everyone has to engage in income generating activities,” he stated.</p>
      <p>He urged farmers to utilize ongoing rains to plant early for better harvests.</p>
      <p>On his part, the Minister of State, President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Governments) Selemani Jafo said that so far a number of development projects have been implemented in the capital city, boosting its status and improving people’s incomes.</p>
