      <p>When your employees <a href="https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/5-ways-youre-contributing-to-a-toxic-culture-without-realizing-it.html?cid=search">perceive you to be a toxic boss</a>, the result is a <a href="https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/8-easy-to-miss-signs-your-workplace-is-toxic.html?cid=search">toxic </a><a href="https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/8-easy-to-miss-signs-your-workplace-is-toxic.html?cid=search">work environment</a>. That's harmful to your business, its entire workforce, and to you as well. So it's absolutely in your own best interest to curtail your <a href="https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/these-5-toxic-factors-cause-people-to-quit-even-before-they-have-another-job-according-to-a-recent-study.html">toxic ways</a>. </p>
      <p>Here's exactly how to do that. </p>
      <h3>Know What Makes a Boss "Toxic" </h3>
      <p>Being considered a "toxic boss" isn't just about being assertive or having a singular focus on your company. <a href="http://www.inc.com/john-boitnott/these-7-signs-will-tell-you-if-your-workplace-is-toxic.html">Toxic people</a><a href="http://www.inc.com/john-boitnott/these-7-signs-will-tell-you-if-your-workplace-is-toxic.html"> </a>exhibit specific bad behaviors that employees recognize as challenging, offensive or even harmful to the accurate and efficient completion of their job tasks. </p>
      <p>Examples of toxic behavior include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Frequent emotional, <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-boitnott/4-tips-for-calmly-handling-an-angry-co-worker.html">angry outbursts</a>, venting </li>
        <li>Yelling and other raised-voice communications</li>
        <li>"Blowing up," or overreactions to specific mixups or mistakes</li>
        <li>Gossiping</li>
        <li>Arbitrary rule enforcement or discipline</li>
        <li>Playing "favorites" among employees, especially when it's based on traits other than job performance</li>
        <li>Aggressive verbal and gestural communication habits, including rude gestures, eye-rolling, audible sighs or interruptions while others are speaking</li>
        <li>Micromanaging, instead of truly assigning and delegating projects to employees and managers</li>
        <li>Emotional manipulation of employees and others in order to gain and exercise greater control over them</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Try to observe your own behavior over the course of several weeks in an attempt to pinpoint specific issues you need to address. Enlist the aid of a trusted colleague for additional perspective. </p>
      <h3>Get Clear on the Consequences</h3>
      <p>Toxic bosses negatively impact the health, well-being and productivity of their employees. They also chase off workers at all levels. And after a few years of <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-boitnott/use-these-5-effective-strategies-to-keep-employees-happy-long-term.html">high turnover</a>, you can only imagine what your toxic ways might do to your company's reputation, bottom line, and its ability to attract and hire top talent. </p>
      <p>You'll potentially expose your company to substantial legal liability in the event that a former employee sues over your toxic behavior. If that worker offers sufficient proof (including supporting testimony of coworkers, for example), you can find yourself on the hook for financial damages, as well.</p>
      <h3>Listen to Your Employees </h3>
      <p>By "listen" I don't simply mean "listen as they speak" (though that's important too). I mean pay attention to their behavior, both when they're aware of your presence and when they're not. </p>
      <p>I can recall one colleague of mine who learned his leadership was viewed as toxic, before he worked on changing. He observed workers stiffen up and adopt different ways of speaking (they became more formal or more halting). If you notice team members become noticeably more tense around you, it could indicate you're putting them off in some way. </p>
      <p>A certain amount of nervousness or a bit of heightened formality around the boss is fine. But if people can't relax around you, then you might want to look deeper. Assume there's a problem, even if it's only one of perception, and work to change that. </p>
      <h3>Develop Some Empathy</h3>
      <p>Show you are listening to your employees' concerns and that you empathize with them. </p>
      <p>That doesn't mean you must always agree with them or defer to their judgment. It simply means you demonstrate your willingness to see a situation or problem from their perspective and that you understand their needs, wants and fears. It shows your workers that you value them as human beings enough to take their concerns seriously. </p>
      <p>This kind of empathy will help you create a more productive and healthy working environment. </p>
      <h3>Recommit Yourself to Ethical Behavior</h3>
      <p>Most CEOs and entrepreneurs would at least give lip service to the idea of conducting themselves with integrity at all times and in all things. Go beyond mere words. Make a fresh commitment to yourself and your company to walk in integrity as a boss and business owner. </p>
      <p>Ethical behavior is no longer something most employees (or most customers, for that matter) are willing to let you slide on, no matter how awesome your product or company may be in other respects. </p>
      <p>Align yourself with the kind of leadership values that turn workers into loyal teammates and customers into brand ambassadors. When you recommit to those high personal expectations for your own behavior, you'll find yourself naturally eschewing toxic behaviors.</p>
      <h3>Get Help</h3>
      <p>Above all, don't hesitate to seek outside help. </p>
      <p>Counseling and anger management courses can help you get a handle on outsized or negative emotional responses. When you work on this with an open mind and heart, you'll gain valuable tools and resources to get a better handle on <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-boitnott/why-being-a-tough-boss-doesnt-make-you-a-good-boss-and-how-to-change.html">toxic behaviors</a> before they gain a foothold in your company's work environment.</p>
