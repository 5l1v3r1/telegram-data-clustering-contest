      <p>Commenting on Chiwenga's arrival Professor Jonathan Moyo said, "General Chiwenga is back and looking fit. He was received at RGM Airport in Harare early this morning by Chinese Deputy Ambassador, Zhao Baogang. While Zimpapers were on duty to capture the arrival, no government or ZanuPF officials were seen save for Chiwenga's relatives and security!"</p>
