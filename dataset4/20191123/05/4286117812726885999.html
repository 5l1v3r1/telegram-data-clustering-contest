      <p>Even though Devendra Fadnavis took the chief minister's oath Saturday morning with NCP's Ajit Pawar as his deputy, the month-long political drama in Maharashtra is far from over. The Congress, Shiv Sena and even the NCP have accused Ajit Pawar of betraying his party MLAs by "misusing" their letter of support.</p>
      <p>The Congress has alleged Ajit Pawar extended support to the BJP without discussing it with NCP president Sharad Pawar.</p>
      <p>Congress spokesperson Raju Waghmare said, "Ajit Pawar is CLP leader of the NCP. The letter of support by MLAs was with him. He misused those letters to show it to the governor. It will be a mighty task for the BJP to prove majority on the floor of the House."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, sources have confirmed to India Today TV that the letter of support signed by NCP MLAs was with Ajit Pawar.</p>
      <p>The space where the chief minister's name was to be added was left blank because the NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena had yet not come to a final agreement. The letter also had a blank space where name of the party to whom the NCP would pledge support to was left blank to be filled after a final agreement.</p>
      <p>Sources say Ajit Pawar used this letter to extend support to the BJP by filling the blank spaces in favour of the party.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters, NCP MLA Nawab Malik also accused Ajit Pawar of "misusing" the letter of support signed by NCP MLAs.</p>
      <p>Maharashtra woke up to a topsy turvy Saturday morning with the political scene having transformed completely. Until Friday night, the NCP, Congress and the Shiv Sena were all set to join hands to form the next government with Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray as the chief minister and the Congress and NCP getting a deputy chief minister each.</p>
      <p>But on Saturday, the BJP pulled up a big surprise by roping in NCP's Ajit Pawar and making him the deputy chief minister in exchange of his support to the BJP. Before the Shiv Sena, Congress and Ajit Pawar's uncle Sharad Pawar could understand the fast-paced developments, BJP's Devendra Fadnavis took oath as Maharashtra's chief minister for the second term.</p>
