      <p><b>PHILADELPHIA (AP)</b> - Philadelphia coach Brett Brown met Gregg Popovich at midcourt, gave him a handshake, hug and pat on the back.</p>
      <p>Brown knows all about long losing streaks, and Popovich helped him get through them. Now, it's Brown's turn to help.</p>
      <p>Tobias Harris scored 26 points, Joel Embiid had 21 points and 14 rebounds, and the Philadelphia 76ers beat San Antonio 115-104 on Friday night to hand the Spurs their eighth straight defeat.</p>
      <p>The skid is the Spurs' worst under longtime coach Popovich.</p>
      <p>"Figured it was something like that," Popovich said.</p>
      <p>A former Spurs assistant under Popovich, Brown endured an NBA-record 28-game losing streak during Philadelphia's rebuilding project early in his tenure.</p>
      <p>Usually loquacious, Brown didn't have much to say about sending his mentor to the longest skid of his career.</p>
      <p>"I love him. He knows that," Brown said. "He coaches hard, he moves on."</p>
      <p>Ben Simmons had a triple-double with 10 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds for the 76ers, who improved to 6-0 at home.</p>
      <p>DeMar DeRozan had 29 points and Rudy Gay scored 22 for the Spurs.</p>
      <p>"I thought the effort was good, just a bad start again," Popovich said. "We're just trying to not make as many mistakes, mostly at the defensive end because it always puts us in a bad way. We're working at it."</p>
      <p>DeRozan said Popovich has remained positive despite the losing streak.</p>
      <p>"He's extremely optimistic, doesn't panic," DeRozan said. "He keeps our spirits up high, keeps our confidence up high. Got to keep our heads up."</p>
      <p>San Antonio last dropped eight in a row in November 1996 under coach Bob Hill. Popovich was the team's general manager at the time. He fired Hill later that season and began his long run of success.</p>
      <p>In his 24th season, Popovich has won five NBA titles and gone to the playoffs in 22 straight seasons while compiling a winning record in each of those 22 campaigns. He has spent just 74 days with a losing record over the last 22 seasons.</p>
      <p>Prior to the recent slump, Popovich hadn't lost seven consecutive games since Feb. 23 to March 5, 1997.</p>
      <p>"He felt sorry for me in my early years," Brown said. "He's amazing. His competitiveness is incredibly admirable. Nothing I respect more that Pop has achieved than longevity."</p>
      <p>Popovich said the sting of losing was slightly lessened due to the opponent.</p>
      <p>"If you lose to (Brown), for some strange reason it doesn't hurt quite as bad," he said. "You're a little bit happy for him - just a little."</p>
      <p>San Antonio trailed most of the way but got within one late in the third quarter before the 76ers pulled away in the fourth.</p>
      <p>It was 101-95 with just under six minutes left when Popovich elected to intentionally foul Simmons for the second straight trip down court. A 58% free throw shooter, Simmons missed both attempts the first time but drained both shots on his subsequent trip to the line to put Philadelphia ahead 103-95 with 5:34 remaining.</p>
      <p>Furkan Korkmaz hit a 3-pointer from the corner on Philadelphia's next possession and then Harris made a layup to put the 76ers comfortably ahead, 108-97, with 4:24 left.</p>
      <p>BROWN BACKER</p>
      <p>The pressure has intensified on Brown after the team's early playoff exits the last two seasons and a so-so start to 2019-20. Brown acknowledged as much before the game, saying his job "has been in question since the day I took it."</p>
      <p>However, Popovich doesn't believe Brown should be receiving scrutiny. Brown spent 11 seasons with the Spurs.</p>
      <p>"Fans don't know (anything)," Popovich said. "He's one hell of a guy and the most positive guy I've ever known. He's going to work his (butt) off. They are lucky to have him."</p>
