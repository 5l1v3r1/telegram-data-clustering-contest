    <meta property="og:description" content="In a Facebook post sighted by MyNewsGh.com Ghanaian radio presenter, Mike Two has asked Okyeame Kwame to apologize to Ghanaians. Mike Two called on the musician to apologize to Ghanaians and patrons of the event on his failure to wear a made in Ghana dress while commending others who wore made in Ghana dresses. He wrote: ” Okyeame Kwame really disappointed me and some patrons of 4sytetv award last Saturday for commending patrons wearing made in Ghana while he being tourism ambassador was in foreign suit…I think it was a big indictment on his part which he should apologize.. Yes I am not saying he should not wear foreign dress at all but being in such dress and commending people in made in Ghana was something ‘ I can’t tink far’ “. According to Mike Two Okyeame Kwame as the Made in Ghana Ambassador, he should have dedicated himself to making sure this object is fully realized. Not long ago, the Ministry of Trade &amp; Industry named Okyeame Kwame as the ambassador of its made-in-Ghana (MIG) campaign."/>
