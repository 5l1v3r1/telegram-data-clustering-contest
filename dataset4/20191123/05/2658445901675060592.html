      <p>The Lagos State government has urged intending pilgrims to Israel to shun acts capable of giving the state a bad image.</p>
      <p>The Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Mrs Adebunmi Adekanye, gave the advice at the service of dedication for November pilgrims held at the Chapel of Christ The Light, Alausa, Ikeja.</p>
      <p>Adekanye, who represented the Commissioner for Home Affairs, Uzamat Akinbile-Yussuf, urged the pilgrims to consider the trip a spiritual gathering.</p>

      <p>“We advise you to comport yourself as good ambassadors of the Christendom and Lagos State. I advise everybody to shun any intention to abscond; we should all go for the purpose for which we are sent and come back to continue our life in a better way.</p>
      <p>”We have been in preparation for this for some time now; we have done medical and administrative screening and we are ready to go.</p>
      <p>“This service of dedication is themed ‘In His Presence’ because we believe we are going to the Lord’s presence to intercede for our country, families and we believe that we shall come back full of testimonies,”Akinbile-Yussuf said.</p>
