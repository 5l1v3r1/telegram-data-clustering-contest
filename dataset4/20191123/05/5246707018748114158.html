      <p>Yusuke Ohmura might not necessarily be a household name like Shigeru Miyamoto or Junichi Masuda, but he's definitely made some significant contributions to the Pokémon video game series over the years.</p>
      <p>This <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Yusuke_Ohmura">former</a> Game Freak illustrator started out on <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_diamond_and_pearl"><b>Pokémon Diamond &amp; Pearl</b></a> and contributed to various other mainline entries right up until <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_x_and_y"><b>Pokémon X &amp; Y</b></a> and the release of <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_sun_and_moon">Sun and Moon</a></b> on the Nintendo 3DS. During this period he drew Pokémon designs, characters and even the Gym leaders in the series.</p>
      <p>In 2016, Mr. Ohmura left Game Freak to become a freelance illustrator. Despite moving on, he's now taken to Twitter to reveal he actually helped Game Freak out with the latest entries <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></b> on Switch – designing the new legendary pocket monsters Zacian and Zamazenta, along with one of the protagonist's rivals in the game, Marnie.</p>
