      <h2>Why does everybody keep calling me a duck?</h2>

      <p>Burton is a fantastic, unique and, often, obscure place to live.</p>
      <p>Since moving to the town, there <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/burton">have been many phrases</a>, words and places that have utterly boggled my mind.</p>
      <p>When I question my colleagues on their meanings - or my mispronunciations - I am met with pitiful looks that say "one day he'll learn".</p>
      <p>Ranging from the age-old question of what you truly call a bun - is it a roll or is it a bap? - <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids/">to why people</a> are telling me they have "got a cob on", there are a whole manner of things that still confuse me even to this day.</p>
      <p>Here are just a few instances where I have been left wondering whether I have suddenly been transported to a faraway land.</p>

      <h3>Quirky things about Burton</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>What do you call a bun?</h4>
          <figure>

          <p>Since moving to the town I must have heard four or five names for the breaded thing you use to house various meats and sandwiches.</p>
          <p>Whether it be a bun, bap, roll, cob or even a bread cake - there seems to be far too many options.</p>
        </li>

          <h4>Winshill, Stapenhill, Newhall ...</h4>
          <figure>

          <p>I recall getting a very odd look from a bus driver when I got on one and asked for a return ticket to Newhall - pronouncing it "New Hall" in the process.</p>
          <p>That feeling of shame and horror at the expression on <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/traffic-and-travel">that bus driver's face</a> will stay will me until the end of my days. It will certainly not be a mistake I will repeat in the future.</p>
          <p>Winshill and Stapenhill also fall into this same category, with both pronunciations being corrected to me on my first couple of weeks on the job.</p>
          <p>Note to self - do not pronounce the "h" under any circumstances.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Splash on your sandwich?</h4>
          <p>My mind was sent racing when ordering a bacon sandwich one day. I was asked whether I would like a "splash" with it.</p>
          <p>"Are you about to throw my sandwich in the Trent?", I thought. Is there a special sauce that nobody has warned we about? What could this 'splash' be?"</p>
          <p>Luckily, I soon learned that it was actually just a little dab of tinned tomatoes on the bap (or should that be cob? Or roll?).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>I am not a duck</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article1507668.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/BP_BDM_270418ReptonDuckDerby_02.jpg"/>

          <p>Many different words and phrases are used in the area that leave a puzzled, blank look on my face whenever they are uttered.</p>
          <p>None more so have taken as much getting used to as being called a "duck" at least 43 times a day.</p>
          <p>That includes being greeted on the bus to a warm "ey up me duck" or being told "cheers me duck" when paying in a shop.</p>
          <p>Last time I checked I did not have a feathered bottom and a bill, but I must admit I do love it - it's warm and welcoming.</p>

          <h4>Council pop</h4>
          <p>Staying on the topic of food and drink, when offering someone a drink once, I was met with the strange request for "council pop".</p>
          <p>Despite racking my brain for what <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink/">brand of fizzy drink</a> or beverage to pour my guest, I was soon put out of my misery.</p>
          <p>It turns out "council pop" is simply just water, with the renaming very similar to the "corporation pop" that I know it to be called.</p>
        </li>

          <h4>Pair of odd statues</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://i2-prod.staffordshire-live.co.uk/incoming/article2790948.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_BWR_TEM_240419_MaltShovelBurton.jpg"/>

          <p>The Shovel in Burton is a bit of a strange one.</p>
          <p>You walk round the corner of Union Street, onto High Street, and come face to face with a strangely massive shovel with a print of a beer bottle cut out of it.</p>
          <p>After some research I found out that the 30ft stainless steel malt shovel sculpture had stood on the junction of the street since 2001.</p>
          <p>It was funded by a <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/your-money">Â£45,000 National Lottery grant</a>, with designers at the time saying it represented Burton's brewing past, paying homage to the malt shovels used by brewery workers.</p>
          <p>In the same vein, a large concrete jar of Marmite can be seen on the Washlands, near Burton Library, clearly celebrating the salty spread's link to the town.</p>

          <h4>What do you say when you are grumpy</h4>
          <p>From where I am from in Worcestershire, if you are unhappy, you are simply moody, grumpy or just a bit bothered.</p>
          <p>However, there seems to be all manner of phrases in these parts for letting others know you are not too pleased with them.</p>
          <p>"Gob a cob on", "got a monk on" and "got a bag on" have all been thrown around - many in my direction, unfortunately.</p>
