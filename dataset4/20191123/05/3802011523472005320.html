      <p>The current owner, Meikles Limited, has over the past few years struggled with low occupancy levels and has lacked foreign exchange to refurbish the property in Harare.</p>
      <p>Albwardy said the investment had been approved by Zimbabwe’s stock exchange and competition commission, while the shareholders would vote on the transaction next month.</p>

      <p>Albwardy is expected to spend up to $30 million in upgrading the hotel, an official from Meikles Hotel told Reuters. The hotel, which was established in 1915, has 312 rooms. <a href="https://af.reuters.com/article/zimbabweNews/idAFL8N2821EX"><b>Reuters</b></a></p>
