      <h3>TA Playlist Game for December 2019 Announced</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Mark+Delaney">Mark Delaney</a>, 23 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>With another week of voting behind us, we've got our next <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/TAPlaylist">TA Playlist</a> game settled. But it may not be our last after all. First, let's get to the game. Join us this December as we end 2019 with the bang of a Winchester Repeater. It's time for <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Red-Dead-Redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>.</p>

      <p>RDR2 tells the story of the Dutch van der Linde gang in the dying west. With a massive cast of outlaws, the 60+ hour story chronicles their efforts to stay afloat in a world where the old guard of lawlessness is being suffocated by encroaching lawmen and a new regime of federal power players. It won the 2018 TA Game of the Year award in a sea of many more.</p>
      <p>In fact, Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the highest-rated games of all-time, with an OpenCritic score of 96. It split virtually all the Game of the Year awards in 2019 with PS4's God of War and is considered by many to be Rockstar's finest effort in a catalog of generational efforts.</p>

      <p>The full completion will take a long time, over 200 hours by our community's estimates. It's not in Game Pass, but it is on sale right now for Black Friday, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/Red-Dead-Redemption-2/BPSWGQBW7R3G">you can get it for half off</a>. We hope you'll join us for December's TA Playlist by offering achievement help, playing Red Dead Online with others in the club, and discussing some of the game's most spoiler-filled moments.</p>
      <h4>Will TA Playlist Continue?</h4>
      <p>As many of you saw last week, December's TA Playlist was intended to be the final month of the event. I received a lot of touching comments on this news from our many players, and even those who were upset about it managed to reach out politely — a huge win for internet everywhere — and today I come with some good news.</p>
      <p>If you missed it, I'm stepping down from my monthly Playlist hosting as the rest of my life has gotten too busy to allow me to continue. However, I've been in touch with many fans about ways to keep it going and we have a few ideas.</p>
      <p><b>The best-case scenario is this</b>: TA Playlist may continue exactly as you know it, with new hosts running the polls and organizing the club each and every month. This right now seems like it has a strong chance of happening, but I can't confirm it just yet.</p>
      <p><b>The worst-case scenario is this (and it's still pretty good)</b>: TA Playlist will, like all of us one day, be replaced by automation. Polls and front page reminders will disappear as they are the human legwork needed, and in absence of the above scenario, won't be fulfilled.</p>
      <p>BUT!</p>
      <p>If this is the case, Playlist games can be pre-scheduled for each month of 2020 and beyond, including past vote-getters as well as new games you'd like to recommend. That means each month there would be a TA Playlist game, which you'll always find in the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/TAPlaylist">TA Playlist Hub</a> even if it's automated. You'll still get credit for your badge, the forums will still be there, and we'll still highlight only games that feel like they have the right Playlist flavor. We just won't be voting for them each month — admittedly, this is one of my favorite parts.</p>
      <p>I'm hoping to announce the concrete plans soon, once I get a hold of the new triumvirate seeking to lord over the TA Playlist kingdom. As soon as I know their final plans, we'll say more.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, you should totally recommend which games you want to see added to TA Playlist over in the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/forum/viewthread.aspx?tid=929758">Game Suggestion Thread</a>. We've used countless suggestions from that space over the years, and new suggestions continue to flow in.</p>
      <p>Whether the next iteration of the community event looks seamlessly as it has before or it looks somewhat different, TA Playlist, including badges and forums (and maybe more) <b>will continue</b>. I'm excited to fulfill this wish so many of you have, and it's nice to see the event means a lot to you as it always has to me. Rumors of TA Playlist's demise have been greatly exaggerated — <i>my bad</i>.</p>
      <p>I'll see you in the wild west.</p>
