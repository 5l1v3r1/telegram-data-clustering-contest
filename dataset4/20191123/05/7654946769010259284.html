      <h1>What Bobby Hurley thinks of St. John’s coaching hire</h1>

      <p>The man who <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/04/11/bobby-hurley-out-of-st-johns-hunt-tim-cluess-still-in-forefront/">passed on the job</a> thinks St. John’s got it right.</p>
      <p>The Johnnies’ first five games under Mike Anderson, four one-sided victories and a narrow loss to mid-major power Vermont, back up his belief.</p>
      <p>“I think his style of coaching fits in terms of wanting to play up-tempo, wanting to play fast, wanting to put points on the board, being aggressive,” Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley told The Post in a phone interview, as he prepared to face St. John’s for the third time in as many years Saturday afternoon at Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Conn. “That’s what a lot of New York City basketball is about.”</p>
      <p>Hurley was the leading candidate to replace Chris Mullin after the Hall of Fame player and the school parted ways following four mostly disappointing seasons. But Hurley, the Jersey City native and two-time national champion as a player at Duke, opted to remain at Arizona State, which he has led to back-to-back NCAA Tournament bids in four seasons there. When he declined the job, St. John’s expanded its search, looking at a number of candidates, before finding Anderson, who had been fired by Arkansas after eight seasons and three NCAA Tournament berths.</p>
      <p>Now, interestingly, the two will meet in the Hall of Fame Tip-Off Tournament, with the winner likely drawing defending national champion and seventh-ranked Virginia on Sunday and the loser likely facing Massachusetts.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure that’s like a potential storyline going into this, but I’m entrenched in the season and thinking about our squad and how we have to get better,” Hurley said, declining to go into what kept him at Arizona State. “Once I made my statement, that was kind of it for me. For me, there’s no reason to rehash what transpired. I think that St. John’s is very happy with Mike Anderson and the job he’s doing. Our people feel the same way about what we’re building here.”</p>
      <p>Hurley has watched several St. John’s (4-1) games in preparation for this matchup and has been impressed. He noticed several differences between the team he will face Saturday and the one the Sun Devils (2-1) handily knocked off in the First Four last March.</p>
      <p>Obviously, starters Shamorie Ponds, Justin Simon and Marvin Clark II aren’t around anymore. Sophomores Marcellus Earlington, Josh Roberts and Greg Williams Jr., all of whom rarely played under Mullin a year ago, have been quality contributors. Recently cleared guard Rasheem Dunn has presented an added dimension as a third scorer behind LJ Figueroa and Mustapha Heron. But the biggest change Hurley has noticed is how quickly the 59-year-old Anderson has made his imprint on the Red Storm.</p>
      <p>“They play extremely hard, they’re very aggressive on defense, they have key guys that can get them points, and there’s more of a stable commitment defensively and also how they go to the offensive boards,” Hurley said. “There aren’t stretches where they are disconnected from what they are doing and they’re really competing. They’re making second-effort, third-effort plays defensively.</p>
      <p>“There appears to be a good cohesiveness among the players that are out there. They are playing a lot of guys and the chemistry looks good. There’s a purpose to what they’re doing. They want to attack; they want to play quick; they’re going to make you uncomfortable and try to turn you over.”</p>
      <p>It’s obviously a small sample size, just five games, but the early returns are positive. This weekend will present a good test, starting with Arizona State and possibly Virginia, and Hurley expects to see more of what St. John’s has exhibited so far — the pressure defense, the selfless basketball, the nonstop attacking — on display at Mohegan Sun.</p>
      <p>“That’s how he coaches,” he said. “You’re seeing a lot of what he’s done in the past.”</p>
