      <h1>Chahal: Calgary and Alberta need to think harder and work smarter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T05:00:57+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang has a campaign slogan, MATH — Make America Think Harder. I am borrowing it and changing it to Make Alberta Think Harder.</p>
      <p>As a born and raised Calgarian, I am an optimist and proud Canadian. I believe in this city, in this province and in all of you, the residents of Calgary.  In the past, we have persevered through difficult times and rose to the occasion when hosting the 1988 Winter Olympics. For over 100 years, we have brought the Calgary Stampede to the world, celebrating our history, including our Indigenous communities. From major events to our sports teams, we have always put our best forward. We have good reasons to be proud as Calgarians. However, for too long we have celebrated the past rather than focusing on the future.</p>
      <p>Calgarians are frustrated with all levels of government, frustrated with the lack of opportunity and frustrated with the rising cost of living. We have always been a generous city and a generous province. However, in difficult times, our generosity is tested and our faith in our neighbours questioned.</p>
      <p>City council will be debating our fiscal and social priorities next week during budget deliberations. Tough times will result in tough decisions. I can assure you that all city councillors, regardless of political perspective, are compassionate and doing their best to find a way forward. It is a mistaken assumption that services can be maintained without raising taxes. Spending cuts will result in job losses, facility closures and reduced services. We will need to make choices between needs and wants.</p>
      <p>We Calgarians need to understand that nearly 30 per cent of our annual property taxes are transferred to the Alberta government as an education tax. The municipal tax burden falls at the feet of Calgary residents and business owners. The City of Calgary manages provincially supported programs without sufficient resources and we may need to reconsider our approach moving forward.</p>
      <p>I am inherently hopeful and see a way forward. A diversified, innovative economy is our way of the future. Calgary International Airport is an opportunity to leverage. It is an employment hub and inland port of cargo and logistics and creates over $6 billion in annual GDP for the region. New industries are emerging around the airport and we need to support and encourage further development.</p>
      <p>Calgary is also a gateway to the Canadian Rockies. We as a city and a business community need to do a better job of working with the Indigenous communities and local municipal neighbours to attract more visitors and be part of a global discussion on being a destination where people want to live, work, play and learn.</p>
      <p>We have a highly-skilled workforce and we need to attract companies and startups to optimize those skills. Just as Boston and Salt Lake City have reinvented themselves as innovative technology hubs, Calgary needs to do the same. We cannot exclusively focus on our natural resources sector. We need to utilize our intellectual wealth and reach out to assist other countries in developing their resources in a responsible manner. We can continue to be leaders in climate technology.  Our energy companies have been responsible, accountable and at the forefront in ensuring resource development is done in an ethical manner. We must tell this story.</p>
      <p>We need to encourage entrepreneurs to start businesses. Entrepreneurship starts in our homes. Home-based businesses should be permitted, whether it is providing food services or other services. Governments are excellent at imposing rules and fees, being inflexible and lacking common sense. This needs to stop.</p>
      <p>We as city council have to do a better job of establishing collaborative, healthy relationships with our neighbouring municipalities. We need to work as one metropolitan region. We need to support each other and be interconnected. Whether it is regional transportation networks or economic growth strategies, we must work smarter.</p>
      <p>We can do better and our strength is our collective will. We need to get out of the doldrums and stop feeling sorry for ourselves. Together, we need to restore optimism and re-engage our can-do mindset. I am not discouraged by the future. I remain optimistic and believe that by thinking harder and working smarter we will move forward.</p>
      <p>
