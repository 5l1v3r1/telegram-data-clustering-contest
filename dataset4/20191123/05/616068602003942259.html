      <p>Vernon is showing its love for Dalvir Nahal.</p>
      <p>When an open house was planned for Nahal, it did not take long for the event to take on a life of its own.</p>
      <p>Nahal is well respected in the community not only for her work as a civic leader – she is in her second term as a city councillor – but for her tireless fundraising work that has generated hundreds of thousands of dollars for local organizations that in turn, benefit everyone.</p>
      <p>The Bollywood Bang events Nahal organizes have become so popular other communities are using it as a template to celebrate their own diversity.</p>
      <p>She also received a multiculturalism and anti-racism award from the province earlier this year.</p>
      <p>And she does it all while battling cancer.</p>
      <p>“Not once has Dalvir asked for charity or sympathy in her battle with cancer. Not once has Dal Vir let cancer define who she is, or what she does for others,” said friend Josh Winquist. “Through her strength, grace and dignity, we as a community are witness to the real strength of character.”</p>
      <p>But her cancer battle has drained financial resources, so on Sunday, Nov. 24, the community is being invited to an open house at the Eclectic Med to show their love and respect for the community pillar.</p>
      <p>“There is going to be a live auction at 6 p.m. with Brian Martin. There is going to be a massive silent auction,” said close friend Kari Sargent. “It will be an open-house style so people can come whenever they want.”</p>
      <p>The $40 tickets include two glasses of wine and appies. Half of the ticket fee will go to Nahal as will proceeds from the auctions and those attending are being encouraged to pay with cash at the door.</p>
