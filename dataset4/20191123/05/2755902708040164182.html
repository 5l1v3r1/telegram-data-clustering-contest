          <i>VP Chiwenga BACK in Zim… Received by Chinese Ambassador, no gvt official in site</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Vice President Constantino Chiwenga is back in Zimbabwe after a prolonged absence due to illness.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ZimpapersI/status/1198064987853467649">was welcomed by Chinese Deputy Ambassador to Zimbabwe,</a> Mr Zhao Baogang upon his arrival at RG Mugabe Inter Airport this morning on Nov 23, 2019.</p>
      <p>Also part of the welcome entourage was his elder brother Onisimo and son Tawanda and curiously, no government officials were in sight.</p>
      <p>This follows after he <a href="https://iharare.com/breaking-sick-vp-chiwenga-flown-to-china-for-medical-tests/">was airlifted to China</a> in July ago following a medical emergency.</p>
      <p>According to close sources, by the time the VP touched base in China he was bedridden and severely emaciated such that the Chinese doctors has to stabilize him first before performing surgical procedures.</p>
      <p>Chiwenga was reportedly admitted with oesophageal motility disorder, and has since undergone two major life saving operations to date.</p>
      <p>There were whispers that  he was allegedly poisoned by his enemies although Chiwenga himself remained mum on the issue.</p>
      <p>There were also rumors that Zanu PF Bigwigs  were plotting to topple the ailing Vice President from power after his prolonged absence.</p>
      <p>His political rivals were reportedly plotting to remove him from the power equation citing his poor health and incapacitation to do his job.</p>
      <p>Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri had already been named as the potential successor to the Vice President according to the rumors.</p>
      <p>His wife, <a href="https://iharare.com/marry-chiwenga-back-in-zim/">Marry Chiwenga came back to Zimbabwe alone</a> in October and continued to do her executive duties as the second lady.</p>
      <p>There were no reports of the VP’s health then, amid more rumors that he had fired some of his security personnel <a href="https://iharare.com/vp-chiwenga-bans-wife-marry/">and had banned Marry from visiting him</a> for security reasons.</p>
      <p>She officiated as the guest of honour at the opening of the Borrowdale Brooke sewage plant.</p>
