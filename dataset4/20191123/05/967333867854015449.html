        <b>Violent protests sparked on Thursday during nationwide demonstrations and strikes in Colombia were resumed on Friday in the country’s capital, prompting authorities to declare a curfew in Bogota, the first since the 1970s.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Late on Friday, some dozens of protesters relocated from the centre of Bogota to adjacent areas surrounding the residence of President Ivan Duque, ignoring a  citywide curfew and blocking road traffic. Videos posted to social media depicted a mob chanting and making rhythmic noises using simple household items like pans and bowls.</p>

      <p>​Duque earlier on Friday imposed a curfew on the entire city of Bogota, after peaceful protest rallies kicked off earlier this week turned violent.</p>

      <p>​Duque has authorized the use of emergency means for ensuring order during the protests, banning the possession of firearms and prohibiting the consumption and sale of alcohol.</p>

      <p>​In a televised address, Duque <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201910251077143785-argentina-brazil-colombia-us-call-on-bolivia-to-work-with-oas-to-ensure-credible-vote-count/">called for a "national conversation"</a> to discuss the grievances of Colombians that have lead to the massive unrest.</p>
      <p>Protests <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201910301077177643-at-least-5-indigenous-people-killed-in-armed-group-attack-in-southwestern-colombia/">were initially planned</a> at a student rally, but some in the political opposition announced plans to hold a general strike the same day. <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201909261076893112-several-people-injured-in-explosion-in-university-in-colombia-capital/">Fearing that Colombia</a> might follow recent scenarios that have endangered the rule of several other Latin American administrations recently, the incumbent government has taken what it describes as preemptive measures.</p>
