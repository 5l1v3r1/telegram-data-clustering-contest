      <p>His Royal Majesty the Asantehene Otumfuo Osei Tutu II has paid a courtesy call on former president John Mahama at his campaign office in Accra.</p>
      <p>The Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II paid the visit to the office ahead of his UPSA Leadership Lecture 2019.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the visit, former president Mahama said he and Otumfuo have a relationship underpinned by “mutual respect and brotherliness.”</p>
      <p>“It was an opportunity to once again discuss with the Asantehene a number of critical national development issues, and also tap into his wise counsel. Otumfuo Asantehene and I have always had a relationship underlined by mutual respect and brotherliness, and it was indeed a great honour to welcome him and his delegation.” Mahama wrote.</p>
      <p>“I was joined by the National Chairman of the NDC Samuel Ofosu Ampofo, Second Deputy Speaker of Parliament Alban Bagbin, former Chief of Staff Julius Debrah, executives of the NDC and former appointees to welcome the Asantehene.” He added.</p>
      <p>The visit comes after a public spat between the two over revelations that John Mahama was convinced to accept defeat in the last election.</p>

        <b>UPSA lecture – referendum</b>
      </p>
      <p>After the visit, the respected king of the Ashanti people speaking at the Annual Leadership Lecture Series organised by the University for Professional Studies, Accra (UPSA) said had chiefs been consulted, some chiefs would not have declared that the proposal to elect Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs) and political party participation in the same process was incompatible.</p>
      <p>“Local government in the modern era is only traditional government in Western attire. How is it possible then that the central government representing the modern state and nananom [chiefs] representing the traditional state could find no space for engagement for the consideration of a major reform on local government and to agree a common position before such crucial reforms were rolled out.”</p>
      <p>“If there had been such engagement, I could not think of how anyone would have ignored the logic in the case for according our chiefs the rightful representation in the new structure. And by the same token, I could not think of how any chief would have seen any incompatibility in the removal of the entrenched clauses in the Constitution to permit the election of the metro and district chief executives or mayors and also allow political parties to sponsor candidates for local elections,” he added.</p>
