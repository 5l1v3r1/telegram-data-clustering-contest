      <h1>City vs Chelsea: Citizens looking to halt Blues’ spectacular form</h1>

      <p>City succumbed to a 3-1 defeat to Liverpool before the international break, as Chelsea make the trip to the north-west having recorded six successive victories in the top flight, the reigning champions will be looking to halt the Blues’ impressive form.</p>
      <p>While losing out to Liverpool has left the Citizens nine points adrift of their rivals, Pep Guardiola may feel that his squad can now play without any pressure as they bid to win a third successive crown.</p>
      <p>City have long been considered the team to beat in English football but to a certain extent, they can now go about their business as underdogs to the Merseyside giants, something which could prove to be a blessing in disguise.</p>
      <p>In the game before the international break, there was not much between the two clubs, with City showing enough to suggest that the setback will not have a long-lasting effect going forward.</p>
      <p>Despite Chelsea being the form team in the division, there is an argument that this is the perfect match-up for Guardiola’s team as they look to make a statement.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the biggest concern for Guardiola is that his side have been below their best in three successive games, with a narrow win over Southampton and a hard-fought draw coming away at Atalanta BC before the visit to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>That said, it would have been a different story had City shown a clinical touch during the early stages of those outings, and that is something which Chelsea should be wary of ahead of this clash.</p>
      <p>While Chelsea have had a favourable fixture list in recent weeks, Frank Lampard and his team deserve credit for producing a run of form which has put the club in the mix for the title.</p>
      <p>However, this Blues side is still very much a work in progress, and Lampard himself will acknowledge that his emerging team must continue to work hard in order to match today’s opponents and Liverpool in the long term.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, despite a significant gulf in class and experience between the teams, the Englishman will be excited ahead of the challenge which awaits his team on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>Chelsea are far from the finished article at the back, although three of the last four goals which they have conceded have come through their own lack of concentration during the closing stages of matches.</p>
      <p>In Lampard’s eyes, those lessons have come at the right time, but it is now up to his defensive players to show that they are learning from mistakes which could have resulted in lost points.</p>
      <p>Despite the widespread plaudits which have been received for their attacking displays, Chelsea are still wasting too many opportunities, something which cannot afford to happen at the weekend.</p>
      <p>
        <i>To a certain extent, Chelsea are carrying no pressure heading into the contest, but Lampard knows that his players have a chance to move four points clear of City in the table, a margin which would have been regarded as extremely unrealistic a few months ago.</i>
