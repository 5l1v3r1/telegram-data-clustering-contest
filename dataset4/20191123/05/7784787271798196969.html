      <h3>James Courtney believes Supercars champion Scott McLaughlin should do his talking on the track in the wake of a series of off-track spats, some of which have seen emotions spill over on social media.</h3>
      <p>On Thursday, McLaughlin was embroiled in an Instagram stoush with Walkinshaw Andretti United driver Scott Pye, who likened the series champion to disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong.</p>
      <p>The drama engulfed the paddock on Friday, <a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/supercars/supercars-newcastle-2019-scott-mclaughlin-instagram-scott-pye-supercars-2019-supercars-news-newcastle-500/news-story/48d5e6ef19b9f49c695826a154fdfd8e">prompting Supercars to reiterate its social media policy</a> and review the very public taunts.</p>

      <p>Earlier this week, Steven Johnson told <i>The Driver’s Seat </i>radio show that WAU co-owner Ryan Walkinshaw sent McLaughlin a “cheat” text message in the wake of the dual Bathurst scandals which saw DJR Team Penske fined twice, docked 300 teams’ championship points and McLaughlin stripped of his Bathurst pole.</p>
      <p><i>The Daily Telegraph</i> also reported that Pye’s teammate Courtney had a run-in with McLaughlin after Friday’s running.</p>
      <p>Prior to qualifying on Saturday, Courtney explained the situation to Fox Sports’ Chris Stubbs, saying the sport’s benchmark driver should let his dominant 2019 campaign do the talking.</p>
      <p>“I was trying to have a joke with him and he got upset,” Courtney said.</p>
      <p>“He said some colourful things towards me, I was trying to break the ice and say that I was on his side.</p>
      <p>“He was a bit emotional about it all, but it’s time he stops talking and points to the results, because that’s enough.”</p>

      <p>After setting the fastest time in practice, Jamie Whincup said he hopes McLaughlin is taking control of the situation.</p>
      <p>However, Whincup didn’t give the Ford squad a free pass, suggesting McLaughlin should bring the team into line after the Bathurst controversies which cast a pall over the Bathurst and title wins.</p>
      <p>“He’s in a difficult position for sure, but you can say it’s self-inflicted or not,” Whincup said.</p>
      <p>“We don’t know what’s going on behind the scenes, but hopefully he’s taking control and telling the team to stop living in the grey area and play a straight bat.</p>
      <p>“It’s going to be more enjoyable for them, more enjoyable for us, more enjoyable for everyone if we just go out there and compete fairly, and that whoever stands on the top step deserves the grand prize.”</p>
