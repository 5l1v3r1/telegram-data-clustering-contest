      <p>Iggy Azalea and Playboi Carti had over $350,000 worth of jewellery stolen from them when their home was broken into.</p>
      <p>According to reports, Iggy’s Atlanta home she shares with her US rapper boyfriend was robbed on Sunday, with sources claiming to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/22/iggy-azalea-playboi-carti-home-burglarized-jewelry-missing-stolen-thief-atlanta/">TMZ</a> that jewellery totalling to $366,000 (£285,000) was taken.</p>
      <p>The insider claims missing items include rings, bracelets, watches, earrings, chains and a diamond engagement ring.</p>

      <p>Iggy was previously engaged to basketball player Nick Young.</p>

      <p>TMZ reports that Iggy informed police officials that she was alone in the house at the time of the burglary.</p>
      <p>She claims to have heard footsteps in the house, but thought nothing of it at the time, and said she had left the back door to the house unlocked for Playboi.</p>

        <i>Metro.co.uk have reached out to Iggy’s rep.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Iggy and Playboi, real name Jordan Terrell Carter, have been dating since September last year and moved in together in Atlanta just two months later.</p>
      <p>The couple are known for keeping their relationship pretty private and away from social media, but speaking to Fader back in June, Playboi said of Iggy: ‘Once I started talking to her, I just cut off everybody. It was over with.’</p>
      <p>Iggy, meanwhile, publicly addressed their romance a few months ago while hitting back at criticism over the six-year age gap between herself and Playboi – Iggy is six years older than him.</p>
      <p>The Fancy hit-maker posted online: ‘Is that unusual to you? Because almost everyone I know isn’t the exact age as the person they date.</p>
      <p>‘You all act like he’s some little kid that just left school or I’m some old ass woman. We are both in our twenties, get off my nuts.’</p>
