      <p>Harris said: "Mozza (Sean Morrison) is looking OK, he has trained all week, Jazz (Richards) and Armand (Traore) haven’t played so aren’t there. (Robert) Glatzel has a tight hamstring so we’ll make a decision on that. (Joe) Ralls is a superstar but need to get him fit as well."</p>
      <p>Bowyer: “We’ve only got a 23 or 22-man squad and we’ve got 10 out. That is nearly half. If it carries on then we won’t be able to put out a starting 11.</p>
      <p>“The only position we are strong is at the back. There are not many to choose from in midfield – three. The ones available are Conor Gallagher, Josh Cullen and Erhun Oztumer.</p>
      <p>“I think we’ll maybe have to look at playing a different way. We’ll go through a couple of things – some shape work – to see what looks good for the players we have.</p>
      <p>“It’s tricky, definitely tricky.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>What the managers have said</b>
      </p>
      <p>Harris on Bowyer: "He was linked with the job, but he’s done fantastic at Charlton and they’ve had some real momentum from last season. Had a real strong start, not so much recently. Lee has spoken about injuries and not being able to fill a bench but we’ll see when we get there.</p>
      <p>"I know Lee, it’s going to be competitive, tough challenge at The Valley but a game we’re ready for.</p>
      <p>"Players have had structure this week, we’re ready."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.londonnewsonline.co.uk/neil-harris-appointment-as-cardiff-city-manager-gives-extra-work-for-charlton-athletic-boss-lee-bowyer/">Bowyer on Harris</a>: "It is a bit more difficult because the players he has to work with now are different to the ones he had at Millwall.</p>
      <p>“But I’ve been watching Cardiff under the last manager, Neil Warnock, and Millwall under Neil Harris. I need to see Cardiff’s players, what they are good at, and also what Neil Harris was doing at Millwall – the way he tried to play.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think it will change too much. A lot of people have a set way of playing, it’s just the personnel are different. So then it is about the strengths and weaknesses of those personnel.”</p>
      <p>
