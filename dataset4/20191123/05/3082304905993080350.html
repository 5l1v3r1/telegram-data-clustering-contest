      </p>
      <p>The 2019 SEA Games will see Esports feature for the very first time in the competition history. The fast-growing sport makes it way into the roster with several medals on the line.</p>
      <p>The main events will start mid-way through the competition on December 5. Qualifiers and knockouts will then take place every single day leading up to the penultimate day of the games on December 10, when the final medal – Tekken 7 – will be handed out.</p>
      <p>Among the games this year, DOTA 2 remains the most popular. That particular discipline will be contested between December 7 and December 9. Hearthstone, Starcraft II, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, Arena of Valor, and Tekken 7 are the games contested.</p>
      <p>All the events will take place at the FilOil Flying V Centre.</p>
      <p>
