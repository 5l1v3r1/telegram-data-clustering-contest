      <p>The Lions forward curled in a free-kick to make it three wins from four under their new manager.</p>
      <p>Their first victory on the road this term was built on defensive solidarity as they frustrated a sloppy Swansea side.</p>
      <p>Rowett said: "Since coming into the club we've looked for players with those Millwall characteristics of hard work, energy and desire like he gave here, with that added bit of quality.</p>
      <p>"Jed has always been a good player, he's a really flexible player who can play in any of the forward positions.</p>
      <p>"He has some really good traits, he matches his quality with his work ethos for the team which is really important for us moving forward.</p>
      <p>"Jed's an infectious character, he wants to work, he wants to play and he wants to go and train, that's how he is."</p>
      <p>Wallace fired over from close range just before half-time after following up <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/connor-mahoney/"><b>Connor Mahoney</b></a>'s saved shot, but he made no mistake after the interval.</p>
      <p>Swansea defender Mike van der Hoorn tangled with Wallace as he threatened to get on the end of a hopeful ball downfield.</p>
      <p>Referee <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andy-davies/"><b>Andy Davies</b></a> blew for a free-kick and booked the Swansea defender, before Wallace dusted himself off and found the top corner with a curling free-kick from 20 yards out.</p>
      <p>Davies had another big call to make in the final 10 minutes when <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/george-byers/"><b>George Byers</b></a> appeared to pull Jiri Skalek down in the box to prevent him getting to Wallace's cross. But the referee waved away the Millwall protests.</p>
      <p>In the end it did not matter as the visitors held on for victory and Rowett added: "It was a really nice way to end the run of games without an away win. The players were conscious of it and needed to do something about it.</p>
      <p>"We've worked on a formation the last few weeks to help us away from home. We felt we needed to change something, not just from a football or tactical perspective but from a psychological perspective.</p>
      <p>"We created the best chances of the match and I thought we were relatively comfortable in terms of Swansea's chances."</p>
      <p>Swansea have only managed to claim four points from a possible 18 at home in recent months and manager Steve Cooper admits they were deservedly beaten.</p>
      <p>He said: "We certainly fell short, that's for sure.</p>
      <p>"We'll always take a look at ourselves first and we all know back in the dressing room that we weren't at the level today â€“ not in any area of the pitch.</p>
      <p>"It's not a good return, those four losses at home. We know that, but I don't think it's about momentum or there being any added pressure. We just did not play well.</p>
      <p>"When we did have moments we did not capitalise on them, and we have conceded a disappointing goal. So, lots of things accumulated into it being a poor performance.</p>
      <p>"We have got to be good at dealing with what comes our way and we work to make sure we have solutions.</p>
      <p>"They put a lot of bodies around their box, but we have good enough players to play through and around that, but we did not do that."</p>
