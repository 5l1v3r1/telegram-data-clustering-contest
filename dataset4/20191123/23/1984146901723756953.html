      <p>A woman has been killed in a hit-and-run in Newcastle.</p>
      <p>The 75-year-old was knocked down on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jesmond">Jesmond</a> Road shortly after 7.20pm on Saturday and died at the scene. A 79-year-old man, who was with the woman at the time, was taken to hospital with serious injuries believed to be life-threatening.</p>
      <p>The pair were hit by a dark car near the Punch Bowl pub and police say it made off from the scene. Officers are currently trying to find the vehicle and its driver and are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with dash cam footage to come forward.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Matt Sykes, of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">Northumbria Police’s</a> motor patrols unit, said: "This has been a terrible collision where a woman has sadly lost her life and a man is in hospital with very serious injuries. Our thoughts are with their family and friends at this time.</p>
      <p>"Enquiries are now being carried out by our officers to establish exactly what has happened – but we still need to speak to people who witnessed the collision or have any information about this collision.</p>
      <p>“If anybody saw what happened, or thinks they may have dash cam footage that could assist with us, I would ask them to contact police as soon as possible.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is asked to contact 101 quoting reference 883 23/11/19 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
