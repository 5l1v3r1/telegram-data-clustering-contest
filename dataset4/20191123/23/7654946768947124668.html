      <h1>Nets’ resurgence without Kyrie Irving had to happen this way</h1>

      <p>Maybe it took losing their top three players to convince the Nets to go from Brooklyn Glitz back to Brooklyn Grit. But it’s actually working.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/23/kyrie-irving-to-miss-3-game-road-trip-wont-face-knicks-or-celtics/">Kyrie Irving is going to miss at least the three-game road trip</a> that starts Sunday against the Knicks in the Garden, and Kevin Durant and Caris LeVert will be out longer than that. So the shorthanded Nets have had to try to grind out defensive-minded victories, yet they will come across the East River having won three of four.</p>
      <p>“This is the way we’re going to have to win games, especially right now with two of our leading scorers out in Ky and Caris,” Garrett Temple said. “This is the way we’re going to have to win games. And honestly, this is the way we need to build our identity: defending.</p>
      <p>“Offense is going to take care of itself. We have enough people that can really score the ball. But defensively, if we can play four quarters like we’ve done the last two games, we’re going to be good.”</p>
      <p>The Nets weren’t anywhere near good to start the season, 4-7 after losing at Denver. Irving suffered a shoulder impingement at Utah, aggravated it by trying to play through it two days later against the Nuggets and hasn’t suited up since.</p>
      <p>“We know we have enough in this locker room to win. When Ky and Caris come back, its going to be way more than enough to win,” said Temple, whose plus-16 Friday against Sacramento was second-best on the team.</p>

      <p>“We have the pieces. We’ve got to stick to the gameplan, play a different brand of basketball maybe, but we’ve done a great job of carrying out the gameplan defensively and sharing the ball offensively.”</p>
      <p>Their 10th-ranked offense, to that point, was being undone by their sixth-worst defense. But they’ve flipped the script since losing Irving, their offense plummeting to sixth-worst but going 3-1 behind the sixth-best defense.</p>
      <p>“We’re putting some good defenders on the floor, that’s helped,” coach Kenny Atkinson said. “Garrett Temple, [Iman] Shumpert, Taurean [Prince] is obviously part of that. So, same system, we haven’t really changed anything. I think we’re just a little more consistent right now.</p>
      <p>“In Shump’s case, we needed some perimeter defense, needed somebody to create some activity and turnovers, and he’s that type of guy. Garrett’s the same type of guy. So the lineup we’re putting out there, that’s a big part of it.”</p>
      <p>Brooklyn added Shumpert after losing LeVert to a thumb injury, the ex-Knick bringing a needed defensive edge. He’s increased his minutes every game over the past four coming into Sunday’s meeting against his old club.</p>
      <p>Though Shumpert has seemingly helped the perimeter defense — finishing a plus-11 in Friday’s win over the Kings — he humbly claims it’s just his teammates being forced to communicate more to cover for the newcomer that’s actually benefited the defense.</p>
      <p>“I actually haven’t gotten all the way comfortable,” Shumpert said. “Right now what you’re seeing is a group of guys that’s just looking out for me … and it’s actually helped us a lot with our chemistry, just me coming not really knowing [everything] is forcing guys like Joe Harris to put me in the [right] spot.</p>
      <p>“It’s helping our communication, it’s helping us grow. Little by little they’re stringing me along, helping me find spots. … But it’s just been great for their communication. I don’t think this is a group of guys that were naturally talkative. … That’s what I add: I add communication, energy.”</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if Shumpert — temporarily taking the place of Wilson Chandler — will be around when Chandler’s PED suspension ends next month. And when both he and Temple lose minutes upon the returns of first Irving then LeVert, how can the Nets still defend with the same ferocity?</p>
      <p>“You just continue to do it,” Temple said, shrugging. “Both of those guys are unselfish players, they understand — especially Ky being a veteran — he understands what it takes to win. Everything is going to fall into place, and we’ll continue to do the same once they get back.”</p>
