      <h1>Swap animal bodies to explore in gorgeous Lost Ember</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T23:20:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 23:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/jonathan-bolding/" target="_blank">Jonathan Bolding</a></address>
      <p>Humanity has gone quite extinct. There’s mostly just animals left. At least that’s the case in Lost Ember, a game of exploration and body-swapping that just released on Steam. In the game, players are a wolf-spirit-thing that can jump between other animal bodies to explore a large world completely reclaimed by nature. It’s certainly a slick-looking game, and the emphasis on free-flowing exploration via different methods of travel seems like something novel. Early user reviews are quite positive.</p>
      <p>Here’s an official blurb: “Experience the contrasting stories of the fall of mankind and the lush life in a world reclaimed by nature with a wolf as your main character and a determined companion at your side. Explore the land, sea, and air, as you possess any creature you come across to experience life from a whole new perspective. Fly through gargantuan canyon valleys as a parrot! Tumble through the grass as a wombat! Swim through shimmering lakes as a fish! Your journey will take you from densely wooded jungles, to lush rainforest canopies, to barren desert plains and archaic temples.”</p>
      <p>We first reported on <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/lost-embers-teaser-trailer-is-gorgeous/"><u>Lost Ember back in 2016</u></a>, and the game has only gotten prettier since then. Developers Mooneye Studio previously did mobile game work, but this is their first big release and it’s clear that a lot of love has gone into it. Mooneye studios is based in Berlin and Hamburg, Germany.</p>
