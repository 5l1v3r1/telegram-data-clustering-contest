      <p>Freddie Mercury passed away 28-years ago to the day after a long battle with AIDS.</p>
      <p>And to mark the anniversary of his death, the singer’s longtime friend Peter Freestone has spoken out about the Queen frontman’s final days.</p>
      <p>Calling himself Freddie’s ‘chief cook and bottle washer, waiter, butler, secretary, cleaner and agony aunt,’ <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/1208209/Freddie-Mercury-death-died-November-1991-AIDS-Queen-band-fans-friends-interview">the star opened up to The Express about how the late icon</a> wanted to die on his ‘own terms’.</p>
      <p>He told the publication: ‘The last time I saw him he was relaxed and prepared…</p>
      <p>‘We all knew it could not be too long, but Freddie’s doctor had said that he could be with us for quite a few days longer. I tend to feel that Freddie had decided he had had enough and it was time to go under his own terms.’</p>

      <p>Peter added: ‘He didn’t get depressed. He wasn’t afraid. It was a fact he was going to die. In those days there was absolutely nothing could change that. So he got on with his music.</p>

      <p>‘He did so much in those last four years.’</p>
      <p>Peter isn’t the only one of Freddie’s friends to talk about the Radio Ga Ga hitmaker’s death, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/elton-john-says-freddie-mercury-physically-terrifying-look-final-days-death-aids-11186836/">as Elton John recently spoke about the last time he saw the singer when chatting to David Walliams.</a></p>
      <p>Speaking in front of a live audience at Eventim Apollo, in London, the 72-year-old said up until his death Freddie was only thinking of everyone else.</p>

      <p>‘I didn’t go and see him often as Aids was terrifying and he was physically terrifying to look at,’ Elton said, <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/elton-john-sleeps-final-freddie-20919374">according to Daily Star.</a> ‘While he was dying he was still buying things at auction.</p>
      <p>‘He wasn’t thinking about dying at all. He showed no fear to me about dying, no fear or sadness. When you went there you had an audience with Freddie.’</p>
      <p>The Honky Cat hitmaker recalled receiving a gift from Freddie of a watercolour painting that continues to sit next to his bed.</p>
      <p>‘On Christmas morning Tony King came round and gave me this pillowcase,’ Elton explained.</p>
      <p>‘As you read in the book my drag name is Sharon and Freddie was Melina.</p>

      <p>‘In this beautiful pillowcase was this watercolour painting. In the note that went with it said “Dear Sharon, I saw this at auction and I thought you would love it. I love you Malena”.’</p>
