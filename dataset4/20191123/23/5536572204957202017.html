      <p>It is truly the year of the feline.</p>
      <p>During Saturday’s clash between the Memphis Tigers and South Florida Bulls, a grey cat became the center of attention after it ran out on the field.</p>
      <p>Unlike the Monday Night football cat, the grey cay didn’t score a touchdown as it quickly ran out of bounds and hid under a cart.</p>
