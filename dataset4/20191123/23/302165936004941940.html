      <p>TAIPEI, Nov 24 — Taiwanese family drama <i>A Sun</i> won top prizes at the Golden Horse film awards yesterday in a year marked by the conspicuous absence of talent from China amid plummeting ties between Taipei and Beijing.</p>
      <p>Dubbed the Chinese-language “Oscars,” Golden Horse got into trouble with Beijing after a Taiwanese director called for the island’s independence in an acceptance speech at last year’s ceremony.</p>
      <p>There were no mainland films in this year’s nomination list after China’s national film board ordered the country’s directors and stars to boycott the event.</p>
      <p>Acclaimed Hong Kong director Johnnie To has resigned as head of the jury citing contractual obligations as several Hong Kong films reportedly also dropped out under pressure from Beijing.</p>
      <p>In another move likely to annoy Beijing, Taiwanese composer Lu Lu-ming yesterday voiced support for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests, dedicating his best original film song to “Hong Kongers who insist on ideals, and may you live safely and freely.”</p>
      <p>The night’s biggest winner was Taiwanese director Chung Mong-hong’s <i>A Sun</i>, which scooped best picture, best director, best actor, best supporting actor and best editing awards.</p>
      <p>“I thought it would take several more years for me to win best picture. I am very happy... although the movies I made haven’t made any profit,” Chung said after receiving the award from Oscar-winning director Ang Lee.</p>
      <p>Singapore-based Malaysian Yeo Yann-Yann was crowned best actress for playing a married teacher struggling with family and work woes who develops a forbidden relationship with a male pupil in the Singaporean drama <i>Wet Season</i>.</p>
      <p>“It’s not easy going down the path in the entertainment (industry) in Singapore and Malaysia... but I will continue walking the path,” she said at the ceremony in Taipei’s Sun Yat-sen memorial hall.</p>
      <p>Also yesterday, China kicked off its top biannual films fest Golden Rooster Awards featuring some of the best known Chinese-language cinematic talents.</p>
      <p>Following Beijing’s boycott, Golden Horse reportedly lost a number of international sponsors, although only Italian luxury sports car brand Maserati confirmed its decision to cut sponsorship ties to uphold Beijing’s “one China” principle.</p>
      <p>China considers democratic Taiwan as part of its territory awaiting reunification, by force if necessary, even though the two sides have been governed separately for the last seven decades.</p>
      <p>Beijing has been ramping up military, diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan ever since President Tsai Ing-wen was elected in 2016, because her party refuses to recognise that the island is part of “one China”.</p>
      <p>Pressure is building once more as Taiwan heads towards new elections in January, with Tsai seeking to defeat an opponent who favours much warmer ties with China. — AFP</p>
