      <p>Voting is under way in Hong Kong elections that have become a barometer of public support for anti-government protests now in their sixth month.</p>
      <p>The polls opened on Sunday morning for 452 seats in the city’s 18 district councils.</p>
      <p>The councils are largely advisory and have little power. But the election has taken on symbolic importance in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.</p>
      <p>A strong showing by the opposition would show that the public still supports the pro-democracy movement, even as the protests have become increasingly violent.</p>
      <p>The ruling camp in Hong Kong and the national government in Beijing hope that the unrest and disruption to daily life will turn voters against the movement.</p>
