      <p>Large swathes of the Arsenal support now want Emery to be sacked and there were shouts of ‘Emery out’ at the full-time whistle to accompany the boos.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard admits he understands supporters’ frustrations but says it’s important to stick together.</p>
      <p>‘I understand the supporters are angry and frustrated,’ said Emery.</p>
      <p>‘The players are feeling the same and my job is to find out how to improve and the key is to be with the supporters. Our target was to win but also to play well and we didn’t do that.’</p>
