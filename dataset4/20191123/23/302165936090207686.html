      <h1>Carousell sells a new way to shop online... especially for Singaporeans</h1>

      <p>NOVEMBER 24 — I have a 4.5 rating. It isn’t my ride-share or food-deliver rating. This is my Carousell rating.</p>
      <p>Carousell is a fast-growing online marketplace in Singapore.</p>
      <p>It’s grown so quickly over the last three years that “to Carousell” (ie to sell an item online) is a real Singlish verb and I am genuinely embarrassed by my rating.</p>
      <p>That loss of half a star was caused by one buyer I left hanging after striking up a conversation.</p>
      <p>This haunts me.</p>
      <p>On Carousell, your online rating can make the difference between winning or losing a bid.</p>
      <p>After all, a lot of the app is predicated on trust. It’s largely person to person sales with a few big stores or retailers using it so you trust that on offer made is genuine or that payment will be followed by the delivery of the item — and you do all this anonymously.</p>
      <p>So all you have to go on is the rating really. And the reviews.</p>
      <p>Now, what’s really amazing about Carousell is that it was recently valued at S$1 billion (RM3 billion). Quite amazing for a three-year-old local firm whose founders are barely 30 years old.</p>
      <p>They started out with help from a S$7,000 grant from the National University of Singapore and are now a home-grown unicorn.</p>
      <p>Here we have local kids solving a local problem: how to get online commerce for everyone. And I mean everyone.</p>
      <p>These days Carousell is firmly a part of the local lexicon. Personally, I have met sellers of every age and ethnicity on Carousell.</p>
      <p>There have been old uncles selling their furniture or young women selling second-hand handbags.</p>
      <p>The fact that it is hyper local and trust-based makes a huge difference. You typically meet the other seller and this eliminates delivery services and waiting time — perfect for a small geographical location like Singapore.</p>
      <p>Carousell allows you to settle transactions not just in app but also using cash or local banking transfer solution PayNow which means it is great for credit card- and online payment-unsavvy older generations.</p>
      <p>Uptake has been tremendous with hundreds of new users joining the platform every day — spurring an astronomical valuation.</p>
      <p>Impressive because at first glance, an online P2P marketplace is hardly an original idea; eBay did it ages ago, but Carousell created something that worked for our local market.</p>
      <p>They empowered buyers and sellers across the country and created a platform investors clearly think is scalable and valuable.</p>
      <p>This is a lesson to aspiring entrepreneurs; sometimes it’s not the most innovative idea that wins out. Customisation, localisation and diligently building communities can bring wild success and even create unicorns.</p>
