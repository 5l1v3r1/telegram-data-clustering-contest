      <p>Surging WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder (41-0-1, 40 KO) will look to solidify his status as the baddest man on the planet this evening (Sat., Nov. 23, 2019) live on FOX PPV from inside MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, when he runs it back with Cuban contender Luis Ortiz (31-1, 26 KO).</p>
      <p>This will be a rematch from their first encounter back in March of 2018. That fight took place inside Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, and produced one of the most memorable finishes of the year.</p>
      <p>After getting outclassed on the feet early into the fight, Wilder was forced to make up ground in the later rounds. "Bronze Bomber" did just that as he launched his patented looping power punches and ended up catching Ortiz with a 10th-round TKO. It was the second-latest finish of Wilder's professional boxing career.</p>
      <p>Check out the full fight video replay above courtesy of Premier Boxing Champions (PBC).</p>
      <p>Not only did this win keep Wilder's undefeated professional boxing record in tact but it helped set up his late-2018 clash with Tyson Fury. "Bronze Bomber" will now have another chance to take out Ortiz and lock down a rematch with "Gypsy King" next year.</p>
