      <h1>Callum Smith clings on to world title but judges ruin thriller against John Ryder</h1>
      <h2>Smith was defending the belt he won from George Groves for a second time - and made light work of Ryder</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T23:04:40+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 23:04</time> by <a rel="author">David Anderson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-anderson/</a></address>
      <p>Callum Smith was given a fright by John Ryder before he managed to retain his super-middleweight and Ring magazine titles.</p>
      <p>Smith struggled for parts of his homecoming fight against the gutsy Ryder before winning by a unanimous decision.</p>
      <p>The scoring was suspect and the fight was much closer than the judges’ scorecards of 117-111 and 116-112 twice.</p>
      <p>Smith looked relieved and Ryder gutted at the end and the challenger deserved much better treatment by the judges.</p>
      <p>Smith admitted he had been off colour and said: “It was a tough fight. He stopped me from doing what I’m good at do</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t my best performance. He made it hard for me. You never know that performance may tempt some of my opponents to come and fight me.”</p>

      <p>Ryder fought brilliantly and overcame his height and reach disadvantage to push Smith all the way.</p>
      <p>Ryder was not impressed by the scoring and said: “I feel that’s harsh. I give my life and soul to boxing. But I will come again.”</p>
      <p>Smith, 29, who extended his unbeaten record to 27-0, will walk on with hope in his hear that he will get his dream fight at Anfield and promoter Eddie Hearn is in talks with Liverpool about fighting there at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>The opening round was cagey and Ryder stepped inside to land a combination to Smith’s head</p>
      <p>The Islington fighter had more success at the start of the second round and Smith responded with a couple of body shots.</p>

      <p>The southpaw challenger proved to be awkward for Smith and he pined the champion against the ropes in the fourth.</p>
      <p>Ryder continued to have joy trading in the pocket and a cut appeared over Smith’s right eye in the fifth.</p>
      <p>Smith had sustained success in the sixth and he stung Ryder with a powerful straight right.</p>
      <p>Back came Ryder and he hurt Smith with a left hook in the seventh as he pinned him in one of the neutral corners.</p>
      <p>Smith was in trouble in the 11th and his wound over his eye opened up as Ryder repeatedly landed.</p>
      <p>The champion looked drained in the 12th and was fighting on instinct as he held off Ryder to win.</p>
