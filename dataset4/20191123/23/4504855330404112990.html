      <p>MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, FLA. (WSVN) - A flight that had departed Miami International Airport for Cuba turned around and made an emergency landing at the airport, officials said.</p>
      <p>According to Miami-Dade Fire Rescue, they received a call of a plane in distress, just after 8 a.m., Saturday.</p>
      <p>Officials said Swift Air Flight 730 had departed MIA at 7:30 a.m. heading to Santa Clara when was forced to return due to a possible mechanical issue.</p>
      <p>The aircraft landed safely on the tarmac but was unable to reach the gate on its own.</p>
      <p>No injuries were reported.</p>
      <p>Passengers were bussed back to the gate. That led to long lines at the ticket counters, as travelers were booked on a new flight.</p>
