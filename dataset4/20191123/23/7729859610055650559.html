      <p>Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski lost the deciding doubles rubber 7-6 (6-3) 7-6 (10-8) against the team of Rafael Nadal and Feliciano Lopez in front of a partisan home crowd.</p>
      <p>In the absence of Andy Murray, Kyle Edmund had given Leon Smith's side a 1-0 lead with a convincing singles win over Lopez in the opening match of the tie.</p>

      <p>The world No 69 followed up his straight-set wins in the ties against Kazakhstan and Germany with a 6-3 7-6 (7-3) win against Lopez - who himself was a late replacement for Pablo Carreno Busta, who pulled out with illness.</p>
