      <p>The remarkable rise of Brendon Todd showed no sign of waning when he charged into the third-round lead of the PGA Tour's RSM Classic in Georgia.</p>
      <p>Todd, seeking a rare hat-trick of consecutive victories tour, putted sublimely on Saturday to card eight-under-par 62 on the Seaside course at Sea Island.</p>

      <p>It was just about the worse score he could have shot, as he lipped out several putts, including a 30-foot birdie chance at the last that left him laughing when it caught a large part of the cup but refused to drop.</p>
      <p>Todd posted an 18-under 194 total to lead by two shots heading into the final round.</p>
      <p>A win on Sunday would make him the first player since Tiger Woods in 2006 to win three consecutive PGA Tour events.</p>
      <p>Dustin Johnson in 2017 was the last to win three-straight starts, though he skipped a tournament during that run.</p>
      <p>Todd's fellow American Webb Simpson (63) and Colombian Sebastian Munoz (66) are equal second in Georgia on 16-under.</p>
      <p>D.J. Trahan (67) is solo fourth at 15-under while Tyler Duncan, who started the third round with a two-shot lead, made 18 pars for a 70 to be tied for fifth at 14-under.</p>

      <p>Australian Rhein Gibson will need a miracle to contend after a four-over 74, which included a double bogey and triple bogey on the last resulted in him plummeting from equal second overnight to tied 39th at eight-under.</p>
      <p>His compatriot Matt Jones fared marginally better with a two-over 72 that left him at four-under and a share of 69th.</p>
      <p>Todd, who overcame a case of the full yips that nearly drove him from the game, was ranked 525th in the world before winning the Bermuda Open three weeks ago.</p>
      <p>He followed up with victory at last week's Mayakoba Classic in Mexico.</p>
      <p>He missed 37 of 41 cuts from 2016-18 before regaining his PGA Tour card this year.</p>
      <p>Along the way he read a book by Australian golfer Bradley Hughes and began working with the writer and swing guru.</p>
      <p>"I went and saw him and it's just kind of been a home run ever since," Todd said in a May interview.</p>
