        <b>Callum Smith retain his world super-middleweight title with a unanimous points victory over a dogged John Ryder in Liverpool.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Smith, defending his unbeaten record as a professional, was adjudged to have dominated the opening rounds before Ryder closed the distance between them and the gap on the scorecards late on.</p>
      <p>TV pundits largely gave Smith the edge, despite his bloodied face come the end of 12 bruising rounds, but there was a general feeling that the judges had failed to do justice to Ryder's contribution.</p>
      <p>"I didn't underestimate John, I knew he was a tough fighter," said Smith. "It wasn't the best performance, but I thought I won most of the early rounds.</p>
      <p>"I think I was due a bad one - first time getting a cut in a fight, and I'll be a better fighter because of it. I want a big name where if I turn up like tonight, I'll lose."</p>

      <p>Ryder felt as though he'd done enough to cause an almighty upset on Smith's turf, and was certainly the aggressor towards the end of the bout.</p>
      <p>"I've gone in against the world number one, feel like I just edged it. I do deserve to come again," said Ryder.</p>
      <p>"He's a great fighter, but I live and breathe this sport. We've not had the rub of the green lately, but that's just boxing.</p>
      <p>"I feel (the scoring) was harsh. I felt like I did enough to win that. I think I've done more than enough to show that I'm credible for this."</p>
      <p>Promoter Eddie Hearn praised both men at the end of an engrossing duel, before promising bigger and better things for Smith.</p>
      <p>"I thought it was a great fight - I thought Callum Smith dug in, I thought John Ryder was exceptional.</p>
      <p>"Now Callum moves on to take these mega fights. Sometimes when you don't put in a blistering performance, it's a lot easier to make fights. All of a sudden the phone starts ringing. Now, after a solid performance, you'd be surprised.</p>
      <p>"It's true - people start looking and saying 'maybe he's not as untouchable as we thought'. I really feel now, after two defences, he needs to be taking those big, legacy, career-defining fights."</p>
