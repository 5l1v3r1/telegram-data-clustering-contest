      <p>Supreme Court Justice <a href="https://thehill.com/people/ruth-ginsburg">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> was hospitalized on Friday night after she experienced chills and fever during the day, but her symptoms have died down, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pressreleases/pr_11-23-19">the court said in a statement</a>. </p>
      <p>"Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, last night after experiencing chills and fever earlier in the day," the statement said. </p>
      <p>"With intravenous antibiotics and fluids, her symptoms have abated and she expects to be released from the hospital as early as Sunday morning," the court added. </p>
      <p>The statement noted that there will be additional updates when they are available. </p>
