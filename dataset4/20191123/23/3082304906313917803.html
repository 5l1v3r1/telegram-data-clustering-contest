      <h1>Diego Simeone hails Atletico draw at Granada as arguably best performance of the season</h1>

        <b>Diego Simeone was frustrated not to beat Granada on Saturday given Atletico Madrid produced what he considered a strong performance.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Diego Simeone felt Atletico Madrid played perhaps their best game of the season in Saturday’s 1-1 LaLiga draw with Granada.</p>
      <p>Renan Lodi opened the scoring at Nuevo Estadio de Los Carmenes after an hour only for German Sanchez to equalise seven minutes later.</p>
      <p>The draw was Atleti’s seventh in their past 10 LaLiga matches and leaves them three points behind Barcelona and Real Madrid at the top of the table, having played a game more.</p>
      <p>Simeone was happy with the performance, though, blaming Atletico’s failure to hold on for a win on a “careless moment” that allowed Sanchez to head in from a corner.</p>
      <p>“This was our best performance of those away from home and also possibly of those at home too,” the coach told reporters.</p>
      <p>“We were very consistent, especially in the first 30 minutes. Granada didn’t get close to our penalty area.</p>
      <p>“We played a quite complete match, but we had a careless moment in the goal we conceded. But the team didn’t give up.”</p>

      <p>Joao Felix was fit enough only to appear as a second-half substitute, having been struggling with an ankle injury since last month.</p>
      <p>Simeone insists the 20-year-old must be given time to regain full fitness before he can be expected to make a significant impact.</p>
      <p>“I act as a result of what I see in training,” he said. “He has to keep picking up the pace.</p>
      <p>“He has great quality and talent and when he is fully fit he will contribute.”</p>
