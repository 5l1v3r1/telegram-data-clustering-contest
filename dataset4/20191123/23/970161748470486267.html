      <p>Hailey Baldwin has revealed that she is the ‘happiest girl in the world’ as she enjoyed some low-key birthday celebrations – after her husband, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/justin-bieber/">Justin Bieber</a>, teased that he wants to have babies with her.</p>
      <p>The model recently celebrated her 23<sup>rd</sup> birthday and rather than have a wild night out or a big birthday party with her pals, she instead decided to spend some quality time with her husband in the comfort of their own home.</p>
      <p>After all, she already had made sure to party hard at her <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/26/hailey-baldwin-wears-bridal-veil-classic-hen-justin-bieber-wedding-penis-cups-flying-10810932/">hen party before getting married to Justin back in September.</a></p>
      <p>Taking to Instagram stories, Hailey showed off a sneak peek of her romantic-looking dinner, with treats such as doughnuts and cupcakes also present on the table, as well as a cake with ‘Happy Birthday Hailey’ written on top in pink icing.</p>

      <p>‘I’m the happiest birthday girl in the world.’</p>
      <p>The quiet birthday celebrations make sense after she <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/hailey-baldwin-wanted-michael-jordan-themed-birthday-party-tired-entertain-guests-11204940/">recently revealed that she was ‘too tired’ to host a party for her big day</a> – despite originally having plans to host a Michael Jordan themed bash to mark the fact she was turning 23, as 23 had been the number on the basketball player’s back throughout his career.</p>
      <p>It also comes after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/justin-bieber-wife-hailey-baldwin-want-babies-next-season-singer-reveals-family-plans-11204340/?ito=article.mweb.share.bottom.link">the Biebs hinted that he would like to have children with his wife</a>, as he posted a sweet birthday tribute to her on his Instagram.</p>
      <p>Sharing a set of professional photos from their wedding day, he wrote: ‘Happy birthday babes! You make me want to be better everyday!</p>
      <p>‘The way you live your life is so attractive.. ps you turn me on in every way. Next season BABIES.’</p>
      <p>So could we be expecting a baby Bieber very soon? We hope so.</p>
