      <h1>Sabri Lamouchi "proud" of Nottingham Forest side after holding on for 10 men</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sabri-lamouchi/"><b>Sabri Lamouchi</b></a> praised the spirit of his <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/nottingham-forest/"><b>Nottingham Forest</b></a> players after they had played with 10 men for more than 30 minutes of a closely-fought Championship clash with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/bristol-city/"><b>Bristol City</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>The visitors had looked the better side until midfielder <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ryan-yates/"><b>Ryan Yates</b></a> picked up a straight red card from referee <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/craig-pawson/"><b>Craig Pawson</b></a> on 56 minutes for a challenge on <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/adam-nagy/"><b>Adam Nagy</b></a>, which provoked an angry reaction from City players.</p>
      <p>From then on City poured forward in search of a winner, but were unable to create many clear openings against determined and well-organised opponents.</p>
      <p>The hosts hit a post through <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andreas-weimann/"><b>Andreas Weimann</b></a>'s deflected cross on 55 minutes, but were relieved when Forest's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lewis-grabban/"><b>Lewis Grabban</b></a> volleyed wide with only <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dan-bentley/"><b>Dan Bentley</b></a> to beat 18 minutes later.</p>
      <p>Both sides attacked with promise throughout an open game, but it was Forest, backed by 2,300 vociferous travelling fans, who carried the greater threat, particularly in the first half.</p>
      <p>Lamouchi said: "I am so proud of my players. Ryan has made a mistake with the tackle that saw him sent off and I can see why the referee made the decision.</p>
      <p>"It was not an aggressive challenge, but more the result of enthusiasm, which isn't a bad thing to see in a young player.</p>
      <p>"He was very angry and upset with himself after the game because he knew what he did could have cost us an important result.</p>
      <p>"But the important thing is that he learns from it. Today the other players have made sure we didn't lose with 10 men and that is good for him.</p>
      <p>"We deserved our point and missed one very good chance to take all three. As always, the support from our fans was incredible.</p>
      <p>"Bristol City changed things and threw more men forward after the sending-off, so we had to defend really well. The spirit shown by the players was fantastic.</p>
      <p>"Bristol have a lot of very positive and talented attacking players. But we restricted them and our goalkeeper did not have to make many saves."</p>
      <p>Despite not making the most of having an extra man, Lee Johnson was not too down on his Bristol City side.</p>
      <p>"I didn't get a clear view of the sending-off, but I'm told it was a two-footed challenge, so I don't think they could have any complaints," he said.</p>
      <p>"Forest are a very good side and I expect them to be up there challenging when it matters most. We lacked a bit with our end product today, but overall I was delighted with the performance.</p>
      <p>"A number of our lads only got back from international duty on Thursday, yet there was no sign of any tiredness or lapses in concentration.</p>
      <p>"We tweaked one or two things tactically at half-time, which had an effect, and in the second half we got into some great positions without testing their goalkeeper enough. We put so many crosses in without getting a final touch.</p>
      <p>"That was the one disappointment. But we are gradually getting key players back from injury and there is a lot to look forward to.</p>
      <p>"We are still a young and developing side and there is so much more to come from us. We came up against very tough opponents this afternoon.</p>
      <p>"The players are giving me everything and I have no criticism of them today. We now move on to West Brom in midweek and will go there in confident mood."</p>
