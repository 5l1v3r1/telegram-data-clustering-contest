      <h1>Ohio State Likely Doesn’t Need To Beat Michigan To Reach The College Football Playoff</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T23:08:34+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 23:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Ohio State took down Penn State on Saturday, winning the Big Ten East in the process. The victory likely ensures the Buckeyes get a playoff spot if they win the Big Ten – regardless of what happens in the Michigan game.</p>
      <p>Ohio State is now 11-0 with games against Michigan and either Minnesota or Wisconsin left on the docket. The Buckeyes could likely lose to the Wolverines and still be one of the four teams selected for the College Football Playoff, so long as they wind up winning the Big Ten title game.</p>
      <p>Of course, Ohio State has no interest in losing to Michigan. The Buckeyes haven’t lost to their rival since 2011 and they’ve only lost twice this century. But in theory, it wouldn’t ruin their chances at being able to play for a national title.</p>
      <p>For what it’s worth, Alabama lost to Auburn two years ago, wound up getting selected anyway and won the national title.</p>

      <p>FiveThirtyEight’s playoff model suggests that <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-college-football-predictions/?ex_cid=rrpromo">Ohio State has a 61% chance</a> of making the playoff if it loses to Michigan.</p>
      <p>Ohio State will be favored by at least a touchdown, but there’s no doubt that Michigan has been playing well heading into the contest. The Wolverines will enter the game with a 9-2 record and losses to Penn State and Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>Ohio State vs. Michigan will kick off at Noon ET next Saturday.</p>
