      <p>EVEN the most optimistic observer knew before the November 16 governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states that the polls would be bloody and rambunctious. The police anticipated the looming catastrophe. That was why they deployed about 35,000 policemen of all shades for the poll. Another 31,000 were sent to Bayelsa State. Not even sniffer dogs were left out. If they did not foresee danger, why would they have sent such a large number of policemen to two states just because governorship elections were approaching? Is that the way it is in other countries, even African countries? Obviously not. After all, some of our political leaders who have had cause to visit some African countries as election observers have come back to tell us stories of how voting would take place till late in the night in some of these countries, with electoral officers sometimes keeping vigil and voters coming to cast their votes at their convenience without any evil befalling either the electoral officers or the election materials. But here, we usually conduct elections in broad daylight, yet, it does not stop people from snatching ballot boxes, buying votes openly, shooting to scare voters on election days, or falsifying election figures, among other electoral crimes. Eminent and not-so-eminent Nigerians had been caught on camera running away with ballot boxes. Nothing happened to them. Which, really, is the reason why electoral crimes appear to be thriving in the country.</p>
      <p>One point that usually makes me sick is the ferocious manner many of our politicians fight for political offices only to get there and mess up people’s lives. People who really intend to serve do not seek political power the way many of our politicians do. If only these politicians devote 50 percent of the energy they expend fighting for power to good governance, the country would not be in this sorry pass.  It is bad, that bad that even incumbents who should only make election time a time to showcase their achievements in the last four years start jumping from pillar to post and looking for distractions because they have little or nothing to point at as their achievements. People who should naturally have walkover at election time start getting jittery at the approach of the polls.</p>
      <p>That bitter struggle for power played itself out again in the Kogi and Bayelsa elections. Indeed, what passed for elections in the two states should really worry us as a people about what to expect in 2023 and in the other elections before then. Democracy is a game of numbers; at least in other places. It has no room for reason or rationale. It is supposed to depend on the electorate. In their wisdom they could vote in the best person for any office, just as they could also make the most foolish contender carry the day. The choice is theirs. But in the end they also should not complain about the choice they made or did not make because it is garbage in, garbage out. People get the kind of leadership they deserve.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, our politicians do not think voters are wise enough to decide for themselves, or that they even have a right to vote foolishly. The politicians therefore resort to self-help on Election Day. Unfortunately, too, the self-help is hardly peaceful. All manner of strong arm tactics come into play. They hire and arm thugs to the teeth to disrupt the process; ballot-box snatching is the order of the day, where the thugs are confronted by countervailing forces, they test their strengths, leaving in their trail gory tales. The least result is the maiming of innocent citizens or destruction of properties. Often, lives are lost in the process. Yet, politician after politician keeps saying their victory at the polls is not worth losing a single life over. Yet, the more they say this, the more blood we see flowing needlessly on the streets.</p>
      <p>We saw a lot of violence in the build-up to the elections in the two states but Kogi presented a case study in electoral violence. This was particularly so with what appeared to be the premeditated murder of Mrs Acheju Abuh, the Women Leader of Wada Aro Campaign Council, Ochadamu Ward, who was also the Women Leader for the campaign organisation of the Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) governorship candidate, Musa Wada, on November 18, barely two days after the governorship election.</p>
      <p>It is inconceivable that people with blood flowing in their veins would kill a fellow human being, and a woman for that matter, the way Mrs Abuh was killed. Over what? Politics? Incredible! The woman was in her house, resting, apparently after the long weeks of campaign that culminated in the November 16 election. According to media reports, thugs arrived at her residence at about 2.00 p.m., blocked every exit from the house to ensure that none of the occupants could escape  the evil intention they harboured in their minds. They then doused the house in petrol, set it ablaze amidst the booming of guns to scare terrified villagers away.</p>
      <p>A source said that “The blood-thirsty thugs waited, shooting and watching with relish while Mrs. Abuh cried from inside the inferno until her voice died out. They left when the entire house had been burnt to ashes, with Abuh in it.” The state police command’s spokesperson, William Aya, said in a statement that there was a misunderstanding between one Awolu Zekeri, a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC); and one Gowon Simeon, a member of the PDP, both of Ochadamu ward. He said, “Gowon Simeon stabbed Zekeri with a knife and he died on his way to hospital.</p>
      <p>“As a result, angry youths in the area mobilised to the house of one Simeon Abuh of same address, who is an uncle to the suspect, set it ablaze (and) thereby burnt one Salome Abuh, aged 60 years. Three other houses were also burnt. The corpse has been moved to the University Teaching Hospital Mortuary Anyigba, for autopsy.”</p>
      <p>Without doubt, Mrs Abuh was not the only person killed, whether in the course of the election or the run-up to it. Her murder, however, was too gory to behold. Only sadists who are not fit to live among human beings could have done such without batting an eyelid. Although reports said it was the very burglar proof that she had at home to keep away unwanted guests, like the hoodlums that eventually set her ablaze, and other criminals, that prevented her from escaping, the point is that given the determination of her killers, she still would have been killed if she had no such burglar proof.  If she had managed to escape from the inferno, her assailants would still have caught up with her somehow because they were bent on killing her. So, head or tail, she would have died.</p>
      <p>But her death must be avenged. Those who killed her must not go scot-free. Otherwise, it would mean that the country has lost its moral compass; indeed, its soul. The culprits must be apprehended and made to have their day in court. In the same vein, Simeon who allegedly stabbed Zekeri must be arrested to also account for his action just as every other act that would pass for electoral malfeasance or electoral violence should be punished, whether in Kogi or Bayelsa, or any other part of the country. These acts keep recurring because culprits are hardly punished.</p>
      <p>Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu’s claim that fake policemen were responsible for the electoral violence in Kogi and Bayelsa states speaks volume. But how many fake policemen could have overpowered 66,241 genuine and seemingly well trained policemen, leaves much to be desired. And if the police inspector-general could say that some politicians were planning to sew police uniforms for thugs to wear on the day of election, what did he do to forestall such? Many people saw video recordings of guns booming freely as if they were bangers, with people in police uniform snatching ballot boxes in Kogi. We should not be satisfied with IGP Adamu’s claim. He should tell us more.</p>
      <p>Without doubt, we saw bloodier electoral violence in Rivers State in 2015, in which case it could be said that the incumbent Governor Nyesom Wike literally danced on electoral victims’ graves to the state house in Port Harcourt.</p>
      <p>But, honestly, President Muhammadu Buhari has a lot of work to do to bequeath a better electoral legacy to his successors. The election that brought him in in 2015 was by far better than what we witnessed in Bayelsa and Kogi states.  His anti-corruption war has not made a dent on political corruption as yet. Yet, corruption is not about money or financial issues alone. When people cannot decide their leaders through the ballot box in a democracy because some people have decided to bastardise the process, it is a graver form of corruption. Indeed, there would be less dissipation of energy on fighting economic corruption when elections reflect the will of the people because political leaders would mind their actions, knowing full well that they would return to the people for revalidation of their tenure.</p>
