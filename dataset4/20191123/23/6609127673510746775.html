        <b>ELITE cops may have torched files to cover up misuse of cash, a new report claims.</b>

      <p>Officers had documents burned just before a probe into their unit began.</p>

      <p>Now investigators say the actions by members of the now-defunct Scottish Crime and Drugs Enforcement Agency raise “doubt” over their motives.</p>
      <p>Met detectives were brought in to review an earlier inquiry into claims SCDEA chiefs had mismanaged thousands of pounds.</p>
      <p>The initial probe claimed “the documents incinerated were not detrimental to the investigation nor did they relate to any financial irregularities”.</p>

      <p>But the Met’s report found that the timing so close “to a professional standards investigation” and “lack of any record of destruction throws sufficient doubt that this can be the only conclusion”.</p>
      <p>It went on to say one SCDEA cop used funds to play golf and visit Northern Ireland “for false reasons”. A female officer said she was told to burn a pile of documents outside its Paisley HQ.</p>
      <p>The SCDEA, set up to fight crime gangs, was axed in 2013.</p>
      <p>Police Scotland said last night: “The Metropolitan Police Service concluded that all matters from 2011 are indeed legacy-based.”</p>
      <p>The Scottish Police Authority said changes have been made to how archives are managed.</p>
