      <p>HUBER HEIGHTS — Three boys said three strangers tried to lure them into a car Thursday afternoon at Wright Brothers Elementary School in Huber Heights.</p>
      <p>The children said it happened as they headed home after school.</p>
      <p>“The guy in the back seat was trying to call him over to the car, for who knows what reason,” said Donald Mennenhall, the children’s grandfather. “They didn’t have any business doing that; it really alarmed me.”</p>
      <p>Huber Heights police Lt. Tony Ashley said the school’s principal called the department Friday morning to report what happened.</p>
      <p>“It’s extremely important we get a phone call when it happens to do our best to try and get involved in the situation as soon as possible,” he said.</p>
      <p>Ashley said school resource officers in the district were made aware of the incident, and that police will have extra patrols to make sure children stay safe.</p>
      <p>The department does not get many calls like this one, but the lieutenant said it should serve as a reminder to talk to children about what do to when a stranger tries to talk to them.</p>
      <p>“Parents definitely need to talk to their kids, explain that things don’t seem right , trust their gut feeling and do what they’re supposed to do,” Ashley said.</p>
      <p>Mennenhall said he has had that talk with his grandchildren many times, and he said that’s why they kept on walking and told their parents about it.</p>
      <p>To the trio in the car, Mennenhall has these words: It “needs to stop because they’re going to get into some trouble, one way or another.”</p>
