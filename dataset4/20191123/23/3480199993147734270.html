      <p>Jacqueline Jossa burst into tears when she learned she had been chosen to do the next Bushtucker Trial in I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here!.</p>
      <p>The ex-EastEnders star was voted by the public to do the trial, along with former footballer Ian Wright.</p>
      <p>The celebrities learned of their fate from hosts Ant and Dec during the live portion of Saturday’s episode of the jungle-based show.</p>

      <p>Jossa, 27, put her head in her hands as she cried, and said: “I don’t want to do anymore man.”</p>
      <p>Called the Crevice of Cruelty, Jossa and Wright will have to complete the challenge in an underground cavern.</p>
      <p>The trial will air live on Sunday’s show.</p>
      <p>Jossa was previously chosen in a public vote to face a trial called Snake Hotel, where she and Myles Stephenson had 10 minutes to hunt down stars hidden inside a snake-infested building.</p>
      <p>The soap star, best known for playing Lauren Branning in EastEnders, has also had to join in a handful of other compulsory challenges along with her campmates, including one called Face Your Fear.</p>
      <p>She had to put her head into a clear helmet filled with spiders, the critters chosen for her by viewers.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the episode, Jossa shed tears when receiving her luxury item of a pillow printed with pictures of her children.</p>

      <p>Jossa – who has daughters Ella, four, and Mia, one, with husband Dan Osborne – said: “I just want to cuddle them so badly, I just want to give them a cuddle and a kiss.”</p>
      <p>She and some of her co-stars were given their luxury items after eating a special dinner won from their group trial.</p>
      <p>Radio DJ Roman Kemp received a mug with his girlfriend’s face printed on it, and former EastEnders star Cliff Parisi was given his Christmas tree.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s episode also saw one of the most gruesome tasks of the series so far.</p>
      <p>The 12 campers had to face a stomach-churning trial, in which some of them had to hold critters in their mouths to free their co-stars from a jungle jail.</p>
      <p>The challenge saw Wright gingerly hold a huntsman spider between his lips for one minute and Kemp keep a scorpion in his mouth.</p>
      <p>The second part of the trial, dubbed The Pest Office, saw others have to eat a jungle “delicacy” if their name was pulled from a hat.</p>

      <p>James Haskell and Caitlyn Jenner were the first to be picked, and they each had to eat a cow’s eye.</p>
      <p>Nadine Coyle and Adele Roberts were then picked to eat a cow’s anus, both of them retching and struggling but ultimately succeeding.</p>
      <p>The trial was a success as the celebrities won 12 out of 12 stars, meaning they won a full feast to eat back at camp.</p>
      <p>Haskell was voted as camp leader by his campmates in the episode, and he picked Jossa to be his deputy.</p>
      <p>I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! continues on ITV.</p>
