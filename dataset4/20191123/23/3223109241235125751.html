      <h1>Adidas Jumps To Hyperspace With Their Newest Star Wars Sneakers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T23:00:25+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/tresdean/" target="_blank">Tres Dean</a></address>
      <p>Adidas came out hot earlier this month with the first wave of their <a href="https://www.geek.com/culture/adidas-unveils-full-star-wars-collection-lineup-1808935/">new Star Wars kicks</a>. The line, which drew inspiration from lightsabers, was primarily incorporated into the sneaker and apparel brand’s basketball line, seeing the signature sneakers of NBA superstars like James Harden and Damian Lillard get some slick blue, green, purple, and red colorways. It made for a strong start to the <a href="https://www.geek.com/culture/star-wars-x-adidas-basketball-shoe-collection-drops-next-month-1808201/">brand’s 2019 Star Wars line</a>, largely timed to coincide with the veritable Star Wars Season we’ve got going on right now with the release of <i>The Mandalorian</i>, <i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i>, and <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> happening in such quick succession.</p>
      <p>While they’ve yet to announce a full line of both sneakers and clothing centered around my son/best friend/Patronus/number one boy Baby Yoda (it’s gonna happen eventually, mark my words) <a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/star_wars">the newest line dropped this week</a>. If you’re a fan of adidas’ running output, you’re in for a treat with this one.</p>

      <p>The newest capsule draws inspiration from the greatest starships in a galaxy far, far away. It’s a tight little capsule made up of just three shoes, far smaller than the prior – but don’t worry, quality isn’t diminished by the quantity here.</p>

      <p>The first shoe in the line is inspired by the Rebel Alliance’s X-Wing fighters. It adorns the adidas Ultra Boost S&amp;L. <a href="https://www.geek.com/culture/star-wars-x-adidas-ultraboost-photos-have-leaked-1803964/">We reported on this one</a> a while back so you may already know the details, but in case you’re still catching up, this one is going to be rocking a gray and orange colorway inspired by the battle colors of the pilots that fly the X-Wings. It will also have glow-in-the-dark elements and be adorned with the phrases “STAY ON TARGET” and “THE FORCE WILL BE WITH YOU, ALWAYS.”</p>

      <p>On a different Ultra Boost model (this one being the Ultra Boost 2019) there will be a colorway inspired by the Millennium Falcon, ostensibly the most recognizable ship in Star Wars history. It features a metallic yarn upper with metallic elements throughout, including the heel counter and cage. These elements will meld with a gray and blue upper and will come emblazoned with the phrases, “JUMP TO LIGHTSPEED” and, of course, “NEVER TELL ME THE ODDS.” Dope.</p>

      <p>Rounding out the release is a departure from the Ultra Boost line. The adidas Alphaedge 4D shoe, which utilizes cutting-edge 3D printing to build its unique midsole, will come in a colorway inspired by the Death Star. This one is a bit more subtle. The shoe’s midsole will still be in the 4D line’s signature mint green while the upper will be a matte black. It’ll come with “THAT’S NO MOON” and “THE POWER OF THE DARK SIDE” printed on the shoe.</p>
      <p>Like we said, quantity doesn’t equal quality in all cases. The adidas Star Wars starship collection is available via the <a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/star_wars">adidas website</a> now. Catch them before everyone else who’s trying to cop a pair jumps to lightspeed and hits “Add To Cart” before you have a chance.</p>
