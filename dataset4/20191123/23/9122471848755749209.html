      <h1>Mac Jones Reveals What Tua Tagovailoa Told Him Before Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T23:47:10+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 23:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Mac Jones and the Alabama Crimson Tide had little trouble getting past Western Carolina without Tua Tagovailoa today, winning 66-3 at Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Ala.</p>
      <p>The backup to the Heisman Trophy winner made the start under center and played well. Jones threw for 275 yards on 10/12 passing with three touchdowns.</p>
      <p>Jones said that he talked to Tagovailoa following the quarterback’s season-ending surgery. He said he got some simple advice.</p>
      <p>“He said do what you do and be yourself, and everything will be fine and I wish him the best,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5b6GHVKuM8&amp;feature=youtu.be">Jones told reporters after the game</a>. “Obviously he’s a great leader for our team and look forward to him coming back and having a great recovery.”</p>
      <p>Jones added that it’s never easy to replace a player like Tagovailoa, but the Crimson Tide are built for success.</p>
      <p>“It’s not easy losing a great leader like that, but we’re built for that. We’re train every day for the whole year mentally and physically. It’s really mental toughness and learning how to respond to adversity.”</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa returned to Bryant-Denny Stadium today and received a huge ovation from the fan base. He appeared to be in good spirits.</p>
