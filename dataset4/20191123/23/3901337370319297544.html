      <p><b>Reslt:</b> Real Madrid 3-1 Real Sociedad</p>

      <p>Gareth Bale was booed with every touch by his own supporters in Real Madrid's 3-1 victory over Real Sociedad on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>Los Blancos manager Zinedine Zidane made only one enforced change from their win over Eibar before the FIFA break as Rodrygo took the place of the injured Lucas Vazquez. Meanwhile, Sociedad welcomed back centre-back Aritz Elustondo and Martin Odegaard started ahead of Adnan Januzaj against his parent club.</p>
      <p>Madrid had a horrible start after Sergio Ramos made a costly back-pass in the second minute of the match that was intercepted by Willian Jose and the Brazilian forward easily slotted past goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois..</p>
      <p>Zidane's charges took time before they could find their rhythm going froward, with the visitors effectively pressing them high but they eventually levelled matters eight minutes before the break thanks to an improvised finish from Benzema after Luka Modric delivered a delightful free-kick into the box.</p>
      <p>

      <p>That situation changed two minutes into the second stanza as Federico Valverde gave Los Blancos the lead with a thumping strike that took a deflection off Mikel Oyarzabal and left goalkeeper Alex Remiro flat-footed.</p>
      <p>Zidane was looking to kill of the match in the 67th minute as Gareth Bale came on for Rodrygo amidst the jeers and whistles.</p>
      <p>The Welshman, however, played a role in Madrid finding the third goal, as his cross was nodded into the path of Modric by Benzema, leaving the Croatian to rifle home a left-footed volley with 15 minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>The victory sees Real move level on points with league leaders FC Barcelona, who boast a superior goal difference.</p>
