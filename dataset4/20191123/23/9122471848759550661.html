      <h1>Joel Klatt: The Heisman Trophy Race Is Down To 2 Players</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T23:16:33+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 23:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Ohio State’s 28-17 win against Penn State showed the most dominant player in college football is on the defensive side of the ball. Star defensive end Chase Young finished the game with two forced fumbles, three sacks, four tackles for loss and nine tackles.</p>
      <p>Young was in the conversation for the Heisman Trophy before he missed two games while serving a suspension. His first game back could not have gone any better.</p>
      <p>After the game, college football analyst Joel Klatt made it clear that only two people can win the Heisman this season: Ohio State’s Chase Young and LSU star quarterback Joe Burrow.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never covered a more dominant player than Chase Young. Hard to describe him on the telecast…so I made up a fake comic allegiance. Heisman Trophy voters should wait until after Conference Champ games to make up their mind Burrow and Young,” Klatt said.</p>

      <p>Burrow has led the nation’s most-lethal offense all season long. He sits second in the nation in passing yards and has completed nearly 80-percent of his passes this season.</p>
      <p>The former Ohio State quarterback has 38 touchdowns passes to just six interceptions this season – with two regular season games left to play.</p>
      <p>Is this just a two-horse race?</p>
