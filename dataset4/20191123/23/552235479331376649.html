      <h2>PC Jon Snaith bragged "I can do what I want" and even encouraged members of the public to join a sex and drugs party at his home using the Grindr dating app.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T23:09:27+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 23:09</time> by <a rel="author">Rob Kennedy</a></address>
      <p>A corrupt cop has been caged after he bragged "I can do what I want" while living a "fantasy lifestyle" high on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/kids-football-coach-cocaine-dealer-20941982">cocaine</a> and using prostitutes.</p>
      <p>PC Jon Snaith became embroiled in depravity and criminality instead of fighting it while he was serving with the police.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old ignored the supply chain of those dealing in cocaine as he was snorting it while he turned a blind eye to those behind the escorts he was sleeping with.</p>
      <p>He even offered members of the public <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/kids-football-coach-cocaine-dealer-20941982">cocaine</a> on the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/kids-football-coach-cocaine-dealer-20941982">Grindr</a> dating app.</p>
      <p>During his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/kids-football-coach-cocaine-dealer-20941982">court case</a> it was heard Snaith also advised an alleged Mr Big to say nothing to cops over claims the man had been involved in human trafficking.</p>

      <p>Counter corruption officers from Northumbria Police had Snaith under surveillance and finally moved in as he was about to drive while high on cocaine, with his dealer and prostitute, Marcela Muntean, lying semi-naked in his house, along with another girl.</p>
      <p>An image on Snaith's phone showed Muntean, naked, bending over a chopping board taking drugs in his house.</p>
      <p>Now Snaith, of Felton, near Morpeth, has been jailed for two years for corruption and offering to supply drugs, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/disgrace-uniform-corrupt-pc-jailed-17302575">Chronicle Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Locking him up at Newcastle Crown Court, Recorder Jonathan Aitken said Snaith had not sold his office for gain but had "entered into a lifestyle of depravity using your own money to fund that and in the process bankrupted yourself".</p>
      <p>The judge added: "The principle aggravating factor is that you have destroyed the trust of many in the police force.</p>
      <p>"It's not simply a case of you indulging in your own fantasy lifestyle but there were risks involved.</p>
      <p>"You knew these women were strangers to the UK but <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/kids-football-coach-cocaine-dealer-20941982">single-mindedly</a> ignored that for your own satisfaction."</p>
      <p>The court heard Snaith had been a police officer for more than 20 years and was based in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/kids-football-coach-cocaine-dealer-20941982">Berwick</a> before his arrest last April following a surveillance operation by counter corruption officers.</p>
      <p>Sharon Beattie, prosecuting, said: "He admitted by his pleas he failed to report criminal conduct of others, including Marcela Muntean and associates of hers with whom he was friendly and had substantial contact during which he obtained drugs and sexual services. Muntean provided both."</p>
      <p>The police investigation showed he had been in contact with a "large number of sex workers in the North East", many believed to be from Eastern Europe.</p>
      <p>Inquiries showed he had transferred thousands of pounds to Muntean and a man referred to in court only as “A”.</p>
      <p>“A” was arrested in January last year on suspicion of human trafficking and then released on bail but Snaith remained in touch, asking <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/kids-football-coach-cocaine-dealer-20941982">“A”</a> , on the night before Snaith was arrested, if anyone could bring him drugs, discussing his arrest and advising him to say nothing to the police.</p>
      <p>Snaith then suggested “A” go to his house "for a line" and told him the police wouldn't find him when he raised fears he would be in trouble for breaching his bail conditions by going out during his curfew.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>When “A” told him "you're my friend whatever happens" Snaith said he wished he could help him.</p>
      <p>There was also a conversation between the two men about <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/kids-football-coach-cocaine-dealer-20941982">drugs and sex</a> and pictures of women were passed between them with comments.</p>
      <p>Beattie said: "This conversation indicates not only his awareness of the fact “A” was under investigation but how he was prepared to continue the association and give advice to someone who was a suspect in a criminal case and suggested he breached his bail."</p>
      <p>Snaith asked “A” to get Muntean to bring him cocaine and she arrived at 6am, along with another girl, both being driven by a man.</p>
      <p>An image later found on Snaith's phone showed Muntean "naked, bending over a chopping board, appearing to be taking drugs".</p>
      <p>It was from around 6.44am onwards that Snaith went on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/kids-football-coach-cocaine-dealer-20941982">Grindr</a> encouraging people to come to his home for sex and drugs.</p>
      <p>It was as he left his home to go to the shop that morning that the surveillance team moved in to arrest him as he was unfit to drive. He replied: "I've gone too far this time."</p>
      <p>In the house, Muntean, who was semi-naked while the other girl was upstairs, told officers: "John is a policeman, he is allowed to take drugs in his own house. All <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/kids-football-coach-cocaine-dealer-20941982">policemen take drugs</a> . I like to take drugs because it makes me feel nice."</p>
      <p>Two months before he was arrested, Snaith had done a police training course about how to spot signs of sexual exploitation, the court heard.</p>

      <p>A day later, officers trailing him saw him speaking to a group of men near his home and, as they parted, one was heard to say "You are supposed to be a policeman."</p>
      <p>Snaith replied: "I can do what I want."</p>
      <p>Beattie told the court: "He has served his own ends by failing to fulfil his duties and there is damage to public confidence as a result of this offending."</p>
      <p>Snaith pleaded guilty to police corruption over a 14-month period and offering to supply <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/kids-football-coach-cocaine-dealer-20941982">class A drugs</a> and was told he will serve up to half of the two year sentence in prison.</p>
      <p>Muntean, 31, of no fixed address, admitted supplying cocaine to Snaith and money laundering and was given 12 months suspended for 12 months with 100 hours unpaid work.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Pigford, for Snaith, said he had met Muntean through a website, adding: "It's accepted he showed no interest in the status of Muntean and other girls despite his police training and that's the height of the offending."</p>
      <p>Pigford said Snaith had separated from his partner due to his infidelity, became isolated and began misusing alcohol and cocaine to cope and for escapism.</p>
      <p>As a result of his offending, he "spiralled into debt" and was made bankrupt and has been doing labouring work after his dismissal by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/kids-football-coach-cocaine-dealer-20941982">Northumbria Police</a> .</p>
      <p>Pigford added: "The loss to him has been hugely significant. He has lost friends in the police, lost his relationship which he blames himself for,he has lost out financially and lost his pension."</p>
      <p>He said custody will be difficult for him.</p>
      <p>Paul Reid, for Muntean, said there was evidence to suggest “A” was the big boss and that Muntean had not made any money for herself.</p>
      <p>He said when she announced she wanted to go back to Romania in 2016, she was violently assaulted by those controlling her and her face was left disfigured, leaving her in hospital for up to three weeks and she still requires further surgery.</p>
      <p>Reid said: "It's a sad story of exploitation and abuse.</p>
      <p>"She's had a terrible time as a result of much higher level offending by others."</p>
      <p>He added that she was "merely a pawn” who had been "used and abused".</p>
