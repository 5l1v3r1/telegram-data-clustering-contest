      <h2>Shocking Nazi reference stuns Holland on weekend when footballers took a stand against racism following alleged abuse suffered by Excelsior striker Ahmad Mendes Moreira last weekend</h2>

      <p>Dutch legend Marco van Basten was last night involved in a race storm that has rocked Holland.</p>
      <p>Van Basten was overheard saying ‘Sieg Heil’ at the end of a TV interview with Heracles’ German manager Frank Wormuth, following their defeat to Ajax.</p>
      <p>The former Milan and Ajax striker, a pundit on Dutch TV, thought his microphone was off... but it wasn’t.</p>
      <p>Van Basten’s shocking homage to Adolf Hitler has stunned Holland.</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old was quick to apologise, saying his comment was meant as a joke about his colleague Hans Kraay's German.</p>

      <p>"It was not my intention at all to shock people. I only wanted to 'explain' Hans' German," Van Basten said.</p>
      <p>Broadcaster Fox Sports also apologised.</p>
      <p>"His comments were inappropriate. Not only for today, but for every day,' a spokesman told Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad.</p>
      <p>But the faux pas comes at the worst possible time.</p>
      <p>This weekend, Dutch football united against the deplorable racism in their game. Players around the country stood still for the first minute of all matches.</p>

      <p>The stand came in response to alleged racist abuse suffered by Excelsior Rotterdam striker Ahmad Mendes Moreira last weekend.</p>
      <p>Excelsior Rotterdam striker Moreira said he was called a "negro and cotton-picker" by fans from the beginning of last Sunday's fixture between his side and FC Den Bosch.</p>
      <p>He was escorted off the pitch by sympathetic teammates before a lengthy break, during which the match looked as though it could be abandoned.</p>
      <p>When play eventually resumed Moreira quickly provided the best response, scoring and cupping his ears in celebration.</p>

      <p>Prosecutors in Holland opened an investigation into the alleged abuse.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old led the protests against racism in football in Excelsior's game against FC Volendam on Friday night. After the game kicked off, players of both teams stood still for the opening minute of the second-tier clash.</p>
      <p>All matches across the Dutch leagues were expected to follow suit over the weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> star Gini Wijnaldum, Holland’s captain, also made a personal appeal against racism during Holland's Euro 2020 qualifier against Estonia last week.</p>
      <p>The embarrassment of the row over Van Basten now sees one of the finest footballers ever produced fighting to save his career.</p>
