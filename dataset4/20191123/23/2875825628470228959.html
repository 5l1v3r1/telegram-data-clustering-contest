      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/nadine-coyle">Nadine Coyle</a> left viewers in hysterics after she recreated <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/gillian-mckeith">Gillian McKeith</a> 's iconic fainting moment from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> 2010 during tonight's episode.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/gillian-mckeith">Girls Aloud</a> singer, 34, hilariously screamed and pretended to faint as she prepared to take on the challenge of putting live cockroaches in her mouth.</p>
      <p>The celebrities from the Jungle Jail were transferred to dingy cells in Olâ€™ Dingo town and the celebrities from Main Camp had to hold live critters in their mouths for 60 seconds to release them.</p>
      <p>As Nadine prepared to hold the cockroaches in her mouth, she joked: "What did Gillian McKeith do?</p>

      <p>"She just went like this?"- the star then flayed her arms back and screamed as she pretended to fall back and faint.</p>
      <p>Avid I'm A Celeb fans will remember the iconic moment in 2010 when Gillian famously keeled over before a live Bushtucker trial and left viewers convinced she was faking it.</p>
      <p>The I'm A Celeb medic even had to come in to help Gillian recover from the traumatic experience.</p>
      <p>Nadine then impressively held the six cockroaches in her mouth for one minute and danced around while the rest of her campmates enthusiastically cheered her on.</p>
      <p>After successfully completing one part of the trial, she sarcastically told the presenting duo: "It felt hilarious Ant and Dec - you should give it a go sometime."</p>

      <p>Earlier in tonight's episode, Nadine had viewers laughing once again after she left her underwear on the floor, leaving camp leader James Haskell to find them.</p>
      <p>Confessing that the item was hers, sheepish Nadine admitted: "This is my face cloth, they were my pants."</p>
      <p>The episode also saw Nadine and Adele Roberts eat a cow's anus during the second part of the trial.</p>
      <p>The singer chewed and retched but got it down; while Adele asked everyone to sing to encourage her and again ate the cow's anus meaning the campmates won 12 out of 12 stars.</p>

      <p>Nadine has already had her fair share of jungle drama during the first week of the series.</p>
      <p>She has already opened up about her Girls Aloud bandmates, taught a routine to one of the girl band's popular tracks and refused to put her name forward to go to the Jungle Jailhouse.</p>
