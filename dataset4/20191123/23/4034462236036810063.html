      <p>It's a tradition in the MotoGP motorcycle racing series that the rider who posts the fastest qualifying time in each season is awarded with a free high-performance BMW M car. This year, that honor once again went to Marc Marquez for the seventh year in a row, who secured the MotoGP championship for the sixth consecutive year.</p>
      <p>Last year, the Spanish MotoGP champion was given a free <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/m3-cs">BMW M3 CS</a>, but this year's prize was a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/x4-m">2019 BMW X4 M </a>Competition finished in Toronto Red Metallic. Under the hood, the BMW X4 M features a 3.0-liter twin-turbo inline-six engine pumping out 510 horsepower and 442 lb-ft of torque, allowing the sporty SUV to sprint from 0-62 mph in 4.1 seconds.</p>

      <p>The high-performance SUV was presented to Marquez in Valencia by Carmelo Ezpeleta, CEO of MotoGP commercial rights holder Dorna Sports, Markus Flasch, CEO of BMW M GmbH, and Manuel Terroba, CEO of BMW Group Spain and Portugal.</p>
      <p>"I would like to thank BMW M GmbH for the great way in which they have recognises our performances at the track for many years, and how they reward the season's best qualifier," said Marquez. "I am a bit speechless to have received this award for the seventh year in a row. I am delighted to have been the fastest qualifier this year because it's not been easy and can hardly wait to get in the car."</p>

      <p>"It has pretty much become a tradition to present Marc Marquez with the BMW M Award here in Valencia," said Markus Flasch, CEO of BMW M. "To win this coveted award seven times in a row, and in such a high-class field as the one in MotoGP, is an outstanding and unique achievement. Congratulations on this record run, which started back in 2013.

We hope he has a lot of fun driving it."</p>
