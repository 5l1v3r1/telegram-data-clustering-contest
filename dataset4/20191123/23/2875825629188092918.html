      <p>The former TOWIE star slipped into a pink tracksuit and snapped a mirror selfie to reveal her slimmer frame.</p>
      <p>The GC has been open about her use of Skinny Jab injections, saying they've helped her shed pounds alongside a healthy diet and plenty of exercise.</p>
      <p>Proudly showing off the results, she said: "After the numerous temptations on my holiday to Dubai a few weeks back, I've been desperate to get back on track with me weight ever since!</p>
      <p>"Which is why I'm back on the @skinnyjab programme and feeling more determined than ever to stay in shape!</p>

      <p>"Caroline and the team always knows exactly how to keep me motivated and healthy - I can't thank them enough!"</p>
      <p>Gemma's Dubai trip saw her get back together with on-off boyfriend James 'Arg' Argent following their most recent split.</p>
      <p>It's said they've made a bizarre baby pact after reconciling their differences.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://heatworld.com/">Heat</a> magazine, The GC, 38, has vowed to have a child with her back-on beau, 31, within the next couple of years but plans to have fun until he is fully 'back on his feet'.</p>

      <p>The insider revealed: "Gemma's convinced that she's going to be a mother in the next couple of years, and she can't imagine having a baby with anyone other than Arg.</p>
      <p>"But she's keen for him to sort himself out before settling down, so in the meantime, she's looking for some fun and attention."</p>
      <p>Gemma and Arg were spotted looking more loved-up than ever in Dubai after rekindling their romance.</p>
      <p>They've split and got back together numerous times in the past.</p>

      <p>Their most recent split came after Gemma called 999 over fears that James had overdosed.</p>
      <p>Speaking out about the incident recently, Arg told <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/james-argent-overdose-gemma-collins-20730191">OK! magazine</a> : "Gemma loves me to death. She was seriously concerned because she couldn’t get hold of me, which I understand.</p>
      <p>"I didn’t have my phone on me because it was charging downstairs. I have put her through a lot so I completely understand her worry. She remembers what she’s been through in the past with me so she thought the worst."</p>
