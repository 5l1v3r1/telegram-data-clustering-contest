      <h1>It’s impossible for older women to find love in this NYC neighborhood</h1>

      <p>Looking for a single, straight, older man in New York City? Skip the West Village.</p>
      <p>Sosi Setian, a 76-year-old divorcée, has pretty much given up on finding love in the area, where she’s lived for the past eight years.</p>
      <p>“I’d prefer someone who lives in my neighborhood — it’s more convenient — but there’s not a lot of single men my age,” Setian told The Post.</p>
      <p>Turns out she’s right. According to <a href="https://www.zip-codes.com/zip-code/10014/zip-code-10014-2010-census.asp">Zip-Codes.com</a>, men between the ages of 65 and 70 make up only 2.1% of the population in the West Village, and men 70 to 74 are a scant 1.4%. The median age for males in the 10014 ZIP code is 38.9. Statistics on older women living in the West Village aren’t much better. But, Setian notes, “The few [men] there are might be gay or married, so that lessens my chances even more.”</p>
      <p>The semi-retired business owner, originally from Bulgaria, added: “A few friends have set me up with men who live in different parts of the city, but we didn’t connect, I’m not into dating apps.”</p>
      <p>It’s the same story for Ann O’Brien, 66. She discovered the lack of older men in the West Village when her long-term relationship ended several years ago.</p>
      <p>“The West Village is the best neighborhood — but romantic prospects, forget it,” O’Brien, a retired textile worker, told The Post. “As you get older, there are fewer men around . . . and the West Village is a mecca for gay men.”</p>
      <p>There’s also the issue of seniors fleeing. A study from <a href="https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/life-events/most-popular-retirement-destinations-for-seniors/">MagnifyMoney.com</a> showed that some 33,638 retirees over the age of 65 left the New York metropolitan area from 2016 to 2017. Also, women in the city have a life expectancy of 83.5 years, while it’s only 78.6 for men.</p>

      <p>“I know lots of elderly [single] women in the Village but not a correspondingly large number of elderly single men,” said Richard Blodgett, a West Village historian and board member of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation. “Maybe elderly straight men are less available because it’s easy for them to find partners among the many women.”</p>
      <p>Rather than looking for love locally, Setian has decided to settle for female friends. She posted on <a href="http://nextdoor.com/">NextDoor.com</a> looking for West Village women — 60 and older — “to meet once a week for a glass of wine, a chat, a dinner.”</p>
      <p>“I was hoping that five or six women would respond,” Setian said. She was taken aback when more than 200 replied.</p>
      <p>“I was shocked,” Setian, who has two grown children, told The Post. “I wasn’t expecting such an overwhelming response.”</p>
      <p>Many of the women who responded share her frustrations over the lack of available older men in the West Village — and with apps.</p>
      <p>“I tried dating sites. I like creative types, so I went out with this classical musician but all he wanted was sex. He was so single-minded,” said O’Brien, who has never been married or had children. “The profile picture he used was from the cover of his CD, but it was taken 15 years ago! He was really 70-plus — not mid-50s like he said.”</p>
      <p>She’s looking forward to Setian’s female-group meetings, which started this past week and will include weekly chats, a support group, a book club, weekly dinners and more.</p>
      <p>“It’s such a cool idea. I love the idea of getting together with a bunch of women my age and bouncing ideas off one another,” O’Brien added. “Older women are more open to fraud and we’re not that savvy so it’s important to have other women around to discuss things with.”</p>
      <p>And if they decide to seek out the city’s single men in their 60s and 70s, they should check out the Upper East Side. There, gents aged 60 to 74 make up 6.99% of the population.</p>
      <p>“I’d definitely date a man who lives on the Upper East Side, I’m not going to discriminate,” said Setian, although she has no plans to move neighborhoods. “Finding the right one is more important.”</p>
