        <i>Wang ‘William’ Liqiang, 26, is in hiding in Sydney on a tourist visa and is seeking political asylum in Australia</i>
      </p>
      <p>Chinese police claim <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/23/defecting-chinese-spy-who-revealed-espionage-in-australia-has-legitimate-claim-for-asylum-labor-says">a man seeking political asylum in Australia</a> as a former Chinese spy is a convicted fraudster.</p>
      <p>The Age and Sydney Morning Herald reported on Saturday that Wang “William” Liqiang had provided Australia’s counter-espionage agency, Asio, details of how China’s senior military intelligence officers fund and conduct political interference operations in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia.</p>
      <p>“I have personally been involved and participated in a series of espionage activities,” Wang said in a statement to Asio in October.</p>
      <p>Wang is at an undisclosed location in Sydney on a tourist visa and has told journalists he was seeking urgent protection from the Australian government, a plea he says he has made in multiple meetings with Asio.</p>
      <p>Reuters reports that police in Shanghai said Wang was a 26-year-old unemployed man from the eastern province of Fujian and was wanted in connection with a fraud case.</p>
      <p>On 10 April he went to Hong Kong carrying a fraudulent Chinese passport and Hong Kong permanent residency card, Shanghai police said. He had previously been convicted of fraud in 2016 in Fujian.</p>
      <p>The treasurer, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/josh-frydenberg">Josh Frydenberg</a>, said the matter was in the hands of appropriate law enforcement agencies and declined to comment on individual cases.</p>
      <p>“But I would say the government makes no apologies for the strong measures that we have taken to ensure that we have foreign interference laws in place, that we are resourcing our law enforcement intelligence agencies like never before,” he said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“We will always stand up for our national interests, whether it’s on matters of foreign policy, foreign investment or other related issues.”</p>
      <p>The opposition leader, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/anthony-albanese">Anthony Albanese</a>, said the revelations were a concern and was seeking a briefing with the appropriate agencies next week.</p>
      <p>“We need to make sure that Australia’s national sovereignty is protected,” he said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He said the decision to offer asylum would be up to the government but he was sympathetic to the request.</p>
      <p>“We know that he has outlined a range of activities which clearly put him in a circumstance whereby it’s a legitimate claim for asylum,” he said.</p>
      <p>The federal Liberal backbencher Andrew Hastie has called on the government to protect Liqiang.</p>
      <p>On Sunday Hastie told the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age that anyone willing to assist Australia in defending its sovereignty “deserves protection”.</p>
