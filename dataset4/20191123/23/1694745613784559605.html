      <p>Kelsea Ballerini has a fan in <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Selena-Gomez">Selena Gomez</a>. The 26-year-old country star shared her version of <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/selena-gomez-lose-you-to-love-me-billboard-hot-100-46848760">Gomez's hit single</a> "Lose You to Love Me" on Nov. 20, and got a loving response from the song's original artist. "I really love this song üñ§," Ballerini wrote on Twitter, captioning a video of her acoustic cover.</p>
      <p>Ballerini relied solely on her guitar for her stripped-down rendition. The soft, casual cover is a total one-eighty from <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/kelsea-ballerini-peoples-choice-awards-performance-video-46880800">her bold PCAs performance of "Club"</a> ‚Äî although each performance showcases her impressive talent. In fact, her take on "Lose You to Love Me" is so impressive, it got Gomez's attention. She responded with emoji, "üò≠ ‚ù§Ô∏è," to which Ballerini replied, "Soooo beautiful, sis." Hopefully we get to see these two together when they show up to the AMAs on Sunday! Keep reading to watch Ballerini's performance and see their online interaction for yourself.</p>
