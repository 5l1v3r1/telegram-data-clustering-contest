      <p>WBC heavyweight world titleholder Deontay Wilder puts his title on the line against Luis Ortiz on Saturday at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>In their first battle in March 2018, Wilder <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/28110103/inside-round-saw-luis-ortiz-nearly-stop-deontay-wilder-rock-heavyweight-division">survived a rough seventh round</a> to stop Ortiz in the 10th. The fight was so close that at the time of the stoppage, Wilder was winning by just one point on all three judges' scorecards (85-84).</p>
      <p>But before Saturday's rematch, the undercard features two title fights and a few prospects trying to make a name for themselves.</p>
      <p>In the co-main event, former featherweight world titleholder Leo Santa Cruz moves up in weight to face Miguel Flores for the vacant WBA junior lightweight title. And Brandon Figueroa, who owns the WBA "regular" junior featherweight belt, meets Julio Ceja in a 12-round battle.</p>

      <p>Welterweight Vito Mielnicki Jr. (3-0, 3 KOs), a 17-year-old from Roseland, New Jersey, who had to get a special permit to box in Nevada because of his age, knocked out Marklin Bailey (6-6, 4 KOs), 25, of Durham, North Carolina, in the second round.</p>
      <p>Mielnicki rocked him with a left hook-right hand combination and followed with a series of punches that again hurt Bailey, who is trained by former women's boxing star Christy Martin.
