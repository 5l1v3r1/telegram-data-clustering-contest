      <p>JAMAICA, Queens (WABC) -- Crews are making repairs Saturday after an LIRR train derailed in Queens late Friday night.</p>
      <p>Two cars of the 8:56 p.m. train from Penn due at Babylon at 10:11 p.m. <a href="https://abc7ny.com/two-cars-on-lirr-train-derail-in-queens-officials-report/5714409/">derailed just east of Jamaica</a> near Archer Ave and Sutphin Boulevard.</p>
      <p>There were 383 passengers on board the train at the time, according to the LIRR. Passengers had to wait more than an hour to get off the stranded train.</p>
      <p>Crews worked through the night and around the clock to get the equipment re-railed.</p>
      <p>"We do know that there is a rail that was broken," said LIRR SVP of Operations Rod Brooks. "We don't know whether that was a cause or an effect. We are just 11 hours into it, so our first priority is the safety and security of the passengers and employees, get the cars re-railed, get the infrastructure restored, restore service and then we will begin our investigative process."</p>
      <p>No injuries were reported, but there were many delays and cancellations throughout the night.</p>
      <p>Trains were running on time Saturday morning, but passengers leaving from Jamaica Station were advised they would be boarding on a different track.</p>
      <p>Track work will continue and the MTA says there will be no disruptions to Monday's rush hour commute.</p>
      <p>The MTA chairman has ordered an expedited investigation into what went wrong. That investigation is expected to take a few weeks.</p>
