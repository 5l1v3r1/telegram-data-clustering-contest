      <p>Robert Pattinson has revealed that if it wasn’t for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-potter/">Harry Potter</a>, he would not be acting today.</p>
      <p>The actor has become well known over the years for many movies roles, including Edward Cullen in the highly successful Twilight franchise, but some may remember one of his first movie roles was as Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire – the Hufflepuff who dies during the Triwizard Tournament.</p>
      <p>And now Robert has said that it was while promoting the movie in Japan, he decided he wanted to further his career as an actor.</p>
      <p>‘I wouldn’t be acting if it wasn’t for that [Harry Potter],’ he told the <a href="https://www.goldenglobes.com/articles/hfpa-conversation-robert-pattinson-mastering-his-craft">Hollywood Foreign Press Association.</a></p>
      <p>‘I remember going to Tokyo for the first time and sitting in my room, looking out over the city and being like, “How has this happened? It was really special and I really like that movie.”’</p>

      <p>The 33–year-old also recalls that working on the fourth installment in the Harry Potter franchise was a ‘really nice environment’ and that the children were treated very well.</p>
      <p>‘Even compared to movies I’ve done since, it was very protected, the way the kids were treated,’ he continued.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve watched movies where you see a kid who’s got their tutor and it doesn’t exactly seem like they’re really going to school. I mean, it’s just kind of [like] they are fulfilling a legal requirement.</p>

      <p>‘But in Harry Potter, it was like they were at school and were kind of doing work at the same time.’</p>
      <p>In the meantime, Robert is gearing up for the release of his upcoming movie, The Lighthouse, and he <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/17/robert-pattinson-cant-stop-masturbating-movies-teases-ferocious-scene-lighthouse-10938019/">recently teased a ‘ferocious’ masturbation scene for his character in the film.</a></p>
      <p>‘Well my first shot was this ferocious masturbation scene,’ he told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/movies/robert-pattinson-the-lighthouse.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=arts&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront">The New York Times.</a> ‘It’s always nice to do something massive for your opening shot, and I went really massive on the first take.’</p>
      <p>And he even added his own twist for the scene, which surprised director, Robert Eggers.</p>
      <p>‘It was a 180 from everything we’d done in rehearsal, and I could see Robert [Eggers] looking a little in shock afterward.</p>
      <p>‘But I was like, “OK, cool, I didn’t get told to stop, so I’ll keep going in that direction”. As soon as I’d done that, it was like the road started getting paved.’</p>
