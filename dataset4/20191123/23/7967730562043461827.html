      <p><b>Mombasa:</b> At least 36 people, including seven children, have been killed by landslides triggered by unusually heavy rains in northwestern Kenya, a local official says.</p>
      <p>The downpour began on Friday in West Pokot County, which borders Uganda, and worsened overnight, causing flooding and mudslides that swept away four bridges and left the worst-affected village, Muino, inaccessible by road.</p>

      <p>"We can confirm that the number of those dead has sadly reached 36. Some people who we thought were lost have been found dead," Samuel Poghisio, a senator from the county, told Reuters by phone.</p>
      <p>"More people are marooned and the entire village is at risk of being wiped out by the floods," the county's governor, John Lonyangapuo, said as he waited for a helicopter to transport him to survey the damage.</p>
      <p>He added that rescue efforts were under way in the area, where more than 500 vehicles are stuck on roads damaged by the landslides.</p>
      <p>Eleven of the people killed were in the same house, Lonyangapuo said.</p>
      <p>Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said in a statement on Saturday that he had deployed rescue personnel from various agencies including the army and the police to try to stop the "further loss of lives".</p>
      <p>Researchers have warned that warming oceans are causing unpredictable weather patterns in East Africa.</p>
      <p>Heavy rains and floods have killed more than 50 people and forced hundreds of thousands of people from their homes across East Africa, aid groups said earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Kenya is experiencing a heavier than usual rainy season, the Kenya Meteorological Department said in early November.</p>
