      <h1>Leon King in Rangers contract snub as Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea eye Ibrox starlet</h1>
      <h2>The Light Blues fear they could lose the highly-rated youngster in the same vein as Billy Gilmour.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T23:45:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 23:45</time> by <a rel="author">Scott McDermott, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-mcdermott/</a></address>
      <p>Rangers fear they could lose Ibrox starlet Leon King - in the same way <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/billy-gilmour">Billy Gilmour</a> left for Chelsea.</p>
      <p>The young defender, who doesn’t turn 16 until January, has turned down Gers’ initial offer of a first professional contract.</p>
      <p>And <i><b>Mail Sport </b></i>understands that Premier League giants Manchester City, Liverpool and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> - as well as German outfit RB Leipzig - are all monitoring his situation.</p>
      <p>Glasgow-born King is rated as one of the most prodigious talents in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> Academy and featured for their development side aged just 14.</p>
      <p>At 15, he’s currently part of Scotland’s Under-17 set-up, such is the centre-back’s huge potential.</p>
      <p>With the national team, he plays beside <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liam-morrison">Liam Morrison</a> who left Celtic for Bayern Munich in a similar move last summer.</p>

      <p>Rangers were stung in July 2017 when they couldn’t agree a professional contract with midfielder Gilmour.</p>
      <p>A year before his youth registration at Ibrox was up - similarly to the King scenario now - they agreed a fee of around £500,000 for Gilmour who left for London.</p>
      <p>He’s now part of Frank Lampard’s first team squad at Stamford Bridge and made his Premier League debut this season.</p>
      <p>King is in the same boat and Rangers are desperate to keep him at the Hummel Training Centre</p>
      <p>But after turning down the first offer of a pro deal, the likes of City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Leipzig - who’ve watched King for over a year - are ready to pounce.</p>
