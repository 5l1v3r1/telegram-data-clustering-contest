      <h1>Disabled US Army vet trapped in Bronx home because it lacks wheelchair ramp</h1>

      <p>A decorated, disabled Vietnam vet has been virtually trapped inside his Bronx apartment by a landlord too cheap to install a wheelchair ramp, according to lawsuit.</p>
      <p>When kindhearted neighbors aren’t around to lend a hand, Purple Heart recipient Robert Walker, 72, has been forced to wait hours in the cold and rain because he can’t safely navigate the four steps from the sidewalk to his first floor home.</p>
      <p>“Hell,” is how the US Army veteran describes his mobility issues, which are exacerbated by frequent medical appointments, including dialysis.</p>
      <p>The divorced father of five, who has five grandkids and three great-grandchildren, has a virtually new motorized scooter — but can barely use it because there’s no ramp to get it in and out of his one-bedroom, one-bath rent-stabilized home.</p>

      <p>So he’s stuck instead with a walker, which doesn’t aid his unsteady gait as he navigates the front entrance steps of his Beach Avenue building.</p>
      <p>“There’s no way he can do it,” said pal Wilfredo Coriano, 64, a fellow Army vet and Walker’s friend of 40 years, who helps him get around. “He can’t open the door on his own. Even that little step over here [from the sidewalk], it’s impossible for him.”</p>
      <p>Walker, a Harlem native who worked as a pipe fitter at the Brooklyn Navy Yard while holding down a part time job on a General Motors assembly line in Linden, New Jersey, has lived in the building since 1999.</p>
      <p>“At the time, I wasn’t handicapped, it was convenient for me,” he said. “After I got sick, the landlord just didn’t care.”</p>
      <p>He tried to solve the problem on his own by purchasing a portable ramp, but landlord Friedman Management Company won’t let him use it, declaring it unsafe for the building.</p>
      <p>Walker decided to sue the landlord in Manhattan Federal Court after his repeated requests for wheelchair access were allegedly ignored or refused.</p>
      <p>“He said, ‘Take me to court,’” Walker recalled of the building manager. “He told me last week, ‘You’re not going to win.’”</p>
      <p>Friedman Management Company, which did not return a message, declined to build a wheelchair ramp because of the cost, Walker claims in court papers.</p>
      <p>The lack of access makes Walker “a prisoner in his own home,” said lawyer Emily Purcell of Legal Services NYC, who called the refusal to build a ramp a “flagrant violation of city, state and federal law.”</p>

      <p>Walker, known around the neighborhood as “Pops,” wants to stay in his longtime home, where he feels, “well protected.”</p>
      <p>“I have very nice neighbors in this building, they will look out for me,” but, he said, “it’s hard. … I’m dealing with a slumlord.”</p>
