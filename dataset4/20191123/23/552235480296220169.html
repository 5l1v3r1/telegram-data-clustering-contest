      <h1>Rangers, Celtic... or Kilmarnock: Queen's Park boss Mark Roberts eyes big draw after Scottish Cup upset</h1>
      <h2>The Spiders are in the hat for this evening's fourth-round draw after stunning Queen of the South at Palmerston yesterday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T23:50:22+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 23:50</time> by <a rel="author">Colin Paterson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/colin-paterson/</a></address>
      <h3>Queen of the South 1 Queen's Park 2</h3>
      <p>Mark Roberts reckons it would be a dream end to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/queens-park-fc">Queen’s Park’s</a> Hampden history if they drew Celtic or Rangers in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/william-hill-scottish-cup">William Hill Scottish Cup</a> tonight.</p>
      <p>A first-half double from Salim Kouider-Aissa deservedly earned the Spiders a fourth-round spot yesterday while Connor Murray netted a consolation for the dismal Doonhamers.</p>
      <p>The Glasgow side will embrace a new professional era before flitting from the national stadium to Lesser Hampden at the end of next year.</p>
      <p>And delighted boss Roberts would love the club to sign off with a glamour cup clash against one of the Old Firm.</p>
      <p>The former Kilmarnock hitman said: “I’m just so happy for the guys and I thought we were excellent.</p>
      <p>“We’re a League Two club and we’re not expected to come to places like this and win. They’ve beaten Dundee United and Ayr United here.</p>
      <p>“We’re in Hampden until Christmas next year and then we’re moving into Lesser Hampden.</p>
      <p>“Rangers or Celtic at Hampden would be magic and that’s what everybody wants but I would love <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Kilmarnock</a> at home because then I could walk round!</p>
      <p>“We will let the guys enjoy this. You get lots of kicks in the b******s in football so when you do well, you’ve got to enjoy it.”</p>
      <p>The Spiders stunned Palmerston after 15 minutes when Kouider-Aissa’s glancing header from a Joffrey Lidouren free-kick found the far corner of the net.</p>
      <p>Kouider-Aissa then made it 2-0 when he slammed home a low ball back across the face of goal from Ciaran Summers.</p>
      <p>The second-half surge from the Championship side didn’t come although Murray pulled a goal back a minute into injury time.</p>
      <p>Dejected Doonhamers gaffer Allan Johnston said: “It’s a major blow to go out of the Cup so early.</p>
      <p>“We let ourselves down and we let the fans down. We can’t afford to play like that and it’s simply not good enough.”</p>
