      <p>Town were missing three of their usual back four but were more than good value for the point.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/fraizer-campbell/"><b>Fraizer Campbell</b></a> opened the scoring for the hosts but despite having chances to increase their lead, they paid the price by conceding an equaliser.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marc-roberts/"><b>Marc Roberts</b></a> was credited with the leveller but his header took a hefty deflection off team-mate <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lukas-jutkiewicz/"><b>Lukas Jutkiewicz</b></a> as it went in.</p>
      <p>Despite the late blow Cowley says his injury-hit squad did him proud.</p>
      <p>He said: "In 13 or so years in football management, after about 800-odd games, that's probably the toughest team that I've had to select.</p>
      <p>"To lose three of your back four in what is already an unbalanced squad has made it very, very difficult.</p>
      <p>"But I have to credit the players, particularly the ones playing out of position.</p>
      <p>"My over-riding feeling is I'm really proud of the players' efforts. They showed a lot of fight.</p>
      <p>"A lot of our defensive work was really good and Birmingham didn't have a lot of chances at all.</p>
      <p>"For their goal we didn't react quick enough and that was the only real clear-cut chance they had – and that's the disappointing thing."</p>
      <p>The first half didn't get going until 30 minutes had elapsed, and it was the hosts who created the better chances.</p>
      <p>Alex Pritchard's delightful centre picked out Elias Kachunga, who looked destined to score but saw his close-range header kept out by an alert stop from Blues goalkeeper Connal Trueman.</p>
      <p>Pritchard, making his first league start in three months, then saw a long-range free-kick kept out by Trueman as the half drew to a close.</p>
      <p>The hosts upped the ante after the restart and Campbell's classy finish put the hosts in front after 55 minutes.</p>
      <p>Campbell raced onto a through ball from Trevoh Chalobah and picked his spot to beat Trueman.</p>
      <p>Town had ample chances to extend their lead but they were punished 12 minutes from time after a lapse in concentration from a set-piece.</p>
      <p>Dan Crowley's free-kick picked out Roberts and his header took a deflection off Jutkiewicz on its way into the net as City sealed a point.</p>
      <p>It was a rare stalemate for the visitors – only their second in 17 Championship games this season.</p>
      <p>Blues caretaker boss Pep Clotet said: "We knew this would be a tough away fixture.</p>
      <p>"Huddersfield are a very strong team at home and they use a certain style of pressing.</p>
      <p>"But we managed to establish possession and I think the result is a fair one.</p>
      <p>"We believed in our football, went pressing and got out to the wide areas where we knew we could hurt Huddersfield.</p>
      <p>"We always stuck to our plan and it's a good point for us.</p>
      <p>"We wanted to go to the wide areas because we know that the pressing Huddersfield makes is very difficult to progress to the middle of the park.</p>
      <p>"That's why during the whole international break we worked on the ability to play with three forwards, so those wide areas were key for us."</p>
      <p>On the goal, Clotet admitted that striker Jutkiewicz was attempting to take credit for the equaliser.</p>
      <p>He added: "I think he [Lukas] is trying to claim it, but I'm not sure [if he will get it!]."</p>
