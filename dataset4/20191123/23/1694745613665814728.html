      <p>Just when you thought Hulu couldn't possibly get any more great <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Christmas-Movies-Hulu-45522289">holiday programming</a>, it's adding just a few more options. After all, Netflix isn't the only streaming service with an incredible selection of <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Christmas-Movies-Netflix-44543951">movies perfect for the season</a>. From star-studded Christmas specials to sweet <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/family/Christmas-Movies-Kids-Netflix-45396668">family-friendly films</a>, the service is providing even more selections in December, just in case you've run out of options (though, TBH, we'd be impressed if you made it through all the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/christmas-movies-streaming-46782801">holiday flicks available to stream</a> right now). Hulu is the gift that keeps on giving, and here are its last few gifts for you to enjoy this holiday season.</p>
