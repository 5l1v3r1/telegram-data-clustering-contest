      <h1>Man arrested after Jewish children verbally abused on London underground</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T23:38:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 23:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-reporters/" target="_blank">Telegraph Reporters</a></address>
      <p>A man has been arrested after anti-Semitic abuse was directed towards Jewish children on the London Underground.</p>
      <p>The suspect, whose name and age has not been released by police, was held in Birmingham on Saturday night on suspicion of committing a racially aggravated public order offence and he remains in custody.</p>
      <p>His arrest came after a man was filmed reading anti-Jewish passages to two young boys in skullcaps while they were travelling with their family on the Northern Line.</p>
      <p>Wearing a cap and hoodie, the man is seen in the video threatening a man off-camera after he tries to intervene before a woman in a hijab - Asma Shuweikh - confronts him.</p>
      <p>The mother-of-two, from London, told the PA news agency she "wouldn't hesitate to do it again".</p>
      <p>"I would have loved more people to come up and say something, because if everyone did, I do not think it would have escalated in the way that it did," she said.</p>
      <p>She said when she saw what was happening she knew she "had to confront him".</p>
      <p>"Being a mother-of-two, I know what it's like to be in that situation and I would want someone to help if I was in that situation," she said.</p>

      <p>She said the couple was travelling with three children, and she wanted to deflect the man's attention away from them.</p>
      <p>She said: "He was quite aggressive and was getting in my face."</p>
      <p>Fellow commuter Chris Atkins took the video after catching the Tube heading south on the Charing Cross branch of the line at midday on Friday.</p>
      <p>"The Muslim woman didn't take any shit from him and really, really took him to task, very firmly and persistently," Mr Atkins said.</p>
      <p>"In this day and age we are told how intolerant everyone is and all religions hate each other and there you had a Muslim woman sticking up for some Jewish children."</p>
      <p>Twitter users hailed Mrs Shuweikh a "hero".</p>
      <p>Mrs Shuweikh said she got off the Tube after two stops and did not realise the video was going viral until a friend texted her to say she had seen her on Twitter.</p>
      <p>She created a Twitter account so she could see the reaction.</p>
      <p>She said: "It was so heartwarming to see the responses and see what people were saying. I can't take all the credit because a lot of other people were involved.</p>
      <p>"I would not hesitate to do it again."</p>
