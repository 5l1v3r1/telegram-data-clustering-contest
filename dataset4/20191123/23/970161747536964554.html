      <p>A pet owner died from a rare bacterial infection that rotted his skin after being licked by his dog.</p>
      <p>The previously healthy 63-year-old spent more than a fortnight in hospital as he developed pneumonia, gangrene and fungal infections in his lungs, brought on by a destructive bug in the animal’s saliva.</p>
      <p>The man, who has not been identified, was infected with Capnocytophaga canimorsus. The bacteria is normally transmitted through dog bites but confounded doctors when it was contracted by a simple lick.</p>
      <p>He had already developed severe sepsis before starting medical treatment.</p>
      <p>The shocking death prompted doctors to recommend pet owners with flu-like symptoms which ‘exceed those of a simple viral infection’ to seek immediate help.</p>
      <p>His illness, first reported in a medical journal by doctors from Rote Kreuz Krankenhaus in Bremen, has caused surprise as there was no sign of an open wound which would have been expected in a serious infection.</p>

      <p>Licking would only be expected to transmit small numbers of bacteria of the bug that only affects one in every 1.5 million people, according to a Dutch study. It kills about a third of those infected.</p>

      <p>The man’s condition deteriorated in hospital, first with a rash then with nerve pain and bruises. His organs soon began to shut down, his blood clotted and skin rotted away, before he suffered a heart attack.</p>
      <p>He was resuscitated but developed a fungal infection in his lungs and blisters across his entire body. Scans found fluid build up in his brain.</p>
      <p>Sixteen days after being admitted to hospital, and having contracted MRSA, doctors and family turned off his life support.</p>
