      <h1>Tom Herman Is Under Fire For Texas’ Performance vs. Baylor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T23:23:42+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 23:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Tom Herman and the Texas Longhorns are currently staring down a 5-loss season, as they’re getting blown out by No. 13 Baylor in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>This was supposed to be a step-up season for Texas. The Longhorns opened the year with legitimate Big 12 title and College Football Playoff hopes.</p>
      <p>Texas has since gone on to lose four of its first 10 games. A fifth loss is coming this evening.</p>
      <p>Herman was viewed as a great hire for a Texas program in need of a boost back to the nationally elite level. The Longhorns went 10-4 last season, finishing the year with a Sugar Bowl win vs. Georgia. Quarterback Sam Ehlinger told the fan base Texas was “back.”</p>
      <p>Now, the fan base is growing impatient.</p>
      <p>“Herman has always had the benefit of the doubt because he never got blown out like Charlie Strong. Well — he’s getting blown out today,” one fan wrote.</p>

      <p>Herman will almost certainly get another year or two at Texas, but it’s obvious that he’s starting lose some of the Longhorns’ fan base.</p>
      <p>Texas will finish the regular season next week against Texas Tech. The Longhorns should win that one, finishing the regular season at a highly disappointing 7-5.</p>
