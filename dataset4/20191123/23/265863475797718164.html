      <h1>Cardi B And Offset’s Daughter Kulture Shows Off Her Dance Moves In New Cute Video – Check It Out!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T23:46:30+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 23:46</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Mitchell</a></address>
      <p>Cardi B’s cute daughter is already showing signs that she has inherited some of her talent and passion for music and performing – or at least for partying – since it’s hard to tell at this point. Either way, the proud mom took to social media to show Kulture dancing her little butt off to her mom Cardi and dad, Offset’s collab song, Clout!</p>
      <p>At this point, there is no secret that Kulture is a big fan of her parents’ music but it’s always fun to see her moving to the beat and enjoying it so much that she’s smiling from ear to ear.</p>
      <p>This new video that Cardi shared with the world was no exception!</p>
      <p>Kulture showed off her smooth dance moves as her mother kept on cheering on her and laughing which also made the 17 month old’s face light up.</p>
      <p>She’s definitely heard her parents’ song many times judging by her cute toothy grin as she listens to her dad spit some bars.</p>
      <p>The child can be seen moving her arms back and forth and bouncing her knees as well, keeping up with the rhythm quite well.</p>

      <p>This also acts as an update on her growing up process since this is the second time Cardi posts a clip of her baby girl dancing to the same song, the first being back in September.</p>
      <p>At the time, however, she could barely walk so it’s obvious she’d done a lot of growing up and she’s also much more coordinated now, just two months later!</p>
      <p>The only thing that hasn’t changed is how much little Kulture enjoys this song! She is also just as adorable!</p>
