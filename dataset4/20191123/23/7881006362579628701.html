      <p><b>Chennai: </b>The DMK president on Saturday condemned what he termed the BJP's 'sleight of hand' that brought back Sri Devendra Fadnavas of the saffron party as Chief Minister of Maharashtra and Sri Ajit Pawar of NCP as Deputy Chief Minister, in a dramatic turn of events this morning.</p>
      <p>"The political drama in Maharashtra is disgusting; what does one say of it, uncivil, ugly and to compare it with what," Stalin said in a social media post on the latest developments there.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Considering the "intensity" of the hard bargain driven in Maharashtra, even to call it a 'murder of democracy' may be an understatement of what happened, Stalin observed, adding, "this is how it makes us think".</p>
      <p>Stalin alleged that the Maharashtra Governor had been reduced to a 'puppet' with strings pulled from New Delhi. "Constitutional principles have been trampled upon and flung into the wastepaper basket," Stalin regretted.</p>
      <p>Eventually one hears "even threats" were used to bring about this political change and what was one to make of this style of politics, the DMK leader posed. "The face of Indian democracy has been blackened today, this is highly shameful and a demeaning act," Mr. Stalin added.</p>
