      <p>What’s in a name?</p>
      <p>Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has at least four women in mind as potential running mates — but had a hard time remembering their names when an Iowa voter asked him Friday who he would choose.</p>
      <p>“You. Are you available?” the former vice president <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/11/22/joe-biden-possible-vice-president-stacey-abrams-sally-yates/4276980002/">joked to a woman in Winterset, Iowa</a>, the Des Moines Register reported.</p>
      <p>Biden then ran through a list of four prominent Democrats — without using any of their names.</p>
      <p>“The former assistant attorney general who got fired who was just in Delaware,” he began, an <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/biden-says-sally-yates-could-be-his-vice-presidential-pick">apparent reference to Sally Yates</a>, who President Trump fired in 2017 when she refused to enforce his travel ban.</p>
      <p>“The leader of the, uh, the woman who should’ve been the governor of Georgia, the African American woman,” he continued — meaning Stacey Abrams, who lost a governor’s race in 2018.</p>
      <p>“The two senators from the state of New Hampshire,” he concluded. That would be Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan.</p>
      <p>Abrams, who was touted as a potential presidential candidate but declined to run, is widely seen as a top veep prospect in 2020. Yates, Shaheen, and Hassan have not been cited as potential running mates before now.</p>
      <p>“I mean, there’s an enormous number of qualified people,” Biden said.</p>
