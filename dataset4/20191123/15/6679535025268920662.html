      <h2>‘Shiv Sena’s conspiracy against BJP fell through’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:55:43+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/V-Raghavendra-848/" target="_blank">V. Raghavendra</a></address>
      <p>The BJP leaders, led by their national organising secretary V. Satish and Mahila Morcha in-charge Daggubati Purandeswari, have celebrated the formation of their government in Maharashtra by distributing sweets and bursting crackers here.</p>
      <p>Addressing the gathering on Saturday, Ms. Purandeswari said people had given majority seats in the Maharashtra Assembly to the BJP with the hope that it would deliver good governance.</p>
      <p>She conveyed her best wishes to Devendra Fadnavis for staging a comeback as the Chief Minister, and pointed out that the Shiv Sena had tried to deceive the BJP but its conspiracy fell through.</p>
      <p>MLCs P.V.N. Madhav and Somu Veerraju said it was unfortunate that the Shiv Sena attempted to pull off a coup by forging an “opportunistic alliance” with the Congress due to its “lust for power.”</p>
      <p>BJP State organising secretary G. Madhukar, former MP K. Haribabu, former Ministers P. Manikyala Rao and Ravela Kishore Babu, and party State vice-president T. Nagabhushanam were present.</p>
