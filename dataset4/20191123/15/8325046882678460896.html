      <p>Disney Plus has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus-mandalorian-one-of-biggest-streaming-shows-of-year-2019-11">entered the streaming war with its live-action “Star Wars” series,</a> “The Mandalorian.”</p>
      <p>Every week, Parrot Analytics provides Business Insider with a list of the nine most in-demand TV shows on streaming services in the US. The data is based on “<a href="https://support.parrotanalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/222663987-TV-demand-measurement-What-are-Demand-Expressions-">demand expressions</a>,” Parrot Analytics’ globally standardized TV demand measurement unit. Audience demand reflects the desire, engagement, and viewership weighted by importance, so a stream or download is a higher expression of demand than a “like” or comment on social media, for instance.</p>
