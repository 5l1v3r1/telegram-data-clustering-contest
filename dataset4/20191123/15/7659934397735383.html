      <p>Libya´s coast guard says it has intercepted 284 Europe-bound migrants off the country´s Mediterranean coast.<br/><br/>Saturday´s statement says the migrants were intercepted in four separate operations off the coastal towns of Zawya, Garabulli and Abu-Kemmash, and the city of Tripoli. The four boats were stopped Wednesday.<br/><br/>The statement says the migrants were handed over to authorities in Tripoli and were taken to detention centers.<br/><br/>Libya has emerged as a major transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty to Europe. In recent years, the EU has partnered with Libya´s coast guard and other local groups to stem the dangerous sea crossings.<br/><br/>Rights groups, however, say those policies leave migrants at the mercy of armed groups or confined in squalid detention centers rife with abuses.</p>
