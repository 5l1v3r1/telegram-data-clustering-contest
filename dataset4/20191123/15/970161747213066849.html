      <p>A convicted murderer throttled a mum-of-two, just weeks after convincing the Parole Board he was safe to be on the streets.</p>
      <p>‘Exceptionally dangerous killer’ Donald Sheridan, who has a fetish for tights, was released from prison on licence in May and targeted his victim on June 2.</p>
      <p>He forced her to put on two pairs of tights and strangled her as she begged for her life in Leeds city centre.</p>
      <p>Sheridan, 55, was given a life sentence in 1986 for the sexually-motivated murder of a 67-year-old woman in South Wales.</p>
      <p>He had kicked and punched the pensioner to death, whose body was found wearing only her underwear and tights.</p>

      <p>But he recently convinced the Parole Board he was safe to be returned to the community.</p>
      <p>Weeks after his release, he waited for her near a disused railway bridge as walked home from the gym and dragged her into the bushes, choked her and demanded money.</p>
      <p>The mum described how Sheridan smelt strongly of alcohol and forced her to koss him.</p>
      <p>She told her she had children and said: ‘Don’t kill me,’ Leeds Crown Court heard.</p>
      <p>The woman was then ordered to remove her leggings and underwear before being made to wear two pairs of rights Sheridan had bought with him.</p>
      <p>The creep told the woman to perform a sex act on him but the attack ended when he was disturbed by people walking dogs nearby.</p>

      <p>He let the woman go and told her: ‘Can you please not tell anyone.’</p>
      <p>Sheridan was arrested that evening, having breached his curfew by returning drunk to the hostel at Holbeck House at 10.30pm.</p>
      <p>The victim reported the incident to the police and a pair of rights containing the predator’s DNA were recovered from the scene.</p>
      <p>Michael Morley, prosecuting, told the court Sheridan went on to make a series of ‘concerning admissions’.</p>
      <p>The lawyer added: ‘He said women in their 60s and 70s were more his type.’</p>

      <p>Mr Morley said Sheridan admitted he would have raped and killed his latest victim if she were in that age bracket.</p>
      <p>The defendant told police he had been going into Leeds to identify ‘potential victims’ and admitted to following an elderly woman around the city centre and watching her all afternoon as she went to a betting shop.</p>
      <p>He also admitted lying to the Parole Board at his hearing in order to be released and said he continued to have urges to harm both men and women.</p>
      <p>Recalling his attack on the woman, Sheridan said: ‘I couldn’t help myself.’</p>
      <p>He went on to admit he had a fetish for elderly females and tights since he had seen a naked nun when he was in care as a child.</p>
      <p>Sheridan said he had stolen her tights and then wore them to bed.</p>
      <p>The defendant said he had taken some with him to his latest offence as they were a ‘comfort blanket’.</p>
      <p>After he was arrested Sheridan attacked a female dock officer when he appeared before Leeds Magistrates Court, West Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>He grabbed her by the neck as he was being returned to his cell and put his tongue in her mouth.</p>
      <p>The court heard how the officer was off work for three months after the incident as she was so traumatised.</p>
      <p>Sheridan pleaded guilty to robbery, false imprisonment, committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.</p>

      <p>He had previously been released from custody after a Parole Board hearing in 2001 but was later recalled to prison.</p>
      <p>Judge Rodney Jameson, QC, gave Sheridan a life sentence for his latest offence and imposed a minimum term of five-and-a-half years.</p>
      <p>But the judge told the court it was likely that Sheridan would never be released from prison.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘He is a man with quite exceptional dangerousness.</p>
      <p>‘I can’t see circumstances in which it will ever be safe to release him until he is so enfeebled by age that he is no longer able to pose a danger.’</p>
