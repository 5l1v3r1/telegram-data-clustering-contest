      <p>The Kahuku Red Raiders will make a record 13th appearance in a state football championship game.</p>
      <p>Running back Zealand Matagi rushed for 133 yards and scored two touchdowns in the third quarter to help the Red Raiders rally from a surprising halftime deficit to beat Campbell 21-19 in the Open Division semifinals of the First Hawaiian Bank/HHSAA Football State Championships tonight at Aloha Stadium.</p>
      <p>OIA champion Kahuku (9-3) is 8-4 in state title games since the first tournament was held in 1999 and will play the winner of tonight’s second semifinal between Mililani and Saint Louis next Friday for the championship.</p>
      <p>Matagi needed 30 carries and help from his defense to survive against the Sabers (6-6), who had lost two games earlier this season to Kahuku by a combined score of 81-7.</p>

      <p>After Matagi’s two TD runs put Kahuku ahead 21-13, Campbell’s Blesyng Alualu-Tuiolemotu blocked a Kahuku punt midway through the fourth quarter to give the Sabers the ball inside the Kahuku 20.</p>
      <p>On fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line, Campbell quarterback Blaine Hipa tried to trick Kahuku by going quick on a quarterback sneak but was stopped short of the goal line with 3:16 remaining.</p>
      <p>The Sabers forced a three-and-out without any timeouts remaining and got the ball back on the Kahuku 42 with 1:03 remaining. Hipa completed a pass to Titus Mokiao-Atimalala on fourth-and-7 to put the ball on the Kahuku 24 with 22 seconds remaining and then caught a 24-yard TD pass with 16 seconds remaining to pull within 21-19.</p>
      <p>Hipa’s two-point conversion pass to Mokiao-Atimalala was tipped just enough by Kahuku’s Tomasi Pasi to keep it from being caught.</p>
      <p>Campbell’s Tamatoa Mokiao-Atimalala recovered the onside kick and Campbell had two plays left, but Hipa was sacked by Kahuku’s Zion Ah You to end it.</p>
      <p>Ah You finished with 2 1/2 sacks and scored the game’s first touchdown on a 2-yard run.</p>
