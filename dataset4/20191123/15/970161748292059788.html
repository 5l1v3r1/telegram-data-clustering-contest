      <p>Kylie Jenner reportedly only sees Drake occasionally after facing speculation about the pair of them <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a>.</p>
      <p>The makeup mogul, who shares baby Stormi with Travis, previously faced rumours that she was dating the God’s Plan hitmaker.</p>
      <p>However, a source <a href="https://people.com/tv/kylie-jenner-drake-doesnt-seem-serious/">told PEOPLE</a> that the apparent romance ‘doesn’t seem serious’.</p>
      <p>‘Kylie doesn’t seem to be dating,’ they said. ‘She sees Drake occasionally, but it doesn’t seem serious.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, other reports have suggested that ‘she could be doing it just to make Travis jealous.’</p>

      <p>It was previously reported <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/kylie-jenner-drake-spending-time-together-travis-scott-split-close-family-11048526/">that the pair are ‘spending time together.’</a></p>
      <p>One source <a href="https://people.com/tv/kylie-jenner-drake-spending-romantic-time-together/">told People</a>: ‘He and Kylie have been spending time together recently.</p>
      <p>‘They’ve been friends for a long time and Drake is very close to the family.’</p>
      <p>Although some describe their relationship as ‘friendly’, another source claims Kylie and Drake are spending time together ‘romantically’.</p>

      <p>It’s alleged that Drake sees a potential romance with the cosmetics mogul, but she’s said to only see him as a friend.</p>
      <p>However, in an interview around the same time, the singer described himself as a Kardashian/Jenner family friend, and even classed momager Kris Jenner as his favourite.</p>
      <p>Really, who can blame him?</p>
      <p>It was also said that Travis <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/26/travis-scott-feel-betrayed-kylie-jenner-hooked-drake-10986403/">would feel betrayed if Drake and Kylie were to get together after their split earlier this year.</a></p>

      <p>After additional comments from another source claims the duo ‘had an attraction’, <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/10/25/travis-scott-feelings-kylie-jenner-drake-potentially-dating-details/">Hollywood Life reports</a> that Travis is less than impressed by the whispers he’s been hearing.</p>
      <p>‘He would feel a bit betrayed if Drake started anything with Kylie that was anything romantic,’ the insider explained.</p>
      <p>‘Travis considers Drake a good friend. He trusts that it was just a fun night out and nothing more happened and people are just overshooting their expectations on this potential relationship.’</p>
      <p>Since their split, Travis and Kylie have been focused on co-parenting baby Stormi, giving their little girl a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/18/kylie-jenner-and-travis-scott-take-daughter-stormi-to-pumpkin-patch-as-two-handle-co-parenting-really-well-10939939/">cracking Halloween as they took her to a pumpkin patch.</a></p>
