      <h1>Every word Manuel Pellegrini just said as West Ham boss refuses to discuss calamitous Roberto</h1>
      <h2>Pellegrini was asked three times about Roberto but said nothing after the Hammers were beaten by Spurs</h2>

        <b>Michail Antonio a positive?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, we he worked all week but couldn't start this game and hasn't played for three months He showed he was ready and played well.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What went wrong?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Firstly we are playing under big pressure we do not have the results that we want, especially here at home. This is a special game against Tottenham, we wanted to do it better but we couldn't.</p>
      <p>I think the team didn't give up, they fought until the end, trying always to draw but we are making too many mistakes without the ball.</p>
      <p>Every time we are making mistakes, they are scoring.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Is the problem with the players or is it with you?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I think that it is both.</p>
      <p>Both are together the manager and the players. Both have the responsibility to make sure the team plays well, to win game,s have good results, you cannot separate one from the other.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Are you happy with your goalkeeper?</b>
      </p>

      <p>I don't want to talk about Roberto or individual performance.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Is he your best option?</b>
      </p>
      <p>If he is playing it is because he is.</p>
      <p>
        <b>It's the third week running you've not spoken about him despite his errors?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I said about Antonio because he's coming back from injury.</p>
      <p>I think that you are in charge to see which players are playing well at that time, it is the responsibility of the manager, not things for the media.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Two points in the last 21 available, do you need to re-assess your target?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We need to try to win the next game.</p>
      <p>When we win, the media asked me the same question how high we will finish. We must win the next game. This is not the result we have expected, especially at home, it is very tight this season and if we were three points more we would be further up the table.</p>
      <p>We need to improve in both defending andattacking.</p>
