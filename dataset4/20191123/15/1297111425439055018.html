      <h1>Mandryk: Moe's kind words for Freeland a hopeful sign of détente</h1>
      <h2>Maybe the problem is anti-Trudeau sentiments are the heart of all the dysfunction. And maybe even Scott Moe is getting tired of it.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:00:02+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/mmandryk" target="_blank">Murray Mandryk</a></address>
      <p>If you are puzzled by the more conciliatory tone from Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe toward the new federal Liberal cabinet, you are not alone.</p>
      <p>After all, the stated line from Moe’s Saskatchewan Party government is that <a href="https://twitter.com/PremierScottMoe/status/1197284952938704896?s=20">it really doesn’t matter who’s in cabinet; it matters what they do.</a> Read: There’s nothing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau can ever do to appease Saskatchewan/the West/conservatives. This is consistent with the hyper-partisanship we saw before and during the federal election … and now, after.</p>
      <p>Consider <a href="https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/mandryk-moes-tantrum-precisely-the-wrong-starting-point-for-a-new-deal">Moe’s post-election-day tantrum</a> pretty much demanding the Liberals drop everything they successfully ran on, or his <a href="https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/mandryk-did-moe-go-to-ottawa-looking-for-a-fight-rather-than-results">petulance during his meeting with Trudeau l</a>ast week that seemed all about securing a meme about how Trudeau doesn’t care, or even the recent cabinet appointments where the Saskatchewan <a href="https://twitter.com/PremierScottMoe/status/1197231565647953920?s=20">premier didn’t even immediately congratulate new ministers before making demands</a> of them.</p>
      <p>It goes far beyond forgetting simple political courtesies. It’s outright contempt.</p>
      <p>So imagine the surprise when we all heard <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/moe-watching-for-shift-in-policy-not-personnel-as-federal-cabinet-shuffled">Moe’s kind words</a> about his “fairly strong working relationship” with new<a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/chrystia-freeland-appointed-deputy-prime-minister-heres-what-that-means?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574345157&amp;utm_medium=Postmedia_organic&amp;utm_campaign=300_trending_boosting&amp;utm_content=300_onnetwork"> Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland</a>, who takes on the role of intergovernmental affairs minister while maintaining her previous hefty responsibilities for the free trade negotiations.</p>
      <p>Moe had similar sentiments for Winnipeg MP and former international trade minister Jim Carr and his role of special representative for the Prairies that will “focus entirely on that relationship … engage with the Prairies in a strong and present way.” And while Moe reserved judgment for Saskatchewan-raised Jonathan Wilkinson (a one-time adviser to the former NDP premier Roy Romanow during the Charlottetown accord), his appointment wasn’t greeted with the usual vitriol.</p>
      <p>So what gives?</p>
      <p>It can’t be the recognition that federalists must bond together against today’s Western separatism sentiment. Moe remains weak on condemning western separatists — even as<a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/sask-party-not-sounding-alarm-about-wexit-electoral-threat"> #wexit now stands as a direct electoral threat to provincial and federal conservative parties because it’s attempting to run candidates. </a>Perhaps it’s because even the Sask. Party government doesn’t take #wexit nonsense all that seriously; but, more likely, it’s because the anti-Trudeau sentiments are that hardened.</p>
      <p>Maybe the problem is anti-Trudeau sentiments are the heart of all the dysfunction. And maybe even Scott Moe is getting tired of it.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the incessant game-playing at the Saskatchewan legislature on Thursday over whether the NDP or the Sask. Party got the required unanimity to present a <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/politics/push-for-rail-strike-action-derailed-by-political-squabbling-in-sask-legislature">meaningless emergency debate to get federally regulated CN Rail workers back on the job,</a> one senses Moe does want to get on with the<a href="https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/mandryk-feds-desperately-need-to-properly-handle-rail-strike-for-more-than-economic-reasons"> job of fixing such weighty problems.</a> Often, that does require federal cooperation.</p>
      <p>The exasperation in dealing with Trudeau — and former environment minister Catherine McKenna, who, to the Western conservatives, embodies the Liberals’ anti-oil development, anti-pipeline, pro-carbon tax direction — is real. And while Moe may claim it’s about policies and not personalities, it’s only human nature to seek out those you like and can work with.</p>
      <p>Thus, the kinder sentiments toward Carr, Wilkinson and especially Freeland. She has not been at ground zero on the carbon tax fight. She has earned grudging respect from Moe and other Western conservatives for her effective work on the USMCA trade deal so critical to Western exports, and she does seem to have a much healthier working relationship with Moe and others.</p>
      <p>For example, last week at the launch of the 2030 Growth Plan<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/c5zjsmiuj8swgvr/Tim%20Gitzel%20Introduction.mp4?dl=0">, Cameco president and CEO Tim Gitzel glowingly spoke of how his company was having “an administrative issue” </a>at port with a shipment to India and that Moe’s help was much appreciated. But how could a Saskatchewan premier help?</p>
      <p>Well, the premier’s office confirmed Thursday that Moe phoned Freeland’s office (she was foreign affairs minister at the time) and she “was crucial to obtaining the export permit.”</p>
      <p>It’s the kind of federal/provincial cooperation that’s desperately needed almost daily, but it’s something that’s been lost in all the animosity.</p>
      <p>Needed/wanted here is a simple return to normalcy that allows the province and the feds to work together on solutions.</p>
      <p>The appointment of Freeland may be a welcome and hopeful development.</p>
