      <h2>Newcastle United boss Steve Bruce admires Arsenal player Granit Xhaka, who has not played for the Gunners since an angry confrontation with the club's fans</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:09:30+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:09</time> by <a rel="author">Ciaran Kelly</a></address>
      <p>Granit Xhaka has not been included in Arsenal's match day squad for the game against Southampton as Unai Emery decides to wait to recall the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> target.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old has not played for the Gunners since an angry confrontation with the club's supporters after he was substituted in the 2-2 draw against Crystal Palace at the Emirates on October 27.</p>
      <p>Xhaka, who counts <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a> among his admirers, was stripped of the captaincy and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/newcastle-united-arsenal-granit-xhaka-17279945">ChronicleLive revealed he was set for crunch talks with Emery</a> after returning from international duty this week.</p>
      <p>Emery has since revealed the pair had a 'very good conversation' and that Xhaka will have a 'long future' at the club.</p>
      <p>However, the Arsenal head coach has decided against recalling the Switzerland international just yet and he was left out of the 18-man squad against Southampton on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who succeeded Xhaka as Arsenal captain, was keen to pay tribute to the midfielder in his programme notes and called on the club's fans to support him.</p>
      <p>"I understand that sometimes one can make mistakes. It happens to all of us. Granit is one of us. We are all here for him and I know how strong he is," Aubameyang wrote.</p>
      <p>"It was tough to see all of this happening but we need to move forward together."</p>
      <p>Bruce is on the lookout for a quality midfielder but recognises that January is a difficult window to do business in as clubs are particularly keen to keep hold of their best players because there is so little time to sign a replacement.</p>
      <p>Xhaka, who has three-and-a-half years left to run on his lucrative contract at the Emirates, is settled in London with his young family.</p>
