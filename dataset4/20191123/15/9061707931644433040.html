      <h2>Derby County v Preston North End | The Rams returned to Championship action at Pride Park Stadium and suffered an injury blow</h2>

      <p>Derby County have been dealt a double injury blow in their Sky Bet Championship clash <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-preston-live-match-3569585">against Preston North End</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Rams </a>returned to league action at Pride Park Stadium in their first game after the November international break.</p>
      <p>Phillip Cocu <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-team-news-preston-3570923">made two changes to the side</a> that lost 1-0 to Nottingham Forest, with Craig Forsyth and Mason Bennett introduced in place of the injured Matt Clarke and striker Jack Marriott.</p>
      <p>Cocu was forced into an early change as midfielder Graeme Shinnie required treatment before being replaced by George Evans in the 14th minute, after being unable to carry on.</p>
      <p>The Scottish midfielder appeared to pull up with a hamstring problem after playing a pass out wide to Bennett.</p>
      <p>Shinnie had treatment on the pitch before he limped off.</p>
      <p>Derby were then dealt another injury blow as Bennett was forced to depart just after the half-hour mark, and replaced by Martyn Waghorn who then put the Rams in front against the Lilywhites.</p>
      <p>Derby were already without defender Matt Clarke.</p>
      <p>The knee injury he suffered in the defeat by Nottingham Forest before the international break will keep him out for "several weeks", which is a blow because he had started the last six matches in a partnership at the back with skipper Curtis Davies.</p>
