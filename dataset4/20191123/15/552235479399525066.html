      <h1>Car park thieves target motors parked at RAH</h1>
      <h2>Furious staff say the motors have been targeted as they work and blamed a lack of security for the thefts.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:29:23+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:29</time> by <a rel="author">Carla Talbot, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/carla-talbot/</a></address>
      <p>Brazen crooks jacked-up cars parked at the Royal Alexandra Hospital and used angle grinders to steal their catalytic convertors.</p>
      <p>Furious staff say the motors have been targeted as they work and blamed a lack of security for the thefts.</p>
      <p>According to an internal email sent to hospital workers, a number of vehicles have had parts removed by criminals in a ‘works van’ over the last few weeks.</p>
      <p>A doctor’s car was also reportedly towed away by the suspects.</p>
      <p>One RAH worker, who asked not to be named, said her car has been written off.</p>
      <p>She said: “In our case, the damage done means the car will have to be scrapped because the cost to repair it is over £700, which is just too much.</p>
      <p>“It is ridiculous that staff doing their job in a hospital are targeted in a car park covered by cameras.”</p>
      <p>Another staff member at the hospital, who also asked to remain anonymous, added: “Staff are really angry about this.</p>
      <p>“Someone has actually been able to come in to the car park, jack up a car and physically remove a catalytic converter using heavy machinery.</p>
      <p>“This isn’t a two-minute job. It would have taken time to do this and the fact that they were able to do so unchallenged, is unbelievable.</p>
      <p>“There have been other incidents and people can’t believe that one car was just blatantly towed out of the car park.”</p>
      <p>Staff are now looking for answers from bosses.</p>
      <p>The RAH worker added: “The security guards are more concerned with stopping staff from parking there than they are actually monitoring the car park.</p>
      <p>“How can someone come into a car park, put a car up on a jack and cut out its catalytic converter with no one asking any questions?”</p>
      <p>Police are probing the incidents and appealed for witnesses to come forward.</p>
      <p>Chief Inspector Dougie Falconer, area commander for Paisley, said: “We have had a number of reports of parts being stolen from cars parked at the Royal Alexandra <br/>Hospital.</p>
      <p>“I would urge people to be vigilant and report anyone acting suspiciously around or under motor vehicles parked at the hospital.</p>
      <p>“I’m concerned there may be more victims that have not yet reported thefts of parts from their car as they may not yet have realised.</p>
      <p>“If you have any information in relation to these incidents, please get in touch with police.”</p>
      <p>A NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board spokeswoman said: “We were only made aware of this issue on Monday when one member of staff reported the incident from Sunday, November 17.</p>
      <p>“We will give all assistance required to Police Scotland, which is now investigating.</p>
      <p>“We would appeal to staff to be vigilant and report any thefts or suspicious activity to our facilities staff.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information should contact police on 101, or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.</p>
