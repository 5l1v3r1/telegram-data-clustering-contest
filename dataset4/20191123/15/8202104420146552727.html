      <h3>When Manolis and Genevieve Barlas decided to renovate their family’s longtime residence at 401 Lake Crescent, in the university-adjacent neighbourhood of Grosvenor Park, they went all out. Working with Trevor Ciona and Curtis Elmy of Atmosphere Interior Design, they stripped the 2,400 square foot bungalow down to the studs and transported the mid-century modern home into the future.</h3>
      <p>“After the 2010 renovations, the home was ahead of its time. Their objective was to create a timeless, classic look,” says real estate agent Gregg Bamford.</p>
      <p>The homeowners spared no expense on the upgrades, including replacing the home’s heating and mechanical systems and electrical, upgrading the insulation and opting for a new stucco and stone exterior. “Nine years later, it’s still totally on trend — inside and out,” says Bamford.</p>
      <p>Originally constructed in 1958, the sprawling bungalow offered an open concept layout before the design trend became ubiquitous. The open flow between the kitchen, dining room and sunken living room is ideal for entertaining large groups. Flawless solid oak hardwood flooring extends throughout the space.</p>
      <p>As co-owners of Mano’s Restaurant, it’s not surprising that Manolis and Genevieve Barlas desired a stunning kitchen. Atmosphere Design dressed the kitchen in sleek oak cabinets finished in a rich shade of espresso. A ten-foot granite-topped island is a magnet for visiting family and friends. Built-in Miele appliances complement the kitchen’s sleek, contemporary look, while the copper-toned counter-to-ceiling glass tile backsplash turns up the sparkle.</p>
      <p>A few steps away is the elegant sunken living room, featuring a two-sided fireplace. The living room has two walls of full-length windows that capture views of the home’s unique outdoor courtyard and surrounding 80-foot tall pine trees.</p>
      <p>Three bedrooms are located in the south wing of the home, including the hotel-style master bedroom with its own dressing area, including a vanity and shower. The main bathroom features a Neptune air tub, separate shower and a high-tech Toto toilet.</p>
      <p>“The courtyard is a unique feature of this home. It’s totally set up for entertaining. There’s a plumbed-in outdoor kitchen. They even went as far as putting a blower system into the sunken outdoor fire pit so it would receive a constant flow of oxygen and wouldn’t create smoke,” says Bamford. “Because the courtyard is so private, it’s really like another room of the home.”</p>
      <p>The whole home renovation created quite a sensation in the neighbourhood at the time. Bamford says the construction of the unique stone wall in the bungalow’s front yard attracted quite a few spectators.</p>
      <p>“The stone wall was inspired by the Barlas’ travels to the Mediterranean. It took them two years to find the German mason to do the project. The mason hand-carved every stone in the wall. It took the mason a long time to do it, and it was his last-ever project. The stone wall gives this home amazing street appeal,” says Bamford.</p>
      <p>The exterior renovations also included pouring an aggregate concrete patio floor in the courtyard and a driveway large enough to accommodate multiple vehicles and an RV. The home’s spacious 80 by 140-foot corner lot allowed for the construction of a second garage, notes Bamford. “Now there are ‘his-and-her’ garages: a double-attached garage for her and a double-detached heated garage with workshop space for him.”</p>
      <p>The homeowners, who are transitioning to a condo, have recently listed the home for sale with Bamford, priced at $849,900. Bamford says the home is priced well below replacement cost. “This home would cost probably $1.2 million to build new.”</p>
      <p>Bamford says that bungalows are enjoying a revival in today’s real estate market. “A lot of people are rightsizing in this economy. We have a lot of people who are interested in moving out of their two-storey homes into bungalow properties. They’re concerned about mobility and aging in place. Large bungalow homes are very scarce in the new neighbourhoods of Saskatoon, because the lot sizes are so small. People love the layout of this home and they love the neighbourhood, because of its mature landscaping and proximity to the university and downtown.”</p>
