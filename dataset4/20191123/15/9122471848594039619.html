      <h1>Ohio State, Penn State Players Get Into It During Warmups</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:58:17+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Ohio State vs. Penn State is set to kick off at Noon ET, but it looks like players on both sides are ready for the contest to start a little early. FOX just aired some interesting footage during warmups on the field.</p>
      <p>In the clip, you can see players on both sides jawing at each other about an hour and a half before kickoff. It looks like both teams are ready to go for the all-important contest.</p>
      <p>The game was big enough to draw both ESPN College GameDay and FOX’s Big Noon Kickoff. It’s a huge contest for both the Big Ten and the College Football Playoff race.</p>
      <p>Here’s video of the encounter. It doesn’t look like anyone got physical – just a lot of posturing.</p>

      <p>Ohio State can win the Big Ten East with a victory. Penn State needs to win and defeat Rutgers next week to do the same.</p>
      <p>Ohio State sits at No. 2 in the College Football Playoff rankings, while Penn State checks in at No. 8. That said, this is essentially an elimination game.</p>
      <p>We’re an hour away from kickoff.</p>
