      <p>ANNA MARIA ISLAND, Fla. -- A 26-year-old Manatee County man is battling leukemia for the second time in 10 years.</p>
      <p>Matt Bauer received a bone marrow transplant on October 29, 2009. Ten years to that date, he was re-admitted to Moffitt Cancer Center.</p>
      <p>"He lost his hair. It started falling out about a week ago. His dreads went and then he cut the rest," said his friend Michael Sabato.</p>

      <p>Bauer shares his story on a Facebook page called, "Matty B's Journey."</p>
      <p>He wrote, "It's hard for me to comprehend on why this is happening to me again; 10 years later. I was readmitted to Cancer Moffitt Center 10 years to the date of my first Bone Marrow Transplant, October 29, 2009."</p>
      <p>"He just goes about life the right way. He works hard, fishes hard. Just an all around good guy. It's just a bad situation he has to go through right now," said Sabato.</p>
      <p>His friends hosted a fishing tournament on Friday, November 22. Each angler paid $50 to participate.</p>
      <p>Restaurants and local businesses like <i>Duffy's Tavern Bar and Grill </i>donated prizes and gift certificates. <i>D Coy Ducks Bar and Grille</i>, <i>Galati Yacht Sales</i> and <i>West Coast Surf Shop on Holmes Beach</i> also helped out.</p>
      <p>"Tournament ends at 3:30 p.m. on Saturday. Everyone will come and we'll weigh all the fish and pick winners," said Sabato.</p>
      <p><i>Pappo's Taqueria</i> on Anna Maria posted on Instagram saying it opened seven years ago and Bauer was one of their biggest supporters.</p>
      <p>The restaurant encourages people to donate to Bauer's <b><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/matty-b039s-second-battle-with-leukemia?utm_source=customer&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet">GoFundMe page with the #LoveShared hashtag</a> </b>. The restaurant will match every donation with the hashtag up to $2,500.</p>
      <p>The fishing tournament raised about $1,600. His friends hope to raise more money by selling t-shirts and stickers.</p>
      <p>"He's a real outgoing guy. Heâ€™s very loyal to his friends. He would give you the shirt off his back," said Sabato.</p>
      <p>Bauer hopes to be out of the hospital by the first week of December. He will need another bone marrow transplant.</p>
      <p>He wrote on Facebook, "Yes, 113 perfect matches for my Bone Marrow Transplant; which is very insane, mainly because people have two to three matches for a Bone Marrow Transplant."</p>
      <p>Those interested in helping Bauer can <b><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/matty-b039s-second-battle-with-leukemia?utm_source=customer&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet">click here</a> </b>for more details.</p>
