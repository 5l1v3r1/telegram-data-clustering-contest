      <h1>Labour voter doesn't hold back in brutal message for Tory and Brexit Party canvassers</h1>
      <h2>The poster's message for party activists began politely pledging support for Labour and praising the Green Party and some Liberal Democrat policies. But it ended in a rather offensive instruction for Brexit Party supporters</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:26:17+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:26</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Bartlett, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nicola-bartlett/</a></address>
      <p>A voter decided to make it extremely clear how they were voting by printing out a message and sticking it to their front door to avoid having to interact with canvassers who are</p>
      <p>The message starts off with a very polite tone but ends up full of swear words by the time it comes to addressing the Tories and then the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> Party.</p>
      <p>It begins "canvassers take note" telling those from the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> Party "You have my vote".</p>
      <p>It also has a positive message for Green Party activists saying: "My heart is with you and I would love to vote for you but getting rid of the Tories is more important right now."</p>
      <p>There is a more lukewarm response for Jo Swinson's party: "Lib Dems: I have sympathies with some of your policies."</p>

      <p>When it comes to the Tories the message turned hostile but it had an important point to make about the party's record in government.</p>
      <p>It read: "Tory:Â  just f*** off with your bulls*** you deserve oblivion for the way you've treated the country, your tenure has been a disaster lives have been lost and public services stripped to the bone."</p>
      <p>But for Nigel Farage's new party the Labour voter had nothing but contempt.</p>
      <p>The message read: "Brexit Party: F*** off and when you get there f*** off from there too then f*** off some more keep f***ing off until you get back then f*** off again. You are disgusting creatures that I hope will be extinct soon."</p>
