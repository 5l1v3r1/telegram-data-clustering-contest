      <p>A couple has been rescued in Still Bay after getting caught in rip currents while swimming near the mouth of the Goukou River.</p>
      <p>The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Still Bay duty crew was notified of two swimmers who appeared to be in difficulty at around 17:35 on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"Following a brief search at the river mouth, we found a couple – a 27-year-old male and 22-year-old female, from Jongensfontein – 250 metres off-shore of the river mouth, behind the backline," NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said in a statement on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The woman was assisting the man, who was unconscious, to stay afloat in the water.</p>
      <p>"They were rescued onto our sea rescue craft and brought safely into Still Bay harbour with our NSRI medics treating the couple for hypothermia and non-fatal drowning symptoms."</p>
      <p>The woman was treated for hypothermia while the man was stabilised and regained consciousness. He was taken to hospital and was discharged the next day.</p>
