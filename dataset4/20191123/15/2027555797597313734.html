      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:26:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/afp" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p> India declared their first innings on 347 for nine on Saturday after skipper Virat Kohli's sparkling 136 on day two of the maiden day-night Test for both the teams.</p>
      <p>The hosts, leading the two-match series 1-0, managed a crucial lead of 241 in response to Bangladesh's 106 in India's pink ball debut in Kolkata.</p>
      <p>Wriddhiman Saha, on 17, and Mohammed Shami, on 10, were batting in the second session when Kohli called them back to keep India on track for a very early finish in the five-day game.</p>
      <p>Kohli played with ease and completed his 27th century before falling to a stunning catch by concussion substitute Taijul Islam.</p>
      <p>Taijul, a left-arm spinner, made it count with a wicket of Ajinkya Rahane for 51 and then took a diving catch at fine leg to send back Kohli off paceman Ebadat Hossain.</p>
      <p>India lost a few quick wickets, but Saha and Shami got a few boundaries and a six by the last man in pulverised the Bangladesh bowlers.</p>
      <p>Pacemen Al-Amin Hossain and Ebadat took three wickets each.</p>
      <p>Kohli stood out with his prolific scoring as he put on crucial partnerships including a 99-run stand with overnight partner Rahane.</p>
      <p>The star batsman smashed paceman Abu Jayed for four straight boundaries in one over before finishing with 18 fours in his 194-ball stay.</p>
      <p>Cheteshwar Pujara also contributed with a useful 55 in a 94-run stand with Kohli after India lost their openers on day one.</p>
      <p>Ishant Sharma led India's inspired pace attack and took five wickets to bundle out Bangladesh in the second session on Friday.</p>
