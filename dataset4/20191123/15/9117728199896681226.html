          <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull</a> team principal Christian Horner has said that “the loser is always the team” in situations like <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a>’s at the Brazilian Grand Prix when teammates collide, leading to both cars retiring.</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Ferrari’s <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/charles-leclerc">Charles Leclerc</a> came together at Interlagos last weekend when battling each other on track, causing both to retire from the race with damage and prompting boss Mattia Binotto to call for a meeting with the pair.<br/> <br/>Horner himself has had to deal with similar situations before when Vettel, driving for Red Bull, collided with teammate Mark Webber at the Turkish Grand Prix in 2010.</p>
      <p><i>"It depends on the scenario and each team has a different approach, and different people have different approaches, so it's difficult for me to judge Ferrari's situation," </i>said Horner as quoted by <i>Autosport.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"But the loser is always the team in that situation. Obviously it is a tricky one."</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Briton also said that the resulting decision in what is best for the team quite often isn’t the best decision for the drivers as individuals.</p>
      <p><i>“I'm glad it's not my drivers," </i>he added.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"It's always a difficult situation.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Race drivers are fiercely competitive animals, and there is often a conflict between what is right for the team and what is right for the individual."</i>
      </p>
