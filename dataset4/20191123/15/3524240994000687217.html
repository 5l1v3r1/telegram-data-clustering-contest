      <p>The Nigeria Immigration Service has intercepted a suspected trafficker with five female victims en route Niger Republic to Europe.</p>
      <p>The Comptroller-General of Nigeria Immigration Service, Muhammad Babandede commended the Katsina State command for making it difficult for traffickers and human smugglers to use the state as a transit point.</p>
      <p>The CG in a statement in Abuja on Saturday congratulated the team at Kongolam for being alert to their duty and operating a water-tight control and well-organized patrol in the area.</p>
      <p>It said, “The Comptroller-General reiterated that the days of crossing our national frontiers without  proper documentation and melting into border communities is over as the Special Border Corps and regular border control officers are on their toes 24/7   patrolling with the aim of enforcing adequate border security and control, while regulating human mobility in line with Federal Government directives.”</p>
      <p>The suspect and his victims had been handed over to the Kano zonal office of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons for further necessary action.</p>
