      <p>A heavily pregnant Muslim woman who was repeatedly punched and stomped on during a suspected racially motivated attack in a western Sydney cafe says she “fears for the world our children will grow up in”.</p>
      <p>NSW Police said Rana Elasmar, 31, who was 38 weeks pregnant, was with her friends at a Parramatta cafe on Wednesday night when a 43-year-old man approached her table.</p>

      <p>CCTV footage showed the man having a brief conversation with the group before lunging over the table and repeatedly punching the face of Ms Elasmar, who then fell to the ground.</p>
      <p>He is then seen stomping at her head several times before other patrons at the cafe intervene and pull him away from her.</p>
      <p>Police said the man was not known to the women and they were investigating if the attack was racially motivated.</p>
      <p>It is alleged the man, Stipe Lozina, made a comment about Muslims before Ms Elasmar was assaulted.</p>
      <p>“Our police investigation is still in its infancy but it would appear to be completely random and unprovoked,” Parramatta police Inspector Lucas Sywenkyj said.</p>
      <p>After she was released from Westmead Hospital, Ms Elasmar posted a lengthy message on Facebook, opening up about the “lack of humanity” behind her assault.</p>
      <p>She said members of the Muslim community were familiar with being on the receiving end of Islamophobia.</p>
      <p>“I was born and raised in Sydney, Australia. I am a Muslim,” Ms Elasmar said.</p>
      <p>“I have experienced occurrences of verbal abuse and hate from other Australians in the past, but I have never thought that physical abuse of this nature could happen to me.”</p>
      <p>Mr Lozina was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray.</p>
      <p>He appeared at Parramatta Local Court on Thursday and had his bail application refused.</p>
      <p>The Executive Officer of the Muslim Women’s Association Maha Abdo said her organisation had spoken with a member of Ms Elasmar’s family to express their support.</p>
      <p>“She needs to get over the shock first of all, at the moment she’s in a state of shock along with the whole family,” she said.</p>
      <p>Ms Abdo said it was very worrying.</p>
      <p>“We are all concerned. You are actually sitting in a cafe in a group, you would think that is the safest place to be. We are all trying to deal with it.”</p>
      <p>The assault occurred in the week a study was released showing women wearing headscarves were at the most risk of Islamophobic attacks.</p>
      <p>“We are mothers, wives, daughters … and we deserve to feel safe wherever we go,” Ms Elasmar said.</p>
      <p>“I fear for the world our children will grow up in, if this issue is not addressed.”</p>
