      <p>Urban Meyer and Cardale Jones won a national championship together at Ohio State. The former Buckeyes head coach and quarterback led the Columbus program to the first College Football Playoff title in the 2014 season.</p>
      <p>Meyer has since retired from coaching, turning the Ohio State program over to Ryan Day. Jones spent multiple seasons in the NFL and is currently set to play for Washington, D.C.’s XFL team.</p>
      <p>The two are reunited in Columbus this morning.</p>
      <p>Jones appeared on FOX’s <i>Big Noon Kickoff </i>with his former head coach.</p>
