      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Bangladesh were reeling at 152/6, trailing India by 89 runs at Stumps</li>
        <li>Mushfiqur Rahim's unbeaten 59 helped Bangladesh survive Day 2</li>
        <li>Ishant Sharma took his tally in the match to 9 wickets</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When Ishant Sharma was steaming in and making the pink ball talk in the much-talked-about twilight period on Saturday, it looked like the historic Day-night Test would end inside 2 days.</p>
      <p>However, a stiff resistance from Mushfiqur Rahim who remained unbeaten on 59 at Stumps helped Bangladesh take the Pink ball Test to Sunday. Ishant Sharma shone with the ball with a match tally of 9 wickets after Virat Kohli dominated proceedings with the bat, scoring his first hundred with the pink ball.</p>
      <p>Bowlers dominated the proceedings in the twilight period at another housefull day at Eden Gardens. India went from 289 for 4 to 331 for 9 but captain Virat Kohli gave his pacers enough time to make use of the conditions as India declared on 347 for 9 with a 241-run lead.</p>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Umesh Yadav joined the party as Bangladesh top four managed just single-digit scores. Their captain Mominul Haque was dismissed for a pair in their 1st ever Pink ball Test as Bangladesh were staring at a huge defeat.</p>
      <p>However, two of Bangladesh's most senior campaigners on the tour, Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah joined hands as the visitors showed some fight for the 1st time in this Pink ball Test.</p>
      <p>In the post-Tea session wherein the Pink ball stopped doing as much as it did under the twilight, Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur Rahim started playing some delightful strokes, halting India's charge.</p>
      <p>Mahmudullah weather a barrage of short balls from India pacers while Mushfiqur looked solid out in the middle. The duo added 69 runs for the 5th wicket before Mahmudullah suffered a hamstring injury. The Bangladesh T20I captain was not able to continue and it provided another window of opportunity.</p>
      <p>However, there was another steady resistance as Mushfiqur Rahim combined with concussion substitute Mehidy Hasan and stitched a 51-run stand.</p>
      <p>Ishant Sharma though came back to break the solid stand towards the end of the 2nd day's play at Eden Gardens. With 4 wickets in the 2nd innings, Ishant took his match tally to 9 wickets. Umesh Yadav got the wicket of Taijul Islam towards the close of the day's play to put India on the cusp of a huge win.</p>

        <b>Virat Kohli shines with historic hundred</b>
      </p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, Eden Gardens crowd was treated to a Virat Kohli masterclass as the India captain became the 1st from the country to hit a hundred in a Pink ball Test.</p>
      <p>Virat Kohli spoke at length about the challenges of facing the pink ball in the lead up to the historic Test but the skipper was at ease throughout his 194-ball stay at the middle.</p>
      <p>Kohli hit 18 boundaries as he dominated the Bangladesh attack. He was looking set for a double hundred but was caught in the deep on 136, thanks to a stunning effort from Taijul Islam. Kohli was in disbelief even as he walked back to the dressing room with a standing ovation from the packed crowd at the Eden.</p>
