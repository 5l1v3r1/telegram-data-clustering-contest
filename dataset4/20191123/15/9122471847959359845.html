      <h1>The Latest On KJ Hamler Before Kickoff vs. Ohio State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:43:44+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>We’re less than two hours away from kickoff for this year’s Ohio State-Penn State matchup. Although his status isn’t official yet, it appears that KJ Hamler will be ready to play.</p>
      <p>Penn State was dealt unfortunate injury news on Friday involving its offense. Starting center Michal Menet will not be available <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/penn-state-nittany-lions/penn-state-ohio-state-michal-menet-injury-out-chase-young">due to an undisclosed injury</a>.</p>
      <p>Hamler entered this week as questionable because of an injury to his head/neck area. James Franklin admit earlier in the week that he was hopeful that his star wideout would be active, but he wasn’t sure yet.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for the Nittany Lions, Hamler is warming up on the field at Ohio Stadium.</p>

      <p>This is an excellent sign for his availability today.</p>
      <p>If Hamler truly couldn’t play this afternoon against the Buckeyes, the chances of him warming up for an extended period of time would be slim.</p>

      <p>Sean Clifford needs Hamler for this game if the team wants to potentially upset Ohio State on the road. The sophomore wideout has 46 receptions for 791 yards and eight touchdowns this season.</p>
      <p>Since kickoff is just around the corner, the Nittany Lions will know soon whether or not Hamler will play.</p>
      <p>FOX will broadcast all the action today between Ohio State and Penn State.</p>
