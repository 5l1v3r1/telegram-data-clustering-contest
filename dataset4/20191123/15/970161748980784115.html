      <p>Marnie Simpson and Casey Johnson have finally revealed their baby son’s name three weeks after his birth – and also the names they decided against.</p>
      <p>The couple have decided to call their little one Rox, and they admitted it was the only name they both agreed on.</p>
      <p>Marnie, 27, told OK!: ‘I came up with it. It popped up quite near the end. I like that it’s unusual for a boy.’</p>
      <p>She also revealed what they almost named the baby: ‘The other names I liked were Columbus, Diego, and Emmett.</p>
      <p>‘Ultimately, Casey would have let me choose the name, but I wanted him to enjoy it, too.’</p>
      <p>Casey, 24, said he had to put his foot down when Marnie came up with a middle name he thought their child would be mocked for at school.</p>

      <p>He explained: ‘Marnie wanted his middle name to be Star but I had to put my foot down! I thought it was silly. He would have had the p**s taken out of him at school.’</p>

      <p>She was in labour for 28 hours and had to have a vacuum-assisted delivery, ending up losing two pints of blood after having a postpartum haemorrhage.</p>
      <p>Marnie told her followers about the scary experience: ‘Obviously, it was a very traumatic experience for me and it wasn’t the easiest labour, but I’m just so thankful that everyone’s so supportive and [has] been there for us.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘I had a bad birth experience and a traumatic labour. It did not go to plan which is really upsetting. As long as baby is healthy that’s all that matters.</p>
      <p>‘I can’t believe that I’m a mam now. I can’t wait to show you guys the baby. I just can’t wait to show you all him. He’s worth every bit of pain that I went through.’</p>
