      <p>A lady who posted the video on social media wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>People please be very careful, this man was caught in my area, (Bada in Ayobo Ipaja) he goes about sending fake alert to POS shops and receiving cash from them.. He has done this act severally in a friends POS shop and has succeeded but was caught on this faithful day. Plsss take note of his face in order not to fall victim to his scam.<br/><br/>He said he does the act because he is asthmatic, he claim he came all the way from Benin which obvious is a lie because he seems Yoruba. He also claim its his first time performing this act which is also a lie because he has done it and succeeded severally more than three POS out let. He is even a car owner bt claims he picked his car key on the ground.<br/><br/>He has been handed over to the police (Ayobo division) for proper questioning.</blockquote>
