      <h2>Test skipper doing his bit to ensure Tasmania teammate is well-prepared in his bid for national selector job</h2>

      <p>Australian Test captain Tim Paine has done his best to prepare long-time state teammate George Bailey for the vacant national selector job, revealing the pair held a mock interview in the dressing room during a Marsh Sheffield Shield game.</p>
      <p>Bailey, still playing for Tasmania this season, appears to be in a battle with fellow domestic stalwart Michael Klinger to join Trevor Hohns and Justin Langer on a three-man panel.</p>
      <p>The pair were both in Brisbane for interviews on Sunday, a broad-smiling Bailey cutting a relaxed figure - one he perhaps had Paine to thank for - ahead of his sit-down with Cricket Australia's top brass.</p>
      <p>"In last week's Shield game he was batting at five, I was batting at seven, so we were both sitting in the change rooms and set up a mock interview," Paine said on ABC radio.</p>
      <p>"He's ready to go so hopefully he gets the nod, I think he'd be ideal."</p>
      <p>Bailey is contracted to Tasmania and the Hobart Hurricanes until the end of this season, but his playing commitments are reportedly not seen as a barrier.</p>
      <p>Cricket Australia boss Kevin Roberts hopes to confirm the announcement within a week.</p>
      <p>Roberts said CA had received plenty of humours applications after posting the job vacancy online, but that they had also been impressed with the findings of their search.</p>
      <p>"Ben Oliver (high performance boss) to his credit has worked through a really good series of discussions with potential candidates and it has really opened our eyes," Roberts said on SEN radio.</p>
