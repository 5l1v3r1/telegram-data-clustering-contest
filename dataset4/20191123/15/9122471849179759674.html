      <h1>Kirk Herbstreit Hints At College GameDay’s Potential Location During Rivalry Week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:44:29+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>ESPN College GameDay has never been to Minnesota, but it looks like it’s possible that could be changing soon. Kirk Herbstreit hinted that the Golden Gophers have a decent shot at luring the show next week.</p>
      <p>A few weeks back, ESPN chose Tuscaloosa for Alabama vs. LSU over Minneapolis for Minnesota vs. Penn State. Golden Gophers fans were understandably upset, given the situation.</p>
      <p>Herbstreit told viewers on ESPN on Saturday to keep an eye on Minnesota vs. Northwestern today, because it could have “GameDay implications.” In short, that means that if the Golden Gophers win, ESPN is going to very much consider heading up to Minneapolis.</p>
      <p>If both Minnesota and Wisconsin win on Saturday, the rivalry game next Saturday would be for the Big Ten West title and a shot at either Ohio State or Penn State in the league’s title game.</p>

      <p>Minnesota is in the midst of one of its best seasons in recent memory, but the Golden Gophers did lose to Iowa last week. Still, they’re 9-1 with a shot at winning the Big Ten and playing in the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>Minnesota and Wisconsin are dead tied in their rivalry at 60-60-8. The Golden Gophers won last year’s meeting – their first win over the Badgers since 2003.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, GameDay decides to make the trip. It’d be a nice change of pace.</p>
