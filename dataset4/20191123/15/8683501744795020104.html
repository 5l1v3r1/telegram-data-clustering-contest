      <p>That's it. Daniel Craig is now a former James Bond actor. <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2428130/no-time-to-die"><i>No Time to Die</i></a>, aka Bond 25, has wrapped filming, so unless he goes back for more reshoots, he has shaken not stirred Bond girls and bad guys for the last time.</p>
      <p>It took some teeth-pulling to get Daniel Craig to come back for <i>No Time to Die</i>, and when <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1692450/daniel-craig-confirms-return-for-james-bond-25">he confirmed his return news</a> a couple of years ago on <i>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</i>, it was with the understanding that it would be his final Bond film. But considering Craig had said he'd <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1692459/in-retrospect-how-daniel-craig-feels-about-his-james-bond-slash-my-wrist-comments">rather slash his own wrists</a> than come back for another Bond movie after <i>Spectre</i>, fans figured maybe the guy just needed more time to think about it and he'd return.</p>
      <p>Nope.</p>
      <p>Daniel Craig went back to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq8nR7EiIXU&amp;feature=emb_title"><i>The Late Show</i></a> to talk to his buddy Stephen Colbert and confirmed he is now an ex-James Bond actor:</p>
      <blockquote><b>Stephen Colbert</b>: Are you done with Bond?<br/><b>Daniel Craig</b>: Yes.<br/><b>Stephen Colbert</b>: You’re done with Bond?!<br/><b>Daniel Craig</b>: It’s done.</blockquote>
      <p>That's it. But before we all go crazy again with the Who Will Be The Next James Bond suggestions, let's let Daniel Craig finishes his run in style. He recently gave a touching -- <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481224/a-quite-drunk-daniel-craig-wrapped-bond-25-filming-with-a-moving-speech">albeit drunken</a> -- wrap speech saying he had a wonderful experience making <i>No Time to Die</i>.</p>
      <p>During his talk on <i>The Late Show</i>, Daniel Craig discussed <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483752/no-time-to-dies-daniel-craig-drops-f-bomb-defending-phoebe-waller-bridge">reaching out to Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> to get her to co-write the 2020 Bond movie script. Stephen Colbert also broke out recent footage from Rami Malek, who <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483288/rami-maleks-no-time-to-die-bond-villain-safin-is-a-nasty-piece-of-work">plays the new Bond villain</a> in the movie.</p>
      <p>In the clip, Rami Malek said Daniel Craig was his favorite Bond, and he talked about a particularly difficult scene they were trying to crack in <i>No Time to Die</i>. When they finally figured out how to navigate it, Rami said Daniel pulled him in for a kiss. It was surprising, but welcome. But Rami quipped afterward, "Does this make me a Bond girl?" Daniel Craig answered that on <i>The Late Show</i>, joking, "I kiss all my leading men. I think it just breaks the ice."</p>

      <p>So it sounds like they had a pretty fun time making <i>No Time to Die</i>, despite <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2475951/after-injury-daniel-craig-is-back-the-set-of-bond-25">Daniel Craig's injury</a> and the other problems behind-the-scenes. Back when Craig confirmed his Bond return, we still thought the movie would be coming out on November 8, 2019. Obviously that didn't happen, because director Danny Boyle dropped out and a new director had to be hired in Cary Joji Fukunaga.</p>
      <p>Now we've seen <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481652/bond-25-no-time-to-die-poster-is-here-to-underwhelm-you">the first poster</a> for <i>No Time to Die</i> and a <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483227/james-bond-fans-arent-sold-on-daniel-craigs-new-look-in-no-time-to-die">surprising new look at</a> Daniel Craig's James Bond, but we're on standby for the first trailer.</p>
      <p>The Bond 25 release date was initially moved to February 14, 2020. It was moved once again to April 3 in the U.K. and April 8 in the U.S -- and those are the current release dates for <i>No Time to Die</i>.
