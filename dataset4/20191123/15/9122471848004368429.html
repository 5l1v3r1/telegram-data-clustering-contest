      <h1>Lee Corso: Today Is Clay Helton’s Last Game At USC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:42:50+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday morning, ESPN’s College GameDay kicked off from Columbus ahead of the biggest game of the weekend. No. 2 Ohio State hosts No. 8 Penn State in a battle of College Football Playoff contenders.</p>
      <p>Before Saturday’s slate of games kicks off, the GameDay crew broke down the coming action.</p>
      <p>While most the attention is on the Ohio State-Penn State game, the crew made sure to look at other games as well. A big rivalry game takes place in Southern California between USC and UCLA.</p>
      <p>During their breakdown of the game, ESPN’s Lee Corso suggested this will be Clay Helton’s last game as the Trojans head coach.</p>
      <p>“No matter what, this is Clay Helton’s last game,” Corso said.</p>

      <p>Now, he could just be speaking literally. This is the final regular season game for the Trojans this year. They have a shot at the Pac-12 title game, if Utah loses, and a bowl game looms for the team as well.</p>
      <p>Helton’s future with the program was in doubt before Corso’s comments. USC hired a new athletic director, which could spell the end for Helton as the Trojans head coach.</p>
      <p>But first, he’ll try to lead USC to a win over UCLA and move to 8-4 on the season.</p>
