      <p>Zhou, who is 75, was last seen in the 7000 block of Firbridge Way, near Minoru Boulevard and just north of Westminster Highway, around 1 p.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 20.</p>
      <p>The group came together Friday after Caryn Zhang put out a call for volunteers to help look for Zhou on the Chinese social media platform WeChat.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Zhang and other members of the search group were in Steveston to hand out flyers and ask residents for any information about Zhou.</p>
      <p>Zhang said she felt hopeful after hearing that one resident saw a woman who looks like Zhou eating free food at the new Save-On-Foods in Steveston around 4 p.m. on Friday.</p>
      <p>Zhang has shared this information with Richmond RCMP.</p>
      <p>The volunteers, including Zhang, plan to gather at Richmond Public Library Brighouse branch Saturday afternoon, where they will break into groups to continue searching for Zhou.</p>
      <p>According to Richmond RCMP, Zhou is a 5-foot-2 (157 centimetres) Asian woman, with brown eyes and white hair. She only speaks Mandarin.</p>
      <p>Zhou may appear confused or disorientated.</p>
      <p>She was last seen wearing a pink, long-sleeve shirt, long black hooded coat, black pants and pink shoes.</p>
      <p>Anyone who wishes to join the search effort can contact Zhang at 778-892-1228.</p>
      <p>If you have any information about Zhou or locate her, contact Richmond RCMP.</p>
