      <p>Mario Balotelli has been dropped for Sunday’s Serie A trip to AS Roma after a training ground bust-up with new Brescia coach Fabio Grosso.</p>
      <p>Ex-World Cup winner Grosso, who took over the struggling northern side this month, was reported to be angered by the Italian forward’s lazy attitude in training on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Balotelli stormed out of the session and has now been dropped and could face disciplinary action.</p>
      <p>“I demand great rhythm and intensity, when it doesn’t happen I prefer to change. He didn’t do it and he was cast aside,” Grosso told a pre-match press conference on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The 2006 World Cup winner’s word echoes those of Balotelli’s former coaches which included Antonio Conte, Roberto Mancini, and Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want to minimise or blow it out of proportion. For me, it will be crucial to use everyone at my disposal, but I can only do so much,” continued Grosso.</p>
      <p>“I told Mario that I can only help him to a certain point. Then he has to help himself.”</p>
      <p>Balotelli, who was born in Sicily but adopted and raised just outside Brescia, agreed on a three-year deal with the Serie B champions after being released by Marseille last June.</p>
      <p>But it has been a difficult start to the campaign for the 29-year-old with two goals scored in seven matches.</p>
      <p>The former Inter Milan, Manchester City, and Liverpool striker were also targeted by racist chanting in Verona where he threatened to walk off the pitch.</p>
      <p>Balotelli, who has 36 caps for Italy, has not featured on the international stage in over a year as coach Mancini said he was not playing at a high enough standard.</p>
      <p>Brescia is the bottom of the Serie A table and travels to Roma looking for their first win in two months.</p>
