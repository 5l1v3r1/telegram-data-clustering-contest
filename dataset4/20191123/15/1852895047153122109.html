      <h4>Christmas came early for Stassie Karanikolaou after her BFF Kylie Jenner got her a stunning diamond ring that you must see to believe!</h4>
      <p>Girls night out! <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/kylie-jenner/"><b>Kylie Jenner</b></a>, 22 and <b>Stassie Karanikolaou</b>, 22, documented their fun evening with one another on Instagram on Nov. 22. The sexy galpals watched the Lakers game in a private booth with other friends that included social media superstar <b>Kelsey Calemine</b>, 20, and Kylie’s personal assistant <b>Victoria Villarroel</b>, 27. The beauty mogul dressed casually in an oversized black hoodie while Stassie showed some skin in a midriff-baring top. It was an extra special night for Stassie in particular as she showed off the gorgeous diamond ring that Kylie got her in one of her Instagram Stories! “@kyliejenner you shouldn’t have!” she captioned the story next to several happy-related emojis. Stassie put the bedazzled sparkler on display while Kylie struck a sexy pose in the background.</p>
      <p>Kylie later shared an Instagram Story of her snuggling up with Stassie in a car while “Beauty in the Benz” by <b>Tory Lanez</b>, 27, and <b>Snoop Dogg</b>, 48, played in the background. They acted seductively for the camera during the short footage before their night ended.</p>
      <p>The Kylie Cosmetics founder was in mommy mode earlier in the day when she spent it with her adorable daughter <b>Stormi</b>, 1. Kylie shared an Instagram photo of her little one <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/22/stormi-webster-beaded-braids-kylie-jenner-daughter-tie-dye-outfit-photo/">rocking some beaded braids</a> and a tie dye shirt while calling her the “coolest girl I know.” Stormi also did a couple of super cute dance moves in their parking lot with a big smile on her face later on in the day. “Are you happy?” Kylie asked her to which she ecstatically replied “Yes!”</p>

      <p>Kylie and Stassie have enjoyed quite the exciting 2019 with each other. They traveled to the Turks &amp; Caicos in July 2019 where fans <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/07/17/kylie-jenner-stassie-karanikolaou-photoshop-accusations-dress-photo-turks-and-caicos/">accused them of photoshopping their pics</a> during their time abroad!</p>
      <p>Stassie also made waves when she and Kylie’s older half-brother <b>Rob Kardashian</b>, 32, were spotted in a <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/01/rob-kardashian-stassie-pda-halloween-party-photo/">state of PDA</a> at a Halloween party on Oct. 31! But don’t worry folks, they are just friends. “There is absolutely nothing going on between Rob and Stassie,” a source for <b>HollywoodLife</b> revealed EXCLUSIVELY on Nov. 2. </p>
