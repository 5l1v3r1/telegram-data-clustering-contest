      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:05:37+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:05</time> by <a rel="author">Emilia Bona</a></address>
      <p>A young entrepreneur is living the high-life racing <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/transport">supercars</a> through the Arabian desert and partying in Hollywood after setting up an <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/social-media">Instagram</a> business.</p>
      <p>Adam Jordan was just 17 when he became an 'influencer' thanks to a popular fashion account he created followed by thousands of people.</p>
      <p>Now 24, he's busy flying business class, hanging out with celebrities and raking in the cash thanks to Social Kick, his business which shows companies how to make the most of social media.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/luxury-lifestyle-scouser-making-300k-17288271?_ga=2.2720818.320361622.1574320313-917393227.1574320307">According to The Echo</a>, the former Liverpool uni marketing student is turning over a £300,000 profit.</p>
      <p>His Instagram gives an insight into his flashy lifestyle filled with snaps of him driving in a Rolls Royce and hanging out in private villas in Bali.</p>
      <p>Speaking about his enviable life, Adam said: "I believe money buys freedom, and freedom is the most valuable thing for me.</p>
      <p>"Being able to wake up when I want without someone telling me I am going to be late, being able to get up and travel the world whenever is something I value more than materialistic objects.</p>

      <p>"From driving supercars through the Arabian desert to partying in the Hollywood Hills, I've had the most incredible experiences all before I'm 25.</p>
      <p>"I'm just a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/children">young lad</a> from Liverpool who didn't expect life to take me on this journey."</p>
      <p>He added: "If you want to talk about materialistic things it's allowed me to drive around in a nice Mercedes and buy my dream Rolex."</p>
      <p>While most university graduates are looking for their first job, Adam was launching his own business in Social Kick.</p>
      <p>Having run a successful Instagram account since his teens, he built enough of a reputation to start managing other people's accounts - and making money in the process.</p>
      <p>Explaining what his job actually involves, Adam said: " I help brands and companies get exposure through social media to help them achieve their goals. Whether that's having 100,000 followers or having 100,000 installs on an app, I adapt to their needs."</p>

      <p>But it's a job that lots of people still don't understand - and many people think it sounds like an easy way to make a living.</p>
      <p>Adam added: "A misconception is usually 'so you post on Instagram for a living'. They don't see the back end of what I do, only the successes that I share on my Instagram, which I completely understand.</p>
      <p>"I don't expect everyone to know my day-to-day. While I'm talking to you now I am only running off two hours of sleep because of how much I've been working.</p>
      <p>"I always say if you want to become an entrepreneur be willing to give up the 9-5 for a 24/7 with no guarantees."</p>
      <p>But all Adam's hard work is undoubtedly paying off, with the entrepreneur estimating that his business could be set to bring in close to £300,000 this year.</p>
      <p>Despite this, he says he's 'just getting started' - with others in the industry turning over millions of pounds.</p>
      <p>Adam said: "You have to keep striving for more as I know I am still so early on in my career. There are people in my industry turning over millions so I know I still have a long way to go."</p>
      <p>Where he lives now is 'a tricky question', as Adam said: "I have spent the majority of this year between LA, Dubai and Asia. I am looking to set up base in either London or LA by January."</p>

      <p>Adam was a trailblazer on Instagram when the app was still brand new - and he's spent the last seven years mastering the ins and outs of social media.</p>
      <p>He said: "I started running a fashion blog on Instagram when it first came out, once I grew a following I started to sell advertisements on the page to brands and companies.</p>
      <p>"Then I approached other pages asking to manage them as I could connect them with brands and ultimately give them an income. This is back when it was unheard of that brands would pay people to be put on social media accounts instead of traditional marketing.</p>
      <p>"Once I'd done that, I approached the brands and pitched them what I could offer with my experience in the space and connections built from being an 'influencer'. Everything snowballed from there.</p>
      <p>"I have been doing it now for over seven years, my limited company Social Kick has officially been up and running for three years."</p>
