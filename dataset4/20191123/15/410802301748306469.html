      <p>Coach Pitso Mosimane’s men managed to score two goals in the first half to seal the victory against the home side at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium.</p>
      <p>Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana opened the scoring for the defending Absa Premiership champions before Gaston Sirino extended the Brazilians’ lead.</p>
      <p>Sirino went from hero to villain when he was given a straight red car for a late tackle in the 83<sup>rd</sup> minute.</p>
      <p>Nduduzo Sibiya pulled one back for the KZN side to give coach Steve Komphela’s men hope of making a comeback.</p>
      <p>Arrows missed an injury-time chance to take the game into extra time with a ten men Sundowns team but Mosimane’s men held on for the victory.</p>
