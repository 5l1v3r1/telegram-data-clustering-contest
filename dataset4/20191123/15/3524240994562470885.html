      <p>Former five-weight boxing world champion Floyd Mayweather says he is “coming out of retirement in 2020.”</p>
      <p>Mayweather, 42, made the announcement on social media after an earlier message that he was in talks with UFC president Dana White.</p>
      <p>“Dana White and I are working together again to bring the world another spectacular event in 2020,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mayweather’s last outing saw him win an exhibition boxing match against Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa.</p>
      <p>That fight took place in December 2018 and the American needed just 140 seconds to beat his opponent in a bout worth a reported $9m (£7m).</p>
      <p>Mayweather also came out of retirement in 2017 to beat UFC fighter Conor McGregor in the Irishman’s first ever boxing match.</p>
