      <p>A new campaign targeting unregistered voters passionate about the environmental crisis has been launched by students too young to cast their own ballots.</p>
      <p>The politically neutral movement, called #ItsOurTime, is calling on the near one third of 18 to 24 year olds who have yet to register to use their voice to take on the climate and nature emergency.</p>
      <p>Under-18s from the Birmingham Student Climate Network (BSCN) plan to take to the streets this weekend and demand action on rising temperatures and will use more than 300 flower pots to create a ‘guerrilla’ garden spelling out ‘Act Now’ in the city’s centre.</p>
      <p>Each will be labelled with pleas saying the future is in the adults’ hands and they should register to vote.</p>

      <p>Projections of rising tides are also appearing in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Belfast, Cardiff, Newport and Southampton.</p>

      <p>Celebrities including bands The Foals and The Editors, Radio 1 DJ Clara Afomo, and actor Alex Lawther are among those to have joined the campaign.</p>
      <p>YouTuber Jack Harries said: ‘We’ve been told we only have 11 years to radically transform our society to tackle climate change and whoever gets into power will be there for five years.</p>
      <p>‘So this is the climate election. If you’re 18 or over and not yet registered to vote, please consider doing so because all of our futures rely on it.’</p>
      <p>BSCN’s Aaron Smith, 17,  said: ‘I want to live in a world where I can breathe clean air and enjoy wildlife in my back garden.</p>
      <p>‘It’s my future that’s on the line. That’s why I’m calling on everyone to register to vote now so that they can decide what my future holds.’</p>

      <p>Erin Curtis, 16, from Scottish Youth Climate Strike, said: ‘The climate crisis is the single biggest issue facing our society, and time is running out to do something about it.</p>
      <p>‘The politicians we elect today have the power to take action in order to protect tomorrow.</p>
      <p>‘At my age I don’t get a say in UK elections, but I strongly urge anyone over 18 to register to vote. You have the power to change the status quo, and I really hope you use it.’</p>
