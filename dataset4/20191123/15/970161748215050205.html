      <p>There’s nothing quite like spotting something in the back of your Instagram photo that you didn’t know was there, and one Meek Mill fan got a bit more than she bargained for this week.</p>
      <p>The fan, who goes by the Twitter username of Terrzilla, shared a photo of her friend hiking at Runyon Canyon in Los Angeles, and at first glace, it’s a totally cute, influencer-worthy shot.</p>
      <p>Until you zoom in, that is…</p>
      <p>She posted: ‘my friend went hiking at runyon canyon &amp; @meekmill f**king photobombed her &amp; she didn’t know til after’.</p>
      <p>In the background of the photo, they found Meek Mill on a hike of his own, throwing up both of his middle fingers in the most epic photobomb.</p>
      <p>He replied to the tweet, saying: ‘The funny part is I really knew y’all didn’t see me do this … I said she gone see it later’.</p>

      <p>Runyon Canyon is the hiking spot of choice for pretty much every celeb in the greater Los Angeles area, so it’s not a surprise a famous face might pop up in the background every now and again.</p>

      <p>Both the rapper and the girls who took and shared the photo claimed they had no idea he was there, and were in for a surprise when they zooned in.</p>
      <p>The girl in the photos also shared the zoomed in snaps on her Instagram page, telling her followers: ‘Imagine being photobombed by Meek. “there’s n****z in yo picture!!” … smh so use to disregarding dudes that I ain’t even look back once [sic]’.</p>
      <p>There’s a lesson to be learned from this – always make sure you keep an eye out for rogue celebrities in the back of your shot – especially if they’re Meek Mill flipping you off.</p>
