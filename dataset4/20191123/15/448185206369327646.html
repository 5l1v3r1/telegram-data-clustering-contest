      <p><b>Guwahati:</b> Marwari Hospitals, a unit of Shree Marwari Databya Aushadhalaya is one of the oldest healthcare organizations in the entire north-eastern region that has completed 104 years of selfless service towards the society especially towards the economically weaker section of the society.</p>
      <p>Starting with the Gynaecology department, today Marwari Hospitals is well equipped with ICU, NICU, Blood Bank, NABL Accredited Laboratory and multi-specialty department.</p>
      <p>Being a charitable based Hospital, Marwari Hospitals always focuses on the upliftment and social welfare of the needy society by organizing free health check-up camps in different remote areas where health facilities are hardly available. Continuing the drive of serving, today on 23rd November 2019 Marwari hospitals organized a free health check-up camp at Bamundi High School, Sualkuchi.</p>
      <p>Dr Bipul Kanta Baruah, Medicine Consultant and Dr. Sankar Bora, Senior Gynaecologist Consultant from Marwari Hospitals consulted more than 275 beneficiaries. Most of the patients were suffering fever, cough, diarrhoea, skin irritation, cold, body pain, vitamin deficiency, body and joint pain, etc.</p>
      <p>Free medicines, free diabetic screening, free blood pressure check-up, free weight check-up were the main highlights of the Free Camp today.</p>
      <p>Health camps always spread a positive impact in society regarding their general health condition and hygiene. Our small effort to reach society may help the greater side of society to become more conscious and aware of the diseases and take the precaution for their health. So, from time to time Marwari Hospitals organizes many Free OPD Camps in various places in and outside of the Hospital.</p>
