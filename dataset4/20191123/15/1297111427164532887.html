      <p>The Regina Lyrics Singers are getting “Looney” with their upcoming concert. With that in mind, a few of the singers reflected on their favourite funny tunes, which you can hear on Nov. 29 and 30 during Looney Lyrics: Comical and Novelty Songs From Broadway and Pop.</p>
      <h3>‘Laughing Matters’ from When Pigs Fly (1996)</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Jane Ursan, artistic director, conductor, and founder of the Lyric Singers in 2012</b>
      </p>
      <p>“My favourite song is ‘Laughing Matters,’ which is about why I chose humour as the concert’s theme.” (The song begins, “Live at five and CNN keep us all abreast / Of breaking stories that can tend to make us anxious and depressed.”)</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stephanie Streifel</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Over 20 years later, the message of ‘human spirits need to be leavened by a little levity’ seems more important than ever.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Laurie Fisher</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Its lyrics remind us that we mustn’t lose our humour despite all the chaos, malady and discontent around us — a message that’s certainly applicable in current times.”</p>

      <h3>‘The Fox (What Does the Fox Say?)’ by Norwegian comedy duo Ylvis (2013)</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Rick Kotowich</b>
      </p>
      <p>“My favourite lyrics are the startling ‘Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!’ and other mad sounds in ‘The Fox’ song, even though they are so absolutely full-on and challenging to do.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Linda Selinger</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Lyrics are funny yet nostalgic in parts.”</p>

      <h3>‘Poisoning Pigeons in the Park’ by Tom Lehrer (1959)</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Ben Redant</b>
      </p>
      <p>“It starts out very innocent and innocuous, until it takes this very dark turn, hinted at in the song’s title. Tom Lehrer is a songwriter and satirist par excellence, and having a chance to sing one of his songs for Lyric is a lot of fun.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sabrina Cataldo</b>
      </p>
      <p>“‘All the world seems in tune on a spring afternoon, when we’re poisoning pigeons in the park.’ … It starts out as a lovely, romantic song about spring, and then it throws you this twist that is completely unexpected and absurd. I know I will not be able to keep it together while this duet is being performed. Fortunately, we’re encouraged to laugh and respond to the songs on stage.”</p>

      <h3>‘Chili Con Carne’ by The Real Group (1989)</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Angela Willford</b>
      </p>
      <p>“(It’s) basically a recipe made into a song. It is fun to sing and I love the Latin feel of it.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sarah Gaudet</b>
      </p>
      <p>“At first, I hated it! It was very overwhelming. It’s fast and repeats the words ‘chili con carne’ a lot, but in slightly different rhythms. At first glance, it felt impossible. But as I practised, the patterns became more obvious and the rhythms do make sense. Now it’s fun and I can’t help but shake my hips with the beat!</p>
      <p>“I really do think the collection of songs for this show is fun. A lot of thought went into each piece, and — without spoiling the ending — there’s a message to the audience that I think is very timely.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jan Besse</b>
      </p>
      <p>“I love the syncopated, Latin-like rhythms and lyrics, some of which are pretty looney.”</p>

      <h3>“Alto’s Lament” by Marcy Heisler and Zina Goldrich (1995)</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Jade Gritzfeld</b>
      </p>
      <p>“I remember in one choir, through the whole J.S. Bach piece, the altos sang only G for almost the entire piece, straying to an F and E when the music got really exciting. If we got an equal chance at melody or more exciting harmonies, this piece wouldn’t be so funny.”</p>

      <h3>“Nobody Makes A Pass At Me,” recorded in 1962 by Barbra Streisand</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Adriana (Christianson) Putz</b>
      </p>
      <p>“My favourite lyric from a song this year is ‘Oh dear, what can the matter be?’ That particular line is my three-year-old son’s favourite. It’s from my first solo song called ‘Nobody Makes A Pass At Me.’ The character I play is quite over-the-top ridiculous and a very awkward flirt, which has been fun to play because it’s exercising my rusty comic acting skills.”</p>
