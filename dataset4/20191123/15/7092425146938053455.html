        <b>Kim Kardashian has spoken out on Caitlyn Jenner appearing on I'm a Celebrity.... Get Me Out of Here!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Up until now, the Kardashian/Jenner clan had remained silent on Caitlyn appearing on the reality show.</p>
      <p>Kim shared a video of Caitlyn giving a motivational speech to fellow campmates, adding: "I literally recorded this and set this as my alarm a few weeks ago!"</p>
      <p>Caitlyn, 70, told her co-stars: "Let's go team. Not just another day, another day to excel, another day to be great. Rise and shine!"</p>
      <p>Kim said she uses Caitlyn's message as her alarm.....a little odd, but fair enough.</p>

      <p>Fans had previously claimed silence from the family suggested they were unhappy with Caitlyn being on the show.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn has praised Kim and her husband Kanye West in the jungle.</p>
      <p>She said: "Kimberly never went to college. The minute she left high school she started businesses. She had her first business out of the closet. Kimberly would go into the ladies’ closets. Some of these are like 2,000 square feet – they’re huge. Beverly Hills ladies. They figure out what they want to get rid of and Kimberly has an eBay site… Kimberly sells them for them and gets 30% commission."</p>
      <p>Speaking about Kim's husband, she said: "I like Kanye. Kanye was very, very good to me."</p>
