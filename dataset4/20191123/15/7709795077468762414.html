      <p>Nicky Henderson's horse had won all 19 of his races over obstacles heading into the clash and he was sent of the 1/3 favourite to make it 20 in this Grade 2.</p>
      <p>However, he was taking a step into the unknown going up in trip to 2m5f and he was taking on a horse that had won his last two over the course and distance in tremendous style.</p>
      <p>Cyrname likes to front run and Altior likes to stalk, and that's how it played out, with the outsider of three Solomon Grey beaten by the third fence.</p>
      <p>Paul Nicholls' horse made an error early on under Harry Cobden, but he soon got into a rhythm and it became clear at the top of the straight that Altior had a real task on to reel him in.</p>
      <p>He couldn't get to his quarters at any stage, Cyrname pulling out more to win by two-and-a-quarter lengths, the great champion finally beaten when jumping a fence.</p>

      <h3>Sky Bet reaction</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Altior now 5/2 from 7/2 Queen Mother</li>
        <li>Cyrname 9/4 from 5/1 King George</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Spokesman Michael Shinners said: "Cyrname produced a fantastic performance and has propelled himself to the front of the King George market where he is now the 9/4 favourite. On the back of his performance today we have slightly eased Altior for the King George from 5/2 out to 7/2."</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Nicholls told <i>Sky Sports Racing</i>: "I'm very proud of him and the whole team, who have played a big part in getting him right and getting him mentally right. He was very nearly unmanageable at home and on the course, then all of a sudden the penny dropped.</p>
      <p>"He started to believe in us and mature. Now we've got a horse who is the finished article.</p>
      <p>"He's a huge horse and big horses like that do need time. He was trying to do everything on one breath at one time, but there's a great saying 'Rome wasn't built in a day', and he's a great example of that.</p>
      <p>"Harry said that's the most relaxed he's been. When they came by the stands first time, I thought they were going some gallop and he had the champion chaser on his tail.</p>
      <p>"It was always going to be about stamina and three miles won't be a problem to him."</p>
      <h3>Altior reaction</h3>
      <p>Whether Altior turns up on Boxing Day for the rematch remains to be seen, with Henderson keen to let the dust settle before committing to future targets.</p>
      <p>He said: "He has run a very good race to be fair, he has done exactly what we all expected to happen and he had a go at him. To be fair, he has got very tired.</p>
      <p>"It was first time out on that (soft) ground. I think you probably can't judge that (trip) and we won't now. I've absolutely no idea what we do next. It's a tough race for them to come into first time out.</p>
      <p>"Nico hasn't seen him that tired before - he has put a lot into it."</p>
      <p>Henderson was keen to give credit to the winner, adding: "It was a great front-running performance. I don't think they have gone as fast as they might have gone and he was always happy to sit on his tail and he couldn't get past him.</p>
      <p>"Fair play, they are fitter and better on the day.</p>
      <p>"We have to look onwards and upwards, but where we go I have no idea. It hasn't answered a lot of questions but we will sort them out.</p>
      <p>"I think first time out would be the time he would be most vulnerable. He has been good first time out before, but we have never had to throw him in as deep as this first time.</p>
      <p>"This was the obvious race to run in. He has still got the time to get to Kempton if that is the route we take and I don't see why we shouldn't, personally, and we will be having a good look at it.</p>
      <p>"Different ground on a different day, you might get a different result."</p>
