        <b>New Tottenham boss <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/managers/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> said winning was what mattered, not how, after <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tottenham-hold-on-to-give-mourinho-victory-in-premier-league-return">Spurs’ 3-2 win at West Ham on Saturday.</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>First-half goals from Son Heung-min and Lucas Moura – both incisive attacks – were added to by Harry Kane’s header after the break as Tottenham won away in the Premier League for the first time in 308 days, even though late goals from Michail Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna skewed the scoreline.</p>
      <p>And afterwards Mourinho, emphasised the mentality he is looking to bring to the club.</p>
      <p>Mourinho speaking to <i>BT Sport:</i> “I was really happy before we conceded the two goals, we were playing well, bringing to the game things we had tried in training. And we had the ball to make it 4-0 and kill the game.</p>
      <p>“We are lucky I have so many years in the Premier League so I told the players at half-time ‘even if we are 3-0 in the 85th minute the game will still be open’.</p>
      <p>“But there were also many factors. The emotions of losing the previous manager, people coming back from national teams and fatigue in the last 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>“The most important thing was to win, no matter how. The boys are happy and that’s what I really wanted.”</p>
      <p>Speaking about Dele All, he added: “‘I’m happy with him, I spent a few minutes with him in training and outside the pitch. And we were saying that the best Dele Alli has to be back.</p>
      <p>“He’s too good to not be one of the best players in the world and not playing with the national team.”</p>
