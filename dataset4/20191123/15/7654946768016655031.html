      <p>Newly released State Department documents confirm phone calls between Rudy Giuliani and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the weeks before President Trump <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/trump-slams-marie-yovanovitch-during-her-testimony-in-house-impeachment-inquiry/">ousted diplomat Marie Yovanovitch</a>.</p>
      <p>More than 100 pages of state department files were released by the watchdog group American Oversight, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/documents-released-ethics-group-show-giuliani-pompeo-contacts-ukraine-ambassador-n1090091">NBC reported.</a></p>
      <p>The records show two phone calls between the men in late March, each of which lasted only a few minutes, but what the men discussed is unknown.</p>
      <p>The documents show “a clear paper trail from Rudy Giuliani to the Oval Office to Secretary Pompeo to facilitate Giuliani’s smear campaign against a US ambassador,” Austin Evers, executive director American Oversight, said.</p>
      <p>“The evidence is only going to get worse for the administration as its stonewall strategy collapses in the face of court orders,” he added, saying the group planned to release more documents.</p>
      <p>The administration’s firing of Yovanovitch is a central focus of the current House impeachment inquiry.</p>
