      <p>Cathy Long, a Louisiana Democrat who won her husband’s U.S. House seat after his death in 1985, has died. She was 95.</p>
      <p>Her family says dementia was the cause.</p>
      <p>Long beat three competitors with 56% of the vote. She didn’t run for reelection to the seat Gillis Long had held for a total of 16 years.</p>
      <p>Mary Catherine Small was born in Dayton, Ohio. She joined the Navy at age 20, during World War II, serving at a Navy hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas.</p>
      <p>The Longs met at Louisiana State University, where both enrolled after the war. They married in 1947.</p>
      <p>Their son, George Long, says his mother probably worked on Gillis Long’s campaign for LSU student body president, as well as all of his later campaigns.</p>
