      <p>A man accused of helping Jussie Smollett pull off a fake hate crime is finally getting some acting work.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>One of the brothers who was allegedly paid by Jussie Smollett to stage an attack on the star has landed a leading movie role.</p>
      <p>Abimbola Osundairo will make his acting debut in the upcoming movie "Friends Family &amp; Lovers" as a main character, Dushon, which is set to screen at the University of Chicago this weekend.</p>
      <p>The low-budget movie is directed and co-written by Michael Ballard, who also co-wrote the Master P produced comedy "I Got the Hook Up 2," and marks Osundairo's first onscreen role.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, former "Empire" star Smollett has been out of the spotlight since he was indicted on 16 counts after it was alleged he had staged a hate attack on himself for publicity.</p>
      <p>He was later charged by police with disorderly conduct and filing a false police report.</p>
      <p>Smollett has denied faking the attack and, in a lawsuit, he is claiming malicious prosecution against the City of Chicago.</p>
      <p>He noted that Abimbola and his brother Olabinjo - the men accused of attacking him - were held for 47 hours and they adamantly denied any involvement in the assault, before later admitting to the attack but claiming it was faked.</p>
      <p>Their lawyer called the actor involving them in the case a sad attempt to falsely smear them.</p>
      <p>Smollett is suing the City, the Osundairo brothers and several officials, including Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson.</p>
