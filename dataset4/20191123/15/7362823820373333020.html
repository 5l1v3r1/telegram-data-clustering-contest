      <p>Burruss, 43, and Tucker — who wed in 2014 — share 3-year-old son Ace and daughters from previous relationships: Kandi’s daughter Riley, 17, and Todd’s daughter Kaela, 22. Their <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/09/27/real-housewives-of-atlanta-star-kandi-burruss-expecting-baby-via-surrogate/">surrogacy journey</a> was documented for “RHOA,” with Kandi sharing that while she wanted more children, her high-risk pregnancy with Ace and history with fibroids (noncancerous growths in the uterus) made her hesitant to carry a child this time around.</p>
      <p>The Tuckers also revealed during the “RHOA” season 12 premiere that their surrogate was initially pregnant with twins, but one of the embryos didn’t make it.</p>

      <p>“We actually was supposed to be having twins, and then one of them didn’t continue,” Burruss said on the show. “I was sad at first, but then I just had to be grateful that the one made it.”</p>
