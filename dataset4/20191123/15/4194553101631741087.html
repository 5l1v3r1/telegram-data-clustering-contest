      <h1>(Video) The push on Lovren that meant VAR disallowed Palace goal</h1>

      <p>Liverpool thought we had conceded a goal to James Tomkins in the 43rd minute, but the VAR thankfully ruled it out at Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>After initially watching the replays, we couldnâ€™t work out why â€“ but it turns out there was definitely a push on Dejan Lovren.</p>
      <p>In fact, the push on Lovren was bigger than the push on Wilf Zaha by Trent Alexander-Arnold in the first place â€“ which gave Crystal Palace a freekick.</p>
      <p>Weâ€™ve been thankful for the VAR and furious at him already this season â€“ so letâ€™s just hope we can take advantage of this situation and go on to win the second-half.</p>
