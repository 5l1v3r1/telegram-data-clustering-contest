      <p>An E.coli outbreak in the U.S. has led to health officials warning people not to eat romaine lettuce grown in Salinas, California.</p>
      <p>The notice comes almost exactly one year after a similar outbreak led to a blanket warning about romaine.</p>
      <p>The latest incident has seen 40 people falling ill across 16 states since 10 November, according to the Centre for Disease Control.</p>
      <p>Officials urged Americans not to eat the leafy green if the label doesn’t say where it was grown.</p>
      <p>They also urged supermarkets and restaurants not to serve or sell the lettuce, unless they’re sure it was grown elsewhere.</p>
      <p>The warning applies to all types of romaine from the Salinas region, include whole heads, hearts and pre-cut salad mixes.</p>

      <p>Laura Gieraltowski, lead investigator of the outbreak at the U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said: ‘We’re concerned this romaine could be in other products.’</p>

      <p>Officials said their investigations into the source of the E.coli outbreak led them to farms in Salinas.</p>
      <p>Salinas is a major growing region for romaine from around April to current time of year, when growing shifts south to Yuma, Arizona.</p>
      <p>After last year’s pre-Thanksgiving outbreak was linked to romaine, the produce industry agreed to voluntarily label the lettuce with harvest regions.</p>
      <p>Health officials said that would make it easier to trace romaine and issue more specific public health warnings when outbreaks happen.</p>
      <p>Officials never identified exactly how romaine might have become contaminated in past outbreaks.</p>
      <p>But another outbreak in spring 2018 that sickened more than 200 people and killed five was traced to tainted irrigation water near a cattle lot.</p>
      <p>E.coli is found in the faeces of animals such as cows.</p>
      <p>Although officials have not made explained why romaine is linked to E.coli, food safety experts have highlighted the difficulties of eliminating risk for produce grown in open fields and eaten raw.</p>
      <p>Industry groups have claimed that they have improved safety measures following last year’s outbreaks, including expanding buffer zones between growing fields and livestock.</p>
