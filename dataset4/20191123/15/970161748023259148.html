      <p>Tony Adams was left dumbfounded by the standard of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a>’s defending after Southampton took an early lead at the Emirates.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a>’s side were without a win in five matches and his confidence-starved team got off the worst possible start against struggling Southampton when Danny Ings fired the visitors ahead after only eight minutes.</p>
      <p>Arsenal’s entire defensive line switched off and failed to notice Nathan Redmond taking a quick free-kick which allowed Ings the chance to run in on goal and beat Bernd Leno with a precise finish.</p>

      <p>‘They’ve tried to play out from the back creating their own problems and they’re not into this game at all hopefully they might get a reaction.’</p>
      <p>Arsenal did manage an equaliser 10 minutes later when Kieran Tierney’s cross located Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the penalty area and when the new club captain’s effort was blocked by Ryan Bertrand, Alexander Lacazette was on hand to pounce on the rebound.</p>
      <p>‘We’ve got fantastic finishers but the other end is shocking,’ added Adams. ‘We need something sorted defensively very quickly.’</p>
