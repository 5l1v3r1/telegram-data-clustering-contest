      <p>Now they want to honour the long-time lorry driver with one last ride before saying their final goodbyes on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>But they were left stunned after their small social media appeal attracted the attention of HGV drivers from all over the country.</p>
      <p>His son Ally Raeburn was blown away by the response with already 90 trucks agreeing to take part.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Scottish Sun the 42-year-old says he would be 'speechless' if the drivers all turn up and is desperate to make his dad proud.</p>
      <p>He said: "We are really overwhelmed by how far one small Facebook post has gone.</p>
      <p>"I had no idea it would, I really didn't expect it to reach the other side of Inverness never mind nationally.</p>
      <p>"We lost my dad a week last Wednesday, it was blood clot and happened really sudden.</p>

        <figcaption>He was a beloved grandpa</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"He had not been well for a while but still it was a big shock no one saw it coming.</p>
      <p>"My dad passed his lorry driving test when he was about the age of 20.</p>
      <p>"He spent his whole life driving lorries but had to retire recently because of his health.</p>

      <p>"That's all he knew, and he loved it.</p>
      <p>"Apart from his family and kids it really was his whole life.</p>
      <p>"We want the lorries to show up at his funeral because he deserves it."</p>
      <p>Ally's wife Shelia Raeburn, 37, who was like a daughter to Dan, posted the appeal on Facebook.</p>
      <p>She said: "Long shot my dad passed away last week suddenly lorry driver all his days went by the name big Dan.</p>
      <p>"We are having his funeral this Wednesday coming in his hometown of Munlochy.</p>
      <p>"I know I am asking a lot but do any of you fellow HGV drivers have spare time at 10/10.30 so we can have a convoy to take my dad to his final resting place from Knockbeck church to Tore cemetery.</p>
      <p>"Thank you from the bottom of my heart."</p>
      <p>Ally and Shelia were both amazed at how many people wanted to help their cause.</p>
      <p>Ally added: "I knew my dad was well known but I didn't realise quite how well until everyone started responding to the post.</p>
      <p>"I didn't realise how much respect everyone had for him it was amazing to see.</p>
      <p>"When I was younger I spent a lot of my youth in the lorry with my dad.</p>
      <p>"I loved it as well it didn't phase me if he was driving a lorry or a car or if we were on a bus, just the sheer fact I was spending time with my dad was great.</p>
      <p>"I grew up surrounded by the lorry driving community to they are all like extended family to me.</p>
      <p>"I would really be speechless if lorries turned up, I think there is 90 confirmed right now.</p>
      <p>"There's lorries coming from all over including Ireland.</p>
      <p>"We are saving all the Facebook responses and printing them off for a little scrap book so we can give my mum or keep for the grand-kids to remember how kind everyone has been."</p>
