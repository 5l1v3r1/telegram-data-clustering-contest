      <p>Martin Odegaard joined Real Sociedad on loan from Los Blancos in the last transfer window and has registered three assists and two goals in 11 appearances.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian is hoping to line-up against his parent club, but insists he has no intention of celebrating if he does find the back of the net.</p>
      <p>“My ankle is much better, I hope to be at the Bernabeu on Saturday,” Odegaard tol El Larguero, as per AS.</p>

      <p>“I played through the pain against Levante and after I think it was the right decision to stop for a bit. Now I feel better.</p>
      <p>“I haven't stopped working in order to return as soon as possible. Playing against Real Madrid is a special match, but I want to play every game.”</p>
      <p>“If I score at the Bernabeu, I won't celebrate. If I score against La Real in the future, I won't either,” he said.</p>
