      <p>"The truth is, Congress should have finished their business on defense appropriations months ago," he said. "But you all know partisan politics and endless investigations have slowed things down in Washington, D.C."</p>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> visited troops at the base on Dec. 26 last year during his first trip to Iraq.</p>
