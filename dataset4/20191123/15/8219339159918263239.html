      <h1>T-Mobile discloses data breach affecting over 1 million subscribers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:24:06+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/chmiller44/" target="_blank">Chance Miller</a></address>
      <p>T-Mobile has officially disclosed a data breach that it says affects more than one million of its customers. As reported by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/22/more-than-1-million-t-mobile-customers-exposed-by-breach/"><i>TechCrunch</i></a>, hackers gained “malicious, unauthorized” access to data from prepaid T-Mobile customers.</p>
      <p>The breached data did not include any financial information, social security numbers, or password data. Instead, it was limited to: name and billing address, phone number, account number, and information about your plan, monthly rate, and features.</p>
      <p>The attack was discovered in early November and “immediately” shutdown, according to T-Mobile. The carrier didn’t disclose any information about how the hack occurred or how long the data was exposed.</p>
      <blockquote>Our Cybersecurity team discovered and shut down malicious, unauthorized access to some information related to your T-Mobile prepaid wireless account. We promptly reported this to authorities. None of your financial data (including credit card information) or social security numbers was involved, and no passwords were compromised.</blockquote>
      <p>Included in that leaked information about your rate, plan, and features was “customer proprietary network information.” Telecommunications regulations require that a carrier notify customers if that information is leaked. Had that information not been included in the breached data, it’s possible T-Mobile wouldn’t have publicly disclosed this hack.</p>
      <p>While T-Mobile did not disclose the exactly number of affected customers, it said that “less than 1.5 percent” of its customers were affected. <i>TechCrunch</i> reports:</p>
      <blockquote>In this case, however, it seems that T-Mobile has disclosed the hack in a fairly prompt manner, though it provided very few details. When I asked, a T-Mobile representative indicated that “less than 1.5 percent” of customers were affected, which of the company’s approximately 75 million users adds up to somewhat over a million.</blockquote>
