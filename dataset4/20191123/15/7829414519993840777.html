      <p>Chinese Premier Li Keqiang sent a congratulatory letter Saturday to the launching ceremony of a BASF smart Verbund project in the city of Zhanjiang, south China's Guangdong Province. <br/><br/>As the first large Verbund petrochemical project solely owned by foreign capital in the country, the project signals that China's further opening-up measures are being implemented. It will push the Sino-German cooperation in the manufacturing sector to a new level, Li said in the letter. <br/><br/>The Chinese government is unswervingly expanding its opening-up and its door to the outside world will open wider and wider, he said. <br/><br/>Li noted that China will accelerate building a market-oriented and internationalized business environment based on the rule of law and give equal treatment to both domestic and foreign-funded enterprises of different ownerships. <br/><br/>China welcomes enterprises from all over the world to seize the opportunities brought by China's greater opening-up, expand cooperation with China and better achieve win-win results, Li said.<br/><b>RELATED ARTICLES:</b></p>
