      <h4>Cardi B opened up about her close family-like relationship with T.I. when discussing the filming of their new hit Netflix competition show ‘Rhythm + Flow’.</h4>
      <p><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/cardi-b/"><b>Cardi B</b></a>, 27, is making it known that no matter what kind of controversy <b>T.I.</b>, 39, sparks, she’ll always be by his side. The rapper spoke with <i>People</i> about her hit Netflix competition show <i>Rhythm + Flow</i>, which she films with both T.I. and <b>Chance the Rapper</b>, 26, and gave details about the close relationship she has with the fellow rappers. “When we first started shooting, I didn’t know what I was gonna get myself into,” she explained when opening up about signing on to judge hip hop contestants. “But every single day I get on set I was just excited to see what the contestants were going to come up with…who’s gonna be next to get eliminated.”</p>
      <p>In addition to admitting she’s “extremely proud” of first season winner <b>D Smoke</b> and finalists, <b>Londynn</b> <b>B</b>, <b>Flawless Real Talk</b> and <b>TrOyMaN</b>, Cardi gushed over the connection she found with T.I. and Chance. “First of all, it was such a good time to film with T.I. and Chance the Rapper,” she said. “We had such a good connection and we had like really good conversations and they were just so funny. It was like when you go to school and you sit with your classmates and y’all at the table, they crack jokes and stuff. That’s how it felt.”</p>
      <p>“Every single time that I see them on social media I be like, ‘That’s my brother, that’s my brother,’” she continued before seemingly hinting at the uproar surrounding T.I. due to his recent comments over his <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/06/ti-daughter-gynecologist-appointments-virginity-hymen-deyjah-harris-interview/">18-year-old daughter, <b>Deyjah</b>‘s virginity</a>. “If they wrong or right, that’s my brother and that’s that.”</p>
      <p>T.I.’s comments about going along to Deyjah’s gynecologist appointments to make sure she’s still a virgin first made waves on Nov. 6, when he talked about it on the<i> Ladies Like U</i>s podcast. He is set to address <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/07/t-i-daughter-deyjah-harris-hymen-comments-response/">the backlash</a> he received from the public when he gives an interview to <b>Jada Pinkett Smith</b> during the Nov. 25 episode of <i>Red Table Talk</i> on Facebook Watch. Deyjah has yet to speak out about the matter.</p>
