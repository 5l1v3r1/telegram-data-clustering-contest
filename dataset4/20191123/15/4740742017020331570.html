      <h1>Prince Charles to have 'stern words' with Prince Andrew after disastrous Newsnight interview, insiders claim</h1>
      <h2>Prince Andrew discussed his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:38:11+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:38</time> by <a rel="author">Russell Myers, Alexander Brock</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/royal-family">Prince Charles</a> has interrupted a tour of New Zealand to have "stern words" with Prince Andrew following his <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/prince-andrews-bbc-newsnight-interview-3554718">disastrous Newsnight interview</a> , royal insiders have claimed.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York discussed his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bbc">BBC</a> interview and has since faced a barrage of criticism.</p>
      <p>The prince confirmed on Wednesday (November 20) that he would step back from public duties as the scandal threatened to engulf the royal family, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bbc">Mirror Online reports</a> .</p>
      <p>While the Queen was spotted riding on horseback with Andrew in Windsor, insiders have said Prince Charles is less than happy with his brother's decision to agree to the interview.</p>
      <p>A Buckingham Palace source said: “The Queen has told Andrew he has her support but it is clear his brother Charles will be having stern words with him when he gets home.</p>

      <p>“Her very public show of support is a clear indication she has forgiven him but he has been ordered to keep in line. The inquests have already begun inside the Palace.</p>
      <p>“Charles will demand to know how on earth this could have been allowed to happen, who was advising Andrew and why he was not consulted about his decision to go ahead with the interview.</p>
      <p>“He has been ordered to step back from royal life until he has unequivocally cleared his name or the Epstein case is over, which could be years. The road to redemption might not only be long, it could be completely blocked off.”</p>
      <p>Andrew's sex accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre claims she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew, 59, three times when she was 17.</p>
      <p>She has recently recorded an interview with BBC Panorama, which is set to air on December 2.</p>
      <p>Andrew has repeatedly denied ever having sexual contact with Virginia.</p>
      <p>Epstein, 66, was found dead in his cell in August as he awaited trial on child sex trafficking charges.</p>
