      <h1>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Boris “does not deserve” to be PM</h1>
      <h2>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Boris Johnson “does not deserve” to be Prime Minister as two of Scotland’s party leaders hit the campaign trail in north east Fife.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:38:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/craigsmith/" target="_blank">Craig Smith</a></address>
      <p>The First Minister was in Leven on Saturday where she visited a hairdressing business to hear how staff are providing free trims for school children from low-income households.</p>
      <p>Wind and rain could not keep the party faithful away from the SNP leader, who was in the town at around 2.30pm with candidate Stephen Gethins.</p>
      <p>Mr Gethins is contesting the North East Fife seat – the UK’s most marginal following his win in 2017 by just two votes – and Mr Grant is hoping to win back the Glenrothes constituency.</p>
      <p>The first minister thanked those who had gathered in the centre of the seaside town and urged members to continue campaigning.</p>
      <p>It comes after her appearance on a BBC Question Time special on Friday evening where she said she could foresee a “less formal” confidence and supply arrangement with the Labour Party if Jeremy Corbyn met her conditions on an independence referendum.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of her campaign visit with SNP candidate Stephen Gethins, she said: “Boris Johnson simply doesn’t deserve the chance to return to Downing Street as Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>“Everything he has done in his short time in the job – including his illegal shutting down of Parliament – shows that.</p>
      <p>“He is taking the Tories further and further to the right, pandering to the worst excesses of Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party.”</p>
      <p>The Scottish Conservatives hit out at Ms Sturgeon’s criticism of the Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: “This is yet more high-handed preaching from a First Minister who seems to think she can tell Scots what to think, but never listens.</p>
      <p>“Nicola Sturgeon slams Boris Johnson, yet at the same time she is quite happy to usher Jeremy Corbyn into Number 10 – whose Labour party faces numerous accusations of anti-Semitism, and which has failed to respond properly to allegations of bullying in its ranks.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in St Andrews, North East Fife MSP Willie Rennie focused on the Liberal Democrats’ anti-Brexit stance, declaring the party the “home of remain”.</p>
      <p>He hit out at the Labour leader for his announcement that he would remain neutral on any future vote on Brexit.</p>
      <p>Mr Rennie said: “Jeremy Corbyn has now made sitting on the fence his official position.</p>
      <p>“It’s unbelievable that he thinks as Prime Minister he can get away without having an opinion on the national crisis of our time.</p>
      <p>“The Liberal Democrats are the home of remain. Labour cannot be trusted.</p>
      <p>“Anyone who wants to put this constitutional chaos to bed needs to join our fight for a brighter future.”</p>
      <p>The North East Fife seat was the closest marginal in 2017, with the Lib Dems losing out by two votes.</p>
      <p>The seat, before being one by Mr Gethins in 2015, was a Liberal stronghold since the 1980s, under Sir Menzies Campbell.</p>
      <p>The largest swing of the vote share in 2017 was to the Conservatives, whose candidate Councillor Tony Miklinski will run again.</p>
      <p>Wendy Haynes will contest the seat for Labour.</p>
