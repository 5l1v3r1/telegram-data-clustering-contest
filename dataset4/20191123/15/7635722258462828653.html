        <b>Elon Musk is down around €700m today after the launch of the company’s new electric pickup truck was marred by an “armour glass” window fail.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-window-fail-927976">Shares in the firm fell</a></b> after two of the new Cybertruck’s windows were smashed during a demonstration of how strong they are.</p>
      <p>After the truck was unveiled in California, Mr Musk told the audience: “You want a truck that's really tough, not fake tough.”</p>
      <p>“You want a truck you can take a sledgehammer to. A truck that won't scratch, that doesn't dent.”</p>

      <p>The truck was not damaged when Tesla designer Franz von Holzhausen hit the door with a sledgehammer; however, the window demonstration was not so successful.</p>
      <p>After he smashed the first one by throwing a metal ball at it, Mr Musk was heard to say, “oh my f****** God.”</p>
      <p>“Maybe that was little too hard,” he added.</p>

      <p>He admitted there was room for improvement in the design, and said the company would fix the problem in the coming months.</p>
      <p>He also share footage of the windows holding firm during a test carried out before the launch</p>

      <p>The ‘Cybertruck’ aims to take a slice of America’s most lucrative car market – with production due to begin in late 2021.</p>
      <p>Built to function on Earth or Mars, the vehicle has the "utility of a truck and the performance of a sports car.”</p>
      <p>It can tow up to 14,000lbs and can accelerate from 0 to 95kph in 6.5 seconds.</p>
      <p>Tesla stocks fell by more than 6% following the launch – cutting Mr Musk's net worth by $768m (€697m) in a single day.</p>
      <p>With a bank balance of around $23.6bn (€21.4bn), he remains the 41st richest person in the world according to Forbes magazine.</p>
