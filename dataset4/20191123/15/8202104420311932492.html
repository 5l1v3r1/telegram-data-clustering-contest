      <h3>Seven years ago, Kevin and Anne MacMillan wanted to give their six young grandchildren a special gift to remind them of the importance of Advent — the 25 days before Christmas.</h3>
      <p>The gift took the form of a 25-chapter story entitled Matzo’s Journey: A Christmas Tail. The chapters were short, sent by email, intended to be read aloud daily during the month of December, “in place of an Advent calendar,” Anne says.</p>

      <p>“We feel very strongly that Christian parents and grandparents have a biblical mandate to help train younger generations for the Lord.”</p>
      <p>Matzo’s Journey is told from the perspective of Matzo, Mary’s pet mouse, and begins with the appearance of the angel Gabriel who announces to Mary the news that she will give birth to Jesus the Saviour. Joseph and his turtledove, Tabitha, need a visit from the same angel before they can truly believe what is to come.</p>
      <p>Antagonists in the story are Festus and Horatio, mangy cats who belong to a Roman Centurion. However, when Matzo and Mary make the journey to Elizabeth’s and Zachariah’s home (on Dan the Donkey, who will later carry Mary to Bethlehem), Matzo finds a friend in Zachariah’s cat, Phoebe.</p>
      <p>“We tried to keep our story as close as possible to the biblical account,” Kevin says. “The theme of it is: With God, nothing is impossible. We want kids to know that you can trust God despite your fears and uncertainty. This story is not only about the Saviour’s birth, it is also a story of learning to trust God.</p>
      <p>Anne’s artist mother, Mary Whicher, added illustrations to the written text.</p>
      <p>Kevin and Anne are part of Mile Two Church (formerly Saskatoon Christian Centre), where Kevin ministers as pastoral director. Mile Two used the MacMillans’ book during Advent that year, and the positive response encouraged them to have the story published.</p>

      <p>It turned out that Matzo’s Journey was the first book in a trilogy.</p>
      <p>The following year Kevin and Anne wrote a follow-up story covering the period immediately after the birth of Jesus, including the visit of the wise men, the family’s flight to Egypt and their return to Nazareth. The next year, the third book follows Jesus’ family (Matzo, too, of course) as they take a holiday to the Sea of Galilee. There they meet a fisherman named Zebedee and Jesus plays with his two little boys, James and John.</p>
      <p>“Our stories are easy to read, but we didn’t dumb down the language,” Kevin says. “We want to teach biblical truths through our stories, and we also try to help children understand Jewish customs of the time.”</p>
      <p>The Matzo stories of the first Christmas had been told, but Anne and Kevin had more Advent stories to tell their grandchildren.</p>
      <p>“We were holidaying at a cottage at Candle Lake, picking blueberries and enjoying the scenery, when the idea came for the Mole Run series,” Anne says.</p>
      <p>The Mole Run trilogy is set in Northern Saskatchewan and features a cast of woodland creatures, including Joel the mole whose family home was destroyed in a spring thaw. His father, Morris the mole, was taken by an osprey, which left Joel to look after the family. He, his mother and siblings escape the flood in a birchbark canoe. Being a worrier, Joel is encouraged by Othello the Owl and his friend Pocket, the ground squirrel. Other characters include Heather and Harriet, the Scottish hedgehog sisters and Clementine the Porcupine who speaks in rhyme.</p>
      <p>The Mole Run story incorporates the Christmas story and also speaks to redemption and the subjects of working together and the value of community.</p>
      <p>As in previous years, the MacMillans’ story was a hit.</p>
      <p>Christmas at Mole Run was published, and two more Mole Run stories followed.</p>

      <p>“Writing the Advent books has been a lot of fun for us, a lot of laughs, and a lot of tears at the redemptive power of Jesus,” Kevin says. “This year’s Advent story is naturally a secret, but I don’t think we’re finished with the Mole Run series. We plan to write more, though they probably won’t be exclusively Christmas books.”</p>
      <p>The books target preschool to age 12.</p>
      <p>Matzo’s Journey and Christmas at Mole Run are both available at Kennedy’s Parable, on Amazon.ca, or through <a href="mailto:kevin.mac@shaw.ca">kevin.mac@shaw.ca</a>.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 23, Kennedy’s Parable will host An Advent Adventure from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. featuring Kevin and Anne MacMillan and their children’s books. The event will include readings, live music (both Kevin and Anne are accomplished musicians), Christmas treats and free giveaways, plus a display of all the animals in the stories.</p>
      <p>Kennedy’s Parable is located at 603B 51st Street in Saskatoon.</p>
      <p>Says Anne: “Our hearts are to see one generation to the next seeing and declaring the goodness of God.”</p>
