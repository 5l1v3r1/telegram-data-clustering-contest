      <h1>Wilkinson aims to heal rifts with Sask. while keeping carbon price</h1>
      <h2>"I’m probably as much a Saskatchewanian as a British Columbian," said the new federal environment minister.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:00:31+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/awhitecrummey" target="_blank">Arthur White-Crummey</a></address>
      <p>Canada’s new environment minister isn’t planning any big reversals on climate policy, but he hopes his focus on technology is the ticket to winning over a skeptical Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Wilkinson, who grew up in this province, replaced Catherine McKenna as the federal minister of environment and climate change in <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/moe-watching-for-shift-in-policy-not-personnel-as-federal-cabinet-shuffled">the Nov. 20 cabinet shuffle</a>.</p>
      <p>McKenna presided over policies that earned the ire of two Saskatchewan premiers; carbon pricing and new environmental assessment legislation have been <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/sask-issues-primer-carbon-pricing-and-the-environment">the most frequent sources of friction</a>.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the Leader-Post, Wilkinson said the federal government has no intention of changing course on those issues.</p>
      <p>“I do think that the carbon pricing issue, by and large, was decided in the election, but I’m more than willing to have a conversation with Premier (Scott) Moe and with others about a range of issues and to try to find solutions that will work,” he said.</p>
      <p>Wilkinson said his views on key files, like the <a href="https://leaderpost.com/feature/energy-city-feeling-powerless-as-coal-phase-out-haunts-estevan">accelerated coal phaseout</a> and methane regulations, are “very much aligned” with McKenna’s. He now wants to take “the next step.”</p>
      <p>“The next step is looking at some of these longer-term opportunities around how do you bridge the divide between a strong climate policy and ensuring that we are addressing issues around energy thoughtfully and sustainably,” Wilkinson said. “That’s the real focus for me.”</p>
      <p>Moe has demanded change on exactly the files where Wilkinson promises continuity, often in combative terms. The new environment minister is urging everyone to calm down and talk it out.</p>
      <p>He knows Moe from their work together on boreal caribou when the premier was Saskatchewan’s environment minister. He finds him “a reasonable person to have conversations with” and hopes they can find common ground, he said.</p>
      <p>“I think we would all do well to try to dial down the rhetoric on all sides — I’m not pointing fingers at Premier Moe — and try to have some substantive conversations about how we can find creative solutions that meet the concerns and aspirations of all regions of the country,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Certainly that includes Saskatchewan and Alberta.”</p>
      <h3>‘I feel very close to Saskatchewan’</h3>
      <p>While some have touted Wilkinson as the closest thing to a Saskatchewan minister in a cabinet that doesn’t have one, he doesn’t make any pretence to represent the province in Parliament.</p>
      <p>“I’m an MP from British Columbia and so I represent the folks who live in my riding,” he said.</p>
      <p>“From a personal perspective, though, I feel very close to Saskatchewan.”</p>
      <p>Wilkinson was raised in Saskatoon, where his parents still live. He went to the University of Saskatchewan and later worked for the NDP provincial government under former premier Roy Romanow as a negotiator at the Charlottetown constitutional talks. He brings his daughters back to visit the province’s north every year.</p>
      <p>“I live in British Columbia, but I’m probably as much a Saskatchewanian as a British Columbian,” he said.</p>
      <p>He retains “some sense of the concerns and aspirations folks there have,” he added. His role as a bureaucrat responsible for federal-provincial relations gives him added insight about how to deal with them, he said.</p>
      <p>“I sat in the provincial chair for a long time and I think that actually helps me in the federal role in terms of trying to understand how to think through and try to address the concerns that provinces bring forward.”</p>
      <h3>Technological breakthroughs could extinguish Prairie fires</h3>
      <p>On the day after the Oct. 21 federal election, Moe channelled the divisions implicit in the results.</p>
      <p>“A fire,” he said, is “burning here in the Prairie provinces.”</p>
      <p>Conservatives had won every seat in Saskatchewan. The Liberals earned just 11.6 per cent of the vote.</p>
      <p>Wilkinson thinks the anger that decimated his party in what he calls “hydrocarbon-producing regions” comes from uncertainty about the future.</p>
      <p>Though he thinks Alberta and Saskatchewan will have to diversify their economies, that doesn’t mean fossil fuels are doomed to obsolescence.</p>
      <p>The answer is technology and “potential breakthroughs” in green innovation, an area Wilkinson said he knows well from his time as an executive with clean tech companies</p>
      <p>“I think there’s enormous opportunities for us to partner on innovative approaches to technologies that allow us to monetize the value of our resources, but do so in a non-polluting way,” he said. “Those are conversations that I’m very interested in having with the province of Saskatchewan and the province of Alberta.”</p>
      <p>The Saskatchewan government has invested heavily in another emissions-reduction technology: carbon capture and storage (CCS). But it’s proven expensive, and <a href="https://leaderpost.com/business/energy/ccs-project-needs-more-time-to-prove-itself-expert-says">there’s no commitment to expand beyond a single unit at Boundary Dam</a>.</p>
      <p>Wilkinson said federal support for CSS technology is “definitely a conversation.”</p>
      <h3>Carbon clash looks set to continue</h3>
      <p>Wilkinson plans to visit the Prairies soon after from returning from a high-level environmental conference in Europe next month.</p>
      <p>While he’d be happy to meet with Moe, Wilkinson might not like what he hears. Pausing the federal carbon backstop is part of Moe’s “new deal for Canada” proposal, though he said <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/we-will-take-what-we-can-get-moe-says-on-prospective-carbon-tax-talks">he’s willing to take what he can get in terms of exemptions and tweaks</a>.</p>
      <p>But Wilkinson said the federal government has no intention of changing its approach.</p>
      <p>Any negotiations will have to take place within the existing framework of the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, the very legislation that <a href="https://leaderpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/supreme-court-rejects-saskatchewans-request-to-delay-carbon-tax-appeal/wcm/b94860f6-7511-4f79-98ba-0cb4cfb43303">Saskatchewan is challenging at the Supreme Court</a>.</p>
      <p>“We’re always open to a conversation if provinces want to put in place their own systems, and Saskatchewan is certainly free to do that in the same way that BC has done and a number of other provinces have done,” he said.</p>
      <p>There may be one narrow area, at least, where consensus is possible. Moe and Saskatchewan NDP leader Ryan Meili have warned about increased costs for farmers forced to dry their grain, using carbon-taxed natural gas, during a wet harvest. Both leaders took the case for an exemption or a rebate to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p>
      <p>According to Wilkinson, Ottawa is listening.</p>
      <p>“We will be having conversations internally about whether there is something that the federal government can do to assist,” he said. “I’m certainly not in a position at this stage to commit anything.”</p>
      <p>The other big gulf between the feds and Prairie premiers is on pipelines, and notably how to approve them. Wilkinson insisted that its Impact Assessment Act, formerly known as Bill C-69, improves on a process that didn’t work. But Moe and Kenny call it the no more pipelines bill.</p>
      <p>Wilkinson said the way the Act is implemented may mean as much as the way it’s written. He said he’s “absolutely open” to talking to provinces about that. The Act itself, however, isn’t going anywhere.</p>
      <p>“That is now the law and, at this point, we don’t intend to revisit that,” he said.</p>
      <h3>Consensus an illusive goal</h3>
      <p>Wilkinson is “bewildered” that conservative politicians oppose the carbon tax.</p>
      <p>“Conservatives, normally, are in favour of market mechanisms,” he said.</p>
      <p>But politics, like economics, is often about trade-offs. In a divided country, the most effective policy to bring down emissions might also be the policy most likely to fuel western resentment.</p>
      <p>Wilkinson, though, refuses to choose between what works and what wins consensus.</p>
      <p>“I would endeavour to do both,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We have to follow the science,” he added. “That being said, there are many different pathways through which we can get to our targets. My approach is to try to find ways to collaborate on developing solutions that can work for everybody, for all regions of the country. Now, we probably will never get to unanimity.</p>
      <p>“But we certainly should be striving to get to unanimity.”</p>
