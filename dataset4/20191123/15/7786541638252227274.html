      <p><b>LONDONÂ (AP)</b> - Jose Mourinho made a winning start to life as Tottenham manager as his new team beat West Ham 3-2 on Saturday for its first away victory in the Premier League in more than 10 months.</p>
      <p>Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane scored in a 13-minute span around halftime at the Olympic Stadium, with Tottenham having a spark to its play rarely seen in the final months of Mauricio Pochettino's reign.</p>
      <p>That ended on Tuesday, allowing for the return of Mourinho to the Premier League nearly a year after he was fired by Manchester United. He had an instant impact.</p>
      <p>"Doesn't matter how, the three points were fundamental for us," Mourinho said. "The boys are happy and that's what I wanted. I wanted them back to happiness."</p>
      <p>The most obvious effect was the improvement of Dele Alli, who shone in the No. 10 role behind Kane and fed Son with a penetrative pass for the opening goal in the 36th minute.</p>
      <p>Another deft piece of play by Alli - this time he flicked the ball to Son while on the ground near the touchline - led to the South Korea forward crossing for Moura to poke home a close-range finish in the 43rd.</p>
      <p>Kane added the third goal four minutes into the second half when he headed in a right-wing cross by Serge Aurier.</p>
      <p>"I like very, very much the first 60 minutes," said Mourinho, who added that fatigue after the international break was a factor in Tottenham allowing West Ham a way back into the game.</p>
      <p>West Ham pulled goals back through substitute Michail Antonio in the 73rd and Angelo Ogbonna in the sixth and final minute of injury time, but Tottenham did enough to earn a first away win in the league since beating Fulham on Jan. 20.</p>
      <p>"I think we are lucky," Mourinho said, "that I have so many years in the Premier League that I told the players at halftime even if we score 3-0, minute 85 the game will be open. I think they understood that."</p>
      <p>On Alli, who has struggled for form this season and hasn't been selected in recent England squads, Mourinho said: "I'm happy with him. I spent a few minutes with him in training and outside the pitch. And we were saying that the best Dele Alli has to be back.</p>
      <p>"He's too good to not be one of the best players in the world and not playing with the national team."</p>
      <p>Spurs was in 14th place, 11 points off the top four, when Mourinho took over but already look a team revitalized under their new manager.</p>
      <p>Mourinho still has to solve an issue with Christian Eriksen, the Denmark playmaker who has been unsettled this season and started on the bench again against West Ham.</p>
      <p>"I need to understand what's in Christian's mind or heart," Mourinho said before kickoff, "and we have to make the right decision for the club."</p>
