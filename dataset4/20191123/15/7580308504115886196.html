      <p>Tesla’s share price plunged by 6% since the close of the market Friday and that takes $768 million out of Musk’s pocket., in a report by TMZ.</p>
      <p>This might be because of the Thursday night’s unveiling of the Cybertruck at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, CA.</p>
      <p>Tesla unveiled its futuristic pickup truck at a promotional event in Los Angeles, but when it came to showing off the vehicle’s durability, things didn’t quite go as planned.</p>
      <p>CEO Elon Musk claimed the car was “bulletproof” against a 9mm handgun. But when he got Tesla’s chief designer to throw a metal ball at one of its armored windows, audible surprise could be heard as the glass smashed twice.</p>
      <p>Musk exclaimed when it first happened. “Well, maybe that was a little too hard.” Design lead Franz Von Holzhausen gave it another shot, this time with another window. Again, the ball cracked the glass pretty badly.</p>
      <p>This was after the executive had already taken a sledgehammer to the side of the truck, striking it multiple times without leaving a scratch.</p>
      <p>Musk was not expecting this to happen and he was pretty shocked at this incident, he said:</p>
      <p>“We threw wrenches, we threw everything even literally the kitchen sink at the glass and it didn’t break. For some weird reason, it broke now,” Musk said, drawing laughs. “I don’t know why. We will fix it in post.”</p>
      <p>This incident clearly affected his net-worth, however, many are expecting him to get back to where he was.</p>
