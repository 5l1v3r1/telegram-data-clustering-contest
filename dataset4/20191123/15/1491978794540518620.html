        <i>Murder charges over sisters aged one and two allegedly left for hours in high temperatures</i>
      </p>
      <p>A woman has been charged with murder over the death of two toddlers who were allegedly left for hours in a car near Brisbane.</p>
      <p>Paramedics were called to a home at Waterford West in Logan about 1.35pm on Saturday but were unable to revive the girls, aged one and two.</p>
      <p>Police said it appeared the sisters had died of exposure to extreme heat. They were attempting to establish how long they had been in a black station wagon parked in the front of the property.</p>
      <p>A 27-year-old Waterford West woman known to the girls was charged late on Saturday with two counts of murder, police said. She will appear at Brisbane magistrates’ court on Monday.</p>
      <p>The Courier-Mail reported that the woman is the children’s mother.</p>
      <p>“The two children exhibited signs of being exposed to extreme heat and that is forming the direction of our investigation,” DI Mark White said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“We are speaking to the parents of those children. It’s a very tragic incident which has occurred.”</p>
      <p>Police said they were offering support to officers who attended the scene. “We are putting a lot of emphasis on supporting our people,” White said.</p>
