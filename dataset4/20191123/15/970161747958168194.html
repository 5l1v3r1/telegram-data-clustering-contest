      <p>All new parents can expect their sleeping pattern to take a hit, but one mum says she’s been unable to get a full night’s rest for the last three decades since her daughter was born.</p>
      <p>Michele Townsend, 58, still hasn’t managed more than a few hours’ shut-eye at a time and sometimes survives on as little as four over the space of an entire week.</p>
      <p>Despite both her children now being grown up with kids of their own, Michele, from Devon, claims to have been plagued with insomnia since her daughter Ami’s birth 32 years ago.</p>
      <p>She initially put it down to being part and parcel of becoming a new mum, but the condition has persisted in the face of dozens of treatments and the grandmother-of-four says it’s ruined her life.</p>

      <p>‘You see your bedroom as the enemy, you just wade through life very slowly, you can’t do anything, you’re trying to be normal but it’s just such an effort,’ Michele said.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a bit like having a half-life. I feel like I’m existing rather living. I try and do the best I can do though.</p>
      <p>‘It’s ruined my life in lots of ways but I’ve tried to not let it win.’</p>

      <p>Michele said her insomnia stretches back to 1987.</p>
      <p>‘It started when my daughter was born, she cried a lot but I just couldn’t sleep at all,’ she added.</p>
      <p>‘I’d go to bed absolutely shattered and just couldn’t sleep. Sometimes I’d go a whole week without more than a few minutes’ sleep.</p>
      <p>‘These days it comes and goes in waves. When it gets bad it can last for ages.’</p>
      <p>Michele has tried hypnosis, sleeping tablets and even yoga to combat her sleeplessness, which has seen her struggle to hold down jobs and even affected her memory.</p>
      <p>‘It’s severely limited the options I’ve had in my life,’ she said.</p>
      <p>She also described having to sleep in another room so as not to keep disturbing her husband.</p>
      <p>‘Obviously we’d prefer to sleep together but at least I don’t have to worry about him snoring,’ she added.</p>

      <p>Despite the toll it’s taken on Michele and her family, doctors have been unable to treat her insomnia.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘It’s exhausting, my family can see in my face whether I’ve slept or not.</p>
      <p>‘I tried to drink too much when I was younger too, just in an effort to get some sleep. I’d have a few drinks but it wouldn’t make any difference. It might give me an hour’s sort of sleep and I’d wake up feeling worse.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve been to workshops and groups, I’ve even tried to do hypnotherapy and take a sleeping tablets.</p>
      <p>‘Nothing has worked. I’m at my wits’ end.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘I just want my life back.’</p>
