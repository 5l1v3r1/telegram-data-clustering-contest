      <p>Ernesto Valverde acknowledged Barcelona were far from convincing against Leganes but was content to come away from Estadio Municipal de Butarque with a win.</p>
      <p>Barca hit back with a couple of second-half goals in Saturday's clash against LaLiga's bottom side after falling behind to Youssef En-Nesyri's impressive early strike.</p>
      <p>Luis Suarez headed in Lionel Messi's floated free-kick and substitute Arturo Vidal completed the comeback 11 minutes from time with a scrappy goal.</p>
      <p>A third away win in four outings for Barca moved them three points clear at the top of LaLiga, but Valverde conceded his side were again below par on their travels.</p>
      <p>"We have to be happy," he told Movistar. "I know it was not a brilliant game and we know it was a difficult game to play because they made it difficult for us.</p>

      <p>"The opponents showed lots of hunger and it was windy, but I don't want to make excuses. They defended well and made it difficult for us to play.</p>
      <p>"We have not had a good start away from home because we have lost three games - that hurts.</p>
      <p>"It was not a brilliant game, but on the other hand we were a goal down - something that has happened to us many times - and we came away with a victory.</p>
      <p>"The positive is that we were losing and won. I recognise that it has been a difficult match, but these are the matches we have to win."</p>
      <p>Valverde fielded an attacking line-up for the trip to the Spanish capital that included Messi, Antoine Griezmann, Suarez and Ousmane Dembele in a 4-2-3-1 formation.</p>
      <p>The front four interchanged throughout but created only one chance of note in the first half, with Suarez being denied by Ivan Cuellar.</p>
      <p>"We have practised with that formation since the players returned from international duty," Valverde said. "We expected to have space in behind, but once Leganes scored that changed.</p>

      <p>"It is clear we have to keep improving. Even when you win there will by a lot of criticism, because people not only look at the result but also the game.</p>
      <p>"But we also did good things today, otherwise we would not have won."</p>
      <p>Vidal scored 22 minutes after being introduced from the bench to make it four goals in nine LaLiga appearances this season.</p>
      <p>The midfielder was initially flagged for offside, but the goal was allowed to stand as the final touch from Dembele's corner came off opposition midfielder Ruben Perez's leg.</p>
      <p>"It's always nice to score when it gives us three points," Vidal told Movistar. "It was a difficult match and we had to rescue the points.</p>
      <p>"It was very cold, we were coming off the back of a break and our opponents were playing for their lives.</p>
      <p>"The new system was the coach's idea. We did not start well but in the second half we controlled play with the system we usually use."</p>
