      <p>Ex-Tottenham players Graham Roberts and Micky Hazard both reacted on Twitter after Jose Mourinho’s reign at Spurs kickstarted with a win over London rivals West Ham.</p>
      <p>New Spurs boss Mourinho watched his side record a 3-2 away victory in the Premier League at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>Heung-Min Son, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane all scored within 49 minutes to put the visitors in complete control.</p>
      <p>Michail Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna both scored for West Ham in the final 20 minutes to make it slightly tense, but overall Mourinho’s arrival made an instant impact.</p>
      <p>Both ex-players were concerned by conceding two late goals and not seeing the game out smoothly, but overall it was a positive day.</p>
      <p>“Great win boys just got bit sloppy when Jose made substitutions. Dele Alli was fantastic today man of the match,” <a href="https://twitter.com/GrahamRoberts4/status/1198247552648450048">Roberts wrote on his personal Twitter account.</a></p>
      <p>“Great win and should have been 6 but what a very poor last 15 mins. Need to see out games far better than that otherwise the great football we played goes unrewarded. All in all first 70 mins very good so we will take it,” <a href="https://twitter.com/1MickyHazard/status/1198246811875590145">Hazard wrote on his personal Twitter account.</a></p>

        <b>TBR’s View:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mourinho sent out a marker by starting a front four of Son, Alli, Moura and Kane for Spurs, which turned out to be a great decision.</p>
      <p>He’s inherited a squad full of top-class quality and some fresh ideas should make them a dangerous outfit.</p>
      <p>But there is no hiding from the fact that the defence has to sharpen up if they want to try close the gap to the Premier League’s top four.</p>
      <p>Fortunately they have a defensive expert in Mourinho that can help that and it will be intriguing to see who he settles on in the coming weeks for his preferred backline.</p>
