      <h1>Co-ordinated homelessness strategy would be ‘dream come true’ for Surrey/White Rock</h1>
      <h2>Abbotsford’s efforts shared with Peninsula Homeless to Housing task force</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/tracy-holmes/" target="_blank">Tracy Holmes</a></address>
      <p>An integrated system developed in Abbotsford to help prevent and respond to homelessness could “absolutely” be scaled to work in a community such as White Rock, members of the Peninsula Homeless to Housing Task Force heard recently.</p>
      <p>Dena Kae Beno, housing and homelessness co-ordinator for the City of Abbotsford, shared her city’s strategy with the local task force during a presentation earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Driven by $400,000 received in 2015 for research, the strategy ultimately arose “out of a very unfortunate incident” that occurred in 2013, Beno said. In June of that year, city workers dumped chicken manure on a site frequented by Abbotsford’s homeless population.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The incident was among actions cited in a lawsuit which resulted in conditions, including that the city allow homeless individuals to camp overnight in some parks.</p>
      <p>But it was also “an impetus” that led to recommendations for the prevention and response system, Beno said.</p>
      <p>“That plan recognized that the city could not solve this alone,” she said.</p>
      <p>The funding received in May 2015 was for the research and development of a co-ordinated intake and referral model. “Collaborative mapping” that followed represented the perspectives of 175 stakeholders, Beno said, and was a critical step in rebuilding relationships in the community.</p>
      <p>“It was a very rich and deep process, because people actually saw their perspectives and their voices represented,” she said. “It was more about, this is a common issue that our societies have.”</p>
      <p>Also important in the process was the realization that steps mapped out were not meant to be tackled alone. Beno said body language took a noticeable shift when that clicked during presentation of the strategy to a room that included Abbotsford city councillors.</p>
      <p>Beno said a community hub centre that opened in Abbotsford combines everything from housing and mental health services to laundry access and a food bank. A focus on interrupting vulnerability earlier – striving to do better at supporting needs ahead of crisis, by building a circle of support around an individual – has gone a long way, she said.</p>
      <p>She recounted a story of one man who was helped through the hub to reconnect with a daughter he hadn’t spoken to in 15 years. The effort “touched about seven of our local agencies,” Beno said.</p>
      <p>And, there is a ripple effect, she said.</p>
      <p>“If we can create a system or infrastructure that can support the most vulnerable in our community, then we’re creating an infrastructure that can support everyone to thrive.”</p>
      <p>Abbotsford, she noted, still has “a lot of work to do.”</p>
      <p>PH2H chair Rick Bayer described the direction Beno chronicled as “very inspiring.”</p>
      <p>“Hopefully, we’ll see something like that come to Surrey and White Rock,” he said.</p>
      <p>Another task force member commented that the co-ordination of agencies and services is “like a dream come true.”</p>
      <p>Beno lauded the role that Abbotsford council has played, describing them as “so engaged.”</p>
      <p>“When the city did lean in, with courage, that’s where our work began,” she said. “I would just encourage you to have those conversations.”</p>
      <p>For municipalities wanting to embark on a similar path, she said it’s key to start with stakeholders and areas of capability, “then you can scale it to the resources you have here.”</p>
