      <h1>The five star restaurant in a quiet and leafy Bristol backwater</h1>
      <h2>The chefs makes everything from scratch, churns his own butter and, of course, bakes his own bread</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Taylor</a></address>
      <p>It’s three years since Jan Ostle and Mary Wilson opened their first restaurant in a quiet and leafy Bristol backwater.</p>
      <p>In that time, they have received rave reviews from a several national critics and entered the restaurant guides that really matter.</p>
      <p>More importantly, they have built up a loyal local following of regulars who return frequently to enjoy Ostle’s innovative seasonal cooking.</p>
      <p>Prior to arriving in Bristol, Ostle worked in some of the UK’s most respected kitchens, including time spent in London at Gordon Ramsay’s flagship Royal Hospital Road and The Square, as well as The Hand and Flowers, Tom Kerridge’s two Michelin star restaurant in Marlow.</p>
      <p>Wilson comes from a family of restaurateurs. The retro stained glass sign in the window of the Redland restaurant is from her parents’ 1980s London bistro of the same name. A nice touch of history repeating itself.</p>
      <p>Despite the success of Wilsons, the owners haven’t rested on their laurels or taken anything for granted. This month has seen a significant and brave change at the restaurant as the usual three-choices-per-course menu has been ditched in favour of one no-choice tasting menu of either seven courses for £50 or four courses for £40.</p>
      <p>Wilson’s background as a biodynamic farmer influences Ostle’s cooking because the couple have their own farm, which supplies a bulk of the vegetables, fruit and herbs (and, in the long term, animals) that arrive in the kitchen each day.</p>
      <p>Fish arrives daily from Cornwall and meat comes from locally sourced ethical farmers. They also use organic growers Leigh Court Farm in Abbots Leigh.</p>
      <p>Such hyper-local sourcing also makes economic sense with Brexit on the horizon and prices of prime produce from Italy, France and Spain rising.</p>
      <p>Ostle is one of the new breed of chefs who takes the ‘waste’ from the cooking process and re-imagines it back into other dishes.</p>
      <p>He makes everything from scratch, churns his own butter and, of course, bakes his own bread - seriously good malty bread made with heritage English grains.</p>

      <p>As well as bread and butter, a meal begins with ‘snacks’ including homemade salami of rare-breed Mangalitza pork, hot nuggets of pheasant and fennel seed with a dill mayo dip, a dainty but full-flavoured chestnut mushroom custard tartlet topped with Cornish Gouda cheese and the chef’s celebrated red mullet soup.</p>
      <h3>'A kebab elevated to business class'</h3>
      <p>Many dishes on the new menu follow what Ostle calls a ‘cyclical’ cooking style. Raw mackerel with a confit rock oyster is served with a dressing made from smoked mackerel bones and radishes.</p>
      <p>A dish simply described as ‘Wiltshire truffle, potato and onion’ turns out to be the silkiest, creamiest mash served with a deep-flavoured, bone-warming onion broth topped with a generous flurry of grated truffle. In the bowl, it looks like a tiramisu but the ambrosial flavour is intensely savoury and the texture featherlight. It’s a stunning dish.</p>
      <p>There’s humour, too, in a dish of partridge and smoked eel. Skewered on a bay leaf branch, the bite-size pieces of pink and juicy partridge are sandwiched between lozenges of rich and oily smoked eel. It’s essentially a kebab elevated to business class.</p>
      <p>A precisely cooked piece of muscular, milk-white turbot has a gentle sweetness mirrored by a creamy cauliflower purée napped by concentrated pheasant juices.</p>
      <p>Ostle is passionate about cooking game and a breast and leg of pigeon is roasted with care to rosy pink perfection and teamed with sweet and earthy beetroot. It’s a perfect marriage and the essence of autumn.</p>

      <p>A striking pumpkin ice cream is topped with fragrant thyme leaves and crunchy puffed rice, its sweet but vegetal flavour paving the way for a closing soufflé that stands proud and lofty in its ramekin, crowned with a scoop of mellow, honeyed quince sorbet.</p>
      <p>Wilsons has retained the popular £10 plat du jour lunch deal and they also have a vegetarian tasting menu but the new no-choice menu is still a major shift for any restaurant, especially a small, family-run place in the backstreets of Bristol.</p>
      <p>The new style is an admirable statement of intent from its owners, who want to make sustainability and local sourcing the focus of the menu.</p>
      <h3>THE VERDICT:</h3>
      <p>Intelligent dishes with a firm sense of place created by a chef who cooks from the heart as well as with a conscience, Wilson’s deserves its reputation as one of Bristol’s go-to restaurants.</p>
      <h3>RATINGS:</h3>
      <p>Overall: 5</p>
      <p>Food: 5</p>
      <p>Service: 5</p>
      <p>Ambience: 4</p>
      <p>Value: 5</p>
