      <h1>Robert De Niro: Pete Buttigieg Has 'The Best' Shot to Defeat 'Piece of S**t' Trump</h1>
      <h2>It should come as no surprise that actor Robert De Niro thinks President Donald Trump is a “piece of shit.” But it might shock some to know who the Taxi Driver star believes is the Democratic candidate best capable of beating Trump in 2020.</h2>

      <p>“Buttigieg I like a lot,” De Niro <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/robert-de-niro-on-piece-of-sht-trump-whether-the-mob-killed-jfk-and-why-buttigieg-is-what-we-need-now?ref=wrap">told</a> the Daily Beast. “He’s got all the credentials—Rhodes Scholar, Afghanistan veteran—even though he’s young, and if he could get a chance it could be something special, I think.”</p>
      <p>“As a gay person, he’s someone who comes from a marginalized community, so people from other ethnic groups can identify with him, even if they’re not gay, because they know what it’s like,” De Niro <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/robert-de-niro-on-piece-of-sht-trump-whether-the-mob-killed-jfk-and-why-buttigieg-is-what-we-need-now?ref=wrap">said</a>, not noting, however, that Buttigieg has long struggled to garner support from both black and Latino voters. The South Bend, Indiana, mayor, for instance, is <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/20/pete-buttigieg-my-gay-rights-struggle-connects-me-to-black-voters/">polling</a> at “zero percent among black voters” in the state of South Carolina, according to fresh data from Quinnipiac University.</p>
      <p>(Insult to injury? A black South Bend city councilman just <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/22/black-south-bend-leader-endorses-biden-over-buttigieg-072885">endorsed</a> Joe Biden over Buttigiege, citing the mayor’s low support from black voters).</p>
      <p>“I think he’s the best for what we need now. I have friends who really like him a lot, as I do,” De Niro said. “With Obama, he had the middle name “Hussein” and a lot of things that people tried to use against him—including Trump with the whole stupid “birther” thing—and he went right through it. It could happen with Buttigieg. And there’s Bloomberg.”</p>
      <p>For De Niro, Biden “means well … he’s a guy who would do the right thing, make the right decision.” As for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (D-VT), the <i>Irishman </i>star thinks they are “too extreme” to defeat Trump. But former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg (who just <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/michael-bloomberg-to-spend-33m-in-a-single-week-on-2020-tv-ads/">purchased</a> $33 million in TV ads) “can run the country as an adult.”</p>
      <p>So far, the actor’s track record on endorsements for those seeking to defeat Donald Trump at the ballot box isn’t good. Robert De Niro <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/04/03/here-comes-hollywood-robert-de-niro-endorses-hillary-clinton/">endorsed</a> two-time failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in April 2015, saying at the time that “she has earned the right to be president.”</p>
