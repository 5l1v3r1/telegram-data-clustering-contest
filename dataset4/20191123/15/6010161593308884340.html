      <h1>Epic Games Store’s Black Friday sale has great offers on Red Dead Redemption 2, Borderlands 3 and more</h1>

      <p>By now, you’re likely aware that we’re entering the busiest shopping period of the year. Online retailers around the globe are trying to coax customers to their checkout with promises of same-day delivery and price match guarantees. And rather than buck the trend, the <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/collection/november-2019-sale">Epic Games Store is having its own Black Friday sale</a> at the minute, and all PC players should have a little browse because there’s plenty in here that’s worth a look.</p>
      <p>Firstly, the recently-released cowboy classic, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/05/red-dead-redemption-2-review/">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, is currently on sale for £43.99. Sure, the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/13/red-dead-redemption-2-update-will-address-stuttering-issue/">PC launch hasn’t gone quite as smooth as Rockstar would’ve hoped</a>, but a couple of <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/20/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-patch-4-6-core-stuttering-core-drain-framerate/">updates have steadied the horse,</a> and it appears RDR2 is finally at the stage it probably should’ve been at when it released two weeks ago. So, now is as good a time as any to take the leap and experience a game Kirk called “innovative, surprising, stunning, dramatic, and generous” in his review from last year.</p>
      <p>The post-apocalyptic shooter <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/02/13/metro-exodus-review/">Metro Exodus</a> has also had its price slashed; you can grab the sequel to 2013’s Metro Last Light for only £17.49 at the minute. Sure, it has its issues, but Alex was rather fond of the 4A Games joint when he reviewed it back in February, and you may be too if you give it a go.</p>
      <p>Another game that’s worth a look is <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/09/18/borderlands-3-review/">Borderlands 3</a>. The shlooter took a bit of a battering from some for its childish humour, but garnered much acclaim for how it played. And rightfully so. Its diverse weaponry and enemy variety make for a really fun time; just ignore the dialogue exchanges that revolve around poo and you’ll be alright.</p>
      <p>There’s plenty of other little delights if you poke about it: What The Golf? – the terrific golf game that isn’t actually a game about golf – is currently on sale for £10.49, the enjoyable sci-fi RPG <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/23/outer-worlds-review/">The Outer Worlds</a> has dropped in price to £37.49, and the atmospheric space puzzler Observation has had a tenner knocked off its regular price. Here are some of the best deals we were able to find.</p>
