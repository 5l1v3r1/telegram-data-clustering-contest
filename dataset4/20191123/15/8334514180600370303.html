      <p>DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzania summoned Canada’s envoy to protest after an aircraft set to be delivered to state-owned Air Tanzania was impounded in a land compensation dispute, the East African country’s government said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The case relates to a lawsuit filed by a retired Tanzanian farmer who has claimed compensation over what he says was the expropriation of his land several decades ago.</p>
      <p>Foreign affairs minister Palamagamba Kabudi said the new aircraft, a DHC Dash 8-400 turboprop, was impounded in Canada this week after an individual filed a claim in court against the Tanzanian government.</p>
      <p>“I summoned Canada’s high commissioner yesterday and told her unequivocally ... that the Tanzanian government has been disappointed and angered by the move,” Tanzania’s foreign affairs minister Palamagamba Kabudi said at a swearing-in ceremony in the capital Dodoma for the country’s new ambassadors.</p>
      <p>The minister said Tanzania had hired lawyers in Canada to defend it against the action, noting it was from the same individual who filed a lawsuit in a South African court claiming he was owed compensation by the government.</p>
      <p>South African authorities in August impounded an Airbus 220-300 leased by Air Tanzania, though a court later ordered the release of the aircraft. The retired farmer’s lawyers in that action said he had asked not to be named.</p>
      <p>Under President John Magufuli, who took office in 2015, Tanzania has spent hundreds of millions of dollars purchasing at least nine new planes for the loss-making state carrier since 2016.</p>
      <p>The airline’s existing fleet, which is leased from the state-run Tanzania Government Flight Agency (TGFA), includes two Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners, two Airbus A220-300s and three DHC Dash 8-400s.</p>
      <p>Air Tanzania has previously had planes targeted in legal actions. In 2017, Canadian construction firm Stirling Civil Engineering Ltd seized one of its new Q400 turboprop planes in Canada over a $38 million lawsuit, before it had been delivered.</p>
      <p>The Q400 was released in March 2018 after President John Magufuli sent his prime minister and attorney general to Canada to negotiate its release.</p>
      <p>No details were given at the time, but aviation sources said the government had reached a financial settlement to secure the aircraft.</p>
