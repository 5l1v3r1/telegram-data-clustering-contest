      <p>“We represent the 40 per cent, we represent the 40 per cent!”</p>
      <p>The chant was shouted by a group of protesters outside the Kelowna RCMP detachment Saturday morning, responding to the 40 per cent of sexual assault cases the local police force <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/269403/mayor-confident-in-rcmp">dismissed as “unfounded”</a> last year. The provincial average was just 15 per cent.</p>
      <p>One of the organizer of Saturday's protest was <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/270937/victimized-by-the-rcmp">Aden Withers</a>, whose own case was dismissed after Withers reported a sexual assault to the Kelowna RCMP in 2012.</p>
      <p>The case gained national attention after a <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/256862/Cop-makes-teen-relive-rape">video of Withers' interrogation</a> came to light, when Withers filed a civil suit against the interrogating officer.</p>
      <p>“Const. Kenneth Hall was disgustingly and abhorrently and degradingly questioning me,” Withers said to those gathered outside the detachment Saturday.</p>
      <p>“I'm here today because I want Const. Kent Hall and all his colleagues to know that we do not support rape culture!”</p>
      <p>As a result of the high percentage of unfounded cases in Kelowna, the national RCMP Sexual Assault Review Team is <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/270175/unfounded-cases-reviewed">reviewing all sexual assault cases</a> in Kelowna in 2018 and 2019.</p>
      <p>“I'm here because mothers, sisters, daughters, friends, lovers get raped ... it destroys a women's life. ” said Sherry Dahl, who attended Saturday's protest with her husband.</p>
      <p>“Forty per cent of the women who go to the police and say 'I've been raped,' are ignored. Nothing happens as a result ... Our society is not safe for women.”</p>
      <p>Dahl said she was disappointed that more men didn't attend Saturday's protest.</p>
      <p>“Men who see men treating women poorly, they should step up and say 'no, that's is not Ok, that is not alright.”</p>
