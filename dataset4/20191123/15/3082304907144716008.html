        <b>Matching Seve Ballesteros to win the European Tour’s season-ending prize would be an honour for Jon Rahm.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jon Rahm has goosebumps over the thought of emulating the great Seve Ballesteros and becoming Race to Dubai champion.</p>
      <p>A six-under-par 66 on Saturday left Rahm in a tie for first alongside Mike Lorenzo-Vera at the DP World Tour Championship after three rounds and in pole position to win the season-long battle for the European Tour’s best player.</p>
      <p>Ballesteros is the only other Spaniard to have achieved the honour, doing so six times between 1976 and 1991 when it was known as the Order of Merit.</p>
      <p>It is an honour that has eluded such Spanish talents as Sergio Garcia, Jose Maria Olazabal and Miguel Angel Jimenez, and Rahm is determined to grasp his opportunity.</p>
      <p>“It gives me goosebumps to think about that,” he said in quotes reported by the European Tour.</p>
      <p>“I’ve said it many times, as a Spaniard, any time you join or you have the chance to put your name on a list where there’s only one name and that name is Seve, it’s pretty impactful.</p>
      <p>“It’s really emotional for all of us. To think not even Sergio or Miguel Angel or Olly or many other great players couldn’t get it done.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard to believe that I have the chance to be the second. I’m just going to try to enjoy the afternoon. There’s still 18 more holes to play.”</p>

      <p>Rory McIlroy looms as an ominous presence just two shots off the pace, with Tommy Fleetwood – Rahm’s rival in the Race to Dubai – four shots off the lead.</p>
      <p>McIlroy, a three-time Race to Dubai victor, recovered from a disappointing 74 on Friday to shoot himself back into contention for the World Tour Championship trophy with a 65.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got Tommy and Jon up there obviously and Mike’s holding steady at the top. He played wonderfully yesterday. I played with him and seems like he’s doing a similar thing today,” McIlroy said.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to have to go out there and shoot a similar score tomorrow to do what I did today to really have a chance. But I’m just really pleased that I got myself back in the golf tournament.”</p>
