      <p>The<a href="http://concisenews.global/education/"> University of Nigeria</a> (UNN) Nsukka has withdrawn its approval on the venue for a witchcraft conference scheduled to hold in the university premises.</p>
      <p><a href="http://concisenews.global/">Concise News</a> reports that UNN earlier granted approval for the use of its Energy Centre for the event which has been generating mixed reactions.</p>
      <p>The director of the centre wrote a disapproval letter to the conference organisers after the Christian students and the Christian Association of Nigeria <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/21/what-can-said-about-witchcraft-conference-planned-to-hold-at-unn/">(CAN)  kicked against the conference</a> which is scheduled to hold between November 26 and November 27.</p>
      <p>This has prompted CAN to call for a one-day prayer by all Christians to avert the conference.</p>
      <p>CAN in a statement issued by its Chairman in the South-East, Bishop Dr. Goddy Okafor, demanded that the programme be called off immediately.</p>
      <p>Okafor said, “I call on all Heads of Blocks, State Chairmen and other Stakeholders of Christian Association of Nigeria South-East Zone to take up aggressive prayers against the planned convention of Witches and Wizards slated to hold on November 26 at UNN.</p>
      <p>“This convention is not of God and must not hold in Jesus name. Exodus 22:18 says, ‘Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live’.</p>
      <p>“I hereby direct, all Christian Churches in South East of Nigeria to take up lamentation and pray against this evil movement in all our churches this coming Sunday.</p>
      <p>Posters pasted by Christian students on the campus decried the conference. The posters bear the messages: “Say No to the meeting of witches and wizards!!! We are (a) Christian community. Don’t pollute our environment please!” “University of Nigeria belongs to Jesus. So witches and wizards, No way!! No Vacancy!!!” “We plead the blood of Jesus over the University of Nigeria. Hence we reject all forms of witchcraft overtly or covertly in Jesus’ Name, Amen”.</p>
