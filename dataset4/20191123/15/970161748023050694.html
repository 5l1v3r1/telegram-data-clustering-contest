      <p>Guns N’ Roses’s Not In This Lifetime tour has raked in more than half a billion dollars in the three-year run.</p>
      <p>Basically, Axl Rose, Slash and Duff McKagan are smashing it.</p>
      <p>According to reports, the Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door singers’ three-year stint on the road has grossed $584.2 million (£455.1m).</p>
      <p>The tour, which kicked off way back in 2016, has come to an end and with 5,371,891 <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tickets/">tickets</a> sold, making it the third highest-grossing tour, according to Billboard Boxscore.</p>
      <p>Not too shabby…</p>
      <p>However, GNR have a long way to go <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/03/ed-sheeran-knocks-u2-off-top-spot-highest-grossing-tour-ever-buzzing-10510143/">to knock Ed Sheeran off the top spot</a> for the highest ever grossing stint.</p>

      <p>The Thinking Out Loud singer’s time on the road with his Divide album has taken up the mantel, banking around $750million (£584m).</p>

      <p>But if any act can push him off the top spot, we’re guessing it’ll be Guns.</p>
      <p>And that may happen sooner than we think, as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/13/slash-confirms-new-guns-n-roses-album-works-compares-music-industry-wild-west-10735347/">Slash confirmed the band are planning to bless us with another album</a> full of new music.</p>
      <p>‘I think at the end of the day, everybody wants to have a full album released. I don’t think that’s really changed all that much,’ he said during an appearance on Sirius XM.</p>

      <p>‘But there’s a different way of putting stuff out initially nowadays more so than … I mean, there’s always been the single, but now you sort of look at that preliminary release a little bit differently now. All things considered, it’s like the Wild West out there; there is no formula for any of it.</p>
      <p>‘I haven’t seen any routine kind of thing that works. I mean, you can do any one of a million different things to releasing a record. But at the end of the day, I think that we will ultimately release a full album.’</p>
      <p>The 54-year-old also revealed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/09/26/guns-n-roses-slash-confirms-new-album-is-on-the-way-after-25-years-axl-has-a-ton-he-recorded-already-7980571/">the songwriting process has included the whole band</a>, which has been ‘really exciting’.</p>
      <p>‘Obviously, everybody knows that we’re working on new material, which is really exciting, and so, that’s really primarily what the focus is,’ he added.</p>

      <p>‘Everybody has been sort of, like, when we’re in town, working on it. And then when we’re out of town, obviously not. So it’s been that kind of thing.’</p>
      <p>Bring. It. On.</p>
