      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> praised the contribution of Dele Alli as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> enjoyed their first away win in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> since January.</p>
      <p>In his first match in charge since replacing the outgoing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> earlier this week, Spurs raced into a two-goal advantage and made the game safe early in the second half thanks to Harry Kane’s header.</p>
      <p>West Ham rallied late on to reduce the margin of defeat to a single goal, but it was Alli, playing in a more advanced role, who caught the eye of his new manager.</p>
      <p>Mourinho said: ‘I’m happy with him, I spent a few minutes with him in training and outside the pitch. And we were saying that the best Dele Alli has to be back.</p>
      <p>‘He’s too good to not be one of the best players in the world and not playing with the national team.</p>

      <p>‘He has to start from now, has to start now without injuries and start with some stability from tactical point of view.’</p>
      <p>Alli, himself, insisted his performances in recent weeks suggested his form had been steadily improving, despite having been left out of England’s most recent squad, but insists there is still much more to come.</p>
      <p>‘It’s been a very tough week for us emotionally,’ he said. ‘We’ve spent a long time with Poch and we were very sad but we had a job to do. We had to go out for the fans and try and stay as positive as we can.</p>
      <p>‘I think I have been performing well so far this season but I need to get better than my old form and get to my best.</p>
      <p>‘We have to carry on momentum and keep winning, we need to start that from now. There is still a lot to work on and we need to improve from now on.’</p>
