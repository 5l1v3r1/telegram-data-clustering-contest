      <p>The Sumatran rhinoceros has become extinct in Malaysia after the last of the species in the country died of cancer.</p>
      <p>The Wildlife Department in eastern Sabah state on Borneo said the rhino, named Iman, suffered with a number of uterine tumours since her capture in March 2014.</p>
      <p>Department director Augustine Tuuga said the 25-year-old was in ‘significant pain’ from growing pressure of the lumps to her bladder, but that her death came sooner than expected.</p>
      <p>It follows that of the country’s only male rhino six months ago in Sabah.</p>
      <p>Another female also died in captivity there in 2017.</p>

      <p>Efforts to breed them have been futile but Sabah authorities have harvested their cells for possible reproduction.</p>
      <p>The state environment minister Christina Liew said: ‘Despite us knowing that this would happen sooner rather than later, we are so very saddened by this news.’</p>

      <p>She said Iman had escaped death several times over the past few years due to sudden massive blood loss.</p>
      <p>But wildlife officials managed to nurse her back to health and obtained her egg cells for a possible collaboration with Indonesia to reproduce the critically endangered species through artificial insemination, she added.</p>

      <p>The Sumatran rhino is the smallest of the rhinoceros species and the only one with two horns.</p>
      <p>They once roamed across Asia as far as India, but its numbers have shrunk drastically due to deforestation and poaching.</p>
      <p>The World Wildlife Fund estimates there are only about 80 left, mostly living in the wild in Sumatra and Borneo.</p>
