      <p>Another person, 24-year-old Antony Andrade, exited the Ford pickup and entered the victim's vehicle, then fled the scene.</p>
      <p>The victim's phone was still in her vehicle, which allowed her to track her vehicle with GPS. She then provided the location to the sheriff's office.</p>
      <p>The victim's vehicle was recovered at the intersection of W Hillsborough Ave. and Elliott Drive. Andrade was still in the car and was later arrested.</p>
      <p>Detectives are still looking for the driver and passenger of the Ford pickup, as they were also involved in the carjacking.</p>
