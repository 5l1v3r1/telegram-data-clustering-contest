      <h1>Sunday's Best Bet: Oliver the star attraction in Cary Grant Stakes</h1>

      <p>Sundayâ€™s 8th race from Del Mar is the $100,000 Cary Grant Stakes for California-bred 3-year-olds and up dashing seven furlongs on the main track (Post Time - 7:03 p.m. ET).</p>

      <p>#5 OLIVER (5-2) turns back and returns to the state bred ranks. The 2-time local winner fired trifecta shots in his last four dirt sprints. I like the rider switch to Abel Cedillo, and he looks better than these at this distance. He is the only sophomore in this lineup, and he beat older state bred stakes foes Sept 7.</p>
      <p>#3 Fashionably Fast (8-5) is 3-for-3 since removing blinkers for quality low profile trainer Dean Pederson, and two of those wins were at Del Mar over the summer. The extended sprint distance is the biggest question. He seems best up to 6.5 furlongs, but he is razor sharp and fresh.</p>
      <p>#2 Grinning Tiger (3-1) enters in decent form and is 6-for-14 on fast dirt. I am not sure about seven panels.</p>
      <p>#1 Ultimate Bango (7-2) got plenty of pace help vs. three rivals in his last-to-first romp in a 5.5f turf sprint at Santa Anita Oct. 14. He was 3rd in his lone dirt try and should not have any problems with this distance. The dirt surface is the biggest question.</p>
