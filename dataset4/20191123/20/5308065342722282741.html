      <p>Rumours are rife in Malaysia that PKR leader and PM-in-waiting Anwar Ibrahim will be given a cabinet post but Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir shot down the idea saying no decision is made yet.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t made a decision yet,” Dr Mahathir said on Saturday to reporters after chairing Pakatan Harapan’s presidential council meeting this evening.</p>
      <p>But he added, “Everything is possible.”</p>
      <p>In a short response, Anwar said: “But I did not apply.”</p>

      <p>This is not the first time Anwar said he did not apply for a post in Mahathir’s cabinet, but he did not say it will not be welcomed.</p>
      <p>The Malaysian social media scene was abuzz with fake reports that Anwar will be appointed as the new deputy Prime Minister, a role he last held right before he was sent to jail by Mahathir in 1998.</p>
      <p>Last week Dr Mahathir mentioned he might consider a cabinet reshuffle, and this went viral on social media too..</p>
      <p>But the ‘euphoria’ of a change in the Pakatan Harapan cabinet lineup was short-lived after Dr Mahathir said any reshuffle will take place after November 2020.</p>
      <p>Speaking of responses from Cabinet ministers on the news of a possible reshuffle, Mahathir said, “Well, they are not against it. They didn’t say please don’t reshuffle me.”</p>

        <b>Unhappiness against Pakatan</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Pakatan Harapan leadership met on Saturday to discuss the massive defeat the coalition registered in the Johor by-election. The PH candidate was beaten by a whopping and shocking 15,000 margin. A defeat that left Dr Mahathir bloody-nosed as it is the first time as a sitting PM his party lost with such a big margin.</p>
      <p>After the meeting on Saturday, Mahathir also said the government will look into what the people were unhappy about regarding the various ministries.</p>
      <p>“If they feel that we have not done anything, we will try to correct it or if they point out that we must reshuffle, we will consider.”</p>
      <p>Analysing the defeat, Dr Mahathir said the people were unhappy with the PH coalition partner the Democratic Action Party.</p>
      <p>“So there appears to be a balance, both sides are unsatisfied. We cannot satisfy everyone, but the situation now is that people are not satisfied because we are being fair to both sides.”</p>
      <p>He also said the <a href="https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/11/23/dap-at-centre-of-voter-unhappiness-says-dr-m/">Malays felt the DAP</a> had taken over the PH and Chinese voters felt he was personally manhandling the DAP.</p>
