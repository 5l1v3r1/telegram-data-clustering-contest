      <p>The protests led to some celebrity support.</p>
      <p>"I'm proud to support the students of @DivestHarvard and @FossilFreeYale who disrupted #HarvardYale today to call for fossil fuel divestment," actress Alyssa Milano <a href="https://twitter.com/Alyssa_Milano/status/1198311863206809600">wrote on Twitter</a>. "When our richest universities are invested in the destruction of the planet #NobodyWins."</p>
      <p>Actress Daryl Hannah congratulated the student activists and called on Yale and Harvard "to divest." "When it comes to the further destruction of our planet #nobodywins," she tweeted.</p>
