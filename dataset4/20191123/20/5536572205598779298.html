      <p>The Houston Rockets lost a close game to the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday night, but things almost got physical, not between the teams, but between a family member of the Rockets and a player on the Clippers.</p>
      <p>After that buzzer, Russell Westbrook‘s brother Raynard reportedly rushed the court in an attempt to confront Montrezl Harrell and was promptly escorted out of the arena by security, according to Yahoo Sports.</p>

      <p>“The brother of Houston Rockets star Russell Westbrook was escorted out of Staples Center because of his role in a heated verbal confrontation with Los Angeles Clippers forward Montrezl Harrell and for “rushing the court” at the end of Friday night’s game, security officials told Yahoo Sports.</p>
      <p>Raynard Westbrook, the younger brother of the Rockets’ star, and Harrell participated in an intense back and forth as both teams were headed to the locker room.</p>
      <p>There was some distance between the two until Raynard stepped on the court to continue the banter, and arena security cut off his path and directed him off the court.</p>
      <p>While continuing the verbal sparring, Raynard was moved along the seats behind the basket closest to the Clippers’ bench before being asked to exit the arena.”</p>
