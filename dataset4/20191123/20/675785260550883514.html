      <h1>Martin Bashir in talks for new late-night chat show after X Factor: Celebrity</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The veteran journalist has sat down for hard-hitting intensive interviews with Princess Diana, Michael Barrymore, Jeffrey Archer and Michael Jackson</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:40:50+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:40</time> by <a rel="author">Janine Yaqoob</a></address>
      <p>He’s responsible for some of the past decade’s most memorable interviews.</p>
      <p>And now, journalist Martin Bashir is set to grill the biggest names in the world on his own chat show.</p>
      <p>Talk TV can reveal he is in talks with ITV bosses about fronting a new programme doing what he does best.</p>
      <p>Martin’s jaw-dropping interview with Princess Diana in 1995 was likened to the recent explosive chat with Prince Andrew.</p>
      <p>A source said: “Martin’s interview with Princess Diana has gone down in history. The world saw nothing like it until Prince Andrew’s car-crash chat with Emily Maitlis this month.</p>

      <p>“Martin is not afraid to ask tough questions and gets revelatory stories from the big names he encounters. ITV know this would make gripping telly and get the world talking.”</p>
      <p>Martin, 56, started out as a journalist in 1986 and worked for the BBC until 1999 on programmes including Songs of Praise and Panorama. He also worked on features for ITV’s Tonight with Trevor McDonald.</p>
      <p>The pinnacle of his career came when he interviewed Princess Diana for the BBC’s Panorama programme about her failed marriage to Prince Charles.</p>
      <p>She secretly invited him into Kensington Palace to give her side of the story and made sensational claims about the royal family.</p>
      <p>From spilling the beans about Prince Charles’s affair with Camilla to admitting to her own infidelities, the interview changed the course of royal history.</p>
      <p>He also conducted interviews with Michael Barrymore, Jeffrey Archer, Major Charles Ingram and Michael Jackson.</p>
      <p>Currently the BBC’s religious affairs correspondent, Martin tried his luck on Celebrity <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> – but failed to make the final.</p>
