      <p>The Emmerdale star is the hot favourite to win the BBC One contest, but it seems it hasn't come without its sacrifices.</p>
      <p>Kelvin, who played Andy Sugden on the soap for 20 years, posed up in his boxer shorts to show the huge purple bruises all over his legs.</p>
      <p>Sharing is on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> , he said: "Rugby? No. Paintball? No. Dancing? Yes #didimentionimbruised? #soft #getoveritkelvin #strictly"</p>
      <p>Confused pal <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-ryan-thomas-celebrity-big-13078203">Ryan Thomas</a> asked: "Hows that happened"</p>
      <p>While his professional partner Oti Mabuse told him: "Don’t be a queen about it... get dressed and let’s go dance"</p>

      <p>Some found the photo a little distracting though.</p>
      <p>One said: "Ok hands up who zoomed in?..."</p>
      <p>And another cheekily commented: "Great legs and pouch though"</p>
      <p>Kelvin, 35, has been the hot favourite to win the contest ever since he joined as Jamie Laing's replacement.</p>
      <p>Made In Chelsea star Jamie was forced to pull out of the contest after being injured during the filming of the launch show.</p>
      <p>Last week, Kelvin spoke about how much performing at Blackpool's iconic Tower meant to him.</p>

      <p>He said: "It’s made the hairs go up on my neck just thinking about it.</p>
      <p>"Before the dawn of budget airlines, you couldn’t think of going to Spain, it was just too expensive. We would go to Blackpool for our holidays.</p>
      <p>"So the Blackpool Tower, Winter Gardens, that’s all very much part of my childhood. I just remember it as an amazing resort, absolutely buzzing.</p>

      <p>"I’ve been to the ballroom on a Friday afternoon, there might have been a few couples getting up and doing a little dance, you’d sit there, have your cup of tea, and random people would just get up. I just remember thinking how stunning it was inside.</p>
      <p>"I think it will be really weird to walk out there in a completely different stage of my life, as an adult. It feels really special for me because Blackpool was a huge part of my childhood."</p>
