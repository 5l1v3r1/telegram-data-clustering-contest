      <h1>In this episode of Pregame Discharge we ask: will Half-Life 3 jokes finally stop with Half-life: Alyx?</h1>
      <h2>Probably not</h2>

      <p>While Lyle continues to calmly scream into the void for answers, here's what's been happening in video games this past week:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>    <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> was announced and it sure looks neat!</li>
        <li>    Rumor has it that <i>Anthem</i> might finally be getting an overhaul!</li>
        <li>    <i>Borderlands 3</i> is getting its first major DLC and much more!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Personally, I'm pretty excited for <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> and what it could potentially bring to VR and the future of video games. Each <i>Half-Life</i> (outside of the episodes and expansions) has fundamentally raised the bar for first-person shooters. I always assumed if there was going to be a new <i>Half-Life</i> -- it would be for VR. I just don't see where else they could go within that genre that already hasn't been done better by now.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../here-s-your-first-look-at-the-new-half-life-alyx-free-for-valve-index-users-573115.phtml">After this week's announcement,</a> though, it seems that's exactly what's going down and I couldn't be more excited and bummed at the same time due to the fact I'm broke and can't afford VR at the moment. However, I'm still stoked I'll at least have something to look forward to when I eventually do!<br/><br/><b>Discharged question of the week:</b> If <i>Half-life: Alyx</i> is any good, do you think it would be a game that could push you over the edge into buying VR?</p>
