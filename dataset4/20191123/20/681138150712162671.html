      <p>The NSPCC mailroom is now taking orders for their 'Letter from Santa' for children in Suffolk and around the UK.</p>
      <p>Since 2001 the children's charity has delivered 84,308 festive messages from Father Christmas across East Anglia, bringing joy to the youngsters who receive the letters.</p>
      <p>In placing their orders over the past 18 years generous family and friends in the region have also donated £502,627 to the NSPCC.</p>
      <p>Lisa Williams from the NSPCC's Individual Giving Team said: "There are few better ways to mark the beginning of the festive period than by ordering a 'Letter from Santa' for a special child in your life and donating to the NSPCC."</p>
      <p>Across the UK and Channel Islands, more than two million letters have been ordered and delivered, with over £12million being raised for the charity's work to stop child abuse.</p>
      <p>This Christmas, family and friends can build children a personalised Letter from Santa, choosing from eight new illustrations, including 'Reindeer Flying Practice', 'Christmas Disco' and 'Elves are Ready to Go!'</p>
      <p>Each letter can be tailored with details including the child's hobbies, best friend or family member's name and a special message.</p>
      <p>Letters are also age appropriate, with shorter text that is easier to read for younger children.</p>
      <p>Chocolate company Lindt is sponsoring the Letter from Santa service for the fifth year running.</p>
      <p>The deadline for ordering letters is November 26 for overseas, December 4 for Europe and 16 December for UK. You can order your letter, for a suggested donation of £5, by <a href="https://letterfromsanta.nspcc.org.uk/letter-from-santa/">visiting the NSPCC's website.</a></p>
