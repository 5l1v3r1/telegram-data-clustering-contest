    <meta property="og:description" content="A simple Facebook post brought Tristan Vaught and Nancy Dawson together. The post asked if gender reveal parties should be reserved for transgender kids when they come out and need new clothes. The question sparked a conversation leading Vaught and Dawson to eventually start a charity that provides clothes to transgender kids and teens at no cost. It's called Transform, and it's in the back room of Dawson's Cincinnati bridal makeup business. Elliot Reed, 17, was the first customer when the space opened this fall. He says his mom read about Transform on Instagram and encouraged him to go. He was nervous but says everybody greeted him with happiness and joy. &quot;It made me feel so accepted and validated,&quot; Reed says."/>
