      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers favourite Joao Moutinho has signed a new contract with the club.</p>
      <p>The majestic midfielder put in his latest star showing in Wolves’ 2-1 victory over Bournemouth today. He started the scoring with a stunning free-kick to notch up his second goal in Wolves colours.</p>
      <p>And Wolves have now announced that Moutinho has signed a new deal which will keep him at Molineux until at least 2022.</p>
