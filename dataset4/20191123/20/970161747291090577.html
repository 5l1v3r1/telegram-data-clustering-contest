        <b>Dynamic TV presenting duo <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebrity-2019-start-date-time-line-hosts-11167643/">Ant and Dec are back on our screens</a> again as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> 2019 continues.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The pair started hosting the show together during the very first season back in in 2002.</p>
      <p>Ant and Dec have been mainstays on British telly for decades, featuring on Byker Grove and Top of the Pops back in the 90s and presenting the likes of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/britains-got-talent/">Britain’s Got Talent</a>, Pop Idol, and Ant &amp; Dec’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/saturday-night-takeaway/">Saturday Night Takeaway</a>.</p>
      <p>With that illustrious pop culture career in mind, here’s a quick look at what Ant and Dec are worth after all that time in the spotlight.</p>
      <h3>Ant and Dec’s net worths</h3>
      <p>Ant and Dec have made a pretty penny with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/2190667/ant-dec-net-worth-saturday-night-takeaway-bgt-ntas/">The Sun</a> reporting earlier this year that they are each worth approximately £62 million.</p>

      <p>The two first started working together after they met on the set of CBBC drama Byker Grove, in which they both starred.</p>

      <p>After their time on the show, they branched out into music and performed first as duo PJ &amp; Duncan – their character’s names from Byker Grove – then as Ant &amp; Dec for their third and final studio album.</p>
      <p>In 1994, while they were still performing as PJ &amp; Duncan, they presented their first series, which was a children’s show called Gimme 5, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>

      <p>Ant and Dec have hosted I’m A Celebrity together every season except one, with Ant taking time away from TV last year.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Holly Willoughby joined Dec in the jungle, as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/19/why-is-ant-mcpartlin-not-presenting-im-a-celebrity-this-year-8154870/">Ant took time away from the spotlight</a> the deal with personal issues and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/22/what-tv-shows-did-ant-mcpartlin-work-on-in-2018-to-qualify-for-a-national-television-award-8375290/">spend time in rehab</a> after he faced drink-driving charges that spring.</p>
      <p>At the time, he released a statement saying: ‘My recovery is going very well and for that to continue having spoken to Dec and ITV, I have made the decision to take the rest of the year off.</p>
      <p>‘I’d like to thank both Dec and ITV for their continued support and I look forward to getting back to work in the new year.’</p>
