      <h1>Judge dismisses Subway's $158M lawsuit against CBC over report exposing its chicken</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:10:44+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:10</time> by <a rel="author">Gerren Keith Gaynor</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/canada">Canadian </a>judge has dismissed a CA$210 million ($158 million) defamation lawsuit filed by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink">Subway </a>against the CBC, which had reported the sandwich chain may have been selling some poultry products that were only 50 percent chicken DNA.</p>
      <p>Justice E.M. Morgan of the Ontario Superior Court ruled on Friday that the CBC investigation met the “public interest test” and is protected under the so-called anti-SLAPP.</p>
      <p>The legal code provision allows a defendant to ask the court to dismiss a lawsuit if they can show it was to shield the plaintiff from criticism and prevent free speech on a matter of public interest, the CBC reported.</p>
      <p>"The Marketplace report raised a quintessential consumer protection issue. There are few things in society of more acute interest to the public than what they eat," Morgan wrote in his ruling.</p>

      <p>"I consider that CBC has satisfied its burden."</p>
      <p>Subway launched the lawsuit in April 2017, claiming that the CBC report caused significant sales losses.</p>
      <p>The investigative report at the center of the lawsuit involved the news organization sending samples of chicken from five major fast-food restaurants to a lab for DNA analysis. The results suggested that some of Subway’s chicken products may contain slightly more or slightly less than half chicken DNA.</p>
      <p>Subway disputed the report after it aired in February 2017.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The private food chain later filed a defamation lawsuit that accused the CBC of acting “recklessly and maliciously” in airing the report. The tests conducted on the chicken, the company said, “lacked scientific rigor.”</p>
      <p>CBC stood by the story in a statement defending the report and pointed out that it gave Subway the chance to refute the findings before it aired and appeared online.</p>

      <p>"CBC News has and continues to maintain that our journalism was fair, accurate and within the public interest," CBC news general manager and editor-in-chief Jennifer McGuire said in response to Friday’s ruling.</p>
      <p>"Needless to say, we are happy with this decision."   </p>
