      <h1>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #100 Cover Homages Every Issue to Date</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:11:09+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:11</time> by <a rel="author">Chad Denton</a></address>
      <p>Hailing "100 issues of turtle power," IDW Publishing released the cover for the 100th issue of the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> comic with a collage of all previous 99 issues of the series. The collage goes back to issue #1 of the IDW series, which began in August 2011.</p>
      <p>Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird first self-published <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> in 1984 under the Mirage Comics banner. Since the series began, <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles </i>has been canceled and revived several times and passed through a couple of companies, including <a href="https://screenrant.com/undiscovered-country-image-comics/">Image Comics</a>. The IDW series rebooted the continuity from the previous series.</p>

      <p>The 48-page issue #100 will feature the climax of the "City at War" story arc which started in #93 and sees the Turtles pitted against rival agendas, including long-time enemies Karai and Bishop along with sometimes ally/sometimes foe <a href="https://www.cbr.com/ciaramella-guides-tmnts-old-hob-on-a-new-path/">Old Hob</a>. <a href="https://www.idwpublishing.com/product/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-100/">IDW's solicitation</a> reads, "Things have never been worse for the TMNT and their allies, but there’s still one desperate gambit to try if the family can come together in time. Will it be worth the cost?"</p>
      <p><i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles </i>#100 is written by Kevin Eastman and Tom Waltz with art by Mateus Santolouco and David Wachter. Originally solicited for November, the issue will drop December 11.</p>
