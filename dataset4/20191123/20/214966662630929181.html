      <p>A woman has been charged with murder after her two young daughters died in a hot car in Logan.</p>
      <p>The two sisters, aged one and two were discovered unconscious in the car at Waterford West around 1.30pm on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>It’s reported the girls’ mother tried to cool them down in a bath while paramedics rushed to the home.</p>
      <p>But the girls could not be revived and they were pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>It’s claimed the pair could have been in the car for as long as seven hours.</p>
      <p>“The two children exhibited evidence of being exposed to extreme heat,” Detective Inspector Mark White told reporters.</p>
      <p>“It’s just a very, very tragic incident that has occurred. They were very young children.”</p>
      <p>Temperatures in the Logan area were around 30 degrees on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Experts say the temps inside the car would have been double that.</p>
      <p>The girls’ 27-year-old mother has now been charged with two counts of murder.</p>
      <p>She is due to appear in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday.</p>
      <p>Counselling is being offered to emergency service personnel who were first on the scene.</p>
      <p>“It can be quite a distressing scene to be confronted by. We are putting a lot of emphasis on supporting our people,” Det. Inspector White said.</p>
