        <b>Caitlyn Jenner’s time on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> got off to an emotional start, with the 70-year-old <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/caitlyn-jenners-girlfriend-sophia-hutchins-wants-call-im-celebrity-producers-gut-wrenching-breakdown-difficult-deal-11186724/">in tears after one night in the jungle</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since then however, she’s thrown herself into her camp experience, as she’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/kim-kardashian-finally-breaks-silence-caitlyn-jenners-im-celebrity-stint-11204997/">given her fellow campmates a rousing motivational speech</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/im-a-celebrity-recap-caitlyn-jenner-learns-girls-aloud-dance-as-she-apologises-for-insulting-soap-stars-11196763/">bonded with the other women in the jungle</a> the classic way – through dance, with Girls Aloud alum Nadine Coyle teaching them the moves to The Promise.</p>
      <p>She’s also been seen opening up to the other celebs about her family life, saying that she’ll soon have a whopping total of 20 grandchildren.</p>
      <h3>Who are Caitlyn Jenner’s grandchildren?</h3>
      <p>Caitlyn’s stepdaughter <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/10/many-kids-kardashian-family-kims-surrogate-goes-labour-9485828/">Kim Kardashian has four children</a> called North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm</p>
      <p>Kourtney Kardashian has three children called Mason, Penelope and Reign, and her sister Khloe Kardashian has daughter True.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn’s biological son Bert Jenner – who she had with ex-wife Chrystie Crownover – has two children called William Behr and Bodi, and Burt’s sister Casey Jenner has three – Francesca, Isabella and Luke.</p>
      <p>Brandon Jenner, who’s the brother of Brody and was born during Caitlyn’s second marriage to Linda Thompson, has one child and twins due early next year with Casey Stoker.</p>

      <p>That adds up to a whopping a total of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/im-celebrity-fans-convinced-caitlyn-jenner-let-slip-kylie-pregnant-11203905/">16 grandkids with two on the way</a> in 2020.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn however, when asked about how many grandchildren she has, told her fellow jungle-dwellers: ‘Coming up this December I will have 20, and they call me Boom Boom’.</p>
      <p>This has sparked speculation that one of her daughters, namely Kylie Jenner, could be pregnant again, with many fans taking to social media to voice their theories.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn had her children when she was still known publically as Bruce Jenner.</p>
      <p>She said in the jungle: ‘My kids all call me dad, Kendall asked me first and I said “dad”, I’m your dad and I’ll always be your dad ’til the day I die.</p>
      <p>‘But what they’re really good at which shocks me all the time is when they’re talking about me, “my dad, she” and it’s tough to change the pronoun in the middle of it.’</p>
      <p>When Kate Garraway asked if Caitlyn felt like their father, she continued: ‘Bruce raised them and Caitlyn is enjoying their life with them.’</p>
      <p>Oh, our hearts!</p>
