      <p>Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta</p>
      <p>The Olu of Ilaro and Paramount ruler of Yewaland, Oba Kehinde Olugbenle, has urged the governorship candidate of the Allied People’s Movement in Ogun State,  Adekunle Akinlade, to withdraw his case at the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>The monarch also asked Akinlade to settle with the state governor, Dapo Abiodun, and join hands with him for the progress of the state.</p>
      <p>The monarch stated this on Saturday at the grand finale of the 2019 Oronna Ilaro Festival Day held at the Asade Agunloye Pavilion, empire field, Ilaro, Ogun State.</p>
      <p>The monarch said, ”To my brother hon. Akinlade who contested in the last election with His  Excellency, Prince Dapo Abiodun,  I want to say with  all sense of responsibility that you are a pride of this land.</p>
      <p>“And I want to beg and implore you on behalf of the good people of Yewaland, whom you represent that we don’t need any appeal at the Supreme Court. Go and withdraw your case at the Supreme court.”</p>
      <p>He, therefore, advised him to join hands with Dapo Abiodun so as to move the state forward.</p>
      <p>He, however, warned politicians to steer clear of the festival.</p>
