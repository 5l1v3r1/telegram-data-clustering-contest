        <b>The National Basketball Association (NBA) league in the United States may be closer to a shorter season, a new postseason format and the in-season tournament Commissioner Adam Silver has long wanted as well.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The NBA is working with the players’ union and all 30 teams on a plan to shorten the regular season, possibly to 78 games, a person familiar with the negotiations disclosed on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The league is also considering a change to the playoff seeding and the addition of a mid-year tournament for all 30 clubs in time for the 2021-22 season.</p>
      <p>The tournament would likely be a way for teams to make up for the loss of revenue from the shorter regular season and fewer home games.</p>
      <p>The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no update on the plan has been made public by the league.</p>
      <p>ESPN first reported the progression of the plan on today.</p>
      <p>The proposal could be sent to the league’s board of governors in April for discussion and possibly ratification.</p>
      <p>NBA broadcast partners ESPN and Turner Sports also are involved in the talks.</p>
      <p>ESPN reported, too, that the proposal includes a plan to re-seed the playoffs after early rounds, potentially creating an NBA Finals between teams from the same conference.</p>
      <p>The notion of adding a mid-season tournament has been something Silver has batted around since at least 2016, drawing the parallel to how such events are customary in European football.</p>
      <p>“It would need to be negotiated with the Players Association,” he said this year.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had very general discussions with (union executive director) Michele Roberts about the notion that these are the kinds of things we’re looking at. I think she, of course, is supportive of looking at any ideas we have to build the business over time.”</p>
      <p>The same applies to having a play-in playoff round, which Silver has said he supports.</p>
      <p>That idea has even reached the proposal stage, reviewed by the league’s competition committee and others.</p>
      <p>The possibility of changing the playoff seeding has been talked about for some time as well.</p>
      <p>But the drawback to any shortening of the schedule — and perhaps fewer home games — is a decrease in revenue, which everyone would want to avoid.</p>
