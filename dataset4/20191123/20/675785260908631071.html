      <p>Tearful Karim Zeroual ran over to his crying mum and sister tonight after his emotional <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> routine.</p>
      <p>The CBBC star paid tribute to his family during his contemporary couples' choice dance - which had Strictly viewers 'in pieces'.</p>
      <p>Before he took to the dance floor, Karim said: "It's about not having many people in your life but the few you do have can make you. Your dreams can come true and anything is possible."</p>
      <p>After Karim and professional partner Amy Dowden's touching performance - the CBBC presenter rushed over to hug his tearful mum Carol.</p>
      <p>Wiping away tears, Karim said: "My mum and sister are everything. Two strong women in my life. Amy represented that in the dance holding me up."</p>

      <p>Craig Revel Horwood praised Karim for his "dynamic and engaging" performance - but admitted it was not enough for a 10.</p>
      <p>He said: "I thought it had great leaps and turns but I have to say I think that you're a technician and not an actor and that bothers me. There could have been a lot more story. I think it's lacking emotional conent.</p>
      <p>"I want you to fly. I'm desperate to get a 10 out for you but I'm battling with the fact your technique is overpowering what you're trying to say."</p>

      <p>Bruno hit back at Craig and claimed he loved the "freedom of flowing movement".</p>
      <p>Motsi Mabuse said: "As a dancer I'm just amazed at what you bring to the show. Your technique is unbelievable. Those spins in the air and jumps. I love you always give 110%. To watch you is like a gift."</p>
      <p>Shirley Ballas added: "Family is everything and mums are the best."</p>

      <p>Strictly Come Dancing viewers took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> after watching the emotional moment.</p>
      <p>One fan said: "God I LOVE how Karim isn’t afraid to show emotion and I LOVE also the obvious love and respect he has for his mum and sister. An absolutely beautiful man."</p>
      <p>"Karim’s backstory already had me in complete pieces &amp; then he went danced stunningly &amp; then he hugged his crying mum &amp; sister. I can’t cope," added another.</p>
      <p>A third said: "I was raised by a single mum, I myself am a single mum. Mums ARE the best and children who do you proud are a blessing. You go, Karim! Show the world that girl power of your mum and sister!"</p>
      <p>"Normally hate the filler fluff between the dances but #Karim ‘s story nearly made me cry. And then I was in floods when he went to his mum afterwards," agreed a fourth.</p>
