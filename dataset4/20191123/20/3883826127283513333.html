        <b>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola fears the injury Sergio Aguero suffered in their <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50443048">2-1 win over Chelsea</a> is a "bad" muscle problem.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Argentina striker Aguero, 31, hobbled off after 77 minutes and was replaced by Brazil forward Gabriel Jesus.</p>
      <p>"Sergio will be bad, I think. Tomorrow we will know it. The feeling is it's muscular," said Guardiola.</p>
      <p>Midfielders Rodri and David Silva were also substituted but the City boss said that was just "cramps and tiredness".</p>
      <p>N'Golo Kante gave Chelsea the lead at Etihad Stadium, but Kevin de Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez replied as City moved above the visitors into third place in the table.</p>
      <p>An extended period without Aguero - who missed five games last season with a groin problem - would be a worry for City given he has scored 13 goals in 16 games this season.</p>
