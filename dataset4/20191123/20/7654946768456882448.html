      <h1>Embattled surgeon Dr. David Samadi has a new gig on Long Island</h1>

      <p>The New York City surgeon at the center of a Medicare fraud scandal for double-booking operations is still operating, this time at a hospital in Long Island.</p>
      <p>Dr. David Samadi, a prostate cancer specialist and one of the top-earning doctors in the city, is billed as a men’s health specialist at St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn. He left Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan in June, where he had been paid $2 million a year with an annual bonus of up to $5 million.</p>
      <p>Lenox Hill and parent company Northwell Health agreed earlier this month to pay $12.3 million to settle federal claims that it <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/08/lenox-hill-hospital-will-shell-out-12-3m-for-submitting-fraudulent-claims-to-medicare/">fraudulently billed Medicare </a>for Samadi’s overlapping surgeries and unnecessary procedures.</p>
      <p>A federal whistleblower suit claimed that Samadi’s salary was so high that Lenox Hill needed to squeeze the most revenue out of him by allowing unsupervised residents to perform procedures — operations patients thought were done by Samadi —while he operated at the same time on someone else.</p>
      <p>The suit also claimed Samadi unnecessarily did minor procedures in the operating room and the hospital billed Medicare for those services.</p>
      <p>“I think we exposed these medical practices that are not just violations of Medicare laws, they violate patient rights,” said Joseph Lanni, the lawyer representing the whistleblowers. “It puts patient safety at risk.”</p>
      <p>Samadi now faces a similar federal Medicare fraud claim brought by the same two whistleblowers, one a former patient and the other representing his late father who was a patient.  He is also named in eight malpractice suits in state court.</p>
      <p>Samadi’s lawyer said the surgeon “routinely exercised and continues to exercise his professional judgment to ensure the excellent outcomes he has been able to achieve for his patients.”</p>
      <p>St. Francis called Samadi “a talented physician who is recognized in the field of urology and men’s health.”</p>
