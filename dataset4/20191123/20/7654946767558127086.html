      <p>A self-proclaimed Chinese spy who turned himself over to Australian authorities has confessed to kidnapping a Hong Kong dissident bookseller and meddling in Taiwan’s 2018 elections.</p>
      <p>Wang “William” Liqiang, a Chinese defector living in Sydney, may be the first Chinese undercover agent to defect to the West, the Associated Press reported.</p>
      <p>Liqiang claims to have worked for a Hong Kong investment firm that was actually a Chinese government front to conduct political and economic espionage.</p>
      <p>“These are very disturbing reports,” Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told reporters Saturday. “The matter is now in the hands of the appropriate law enforcement agencies.”</p>
      <p>The former head of Australia’s counterespionage agency, Duncan Lewis, said Friday that China is attempting a “takeover” of the Australian government — a worry that Prime Minister Scott Morrison dismissed.</p>
