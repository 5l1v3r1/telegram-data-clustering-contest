      <p>Peel police have charged an alleged impaired driver who was stopped at a ride spot check in Mississauga on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>Officers arrested the driver in the area of Dixie Road and North Service Road around 1 a.m.</p>
      <p>Following his arrest, a loaded firearm was located, police said.</p>
      <p>A 27-year-old man who is from Toronto has been charged with impaired operation of a vehicle with a blood alcohol content over 80 mgs, unauthorized possession of a firearm, possession of a loaded firearm, knowledge of unauthorized possession of a firearm, careless storage of a firearm, and possession of a weapon for dangerous purpose.</p>
      <p>He was scheduled to appear at a Brampton court on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Ontario Provincial Police Sgt. Kerry Schmidt said that four people were arrested in Toronto on Friday for impaired driving.</p>
      <p>“One of those drivers was also stopped because he was going the wrong way in a construction zone and actually struck three construction workers on Highway 401 in the City of Toronto,” Schmidt said.</p>
      <p>“This is certainly a huge concern for us and the fact is we continue to find alcohol and drug impaired drivers operating their vehicles putting themselves at risk and putting everybody at risk.”</p>
      <p>Schmidt warned drivers that if they are attending a celebration this holiday season, “you have to have a plan.”</p>
