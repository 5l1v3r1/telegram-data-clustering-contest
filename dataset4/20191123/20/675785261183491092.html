      <p>The Post Office has been accused of behaving like a ­Victorian factory boss in a row over treatment of staff.</p>
      <p>More than 500 subpostmasters are suing the firm claiming they were wrongly accused of theft, fraud and false accounting.</p>
      <p>Many were sacked, stripped of their savings and even jailed, despite claims a faulty computer was to blame for the errors.</p>
      <p>The Post Office appealed against a court ruling that staff contracts were unfair.</p>
      <p>But Appeal Court judge Lord Justice Coulson blocked that bid and told bosses they treated workers in ­“capricious or arbitrary ways which would not be unfamiliar to a mid-Victorian factory-owner”.</p>
      <p>The Post Office – which has spent £19million of public cash on the case – disputes the claims, insisting there is no evidence of a systemic computer problem.</p>
      <p>It said: “We are looking at the Appeal Court’s decision in detail.”</p>
