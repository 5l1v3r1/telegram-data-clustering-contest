      <p><b>MONTREAL — </b>The prospect of Russia being banned from next year's Olympics is looming closer after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) panel recommended on Friday that the country's drug-testing authority be declared non-compliant with international rules.</p>
      <p>In a statement, WADA said its Compliance Review Committee (CRC) had recommended that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) be suspended again when the global anti-doping watchdog's Executive Committee meets in Paris on Dec 9.</p>
      <p>If WADA chiefs adopt the recommendation, Russia faces severe sanctions including a possible ban from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.</p>
      <p>The CRC issued its recommendation after asking Russia to explain "inconsistencies" in laboratory data handed over by Moscow to WADA investigators in January.</p>
      <p>Full disclosure of data from the Moscow laboratory was a key condition of Russia's controversial reinstatement by WADA in September 2018.</p>
      <p>RUSADA had been suspended for nearly three years over revelations of a vast, state-backed doping regime which including a systematic conspiracy to switch tainted samples at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.</p>
      <p>WADA had previously warned Russia would face the "most stringent sanctions" if any of the data handed over was found to have been tampered with.</p>
      <p>In its statement on Friday, WADA said the CRC suggested "serious consequences in line with the International Standard for Code Compliance by Signatories."</p>
      <p>The United States Anti-Doping Agency, which was sharply critical of WADA's decision to lift its suspension of reinstate RUSADA, called for a lengthy ban following Friday's announcement.</p>
      <p>"Anything less than a four-year sanction for this critical violation that includes aggravating circumstances following years of denial and deceit would be another injustice in a long line of many for clean athletes," USADA chief executive Travis Tygart said in emailed comments to AFP.</p>
      <p>Friday's development is the latest twist to a saga which exploded in 2015, when an independent WADA commission investigating allegations of Russian doping said it had found evidence of a vast state-supported conspiracy stretching back years.</p>
      <p>A 2016 report by WADA investigator Richard McLaren said more than 1,000 Russian competitors across multiple sports had benefited from the scheme between 2011 and 2015.</p>
      <p>In an interview with AFP last month, RUSADA's chief Yuri Ganus appeared resigned to Russia being handed an Olympic ban, accusing unidentified Moscow authorities of handing over falsified lab data to WADA.</p>
      <p>"Russia's Olympic squad will be prevented from participating fully in the Olympic Games in Tokyo.... I think that this will also happen at the (Winter Olympic) Games in China," Ganus told AFP.</p>
      <p>Russia was already banned from the 2018 Winter Olympics, although some 168 athletes were allowed to compete under a neutral "Olympic Athlete From Russia" designation.</p>
      <p>Ganus said he expected a range of other penalties too, including restrictions on holding international tournaments in Russia, exclusion of Russians from international sports federations and fines.</p>
      <p>Ganus insisted RUSADA officials had not been responsible for falsifying the data, insisting his staff "had nothing to do with the database and its transfer."</p>
      <p>Russian Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov later denied the data had been tampered with, stating "nothing was removed" before the cache of information was handed over.</p>
      <p>"There was not any manipulation as the head of Russia's anti-doping laboratory, Yuri Ganus, says. That's our position," Kolobkov said.</p>
      <p>Friday's announcement by WADA came as World Athletics (formerly IAAF), the governing body for track and field, abruptly halted Russia's reinstatement process into the sport.</p>
      <p>The World Athletics decision was taken after the president of the Russian athletics federation (RUSAF), Dmitry Shlyakhtin, and other senior officials were suspended for "serious breaches" of anti-doping rules.</p>
