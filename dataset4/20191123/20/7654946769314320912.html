      <h1>Stephanie Parze’s dad makes heartbreaking pledge to missing daughter: ‘Daddy is trying everything’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:38:03+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:38</time> by <a rel="author">Georgett Roberts and Sara Dorn</a></address>
      <p>The distraught dad of a missing New Jersey woman whose <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/john-ozbilgen-ex-boyfriend-of-missing-nj-woman-stephanie-parze-found-dead/">ex-boyfriend killed himself</a> after being named a person of interest in the case made a heartbreaking pledge to his vanished daughter Saturday.</p>
      <p>“Stephanie, Daddy is trying everything he can. We are not going to stop till we find you,” <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/family-of-missing-nj-nanny-stephanie-parze-will-keep-searching/">Edward Parze told The Post</a> from the Freehold firehouse, where hundreds of volunteers gathered Saturday morning to look for the 25-year-old.</p>
      <p>“Just keep fighting. You know that we are all out there looking for you. We are not stopping. We will keep turning over rock and stone ’til we find you.”</p>
      <p>Stephanie Parze’s ex, John Ozbilgen, was found dead from an apparent suicide in his parents’ home Friday, authorities said. Ozbilgen was once arrested for assaulting Stephanie.</p>
      <p>The devastated dad was empathetic toward Ozbilgen’s family.</p>
      <p>“Loss of life is a tragedy, so we feel for them,” Parze said.</p>
      <p>About 200 volunteers — many clad in white T-shirts with Stephanie Parze’s face on them — searched a wooded area near the station Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, another search was underway in Tottenville on Staten Island, where authorities say cellphone records led them.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/04/new-jersey-woman-stephanie-parze-goes-missing-after-visit-to-psychic/">Stephanie Parze disappeared</a> after an Oct. 31 night out with friends and family to visit a psychic in New Brunswick, New Jersey.</p>
      <p>Ozbilgen — a former Staten Islander who was arrested for allegedly assaulting Parze in September — sent her menacing text messages the night she disappeared, police said.</p>
      <p>Ozbilgen, 29, was found dead of a suicide-by-hanging in his parents Freehold home on Friday, police said.</p>
      <p>Edward Parze only met Ozbilgen once or twice, he said Saturday.</p>
      <p>“It was like a five-minute hi, bye,” he said. “I would imagine she was just dating him on and off. It was nothing serious or I would have known something about that.”</p>
      <p>Authorities have refused to say if Ozbilgen left a suicide note.</p>
      <p>“They [law enforcement] are not telling us much of anything,” Parze said.</p>
