      <p>Connor Degenhardt's 46-yard pass to Ayir Asante set up Cozier's 15-yard TD run in the second quarter. Dobbs intercepted a Gunther Johnson pass on the next series and raced untouched down the sideline for a 14-0 lead.</p>
      <p>Derek Ng kicked a 21-yard field goal and Cozier scored on a 20-yard run in the fourth quarter after the Hoyas missed a field goal.</p>
