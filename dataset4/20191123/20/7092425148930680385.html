        <b>Manchester City and Chelsea played out an entertaining clash at the Etihad Stadium tonight.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chelsea went on the attack from the off and the were rewarded in the 21st minute as N'Golo Kante's effort bobbled over the line.</p>
      <p>To Pep Guardiola's credit, his side did not panic after going 1-0 down.</p>
      <p>They kept their composure and ha an equaliser seven minutes later.</p>
      <p>Kevin De Bruyne didn't need a second invitation to shoot when he picked up the ball on the edge of the box and it flew in after taking a fortunate deflection off Kurt Zouma.</p>
      <p>In the 36th minute they had the lead after a piece of individual brilliant from Riyad Mahrez.</p>
      <p>The Algerian winger went on a run before cutting inside and firing the ball past Kepa.</p>
      <p>The second-half wasn't as lively, unsurprisingly given the frantic pace of the opening 45 minutes.</p>
      <p>There were four minutes of additional time at the end, plenty of time for some late drama.</p>
      <p>Mason Mount went close with a free-kick before City went down the field and scored moments later.</p>
      <p>However, VAR ruled out Raheem Sterling's goal for offside.</p>
      <p>The result saw City leapfrog Chelsea into third place.</p>
