      <p>A football game between Yale and Harvard was delayed for nearly an hour Saturday when <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/climate-change">climate-change</a> protesters occupied the field.</p>
      <p>The Ivy League showdown in New Haven, Connecticut stood at 15 – 3 to Harvard when activists took over the field with large banners, including one that read “Nobody wins: Yale &amp; Harvard are complicit in climate injustice.”</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/23/us/harvard-yale-game-protest.html?smtyp=cur&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimes">The New York Times</a>, the students were calling attention to their respective universities to divest their investments in fossil fuels.</p>

      <p>According to live ESPN commentary, protesters arrived from different sides of the Yale bowl and sat in the middle of the field just before the second half began. As players from both teams retreated to their respective locker rooms, the crowd of protesters got bigger.</p>
      <p>Campus police from Yale University and members of the New Haven police department were seen removing protesters.</p>
      <p>The game resumed after a <a href="https://www.ithacajournal.com/story/sports/2019/11/23/see-harvard-yale-football-delayed-by-student-protest-photos-video/4283754002/">48-minute delay</a>.</p>
      <p>The Times reported that there was a mixed reaction in the crowd, with some attendees booing and shouting that authorities drag the protesters off the field.</p>
      <p>The matchup between both institutions has become one of college football’s most storied rivalries. Harvard won last year’s showdown 45-27.</p>
