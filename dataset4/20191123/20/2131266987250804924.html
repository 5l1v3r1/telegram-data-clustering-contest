      <p>Dozens of protesters have stormed an oil vessel in Timaru, hoping to stop its owner "drilling for new oil in the middle of a climate emergency".</p>
      <p>Greenpeace says the Bahamas-flagged Skandi Atlantic was preparing to leave the Port of Timaru and travel north to Taranaki, where a 34,000-tonne oil rig commissioned by OMV is set to "undertake the riskiest kind of oil drilling, at extreme depths".</p>
      <p>"By occupying OMV's henchboat, we're delaying the monster rig from drilling for new oil in the middle of a climate emergency," said Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner Amanda Larsson.</p>
      <p>She said the rig's location - 50 nautical miles off the coast of Taranaki - "means it’s nearly impossible for ordinary New Zealanders to take peaceful action to confront it directly".</p>
      <p>"We've brought the resistance here to disrupt its chain of support. We won't let this rig carry out its climate-destroying activities quietly, out of sight and mind."</p>

      <p>Accompanying Greenpeace are members of Extinction Rebellion, Oil Free Otago, and 350 Aotearoa.</p>
      <p>Larsson says they have no plans to leave in a hurry:</p>
      <p>"They've set up tents on the deck, they've set up some banners. They're ready to get comfy and stay here for a while."</p>
      <p>Police are at the scene, telling Newshub they're there to uphold the law and ensure safety, while recognising the legal right for protest.</p>
      <p>"Police will respond appropriately to any issues that arise," a spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>The Government has banned future oil exploration in much of the country, with some exceptions in Taranaki. Existing permits will also be allowed to be carried out. </p>
      <p>OMV was named in a <a href="https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf?1499691240">recent report</a> as one of the world's top 100 carbo-emitting companies, responsible for 70 percent of the world's emissions between them.</p>
      <p>OMV is about to begin drilling three oil wells in Taranaki, and another off the Otago coast.</p>
