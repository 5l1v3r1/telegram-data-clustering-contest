      <h1>Freed killer in secret body controversy must reveal any romantic relationship he has after his release</h1>
      <h2>Ian Simms is to become a free man after last week's Parole Board bombshell decision to end his 31 years behind bars following Helen McCourt murder</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:23:31+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/luke-traynor/" target="_blank">Luke Traynor</a></address>
      <p>A pub landlord who killed Helen McCourt 31 years ago - but has never disclosed where her body is - must reveal any romantic relationship he has now he's been freed.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, mum Marie McCourt was informed the bombshell news that <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/mums-heartache-being-told-daughters-17294434">murderer Ian Simms had been approved for release</a> by the Parole Board, despite his 22-year-old victim's remains still being kept a secret.</p>
      <p>It has now emerged the St Helens parent has <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/no-body-no-parole-mccourt-17082528">launched an online campaign to raise funds for a judicial review</a> to challenge the controversial decision.</p>
      <p>And the ECHO has learnt Simms, now 63 after <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/caged-killer-never-released-after-16539466">three decades behind bars,</a> has to disclose details of any relationship with a woman to his probation officer.</p>
      <p>Also part of a series of conditions, the killer <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/woodland-near-clay-pits-being-16991047">cannot make contact with the McCourt family,</a> must observe a curfew and a tag device to monitor his whereabouts, and is not allowed to enter an exclusion zone drawn up by Helen's devastated family.</p>
      <p>That includes large parts of Merseyside, Manchester, Lancashire, and Cheshire, including districts in Warrington, like Rixton clay pits, 15 miles from Helen's home in Billinge, where it suspected she may be hidden.</p>

      <p>Mrs McCourt, who described Simms' newfound freedom as "shocking", is now demanding a meeting with Justice Secretary Robert Buckland to see if she has any avenues to appeal Simms' release.</p>
      <p>On a recently-launched Go Fund Me web page, the 76-year-old mum wrote: "My legal team is now studying the Parole Board’s decision and considering what avenues are open to me to stop the release.</p>
      <p>"One such option is to launch a judicial review of the decision in the High Court.</p>
      <p>"I am taking a stand not just for me but for all other families in this horrendous situation.</p>
      <p>"Taking this action could be expensive - and we need your help.</p>
      <p>"Over half a million of us stood together to fight for Helen's law -  now I’m asking you to support our legal action by donating to our fighting fund.</p>

      <p>"All money raised during this funding campaign will go towards legal costs I may incur.</p>
      <p>"Any unused money will be placed into a fund to support future legal action by other families of the 'missing murdered'."</p>
      <p>Nearly £19,000 has been raised in the last 48 hours.</p>
      <p>Mrs McCourt told the ECHO: "If one of the conditions is he must inform any romantic relationship he has, then that means they believe he is still a danger to women.</p>
      <p>"I feel its a bit of a joke the reasons the Parole Board gave for releasing him."</p>
      <p>The mum added that Helen's Law - a new piece of legislation to make it more difficult for murderers to gain release if they don't reveal where they buried a body - still stands a good chance of getting on the statute books next Spring, despite the recent release of Simms.</p>
      <p>It was included in the Queens Speech in October, but since December's General Election was announced, its progress was put on hold and looks uncertain until a new government is decided.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/parole-board-explain-reasons-freed-17294424">In its statement,</a> the Parole Board said that although Simms refused to reveal where his victim's body was, he had made "progress" and met the test for release.</p>
      <p>Simms was convicted after he was found with blood on his clothes which matched that of Helen’s parents, and her opal and sapphire earring was found in his car.</p>
      <p>His bloodstained clothes were recovered from banks of a river, and a knotted strangling flex discovered nearby had teeth marks in it, matching those of the landlord’s dog and hairs identical to Helen’s caught in it.</p>
      <p>It was one of the first UK cases to be solved using DNA.</p>
      <p>Simms has always denied knowing where he dumped the insurance clerk's body.</p>
