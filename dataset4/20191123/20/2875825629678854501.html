      <h2>Jose Mourinho explained why he didn't walk over to the travelling Tottenham supporters to clap them after his first game in charge of the north London club against West Ham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:10:11+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:10</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has apologised to the Tottenham fans for not walking over to clap the travelling supporters after Spurs' 3-2 win over <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham.</a></p>
      <p>Mourinho masterminded victory over the Hammers in his first match in charge following Mauricio Pochettino's sacking after five years at the helm last Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Spurs stormed into a three-goal lead with Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane all on target.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> battled back fifteen minutes before the end and significantly reduced the deficit, with Michail Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna getting on the scoresheet.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> players clapped the away fans following the match at the London Stadium.</p>

      <p>Mourinho, on the other hand, opted to head down the tunnel instead, but apologised for doing so when later talking to the press.</p>
      <p>"At the end of the game I didn't want to go to our fans as I felt I shouldn't, it's about the players, not about me, so apologies for that," said the Portuguese on Spurs TV.</p>
      <p>"A few thousand were there and right behind the team, enjoying, understanding and supporting - now they are as happy as we are."</p>
      <p>Mourinho was delighted to get the three points in his first match in charge, and outlined how important it is to hit the ground running.</p>
      <p>He added: "It was very very important. 11 months without music in the away dressing room, without a smile or happiness. They did it.</p>

      <p>"I am very happy for them and with them. If someone only saw the result they'd have thought it was very difficult for us.</p>
      <p>"But it was probably closer to a 4-0 than 3-1. I think my players paid the price of a very difficult week. International break, change of manager, new guy, different training sessions."</p>
