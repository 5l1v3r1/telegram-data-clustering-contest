      <h1>Every word Frank Lampard said on Man City loss, praise from Guardiola and Chelsea's next step</h1>
      <h2>The Blues were beaten 2-1 to move to fourth in the Premier League</h2>

        <b>Had more possession than Guardiola's side and praised by him. Take heart from the performance?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Maybe it is not the critical factor, but coming into the game in our recent form and developing quickly, I wanted us to come here and be brave. Be brave on the ball and off it and I think that you saw that from us today.</p>
      <p>"At 1-0 we had a relative control of the game. Of course when you are here it can never last. They had a couple of moments, but we were playing well and throughout the game there were a lot of positives.</p>
      <p>"At this level maybe it shows that the finer details in the boxes, both boxes decide these ones."</p>
      <p>
        <b>How do you take that next step against the bigger teams from performances into results?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Everyone seems slightly fixated on those couple of games we’ve played, like Liverpool and City. We have gone toe to toe with them, drawing in Istanbul and then losing on penalties.</p>
      <p>"Lost at home in the league pushing for 45 minutes. We have lost today with a very good performance, it is moments in the boxes. That is not something you can actually put down as a rule going into a game of why you win it or don’t.</p>
      <p>"These teams like Liverpool and City have been getting results for a long time, they have worked together and worked hard, they get things right.</p>
      <p>"Today I don’t think you can come away from that game and think anything other than it was two really strong teams going against each other. One wins it because of a deflected goal and one moment of real quality from Mahrez and the rest was pretty much in the balance."</p>
