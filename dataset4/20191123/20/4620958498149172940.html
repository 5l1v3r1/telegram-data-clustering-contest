      <p>The perceptions of Canadians on animal welfare issues have gone through noticeable changes over the past two decades.</p>
      <p>In Vancouver, we experienced months – if not years – of discussions related to keeping cetaceans in captivity. Across Canada, more than 25 municipal governments forbid circuses from using “performing animals.”</p>
      <p>Even our relationship with beef has shifted moderately. Earlier this summer, Research Co. found that <a href="https://biv.com/article/2019/08/poll-canadian-food-tastes-packed-regional-flavour">60% of Canadians</a> would eat a plant-based hamburger patty, with younger adults being more likely to indulge than their older counterparts.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, we looked at the way Canadians feel about specific issues related to human interaction with animals, including food, fashion and entertainment.</p>
      <p>Eating animals is seen unfavourably by 19% of Canadians, with three in four (75%) having no qualms about it. As expected, there are some subtle generational differences. Fewer than one in five Canadians aged 55 and over (16%) and aged 35 to 54 (17%) deride eating animals, compared to 25% of those aged 18 to 34.</p>
      <p>At the other extreme of the public-approval scale is trophy hunting, which is seen favourably by only 10% of Canadians – including 15% of men, 16% of residents of Manitoba and Saskatchewan and 14% of Conservative Party voters in the 2019 federal election. An overwhelming majority of Canadians (85%) voices opposition to trophy hunting, including 73% who are “strongly” against it.</p>
      <p>Hunting animals for meat, however, is viewed differently, with practically two-thirds (65%) saying they favour this practice and about three in 10 (29%) saying they oppose it.</p>
      <p>Atlantic Canada and Alberta (each at 71%) boast the highest level of support for hunting animals for meat, and they are joined by most residents of Manitoba and Saskatchewan (69%), British Columbia (65%), Ontario (63%) and Quebec (59%).</p>
      <p>On the fashion angle, killing animals for their fur is regarded negatively by three in four Canadians (75%). If you are already thinking about Christmas gifts, be sure to know that 83% of women, 81% of Ontarians and 79% of British Columbians will not be happy finding anything fur-related under the tree.</p>
      <p>Keeping animals in zoos and aquariums is a significantly more contentious issue. While almost two in five Canadians (39%) favour this custom, a majority (52%) are opposed. The level of animosity towards zoos and aquariums is highest among Ontarians (57%), women (56%), Canadians aged 18 to 34 (also 56%) and Liberal Party voters in the 2019 federal election (54%).</p>
      <p>There is another type of spectacle involving animals that has also generated controversy. Established rodeos, such as the Calgary Stampede, have consistently seen protests, with a particular emphasis on bringing an end to chuckwagon races, in which six horses died during this year’s competition.</p>
      <p>Just under three in five Canadians (59%) are opposed to using animals in rodeos, while one-third (34%) are in favour. Majorities across all three age groups are against this practice, as are more than three in five residents of Atlantic Canada (67%), Quebec (65%) and British Columbia (62%).</p>
      <p>In Manitoba and Saskatchewan, more residents are supportive of using animals in rodeos (50%) than those who are against (43%). In Alberta, the public is evenly split: 49% are in favour of rodeos with animals and 49% are opposed.</p>
      <p>The issue will undoubtedly be re-debated this weekend, as the Canadian Football League (CFL) is organizing a rodeo as part of the Grey Cup festivities in Calgary. When Canadians are asked about the CFL’s decision, more than a third (35%) agree with having the rodeo as part of the league’s marquee weekend, but almost half (46%) disagree.</p>
      <p>Once again, Alberta is divided on tying the CFL to rodeo (40% agree, 43% disagree), but British Columbia has the largest proportion of residents who are not thrilled with the league’s choice (53%).</p>
      <p>The research shows that the public approval of hunting animals for sport is tiny. Many despise the practice of killing animals for their fur, but fewer have a problem with hunting for food.</p>
      <p>The past two weeks have, perhaps accidentally, provided an opportunity for Canadians to take a look at what constitutes a wholesome relationship with long-standing sports customs. At this time, the CFL is seriously pondering expansion to Atlantic Canada, but has gone through a difficult time packing some stadiums, reaching younger demographics and getting people to tune in to games on cable and streaming services</p>
      <p>Within this context, it is important to note that most Canadians are opposed to using animals in rodeos and almost half are not enthused about these spectacles establishing a relationship with the CFL.</p>
