      <p>Tonight on PPV, Deontay Wider will rematch Luis Ortiz for the WBC Heavyweight title in Las Vegas. This is the biggest bump on the road back to Tyson Fury for Wilder, who will get a big payday to fight the lineal champ again if he can get through Ortiz for a second time.</p>
      <p>Wilder (41-0-1, 40 KOs) and Ortiz (31-1, 26 KOs) previously met in 2018 in a very competitive bout that saw Wilder take a 10th-round TKO victory. Wilder then went on to his controversial draw with Fury, while Ortiz has won three straight since.</p>
      <p>This card will cover the rest of the main card, and will also offer up a stream of the undercard for fans.</p>
