      <p>Ajax and visitors Heracles did not kick the ball in the first minute of their Dutch Eredivisie meeting on Saturday, as players protested against racism.</p>
      <p>The Dutch league leaders kicked off, but both sets of players then remained stationary and applauded for the next 60 seconds, with match officials and supporters joining in.</p>
      <p>Clubs across the country's top two divisions agreed to the measure after Excelsior player <a href="http://www.espnfc.com/player/_/id/248542/ahmad-mendes-moreira">Ahmad Mendes Moreira</a> was <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/dutch-eerste-divisie/story/3992744/racially-abused-excelsior-winger-moreira-labelled-pathetic-little-man-by-opposition-manager">subjected to racist abuse by Den Bosch supporters</a> during last Sunday's Eerste Divisie -- Dutch second flight -- match.</p>
      <p>Excelsior got the protests underway on Friday night at the start of their game against Volendam.</p>
      <p>Following the incident, Netherlands internationals <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/159255/Memphis-Depay">Memphis Depay</a> and <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/98342/Georginio-Wijnaldum">Georginio Wijnaldum</a> expressed their shock at the situation.</p>
      <p>Liverpool midfielder <a href="https://twitter.com/ESPNFC/status/1196901217584271361">Wijnaldum appeared to send an anti-racism message</a> when celebrating with international teammate <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/219022/Frenkie-de-Jong">Frenkie de Jong</a> when he scored for Netherlands against Estonia.</p>
