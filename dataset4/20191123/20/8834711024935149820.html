      <h1>Uruguayan Sirino Scores, Red-Carded As Sundowns Reach Final</h1>

      <p>Uruguayan Gaston Sirino scored and was red-carded as Mamelodi Sundowns reached the Telkom Knockout final Saturday with a 2-1 away win over Golden Arrows in Durban.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old Montevideo-born midfielder put Sundowns two goals ahead on 36 minutes of the semi-final when he sidefooted the ball into the net after two blocked shots and a save.</p>
      <p>Sundowns retained that advantage at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium in the Indian Ocean port city until substitute Nduduzo Sibiya netted nine minutes from time with a far-post shot off a cross.</p>
      <p>Almost immediately, Sundowns were reduced to 10 men when the highly skilful Sirino showed his nastier side, deliberately stamping on a foot of Arrows defender Matome Mathiane.</p>
      <p>Arrows gained momentum as they sought a first appearance in the final and three-time League Cup winners Sundowns survived several anxious moments to reach the December 14 title decider.</p>
      <p>Sundowns’ first goal came from veteran midfielder Hlompho Kekana, who took advantage of badly positioned Zimbabwean goalkeeper Edmore Sibanda to powerfully head a free-kick into the net.</p>
      <p>Kaizer Chiefs, who have won the League Cup a record 13 times, play Maritzburg United Sunday in the second semi-final in northeastern city Nelspruit.</p>
