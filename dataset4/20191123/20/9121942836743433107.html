      <p>NORMAN, Okla. (AP) — Jalen Hurts passed for two touchdowns and ran for two more and No. 8 Oklahoma beat TCU 28-24 on Saturday night to clinch a spot in the Big 12 championship game.</p>
      <p>Hurts ran for 173 yards and passed for 145. He became the third Oklahoma quarterback to rush for at least 1,000 yards in a season.</p>
      <p>Kennedy Brooks added 149 yards rushing for the Sooners (10-1, 7-1, No. 9 CFP), who kept their College Football Playoff hopes alive.</p>
      <p>Max Duggan rushed for 92 and a touchdown for the Horned Frogs (5-6, 3-5), who missed a chance to become bowl eligible.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma won its 20th consecutive November game dating to 2014. The Sooners outgained the Horned Frogs 511 yards to 204, but turned the ball over three times.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma ran out to a 21-0 lead and led 21-10 at halftime. Hurts threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score before the break.</p>
      <p>Advertising</p>
      <p>The Sooners led 28-17 and looked ready to put the Horned Frogs away, but Vernon Scott intercepted Hurts and ran it back 98 yards for a touchdown, and TCU cut Oklahoma’s lead to 28-24 with 12:43 to play.</p>
      <p>The Sooners drove again, and Hurts broke a long run before Nook Bradford ripped the ball out of his arm and gained possession in one fluid motion inside the TCU 10rd line.</p>
      <p>TCU drove inside Oklahoma territory, but Brendan Radley-Hiles intercepted Duggan’s pass with 1:41 to play.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma needed a first down to put the game out of reach. On third-and-short, Hurts ran up the middle and was awarded the first down. Upon review, the decision stood.</p>
      <p>THE TAKEAWAY</p>
      <p>TCU: It was the Horned Frogs’ fifth loss by seven points or fewer this season. The passing offense was nearly non-existent, with Duggan completing just 7 of 21 passes for 65 yards.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma: The Sooners, coming off a big win over Baylor, hung on again. Oklahoma’s last three wins have been by one, three and four points. Oklahoma’s defense played lights out and never let TCU get comfortable.</p>
      <p>POLL IMPLICATIONS</p>
      <p>Oklahoma could move up with No. 6 Oregon’s loss to Arizona State.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>

      <p>Oklahoma visits in-state rival Oklahoma State.</p>
