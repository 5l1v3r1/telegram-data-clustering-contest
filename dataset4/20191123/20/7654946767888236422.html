      <h1>Florencio Moran is final victim identified in Chinatown murders after family located in Mexico</h1>

      <p>The city medical examiner released the final body in the Chinatown homeless massacre from the city morgue, where it was kept for seven weeks as authorities searched for the victim’s family.</p>
      <p>The ME’s office and Mexican Consulate found Florencio Moran’s kin in his native Mexico, and they signed off on releasing the body to a funeral home this week, according to a source.</p>
      <p>Moran, 39, was the youngest victim of Randy Santos, who authorities say bludgeoned Moran and three other homeless men to death in <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/05/4-homeless-men-found-murdered-in-chinatown-suspect-in-custody/">the horrific Oct. 5 attack</a>, carried out in the middle of the night as the men slept on the street. A fifth victim survived Santos’ alleged beating.</p>
      <p>Moran was lying along East Broadway when police say Santos, 24, attacked him with a 15-pound metal bar.</p>
      <p>Less is known about Moran than any of the other three victims. He was originally from the state of Guerrero and had been living on the streets of New York City for at least several years.</p>
      <p>Authorities said they were unable to identify him for 12 days after the attack because he carried no identification, and his face was so badly beaten.</p>
      <p>Santos is charged with murder. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/nyregion/homeless-chinatown-murders-randy-santos.html">He claims he does not remember</a> attacking anyone that night, he told the New York Times from Rikers Island in an interview published Monday.</p>
