      <h1>Coach Cal’s Happy Birthday Tweet For His Daughter Is Going Viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:19:10+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday morning, Kentucky head basketball coach John Calipari took to social media for a message for one of his daughters.</p>
      <p>Calipari wished his daughter Megan a happy 29th birthday. There’s only one problem.</p>
      <p>She’s 30 years old.</p>
      <p>Megan wasted no time calling out her father for the error.</p>
      <p>Check it out.</p>

      <p>On this day last year, Calipari posted a message for Megan’s birthday on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UKCoachCalipari/posts/today-is-megan-caliparis-29th-birthday-she-was-born-on-thanksgiving-in-massachus/10157073593813912/">Facebook page</a>. He got her age correct in that post.</p>
      <p>“Today is Megan Calipari’s 29th birthday. She was born on Thanksgiving in Massachusetts during a crazy snow storm and we were pulled over by the police on the way to hospital! I am so proud of the woman she has become. She juggles many responsibilities, yet stays who she is. I will say she was MUCH sweeter at school than she was at home, but living with Erin Siciliano Calipari will do that to you!! Love you, Meg! Dad,” he said on the post.</p>
      <p>Clearly he knows how old she is – or at least knew at one point. Maybe he’s just being nice by keeping her age down, for another year.</p>
      <p>Thanksgiving Dinner might be a little awkward this year.</p>
