      <p>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- An Arizona sheriff's deputy under scrutiny for restraining and wrestling a 15-year-old quadruple amputee during an encounter in a group home says he looks forward to clearing his name and returning to duty.</p>
      <p>Pima County sheriff's Deputy Manuel Van Santen said in a statement released by his lawyer Friday that a widely viewed video showed only part of the Sept. 26 incident that occurred as he responded to a 911 call by a group home worker reporting criminal behavior involving threats and disorderly conduct.</p>
      <p>The video released Nov. 14 by the Pima County Public Defender's Office showed part of the ensuing encounter, with Van Santen wrestling the 15-year-old on the floor and using his body to pin the teen on his side before getting up after about two minutes.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Prosecutors decided to drop charges against the youth immediately after seeing the video, and the Sheriff's Department placed Van Santen on administrative leave pending an investigation.</p>
      <p>The youth's attorney, Assistant Public Defender Samuel Jurgena, has said the deputy's treatment of the youth was appalling.</p>
      <p>The Associated Press is withholding the teen's name because of his age.</p>
      <p>Van Santen's statement said he was cooperating with the investigation.</p>

      <p>"I was there to secure individuals who might be a threat to themselves, the staff and other residents. This was all confirmed upon my arrival and before I entered the building," he said.</p>
      <p>The deputy's initial report from the incident said he grabbed the youth and restrained him to protect the group home manager whom the youth had allegedly threatened.</p>
      <p>Van Santen's statement said he followed his training and directives from the Sheriff's Department. "Nothing more, nothing less."</p>
      <p>"I can look my wife and my children in the face tonight and know that I did my job to the best of my ability. I look forward to clearing my name and returning to duty," the statement said.</p>
