      <h1>Top Navy officials threaten to resign if Trump keeps disgraced SEAL Edward Gallagher</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:19:04+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:19</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Levine</a></address>
      <p>Top officials in the US Navy threatened to resign or be fired should President Trump follow through with an order to keep disgraced Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher in the service, The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/23/us/politics/navy-discipline-edward-gallagher.html">New York Times reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The threats from Navy Secretary Richard Spencer and Rear Adm. Collin Green, who leads the SEALs, left the Department of Defense scrambling for a compromise, the paper reported. Spencer says Gallagher should be judged by his peers.</p>
      <p>“I believe the process matters for good order and discipline,” Spencer told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-military-seals-exclusive/exclusive-us-navy-secretary-backs-seals-expulsion-review-despite-trump-objection-idUSKBN1XW2A2">Reuters</a> while attending Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia, Canada. “I think we have a process in place, which we’re going forward with, and that’s my job.”</p>
      <p>Gallagher was convicted in July of illegally posing with the dead body of an ISIS fighter. The decision resulted in a rank and pay-grade demotion — and potentially the loss of his Navy SEALs Trident Pin.</p>
      <p>The announcement from Spencer puts him on a collision course with Trump, who personally intervened to ensure Gallagher is not expelled from the SEALs and that he would remain entitled to his pension.</p>
      <p>“The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher’s Trident Pin. This case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!” Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1197507542726909952">tweeted</a> Thursday.</p>
