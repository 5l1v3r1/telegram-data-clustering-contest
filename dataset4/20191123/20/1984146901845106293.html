      <p>Motorists were faced with two-hour delays trying to leave a <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-centre">Newcastle city centre</a> car park.</p>
      <p>There was a huge queue at the NCP on John Dobson Street, with traffic tailed back to the 12th floor on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Motorists said they had taken 45 minutes to get down just two floors, while others said they had come earlier and left again hoping traffic would have eased.</p>
      <p>Ollie and Katie Little, who were still waiting after 7pm, first came to the car park at 4pm but were told there was a delay.</p>
      <p>Ollie, 35, said: "We were told there was an hour and a half delay so decided to go for something to eat.</p>
      <p>"We came back and it was just as bad. It was kicking off with people honking their horns.</p>

      <p>"It has been like this since 4pm. It seems like everyone who has come for the market has come to one place."</p>
      <p>One man said: "I came at 5pm and queued for bit and then I parked for 30 mintues.</p>
      <p>"I thought it was easing off so decided to try and leave again, but it is just as bad."</p>
      <p>Two women initially came but when they saw the queue left for a coffee before trying again.</p>
      <p>"We asked someone how long they had been waiting for and they said one hour," the woman said. "We decided to go away and come back. It is ridiculous."</p>
      <p>"I am supposed to be going out with friends," the other said.</p>
      <p>Another man said: "We have been queuing for 45 minutes and have only gone down two floors.</p>
      <p>"There were people further down who said they have been waiting for two hours."</p>
      <p>It comes after <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/shoppers-christmas-rain-weather-traffic-17305686?fbclid=IwAR2w2t9t7E7ZHelX_UrpLFgagj8hhZYASbVzPD-tIKYFSt0XpugZVNVOFY4">motorists faced lengthy delays getting into the city centre car parks</a> before heading for Christmas shopping.</p>
      <p>Queues of traffic could be seen outside Eldon Garden Car Park on Saturday afternoon.</p>
