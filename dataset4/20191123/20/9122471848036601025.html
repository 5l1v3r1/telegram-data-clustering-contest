      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:32:24+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>All anyone could think about before, during and after Ohio State’s win over Penn State on Saturday was the Buckeyes’ contest against Michigan next week. The massive rivalry carries heavy implications this season. So much so that Fox Sports aired an OSU-Michigan hype video during Saturday’s game.</p>
      <p>The video’s commentary highlights both team’s fans and the hatred for each other. Is this the best rivalry in all of sports?</p>
      <blockquote>“It’s complicated. On the outside you act like they don’t even exist. But on the inside, they’re all you think about. Because without <i>that</i> school, we don’t get to have that day – the day you wait all year for. You’re outside might not say their name. But your inside can’t imagine life without them.”</blockquote>
      <p>Check out Fox Sports’ epic hype video for next Saturday’s big time rivalry game below:</p>

      <p>After the Buckeyes’ massive victory over No. 8 Penn State on Saturday, they have a chance to move up to No. 1 in next week’s edition of the CFP rankings. Ohio State certainly has national championship aspirations, but Michigan will do all it can next Saturday to thwart those plans.</p>
      <p>The Wolverines are improving each week and boast an 8-2 record. They’ll look to continue their momentum next Saturday.</p>
      <p>Ohio State-Michigan kicks off next Saturday at noon ET on FOX.</p>
