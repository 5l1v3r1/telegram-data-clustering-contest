      <p>Terrified film fans have described the moment a major brawl broke-out inside a cinema sending screaming children running into the street.</p>
      <p>Star City in Birmingham was locked down this evening after dozens of teenagers ran into the foyer.</p>
      <p>According to witness reports they began punching a lone female who was on the floor, before police officers burst into the cinema.</p>
      <p>Alarmed punters told West Midlands Police that some of the youths were armed with machetes.</p>
      <p>The presence of law enforcement officers caused the brawling teens to flee into the screens in a bid to escape.</p>

      <p>Choleigh McGuire was queueing up to get into a screening of Frozen 2 with her 11-year-old sister when the youths charged through the doors.</p>
      <p>"This group of girls started beating up this one girl," the 25-year-old said.</p>
      <p>"Someone separated it at first but then the other girl's friend started punching her.</p>
      <p>"Security came and broke it up then loads of police came."</p>
      <p>Choleigh said that the first girl beaten by the group was punched about five times before others intervened.</p>
      <p>Her sister was left in a state of shock when police officers armed with Tasers brandished one of the shocking devices towards her face.</p>

      <p>She added: "They pointed the Taser at us and said we had to get out.</p>
      <p>"They threatened to shoot these innocent boys near us. She just kept waiving it around."</p>
      <p>Ashmit Sinha was also waiting to get into a screening when the fight broke out, causing dozens of the young punters dressed as Frozen 2 characters to break into tears.</p>
      <p>"A huge fight breaks out and it was really scary," she said.</p>
      <p>"Police had Tasers and there were just a bunch of confused little children, who just wanted to watch a movie, crying."</p>

      <p>One woman wrote: "I really hope everyone is okay especially the children.</p>

      <p>"We got locked in the arcade (while) the police throw everyone out. (I'm) still a bit shaken."</p>

      <p>Shortly before 8pm the police confirmed that they had made several arrests and that officers had been attacked in the line of duty.</p>
      <p>The force tweeted: "Officers arrived to find a group of more than 100 people, and pockets of fighting broke out as police moved to clear the area.</p>
      <p>"A number of police officers have been assaulted, and several arrests have been made.</p>
      <p>"A dispersal order has been out in place giving officers the power to move on groups of people and arrest those who fail to leave.</p>
      <p>"Officers remain at the scene and are liaising closely with management at the venue. Motorists are urged to avoid the area because of traffic build-up."</p>
