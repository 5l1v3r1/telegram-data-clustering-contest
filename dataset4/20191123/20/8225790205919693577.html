      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - Hang on to your hats -- and umbrellas! Strong and gusty trade winds and a trough aloft will bring some rather wet and blustery weather to the island chain. A wind advisory remains in effect for most of Maui County and the Big Island, where winds will be strongest in downslope areas with gusts near 50 miles per hour possible.</p>
      <p>Thereʻs also an area of moisture racing in from the east that will increase the chances for rain, with brief downpours and isolated thunderstorms possible as well. Any downpours or thunderstorms shouldn’t last long as they are pushed along by the winds.</p>
      <p>It’s also active out in the ocean, with a high surf advisory for east-facing shores due to a rough and choppy swell generated by the strong trades. An advisory may be issued later today for the north and west shores of most of the smaller islands for a new swell peaking tonight into Sunday.</p>
      <p>For mariners, a gale warning is posted for waters around Maui County and the Big Island, with a small craft advisory for remaining coastal waters.</p>
