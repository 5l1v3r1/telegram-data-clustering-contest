      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/pete-davidson/">Pete Davidson</a> and Kaia Gerber did not hold back on a spot of PDA as the couple were seen enjoying a poolside date in Miami.</p>
      <p>The two were spotted in the Florida city as they soaked up the sunshine, and were not afraid to pucker up while they were at it.</p>
      <p>So they are pretty much official now, right?</p>
      <p>Kaia sported a black bikini and a huge pair of shades, while Pete looked casual in shorts and a graphic t-shirt, while he also wore his own pair of sunglasses.</p>
      <p>The couple could be seen relaxing on the sunbeds before they both decided to lean in for a kiss, and at one point, their tongues were clearly on display.</p>

      <p>And they were also spotted looking very smitten as they later enjoyed a dip in the pool together, as the funnyman carried a drink in his hand.</p>

      <p>Pete first sparked rumours he was dating the daughter of Cindy Crawford after the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/24/pete-davidson-sparks-romance-rumours-kaia-gerber-cosy-lunch-date-split-margaret-qualley-10974786/">two were spotted enjoying a lunch date in October.</a></p>
      <p>The comedian also reportedly visited Kaia at her apartment that same day, although a source told <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/10/23/pete-davidson-seen-leaving-kaia-gerbers-apartment-building/">PageSix</a> that the two were simply ‘just friends’.</p>

      <p>A few weeks later, Kaia attended the Women’s Guild Cedars-Sinai Annual Luncheon at the Beverly Wiltshire Hotel, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/cindy-crawfords-daughter-kaia-gerber-sports-p-letter-necklace-amid-pete-davidson-dating-rumours-11066449/">notably wore a necklace with the letter ‘P’ written on it.</a></p>
      <p>Last week, the 18-year-old model <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/things-appear-to-be-getting-serious-as-kaia-gerber-personally-delivers-birthday-cake-to-pete-davidson-11170866/">surprised Pete with a personally-delivered birthday cake</a>, as the SNL star celebrated turning 26.</p>
      <p>She was seen leaving the famous Magnolia Bakery in New York City carrying a white paper bag, and she was papped later that evening entering the NBC Studios (where Pete films Saturday Night Live) carrying the exact same bag.</p>
