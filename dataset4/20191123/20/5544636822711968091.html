      <p>Manchester City moved backed to third in the Premier League table on Saturday after coming from behind to claim a valuable 2-1 win at home to Chelsea.</p>
      <p>Although the victory was marred by injury concerns for Rodri, David Silva and Sergio Aguero.</p>
      <p>Chelsea opened the scoring through N’Golo Kante who was marking his 150th Chelsea appearance before City hit back to lead at the interval thanks to Kevin De Bruyne’s deflected strike and a fine solo effort from Riyad Mahrez.</p>
      <p>After losing at title rivals Liverpool in their last game before the international break, City crucially got back to winning ways despite a strangely low-tempo performance at the Etihad Stadium, where three key players limped off during the second half.</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard’s side defeat ended a six-game winning streak in the league and denied the Blues the chance to set a club record of eight straight victories away from home in all competitions.</p>
