      <p><a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/bollywood/adah-sharma-killing-looks-in-a-revealing-bikini/">Adah Sharma</a> has been that actress who has been doing films in multiple languages including Telugu and Hindi, but uck seems to be hiding from her. Her last release ‘Kalki’ with senior hero Rajasekhar bombed big time.</p>
      <p>There was a rumor that the milky beauty has been dating a businessman. Giving clarity on the rumor, Adah Sharma who seems to be surprised asked who that businessman was. She said that she was very much single.</p>
      <p>If one looks at her priority list for a prospective husband, it’s better not to ask her. She needs a man who can make perfect round dosas with the best chutney. You know that she is an animal lover and she wants her man to be one.</p>
      <p>There is one more. He should do backflips. This one seems to be an unconventional demand for a guy who would make her husband. Coming to her films, the actress needs a solid role to make her presence felt.</p>
