      </p>
      <p>For the past 20 years, Bayelsa state, located in the Delta region, has been one of the strongholds of the PDP and a victory for the APC in the state seemed like a tall dream until it occurred.</p>
      <p>But how did the APC record the unexpected victory by polling 352,552 votes above the PDP which scored 143,172 votes? The answer to that question started trickling-in shortly when events unfolded moments after the results of the poll were announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).</p>
      <p>In Otuoke, Bayelsa state, some leaders of the APC visited former president, Goodluck Jonathan, at his country home. Those who paid Jonathan a visit included Governor Muhammadu Badaru of <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/jigawa-state-news-today.html">Jigawa</a> state and Senator Ita Enang, the minister of state for petroleum resources Timipre Sylva, and other APC party members.</p>

      <p>Badaru who served as the chairman of the APC campaign organisation for the Bayelsa governorship election and other party members shared warm greetings with the former president in what looked like a celebration of the crushing defeat of the PDP according to photos shared on social media.</p>

      <p>Jonathan’s meeting with the party leaders added force to the speculation that the former president was supporting David Lyon of the APC instead of Senator Douye Diri of the PDP.</p>
      <p>There were reports that Jonathan had wanted Timi Alaibe, a former managing director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) as the PDP candidate but that the outgoing governor Seriake Dickson kicked and instead, supported Senator Diri, who eventually picked the ticket.</p>
      <p>Dickson had also been accused of side-lining the former president and his allies in the scheme of things, all in a move to have his chosen candidate as successor. He was said to have jettisoned the age-long rotation arrangement between the three senatorial districts of the state.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It is a known fact that Dickson’s rise to the governorship seat was with the help of Jonathan but the governor having spent 8 years in <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1256503-power-season-6-cast-episodes-where-to-watch.html">power</a> so became confident of winning the election for the PDP without the support of his godfather.</p>

      </p>
      <p>As regards Jonathan, though the former president has not verbally indicated that he worked against the PDP in the Bayelsa governorship election, however, the fact that the APC recorded over 40,000 votes in Ogbia local government area of the state, where Jonathan hails from, heightened the suspicion that the former president might have helped the APC’s chances in the poll.</p>

      <p>Also, the visit by the APC governor-elect along with some party members, shortly after the results of the election were announced took many by surprise.</p>
      <p>But the most audacious act occurred when a foremost Ijaw leader and a chieftain of APC, Hon Prince Kakas Amgbare reportedly commended Goodluck Jonathan and the party’s leader in the state, Chief Timipre Sylva, for ensuring a change in government in Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>But while wagging tongues allege that Jonathan must have colluded with the APC in the <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1274863-bayelsa-governorship-election-speaker-defect-pdp-apc.html">Bayelsa election</a>, it appears the PDP has chosen to exonerate the former president from alleged antiparty activities.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP, for now, maintains that it does not have any issue against former president concerning the conduct governorship election in Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>As stated in a report in the New telegraph dated November 21, the national publicity secretary, of the party Kola Ologbondiyan appears to have exonerated of any ant wrongdoing when he said:</p>
      <p><i>“If we do not have a report or an issue before us, we cannot delve into it. As we speak now, we do not have matter concerning President Jonathan before the party</i>."</p>
      <p>Despite all the rumours, the PDP, for now, believes that Jonathan has not committed any violation that can be termed as anti-party. So I leave the matter in the court of public opinion, what do you think? Is Oga GEJ guilty of working against the PDP in the Bayelsa election?</p>
