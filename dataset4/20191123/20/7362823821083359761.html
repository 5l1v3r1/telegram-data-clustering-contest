      <p>Shalena Lopez, 31, and one of the men, Mario Gaona, 39, were <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-boy-13-arrested-in-school-shooting-threat">arrested</a> Thursday, the sheriff's office said in a <a href="https://tularecounty.ca.gov/sheriff/index.cfm/media/news-releases/dating-site-meet-up-ends-in-trip-to-casino-robbery/">news release</a> Friday.</p>

      <p>“The ‘relative’ of the woman then threatened him with a gun,” authorities said. “The victim was told to drive to an AM/PM [convenience store] in Porterville and withdraw money from the ATM.”</p>
      <p>The victim complied out of fear and gave the money to one of the men who had walked into the store with him, according to the release.</p>
      <p>"Eventually he dropped them all off and was allowed to leave," the news release said.</p>
