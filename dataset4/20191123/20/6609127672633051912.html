      <p>The pervert was put on the sex offenders register after being found guilty of 15 sexual assault charges during a two-year sleaze campaign at the Ship Inn in Banff, Aberdeenshire.</p>
      <p>One victim said: “Sometimes you get off-colour things said in pubs but this happened all day, every day.</p>
      <p>“He didn’t think there was anything wrong with it and he classed it as banter. But the reality is that he’s a sleazy old man.”</p>
      <p>The town’s sheriff court heard Wood sent a barrage of creepy messages inviting women to come to the pub as his wife Margaretann Johnstone slept.</p>

      <p>He also tried to snog others and made explicit and suggestive remarks.</p>
      <p>One local said of the pest’s conviction earlier this year: “The pub has been quiet ever since. It seems it’s hardly open.</p>
      <p>“George was a regular fixture but now he’s not allowed in. He doesn’t even walk through when he takes the dog out.”</p>
      <p>As well as being placed on the sex offenders register for three years, Wood was given a community payback order and ordered to take part in a rehabilitation programme.</p>

      <p>Sheriff Gary Aitken told him: “There needs to be an adjustment in your attitude towards certain things and your perception of what is just banter or funny.”</p>
      <p>Wood’s solicitor Debbie Wilson revealed her client was getting counselling to deal with his behaviour.</p>
      <p>She said: “It’s thrown him. The thing that he thought was helping sell the pub was harming it.”</p>
      <p>In 2017, we told how<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/1891957/husband-wife-neighbour-coffee-attack-aberdeen/"> Wood admitted assaulting neighbour Paschal Mohan</a> by throwing him against a wall after Margaret­ann slipped out of bed at night to go for coffee with him.</p>
      <p>The boozed-up lout also pled guilty to behaving in a threatening and abusive manner towards his wife.</p>
