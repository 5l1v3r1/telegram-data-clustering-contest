      <p>"A dispersal order has been out in place giving officers the power to move on groups of people and arrest those who fail to leave.</p>
      <p>"Officers remain at the scene and are liaising closely with management at the venue. Motorists are urged to avoid the area because of traffic build-up."</p>
      <p>One witness told Mirror Online: "That's probably one of the scariest moments of my life. Me and my daughter were in a queue to watch frozen, loads of little kids there, all dressed up and everything, then these girls jumped on another girl and loads of these kids just started fighting.</p>
      <p>"Armed police came with Tasers. All the people that were fighting run off into the cinema. There's about 15 to 20 police cars. I'm shaking.</p>
      <p>"The police were very aggressive there was lots of little kids there.</p>
      <p>"My sister is 11 and they was pointing the Tasers in our face."</p>
      <p>Another witness said: "This is the most horrifying thing I’ve been involved in I’m scared and I’m 45 little girls dressed in frozen dresses crying and screaming appalling behaviour all over a gangster film set in London."</p>

      <p>Choleigh Mcguire, who was at the complex, told Mirror Online: "I have never seen police so aggressive. Everyone dressed up. They were all crying. It was a group of girls started on this one girl. Someone separated it at first.</p>
      <p>"The other girls friend started punching her. Security came and broke it up then loads of police come.</p>
      <p>"They ran into the cinema screens. Altogether at least 25 people that ran into the cinema rooms. We were right by the cinema rooms waiting to get popcorn, had paid for tickets online</p>

      <p>"We couldn't stay in the queue, They pointed the Taser at us and said we had to get out. They threatened to shoot these innocent boys near us.</p>
      <p>"The Taser was pointed at us about a metre away. She just kept waving it around.</p>
      <p>"Security guard started pushing us out.</p>
      <p>Mr Khan, manager of Pepe’s Restaurant at the centre told BirminghamLive: "I heard shouting and screaming outside the restaurant. I understand a big fight started in the cinema.</p>

      <p>"There were so many people running past the restaurant, I’d say around 60 to 70 were involved.</p>
      <p>"The police escorted everyone out.</p>
      <p>"We’ve heard that the cinema has had to empty the screens and are not letting anyone else in. I guess people who have bought tickets will get a refund.</p>
      <p>"Our restaurant is still open, as is the restaurant next door."</p>

      <p>"Armed police came in. To me, it seems like a massive overreaction.</p>
      <p>"I'd say they hit her about five times. My sister hasn't really spoken."</p>
      <p>Star City is a popular entertainment complex, with restaurants, shops, a bowling alley and other attractions.</p>
