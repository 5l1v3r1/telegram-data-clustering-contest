      <p>Joao Moutinho says it was ‘a very easy decision’ to sign up for another two years at Wolverhampton Wanderers.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese midfielder is one of the most popular players in Nuno Espirito Santo’s set-up, with some supporters even suggesting he’s the best <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> player they’ve seen.</p>
      <p>And news that he’s signed a new two-year contract with the club, which ties him to Wolverhampton until at least 2022, has delighted fans.</p>
      <p>It arrives on the back of yet another Moutinho masterclass with his free-kick goal setting Wolves on their way to a 2-1 win over Bournemouth today which puts them fifth in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Speaking about his new contract, <a href="https://www.wolves.co.uk/news/first-team/20191123-moutinho-signs-new-wolves-contract/">Moutinho said:</a> “It was a very easy decision because I feel very good here. It’s a big club that wants to do something good and I want to do my best to help.</p>
      <p>“We did a great job last season and this season we’ll try to do better. That’s what we’re going to do and I’m going to try 100 per cent to help the club to improve.</p>
      <p>“I feel very good. We won today, a very important win, and I signed a new contract. I’m very happy to help the team today and I hope to help the new for the new two, three years.”</p>
