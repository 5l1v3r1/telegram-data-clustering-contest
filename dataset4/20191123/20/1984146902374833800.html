      <p>Strictly Come Dancing judge Bruno Tonioli is rarely the villain on the show, but that all changed on Saturday night when he was viciously booed by dancers and the studio audience.</p>
      <p>And it was all down to his harsh score to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/chris-ramsey">Chris Ramsey.</a> The South Shields comedian and professional partner Karen Hauer danced a paso doble to Run Boy Run on this weekend's live show and, unlike for other performances during the show, even Craig Revel-Horwood was impressed!</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/strictly-dancing-judge-craig-scores-17307020">Craig had been slammed by Strictly viewers for his scores,</a> which saw him award Saffron &amp; AJ just 5 for their samba and Alex &amp; Neil even less, giving them a poor 4 for their Argentine tango.</p>
      <p>In contrast, Craig told Chris he loved his paso and awarded him 8 as did Motsi Mabuse and head judge Shirley Ballas and it was Bruno who was the bad guy, giving them a 7.</p>
      <p><i><b>And as you can see in the video above taken from the BBC</b> </i>, Bruno's mark prompted a huge chorus of boos in the studio as people were quick to voice their disapproval.</p>
      <p>In a memorable night for Bruno, the always excitable Italian <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/bruno-tonioli-singing-strictly-video-17306885">kicked things off by singing</a> , much to the shock of millions of viewers at home.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere there was drama when Tess Daly had to come to the rescue after a microphone malfunction led to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/strictly-alex-neil-stuck-together-17306971">Alex &amp; Neil getting stuck together.</a></p>
      <p>Kelvin &amp; Oti topped the leaderboard this week with a score of 38 for their Northern Soul inspired Couples Choice dance.</p>
