      <h1>Section of Fleet Street to go car-free starting Monday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:08:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:08</time> by <a rel="author">Bryann Aguilar, CP24.com</a></address>
      <p>The city is dedicating a stretch of a waterfront street to cyclists and pedestrians, closing it to cars and trucks permanently.</p>
      <p>The westbound lane of Fleet Street between Bathurst and Iannuzzi Streets will only be open to pedestrians and cyclists starting on Monday.</p>
      <p>It comes as a part of the city's <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/fleet-street/">Vision Zero plan</a> to 'normalize' the busy intersection and improve road safety.</p>
      <p>According to the city, the <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/home/media-room/news-releases-media-advisories/?nrkey=4A01A16E4551C8C1852584BA004DBA17">five-arm, high-collision</a> intersection has been a problematic location. It poses danger to pedestrians and cyclists, causes delays to streetcars, and confuses drivers.</p>
      <p>"This is a significant, immediate action that will enhance safety for all road users in the adjacent neighbourhoods of Bathurst Quay, Fort York and CityPlace," said Mayor John Tory in a statement.</p>
      <p>The city said the closure will shorten crossing distances for pedestrians and improve traffic for the 509 and 511 streetcars.</p>
      <p>"No amount of injuries on our streets is acceptable. Iâ€™m glad to see this critical first step in our plan for Bathurst and Fleet being implemented to finally make this intersection safer," Ward 10 Councillor Joe Cressy said.</p>
      <p>The city said it is part of a long-term strategy to reconfigure the intersection and create a new public space in the area.</p>
