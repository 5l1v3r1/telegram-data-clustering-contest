      <p>"Or even when I get a role, I’m made to feel like, well, of course, we’re going to have to do something about that," the 40-year-old added in reference to an unnamed female co-star who said their on-screen relationship seemed unlikely because of their height difference.</p>

      <p>“I was like, ‘All right, now I’ve got to pretend that I really like you for eight more weeks. This is going to be really tough, because you’re so far up yourself.’ It got really interesting, that relationship,” McAvoy continued said.</p>
