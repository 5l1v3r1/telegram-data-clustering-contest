      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/simon-cowell/">Simon Cowell</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/louis-walsh/">Louis Walsh</a> put Nicole Sherzinger on the spot on tonight’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a>: Celebrity as they pretty much confirmed her romance with Try Star’s Thom Evans.</p>
      <p>Try Star opened the show on Saturday by singing The Greatest Show from the hit movie The Greatest Showman – and it was brilliant.</p>
      <p>Simon couldn’t help but smile as he gave Louis a wink before Nicole started commenting on the act.</p>
      <p>‘Oh my gosh this is the greatest show and that was the greatest way to open the show.’ she began.</p>
      <p>‘Three rugby players who turned out to be true showmen, gentlemen and you look like a million bucks.’</p>
      <p>Louis and Simon couldn’t help but add fuel to the fire as the Irishman added: ‘Nicole I agree with you but you love this act a lot, she sees something in this group that we don’t. She genuinely cares about them Simon.</p>

      <p>Simon continued: ‘I agree she is invested in the act, she likes the act.’</p>

      <p>It was recently reported that the 41-year-old Pussycat Dolls singer and the 34-year-old rugby star spent a romantic evening together, with insiders claiming that the pair flirted for weeks before the Try Star member plucked up the courage to ask her out.</p>
      <p>‘Thom is completely Nicole’s type,’ a source revealed. ‘And for his part, Thom was smitten early on — he’s always said Nicole is one of the most beautiful women in the world.</p>
      <p>‘He fancied her long before meeting her on the show. He was initially a bit nervous about starting something up and ruining his chances on the series, but they had great chemistry from the off.’</p>
      <p>The insider continued to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10361248/nicole-scherzinger-secretly-dating-thom-evans/">The Sun</a>: ‘And after weeks of texting, Thom finally plucked up the courage to ask her out, and took her for dinner.’</p>
      <p>According to the source, Nicole and Thom initially met up for drinks as friends but want to see whether they could take their relationship to the next level once X Factor: Celebrity has wrapped.</p>
      <p>Thom is currently a contestant on the spin-off series and is a member of the band Try Star, alongside rugby internationals Ben Foden and Levi Davis.</p>
