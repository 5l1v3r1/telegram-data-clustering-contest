        <b>Speaking to Róisín Upton, it’s clear that the joy of qualification for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo hasn’t faded.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Upton stepped up to score the crucial penalty in sudden death in the deciding play-off against Canada at Donnybrook’s Energia Park, with Ayeisha McFerran’s follow-up sealing the victory.</p>
      <p>Upton told BuzzSport: “It’s just started to sink in a small bit now. The atmosphere was absolutely phenomenal, the place was booming with over 6,000 fans.</p>
      <p>“It was unlike anything we’ve experienced in Ireland before.”</p>
      <p>Upton’s heroics were even more remarkable as she subsequently discovered she’d fractured a bone in her wrist during the game!</p>

      <p>“It was a physical game and I took a few knocks. I remember I’d just played a long pass and I felt something wasn’t right in my wrist,” she said.</p>
      <p>“There was this unbelievable pain and even opening my bag after it was hurting. I got a scan the next day and found out I’d fractured a bone in my wrist.”</p>
      <p>A lot of players would feel the pressure of such an important penalty shoot-out, but Upton prefers to be in the thick of it.</p>
      <p>“I’d always prefer to be taking one actually. I don’t like looking in [on a shoot-out] with too much time to think.”</p>
      <p>She was full of praise for goalkeeper McFerran, who made two crucial saves.</p>
      <p>“The girls were phenomenal and I think some people had us written off, especially when we were 3-1 down.</p>
      <p>“Canada had three or four chances to kill us off but thankfully Ayeisha came up with some wonderful saves and we took our chance.”</p>
      <p>The Irish Women’s Hockey Team won the hearts of the nation with their stunning run to the final of the 2018 World Cup.</p>
      <p>And while they all made lifelong memories that summer, Olympic qualification has also been the main goal, according to Upton.</p>
      <p>“That was phenomenal but I think this was a little bit better [qualifying for the Olympics]. To do it on home soil in front of so many friends and family was even sweeter,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We’ll always have the World Cup but the Olympics is the big one. So many people travelled across to London but we had a huge home crowd here this time.”</p>

      <p>Graham Shaw left to take the job as head coach of New Zealand but the transition was seamless under new head coach Sean Dancer.</p>
      <p>Upton revealed it was a case of keeping most things the same with a few tactical tweaks.</p>
      <p>“There was a period of 5 or 6 weeks that we had an interim coach so he was probably assessing our game then,” she said.</p>
      <p>“He said there were a lot of things he wanted to keep the same, like our defensive qualities, and a few things to work on too like our scoring.”</p>
      <p>Upton spent three years at the University of Connecticut, captaining the Hockey team to the NCCA title in 2014.</p>
      <p>“It was really a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I had only planned to go over for a year but ended up staying for three.”</p>
      <p>Now back at home, Upton is happy in Ireland but she hasn’t ruled out playing in one of the top European leagues one day.</p>
      <p>“It’s a chance to immerse yourself in a new culture and do some travelling, from talking to the others [about their experiences playing in Europe], it’s definitely something I’d like to try.”</p>

      <p>The hardest thing for Upton and her international teammates is training like professionals, putting in the hours on top of work and study.</p>
      <p>Upton recently completed a Masters in Primary Education at Limerick’s Mary Immaculate College, which wasn’t easy on top of training and travel to Dublin.</p>
      <p>“It was really tough, you’re doing 25-30 a week including placement and then there’s the gym and training on top of that,” she explained.</p>
      <p>A place in the Olympics has always been the goal though and that’s what makes it all worthwhile for Upton.</p>
      <p>So what’s the limit for this team? There is none and they genuinely believe they can provide a big upset like they did at the World Cup.</p>
      <p>“The World Cup definitely put us on the map. There’s only 12 teams, compared to the 16 in the World Cup, so the competition is elite.</p>
      <p>“Qualification has always been the goal but Sean was clear in his message to us that it’s just a stepping stone. The new goal will be trying to win a medal in Tokyo."</p>
