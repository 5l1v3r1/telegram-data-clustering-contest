      <p>He told of his plans for the farewell in Tyndrum, Stirlingshire, after being given <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4726839/paisley-dad-son-dying-murdered-thug/">12 months to live</a> during his battle with brain cancer.</p>
      <p>The grandad said: “My faith tells me I am leaving here and going to see Craig.</p>
      <p>"I genuinely believe that’s what will happen.</p>
      <p>“I’ve decided I am just going to be burned and be scattered in the same place as my son.</p>
      <p>"We sprinkled his ashes at the most beautiful pond in July.”</p>
      <p>Family man Craig McClelland, 31, was knifed by James Wright, 26, in Paisley in July 2017.</p>
      <p>Michael also begged law chiefs for answers on why Wright was able to stab his son while on the run after sabotaging his ankle tag.</p>
      <p>Wright is serving 20 years for the 2017 killing in Paisley.</p>
      <p>Michael has been told a decision on whether to launch a fatal accident inquiry is due within weeks.</p>
      <p>He added: “We need answers. This will be my last Christmas.”</p>
      <p>A Crown Office spokesman said: “We are aware of the importance of this decision for the family and will inform them as soon as possible.”</p>
