      <p>Catch Hospitality Group has disclosed that point-of-sale systems (POS) at NYC hotspots Catch NYC, Catch Rooftop, and Catch Steak were infected with malware that allowed attackers to steal credit card information from customers.</p>
      <p>According to Catches 'payment card incident' notice, the POS malware was active at Catch NYC and Catch Rooftop between March 19, 2019 and October 17, 2019. For Catch Steak, which opened for business on September 18th, the malware was active between September 17, 2019 and October 17, 2019.</p>
      <p>On infected devices, the malware would attempt to steal track data encoded on the magnetic stripe of credit cards. This data includes the credit card number, expiration date, and internal verification code. In some cases, the track data could also include the customer's name, which would be stolen as well.</p>
      <p>Catch <a href="http://catchrestaurants.com/catchnyc/paymentcardincident">explains</a> that not all POS devices were affected and they use two different point-of-sale (POS) devices when customers make payments; one that is brought to your table by waitstaff and stationary ones at the bar and where the waitstaff enter orders. As the portable POS devices utilize point-to-point encryption, payments at the table were not affected.</p>
      <p>"Catch NYC and Catch Steak use two different POS devices – one that is brought by the waitstaff to a table and another at the bar and areas where dining area waitstaff enter orders for the kitchen. Almost all of the dining area transactions occur on devices brought to a guest at the table. Those transactions were not involved in this incident because those devices use point-to-point encryption technology. The cards involved in this incident are cards used at the bar or in the rare circumstances that a card was swiped at the device where waitstaff enter orders."</p>
      <p>Any customer who used their credit cards at Catch restaurants during these time frames should check their old credit card statements and monitor future ones for unauthorized activity. If any unknown charges are found, they should immediately contact their credit card issuer.</p>
      <p>Just last month, POS malware <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/four-us-food-chains-disclose-payment-card-theft-via-pos-malware/">was also found</a> at the McAlister's, Moe's, Schlotzsky, and Hy-Vee US restaurant chains.</p>
