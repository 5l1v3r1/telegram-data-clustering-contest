      <h1>Soko Loco is an adorable train tycoon from some prolific indies</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:39:50+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/jonathan-bolding/" target="_blank">Jonathan Bolding</a></address>
      <p>The creators over at <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/tag/sokpop-collective/"><u>Sokpop Collective</u></a> have cranked out a full game, which they sometimes do between making two full games every month for literally years now. Soko Loco Deluxe is a train tycoon with simple, relaxing gameplay and an adorable lofi aesthetic. It also has a pretty jammin chiptune soundtrack. Sokpop’s games are often fascinating little ideas, but are only rarely expanded into full-featured games. Soko Loco Deluxe definitely deserved the treatment. </p>

      <p>Soko Loco is a nice change of pace from games like Transport Fever or Railway Empire or Mashinsky, all of which I love, but which can get quite complex at times. The design of Soko Loco simplifies the whole genre down to a puzzle of limited space, placement, and optimization. It only uses four resources and would make an excellent first game in the genre for those introducing friends and/or loved ones to their favorite time-consuming hobby. I’ve played about half the game and love what it does.</p>
      <p>Based out of Utrecht, Sokpop Collective is a four-person indie thinktank/brainbox/incubatorium which runs <a href="https://www.patreon.com/sokpop"><u>a Patreon</u></a> that funds the release of two games every month. They released the <a href="https://sokpop.itch.io/soko-loco"><u>original Soko Loco on itch.io</u></a> a little over a year ago, for $3.00, and it has since been expanded by <a href="https://twitter.com/rubna_/status/1194682733093670919"><u>one of their developers</u></a> into this full release.</p>
