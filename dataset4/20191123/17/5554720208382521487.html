      <p><i>Bigg Boss </i>host Salman Khan on Saturday night minced no words while admonishing Siddharth Shukla and Asim Riaz for their repeated violence in the show last week. However, the biggest revelation on the show was Salman spilling the beans on how the creative team of the Colors TV reality show orchestrated fights among housemates.</p>

      <p>Salman started the show by expressing his disgust for the housemates adding that the week gone by was the worst week in the history of the <i>Bigg Boss </i>show. Revealing how the format of the show entailed its creative team orchestrating fights among the contestants, Salman said, “This is the format of the <i>Bigg Boss</i> show. If you don’t fight, the creative team will make you fight. But this time the creative team is not making you fight. You are doing it on your own.”</p>

      <p>Continuing his tirade, Salman said, “Hurl abuses to each other’s mothers and sisters… Call each other names..This would affect me earlier, but this doesn’t bother me any longer..This is your life, destroy your life if you want…You are not 15-16-year-old kids. You are not in school and I am not here to act as your principal. Is this a remand home? Not really.”</p>

      <p>He dared the housemates to hit each other and not merely threaten but they wouldn’t do so since they were well aware that their action will invite the wrath of the law enforcing agencies.</p>
      <p>He told Siddharth Shukla and Asim Riaz that they were like two brothers but now fighting like ‘dogs.’</p>
      <p>Salman also expressed his surprise in how contestants were allowed to stay in the show despite indulging in physical violence. “I don’t know about Colors TV and Endemol. I’ve been a part of this show for so many seasons but never before has it happened that a contestant pushing other contestants has stayed in the house.” Salman declared.</p>
