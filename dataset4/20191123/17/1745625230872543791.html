      <p>R&amp;B and hip-hop royalty <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/mary-j-blige/">Mary J. Blige</a> sent fans into a frenzy with a glamorous throwback photo shared to Instagram on November 21.</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old “Thick of It” songstress celebrated “Throwback Thursday” in great style, treating her following to an iconic snap shot 14 years ago for her 2005 album,<i> The Breakthrough</i>. The eye-catching pic saw the stunner looking fierce and phenomenal in a chic all-white ensemble that left little to the imagination. Mary wore a plunging waistcoat-style top that put her shapely bust front and center. The daring garment was a button-down, halterneck design that beautifully showcased her ample decolletage area. The item featured a dangerously low-cut neckline that showed a generous amount of cleavage, leaving a large portion of her chest exposed.</p>
      <p>The snug top fit her like a glove, hugging her curves in all the right places — and highlighting her taut waistline in the process. A pair of silver chain necklaces adorned her decolletage, further luring the gaze to her perky chest. One of the necklaces sported an elegant, rhinestone encrusted, heart-shaped pendant. Mary wore the eye-popping piece in a tight loop around the neck. The second necklace featured a long chain that reached all the way to her chest and ended in a massive cross pendant, which was also encrusted with white stones.</p>
      <p>Mary topped off her fabulous look with a stylish bucket hat in a matching white color. She further accessorized with a set of statement hoop earrings — a massive, teardrop-shaped design that dangled up to her shoulders, sparkling with the same silvery shine as the rest of her sensational bling.</p>

      <p>Mary’s glam was also on point. The “No More Drama” hitmaker highlighted her beautiful features with a dramatic cat-eye makeup done in bold dark eyeliner. She also wore a subtle shimmering eyeshadow and curled her eyelashes with a thin mascara. She plumped up her luscious lips with a glossy nude lipstick that kept the focus on her deep brown eyes.</p>
      <p>The photo was closely cropped to her bust and gorgeous face. As such, the Instagram update only teased Mary’s <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5748176/mary-j-blige-striped-blazer/">incredible figure</a>. The “Be Without You” chart-topper appeared to be posing with her hands on her hips — a posture that showcased her sculpted shoulders and offered a glimpse of her slender arms.</p>
      <p>As her loyal fans will remember, a full-body version of the portrait was featured on the back cover of “The Breakthrough” album. The photo was famously shot by award-winning fashion and celebrity photographer, Markus Klinko — who did the entire artwork for the album cover — and showed her rocking white straight-leg trousers, a black pair of heels, and a black trench coat, which she wore open and over her shoulders.</p>
