      <p>Talking about the film’s box-office collections, Pagalpanti had a rather slow start at the box-office. The film managed to collect a total of Rs. 5 crore nett on its opening day. The major chunk of the collections came from Mumbai (Rs.1.60 crore), Delhi / UP (Rs. 1.15 crore) each and East Punjab (Rs. 49 Lakhs). The film performed poorly in Rajasthan and Gujarat. It will be interesting to see how the film goes on to perform during the weekend. <br/><br/>Directed by Anees Bazmee, Pagalpanti features an ensemble cast comprising John Abraham, Anil Kapoor, Arshad Warsi, Pulkit Samrat, Ileana D’Cruz, Kriti Kharbanda and Urvashi Rautela.</p>
