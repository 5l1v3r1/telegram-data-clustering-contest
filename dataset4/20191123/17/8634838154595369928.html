      <p>According to a report by <i>The Standard</i> on August 26, the former PM had warned anybody who would stand in the way of the BBI report, comparing the document to a tsunami.</p>
      <p>"I have seen a storm, there are signs that it will rain. There’s is a storm that will take all the<i> tanga tanga </i>people to the ocean,” Raila warned during a rally held in Kibra.</p>
      <p>Ruto on Saturday urged citizens to maintain a sober mind while engaging in debates about the BBI report that would be presented before President Uhuru Kenyatta on November 26, 2019. </p>

      <p>The DP stated that Kenyans would have the final say and warned leaders against issuing threats and intimidating the people.</p>
      <p>He insisted that all Kenyans are equal and that all their opinions matter, irrespective of their social status.</p>
      <p>“The debate should be done soberly and peacefully with no threats, propaganda or intimidations. What we know in Jubilee Party is that every opinion counts and must be respected,” the DP stated.</p>
      <p>“No one should look down upon Kenyans because of their status in society,” he added.</p>
      <p>Ruto asked leaders not to use the BBI report to divide Kenyans along political and tribal affiliations. Instead, use the report as a platform to address issues affecting the country and work together towards finding respective solutions and thus develop as a country.</p>
      <p>“When the report is out, all Kenyans will have the opportunity to read and give an opinion on what they think is good for the country with the aim of finding solutions to our problems,” the DP stated.</p>
      <p>The DP preached the need for collective efforts towards the development of the country when he addressed Kenyans from Ngobit Ward during an empowerment programme for women groups at Makutano Shalom grounds in Ngobit, Laikipia County.</p>
