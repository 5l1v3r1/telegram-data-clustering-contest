      <p>Flipp Dinero had 2018 on lock with the release of "Leave Me Alone." It was the banger that helped catch the attention of <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/DJKhaled/profile">DJ Khaled</a> but also the rest of Hollywood's elite. He finally released his new project, <i>Love For Guala, </i>yesterday which he mainly holds down his own but the features he did get are fire. <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/kodakblack/profile">Kodak Black</a> appears on the closing track, aptly titled, "Till Im Gone." Recorded before Kodak's stint in prison, the two rappers hop on a smooth instrumental with a sing-rap delivery. Flipp Dinero reflects on rough times before fame while Kodak details paranoia, incarceration, and spirituality.</p>
      <p><i>Love For Guala</i> also includes appearances from two other New York City natives, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/rich-the-kid/profile">Rich The Kid</a> and Jay Critch, as well as <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lil-baby/profile/">Lil Baby</a>.</p>
      <p><u><b>Quotable Lyrics<br/></b></u>I swear that I'd never tell but I would probably lie, though<br/>They gon' send me back to jail if they know what I know<br/>God'll send me back to hell if he knew what I know</p>
