      <p>MUMBAI: The <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Sharad-Pawar">Sharad Pawar</a> family has always been seen as close-knit. The extended Pawar family from around the world congregates in Baramati every year for Diwali. However, behind the scenes, cracks have been widening over the years.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, after Ajit’s surprise swearingin, Pawar’s daughter Supriya Sule put up a status message on WhatsApp that pointed to these rifts. It said the split was not just in the “party” but in the “family” too.</p>
      <p>The Pawar family has been left embarrassed by a number of public utterances by Ajit, including his snapping at a farmer during a drought, asking whether he should urinate in a dam to produce water.</p>
      <p>Matters came to a head in 2012 when Ajit resigned from the Congress-NCP government in Maharashtra. It later transpired that Ajit was miffed with uncle Sharad Pawar for not putting pressure on the Congress top brass to rein in or shunt out the then <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> CM, Prithviraj Chavan.</p>
      <p>Chavan had put Ajit in a spot by pointing out that in spite of spending hundreds of crores of rupees on irrigation projects, barely 1% of the state had received irrigation. Ajit later rejoined the government. This was the first sign of rebellion by him.</p>
      <p>While Pawar Sr is supposed to have the last word in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/NCP">NCP</a>, Ajit has countered him publicly on many issues. When Sharad alleged that EVMs were tampered with to help the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/BJP">BJP</a>, Ajit said it was just an excuse to hide defeats.</p>
      <p>The tussle between Ajit and Sharad grew during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls when Ajit’s son Parth wanted to contest. Sharad said he should not as too many Pawars were already in the fray. Parth refused to back out, forcing Sharad to withdraw his name from contesting. The young Pawar lost the election.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, Ajit had been talking of displaying saffron flags at NCP events. Sharad Pawar overruled this.</p>
      <p>NCP leaders said Ajit had become anxious due to certain recent developments in the party which, he believes, were meant to cut him to size. With the entry of Rohit Pawar, another grand-nephew of Sharad, who has become an MLA, Ajit believed NCP was trying to create a new power centre to sideline him.</p>
      <p>NCP leaders said after the assembly polls, Ajit asked the party to go with BJP instead of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Shiv-Sena">Shiv Sena</a>. However, this was “disregarded”.</p>
      <p>Those close to Ajit claim the party would rally with him to support BJP and that he would not step back after being sworn in as the deputy CM. Ajit has anyway sent a message that the party could split if it goes ahead with the Sena and the Congress.</p>
