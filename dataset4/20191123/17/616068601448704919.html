      <p>One of Vernon's flashiest Christmas light shows will be brightening up Historic O'Keefe Ranch this year.</p>
      <p>For six years running, the elaborate Christmas show at Voila Hair Studio and Spa attracted a lot of people, which ironically led to its demise.</p>
      <p>The spectacle featured thousands of lights blinking to choreographed music.</p>
      <p>Neighbours of the Pleasant Valley Road business found the attraction brought too much congestion to the area, so Voila owner Suzanne Robert decided 2018 would be the last year for the light show.</p>
      <p>But the show is not gone, it's just been moved.</p>
      <p>On Dec. 1, Historic O'Keefe Ranch presents Mistletoe &amp; Glow, featuring the elaborate light show.</p>
      <p>O'Keefe has expanded the light show and have made it a walk-through event.</p>
      <p>The O'Keefe general store will be open during the inaugural event with all sorts of goodies for sale.</p>
      <p>The tickets for Mistletoe &amp; Glow will be available at the door. Families are $35 (for two adults and up to three children under 18), individuals are $10/adult, $8/ kid under 18, Children under five are free. Mistletoe &amp; Glow runs on Dec. 1, 6-8, 13-15, 20-23, 27-31 from 4-9 p.m.</p>
