      <p>A curfew was imposed in Colombia's capital of Bogotá late on Friday as violent anti-government protests continued for a second day.</p>
      <p>Thousands defied the curfew on Friday while over a quarter of a million people marched in the streets on Thursday across the country to express their anger at proposed labour reforms, the murder of human rights activists and what they see as a government that is unwilling to tackle corruption.</p>
      <p>Authorities said three police were killed in a bomb explosion in the southwest of the country on Friday in the town of Santander de Quilichao in the southwestern province of Cauca, an area considered to be a hotspot for drug trafficking and violence.</p>
      <p>Though most of the protests were peaceful, 98 people were arrested while 122 civilians and 151 officers were injured as of Thursday.</p>
      <p>Colombia's president Iván Duque announced a 9pm curfew across the capital.</p>
      <p>"A few minutes ago, as supreme commander of the military forces and the police, and in coordination with the mayor of Bogotá, Enrique Peñalosa, a curfew was decreed for the localities of Kennedy, Ciudad Bolívar y Bosa starting from 8 p.m. and for the entire capital beginning at 9 p.m," he said.</p>
      <p>The protests have coincided with unrest across Latin America — from anti-austerity marches in Chile, to demonstrations over vote-tampering allegations in Bolivia, as well as tensions in Ecuador, Venezuela and Nicaragua.</p>
