      <p>BRIGHTON (England): Second-half goals from <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ayoze-Perez">Ayoze Perez</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Jamie-Vardy">Jamie Vardy</a> earned Leicester City a convincing 2-0 <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/premier-league">Premier League</a> win over Brighton &amp; Hove Albion at the Amex Stadium on Saturday.</p>
      <p>After failing to score with any of their first 11 attempts on goal, Leicester returned from the halftime break to punish Brighton twice and stay second in the table.</p>
      <p>Perez, whose three previous league goals for Leicester came in a 9-0 rout of Southampton last month, found the net from close range after Vardy broke through on the right flank.</p>
      <p>Vardy slotted home a penalty at the second attempt. The English striker's initial attempt from the spot was saved but <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/James-Maddison">James Maddison</a>'s rebound was chalked off by VAR for encroachment.</p>
      <p>The visitors controlled possession from the kick-off and came close to a breakthrough twice inside five minutes, with Perez hitting the crossbar before Vardy's header forced a diving save from Brighton goalkeeper Mat Ryan.</p>
      <p>It was only after a change of approach from manager <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Brendan-Rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> that Leicester could capitalise on the break and record a seventh win in their last eight league matches.</p>
