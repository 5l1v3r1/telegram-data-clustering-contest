      <p>Dismissing such reports, Kriti said, "Unfortunately, I have left the film. We have mutually decided that I will no longer be a part of that film. Shooting of 'Chehre' was supposed to begin in August-September but then it got pushed to October-November. I already had commitments with 'Housefull 4' and 'Pagalpanti' so unfortunatel, there was nothing that I could do to change my dates."</p>
      <p>The production house, Anand Pandit Motion Pictures, issued a clarification claiming: "In the light of recent media reports, we wish to clarify that @kriti_official and @apmpictures have mutually agreed to part ways on a cordial and professional note. We wish her success in all her future endeavours."</p>
      <p>The statement was issued on the banner's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Twitter">Twitter</a> account.</p>
