      <h3>Crystal Palace 1-2 Liverpool</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a>, Selhurst Park<br/>November 23, 2019</p>
      <p><b>Goals:</b> Zaha 82′; Mane 49′, Firmino 85′</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The Reds made the trip to Selhurst Park as the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> made its return after international action.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a> made one change from the side who beat <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/man-city">Man City</a> as <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/mohamed-salah/">Mohamed Salah</a> dropped to the bench with <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alex-oxlade-chamberlain/">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> taking his place.</p>
      <p>The Reds were off the pace in the opening term and failed to test Palace where it mattered most and their sluggishness almost came at a price with James Tomkins finding the back of the net, only for VAR to intervene for a foul on <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/dejan-lovren/">Dejan Lovren</a> in the build-up.</p>
      <p>A timely wake-up call for the Reds on the cusp of half-time.</p>

      <p>And it had its required effect as Liverpool emerged from the interval with renewed intent and after missing his first opening, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/sadio-mane/">Sadio Mane</a> did not have long to wait to make amends as his scuffed shot from inside the area nestled into the back of the net.</p>
      <p>Klopp’s side had a plethora of chances to put the result beyond doubt, but Palace struck next through Wilfried Zaha to leave the Reds eight minutes to find a response.</p>
      <p>They need only three, however, as <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/roberto-firmino/">Roberto Firmino</a> capitalised on a scramble in the Eagles’ six-yard box to fire Liverpool back into the lead, where they would remain come the final whistle.</p>
      <p>The result ensures Liverpool remain eight points clear at the top after 13 <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> games.</p>
      <p>Liverpool’s congested schedule has now kicked off, where the next challenge comes in the form of Napoli in the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/champions-league">Champions League</a>, where a win at Anfield would see the Reds progress to the last 16.</p>
