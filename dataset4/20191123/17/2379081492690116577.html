      <p>(Bloomberg) — Walt Disney Co. said “Frozen II,” the sequel to the 2013 film that became the top-grossing animated picture of all time, posted an estimated $41.8 million for its domestic opening day and $57.8 million in international debuts.</p>
      <p>The movie’s opening is the highest for Disney Animation-Pixar in China and Poland and the No. 1 Disney Animation debut in the U.K. Early estimates from its second day in China point to a further $24 million.</p>
      <p>Prior to the release, Disney said it expected the movie to generate opening-weekend sales of about $100 million in the U.S. and Canada. Outside forecasters see more, with Exhibitor Relations projecting $113 million and Box Office Pro at $130 million.</p>
      <p>“Disney’s much anticipated “Frozen II” animated sequel could kick-start a box-office recovery with a blistering $130 million weekend opening. The movie will breathe life into an industry where year-to-date receipts are down 7.5%.”</p>
