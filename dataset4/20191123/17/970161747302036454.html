      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a>’s decision to replace <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> could force the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> board to sack Unai Emery, according to Tony Adams.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard was effectively given a vote of confidence during the international break after Arsenal lost 2-0 at Leicester earlier this month and his team delivered another disjointed performance against struggling Southampton on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Alexandre Lacazette rescued a 2-2 draw in injury time against a side struggling at the bottom of the table, while Emery was subjected to a torrent of abuse and cries of ‘your’re getting sacked in the morning’ from his own fans.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, across London, Spurs recorded their first away win in the league since last December in what was Mourinho’s first match in charge and Adams believes Daniel Levy’s decision to act with such ruthlessness heaps the pressure on Arsenal’s board.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘What’s happened over the other side of north London has put huge pressure on this guy, they’ve made a significant change.</p>

      <p>‘This is a really poor performance. Absoutely, the fans are not going to be happy with this</p>
      <p>‘I don’t want anybody to go because I do think there’s been a huge problem with recruitment at the club for lots of years.</p>
      <p>‘But he’s not getting the best out of this group of players. They are literally all over the place and they’re going backwards.</p>
      <p>Asked whether Pochettino would be a suitable replacement for the beleagured Emery, Adams added: ‘I’m not sure he’s the right manager.</p>
      <p>‘I wouldn’t want him at this club I think the Tottenham connection and there might be other people out there.</p>
      <p>‘Someone who can do the defensive side of the game would be a start.’</p>
