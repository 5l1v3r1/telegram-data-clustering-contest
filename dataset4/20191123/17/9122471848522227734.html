      <h1>Video: Tua Tagovailoa Arrives At Bryant-Denny Stadium</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:38:47+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Not even a season-ending injury can keep Tua Tagovailoa away from Tuscaloosa. He obviously won’t be playing again this season, but the star signal-caller is in attendance for Alabama’s final home game of the year.</p>
      <p>The Crimson Tide remain in the mix for a spot in the College Football Playoff. Nick Saban’s team needs to make a statement over the next two weeks to convince the selection committee that it’s worthy of being in the postseason.</p>
      <p>A win over Western Carolina probably won’t do the trick, yet Alabama does have a tough test next Saturday against Auburn. Defeating the Tigers on the road without Tagovailoa would be quite impressive.</p>
      <p>While the Crimson Tide will eventually have to worry about facing the Tigers, they’re currently enjoying their senior day.</p>
      <p>Before kickoff at the stadium, Tagovailoa was brought in on a medical cart. After all, he did undergo surgery a few days ago.</p>
      <p>Here’s footage of Tagovailoa making his entrance at Bryant-Denny Stadium this afternoon:</p>

      <p>Shortly after Tagovailoa made his way to the sidelines, the crowd gave him a standing ovation.</p>
      <p>Alabama will obviously miss having Tagovailoa under center for the rest of the season, but backup quarterback Mac Jones is performing well against Western Carolina this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Fans can watch the Crimson Tide on ESPN.</p>
