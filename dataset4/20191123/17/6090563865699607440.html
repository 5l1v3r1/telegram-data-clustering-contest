      <p>Eight people died while two others sustained minor injuries last night when a commuter omnibus heading to Kanyemba from Harare collided with a lorry and burst into flames in Concession, Mazowe District.</p>
      <p>The eight included the driver of the commuter omnibus. Oshia Njenge (22) was the only survivor when the commuter omnibus rammed into a Toyota Dyna truck. The 22-year-old survivor recounted the moments leading up to the horrific crash.</p>
      <p>“Ndirikungonzwa kurwadziwa nekurasikirwa kwakaitwa vanhu nehupenyu (I am hurt by the way people perished in the accident),” said Njenge.</p>
      <p>Eyewitnesses interviewed at the scene said they were unable to help after flammable substances in the commuter omnibus fueled the fire.</p>
      <p>Mashonaland Central Acting Provincial Development Coordinator, Cosmas Chiringa confirmed the incident.</p>
      <p>He appealed to public service vehicles to desist from carrying flammable substances on board.</p>
      <p>The injured were treated and discharged while 7 of the deceased have been identified after the bodies were taken to Concession Hospital Mortuary. Names are being withheld until their next of kin have been informed. One body is yet to be identified.</p>
