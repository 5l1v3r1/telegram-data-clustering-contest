      <h1>Arsenal vs Southampton player ratings: What’s the point?</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal welcomed Southampton to the Emirates looking for something conclusive. They didn’t find it. This was awful. Here are the player ratings.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:06:08+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://paininthearsenal.com/author/joshsippie/" target="_blank">Josh Sippie</a></address>
      <p>International break came to a close and with it, another gap in time when people were able to scrounge together some optimism and believe that <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/category/arsenal-news/">Arsenal</a> would have been able to regroup and make a real go at some kind of consistency.</p>
      <p>The only thing in the way was Southampton, the worst defense in the league, and Unai Emery was clearly sticking to the plan of playing his best possible players. As well as his highest paid ones.</p>
      <p>Going into the match, Tottenham had already secured their first win under Jose Mourinho, which moved them ahead of the Gunners on points, so the matter at hand—taking three points—was of the utmost importance. As it always was.</p>

      <p>It started in typical Arsenal fashion. A questionable foul against <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/dc6f5bdd/Calum-Chambers?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Calum Chambers</a> led to the Gunners turning off and complaining. Rather than stay tuned in, they switch off an argue and Southampton strike quick and score. It was truly remarkable how they all shut off in unison. And pathetic.</p>
      <p>It didn’t get much better. A brief spell at 1-1 gave way to a 2-1 defeat that is well and truly unbelievable. I now that nothing should be surprising anymore, but the level of capitulation here is just incredible.</p>
      <p>Here are the player ratings from the match.</p>
      <h3>Goalkeeper</h3>
      <details>
        <summary>BERND LENO - GK,Arsenal</summary>
        <h4>6.9</h4>
        <p>He finally saves a penalty and it gets put in on the rebound. Otherwise quite a strong match from Leno, all things considered.</p>
