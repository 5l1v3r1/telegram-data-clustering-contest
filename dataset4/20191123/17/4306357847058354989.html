      <h3>Gary Lineker has taken to social media to label Arsenal’s performance as “dreadful” after they slumped to a 2-2 draw with Southampton in the Premier League on Saturday.</h3>
      <p>The Gunners headed into the game under pressure to find a win after their 2-0 loss to Leicester City last time out.</p>
      <p>Unai Emery’s side had only won one of their previous five Premier League games heading into the home clash against the Saints on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Danny Ings gave the visitors a surprise lead in the eighth minute, but Alexandre Lacazette levelled for Emery’s men in the 18th minute.</p>
      <p>James Ward-Prowse thought he had won it for the Saints when he netted in the 71st minute to put the visitors in front once again.</p>
      <p>Arsenal looked to be heading to another Premier League defeat, but Lacazette netted a last-gasp equaliser in the sixth minute of stoppage time to salvage a point for the home side.</p>
      <p>England legend Lineker was clearly not impressed by Arsenal’s performance overall as he reacted to Lacazette’s second goal on social media.</p>
      <p>Writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/1198284366021046272">Twitter</a>, Lineker said: “Lacazette grabs a last ditch equaliser for Arsenal after what was frankly a dreadful display against a very good Southampton side.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal’s draw left them in seventh place in the Premier League table and well off the pace in the race for the top four.</p>
      <p>Emery’s side have only managed to win four of their opening 13 Premier League games under the Spanish head coach this season.</p>
      <p>They will return to Premier League action next weekend with a trip to Norwich City.</p>
