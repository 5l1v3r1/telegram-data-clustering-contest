      <p>The second teaser of Venky Mama is out. This time it concentrates on “Alludu” as its <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/movienews/the-world-of-nc19-showcasing-naga-chaitanya-middle-class-world/">Naga Chaitanya</a>’s birthday today.</p>
      <p>The fun aspect is once again visible. We have another love story, and that comes from ‘Alludu’ Naga Chaitanya. Glimpses of his track with Rashi Khanna is lovely but typical of the commercial romantic dramas the star usually does. The addition of Venkatesh in the routine become variety here. Of course, it was the case on the opposite end as well, with Venkatesh and his love story.</p>
