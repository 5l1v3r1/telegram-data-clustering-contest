      <h1>On show at last: Eric Tucker, the Secret Lowry of Warrington</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-reporters/" target="_blank">Telegraph Reporters</a></address>
      <p>Artist Eric Tucker was so secretive about his talent, his paintings were <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/10111183/LS-Lowry-theres-more-to-him-than-matchstick-men.html">never seen by the public during his lifetime.</a></p>
      <p>Now artwork left by the man known as "the secret Lowry" is being exhibited in a gallery for the first time.</p>
      <p>The unskilled labourer made 400 oil and watercolour paintings and thousands of sketches in the front parlour of his terraced house in Warrington over six decades. </p>
      <p>But his legacy of art, which depicts the pubs and streets of north-west England, was only discovered after he died aged 86 in July last year. </p>
      <p>Tucker's work attracted comparisons with LS Lowry and was hailed as an important discovery for British art after it was found by his family.</p>

      <p>His dream of having a gallery exhibition in his home town has now been fulfilled, as Warrington Museum &amp; Art Gallery stages a retrospective called Eric Tucker: The Unseen Artist. </p>
      <p>It features 70 of his paintings and a recreation of the parlour he used as an art studio in the home he shared with his mother. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/10119463/LS-Lowry-The-unseen-drawings.html">Before the new exhibition,</a> only one of his paintings had been put on display, after winning a local competition.</p>
      <p>Tony Tucker, Eric's brother, told the BBC: "I'm very proud for him... He would have loved it. I'm sorry he's not there [to see it]."</p>
      <p>Tucker, who was a professional boxer in the 1950s, had been known to paint in his spare time, but his family had no idea he was so prolific.</p>

      <p>Tony said he only got a sense of how many paintings his brother had created shortly before his death. </p>
      <p>"I found his paintings in the bedrooms, in the loft, in the store room, even in the garden shed they were stacked," he added.</p>
      <p>"Even I hadn't realised how much work he'd produced. So that was quite a shock to me."</p>
      <p>Many of Tucker's paintings feature characters from a bygone era drinking, smoking and wearing flat caps in traditional pubs. </p>
      <p>He once went to a pub quiz and surreptitiously sketched some drinkers on the back of his answer sheet, the exhibition's curator Janice Hayes said.</p>

      <p>"There's one that I particularly like where he's obviously in a pub doing a pub quiz, but on the back [of the quiz sheet] he's sketched a couple of the people he was sitting next to," she explained.</p>
      <p>"We knew that Eric had expressed to Tony that he would have liked an exhibition in his home town, so it's nice to feel that we're able to honour that last wish."</p>
      <p>Art critic Ruth Millington, who wrote the exhibition catalogue, says Tucker painted "with authenticity and a sophisticated innocence", capturing "the psychological dramas of ordinary, working-class people".</p>
      <p>She hailed the discovery of his works as "a significant contribution to modern British art".</p>
      <p>More than 2,000 people went to see a display of Tucker's art staged inside his house following his death last year, but this is the first time it has been exhibited in a gallery.</p>
      <p>Eric Tucker: The Unseen Artist opened on Saturday and will run until February 23. </p>
