      <h1>Ironing boards, chocolate ants and empty boxes: ECHO readers tell us the worst Christmas presents they have ever received</h1>
      <h2>Before you start wrapping gifts, just check you haven't got someone any of these</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:26:27+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/rebecca-koncienzcy/" target="_blank">Rebecca Koncienzcy</a></address>
      <p>There is not long to go until <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> morning when we will all be ripping open gifts under the tree.</p>
      <p>And we all know we should always be grateful for whatever we receive, as we are privileged to even have presents.</p>
      <p>But that doesn't stop us feeling a little disappointed when opening something that doesn't quite make the grade.</p>
      <p>From remote controls and toilet seats to chocolate covered ants, many of the previous gifts our <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO readers</a> have been met with everything from confusion to upset.</p>
      <p>So before you head out to the shops, maybe make sure none of these are on your lists - unless they someone specifically asked for a box of empty handkerchiefs, of course.</p>
      <h3>The practical gifts</h3>
      <p>Some people can just be so hard to buy for. While most just go with chocolates or smellies, it seems some take the more practical route with classics like... an ironing board.</p>
      <p>We can only imagine the pretend faces of joy people have had to pull when receiving some of these.</p>
      <p>One unlucky Twitter user @JaneIthell said they got a toilet seat from their uncle one year, but have also been given an ironing board cover in the past.</p>

      <p>Reader Emma Mcmahon is now the proud owner of a Sky box remote control while Helen Tindall got a box of tea bags from her elderly aunt.</p>
      <p>Jeanette Blackhurst's husband once bought her a tool box and the following year a set of pans from Argos.</p>
      <p>Diane Blair got a vegetable steamer from her now ex-husband, but reassures us that is not the reason she divorced him.</p>
      <h3>Not-so-practical gifts</h3>
      <p>Donna Morris's husband was given a comb, which seems harsh given that he is bald.</p>
      <p>Ann Spencer opened up her gift to find three bottles of wine, a fine gift for some, but she said: "l have been tee total all my life."</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Jarvis was confused with her gift of a microwaveable hot water bottle: "I didn't own a microwave."</p>
      <h3>The re-gifted freebies</h3>
      <p>Perhaps we have all been guilty of regifting something - you could even argue it is better for the environment.</p>
      <p>But not everyone's been so impressed with re-gifted items that have been passed on the following Christmas.</p>
      <p>Becky Moore said she got a bright yellow crook lock for her car: "That my husband was given free by the police outside ASDA one day! Even went to the effort of wrapping it up for me."</p>

      <p>Louise Doherty said she got some really nice cosmetics but said: "Then I saw the sticker on it ‘not for resale’ meaning they were obviously an unwanted freebie."</p>
      <p>Donna Smith said she got a dressing gown, which seems fair, but added: "[It] had an inhaler in the pocket .. The person who gave me it hadn’t long come out of hospital."</p>
      <p>Sue Dunnett said she got back a handbag that she had given the person the previous year: "But with a half eaten bag of crisps as an added bonus."</p>
      <h3>The straight to bin prezzies</h3>
      <p>Some gift are so bad they just end up in the bin with the wrapping.</p>
      <p>San Saunderson said she got a diamente encrusted keyring: "With half the stones missing... clearly an afterthought. Straight in the bin!!!"</p>
      <p>Dianne Cook's worst present took a bit of a detour before it was finally binned. After receiving a duck shaped basket with a soap in, she gave it back the next year to the person who gave it to her (her nan).</p>
      <p>She said: "I received it back the next year! It then was laid to rest in the bin!!"</p>
      <p>Julie Crowder got a picture frame, a bog-standard gift, if a little uninspired, but she said: "With no glass or back, and it had some, what looked like tomato ketchup on the frame. Am hoping that's what it was anyway needless to say it went on the fire!"</p>
      <h3>And the downright weird</h3>
      <p>Then there are the gifts that have just baffled us.</p>
      <p>Danielle Zara Tanner told us she received a gecko, which wasn't on her Christmas list.    </p>
      <p>She said: "I don't like lizards and at the time I had two cats and a young child! They live 15 years, I just couldn't commit to that!"</p>

      <p>It seems someone in Pauline Green's office was trying to spice things up in the Christmas party's secret Santa.</p>
      <p>She said: "I picked out a wrapped up box of candy undies! The next year I wrapped them and put them back into the secret Santa as still in date.</p>
      <p>"The person who pulled them out was the one that put them in there the year before!!"</p>
      <p>Twitter user @abirkett63 said they received a gobstopper, just one, and not an everlasting one, they added: "It deffo didn’t shut me up, take more than that!"</p>
      <p>Craig Dillon said he was given a kid's toy farm. Seems fair? He was 22-years-old at the time.</p>
      <p>Twitter user @DaveTurbo opened up chocolates one Christmas, but they were chocolate covered ants. He said: "They were foul."</p>
      <p>Alison Robinson must have felt like she was on the 'naughty list' when she got a green box: "With nothing in it."</p>
      <p>And she wasn't the only one getting empty boxes, Twitter @ManningMr received an empty box of handkerchiefs.</p>
      <p>There were also a number of people who made the joke about getting a subscription to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">the ECHO</a> , but we think that is a great gift idea for a friend or family member, and you can sign up by calling 0151 472 2344.</p>
