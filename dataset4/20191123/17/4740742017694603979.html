      <h1>'Terrific display' - Bristol City player ratings after bore draw against Nottingham Forest</h1>
      <h2>Our Robins writer's view from Ashton Gate</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:04:48+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:04</time> by <a rel="author">Gregor MacGregor</a></address>
      <h3>Dan Bentley - 7</h3>
      <p>Several routine saves as the former Bee defended his goal stoutly. Almost lobbed by Grabban late on but nothing he could do about that. Another clean sheet.</p>
      <h3>Pedro Pereira - 8</h3>
      <p>The Portuguese full-back ran up and down the right flank all day, shepherding the ball out from an Ameobi run down the flank and sending over a barrage of crosses, perhaps the best picking out Palmer on 80 minutes. Terrific display.</p>
      <h3>Ashley Williams - 7</h3>
      <p>One brilliant dummy bringing the ball out of defence to go among the customary interceptions and tackles. Terrific tackle on Lolley on 79 minutes to deny the winger - that foot came from nowhere.</p>

      <h3>Nathan Baker - 6</h3>
      <p>Couple of under-hit passes from the centre-back left the hosts in trouble. Grabban almost made the most of his mistake on 74 minutes to lob Bentley. His 100th league appearance for the club.</p>
      <h3>Bailey Wright - 7</h3>
      <p>Terrific block early on as Lolley attacked the City goal and then smashed by Ameobi from behind. Put in a decent cross in the second half to dolly up one for Diedhiou. Taken off after 64 minutes.</p>
      <h3>Tommy Rowe - 6</h3>
      <p>Battled hard on the left combining nicely with O'Dowda to set the Irishman in on goal. Headed over as Brownhill cross on 79 minutes to waste a great opportunity.</p>
      <h3>Josh Brownhill - 6</h3>
      <p>Handed the captaincy over to Wright and showed nimble footwork in the middle chasing the diminutive Silva and bypassing Watson's tackles. Wasn't at his best as his crosses went wide of their targets late on.</p>
      <h3>Adam Nagy - 6</h3>
      <p>Prompted play through the middle but almost dangerously lost the ball to let Forest counter. Yates flew into him with two feet to get a red card. Looked tired towards the end of the game.</p>

      <h3>Callum O'Dowda - 6</h3>
      <p>Chance to shoot on the 30 minute mark but opted to cross to Weimann when six yards out on his left foot. Good run down the left on 40 minutes to gain a corner. Added good energy, but subbed off after an hour for Palmer.</p>
      <h3>Andi Weimann - 6</h3>
      <p>Had the only shot on goal in the first half but hit the post in the second period after Pereira slotted him down the right channel. Cross-shot hit the post as he went close in the second half. Withdrawn for Rodri late on.</p>
      <h3>Famara Diedhiou - 7</h3>
      <p>Brilliant goal-line clearance in the first half to deny Yates. And did well holding the ball up at times too. Sadly, few quality crosses for the no.9 to attack.</p>
      <h3>Substitutes</h3>
      <h3>Niclas Eliasson (for Wright, 65) - 7</h3>
      <p>Came on at 64 minutes and two minutes later showed what he offers with a delicious arcing cross. Why not started?</p>
      <h3>Kasey Palmer (for O'Dowda, 65) - 6</h3>
      <p>Got the final half an hour and almost put Rodri in on goal late on.</p>
      <h3>Rodri (for Weiman, 76) - n/a</h3>
      <p>Got the final minutes and almost hit an overhead winner. Alas, blasted over the bar.</p>
