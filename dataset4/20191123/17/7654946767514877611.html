      <h1>Baylor vs. Texas prediction, line: Underdog Longhorns will cover</h1>

      <p>What do you call it when a team is rolling along with a perfect season and then loses for the first time?</p>
      <p>On VSiN’s “Opening Lines Show” on Sunday night, professional bettor Dan Staley talked about fading teams “after a dream-killer game.”</p>
      <p>But whatever they’re called, the play is to go against teams after they’ve lost a big game that pretty much busts their hopes and dreams.</p>
      <p>Baylor certainly is such a team. The Bears were 9-0 and up to No. 13 in the College Football Playoff rankings heading into their home game against Oklahoma last Saturday. Baylor bolted to a 31-10 halftime lead only to have the Sooners mount an epic comeback with 24 unanswered points in the second half for a 34-31 win. Losing a game like that would normally take a lot of a team anyway, but now add in the fact the Bears’ dreams of running the table and getting in the CFP are squashed and we have to fade them as they’re now 6-point favorites versus Texas.</p>
      <p>The Longhorns haven’t lived up to expectations this year (6-4 straight up, 5-5 against the spread) mostly because of a defense allowing nearly 30 points per game. However, they’ve been competitive in just about every game, losing just 34-27 to Oklahoma (similar to Baylor’s result) and 23-21 to Iowa State, which Baylor beat 23-21. So, these teams aren’t that much different talent-wise, and an argument can be made the Longhorns would have been favored before the season with the current line reflecting how much Baylor has overachieved versus how much Texas has underachieved.</p>
      <p>Texas QB Sam Ehlinger (65 percent completion percentage, 2,914 yards, 27 touchdowns, just eight interceptions) should keep the Longhorns in this game until the end, if not pull out the outright upset.</p>
      <p><b>The play:</b> Texas +5 ¹/₂.</p>
      <p>Unlike last Saturday, when we only liked Wyoming +5.5 (and cashed) versus Utah State, here are two bonus plays:</p>
      <p><b>Kansas State (+2.5) at Texas Tech:</b> Staying in the Big 12, I think we have a game with the wrong team favored. Actually, Circa Sports in Las Vegas opened Texas Tech -1 last Sunday and the first bets moved K-State to 1-point favoritism. Several offshore and Vegas books opened the Wildcats as short road chalk, but it has been back to Texas Tech as the favorite, and I don’t think that’s the right move. They’ve pretty much split their games against common opponents and have similar ATS marks with KSU at 7-3 and Tech at 6-3-1, but the Wildcats have the significantly better defense and I trust dual-threat QB Skylar Thompson more to pull out a close game.</p>
      <p><b>Tennessee (+3.5) at Missouri:</b> Both these SEC teams are 5-5 and playing for bowl eligibility, but these are two programs heading in opposite directions. Tennessee has won three straight games (and four covers in a row) while Missouri has lost four straight (with five straight non-covers). Both teams understandably lost to Georgia and Florida while beating South Carolina, but Tennessee is coming off a 17-13 win at Kentucky while Missouri was blown out 29-7 on the road by the Wildcats. I’m not sure why the Volunteers are getting more than a field goal, but I’ll take the bonus points.</p>
