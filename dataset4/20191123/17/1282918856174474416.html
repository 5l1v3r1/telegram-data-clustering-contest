      <h3>I don't care about trolls and criticism: Nargis Fakhri</h3>
      <p>She was recently trolled for her weight gain but actress Nargis Fakhri says she does not let online vitriol affect her. The actor, who revealed that she had gained 40 pounds, says she likes to stay away from the limelight when she is not working. "I don't care or give a damn about criticism. We are too much in limelight. So, during my downtime I like to be relaxed and not focus on these things. If someone thinks that I will get busted with trolls or criticism... Sorry, but it is not going to happen," Nargis told PTI. The 37-year-old actor says she is fine with fewer but interesting films. "I like being in an incognito mode until I have an opportunity to be back with a bang."</p>
