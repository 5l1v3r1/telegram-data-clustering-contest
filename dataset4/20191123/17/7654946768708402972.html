      <p>A crazed creep tried to snatch a 10-month-old girl from a stroller as her mother walked down a Queens street, police said Saturday.</p>
      <p>The woman was pushing the tot in a stroller near 43rd Ave. and 11th St. in Corona Park at about 10:30 p.m. Thursday when the deranged man ran up to her and grabbed the stroller, authorities said.</p>
      <p>“Give me the baby!” the stranger screamed repeatedly at the mother as they wrestled for the infant.</p>
      <p>The mom fought off the attacker, who ran off, police said.</p>
      <p>Investigators believe the man was drunk when he demanded she hand over the child.</p>
      <p>Images released by police show the would-be kidnapper dining at a nearby Roosevelt Ave restaurant just after the incident.</p>
      <p>He is described as in his 20s, approximately 5-foot-5, with brown eyes and black hair, and was last seen wearing a green hooded sweatshirt and dark pants, authorities said.</p>
