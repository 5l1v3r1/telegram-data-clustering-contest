      <p>Sean Dyche joked about how former Watford chairman Sir Elton John used to message him, back when the Burnley manager was in charge at Vicarage Road - but might not do after this result.</p>
      <p>Quique Sanchez Flores, currently in charge of Watford, should be far more worried about his phone buzzing and an awkward conversation with a member of the club’s hierarchy. </p>
      <p>The pressure on Flores looked to have eased after their previous game - a win at Norwich - but this result has turned the heat back on in terms of the relegation battle.</p>
      <p>Beleaguered Watford have now been condemned to 11 consecutive home league games without winning - for the first time in their history - and have slumped back to bottom place.</p>
      <p>Dyche’s Burnley finally ended their winless away start to the Premier League season with second-half goals from Chris Wood, Ashley Barnes and James Tarkowski.</p>

      <p>Flores said: “After beating Norwich, we didn’t think everything was fixed. But, after defeat here, we don't think every thing is wrong.</p>
      <p>“Football is unpredictable - Norwich lost 2-0 to us then beat Everton 2-0. </p>
      <p>“I don't have doubts in the players. But, I knew from the first day, it would be difficult. It is difficult to change things so quick.”</p>
      <p>Burnley had lost 3-0 themselves at Sheffield United three weeks ago - but have followed that up with successive 3-0 wins, here and at home against West Ham, and are now sixth. </p>
      <p>Dyche’s men managed their first away league clean sheet since January - when they did it at Watford.</p>
      <p>The first period had actually been dominated by Watford but their lack of killer instinct is a major factor in why they are last. In contrast, Burnley kept it tight then broke their opponents clinically. </p>
      <p>Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope - a week after playing 90 minutes for England - made saves to deny Gerard Deulofeu.</p>
      <p>The visitors scored from their first shot on target when Wood hooked the ball in, inside the six-yard box.</p>
      <p>Jay Rodriguez struck the bar for Burnley, then the killer blow then arrived when VAR awarded a penalty to Barnes - judging he was caught by Jose Holebas - and the striker struck in. </p>
      <p>Tarkowski then scored at the second attempt after being initially denied by Ben Foster. Deulofeu struck against the bar but, by then, his side had been buried.</p>
      <p>Dyche said: “It wasn’t a 3-0 performance but you take the 3-0.”</p>
