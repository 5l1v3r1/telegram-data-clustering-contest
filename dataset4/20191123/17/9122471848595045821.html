      <h1>Photo Shows How Many Letters Tua Received From Alabama Fans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:14:50+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Tua Tagovailoa has been extremely upbeat throughout his early recovery process from his season-ending hip injury. Video showed the Alabama quarterback <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/photo-alabama-players-visit-tua-tagovailoa-in-the-hospital">in a good mood at the hospital</a> and he’s since returned to the Crimson Tide, interacting <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/alabama-shares-heartwarming-video-tua-tagovailoa-game">with his teammates and Nick Saban</a>.</p>
      <p>The star quarterback likely won’t play for Alabama again, as he’ll probably declare for the 2020 NFL Draft, where he’s expected to be a high pick.</p>
      <p>The love Alabama fans have for their QB isn’t going away, though.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa shared a photo on Instagram of the amount of letters he’s received from fans since his injury. It’s a lot.</p>

      <p>Notice how Tagovailoa said that was just the “first wave” of letters he’s received from Alabama fans. His mailbox probably looks like Harry Potter’s at the beginning of <i>Sorcerer’s Stone</i>.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa is expected to make a full recovery from his hip injury. He could reportedly be back on the field in six to eight months.</p>
      <p>Alabama, meanwhile, is hosting Western Carolina today.</p>
