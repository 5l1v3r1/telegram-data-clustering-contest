      <p>Boro had the better of the chances in the first half but neither side were able to create any clear-cut opportunities in a less than entertaining 45 minutes.</p>
      <p>In the second period, Walsall looked much more threatening and looked the most likely team to score.</p>
      <p>Danny Guthrie curled a free-kick towards goal in injury time, but saw it come crashing off the bar as the teams shared the points.</p>
      <p>Darrell Clarke made three changes to the side that beat Darlington in an FA Cup replay in midweek, starting in a 4-4-2 formation.</p>
      <p>Shay Facey returned to the team, replacing Cameron Norman, while Alfie Bates also came in for Gary Liddle, who didn’t make the squad.</p>
      <p>Dan Scarr also returned to league duty after serving his suspension against Cambridge, with Mat Sadler moving to the bench.</p>
      <p>Zak Jules didn’t make the squad, but Guthrie was named among the substitutes after his return from injury.</p>
      <p>The clash in the Black Country was Stevenage caretaker manager Mark Sampson’s first game since he was charged by the FA for alleged racist comments.</p>
      <p>His side started in a 4-3-3 formation with veteran striker Craig Mackail-Smith leading the line.</p>
      <p>In contrast to the Saddlers’ last league outing, where Josh Gordon scored within a minute, it was a much quieter opening to the game against Stevenage.</p>
      <p>Neither side fashioned a chance in the opening 10 minutes as Walsall looked to get hold of the ball and introduce their attacking talents.</p>
      <p>Shortly after, however, the visitors created the first opening. Elliot List did well down the left wing and his cross was met by Jason Cowley, whose diving header hit the side netting.</p>
      <p>Charlie Carter then went close himself when he was found on the right. He raced towards the byline and cut a shot at the near post, which was held by Roberts.</p>
      <p>Just after 20 minutes Walsall created an opportunity themselves, through more good work from Gordon. The striker muscled his way in and crossed for Lavery who set up McDonald for a shot in the box, which was blocked.</p>
      <p>Liam Kinsella’s follow-up was then also blocked.</p>
      <p>After a solid start to the game, Stevenage defender Ben Nugent was forced off with an injury after 25 minutes, being replaced by Paul Digby.</p>
      <p>James Clarke then defended superbly to stop a certain Stevenage goal, rising the highest at the back post to head the ball clear, with an attacking waiting to turn the ball home.</p>
      <p>Dan Scarr’s header, from a Rory Holden corner, sailed just past the post in the 38th minute.</p>
      <p>After five minutes of added time both sides went into half-time with the score at 0-0.</p>
      <p>As the teams emerged for the second half, Darrell Clarke made two substitutions, bringing on Guthrie and James Hardy for Kinsella and McDonald.</p>
      <p>The changes seemed to work early on as Walsall came out with a point to prove. Guthrie began to dictate play when he got onto the ball and worked it out wide into some dangerous areas - although they didn’t create anything meaningful in the opening minutes.</p>
      <p>Just after an hour, the home fans thought Holden had scored the breakthrough goal for Walsall. He met Gordon’s cross and his header was about to nestle into the top corner before Paul Farman pulled off an excellent save to tip it over the bar.</p>
      <p>The minutes following that chance saw the Saddlers dominate, but fail to take their chances.</p>
      <p>It was roles reversed from Holden’s chance in the 70th minute when this time the midfielder crossed for Gordon - who put his header just over the bar.</p>
      <p>Scarr then went close himself with a header from a corner, which was also saved.</p>
      <p>Elijah Adebayo, who came on for Holden in the 75th minute, created an excellent chance minutes after his introduction. He brought down a high ball superbly and after cutting in, his shot was blocked from close range.</p>
      <p>Despite being on top Walsall almost conceded with 84 minutes gone. A Stevenage header caused a scramble in the box and Scarr was on hand to clear the ball off the line.</p>
      <p>In the 92nd minute, after winning a free-kick, Guthrie stepped up to curl the effort that came crashing back off the bar.</p>
      <p>And it proved to be the last action of the half as both teams earned a point.</p>
