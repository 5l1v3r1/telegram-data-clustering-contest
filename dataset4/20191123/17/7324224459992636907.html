      <p>If you're dog is well behaved, small, used to being around people and quiet then award-winning director and producer Ellen Kent wants to hear from you.</p>
      <p>Ms Kent is directing opera La Boheme at the Grand Theatre in Wolverhampton on January 26.</p>
      <p>She said: "People say never work with children or animals, but I love to do both. The first time was 20 years ago when my pet cat Holly Go-Lightly was in one of my productions and was an instant hit.</p>
      <p>"Since then, we’ve had horses, dogs, goldfish and even a golden eagle with a 6ft wingspan on stage. Many years ago, when we last did La Boheme and asked local people to volunteer their pets it was a huge success.</p>
      <p>"We even used a rescue dog once and found him dozens of new owners. We’re a nation of animal lovers after all. I’m sure there is plenty of doggie talent out there."</p>
      <p>Puccini's opera is based on Henri Murger’s novel Scenes de la vie de Boheme and focuses on the tragic love between seamstress Mimi and penniless poet Rodolfo.</p>
      <p>Anyone wishing to audition their dog should send a photograph to Angela Klappa by email to angela@ellenkent.co.uk.</p>
      <p>Please include a contact number and address as well as the breed, height, weight, age and name of the dog.</p>
