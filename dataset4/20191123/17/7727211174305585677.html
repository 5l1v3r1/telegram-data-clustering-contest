      <h2>Distressed mum Rebecca said "they don't care if they kill someone"</h2>

      <p>Yobs hurled a rock at a car carrying a mum and her 11-month-old baby before laughing at the terrifying near miss.</p>
      <p>Rebecca Leyland was driving along Vyner Road North, in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/birkenhead">Birkenhead</a> , when she claims a rock was hurled at her car earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The mum fears the rock was thrown by children standing on a bridge over the busy road, while her four-year-old son was also in the car.</p>
      <p>Rebecca, from Bidston, said she heard laughter as her 11-month-old daughter was inches way from being hit by the falling rock.</p>

      <p>Her young son is now too frightened to drive down the road and she is now forced to use an alternative route.</p>
      <p>She told <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">the ECHO:</a> “I was driving [back] from dropping my older boys off in Woodchurch, so I was driving towards Hoylake Road.</p>
      <p>“When going under the bridge, a huge thud of a rock hit my window screen. I thought it was a rock that had fallen from the top of the cliff part, or I had hit something.</p>
      <p>“I turned around and went back to check it out, and that’s when I saw a few boys, around 14 or 15, at the top of the cliff all hooded up so you can’t see them.</p>
      <p>“I shouted stop it, they are going to kill someone and I have a baby in the car who was directly under where the stone it.</p>
      <p>“The reply I got was them laughing and throwing a larger rock.”</p>

      <p>She added: “As I was on the phone to police they were throwing more at my car. Nobody was hurt thankfully, but my son who is now four is too scared to go that way.”</p>
      <p>Rebecca later reported the incident to police.</p>
      <p>However, it is not the only time drivers have been targeted by yobs throwing things from the same bridge.</p>
      <p>Another driver, a woman who has asked not to be named, said her windscreen "smashed into pieces” after her car was struck on November 10 while she was driving in the dark.</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old said she has driven down the road plenty of times before, but after her journey, at about 6pm, she returned home in tears.</p>
      <p>After the “brick-sized rock” hit her windscreen from above, adding: “I could hear people laughing and cheering.</p>
      <p>“They were saying ‘we’ve got her, we’ve got her’. They thought it was hilarious.”</p>
      <p>As the car was pelted, the driver said she swerved off the road into bushes. She said it’s fortunate there was no one else on the road at the time.</p>
      <p>She said: “It could have killed someone, no doubt about it.”</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old said: “I have not got a clue why you would want to do that? What in the world would make you think that was a fun thing to do? It’s just malicious.”</p>
      <p>She escaped the incident with just a few cuts, so chose not to go to hospital or to report the incident to police.</p>
      <p>Wirral Council said it was aware of issues with rocks being thrown from the bridge in the area.</p>
      <p>However, a spokesman for the local authority said it could not comment any further because of election purdah rules.</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old woman said: “I would like them to do something but I’m not even sure what they could do.</p>
      <p>“Even if they put a cage thing up, I’m not sure if it would reach high enough.”</p>
      <p>Both victims said they wanted to raise awareness of the dangers of the thoughtless crime, and how life-changing it could be.</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old said the dangerous crime could give car owners hefty bills before Christmas, and could even lead to a family without a loved one during the festive season.</p>
      <p>Rebecca said: "It needs sorting before someone is killed."</p>
