      <p>Hal Robson-Kanu got the Baggies off to a brilliant start after slotting home after Matheus Pereira's delightful pass.</p>
      <p>However, the game turned on its head in the second half, with Wednesday battling back level via the penalty spot, after Filip Krovinovic was deemed to have hauled down Kieran Lee.</p>
      <p>The game was on a knife-edge until Pereira was clipped by Keiren Westwood in the box, giving Charlie Austin the chance to put Albion ahead - which he did emphatically to ensure Albion secured all three points.</p>
