      <p>The teen car thief who went on a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/thief-swipes-car-with-2-kids-in-the-backseat-before-crashing-nearby/">joyride in Queens with two children in the backseat</a> and then crashed into a tree has been arrested, police said Saturday.</p>
      <p>The 16-year-old suspect, whose name was not released, swiped the car near Liberty Avenue and 92nd Street in Ozone Park at about 7:45 p.m. Friday night, officials said.</p>
      <p>He sped off in the stolen vehicle toward Brooklyn — with two frightened boys under the age of 10 in the backseat, police said.</p>
      <p>Shortly after, the teenager lost control of the car, crashing into a tree on Norwood Avenue in Cypress Hills.</p>
      <p>The children suffered minor injuries and were treated at the scene, then reunited with their mother, officials said.</p>
      <p>The joyriding thief was taken into custody and charged with grand larceny auto, endangering the welfare of a child, obstruction of justice, and two counts of reckless endangerment.</p>
      <p>A witness told The Post the rogue teen was speeding the wrong way down a one-way street.</p>
      <p>“It was going very fast. It was like Grand Theft Auto,” said witness Kenny Placencio, 27.</p>
