      <p>The King has tooted.</p>
      <p>Basketball star LeBron James responded to a fan request for an autograph by farting at him while leaving an Oklahoma steakhouse.</p>
      <p>LeBron and fellow basketballer Chris Paul were leaving the Mohagany Prime Steakhouse in Oklahoma City when the fans, who were recording the encounter, approached.</p>
      <p>Before entering a waiting SUV, James lifted his leg and offered a burst of flatulence so loud it was picked by the camera’s audio from the other side of the parking lot, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/23/lebron-james-fart-video-pulitzer/">TMZ reported</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s been a banner week for farting news, with Rep. Eric Swalwell also making national headlines after what appeared to be a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/congressman-eric-swalwell-appears-to-fart-on-live-tv/">loud fart during a live interview</a> with MSNBC host Chris Matthews.</p>
      <p>The network later said the sound was not a fart but was in fact caused by Matthews dragging his coffee cup across the desk.</p>
