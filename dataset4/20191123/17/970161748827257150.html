      <h1>Fresh calls for human rights group to investigate 'Tory party over Islamophobia'</h1>

      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/muslim/">Muslim</a> Council of Britain (MCB) is renewing its call for the UK’s human rights watchdog to launch an inquiry into Islamophobia in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/conservative-party/">Conservative Party</a>.</p>
      <p>The MCB had initially submitted a complaint of more than 20 pages to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) back in May, and are still waiting a response from the organisation.</p>
      <p>It comes after new allegations of Islamophobia in the party emerged among councillors and parliamentary candidates since then.</p>
      <p>In September, the BBC submitted evidence of more than 20 new cases to the party, which included one party member calling Muslims ‘scum’ and another writing ‘I don’t want Muslims in this country’.</p>
      <p>A poll by YouGov in June, carried out on behalf of the anti-racism charity Hope not Hate, also found that more than two-thirds of Tory members believe the myth that parts of the UK are under Sharia law, and nearly half would not want a Muslim as prime minister.</p>

      <p>The Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was also shown arguing with the Labour Party’s Andy McDonald following the BBC’s leaders debate yesterday, over racism in their respective parties.</p>
      <p>As he was accused of kicking Islamophobia into the long grass by Mr McDonald, Mr Raab replied: ‘Two parties in this country’s history have been investigated by the equalities and human rights commission, Labour under Corbyn and the BNP.’</p>

      <p>A spokesperson for the Muslim Council of Britain told Metro.co.uk: ‘Mr Raab may not be aware of the widespread calls on the EHRC to also investigate the Conservative Party over its deep-rooted issues with Islamophobia, and reluctance to tackle the issue.</p>
      <p>‘We have already called on the EHRC to launch an investigation earlier this year, but this is yet to be announced.</p>
      <p>‘Whilst the Conservative Party continues to shirk all responsibility over Islamophobia, the EHRC must intervene, and must do so as a matter of urgency. It must equally tackle all forms of bigotry in all parties.’</p>
      <p>During last night’s Question Time leaders’ debate, Boris Johnson said the Conservative Party had a ‘zero tolerance of Islamophobia’.</p>

        <figcaption>The MCB’s Miqdaad Versi has also called for an independent inquiry into Islamophobia into the Conservative Party</figcaption>

      <p>However, the MCB said his claim ‘did not stand up to scrutiny’, adding: ‘Until and unless the Conservative Party holds an investigation specifically into Islamophobia itself, it cannot claim to have any monopoly into fighting bigotry.’</p>

      <p>The EHRC told Metro.co.uk that it is still ‘determining whether any action is needed’.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the commission said: ‘We have received complaints regarding the Conservative Party and are considering them in line with our usual processes.</p>
      <p>‘As part of our standard process, we wrote to the Conservative Party to ask for information in order to help assess the complaints.</p>
      <p>‘We have received a response and are considering this alongside the complaints we have received to determine whether any action is needed.’</p>
