      <p>The 52-year-old disgraced R&amp;B singer, who is currently battling multiple sex crime charges in New York and Chicago, promised to help with Savage's music career so she dropped out of the college and moved in with him but that's when he started to change.</p>

      <p>“After these couple of months Robert started giving me commands, and making sure I call him by certain names. Like ‘Master’ or ‘Daddy’ which I didn’t really care for at the time, ” Savage wrote, per The Daily Beast.</p>
      <p>“If I wasn’t getting paid or pursuing my dream I would’ve went home, but all of that didn’t stop just yet. But It started getting worse by day by day, he would raise his voice at me if I didn’t call him by those two names. If Robert called me I would have to reply with ‘Yes, daddy’ or ‘Please daddy’ he was so controlling.”</p>

      <p>“He would always would say ‘All this can stop today, you want a career? Or do you want to live a normal life’ basically trying to make me do what he wants,” she wrote.</p>
      <p>Savage previously supported Kelly and attended his court hearings along with his other live-in girlfriend Azriel Clary, 21.</p>
      <p>She told Gayle King in a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/gayle-king-interviews-2-women-who-are-reportedly-dating-r-kelly">tell-all "CBS This Morning" interview</a> in March that claims she's been brainwashed by Kelly are untrue and that her family is "basically out here just to get money."</p>

      <p>Kelly pleaded not guilty in August to the New York charges, which accuse him of using his fame to recruit young women and girls for illegal sexual activity. Kelly is also charged with kidnapping, forced labor and violations of the federal Mann Act involving transporting women and girls across state lines to engage in illegal sexual activity.</p>

      <p>The defense has labeled Kelly's accusers disgruntled groupies.</p>
      <p>In October, a federal judge in New York City <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/r-kelly-denied-bail-trial-date-set-for-2020">denied him bail</a> after prosecutors said freeing the singer created a risk of him fleeing or tampering with witnesses in the sex abuse case against him.</p>
