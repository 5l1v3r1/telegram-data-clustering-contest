      <p>Charlie Austin’s penalty was the clincher for West Brom, with Hal Robson-Kanu and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Steven+Fletcher">Steven Fletcher</a> (penalty) having traded earlier strikes. <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Liam+Palmer">Liam Palmer</a> was sent off for Wednesday in time added on.</p>
      <p>At Kenilworth Road, Patrick Bamford’s goal for Leeds was cancelled out by <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=James+Collins">James Collins</a>, with <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=James+Pearson">James Pearson</a> then putting through his own goal to win it for United, despite it looking as though Bamford was claiming it himself.</p>

      <p>Michael O’Neill’s first home game in charge of Stoke ended in a second win thanks to Mame Biram Diouf’s 90th-minute goal in a 2-1 victory over Wigan.</p>
