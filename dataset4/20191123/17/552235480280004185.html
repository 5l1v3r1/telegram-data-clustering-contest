      <h1>Jeremie Frimpong earns Celtic plaudits as Neil Lennon provides Jonny Hayes injury update</h1>
      <h2>The 18-year-old was the star man in today's 4-0 win over Livingston at Celtic Park.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:41:54+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:41</time> by <a rel="author">Gabriel McKay</a></address>
      <p>Celtic manager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> raved about<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jeremie-frimpong"> Jeremie Frimpong</a>'s performance after the young right-back ripped Livingston to shreds.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old started in Saturday's 4-0 win, which lifted the Hoops three points clear of Rangers at the top of the league.</p>
      <p>Steven Gerrard's men will have the chance to close that gap on Sunday, but the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> manager sees his own side in formidable form.</p>
      <p>Lennon told <i><b>BBC Radio Scotland</b></i> at the end of the match: "I'm thrilled, it was a lot better than I could have expected.</p>

      <p>"We had good control of the game against a good side, we scored a great opening goal and we missed a couple of great chances to be even more ahead at half-time.</p>
      <p>"The quality of the performance and the pace we played at was fantastic and second half we asked: 'you've got good control of the game, can you go and get a few more goals?'.</p>
      <p>"They're answering all the challenges that are asked of them at the minute. A comprehensive in off the back of two week break: I can't ask for any more from the players.</p>
      <p>"We look fit, we look powerful, and we're playing with real intent at the minute.</p>

      <p>"For a player of that age and that inexperience he's come in here and hit the ground running really well. He was outstanding today.</p>
      <p>"I've not seen many better performances in my time. As a right-back the chances he created, the goals he could have scored, the recovery runs - everything about his game today was of a really high quality.</p>
      <p>"He's made the team better and that's a big compliment I can pay him."</p>
      <p>Scott Brown also got his name on the score sheet, with a deflected strike from the edge of the box to make it 2-0.</p>
      <p>Lennon said: "He's playing brilliantly.</p>

      <p>"He was brilliant again today. Goals are always a bonus and he strikes the ball really well at times, and he got his just reward today.</p>
      <p>"It was a great goal, we moved Livingston around from side to side and Browny took the opportunity beautifully, albeit it got a deflection.</p>
      <p>"It was a fully deserved goal from player who's at the top of his game."</p>
      <p>Leigh Griffiths came off the bench to a rapturous reception but there's concern over <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jonny-hayes">Jonny Hayes</a> who had to be taken off with a shoulder injury.</p>

      <p>"That'll do him (Griffiths) the world of good. He almost scored and he's sniffing out chances, he's looking more and more like himself.</p>
      <p>"(Hayes) landed on his shoulder really awkwardly very early and it looks like he's popped it a little bit. We'll have to scan it and see what the diagnosis is, hopefully he won't be out for too long.</p>
