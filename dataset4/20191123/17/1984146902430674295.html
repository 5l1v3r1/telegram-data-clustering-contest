      <p>Sunderland’s winless run stretched to five games, but they at least earned a point from their league home clash with Coventry City.</p>
      <p>Teenage Swedish striker Benji Kimpioka came to the Black Cats’ rescue, although a point is still far from good enough as they fell to tenth in the table and were still booed off the pitch.</p>
      <p>Here’s the game at a glance.</p>
      <p>The goals</p>
      <p>26 mins: GOAL Coventry 1-0, Hyam - Maguire’s poor back pass sends Bakayoko through. Burge out to concede the corner, but Hyam heads home from the resulting set-piece</p>
      <p>90 mins: GOAL Sunderland 1-1, Kimpioka - Bit of pinball in the box, it eventually gets worked to Kimpioka in a good position to side foot into the bottom corner across goal</p>
      <p>The tactics</p>
      <p>Looking for added balance and protection against a Coventry side who like to counter with pace, Phil Parkinson went with a three-man central midfield for this one, with Grant Leadbitter sitting a little deeper than usual midfield duo Max Power and George Dobson. That left a front-three of Chris Maguire, Aiden McGeady and Will Grigg, who were all in need of confidence-boosting performances.</p>
      <p>Their approach was direct, like on Tuesday, but far more purposeful as the three forwards looked to run off the last shoulder. As has been the case for too long now though, Sunderland just lacked any cutting edge in the final third and created very little.</p>
      <p>The game-changing moment</p>
      <p>This game was very much typical Sunderland. They were just creating absolutely nothing. In truth they never looked like scoring and then shot themselves in the foot when Chris Maguire gave the ball away in the 25th minute, which ultimately lead to the corner Coventry scored from.</p>

      <p>That moment changed the game in that early promise and a bit of foundation built in the game was gone, and from there Sunderland were in free-fall.</p>
      <p>But the game changed again in the 82nd minute when Parkinson played his final card - something of a desperation move.</p>
      <p>He threw on 19-year-old Benji Kimpioka in the 82nd minute - and it was telling that Will Grigg was booed as he left the field.</p>
      <p>The change hardly improved Sunderland’s build up play, but it at least earned them a point. A lucky break in the box lead to Kimpioka finding space to fire in a last minute equaliser.</p>
      <p>The stand-out performance</p>
      <p>There was hardly a stand-out performer from a Sunderland perspective, but their brightest player on the day was Aiden McGeady.</p>
      <p>He could have won a penalty in the first half when he looked to have been brought down in the penalty area as he looked to shoot.</p>
      <p>That came from his trademark cut inside, feint to shoot, beat his man. And the same move did fashion a good chance for himself in the 67th minute. His good low strike was well saved by Marko Marosi, however.</p>
      <p>It was another poor day for Sunderland - particularly in the final third. McGeady didn’t do much, but he looked the only player in red-and-white capable of scoring.</p>
      <p>The positive to take</p>
      <p>Quite simply, there wasn’t one. As we feared, their recent cup form has seeped into their league form and they’ve fallen to tenth in the league now.</p>
      <p>The late equaliser at least means they don’t lose, and stay eight points behind second-placed Ipswich who also drew. But a draw was not good enough.</p>
      <p>The negative</p>
      <p>Everything. Sunderland are in free-fall right now and yet again they just look so flat. The players have no fire and look so mentally fragile. They started well enough, but still struggled to create any chances of note. They then shot themselves in the foot to concede and never looked likely to score after that - the players sinking into their shells.</p>

      <p>They got a lucky break and got an equaliser - a great moment for Kimpioka - but everyone knows it’s not good enough, and they were still booed off at full-time.</p>
      <p>The verdict</p>
      <p>Sunderland are in real trouble. Another game without a win, this time in the league when it matters, adds yet more pressure to Phil Parkinson who has won just two of his first ten - hardly a new manager bounce.</p>
      <p>The players look so low on confidence and it’s hard to see where another win is coming from.</p>
      <p>We keep talking about how important January will be, unless things improve dramatically before that, the season could be as good as over before we even get to the next transfer window.</p>
