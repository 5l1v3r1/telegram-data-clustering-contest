      <h1>Todd Cantwell helps Norwich to first away win of the season at Everton</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:14:07+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andyhunter" target="_blank">Andy Hunter</a></address>
      <p>Dennis Srbeny’s stoppage-time goal, scruffy in execution but glorious in every other respect for Norwich, was the cue for a mass exodus of Evertonians. Yet their damning, brutal dismissal of Marco Silva had only just begun. The travelling fans celebrated their first away win of the season with a rendition of: “You’re getting sacked in the morning.” The home fans who remained joined in.</p>
      <p>Another step backwards for the beleaguered Everton manager constituted a giant leap for Daniel Farke and Norwich. They started the day at the foot of the table and without an away goal in the Premier League since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/liverpool-norwich-city-premier-league-match-report">the opening night of the season at Anfield</a>. It never showed. Norwich were bright and adventurous from the start, strong and resilient when Everton applied late pressure and departed with their first away win of the campaign courtesy of Todd Cantwell’s polished finish and substitute Srbeny’s late strike. Victory was richly deserved over a weak, laboured and clueless Everton team who are now four points off the relegation places with Leicester, Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United up next.</p>
      <p>Silva’s hold on his job looks precarious in the extreme. His treatment from the home crowd left the watching Farhad Moshiri, Everton’s major shareholder, and the chairman, Bill Kenwright, in no doubt as to the lack of faith and belief in the manager’s methods, or ability to galvanise a passionless group of players. “It is not the moment to talk about individual positions,” was Silva’s response to whether he expected to remain Everton’s manager. “I have to respect the feelings of the fans. It is not the first time. We didn’t play well enough to win. There was no intensity and not enough pace or mobility to disorganise them.” He had talks after the game with Moshiri and Marcel Brands, the director of football.</p>
      <p>Jordan Pickford was the busier goalkeeper throughout as the marauding Onel Hernández and Norwich’s sharp, crisp passing, plus their ability to bully Everton’s defenders, exposed the home side’s soft underbelly. Sam Byram, Kenny McLean and Hernández all tested the England international before he produced a superb stop to prevent the Cuban winger breaking the deadlock. McLean released Hernández clear of a static rearguard and, with Yerry Mina desperately trying to close him down, drove hard and low towards the bottom corner. Pickford reacted expertly to save low to his right and Djibril Sidibé, one of several outfield players to struggle in royal blue, headed the rebound to safety.</p>
      <p>Urgency and intensity made their belated appearance in the Everton display at the start of the second half but Norwich responded with resilience and determination. Ben Godfrey epitomised both qualities in the heart of the visitors’ defence, throwing himself in the way of a goal-bound shot by Cenk Tosun and commanding his area impressively alongside Christoph Zimmermann. The availability of two fit central defenders for Farke, for the first time in months, made a telling difference. The long wait for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague">Premier League</a> away goal and a merited lead ended when Everton were undone by weak defending and Norwich’s quicker reactions.</p>
      <p>Zimmermann started the move with a long ball out of defence that was headed into the path of Teemu Pukki. Mason Holgate and Mina closed in on the Norwich striker but he was too strong for both, and worked the ball into the chasm left by Everton’s central defenders. Cantwell was the first to spot the opportunity and seized it brilliantly, bursting through the middle before beating Pickford with a low, measured finish inside the near post.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton">Everton</a> stirred only for Tim Krul to deny the otherwise anonymous Gylfi Sigurdsson plus Tosun and Tom Davies. In stoppage time Srbeny brushed aside Holgate inside the area to scramble the ball past Pickford and spark the outpouring of dissent against Silva.</p>
      <p>“We showed if we stick together that we have the tools and the mentality and the quality to have a chance in every game,” said a delighted Norwich manager. Silva’s reign, by contrast, is falling apart.</p>
