      <h1>False reports regarding dancer nominee for Pakistan Medical Commission go viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:27:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:27</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/dunyanews</a></address>
      <p>(AFP) - A photo has been shared hundreds of times in multiple Facebook posts published in 2019 which claim it shows a dancer nominated by the government for the Pakistan Medical Commission, which has regulated the country’s medical profession since October 2019.</p>
      <p>The claim is false; the photo is a screenshot from a video of dancer Qismat Baig, who was murdered in 2016.</p>
      <p>The photo was published in this Facebook post on October 25, 2019. It has been shared more than 980 times.</p>
      <p>The post’s English-language caption states: “lot of congratulation to doctor community, miss Roshuna Zafar famous dancer appointed as member of Pakistan medical commission (pmc) by our respected govt of Pakistan. Hope she will introduce latest dancing guide line and tips in field of medicine.”</p>
      <p>Below is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:</p>

      <p>The medical body referred to in the post was known as the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council up until October 20, 2019, when its name changed to the Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC).</p>
      <p>“Roshuna Zafar” post refers to Pakistani development practitioner Roshaneh Zafar, who was appointed to the PMC in October 2019, according to this report published by private newspaper on October 25, 2019.</p>
      <p><a href="http://pmc.pakistan.gov.pk/Approved%20Minutes%20of%201st%20Meeting%20of%20PMC.pdf">Here is an online document</a> of the minutes from the first meeting of the Pakistan Medical Commission, successor of Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC), attended by Zafar.</p>
      <p>The same image was published on Facebook with a similar claim.</p>
      <p>The claim is false. A reverse image search for the photo on Google found the image was a screenshot from a YouTube video of Pakistani dancer Qismat Baig, who was shot dead in 2016.</p>
      <p>Below is a screenshot of the YouTube video at the three-minute 25-second mark:</p>

      <p>Baig was shot dead in 2016 in Lahore, as reported on November 24, 2016.</p>
      <p>The report’s headline states: “Stage actor Kismat Baig shot dead by gunmen in Lahore.”</p>
      <p>The report states in part: “Stage actor Kismat Baig who was shot eight times by unidentified gunmen in Lahore died on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>“Kismat Baig was moved to the emergency ward at Services Hospital after the incident, said Superintendent Police Tahir Rehman.</p>
      <p>“The actor was travelling with her driver and personal assistant, both of whom also sustained gunshot wounds.”</p>
      <p>Here is Zafar’s official profile on the Pakistan’s National Assembly website.</p>
