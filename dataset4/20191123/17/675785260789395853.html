      <h2>Donald Sheridan was sentenced by Judge Rodney Jameson QC at Leeds Crown Court for pulling a woman into the bushes and threatening to rape her the month after he was allowed out on parole</h2>

      <p>A convicted murderer dragged a mum-of-two into bushes and threatened to rape her while strangling her.</p>
      <p>Donald Sheridan grabbed hold of the woman from behind as she was walking home from the gym in Leeds.</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old throttled the woman in the bushes and forced her to put on a pair of tights, <a href="https://www.leeds-live.co.uk/news/leeds-news/fetish-murderer-lied-parole-board-17302763">Leeds Live reported.</a></p>
      <p>After threatening to rape her, Sheridan let the woman go when a dog walker came past.</p>
      <p>The thug, who had been released from prison a month before the June 2 attack, later told police she wasn't "his type" but he probably would have raped and killed the victim if she'd been older.</p>
      <p>In his first court appearance in relation to the crime, Sheridan attacked a female dock officer as she tried to take him back to his cell.</p>
      <p>Sentencing him on Friday, Judge Rodney Jameson QC warned him that he is likely to stay in prison until he is too old and frail to be a danger to elderly women.</p>

      <p>Det Insp Al Burns, of Leeds District CID, said: "Sheridan’s actions have shown him to be a very dangerous and predatory individual who clearly presents a serious risk to women.</p>
      <p>"The victim that he attacked in Holbeck was put through an absolutely terrifying ordeal and was left traumatised by what he did, as was the female custody officer that he later assaulted at court.</p>
      <p>"The offences he committed caused understandable concern in the community at the time, and we are very grateful to all those members of the public who provided information that assisted our enquiries."</p>
      <p>Sheridan was locked up in 1986 for raping and murdering a 67-year-old woman in south Wales.</p>
      <p>He had been released and housed in a probation hostel in Leeds in May this year, under strict conditions including an alcohol ban.</p>
      <p>Less than a month later Sheridan drank rum and took "a considerable amount of money" to meet a female sex worker in the city's managed sex zone at around noon on June 2 this year.</p>
      <p>While they were behind a skip in a commercial yard the sex worker made a phone call.</p>
      <p>A short while later a number of men turned up and stole Sheridan's money.</p>

      <p>After they left he headed to a disused railway bridge where he decided to sit in some bushes.</p>
      <p>When a lone woman walked past he pounced, pulling her back into the bushes.</p>
      <p>Sheridan demanded that she lie down and give him money before he started strangling her.</p>
      <p>She pleaded with him to stop after giving him £10 and offering to transfer more money.</p>
      <p>The woman said she had two children at home as she begged for him not to kill her.</p>
      <p>Sheridan said he wouldn't killed her, but continued strangling the woman before asking her to kiss and perform a sex act on him.</p>
      <p>She refused, prompting him to take two pairs of women's tights out and force her to put them on.</p>
      <p>Sheridan let the woman go when a dog walker came near the bush but made her take the tights off first and asked her not to tell anyone.</p>
      <p>The court heard the victim, who believed she was going to die during the attack, ran from the scene.</p>
      <p>Hostel staff noticed Sheridan was drunk when he returned at 10.30pm, in breach of his licence conditions.</p>
      <p>Police later found tights covered in the defendant's DNA at the scene.</p>
      <p>The court heard police connected the two incidents, traced Sheridan using footage from CCTV cameras in the area and arrested him.</p>
      <p>When he was interviewed by police on June 13 Sheridan denied involvement to begin with before he started making admissions.</p>
      <p>He claimed he only dragged her into the bush because he had been robbed, adding: "Well she's not my type really, do you know what I mean?"</p>
      <p>Sheridan told officers he had had a fetish for older women since he saw a naked nun while he was in care as a child.</p>
      <p>He said he stole the nun's tights, wore them to bed and carried women's tights around with him ever since, adding: "It's a comfort blanket for me."</p>
      <p>Sheridan said making the victim wear the tights did not 'do it' for him as he intended.</p>
      <p>Sheridan was asked what would have happened if the woman had been older and the tights had "done it for him" and he replied: "Might have raped her, might have killed her, I don't know."</p>
      <p>He said he still experiences urges to rape and murder women, especially strangling them, and he had recently felt the urge to strangle an older sex worker after using her services.</p>

      <p>Sheridan claimed he had let the victim go because she kept talking and he felt bad for her children and not because of the dogwalker.</p>
      <p>After he made his first court appearance in relation to the offences the following day, he attacked a dock officer as soon as she took off his handcuffs in his cell.</p>
      <p>He lunged at her and began to strangle her before another prison officer pulled him off</p>
      <p>Sheridan later told a police that he could have carried on strangling her until she died.</p>
      <p>Before his sentencing the court heard how Sheridan's victim in 1986 had been naked aside from a pair of tights.</p>
      <p>He only admitted rape and murder after he was jailed for life.</p>
      <p>Sheridan, who appeared in court via video link from Wakefield prison, pleaded guilty to robbery, false imprisonment, committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.</p>
      <p>He was sentenced to 11 years' imprisonment and life imprisonment with a minimum term of five-and-a-half years.</p>
      <p>Sheridan was sentenced in his absence after telling the judge he did not 'need' to hear the details of his offences repeated by the judge.</p>
      <p>Det Insp Burns added: "Sheridan was caught as a result of a detailed and comprehensive investigation by detectives supported by specialist forensic expertise.</p>
      <p>"We hope the victims will be able to take some comfort from knowing that he has been brought to justice, and we hope the community will be reassured to know that he is now safely behind bars."</p>
