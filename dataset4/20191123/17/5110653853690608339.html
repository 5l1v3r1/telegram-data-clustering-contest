      <p>Rockets star Russell Westbrook and Clippers guard Patrick Beverley added another chapter to their longstanding beef after both players fouled out of Friday night's exciting game in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>With less than 10 seconds remainingand the Clippers leading by one point, Paul George left Westbrook to double-team James Harden, givingWestbrooka potential game-winning 3-pointer. Westbrook bricked the shot, then fouled George to stop the clock, sending him to the bench for the restof regulation. The Clippers went on to win by a final score of 122-119.</p>

      <p>Beverley, who had fouled out earlier in the quarter, was seen mocking Westbrook's miss from the bench and yelling in his direction. ESPN cameras also caught Westbrook responding on the other end.He appeared to be screaming "trash" at Beverley during one close-up shot.</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, Westbrook <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/russell-westbrook-patrick-beverley-defender-stats-rockets/y80uk2wk6bnu1atiq11eajwwf">shot down the idea</a> that Beverley is an elite defender. His comments came after Harden scored 47 points in a 102-93 victory.</p>
      <p>"Pat Bev trick y'all, man, like he play defense," Westbrook said. "He don't guard nobody, man. Hejust running around, doing nothing."</p>
      <p>Of course, those words only added fuel to a fire that has been burning for years.</p>
      <p>Beverley knocked Westbrook out of the 2013 playoffs when he collided with Westbrook's knee on a steal attempt, resulting in a torn right meniscus for Westbrook. The next year, Beverley swiped the ball away from Westbrook on a similar play, and the two had to be separated along the sideline. In the 2017 playoffs, Westbrook committed a hard foul on Beverley and smacked him below the belt. Just last season, Beverley dove for a loose ball and drilled Westbrook's right knee again, leading to another confrontation and technical fouls on both players.</p>
      <p>To put it simply, this isn't going away. The Clippers and Rockets meet again on Dec. 19. Buckle up.</p>
