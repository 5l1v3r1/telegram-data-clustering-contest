      <p>Bleeding ‘eck! Yorkshire drivers are the angriest in Britain, according to a survey.</p>
      <p>More than one in five admit to regular bouts of road rage.</p>
      <p>Most common outbursts include winding down windows to swear at other drivers, making offensive gestures, tailgating and honking horns repeatedly.</p>
      <p>Some 21 per cent of people in Yorkshire admitted they often blew a gasket behind the wheel – making the region joint top with Scotland.</p>
      <p>Motorists from the North West and Wales were close behind with 20 per cent saying they often lost it, while 19 per cent saw red on the road in the West Midlands.</p>
      <p>Drivers from the South West of England were the most mild-mannered, with just 13 per cent confessing to a fit of road rage in the past month.</p>
      <p>They were closely followed by drivers in East Anglia, where 14 per cent had frequent flare-ups.</p>
      <h3>The angriest</h3>
      <p>1. Yorkshire &amp; Humber</p>
      <p>2. Scotland</p>
      <p>3. North West</p>

      <p>The findings are based on a survey of 2,000 people for GPS gadget maker Garmin.</p>
      <p>Road rage can result in criminal penalties, including a £1,000 fine and three points on your licence for making a rude gesture or even honking your horn if police judge you were not in control of your vehicle.</p>
      <p>For more serious offenses, like assaults, tailgating or swerving at other drivers, motorists can face much more serious penalties.</p>
      <p>Bosses at Garmin have teamed up with road safety charity Brake to launch its Eye On The Road campaign to promote the use of dash-cam technology designed to encourage safer driving by alerting drivers to mistakes.</p>
      <p>Garmin managing director Jon Oliver said: “Road rage can put drivers in troubling situations or, even worse, severe accidents.</p>
      <p>“Garmin’s dash-cam technology can record scenarios indicative of road rage such as speeding, tailgating, aggression or flashing headlights which people can later review.”</p>
