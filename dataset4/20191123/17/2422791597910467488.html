      <p>TORONTO -- Alexandra Arkhipova's children are adults and her grandchildren have all grown up, but the 67 year old still has a passion for caring for young children.</p>
      <p>Lucky for her, that passion is in high demand in the Russian city she calls home.</p>
      <p>Many of the residents of Vladimir, Russia, which is located about 200 kilometres east of Moscow, leave for higher paying work in the capital. The abundance of commuters has created a shortage of professionals like babysitters and housekeepers in the city.</p>
      <p>So for the last three years, a local government social welfare centre has been running the "Granny-for-an-hour" project as a way to pair up seniors with families struggling to care for their children.</p>
      <p>As part of the program, women like Arkhipova visit a family in need a few times a week, to help with household chores and childcare. The volunteer "grannies" receive training in skills ranging from foreign languages to IT in exchange for their time.</p>
      <p>Arkhipova says the program keeps her active, improves her emotional well-being, and gives her a chance to relive her days as a mother and grandmother. She's also being taught how to use a computer by the mother of the family she's volunteering with.</p>
      <p>"We need to be active later in life, to be needed by someone, you know, to realize our opportunities and energy," says Arkhipova.</p>
      <p>Arkhipova volunteers with Irina Sabitova, a single mother who has been raising five kids alone ever since her husband left the family. Sabitova's seven-year-old son Sasha has Down syndrome.</p>
      <p>Known to the family as "Granny Sasha," Arkhipova plays with the children at the local playground, takes them to school, and teaches them art and music.</p>
      <p>Yelena Chentsova, the director of the social welfare centre that started "Granny-for-an-hour," says some of the volunteers have also received child psychology training as part of the project.</p>
      <p>"A few people have been trained because it's clear that not just anyone can be let in to other people's families," Says Chentsova. "Generally in a family with a child, a person needs to be prepared."</p>
