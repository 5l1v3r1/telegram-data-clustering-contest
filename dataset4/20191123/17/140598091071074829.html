      <h1>American public loses enthusiasm for impeachment despite blockbuster hearings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:59:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/nick-allen/" target="_blank">Nick Allen</a></address>
      <p>Democrats hoped it would be the week that Donald Trump was hoist with his own petard.</p>
      <p>A parade of witnesses, including former aides to the president, strode into Congress to deliver seemingly damning testimony to the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>But the blockbuster hearings, which reached a huge television audience, appeared instead to have swung public support back towards Mr Trump.</p>
      <p>A national poll by Emerson College, taken during the hearings, between Nov 17 and Nov 20, found 45 per cent now oppose impeaching the president, with 43 per cent in favour.</p>
      <p>In October the same poll had a majority, 48 per cent, in favour of impeachment, with 44 per cent opposed.</p>
      <p>Over the last week the hearings dominated the political discourse in the United States as a series of witnesses suggested Mr Trump had offered a "quid pro quo" to the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy.</p>
      <p>The central plank of the allegations is that the US president withheld $392 million in military assistance to Ukraine unless Mr Zelenskiy publicly announced a corruption investigation into the business dealings of the Biden family in that country.</p>
      <p>The new poll revealed a particularly large swing of six points against <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/donald-trump-impeachment/">impeachment</a> among independent voters. The polls showed 49 per cent of independents were now against impeachment, with 34 per cent in favour.</p>

      <p>Despite the blanket television coverage of the hearings only seven per cent of voters thought impeachment was the most important issue.</p>
      <p>The top issue for Republicans and independent voters was the economy, and for Democrats it was healthcare.</p>
      <p>A separate poll taken in the election battleground state of Wisconsin found 40 per cent thought Mr Trump should be impeached and removed, and 53 per cent said he should not.</p>
      <p>The Wisconsin poll found "consistent, if sometimes modest, shifts in public opinion away from support of impeachment."</p>
      <p>Mr Trump seized on the results, writing on Twitter: "Polls have now turned very strongly against Impeachment!"</p>
      <p>The president's approval rating has remained steady through the impeachment crisis so far.</p>
      <p>A vote in the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives on whether to impeach him is expected before Christmas, which would set up a trial in the Senate.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the vote Republican groups are spending millions of dollars on anti-impeachment TV adverts in districts represented by vulnerable Democrats.</p>
      <p>Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the House, said he: "I don’t know if it’s even going to get to the Senate."</p>
      <p>Mr Trump has said he welcomes a trial. His defence is being coordinated by Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel.</p>
      <p>The White House wants to limit the length of the trial, perhaps to as little as two weeks.</p>
      <p>A spokesman indicated they would be willing to call Joe Biden, and his son Hunter, as witnesses.</p>
      <p>Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was handling Ukraine policy as vice-president during the Obama administration.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, faced being dragged into the impeachment affair.</p>
      <p>An ethics group published nearly 100 pages of documents obtained from the State Department that it says clearly detail contacts between Mr Pompeo and Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer.</p>
      <p>Mr Giuliani has been at the centre of accusations that Ukraine was being pressured to investigate the Bidens.</p>
