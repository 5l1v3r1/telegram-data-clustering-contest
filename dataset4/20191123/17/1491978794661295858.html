      <h1>James Forrest scores two as Celtic beat Livingston to open gap at top</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:27:39+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/23/PA%20Media" target="_blank">PA Media</a></address>
      <p>Celtic opened up a three-point gap over Rangers at the top of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/scottish-premiership">Scottish Premiership</a> with a convincing home victory over Livingston.</p>
      <p>The French striker Odsonne Édouard opened the scoring in the 19th minute and a deflected strike by skipper Scott Brown in the 57th minute preceded a double from winger James Forrest.</p>
      <p>Neil Lennon’s side have now won eight games in succession since losing to Livingston in West Lothian last month, their only domestic defeat this season. Rangers have the chance to close the gap at Hamilton on Sunday, while Lennon’s men will prepare to take on Rennes in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/07/lazio-celtic-europa-league-match-report">Europa League</a> on Thursday, safe in the knowledge that they are already through to the last 32 of the competition.</p>
      <p>Home fans were happy to see their striker Leigh Griffiths, whose last appearance was at the end of August due to personal problems and injury, back on the bench.</p>
      <p>Celtic were finding it difficult to get behind Livingston’s defence but when Édouard did he scored with his trademark composure. Gary Holt’s side were looking for an offside flag when Tom Rogic sent the Frenchman racing clear but that never came and despite the attention of chasing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/livingston">Livingston</a> defender Ricki Lamie, the 21-year-old dinked the ball from 14 yards over Matija Sarkic. Celtic relaxed and grew in confidence. Édouard’s drive from the edge of the box in the 34th minute, after Forrest had cushioned a searching pass from Rogic straight to his feet, was saved by Sarkic, who made a much better block from Forrest’s powerful drive four minutes later after he had been again set up by Ryan Christie.</p>
      <p>The home side finished off the half with Rogic blazing a cut-back from the tireless Jeremie Frimpong over the bar.</p>
      <p>Greg Taylor replaced Jonny Hayes five minutes into the second half and the left-back soon crashed a shot against the inside the post.</p>
      <p>Seconds later, with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic">Celtic</a> fans encouraging Brown to shoot from 20 yards when he took control of a Christie pass, the veteran midfielder duly obliged and the ball took a deflection before leaving Sarkic stranded.</p>
      <p>Forrest’s first goal came after Frimpong’s angled-drive was saved by Sarkic, the ball spinning high into the air and the Celtic winger despatching it from 10 yards when it descended.</p>
      <p>That further cushion allowed Lennon to replace Édouard with Griffiths, who got a huge cheer from the home support who subsequently gasped when he could not connect properly with a Frimpong cross in the 78th minute. Sarkic then made a great top-corner save from Christie before Forrest raced through on to a pass from the former Inverness midfielder in added time to slot in his second and put the pressure on their Old Firm rivals for today.</p>
      <p>Lennon was impressed by his charges. “The quality of the performance and the pace that we played at was fantastic. They are answering all the challenges we’re asking of them at the minute.</p>
      <p>Holt said: “It’s wee individual mistakes we need to look at and we need to eradicate.”</p>
