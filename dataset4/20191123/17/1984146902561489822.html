      <p>Benji Kimpioka came off the bench to salvage a last-gasp point for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> , sparing them a damaging home defeat at the hands of Coventry City.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old had only been on the pitch for a little over five minutes when he hit the 89th minute equaliser – his first senior league goal – to cancel out Dominic Hyam’s first-half opener.</p>
      <p>There was relief all-round at the Stadium of Light when Kimpioka’s goal went in and it meant there was only muted booing when the full-time whistle blew, but there was no getting away from the fact that Sunderland had got out of jail in a game that they simply could not afford to lose.</p>
      <p>Because had Coventry frontman Amadou Bakayoko made the most of even a couple of the four clear chances that came his way, the game would have been over before half-time.</p>
      <p>As it was, the draw still meant the Black Cats slipped one place to tenth in the table, and the gap between themselves and the top six has widened to three points, while they remain eight points outside the automatic places.</p>
      <p>They still have at least one game in hand of most of the clubs above them, but this performance did little to instil confidence that they will make up ground and launch an automatic promotion challenge.</p>
      <p>Phil Parkinson made four changes to the side that exited the FA Cup at Gillingham in midweek.</p>
      <p>Centre-backs Jordan Willis and Joel Lynch returned from injury and took the place of Brandon Taylor and Alim Ozturk.</p>
      <p>Midfielder George Dobson also missed the trip to the Priestfield Stadium due to injury but he was back in the starting XI in place of Laurens De Bock.</p>
      <p>And Aiden McGeady stepped up from the bench to replace Duncan Watmore, who was named amongst the subs.</p>

      <p>The changes meant Parkinson switched away from the back three he used against the Gills to revert to a back four.</p>
      <p>Coventry boss Mark Robins made two changes to the side that beat Rochdale in the league last weekend.</p>
      <p>Kyle McFadzean returned from suspension and Liam Kelly from illness, replacing Declan Drysdale and Josh Eccles.</p>
      <p>After dire performances and miserable cup exits in recent weeks, Sunderland needed to produce a reaction as they went into the first of back-to-back home league games.</p>
      <p>But their poor form continued against the Sky Blues, and they were lucky to find themselves just a single goal down at the break as they left the field to a chorus of boos.</p>
      <p>Bakayoko had brought two saves out of ex-Coventry keeper Lee Burge even before the visitors took the lead.</p>
      <p>Bakayoko sent a shot on the turn straight at Burge from inside the area, and a few minutes later found himself one-on-one with the keeper thanks to a terrible backpass from Chris Maguire and this time Burge came off his line to block the shot behind for a corner.</p>
      <p>But it was from that set-piece that the visitors went in front.</p>

      <p>The corner was taken short on the left, then a deep cross to the far post was headed back across goal by Michael Rose and Hyam nodded in from close range.</p>
      <p>Bakayoko could have killed the game before the interval, with only a smart block from another ex-Coventry man Willis preventing him getting a shot away inside the penalty area, and then on the stroke of half-time he glanced a header wide from inside the six-yard box under pressure from Burge.</p>
      <p>By contrast, the best Sunderland could manage in the opening 45 minutes was a tame 25-yard free-kick from McGeady which was straight at keeper Marko Marosi.</p>
      <p>Sunderland showed no signs of getting back into the game in the early stages of the second half, and Burge was forced into another stop, this time from a shot on the turn by Jordan Shipley.</p>
      <p>And it was not until Watmore replaced Max Power midway through the second period that the Black Cats began to get going, with the substitute’s pace and willingness to run at defenders unsettling Coventry a little.</p>
      <p>Sunderland had a great chance to equalise in the final ten minutes when Dobson intercepted the ball in midfield, but he tried to go on his own – and saw his shot blocked – when he should have played in the unmarked Watmore to his right.</p>

      <p>But Sunderland snatched a draw right at the death when the ball came into the box from the left and Coventry failed to clear. Watmore kept it alive inside the penalty area and Grant Leadbitter played in Kimpioka who sidefooted home from six yards out.</p>
