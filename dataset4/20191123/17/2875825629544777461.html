      <h1>Arsenal 2-2 Southampton: 5 talking points as pressure mounts on Unai Emery</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal's winless streak stretched to five games after they were held by the struggling Saints at the Emirates on Saturday afternoon</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:00:13+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal were booed off despite striker Alexandre Lacazette's last-gasp leveller against Southampton.</p>
      <p>The Gunners' winless run extended to five games to leave them off the pace in the race for the top four.</p>
      <p>James Ward-Prowse's late effort looked like being enough to earn the Saints victory before Lacazette's late intervention.</p>
      <p>Arsenal had to recover from an early deficit as they were caught out by Ryan Bertrand's quick free-kick and Danny Ings fired Southampton in front.</p>
      <p>Lacazette levelled in the 18th minute, though, after strike partner Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's shot was blocked by Bertrand.</p>

      <h3>Emery losing support</h3>
      <p>A changing of the guard up the Seven Sisters Road has brought a new dynamism to the Premier League sacking season.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> manager Unai Emery's body language has all the joy of a condemned man prowling the exercise yard the night before he has an appointment with the firing squad.</p>
      <p>After nearly 18 months in charge, the only thing Emery does with conviction is to greet the media “Good ebening” - and he is in danger of matching the gendarme's “Good moaning” in spoof sitcom 'Allo 'Allo.</p>
      <p>Two points from a possible 12, before the Saints came to town, had left fans teetering on the brink of mutiny – or, even worse, apathy.</p>
      <p>Noticeably, there were no chants in support of Emery, no ringing endorsements of his leadership from the posh seats (they are all posh seats at the Emirates).</p>

      <h3>Xhaka is a symptom, not the problem</h3>
      <p>Ever since Granit Xhaka was hounded out of the 2-2 draw with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> last month, Arsenal's fortunes have not improved.</p>
      <p>Despite Emery's pre-match hints that his captain would be phased back into the first team picture, Xhaka was not in the 18-man matchday squad – but his absence did not remove the toxic atmosphere swirling around the Emirates when Arsenal fell behind early.</p>
      <p>Picking your captain by conducting a dressing room poll always smacked of a cop-out, a manager shirking his responsibility to make a fundamental decision.</p>
      <p>Xhaka's removal from the firing line may not have turned him into a martyr, but he was an expedient scapegoat.</p>

      <h3>No sympathy, just apathy</h3>
      <p>By unpopular demand, empty red seats are back in fashion at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>The abundance of no-shows was not surprising, given Arsenal's spluttering autumn form, and it was by no means as conspicuous as the half-empty arena which greeted Arsene Wenger's team during the vicious cold snap of March 2018.</p>
      <p>But empty seats is never a healthy sign for a Gunners manager under pressure – because every unoccupied place is an expression of apathy, a statement that shopping at IKEA or staying at home is preferable to watching average players in an average team coached by an unloved manager.</p>

      <h3>Arsenal need more Pepe</h3>
      <p>Anaemic and disjointed for 45 minutes, Arsenal's performance was galvanised immediately by the half-time introduction of record signing Nicolas Pepe.</p>
      <p>When you pay £72 million for a winger, instead of meeting the asking price for Wilfried Zaha, you are entitled to get some bang for your bucks.</p>
      <p>And Pepe's arrival in place of Calum Chambers immediately signalled a change of gear, with the Gunners showing more urgency. Pepe's scissor-kick, which bounced down and against the bar, was desperately close to only his second Premier League goal of the season.</p>
      <h3>Saints staying alive</h3>
      <p>If <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> boss Ralph Hasenhuttl was on borrowed time after that record nine-goal mauling by <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> , this performance must have earned him a stay of execution.</p>
      <p>Saints pressed high, they pressed hard, they committed men forward and bravery brought its rewards.</p>
      <p>Their 'game management' – yes, that means timewasting – was transparently obvious, but the stats don't lie: They had more shots, better chances and, for long periods, they were better than Arsenal.</p>
