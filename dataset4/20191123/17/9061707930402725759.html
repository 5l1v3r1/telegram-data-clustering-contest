      <p>Phillip Cocu was delighted with <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby County</a>'s performance in their 1-0 victory over Preston North End this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Substitute <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-player-ratings-preston-forsyth-3571274">Martyn Waghorn</a> scored the only goal after 33 minutes of the Championship fixture at Pride Park Stadium.</p>
      <p>"I think we played very well - the best 45 minutes I have seen (from us)," Cocu said.</p>
      <p>"The last 15 minutes was more about getting the 1-0 win because we could not get that second goal.</p>
      <p>"But the way we wanted to start, the tactics, worked - a great job.</p>
      <p>"The only disappointment was we did not get more goals.</p>
      <p>"If you get that second goal the belief is there and it is very hard for Preston to come back into the game."</p>
      <p>This was Derby's fifth consecutive home win and they have moved up to 11th.</p>
