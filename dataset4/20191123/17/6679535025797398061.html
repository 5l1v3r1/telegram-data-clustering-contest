      <p>Human Rights Forum has condemned cases against the editor of <i>Veekshanam</i> journal N. Venugopal and member of Revolutionary Writers’ Association (Virasam) Kasim, under the UAPA (Unlawful Activities Prevention Act) and the Telangana Public Security Act.</p>
      <p>The report submitted by the police to the court with regard to the cases provided wrong details, and cited them as absconding, HRF alleged in a press release here on Saturday. Their names have been clubbed with others arrested on allegations of having ties with banned CPI (Maoist). All these facts point to a conspiracy by Telangana police, as both the intellectuals are being critical about government and its policies. The cases amount to repression of their freedom of expression.</p>
      <p>HRF has, through the press note, demanded withdrawal of cases againt Mr. Venugopal and Prof. Kasim, besides release of all leaders of people’s organisations forthwith.</p>
