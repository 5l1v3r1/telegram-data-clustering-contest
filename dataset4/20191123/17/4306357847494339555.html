      <h3>Piers Morgan took to social media to call for Unai Emery to be sacked as Arsenal were held to a 2-2 draw by Southampton in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon.</h3>
      <p>The Gunners dropped important points once again as their struggles under the Spanish head coach continued at The Emirates.</p>
      <p>Danny Ings gave the visitors the lead but Alexandre Lacazette equalised for the home side in the 18th minute.</p>
      <p>James Ward-Prowse then netted in the 71st minute to put the visitors ahead once again as the Saints closed in on a famous victory in north London.</p>
      <p>However, Lacazette netted a late equaliser for Emery’s men in the 96th minute to rescue a point for the Gunners and prevent the defeat.</p>
      <p>Celebrity Arsenal fan Morgan has been vocal about Arsenal’s poor form under Emery in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>And the former <i>Daily Mirror</i> editor was clearly not happy about the situation at the north London club as he posted a series of tweets after Arsenal had fallen behind during the game.</p>
      <p>With Arsenal trailing 2-1, Morgan <a href="https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/1198279001703366656">tweeted</a>: “Arsenal are losing 1-2 at home to a side that recently lost 0-9 to Leicester at their own stadium. Words temporarily fail me, which may give a clue as to the gravity of the situation.”</p>
      <p>As the clock ticked down, he <a href="https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/1198279174504534016">added</a>: “Does anyone have Pochettino’s number?”</p>
      <p>And finally, tweeting just before Arsenal’s equaliser, Morgan wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/1198282333067108352">Twitter</a>: “This can’t go on. #EmeryOut.”</p>
      <p>The win left Arsenal in seventh place in the Premier League table and with just four wins from their opening 13 games in the top flight this season.</p>
      <p>They will return to top-flight action with a trip to Norwich City next weekend.</p>
