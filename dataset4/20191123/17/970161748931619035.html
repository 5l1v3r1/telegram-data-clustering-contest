      <p>Beck has shut down claims he’s a Scientologist despite identifying as one back in 2005.</p>
      <p>The singer opened up about his faith recently, when chatting to Saturday’s <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/culture/music/workaholic-beck-i-feel-a-little-guilty-if-something-s-too-easy-20191118-p53bnh.html">The Sydney Morning Herald.</a></p>
      <p>And while his father David Campbell practices the religion, it turns out the Loser hitmaker does not.</p>
      <p>Talking to the publication, he explained: ‘I think there’s a misconception that I am a Scientologist. I’m not a Scientologist.</p>
      <p>‘My father has been a Scientologist for a long time, but I’ve pretty much just focused on my music and my work for most of my life, and tended to do my own thing.’</p>

      <p>The 49-year-old added: ‘I think it’s just something people ran with.’</p>
      <p>Almost 15 years ago, the star spoke about his beliefs to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100915054237/http://www.tribune.ie/article/2005/jun/12/a-sort-of-homecoming/">Irish Sunday Tribune,</a> where he openly confessed he’s a Scientologist.</p>

      <p>The star said: ‘Yeah, I’m a Scientologist. My father has been a Scientologist for about 35 years, so I grew up in and around it and stuff.’</p>
      <p>He then went onto describe what that means, adding: ‘What it actually is is just sort of, you know, I think it’s about philosophy.</p>

      <p>‘And sort of, all these kinds of, you know, ideals that are common to a lot of religions.’</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/02/15/beck-divorce-marissa-ribisi/">TMZ claimed that Beck had filed a divorce from his wife Marissa</a>, after almost 15 years of marriage.</p>
      <p>The duo share two children together, son Cosmo Henri, 14, and daughter Tuesday, 11.</p>
      <p>It’s thought they tied the knot in 2004, when the mother-of-two was pregnant with their first child.</p>
      <p>At the time it was claimed that they said their vows at San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito, California</p>
      <p>This was the same iconic location that Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow wed.</p>
