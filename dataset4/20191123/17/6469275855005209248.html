        <b>Skinny, curly and crimped fries might seem all the rage, but a classic straight cut, served piping hot, is still the chip of choice - with Maris Piper the most popular potato.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ‘perfect chip’ should be precisely 7cm long and 1.2cm wide - straight cut - crispy on the outside and soft in the middle.</p>

      <p>Brits believe chips should have a sprinkle of salt - no pepper - with ketchup considered the best topping (49 per cent), followed closely by vinegar (47 per cent) and mayonnaise (32 per cent).</p>
      <p>Curry sauce is crowned the winner over gravy or cheese, with one fifth of Brits not considering their chips to be perfect without it.</p>

      <p>The study of 2,000 adults, by the Food Advisory Board, also found those in the south remain loyal to curry sauce while people in the north prefer gravy.</p>

      <p>Only East Anglia and the South West residents opt for cheesy chips instead.</p>
      <p>It also emerged 40 per cent agreed chips are their favourite food, and a quarter admit that they would eat them for every meal if they could.</p>
      <p>Food Advisory Board expert Professor Robert Pickard said: “When the skin is left on, and they are prepared and cooked the right way, for example in the oven with minimal added fat, chips can be included in a healthy, balanced diet.</p>
      <p>"When cooking up chips, it’s best to opt for thick-cut potatoes as opposed to thinly cut chips, so that you avoid absorbing too much cooking fat."</p>
      <p>While some see chips as a treat, when looking at the nutritional value of potatoes, spuds with the skin on are actually a source of potassium, fibre and thiamin.</p>
      <p>But the study, conducted via OnePoll, found just under half recognise that potatoes with the skin on are a source of fibre.</p>
      <p>Only one third noted they are a source of potassium, and just one quarter knew they were low in sugar.</p>
      <p>Robert Pickard added: "Potato wedges can be a healthy way to cook potatoes, by ensuring you keep the skin on, and baking them in a small amount of unsaturated oil, such as rapeseed oil it will help maintain the potatoes nutrients.</p>
      <p>"Wedges are also very versatile, simply throw them in a tray bake with some lean meat and veggies for a healthy and balanced dinner time dish.”</p>
