      <p>Chris Wood, Ashley Barnes and James Tarkowski sent Watford bottom of the Premier League as Burnley bruised their way to a 3-0 victory at Vicarage Road.</p>
      <p>Wood’s snap finish, Barnes’ penalty and Tarkowski’s late strike condemned struggling Watford to a club-record 11th straight home league match without a win.</p>
      <p>Barnes’ penalty was awarded after a VAR check, with Jose Holebas judged to have brought the 30-year-old down in the area.</p>
      <p>The former Brighton forward then put away the spot-kick he had won, securing a win to send Burnley sixth in the table – and Watford bottom.</p>

      <p>Tarkowski’s late goal twisted the knife on Watford’s wounds, the Hornets’ chief tormentor ending an error-strewn, aggressive afternoon with the last laugh.</p>
      <p>While Burnley were left to toast a fifth win for the term, Quique Sanchez Flores’ stunned Watford could only limp away, as Norwich’s win and Southampton’s draw sent them bottom.</p>
      <p>Burnley’s delirious fans chanted “anti-football” to their hearts’ content as Sean Dyche’s men pulled off another smash-and-grab victory, leaving Watford floored both on the pitch and in the table.</p>
      <p>Both sides spent the first quarter of this clash desperately trying to convince themselves they were up for the fight, amid a miserable afternoon of dank and drizzly skies.</p>

      <p>Burnley came to frustrate and niggle, perfectly happy to circle in a holding pattern, for the first half at least.</p>
      <p>Eventually Watford decided the greater quality on the ball was theirs, and chief among those probing raiders was Deulofeu.</p>
      <p>As the skies darkened and Burnley’s mood followed suit thanks to a hefty error count, so Deulofeu sharpened up in contrast.</p>
      <p>Only a goal remained elusive from a promising second-quarter showing, though his strongest chance ending in a tame low shot that Nick Pope handled easily.</p>

      <p>The defender was forced out of an increasingly physical half, in which Tarkowski twice found himself caught cold by Deulofeu.</p>
      <p>The second time Tarkowski’s clumsy foul gifted the former Barcelona man a 25-yard free-kick, only for Pope to palm away his dipping effort.</p>
      <p>Burnley duly escaped to the break locked in a stalemate as glorious to them as it was galling for their hosts – and after the restart the Clarets plundered a little-deserved lead.</p>
      <p>Adrian Mariappa’s smart header denied Ben Mee a clear run to nod into the net, but from the resulting corner Burnley pounced.</p>

      <p>Tarkowski climbed above Holebas to scramble a header back across goal and Wood hooked home a left-footed shot to sting the Hornets.</p>
      <p>That chief pest Tarkowski then upended Etienne Capoue on the edge of the Burnley area, with a posse of Clarets players racing in to crowd referee Paul Tierney.</p>
      <p>Ashley Westwood was booked for prolonged dissent, and then Capoue skied the free-kick.</p>
      <p>As the former Spurs midfielder beat the turf to encapsulate the Watford frustration, Westwood harangued Tierney again.</p>
      <p>This time his captain Mee even shoved him away from the official, and the midfielder escaped further sanction.</p>

      <p>Cue a rendition of “no one likes us we don’t care” from the Burnley fans, revelling in their team’s wind-up merchant status.</p>
      <p>Just when Watford thought they could scrambled an equaliser though, Burnley stole the game.</p>
      <p>Jay Rodriguez hit the bar with a long-range chip as Watford wobbled again, then Barnes converted that VAR-awarded spot-kick, to kill the tie.</p>
      <p>And when Tarkowski drilled home at the second attempt, Watford’s ignominious afternoon was complete.</p>
