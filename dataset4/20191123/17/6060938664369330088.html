      <p>LONDON: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/premier-league">Premier League</a> leaders Liverpool extended their unbeaten run to 30 games after a late goal by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Roberto-Firmino">Roberto Firmino</a> gave them a scrappy 2-1 win at Crystal Palace on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Firmino struck from close range in the 85th minute, shortly after <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Wilfried-Zaha">Wilfried Zaha</a> cancelled out Sadio Mane's opener for the visitors who looked toothless in the first half with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mohamed-Salah">Mohamed Salah</a> on the bench nursing a sore ankle.</p>
      <p>Liverpool stayed top on 37 points from 13 games, eight ahead of Leicester City who beat Brighton and Hove Albion 2-0.</p>
      <p>Jordan Ayew and Gary Cahill missed chances for Palace before the home side had a 43rd-minute effort ruled out after a VAR check, with the replay showing Ayew pushed Dejan Lovren before James Tomkins headed the ball in at the far post.</p>
      <p>The visitors looked sharper immediately after the break, with Mane firing wide before he netted a 49th-minute goal with a scrambled shot which goalkeeper Vicente Guaita got a hand to but could not keep the ball out.</p>
      <p>Zaha equalised in the 82nd with a crisp low shot from 12 metres, only for Firmino to tuck the ball away from close range after Palace failed to clear the danger from a goalmouth scramble.</p>
