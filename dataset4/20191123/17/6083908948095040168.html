      <h1>Liar, Liar: Warren Says Her Kids Went to Public School Even Though They Went to an Expensive Private School</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:37:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://townhall.com/author/bethbaumann" target="_blank">Beth Baumann</a></address>
      <p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-MA) has continually taken aim at parents having a say in what school their child attends. What's ironic, however, is Warren doesn't want parents who send their kids to public school to decide where their child is sent but Warren herself made the choice to send her kids to an elite private school in Texas.</p>
      <p>School choice advocates confronted Warren about the issue on Thursday. And Warren lied directly to their faces, saying her kids went to public school.</p>
      <p>"We are going to have the same choice that you had for your kids because I read that your children went to private schools," Sarah Carpenter said when she confronted Warren in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
      <p>"My kids went to public school," Warren interjected.</p>
      <p>"I can't pack up and say I'm leaving behind and going to Germantown, that's our suburban area, because I can't afford it," Carpenter said. "My daughter can't afford it, so we want to make what we got great whether it's charter or traditional."</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://freebeacon.com/politics/video-warren-confronted-by-school-choice-activist-over-sending-son-to-private-school/">Washington Free Beacon</a>, a yearbook from 1987 shows Warren's son, Alex Warren, attended the Kirby Hall School in Austin as a fifth grader. During that same time frame, Warren was finishing up her last year as professor at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
      <p>What's amazing however, is Warren's communications director attempt at spinning the facts surrounding the senator's decision to send her kids to private school:</p>
      <p>From the Free Beacon:</p>
      <blockquote>"Elizabeth's daughter went to public school. Her son went to public school until 5th grade," Warren communications director Kristen Orthman told the <i>Washington Free Beacon</i>. "Elizabeth wants every kid to get a great education regardless of where they live, which is why her plan makes a historic investment in our public schools. Every public school should be a great school. Her plan does not affect funding for existing non-profit charter schools, but she believes we should not put public dollars behind a further expansion of charters until they are subject to the same accountability requirements as public schools."<br/><br/>Kirby Hall's lower school (grades K-5) currently <a href="https://www.kirbyhallschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tuition-and-Fee-Schedule-2019-2020-1.pdf">costs</a> nearly $15,000 in yearly tuition, with an additional $935-$1,870 charged for after school care. According to the <i>Austin American-Statesman</i>, Kirby Hall's tuition was $4,700 a year in 1995, the earliest record of the school's tuition costs reviewed by the <i>Washington Free Beacon</i>.</blockquote>
      <p>People like Warren upset the average middle class families because she's so quick to tell everyone else what they should want and need but she won't put herself or her family in those <i>exact</i> situations. It's hypocritical and really, it's the epitome of socialism and elitism.</p>
