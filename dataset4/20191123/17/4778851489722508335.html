        <b>A thrilling opening 15 minutes from Kilmarnock handed them a deserved 3-0 over struggling Hearts in the Ladbrokes Premiership.</b>
      </p>
      <p>If this was Austin MacPhee's audition for the permanent managerial role at Hearts then he failed miserably.</p>

      <p>Whilst undeniably being a good coach, his decision to start Aidy White in a left-midfield role proved disastrous as Kilmarnock raced to a three-goal lead within 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>Chris Burke rolled back the years with a virtuoso performance that wielded two goals and an assist. The 35 year-old winger opened the scoring on nine minutes when he fired high past Joel Periera after Mohamed El Makrini's well-timed pass.</p>
      <p>The outstanding Burke went from scorer to provider on 13 minutes when he produced a stunning pin-point cross for Eamonn Brophy to power a header past Periera.</p>
      <p>All three of Kilmarnock's early goals came down their right-hand side as youngster Aaron Hickey endured a terrible afternoon but with little support from the experienced White.</p>
      <p>The home side's third goal came directly from a Hearts corner as Killie counter-attacked at great pace before Burke weaved past Michael Smith and fired past Manchester United loanee Periera.</p>
      <p>It was a difficult watch for the travelling support as Hearts failed to respond to going three goals down and Burke continued to cause havoc, forcing Pereira into a comfortable save on 40 minutes.</p>
      <p>Steven Naismith, usually the influential heartbeat of this Hearts side when fit, struggled to make an impact after his goalscoring exploits for Scotland during the week.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, Hickey was replaced at the interval by Jake Mulraney as MacPhee tinkered with his formation to little effect.</p>
      <p>The visitors improved slightly immediately after half-time and had their best opportunities of the encounter through Clevid Dikamona. From two consecutive corners, the towering French defender went agonisingly close with headers.</p>
      <p>Kilmarnock were comfortable throughout the second half as Hearts lacked a cutting edge. Gary Dicker was a colossus for Kilmarnock with the captain deployed in his familiar central midfield role after deputising at centre half recently due to a defensive crisis.</p>
      <p>The hosts almost capped a perfect afternoon with a stunning team goal on 87 minutes. Alan Power clipped a lovely ball through to El Makirini who nonchalantly flicked the ball into the path of the onrushing Stephen O'Donnell and his goal bound half-volley was tipped over by Periera.</p>
