      <h3>Championship</h3>
      <p>Both West Brom and Leeds hit last-ditch winners as Preston dropped out of the automatic promotion spots on an afternoon of late drama.</p>
      <p>At the Hawthorns, Charlie Austin converted an 88th-minute penalty to keep <b>West Brom</b> top of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship">Championship</a>. Hal Robson-Kanu’s fourth goal in six games had given his side the lead against <b>Sheffield Wednesday</b>, but a Steven Fletcher penalty looked to have secured a point for the Owls until Matheus Pereira drew a foul in the box in the game’s final stages and Austin slammed home.</p>
      <p><b>Leeds</b> left it even later to seal a win of their own against <b>Luton Town</b>, Patrick Bamford’s sixth goal of the season drawing a reply in the form of James Collins’ bullet header. But Matt Pearson’s 90th-minute own-goal – again forced by Bamford – saw Leeds take the points. They move into second, leapfrogging <b>Preston</b> who came unstuck at <b>Derby County</b>, first-half substitute Martyn Waghorn making an immediate impact to fire home the winner.</p>
      <p><b>Swansea </b>fell to sixth with a home defeat to <b>Millwall</b>, Jed Wallace’s sublime free-kick making the difference, while <b>Nottingham Forest</b> shared the spoils with fellow promotion hopefuls <b>Bristol City</b>, Ryan Yates seeing red at Ashton Gate in a game full of chances but devoid of goals.</p>
      <p>At the other end of the table, rock-bottom <b>Barnsley</b> came out the losers from a seesawing game at <b>Blackburn</b>, Cauley Woodrow chesting home a late leveller only for Bradley Dack’s second goal of the game to clinch a win for the hosts, while <b>Stoke</b> took a valuable three points against imperilled <b>Wigan</b>, Mame Biram Diouf striking deep into stoppage-time to seal a 2-1 win.</p>
      <p><b>Huddersfield</b> remain within three points of the drop zone after <b>Birmingham</b>’s Marc Roberts cancelled out a well-taken goal from Frazier Campbell to leave the scores at 1-1.</p>

      <h3>League One</h3>
      <p>The leaders also left in late in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball">League One</a>, <b>Wycombe</b> snatching a late victory over 10-man <b>Doncaster </b>thanks to Joe Jacobsen’s 92nd-minute spot-kick, a win that extended their lead at the top to five points after <b>Ipswich</b> were held to a 2-2 draw at home to <b>Blackpool,</b> Jay Spearing and Luke Garbutt exchanging penalties after Joe Nuttall’s close-range finish had cancelled out Gwion Edwards’ opener.</p>
      <p><b>Coventry</b> also lost ground on the leaders with a 1-1 draw at <b>Sunderland</b>, Benjamin Mgunga-Kimpioka stealing a point for the hosts in the last minute after Dominic Hyam’s first-half header.</p>
      <p>Joe Ward’s injury-time strike gave third-placed <b>Peterborough</b> a 1-0 win over <b>Burton Albion</b>, while <b>MK Dons</b> gave up a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 at home to <b>Rotherham</b> to make it 10 defeats in 11. <b>AFC Wimbledon</b> put daylight between them and their loathed rivals with a nervy 1-0 win over <b>Gillingham</b>,<b> </b>Scott Wagstaff scoring the game’s only goal against his former club.</p>
      <p><b>Bolton</b>’s season of misery continued apace, losing 7-1 at <b>Accrington Stanley</b> and having to play most of the game with 10 men after Josh Earl’s early red card. They remain on one point, only four behind Sol Campbell’s <b>Southend</b>, who fell to a 4-0 defeat at home to <b>Oxford United</b> – they climb into the play-off places.</p>

      <h3>League Two</h3>
      <p><b>Swindon</b>’s retained their two-point lead at the top of the table, Eoin Doyle 17th goal in as many league games sealing a 1-0 win against <b>Mansfield</b>, and <b>Forest Green</b> stayed closely on their tales as an Ebou Adams double steered them towards a 4-2 victory at his former club <b>Leyton Orient</b>.</p>
      <p><b>Crewe</b> moved into the third automatic promotion spot, speeding into a three-goal half-time lead over 10-man <b>Morecambe</b> in a game that finished 5-0, while <b>Bradford</b> dropped to seventh after a 2-1 loss at <b>Plymouth</b>. <b>Exeter</b>’s 1-0 win at <b>Crawley</b> took them up to fourth in a congested table where seven points separate the top eight, while a Conor Thomas penalty rescued a 1-1 draw for <b>Cheltenham</b> at home to <b>Colchester</b> but could not prevent his side being overtaken by <b>Northampton</b>, who prevailed 2-0 over managerless <b>Grimsby</b>.</p>
      <p>A game that had the look of a six-pointer ended a point apiece, with neither <b>Walsall</b> nor <b>Stevenage</b> able to break the deadlock at the Bescot Stadium in a result that leaves the two sides third- and second-bottom respectively.</p>
