      <p>Two Derby pubs were closed on Saturday tea-time after reports of a police incident.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/chaddesden">Toby Carvery at Chaddesden</a> and the<a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/oakwood"> Oak and Acorn at Oakwood</a> were both shut.</p>
      <p>There were reports that other licensed premises across the Chaddesden area were also closed.</p>
      <p>There were claims that police, fire and ambulance had been called to The Toby Carvery, in Nottingham Road, and it had been evacuated.</p>
      <p>One witness posted a message just before 4pm which said: "Something big is cracking off now at Toby Carvery.</p>
      <p>"12 police cars, fire engine, ambulances, it's been evacuated, and there are loads of people outside all dressed up."</p>
      <p>A spokesman at the pub confirmed it was currently shut but could not give any further details.</p>
      <p>A second pub confirmed that it had closed.</p>
      <p>The Oak and Acorn Sizzling Pub and Grill in Danebridge Crescent, Oakwood, said it was currently shut and no one was available to say when it might reopen.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Derbyshire police said he was aware of no major incidents in the area.</p>
