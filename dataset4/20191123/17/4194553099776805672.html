      <h1>‘Perfect…’ Lucky Break…’ Many reds buzzing over Fabinho yellow card</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:32:29+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>Fabinho picked up a yellow card today v Crystal Palace, which now the match is over and we’ve won 2-1, was mighty smart!</p>
      <p>The Brazilian was one booking away from a suspension, which means he’ll miss the Brighton clash next Saturday.</p>
      <p>Considering we should be dominating at Anfield against the Seagulls, it’s probably the best game Fabinho could miss – especially considering it’s the Merseyside Derby a few days later.</p>
      <p>There is no way he got booked on purpose, and actually, Fabinho would have fouled Wilf Zaha in the buildup to Crystal Palace’s goal today – so it didn’t help us during the 90 minutes!</p>
      <p>But fans on Twitter are delighted Fab will have a breather at the weekend and return to the lineup on December 4.</p>
      <p>He’s arguably been our best player this season, although Sadio Mane and Virgil van Dijk have been sensational too.</p>

      <blockquote>fabinho missing the brighton game isnt the worst game in the world to miss as well<br/>— jk (@_JwK14) <a href="https://twitter.com/_JwK14/status/1198288601748004864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>When we talk about lucky breaks this season, Fabinho's suspension falling on Brighton at home right at the beginning of an absurd fixture list might rank up there.<br/>— 🖐☝️ (@BurtMacklinSOB) <a href="https://twitter.com/BurtMacklinSOB/status/1198288485536260096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>Fabinho now suspended for Brighton at home but we got the cover to handle it.<br/>— Nin Singh (@NinSingh888) <a href="https://twitter.com/NinSingh888/status/1198288326173872132?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>Brighton at home probably the one game you'd pick for Fabinho to miss out of the upcoming fixtures that Liverpool have. Could see Lallana getting another game as the 6.<br/>— Jack Sear (@JackSear) <a href="https://twitter.com/JackSear/status/1198286336865779712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>Perfect that Fabinho misses Brighton. Means he can play Everton, and the following game(s).<br/>— Fabinho is the name! 🇧🇷🔴 (@Patrickkk1997) <a href="https://twitter.com/Patrickkk1997/status/1198285644558163968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>The fixtures are coming really fast and there’s no let up really. We just have to keep trying to dig out wins, one game at a time, and get through to the new year still in a positive position. Fabinho getting a rest v Brighton is actually a silver lining also<br/>— Michael⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (@_MichaelPaul91_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_MichaelPaul91_/status/1198285047494840321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>
