      <h1>Crystal Palace having doubts over deal for Chelsea forward Olivier Giroud?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/crystal-palace/"><b>Crystal Palace</b></a> are allegedly considering ending their interest in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/"><b>Chelsea</b></a> forward <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/olivier-giroud/"><b>Olivier Giroud</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>Having fallen down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge, the 33-year-old is expected to be made available by the Blues during the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>However, according to the <i>Daily Mail</i>, the France international may price himself out of a move elsewhere if he keeps his current wage demands.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/inter-milan/"><b>Inter Milan</b></a> were said to be <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/transfer-talk/news/girouds-demands-too-high-for-inter-milan_380028.html">against signing Giroud on his current earnings</a> and handing the World Cup winner a two-and-a-half-year contract.</p>
      <p>The report adds that Palace share a similar view regarding the veteran, which could prompt the Eagles into switching their attention to other targets.</p>
      <p>Giroud has been limited to just one start and four substitute outings in all competitions this season.</p>
