      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> : Celebrity's Try Star have hinted they'll bare all and perform a <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/the-all-new-monty-2019">Full Monty</a> routine if they make it to the singing contest's final.</p>
      <p>The boy band - made up of rugby players <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ben-foden">Ben Foden</a> , 34, Levi Davis, 21, and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/thom-evans">Thom Evans</a> , 34 - have teased they'll strip off to "pay back" people for voting to get them into the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> final.</p>
      <p>The sporty hunks joked about their potential raunchy routine during an interview with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10407608/x-factor-celebritys-try-star-strip-naked-full-monty/">The Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>Rugby ace Ben admitted that showing a little skin has crossed his mind, saying: "I've definitely had a dream where I'm naked on stage and people are laughing at me and stuff."</p>

      <p>While Levi confirmed The Full Monty is definitely a potential way of 'paying back' voters.</p>
      <p>He said: "If you voted for us to get in the final, then I think we would pay you by a big performance. I don't know what that would be yet."</p>
      <p>Ben added: "Depends how well the performance is going. We've thought about it."</p>
      <p>The hunky boy band members are not strangers to getting their kit off after ripping their shirts off during many of their X Factor Celebrity performances.</p>

      <p>The band even attempted to get the audience members hot under the collar by stripping off in a sexy wet scene as they performed in the rain to X Ambassadors' 'Boom'.</p>
      <p>However, the risqu√© performance ended in laughter after hunky Levi got his vest tangled around his ankles.</p>
      <p>The star attempted to strip down to his trousers to showcase his toned six-pack but left viewers giggling as he failed to make the sexy move.</p>

      <p>The rugby stars also told the publication that the show "isn't purely about the singing" as they continue to impress viewers with their entertaining routines.</p>
      <p>The trio will take to the stage this weekend in <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> 's X Factor spin-off show as they take on semi-finals week.</p>
      <p>Recent reports have suggested that Try Star's performances were getting so sexy that show bosses were forced to step in and ban stripper poles from being used on stage.</p>
      <p>According to The Sun, Try Star were told to "cool down" their sex appeal in performances over fears they were becoming too sexy for live TV.</p>

      <p>The band's Magic Mike-inspired performances have certainly impressed stunning judge <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/nicole-scherzinger">Nicole Scherzinger</a> .</p>
      <p>Rumours have speculated that the TV judge, 41, has been wooed by band member Thom backstage.</p>
      <p>Thom recently fuelled their romance rumours by confessing that dating the star has "crossed his mind" following their flirty encounters.</p>
      <p>The contestant and the judge sparked speculation they were secretly involved after heading on a secret date night out together last week.</p>
