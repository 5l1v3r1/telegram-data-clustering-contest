      <h1>Hibs 3 Motherwell 1 as Jack Ross' tenure gets off to a winning start - 3 talking points</h1>
      <h2>Goals from Christian Doidge, Flo Kamberi and Daryl Horgan secured all three points for the home side.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:05:13+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:05</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Pilcher, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-pilcher/</a></address>
      <p>Mark Gillepsie had to look sharp within the first five minutes when <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-allan">Scott Allan</a> tried to find the bottom corner from distance, but the Motherwell keeper got down well to get strong wrists behind the Hibs man’s low drive.</p>
      <p>Despite that encouraging start, it was the visitors who then took the lead. Jermaine Hylton showed lovely skill to go by Vykintas Slivka on the left hand side before cutting back to Jake Carroll in the box. His low strike towards the back post took a slight deflection and struck in the inside of the woodwork, but fell perfectly for Liam Polworth to tap in to a virtually empty net.</p>
      <p>Jason Naismith then combined with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/florian-kamberi">Flo Kamberi</a> down the right, but Gillespie was equal to his angled attempt from the right hand side of the penalty area.</p>
      <p>An equaliser did arrive soon after on the 20 minute mark. Kamberi’s pass in behind put Joe Newell in. His effort beat Gillespie who had come out to narrow the angle, but may have been cleared had Chris Doidge not been on hand to make sure.</p>

      <p>Four minutes later, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> were ahead. A now customary Allan through ball allowed Naismith to cut back for Doidge. He was denied by a block, but the ball fell to Kamberi’s feet, and the Swiss showed good composure to delay his shot before smashing the ball past a helpless Gillespie.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a> then found themselves chasing the game. Carroll’s left foot strike should have been straightforward for Chris Maxwell, but he rather clumsily turned the ball round his near post.</p>
      <p>Allan, Kamberi and Doidge continued to link up well after the break. Allan fed Kamberi, who’s imaginative flick presented Doidge with a real chance to make it 3-1, but he shot straight at Gillespie.</p>
      <p>Motherwell then had what looked like a strong penalty claim turned down when Ryan Porteous got turned by Long and clumsily bundled him over, but John Beaton refused to award the spot-kick the visiting players were screaming for.</p>

      <p>Long was causing the Hibs back line problems, and then flashed a cross-come-shot across goal that only needed a touch. Hallberg was then robbed by Devante Cole in a dangerous position, but his shot lacked the power to trouble Maxwell.</p>
      <p>Just when it looked to be a nervy finish for the home fans, Hibs got the crucial third with just five minutes to go. A fine counter attack ended with Stevie Mallan feeding fellow sub Daryl Horgan, who sent a crisp finish across Gillespie.</p>
      <p>Mallan was then inches from scoring in identical fourth, but his strike came back off the inside of the post.</p>

      <h3>Three talking points</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Two up front works</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chris Doidge added to his hat-trick last time out while Flo Kamberi put Hibs ahead, and each was involve din the build up to the other’s goal. Doidge looks more effective with a partner to link with, while it also gives Scott Allan behind them more options.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Defensive work to do</b>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps as a result of a more attacking approach, Hibs still don’t look as solid as they’d like to at the back. Motherwell had a lot of joy in particular down the flanks. More then once Jason Naismith and Lewis Stevenson were found wanting up against fast, tricky opponents.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Positivity from the stands</b>
      </p>
      <p>Had this game been a month ago, it could have been long last 15 minutes with Hibs attempting to hold on to a lead. Paul Heckingbottom suggested the nervousness from the stands contributed to Hibs throwing points away before. This time however, the encouragement came when it was needed, with some rousing renditions of songs not heard at Easter Road for more than a few weeks.</p>
