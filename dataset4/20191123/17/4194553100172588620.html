      <h1>What Liverpool need to do to beat Mourinho &amp; Wenger records</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:50:03+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool’s win today means we haven’t been beaten in 30 Premier League games – the third longest unbeaten run in the history of the competition.</p>
      <p>The only sides with a longer streak are the infamous Arsenal Invincibles team, who went 49 without defeat under Arsene Wenger, and Chelsea under Jose Mourinho, who went 40.</p>
      <p>Both those legendary Premier League teams won the title – so it’s up to Jurgen Klopp’s Reds to join them.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Opta tweeted the stat after our 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>30 – Liverpool are unbeaten in 30 Premier League matches (W25 D5); only Arsenal (49 games in October 2004) and Chelsea (40 in October 2005) have ever had longer runs without defeat in the history of the competition. Limit. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CRYLIV?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CRYLIV<br/></a>— OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) <a href="https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/1198287408552394752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>We face Brighton next weekend, without the suspended Fabinho, but will hopefully have Mo Salah, who remained on the bench today, available.</p>
      <p>After the Seagulls it’s Everton – with it unsure who’ll be in charge of our local rivals with Marco Silva’s job on the line…</p>
      <p>After the Derby, we face Bournemouth, Watford, Leicester and Wolves before the New Year.</p>
      <p>Klopp will have to rotate and use his entire squad, but the mentality which is consistently shown by everybody displays we can win every game, even if we’re losing with ten minutes to go.</p>
