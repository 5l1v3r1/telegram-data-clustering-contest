      <p>This week, Nigerian star DaVido touched down with his <i>A Good Time</i> third studio album, recruiting a slew of collaborators to help deliver the full body of work. Among those features was a look from Summer Walker, who appeared on the project's "D&amp;G" track, co-produced by London on Da Track and Kiddominant.</p>
      <p>The song arrives as a smooth offering that finds DaVido's expressive vocals balanced by Walker's relatively muted tones. It makes for an appropriate addition among heavy-hitters that include <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/ChrisBrown/profile">Chris Brown</a>, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/popcaan/profile">Popcaan</a>, <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tags/gunna/">Gunna</a>, <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/a-boogie-wit-da-hoodie/profile/">A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie</a>, and Naira Marley among others.</p>
