      <p>The hashtag #GameofThrones started trending on Twitter on Saturday as netizens started comparing BJP's midnight 'coup' in Maharashtra to the American fantasy drama TV series on the power play created by David Benioff and DB Weiss.</p>
      <p>In a surprising development, BJP's Devendra Fadnavis earlier this morning took oath as the Maharashtra Chief Minister for the second consecutive term while Ajit Pawar took oath as Deputy Chief Minister of the state. The oath was administered by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari at Raj Bhawan.</p>
      <p>The move came at a time when deliberations between Congress, NCP, and Shiv Sena on government formation seemed to have reached the final stage on Friday.</p>
      <p>Soon after the swearing-in ceremony, users started flooding Twitter with memes comparing Maharashtra scenario with the HBO series 'Game Of Thrones'. </p>
