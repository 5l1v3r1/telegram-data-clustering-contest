      <h1>Thanksgiving weather: Snow, wind could snarl travel in central, eastern USA as 55M clog roads, airports</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:09:52+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/" target="_blank">Doug Stanglin, USA TODAY</a></address>
      <p>Like 55-million holiday travelers, a sprawling winter storm is expected to be on the move in the run-up to Thanksgiving, bringing the threat of snow, rain, strong winds — and major travel headaches — to central and eastern sections of the country.</p>
      <p>Wintry conditions are expected not only to delay travelers on icy, crowded Interstates, but also disrupt air travel with strong, gusty winds at key airports.</p>
      <p>"At this time, enough snow to create winterlike travel is anticipated from central and northeastern Colorado to much of Nebraska, northern Kansas, much of Iowa, northwestern Missouri, northwestern Illinois, southeastern Minnesota, central and eastern Wisconsin and northern Michigan," <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/winter-weather/pre-thanksgiving-storm-to-dish-out-disruptive-snow-wind-rain-along-1800-mile-corridor-of-us/632684">AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Brett Anderson said</a>.</p>
      <p>Forecasters expect Tuesday into Wednesday to bring the worst conditions in the Midwest, with strong, gusty winds battering such key airports as Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.</p>

      <p>AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said winds are expected to increase around the eastern Great Lakes and become strong and gusty over much of the Northeast from Wednesday afternoon into Thanksgiving Day</p>
      <p>He said winds are likely to  hit 40-50 mph with, locally higher gusts possible, and "could end up being very disruptive to travel in the region."</p>
      <p>Depending on the storm's midweek track, the frontal system on Wednesday will likely bring rain along the Interstate 95 corridor in the mid-Atlantic, with snow expected in parts of the Great Lakes and interior Northeast, <a href="https://weather.com/forecast/national/news/2019-11-22-thanksgiving-weather-forecast-travel-2019">according to The Weather Channel</a>.</p>
      <p>AAA says the 55 million who plan to go at least 50 miles or more from home for Thanksgiving mark an increase of 2.9% over last year — the second largest number since the association began keeping tabs in 2000.</p>
      <p>For the 49.3 million people traveling by automobile, major delays should peak on Wednesday with trips taking as much four times longer as commuters mix with travelers, according to INRIX, a global transportation analytics company that partners with AAA to compile holiday travel data.</p>
      <p>A separate storm could also bring coastal rain and mountain snow to the Pacific Northwest both on Wednesday and on Thanksgiving Day. </p>
      <p>Across the southern tier of the country, rain is expected from California to Georgia on Wednesday, with potential delays on the travel corridors.</p>
