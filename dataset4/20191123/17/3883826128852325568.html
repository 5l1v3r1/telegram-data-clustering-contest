        <b>England scored 10 tries as they crushed Italy 60-3 in Bedford to complete a clean sweep of victories from their autumn internationals.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Red Roses' driving maul and scrum were imperious throughout, with Vicky Fleetwood, Poppy Cleall and Heather Kerr going over from close range in the first 25 minutes.</p>
      <p>Abby Dow beat two players to score and see England go in 22-3 up, with world player of the year Emily Scarratt surging through a gap to add a fifth try.</p>
      <p>As weather conditions worsened hooker Kerr muscled over for the second time, with a penalty try adding to scores from replacements Amy Cokayne, Rownita Marston and Sarah Bern.</p>
      <p>Italy - who finished second to Grand Slam winners England in this year's Six Nations - showed short spells of resistance in the first half but looked a beaten side after the break.</p>
      <p>Simon Middleton's side, meanwhile, finish the year with 12 wins from 13 games and extend their run of victories on home soil - now up to 17.</p>
      <h3>Red Roses end 2019 with a flourish</h3>
      <p>In front of a 5,000 capacity crowd at Goldington Road - home of men's Championship side Bedford Blues - England made five changes to the side that edged past France in Exeter last weekend.</p>
      <p>The Red Roses' opening three tries all came via lineout mauls before Dow finished off a fine move in the right corner with arguably the try of the match to close the first half.</p>
      <p>Rain poured down during the second half but England were persistent as the Italians tired on an increasingly heavy surface.</p>
      <p>Scarrett showed agility to cut back through a gap to dive over, while referee Hollie Davidson sin-binned Lucia Cammarano and gave England a penalty try as the visitors could not live with the physicality of their opponents.</p>
      <p>Having made her England debut off the bench last week, Marston came on to score her first international try before fellow replacement Bern took the hosts into double figures.</p>
      <p>England - ranked second in the world - will return to action in February as they begin their Six Nations defence.</p>

        <b>England head coach Simon Middleton told BBC Sport:</b>
      </p>
      <p>"I thought we played exceptionally well in really tough conditions.</p>
      <p>"When you play a team you know you could dominate it's easy to go away from your gameplan and struggle with your basics, but we executed well and stuck to our plan brilliantly.</p>
      <p>"I thought we were ruthless in how we played and there were some really good individual performances."</p>
      <p>
        <b>England forward Sarah Bern told BBC Sport:</b>
      </p>
      <p>"It was good to see how we wore them down - Italy are always a great side to come out against.</p>
      <p>"Coming on we just needed to inject a bit of energy and I think that's exactly what our bench did.</p>
      <p>"We're in a fantastic place. We've got some new people in the squad, we've tried all our different combinations and I think we're in a great place after three wins."</p>
