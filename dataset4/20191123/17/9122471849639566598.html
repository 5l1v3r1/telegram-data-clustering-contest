      <h1>Photo: Tua Tagovailoa Shares Heartfelt Picture With Nick Saban</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:04:15+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>When Tua Tagovailoa went down with a hip injury last weekend, there were <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/nick-saban-tua-tagovailoa-injury-blame-marcus-spears">many people blaming Nick Saban</a> for keeping his star quarterback in the game despite being up by a wide margin.</p>
      <p>Saban admit that Tagovailoa was going to practice the two-minute drill on the final drive of the first half. It unfortunately resulted in the dual-threat quarterback suffering a dislocated hip.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa already underwent surgery and is expected to make a full recovery. Nonetheless, all the critics that blamed Saban for the injury haven’t changed their stance.</p>
      <p>Regardless of all the negativity surrounding Alabama’s head coach, it’s pretty apparent that he’s still on great terms with Tagovailoa.</p>
      <p>Prior to kickoff between Alabama and Western Carolina, Tagovailoa shared a heartwarming photo with Saban.</p>
      <p>Check it out:</p>

      <p>Tagovailoa also <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/tua-tagovailoa-has-message-for-fans-before-alabama-game">shared a message to Alabama fans</a> this morning, telling them to come out and support the seniors making their final appearance at Bryant-Denny Stadium.</p>
      <p>It’s disappointing that Tagovailoa won’t have the chance to finish this season with the Crimson Tide. He’s put together a remarkable career in Tuscaloosa, and if he elects to declare for the 2020 NFL Draft, he’ll finish as one of the best players to ever suit up for the program.</p>
