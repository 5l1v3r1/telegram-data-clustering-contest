      <p>As Bolton School’s nursery class have been studying a new topic Into The Dark..., the three and four year olds have enjoyed learning about nocturnal animals, and in particular hedgehogs.</p>
      <p>Last year, the children adopted Chorley Hedgehog Rescue Centre as one of the charities they support and using their new-found knowledge, they thought this would be an ideal time to donate to them again.</p>
      <p>John Newbould, head of marketing at Bolton School, said: “Families generously collected kitten food, blankets and newspapers for the rescue centre, and Simone Sweeney, from the Chorley Hedgehog Rescue Centre, visited to collect the donations.</p>
      <p>“She also spoke to the children about all the fabulous and important work they do for very young and sick hedgehogs.”</p>
      <p>Chorley Hedgehog Rescue Centre is dedicated to the preservation and rehabilitation of hedgehogs.</p>
