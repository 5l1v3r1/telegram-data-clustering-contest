      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> campmate <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> has already spilled a few secrets about her family life – but we are hoping she reveals more.</p>
      <p>And according to psychic Chris Riley, the 70-year-old won’t share too much, but he believes she will talk about her marriage to Kris Jenner.</p>
      <p>‘Jacqueline Jossa might have expressed her love for the Kardashians, but Caitlyn won’t open up about them fully just yet. I don’t see her sharing any special secrets on the series,’ Chris began.</p>
      <p>‘She is very respectful of her family and personal life. I feel she’s already discussed with her family the things that they’d prefer her not to discuss, especially with regards to their relationships and personal lives.’</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘I do think that she may open up about her marriage to Kris Jenner, but it won’t be to get sympathy, nor will she “bad mouth” her. I think it’ll be general conversation as she opens up to her campmates.</p>

      <p>‘I feel that there may be some tensions within the Kardashian clan.  Luckily for them, Caitlyn understands that she needs to keep some things private. I don’t think she’ll go into detail on mainstream TV.’</p>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/im-celebrity-fans-convinced-caitlyn-jenner-let-slip-kylie-pregnant-11203905/">So far Caitlyn has opened up about being a father to her children Kylie and Kendall Jenner</a> as she discussed with her fellow campmates about being a parent, when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway/">Kate Garraway</a> candidly asked her what her children called her.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn responded: ‘My kids all call me dad, Kendall asked me first and I said “dad”, I’m your dad and I’ll always be your dad ’til the day I die.</p>
      <p>‘But what they’re really good at which shocks me all the time is when they’re talking about me, “my dad, she” and it’s tough to change the pronoun in the middle of it.’</p>
