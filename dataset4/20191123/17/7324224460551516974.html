      <p>The Labour leader defended his decision to adopt a neutral stance in a future Brexit referendum as “a sign of maturity”.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said: “I think being an honest broker and listening to everyone is actually a sign of strength and a sign of maturity.”</p>
      <p>He added that he believes his position is “a sensible way forward that can bring people together”.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Members of the other parties criticised Mr Corbyn’s Brexit position</b>

      <p>Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson branded Mr Corbyn a “bystander” on Brexit after his pledge to take a neutral stance in another EU referendum.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson said Mr Corbyn’s decision to remain neutral was “astonishing” and accused him of showing “an absence of leadership”.</p>
      <p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock added that Mr Corbyn’s stance “won’t wash” with voters.</p>

      <p>The Tories promised to double dementia research funding over the next decade by putting an extra £83 million a year into the cause.</p>
      <p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that as well as increasing spending the Conservatives would “double” government research and work to “galvanise” scientists and research companies.</p>
      <p>The plans would see more than £1.6 billion invested over the next decade to find a cure for dementia, and would be spent on increasing the number of clinical research academics and researchers studying innovative techniques.</p>

      <p>Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson called for creative and arts subjects to get “the same footing as the rest of the curriculum”.</p>
      <p>In their manifesto, the party said it would spend £10 billion a year more on schools by 2024-25 and employ 20,000 extra teachers, including in creative subjects.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson said a Liberal Democrat government would “reverse the trend of creativity being squeezed out of the classroom” and would create an independent, expert-led body to pilot and phase in future curriculum changes in all state schools with input from teachers.</p>
