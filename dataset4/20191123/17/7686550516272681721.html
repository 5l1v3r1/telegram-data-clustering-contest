      <p>Steve Cooper admits Swansea City will struggle to win matches this season if they replicate the performance levels they showed in the 1-0 loss to Millwall.</p>
      <p>The Swans went into the clash with Gary Rowett's side unbeaten in their last three outings, claiming seven points from their fixtures with Cardiff City, Wigan Athletic and Sheffield Wednesday.</p>
      <p>But they produced a lacklustre display against the Lions who claimed <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/swansea-city-millwall-jed-wallace-17301727">their first away Championship win of the season</a> thanks to Jed Wallace's stunning 65th minute free-kick.</p>
      <p>And Swansea head coach Cooper admits his troops fell well below the levels required against Millwall.</p>

      <p>"We certainly fell short, that’s for sure," he said.</p>
      <p>"We always look at ourselves first and foremost, and we all know we were not at the level today in any area of the pitch, truth be told. It’s a disappointing day.</p>
      <p>"It’s difficult to pay too much attention to form because this league is so indifferent week in and week out.</p>
      <p>"The players know too many parts of our game were not where they should have been in terms of performance levels.</p>
      <p>"If you do that – unless you are really lucky and get away with it – you will not win games."</p>
      <p>It was Swansea's fourth league defeat of the campaign, with each of those coming at the Liberty Stadium.</p>
      <p>Cooper's men are also without a win in their first match after an international break this term.</p>
      <p>However, despite the poor return of points on home soil, Cooper does not believe his side's home struggled have put added pressure on the players.</p>

      <p>"It’s not a good return, those four losses. We know that, but I don’t think it’s about momentum or there being any added pressure. We just did not play well," he added.</p>
      <p>"When we did have moments and we did not capitalise on them, and we have conceded a disappointing goal. So, lots of things accumulated into it being a poor performance.</p>
      <p>"We have got to be good at dealing with what comes our way and we work to make sure we have solutions.</p>
      <p>"They put a lot of bodies around their box, but we have good enough players to play through and around that, but we did not do that.</p>
      <p>“If you do not do that you will not create chances and score goals."</p>
      <p>Swansea return to action against Huddersfield Town at the John Smith's Stadium on Tuesday night before hosting Fulham at the Liberty Stadium three days later.</p>
