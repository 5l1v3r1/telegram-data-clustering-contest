      <h1>Ballarat Grammar students ditch traditional schoolies trip to help rebuild a Himalayan school</h1>

      <p>Just hours after their valedictory dinner to celebrate the end of 13 years of schooling, a group of Ballarat Grammar students will take flight to the top of the world to use their muscle and help rebuild a Nepalese school.</p>
      <p>The group of 17 students have ditched traditional schoolies celebrations at the Gold Coast, Bali, Surf Coast or other locations, to travel to Nepal and help rebuild a school badly damaged in the devastating 2015 earthquake.</p>
      <p>It's the continuation of a link the school has had over the past few years with the remote town of Bupsa, in the Khumbu Valley.</p>

      <p>The town's school was destroyed in the April 2015 earthquake, and former Ballarat Grammar students Charlie and Hamish Rose stumbled on the town and its rebuild when they were trekking in Nepal several years ago.</p>
      <p>"While trekking in the Khumbu Valley, one of the ways in to Everest, they came across the village a bit off the main tourist trail. They pitched in and helped reconstruct the school so between their efforts and a number of donations over the years from Ballarat Grammar and the Himalayan Trust, little by little the school is getting better," said teacher Paul Esmonde who is heading the trip.</p>
      <p>Ballarat Grammar Junior School raised $10,000 to fund the rebuilding of the school, which was completed in 2017.</p>

      <p>Charlie Rose, who will be one of the leaders on this trip, approached Ballarat Grammar headmaster Adam Heath about doing something further to support the village, and the 'alternative schoolies' trip was developed with World Challenge.</p>
      <p>"It's about creating something genuine and memorable to finish our school careers," said Angus, one of the teens making the trip.</p>
      <p>During their four days in Bupsa, the students will build a rock wall fence and retaining wall around the Buksa Basic School, and funds they have raised throughout the year will also contribute toward school uniforms, sports and educational supplies.</p>

      <p>Mr Esmonde said the group would fly in to Kathmandu and spend a few days in cultural briefings, learning some Nepalese, understanding religious expectations, learning to cook and how to be a sensitive tourist.</p>
      <p>They will then fly to Lukla, high in the Himalayas, before a two-day hike to get to isolated Bupsa where they will stay with local families.</p>

      <p>It will be a quick turnaround for the year 12 group, who packed their bags yesterday, had their valedictory dinner last night and had to be at school at 5.30am this morning to catch a bus to Melbourne Airport for their departure.</p>
