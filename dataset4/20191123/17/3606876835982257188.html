        <b>Celtic moved three points clear at the top of the Scottish Premiership on Saturday as James Forrest scored twice in a comprehensive 4-0 home win over Livingston.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Odsonne Edouard put the Hoops ahead in the 19th minute with his 10th league goal of the season before Scott Brown added a second after 57 minutes.</p>
      <p>Forrest's second-half double added gloss to the scoreline and ensured Celtic made it eight consecutive wins in all competitions since they lost to Livie last month.</p>
      <p>Second-placed Rangers head to Hamilton on Sunday looking to close the gap on their Glasgow rivals.</p>
      <p>Jack Ross' first game in charge of Hibernian ended in a 3-1 victory over Motherwell at Easter Road.</p>
      <p>Liam Polworth had put the visitors in front before a quickfire double from Christian Doidge and Florian Kamberi turned the game on its head inside the opening 25 minutes.</p>
      <p>Substitute Daryl Horgan made sure of the three points with four minutes remaining as Motherwell missed the chance to go third.</p>
      <p>Caretaker boss Austin MacPhee's chances of landing the Hearts job on a permanent basis suffered a bodyblow as the Jambos conceded three times in the opening 16 minutes to lose 3-0 at Kilmarnock.</p>
      <p>Chris Burke scored twice either side of an Eamonn Brophy goal to hand Killie their first league win in four games.</p>
      <p>St Mirren moved off the bottom of the table as Sam Foley's first goal for the club secured a 2-1 win over Ross County.</p>
