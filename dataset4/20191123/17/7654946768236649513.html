      <h1>LIRR tracks were inspected hours before Queens derailment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:32:17+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:32</time> by <a rel="author">Jacob Henry and Ruth Weissmann</a></address>
      <p>The tracks where a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/23/600-lirr-passengers-stranded-after-derailment-in-queens/">packed Long Island Rail Road train derailed in Queens</a> — leaving 600 passengers stranded — had been inspected just hours before the transit snafu, MTA officials said Saturday.</p>
      <p>Two rear cars of the Jamaica Station-bound train jumped off the track at about 9:30 p.m. Friday night, forcing the railroad to dispatch a rescue train to evacuate the hundreds of trapped passengers, authorities said.</p>
      <p>It was not clear what had caused the derailment, which occurred just after the Babylon line tracks were inspected Friday afternoon, LIRR senior Vice President of Operations Rod Brooks told reporters.</p>
      <p>“We will go through an exhaustive evaluation and investigation process,” Brooks said. “We do know that there is a rail that was broken. We don’t know whether that was a cause or an effect.”</p>
      <p>The tracks are inspected for safety every week, he added.</p>
      <p>The ill-fated train had left Penn Station at 8:55 p.m. that night and was traveling at about 13 miles per hour when it jumped the track, the MTA said.</p>
      <p>Fuming riders were left waiting over an hour before an evacuation train arrived at about 11:15 p.m.</p>

      <p>“We have been trapped on this derailed train for well over an hour now. I’m going to need a refund for my ticket…” <a href="https://twitter.com/stephanietatton/status/1198089587433836554">tweeted passenger Stephanie Tatton</a>.</p>
      <p>No injuries were reported in the mishap, officials said.</p>
      <p>The derailment sparked cancellations and delays on the Babylon track, though officials said scheduled service had resumed Saturday and would have no impact on Monday morning’s commute.</p>
      <p>“We’ve worked through the night and around the clock,” Brooks said. “There’s no indication of any human error.”</p>
