      <p>Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Saturday that “anything can happen in cricket and politics”, and expressed the confidence that the new BJP-led government in Maharashtra would pass the floor test.</p>
      <p>The BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday returned as Maharashtra Chief Minister for a second term, propped up by NCP leader Ajit Pawar, who took oath as Deputy Chief Minister.</p>
      <p>Asked for his reaction to the dramatic developments, Mr. Gadkari told the media: “As I had commented earlier, anything can happen in cricket and politics. Now you would have understood the importance of my statement. I congratulate Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar. They will prove the majority in the House in the period given by the Governor.”</p>
      <p>Maharashtra would get a stable government under the leadership of Mr. Fadnavis and Mr. Ajit Pawar and witness further development, he added.</p>
