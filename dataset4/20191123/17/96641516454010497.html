      <h1>Apple renews Shyamalan's 'Servant' before it premieres</h1>
      <h2>It clearly has confidence in the Apple TV+ thriller.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:48:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>Add another Apple TV+ show to the list of those already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-08-the-morning-show-apple-tv-plus-renewals.html">slated to get second seasons</a>. M. Night Shyamalan and the <i>Tonight Show</i>'s Jimmy Fallon have <a href="https://youtu.be/Y_bySp0d_fI?t=314">confirmed</a> that Apple has renewed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-tv-plus-m-night-shyamalan-servant-trailer.html"><i>Servant</i></a> for a second season ahead of its November 28th premiere. That isn't completely surprising when the slow-burn story practically needs the extra room, but it's nonetheless a vote of confidence in the psychological thriller.</p>
      <p><i>Dickinson</i>, <i>For All Mankind</i> and <i>See</i> also got early renewals. Apple ordered two seasons of <i>The Morning Show</i> right from the start, so its future won't be up in the air for a while yet.</p>
      <p>To some extent, Apple needs these early renewals. Although there are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-15-apple-tv-snags-gary-oldman-for-spy-drama-slow-horses.html">numerous</a> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-08-apple-severance-ben-stiller.html">new shows</a> in the pipeline, Apple TV+ won't have a large selection for a while. The continuation of <i>Servant</i> and other early shows will ensure that you have more to watch (and of course, keep that subscription going) even if you exhaust the next wave of shows.</p>
