      <h1>James Franklin Getting Criticized For Early Decision vs. Ohio State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:35:46+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this afternoon, Ohio State and Penn State took the field for a game between College Football Playoff contenders.</p>
      <p>On its first possession of the game, Penn State moved the ball well for the first few plays of the game. The Nittany Lions climbed over mid-field and even reached the 42-yard line.</p>
      <p>However, they failed to find a first down on the Ohio State side of the field. Head coach James Franklin then made the decision to play field position and punt the ball.</p>
      <p>Let’s just say fans weren’t happy with the idea of punting the ball when the Nittany Lions were a nearly 20-point underdog.</p>
      <p>Here’s just some of the reaction.</p>

      <p>Penn State pulled off a relatively successful punt, downing the ball at the Ohio State 9-yard line.</p>
      <p>However, the Buckeyes flexed their muscle, scoring a touchdown on a 13-play, 91-yard drive to take a 7-0 lead.</p>
      <p>On Penn State’s very next possession, the Nittany Lions failed to find any success, going three-and-out.</p>
