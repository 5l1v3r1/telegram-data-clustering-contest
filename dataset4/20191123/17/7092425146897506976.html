        <b>Tesla boss Elon Musk has seen his net worth plummet one day after the botched launch of his latest electric vehicle.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shares in the firm dropped after the embarrassing unveiling of the electric pickup truck.</p>
      <p>The supposedly unbreakable window glass on the vehicle shattered twice during a demonstration.</p>
      <p>The failed stunt came after Mr Musk had talked at length about the strength of the glass on the futuristic, stainless steel-skinned Cybertruck.</p>
      <p>The vehicle was unveiled amid lasers and flames to build up its grand entrance.</p>
      <p>Mr Musk said: "You want a truck that's really tough, not fake tough.</p>
      <p>"You want a truck you can take a sledgehammer to, a truck that won't scratch, doesn't dent."</p>

      <p>He then asked a Tesla designer to hit the door with a sledgehammer, with no resulting damage.</p>
      <p>However, when they threw a metal ball at the driver's side window it smashed.</p>
      <p>A visibly shocked Mr Musk exclaimed: "Oh my f****** God."</p>
      <p>Attempting to save face, he said: "Maybe that was a little too hard."</p>
      <p>When the stunt was repeated, the passenger window also cracked.</p>
      <p>Mr Musk said: "At least it didn't go through, that's a plus side. We'll fix in in post."</p>
      <p>The gaffe became the main talking point of the show's launch while the radical design of the vehicle has also been the subject of jokes.</p>
      <p>Deutsche Bank said some "important unanswered questions" surround the vehicle, including whether the design was "too polarising".</p>
      <p>As a direct result of the failure, Tesla stocks fell by more than 6%, translating to a $768 million hit to Mr Musk's net worth (to $23.6 billion) according to <i>Forbes</i>.</p>
      <p>A year ago Mr Musk's behaviour resulted in a 6% hit to Tesla stock when he smoked marijuana on a live web show.</p>
      <p>The Cybertruck has been getting hammered online following the launch fiasco.</p>
