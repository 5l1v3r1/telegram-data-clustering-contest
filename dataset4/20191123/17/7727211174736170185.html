      <h1>Liverpool fans respond as Richard Keys fumes over Crystal Palace VAR decision</h1>
      <h2>VAR has dominated the headlines this season for Liverpool as they sit top of the Premier League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:19:50+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/paul-clarke/" target="_blank">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool received some more help from VAR in the first half of their clash at Crystal Palace and it has led to reaction aplenty.</p>
      <p>James Tomkins looked to have put his side in front after finding the net with a header from the back post following a corner for the hosts.</p>
      <p>Palace in many ways deserved the lead for a strong first-half display but their moment of excitement was short-lived as the decision went upstairs to VAR.</p>
      <p>It was adjudged that Jordan Ayew had pushed <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/dejan-lovren">Dejan Lovren</a> and subsequently the goal was chalked off, much to the frustration of the home fans.</p>
      <p>Not only that, pundits aplenty have been getting in on the act and giving their verdict, with <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> also getting the rub of the green from a VAR perspective in their 3-1 win over Man City earlier this month.</p>
      <p>beIN Sports presenter and former Sky Sports anchor Richard Keys gave his thoughts on the decision on Twitter immediately in the aftermath and he didn't hold back.</p>
      <p>"Terrible VR decision at Palace. Terrible," he tweeted.</p>
      <p>This then led to a mass reaction from Liverpool fans to the aforementioned tweet as they chose to use the moment to counter Keys' claim on the incident which occurred whilst the game was level at 0-0.</p>
      <p>Here is the best reaction from <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> fans below.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Arsenal legend Paul Merson was also in the same camp as Keys on the decision and here is what he had to say on Sky Sports whilst commentating on the game for Soccer Saturday.</p>
      <p>"I don't know what they are looking at. Someone has gone over so they may be looking at a foul. There is a shove but I don't know.</p>
      <p>"I'd still give it. He has disallowed it and that's ridiculous. He is nowhere near the ball. Shall we give Liverpool the league now?"</p>
