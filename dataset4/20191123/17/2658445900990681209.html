      <p>A number of people are believed to have died on both sides in a confrontation between suspected herdsmen who attacked a community in Adamawa State and some members of the community who resisted the attackers.</p>
      <p>Residents of the affected village, Shuwa-Kala’a, in Hong Local Government Area, who spoke on the incident, could not ascertain casualty figure by the time of filing this report Saturday evening, but they said people must have died among the attackers and among those who rose in challenge.</p>
      <p>One of the local sources, Sani Ahmed, said the attackers began by robbing a particular resident, and then going about their bigger mission afterwards.</p>
      <p>“This morning the herdsmen attacked and robbed a man who went to the farm to bring home his harvest. He returned and had barely informed the community of what happened to him when we saw them coming from all areas,” Sani said.</p>
      <p>He added, “Our local vigilante guys quickly mobilized and put up resistance and were able to repel them. Yes, there are casualties on both sides, but I cannot ascertain whether there were fatalities.”</p>
