      <h1>College GameDay Airs Incredible Feature On Former Oregon WR Keanon Lowe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:23:52+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>‘Hero’ is a word often thrown around when it comes to sports. Most of the time, the word describes a player who had an incredible performance or valiant effort. Former Oregon WR Keanon Lowe is known as a hero, but it’s not for anything he did on the field.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s <i>College GameDay</i> aired an incredible feature on the former Duck on Saturday morning. Lowe, now working as a high school football coach and campus security guard in Portland, chose to work with youth to make an impact. But what he did back in May was so much more than he ever would’ve expected.</p>
      <p>On May 17, Lowe was called to check on a student – a routine responsibility of his job. Just moments after entering the classroom, a potential school shooter carrying a shotgun entered the hallway. Lowe’s next step came out of instinct and compassion. Instead of tackling the gunman, he simply wrestled the gun away and embraced the young man in a hug.</p>
      <p>Check out College GameDay’s feature on Lowe in the video below.</p>

      <p>Lowe has made a bigger impact than he ever thought possible – saving many lives in the process. He’s also helped the Parkrose high school football team rise from the dust and become a competitive program.</p>
      <p>Lowe is the perfect representation of a hero.</p>
