      <h3>Makwa Sahgaiehcan First Nation leaders say the community needs “immediate relief” after declaring a state of emergency in the wake of several suicides and suicide attempts in recent weeks.</h3>
      <p>Chief Ronald Mitsuing on Thursday declared a state of emergency and a state of crisis for the community of around 1,000 people, located three hours northwest of Saskatoon. In the declaration, Mitsuing wrote that band members, professionals and people with ties to the community are in despair following the deaths and attempts.</p>
      <p>“The community and our frontline workers are looking for immediate relief; and we are calling on our local, provincial and federal governments for support,” he wrote.</p>

      <p>Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN) second vice-chief David Pratt, who shared the declaration on Twitter, called for a regional suicide prevention strategy.</p>
      <p>Band manager Barry Chalifoux said Friday that he spoke with the new minister of Indigenous Services Canada, Marc Miller. According to Chalifoux, Miller offered condolences to the community and to families, but made no promises and no offers of resources for the community.</p>
      <p>Chalifoux said he expected to speak with members of Miller’s department again on Friday.</p>
      <p>He said there have been three suicides this month, including a 10-year-old and 14-year-old. The 10-year-old, who died Thursday, is the youngest person to commit suicide in the community.</p>
      <p>Last week, a young father committed suicide, Chalifoux said. There have also been multiple instances recently of people, including children, attempting suicide.</p>
      <p>In a news release issued Thursday, Chalifoux said Makwa Sahgaiehcan has the highest rate of suicide among nine First Nations that belong to Meadow Lake Tribal Council.</p>
      <p>The deaths are strongly affecting the community’s mental health workers, including its registered psychologist, whom Chalifoux wrote is overwhelmed and feels unable to proceed without additional help. The community’s second registered therapist is closely related to the 10-year-old, according to Chalifoux, and the health director has also had a loss in the family.</p>
      <p>“They’re tired and they’re hurting as well. We’ve been dealing with this for far too long,” Chalifoux said in an interview.</p>
      <p>“The support workers need support as well, and that’s what we’re trying to get.”</p>
      <p>The MLTC and FSIN have offered help, and the community is waiting for those supports to arrive, he said.</p>

      <p>Chalifoux was in place as <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/another-indigenous-girl-commits-suicide-on-northern-saskatchewan-reserve">a grief counsellor at a school in the community in 2016 after a 13-year-old girl</a> committed suicide.</p>
      <p>Looking back, he feels help from other levels of government didn’t arrive in the form he thought they would, he said. Support in the form of services were short-term, and the community was promised additional funding, but received the same principle dollars other communities received, he added.</p>
      <p>At that point, a state of emergency hadn’t been declared.</p>
      <p>In a prepared statement, Indigenous Services Canada spokeswoman Martine Stevens said the department is working with Makwa Sahgaiehcan’s leadership, MLTC, FSIN, the Saskatchewan Health Authority and Saskatchewan Ministry of Health. She said the MLTC mental wellness team has been sent to the community and the tribal council’s three therapists, elder and youth supports are also available. Stevens said two additional councillors from the tribal council’s education department will also be sent to Makwa Sahgaiehcan.</p>
      <p>On Friday evening, the department provided a statement from Miller, who expressed his condolences to the families and to the community.</p>
      <p>“Any loss of life from suicide is a tragedy beyond measure,” he said in the statement.</p>
      <p>Miller said he spoke to Mitsuing and Makwa Sahgaiehcan First Nation’s leadership Friday afternoon to express his condolences and to ensure necessary supports and resources are in place.</p>
      <p>The province, in a statement released Friday afternoon, offered condolences to the families and community. The province said that Minister of Rural and Remote Health Warren Kaeding has been in contact with Mitsuing, Chalifoux and the senior director of health and social development for tribal council, Flora Fiddler, about making supports available.</p>
      <p>The province said the SHA is prepared to make available mental health and addictions staff trained in suicide risk assessment, particularly to assess other children in the community, in order to insure they have the supports they need. The Ministry of Social Services has also offered to send resources out of its community-based organizations in the area.</p>
      <p>As well, the province said the Ministry of Education has reached out to school divisions to identify staff that could be “redeployed” if needed, saying the neighbouring school division has already met with the community’s school about help it could offer.</p>
      <p>In a statement, FSIN Chief Bobby Cameron called on all levels of government to ensure the FSIN Suicide Prevention Strategy is implemented immediately. The strategy, released in 2018, calls for both the province and federal governments to provide interventions on a both a short-term and a long-term basis until the rate of death by suicide of Indigenous people in Saskatchewan is lowered to the rate of that of non-Indigenous people.</p>
