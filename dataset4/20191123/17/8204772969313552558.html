        <b>Lyon 6 Leinster 13</b>
      </p>
      <p>Leinster were relieved to leave Lyon with their winning record intact in the European Champions Cup after a nervous end to their win at the Stade Matmut de Gerland.</p>
      <p>Just one try from number eight <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Max+Deegan">Max Deegan</a> coloured a match in which the Leinster defence, more than go-forward back play, won the game against a hard-running home side that was just short on finishing power.</p>
      <p>The boot of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Johnny+Sexton">Johnny Sexton</a> gave Leinster an early lead after withstanding the first flush of Lyon intensity in the opening minutes. Another penalty a few minutes later he was invited again but his penalty hit the post.</p>
      <p>Lyon spent much of the opening quarter in the Leinster half but precious little got past the defence to threaten the line, the most promising Leinster move coming from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Robbie+Henshaw">Robbie Henshaw</a> on 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>It was both good and bad from Henshaw who saw space and made the break. But with <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=James+Lowe">James Lowe</a> on his outside shoulder the Leinster centre stepped into contact and the moment was lost.</p>
      <p>While Lyon dominated territory and possession Leinster remained patient. Their first chance arrived when Josh van der Flier blocked down outhalf <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Jonathan+Wisniewski">Jonathan Wisniewski</a> to feed <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=James+Ryan">James Ryan</a> for a gallop up the park.</p>
      <p>Van der Flier was up fast cleaning out inside the Lyon 22 as Leinster picked and drove. Five phases later Max Deegan, with considerable help from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Rhys+Ruddock">Rhys Ruddock</a>, ran through hooker <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mickael+Ivaldi">Mickael Ivaldi</a> for a try against play with Sexton converting for 0-10.</p>
      <p>It all seemed to come too easily for the former champions and even when <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Jordan+Larmour">Jordan Larmour</a> was binned for diving in from an offside position, cynically according to English referee <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Luke+Pearce">Luke Pearce</a>, Lyon could not get on the scoreboard.</p>
      <p>Lyon number eight <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Carl+Fearns">Carl Fearns</a> was causing problems and scrumhalf <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Baptiste+Couilloud">Baptiste Couilloud</a> was endlessly sniping forward, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Rob+Kearney">Rob Kearney</a> covering wonderfully to put the Lyon captain into touch from an attacking kick and chase on 32 minutes.</p>
      <p>After almost five minutes of frantic tackling inside their 22 in the closing minutes of the first half, Leinster went into the break rightly proud of a defensive masterclass, with the home side having nothing to show for all their territory and possession.</p>
      <p>Leinster also knew that both the lineout, where two were lost, and the scrum were coming under some pressure from an unrelentingly up-tempo home side.</p>
      <p>Leinster could have extended their lead on 53 minutes when Ryan went soloing up the park. With three Leinster backs outside him, it was fullback <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Toby+Arnold">Toby Arnold</a> chasing back who got a hand to Ryan’s arm as he made the delivery.</p>
      <p>A referral a few minutes later for a hit off the ball on Sexton by Fearns drew a chorus of booing, but neither side could gain the upper hand in a match that was becoming an arm wrestle of kicking and set pieces with little free-flowing rugby.</p>
      <p>Just past the hour a huge turnover from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Andrew+Porter">Andrew Porter</a> on Fearns as Lyon tried to maul their lineout drew enthusiastic back-slapping from Leinster, who were coming under pressure.</p>
      <p>A penalty from captain Wisniewski on 67 minutes to close the gap to 3-10 laced the final 10 minutes with nervous Leinster energy. Sexton believed he had silenced the crowd on 75 minutes when he went under the posts, only for a referral to show <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Garry+Ringrose">Garry Ringrose</a> had obstructed a potential tackler.</p>
      <p>But an exchange of penalties in the closing minutes left Leinster 13-6 in front, the ball pinged far into the crowd as full-time closed the match. Lyon left frustrated, Leinster bouyant, knowing hard wins like this will shape their European campaign for the good.</p>
