      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a> has responded after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> fans chanted for his sacking during the disappointing draw with Southampton.</p>
      <p>The Gunners were held to a 2-2 draw by relegation-battlers Southampton on Saturday and a number of fans voiced their frustration at under-fire boss Emery.</p>
      <p>Chants of ‘We want Emery out’ and ‘Sacked in the morning’ were heard at the Emirates after a draw which sees the north Londoners slip to ninth in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a>.</p>

      <p>Arsenal are now nine points worse off than they were at the corresponding stage last term and the pressure is only increasing on former PSG and Sevilla boss Emery.</p>
      <p>Asked about the atmosphere at the Emirates, Emery said: ‘I understand the supporters are angry and frustrated.</p>
      <p>‘The players are feeling the same and my job is to find out how to improve and the key is to be with the supporters. Our target was to win but also to play well and we didn’t do that.’</p>

      <p>He told BT Sport: ‘The boos are deserved. It was a terrible, terrible performance.</p>
      <p>‘Emery is not doing himself any favours. I don’t watch any coach to lose their job but the club is not progressing. They are so disjointed.’</p>
