      <p>Tottenham’s poor start to the season was a focus of the first team meeting, with Mourinho pulling up the Premier League table during his speech.</p>
      <p>In a bid to motivate his new players Mourinho stressed that the current crop of Spurs players were much better than their position on the table suggested.</p>
      <p>He reportedly pulled some of Spurs’ star players aside to talk to them individually.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is said to have talked to Harry Kane, Hugo Lloris, Toby Alderweireld, Harry Winks, Eric Dier, Dele Alli, as well as Christian Eriksen who is in his final year of his contract.</p>
      <p>Jose was also reminded by his new players of his 2015 vow to never manage the Coys due to his love for Chelsea, to which Mourinho guaranteed times had changed.</p>
      <p>He ensured that his former work at Chelsea wouldn’t impact his role at Spurs and that he would be looked at as a Tottenham brand man even suggesting he would wear Spurs pyjamas to bed.</p>

      <p>During his first press conference as Tottenham manager Mourinho was questioned about his previous tenures in English football and whether this would impact his role at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>“I think they have to see me as Mr Inter, Mr Real Madrid, Mr Porto,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I think they have to see me as Mr Club. Everywhere I go, as I used to say in a funny way, I arrive, wear the pyjamas for the club.</p>
      <p>“I even sleep with the pyjamas. I even wear the tracksuit, you confuse the tracksuit with the pyjamas.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho will hope his attempt at instilling a family attitude at Spurs will quickly turn things around, with the club set to take on West Ham before travelling to Greece to face Olympiacos in the Champions League.</p>
