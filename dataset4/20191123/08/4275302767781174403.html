      <h2>Kirriemuir rock god Bon Scott is to be honoured with a real Highway to Hell on the other side of the world.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:45:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/graemestrachan/" target="_blank">Graeme Strachan</a></address>
      <p>The star and his family grew up in Kirriemuir where father Charles Scott worked in the family bakery on Bank Street.</p>
      <p>In 1952, when Scott was six, the family emigrated to Australia.</p>
      <p>There he became part of one of music’s biggest successes after joining Glasgow-born brothers Angus and Malcolm Young in their band AC/DC.</p>
      <p>Infamous as a hard-living, headline-grabbing star of stage and studio, Scott commanded the adoration and attention of millions.</p>

      <p>Western Australia’s Canning Highway, immortalised in AC/DC’s song ‘Highway To Hell’, will become the site of a tribute to the late singer to mark the 40th anniversary of his death.</p>
      <p>It will be shut for 10 hours on March 1 to be transformed into a real Highway To Hell.</p>
      <p>Scott lived in Fremantle after leaving Kirriemuir.</p>
      <p>The singer’s ashes were laid to rest by his family at Fremantle Cemetery on March 1 1980.</p>
      <p>Organisers of the 2020 Perth Festival have taken inspiration from Scott’s connection to the area for the free event which is suitably titled Highway To Hell.</p>
      <p>The event will see a wide range of artists, from AC/DC tribute bands to the Perth Symphony Orchestra, play their versions of AC/DC classics from the backs of a convoy of flatbed trucks and trailers.</p>

      <p>Along the 10km stretch, fans and families are being encouraged to have picnics while enjoying the spectacle from the side of the road, or follow the procession as it makes its way from Applecross to Fremantle.</p>
      <p>A range of other events are planned in the lead up to, during and after the Highway To Hell event, including panel discussions, public art displays, a quiz night, patch sewing workshops, a vinyl fair and pop-up parties.</p>
      <p>Organisers said: “We’re reclaiming the iconic Canning Highway and turning it into the world’s longest stage for a day.</p>
      <p>“Taking inspiration from the AC/DC song of the same name and Bon Scott’s connection to the area we’re paying homage to Highway To Hell.”</p>
      <p>AC/DC fans from all over the world will then flock to Kirriemuir in May for three days of rock and roll at Bonfest.</p>
      <p>The annual event has been organised by community group DD8 Music since 2006.</p>
      <p>Scott died after a night out in London in 1980 and the official cause was listed on the death certificate as “acute alcohol poisoning” and classified as “death by misadventure”.</p>
