      <p>A man in his 50s has been arrested on suspicion of murder following the death of a prisoner at <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Cloverhill">Cloverhill</a> Prison in Dublin this weekend.</p>
      <p>The man was arrested at Cloverhill Prison on Sunday morning and is being detained for questioning at Clondalkin Garda Station under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.</p>
      <p>“This morning, Sunday 24th November 2019, a male in his 50s was arrested at Cloverhill Prison on suspicion of murder,” gardaí said in a statement.</p>
      <p>It added that a postmortem was completed on the body of the dead man on Saturday by State pathologist Dr Margaret Bolster but the results will not be released for operational reasons.</p>
      <p>It is understood the man died after being attacked by his cell mate in the prison.</p>
      <p>Gardaí believe the deceased was strangled after being attacked just before midnight on Friday on the B wing of the west Dublin jail.</p>
      <p>The Irish Times understands a prisoner in the cell next to the one where the fatal attack unfolded heard a disturbance and called for staff.</p>
      <p>While prison officers rushed to the scene and opened the cell, the victim had already been fatally injured.</p>
      <p>Staff tried to resuscitate the man but efforts to save his life were not successful and he was later pronounced dead in the cell.</p>
      <p>The attack occurred about four hours after prisoners had been locked into their cells for the night.</p>
      <h3>Very rare</h3>
      <p>Homicides in Irish prisons are very rare and Friday night’s attack is under investigation by the Garda, Inspector of Prisons and the Irish Prison Service.</p>
      <p>After efforts to resuscitate the victim were not successful gardaí were called and immediately sealed off the cell as a crime scene.</p>
      <p>Informed sources said it appeared the dead man was strangled. The dead man’s cell mate is the only suspect.</p>
      <p>Garda Headquarters issued a statement on Saturday saying: “Shortly after midnight gardaí and emergency services were called by prison authorities following an incident involving two male prisoners in custody at the prison.</p>
      <p>“A man in his late 30s was treated by emergency services but was pronounced dead at the scene a short time later.</p>
      <p>“The coroner has been notified and the services of the State Pathologist and Garda Technical Bureau have been requested.</p>
      <p>“Gardaí are following a definite line of enquiry and the investigation is ongoing.”</p>
