      <p>Brian Rice says Hamilton need to start winning games again – starting with Rangers on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Rice knows it’s not going to be easy against Steven Gerrard’s side in the lunchtime show-down, but insists his side must treat it like any other game.</p>
      <p>It’s the start of a tough run of four games which also see Accies travel to Celtic Park – with a visit at Livingston in between – before entertaining St Mirren on December 7.</p>
      <p>Accies drew 2-2 at Kilmarnock a fortnight ago, despite being 2-0 up, drew with Ross County from a winning position and lost at St Johnstone, having taken the lead.</p>
      <p>Rice said: “It’s time for us to start winning games.</p>
      <p>“It’s OK drawing, away from home, but we need to try and turn a few of the draws into wins to give ourselves a wee bit of breathing space. Against Ross County we could have got three points, and we would have deserved them, in my opinion, and at Kilmarnock we were 2-0 up and ended up with another draw.</p>
      <p>“It’s good not to lose, but we need to start turning some of these draws into wins.</p>
      <p>“It’s Rangers on Sunday but we have to treat it like any other game; it’s three points at stake.</p>

      <p>“We know how difficult it’s going to be, we’re under no illusions about that, with the season Rangers are having.</p>
      <p>“It’s going to be very difficult but we need to come up with a game-plan that gives us a chance of taking something from the match.</p>
      <p>“It is a tough run, but we take it as it comes. Rangers, Livingston, Celtic, is very difficult, but we have to try and take something from the games.”</p>
      <p>Rice added: “Celtic and Rangers aren’t really our fight. Obviously we will try as much as we can to take something out of these matches, and I’m a great believer that if you set up properly and do things correctly, then you have a chance of getting something.</p>
      <p>“We’ve seen how good they are with the goals they’ve scored and their results at home and in Europe, our fight is against the nine other teams.”</p>
      <p>Hamilton go into the clash with Rangers minus suspended duo Sam Stubbs and Scott Martin, while there are injury problems, including defender Ciaran McKenna undergoing a ‘tidy-up’ operation on a cartilage problem.</p>
      <p>Rice said: “We’re down to the bare bones but there are no excuses. We’re a squad for a reason. If you’re part of the squad you should be ready to play, so we just need to get on with it.”</p>
      <p>The game kicks-off at 12.15pm on Sunday and is live on Sky Sports.</p>
