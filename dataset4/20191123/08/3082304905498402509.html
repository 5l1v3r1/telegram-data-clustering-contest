        <b>Arsenal manager Unai Emery has insisted that Lucas Torreira has a “big future” at the Emirates, after holding talks with the midfielder earlier this week.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Previously, it was reported that Torreira has been targeted by a few clubs in Spain and Italy, and during the recently-concluded international break, the Uruguay star himself spoke about his future.</p>
      <p>“Arsenal needs me to be focused,” he said. “I can’t start talking about another team.”</p>
      <p>“I need to be focused and when the transfer window arrives we will see what will happen.”</p>
      <p>And on Friday, Emery revealed he held talks with Torreira about his situation, when he returned from international duty.</p>
      <p>“I spoke with him on Wednesday and Thursday,” the ex-Paris Saint Germain (PSG) boss said, before adding:</p>
      <p>“He is young, his process here is starting. He started playing in the Premier League last year and he progressed, but this year again he needs to progress.”</p>
      <p>“He is a very good player, important for us, and his focus needs to be with us 100 per cent. His response to me was positive.”</p>
      <p>“Lucas has a very big commitment and very good behaviour,” he added further, before concluding:</p>
      <p>“He has a very big future here but he needs to improve. He has to learn in some situations, individually to help us, to do better.”</p>
