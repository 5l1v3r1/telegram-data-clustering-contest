      <h1>Why this local expedition medic has opened two travel clinics in Devon</h1>
      <h2>The Exeter and Barnstaple clinics provide travel vaccines, antimalarials and travel health advice</h2>

      <p>Over a decade ago, one Devon man, who has brushed shoulders and worked with some of Britain's most-loved TV personalities, took the plunge, leaving his Emergency Department nurse post and setting up a travel clinic specialising in preparing people for travel.</p>
      <p>Whilst most people normally pop to see their GP for jabs before flying into the sunset, James Moore recognised the need for those requiring expert or timely advice.</p>
      <p>The Exeter Travel Clinic rapidly became a local business success story, recognised across the south west as the place to go to for specialist travel health advice, supporting local GP services in providing both travel and non- travel vaccines.</p>
      <p>Ten years later, James has decided to bring a slice of this expertise back to his north Devon roots, opening a clinic branch in Boutport St, Barnstaple.</p>

      <p>With diplomas in tropical nursing, travel medicine and an MSc in Global Health, James ensures the travel service is founded on the best and most up-to-date information, and is passionate about staff development.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the new venture, James said, "First and foremost, the level of our knowledge and experience is second to none.</p>
      <p>"Expert knowledge is a key component in service delivery and, as well as being experienced Practice Nurses, our team has studied at the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons in Glasgow, and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.</p>
      <p>“Secondly, experience is incredibly important, and our staff have ticked off quite a few countries between them.</p>
      <p>"Knowing what it is like to travel with a family, or the worries and concerns people have when they step off the plane into the heat, hustle and bustle of a foreign country really makes a difference when giving advice. This ensures you get the jabs you need, not just what someone looks up on the internet."</p>

      <p>Having worked as a medic on a number of high-profile expeditions, you can see James’ passion for travel and medicine shine through.</p>
      <p>From the deserts of Sudan with Joanna Lumley, through to Papua New Guinea jungles with Ben Fogle, and on to Antarctic islands with the BBC Planet Earth 2 team, James and the team have travel experience well and truly covered.</p>
      <p>James added, "I am really excited about our Barnstaple branch. Our travel clinic in Barnstaple will continue the great service provided in Exeter, whilst supporting local north Devon GP practices."</p>
