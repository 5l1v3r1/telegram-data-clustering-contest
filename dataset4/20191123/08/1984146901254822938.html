      <p>Phil Parkinson has laid down the gauntlet to Sunderland's forwards ahead the impending returns of Charlie Wyke and Lynden Gooch, and also the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Neither <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/charlie-wyke">Wyke</a> nor Gooch will make Saturday's clash with Coventry City as they continue their rehabilitation from injuries - but both are closing in on returns, with Sunderland struggling for forward options in their absence.</p>
      <p>And after a positive start under <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phil-parkinson">Phil Parkinson,</a> with plenty of early attacking intent, confidence has slowly seeped out of the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> forwards, with just four goals scored in the last seven games, since that impressive 5-0 home thrashing of Tranmere Rovers.</p>
      <p>Will Grigg continues to struggle in front of goal, while star men such as Chris Maguire and Aiden McGeady are yet to truly get started, despite having five goals apiece so far this term.</p>
      <p>And ahead of players returning from injury, and more important still, a January transfer window that the Sunderland boss describes having a 'clear picture' of what he needs, Parkinson's message to his out-of-form forwards is a clear one.</p>
      <p>"Without doubt [the other forwards should have laid down a claim in other's absence]. The opportunity is there for someone to grab hold of a shirt and say, 'Look, I'm the man, people have got to now push me out the team,' and that's the kind of mentality we need.</p>
      <p>"Players get injured in football clubs all the time. Other place players step up to the plate and take the opportunity and that's what we need.</p>
      <p>"There's no there's no kind of magic wand where I can wave it. The squad is where it is. I think in any club when you when you take a couple of strikers out of the equation, even Premiership level, you're going to be depleted because you only have so many players in any one squad."</p>
      <p>It's not the greatest indictment of Sunderland's strikers this season that it's actually two wingers who are joint-top scorers so far. Marc McNulty is only one behind McGeady and Maguire, but will miss Saturday's game with a hamstring injury that has plagued his season. He's not really been fancied by Parkinson so far either.</p>
      <p>But as well as issuing the challenge to his forwards, Parkinson is keen to stress that they shouldn't just be judged on the goals they score.</p>
      <p>"I think with forwards it's about the more you concern yourself with the goals, the other side of your game falls away," he said.</p>
      <p>"I've been talking about making sure that your contribution to the structure of the team is good, and it helps the team win games of football. If a goal comes great.</p>
      <p>"And I've seen it in strikers before where they become so focused on getting a goal that they don't contribute enough to the team. Of course we're working on the finishing aspect of it, but more importantly as well, it's making sure they're contributing to the all-round play of the side."</p>

      <p>Grigg continues to struggle at Sunderland, but it's not just his strikers the Sunderland manager is disappointed with. Sunderland have lacked creativity recently - particularly in the four recent cup matches. The defeat at Gillingham in the FA Cup on Tuesday was a new low, however, with the Black Cats failing to offer a single shot on target in 120 minutes of action.</p>
      <p>And Parkinson knows that must improve.</p>
      <p>He said: "I think we lack options to freshen it up from the bench, with players injured, which is important in any game.</p>
      <p>"I think the supply line just the other night wasn't the way it should be. It wasn't good enough.</p>
      <p>"In other games we've had lots of chances. Even the Oxford game, we had enough chances. But probably the other night was the first time really where we didn't create enough chances.</p>
      <p>"I want the team to supply the chances to our strikers. All I've said since I've come in is when we're get in wide areas, if you've got players like Griggy, Charlie Wyke in the team, they score from crosses. You've just got to look at Charlie where his goals have come from, and Griggy in the past in his career.</p>
      <p>"Obviously to lose him [Wyke] the first game is a blow, I can't hide away from that, but he will come back stronger than ever and we look forward to working with him."</p>
      <p>While Parkinson remains the optimist, it's fair to say such a mood is not widespread on Wearside. Supporters are growing increasingly frustrated.</p>
      <p>Parkinson understands, and appreciates the onus is on them to create excitement that leads to an atmosphere his players can thrive under.</p>
      <p>He said: "I can only talk about my first two league games because the Gillingham game was very different feeling with just the one stand open, and obviously the Leicester one too. My first two league games here has been 26-30,000 and the atmosphere was terrific. It was a great atmosphere, the supporters responded to the lads, the lads enjoy playing at home.</p>
      <p>"The last two games have not been a true stadium experience with the sparsity of the crowd. But the atmosphere in those two league games games lifted the players, and the supporters know what's at stake.</p>
      <p>"So to the players so the management, like I said, 31 games left and such a huge part of the season. And we've got it all to play for. </p>
      <p>"I think the atmosphere in the ground reflects what the fans see on the football pitch, and they will respond. If we make a few tackles, we run hard, we close down, we have attempts on goal, the whole place, everyone will be out of their seats getting behind the team. I'm absolutely sure of that."</p>
