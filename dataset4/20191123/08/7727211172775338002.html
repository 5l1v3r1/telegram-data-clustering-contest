      <h2>There's lots of bargains to be had just before Christmas</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/sophie-mccoid/" target="_blank">Sophie McCoid</a></address>
      <p>It might sound strange but you can actually buy stolen goods online - and it's completely legal.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/how-you-could-ill-gotten-12687429">perfectly legitimate way to buy goods</a> means you could pick up an absolute bargain just before Christmas.</p>
      <p>Police forces across the country sell goods they've seized from criminals, as well as items from lost property which have been held at a police station for too long - <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/money-saving/stolen-goods-you-can-buy-17264089">reports the Manchester Evening News.</a></p>
      <p>And you can also feel good about your purchase, because all the money made goes on to help victims of crime, and is <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/cash-raised-merseyside-criminals-go-9232586">reinvested in policing initiatives.</a></p>
      <p>A whole host of items <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/gucci-trainers-hot-pink-chanel-15745885">get put up for sale,</a> ranging from designer goods to bicycles and electrical devices.</p>
      <p>There are three main methods of selling the stolen goods.</p>
      <p>These include police force eBay accounts and Bumblebee Auctions - which is a dedicated eBay-style website marketing stolen goods held by forces across England and Wales.</p>
      <p>However, you usually have to collect items in person.</p>
      <p>Some forces also sell items through auction houses - where you can attend in person to see what's on offer.</p>
      <p>We had a look online and found some of the best items you can buy at the moment.</p>
