      <p>Michael Eavis has hinted that <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/taylor-swift?_ga=2.229407066.775729865.1574497119-786941686.1572361240">Taylor Swift</a> could be set to headline <a href="https://www.nme.com/festivals/glastonbury">Glastonbury 2020</a> in a new interview.</p>
      <p>The ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/taylor-swift-lover-review">Lover</a>‘ pop star is currently bookies’ second favourite to top Worthy Farm’s 50th anniversary line-up next summer, behind ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/kendrick-lamar-damn-review">DAMN</a>‘ rapper <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/kendrick-lamar">Kendrick Lamar</a>.</p>

      <p>Adding further weight to the growing speculation over Swift’s potential Glastonbury debut, festival boss Eavis has now confirmed that one of the two remaining headliners is a female artist.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p07t4snh"><i>BBC Somerset</i></a>, Eavis said: “I’ve got two of my favourite headliners… already booked […] I can’t tell you the second one […] you would love her to bits… everybody does […] but no names at the moment…”</p>
      <p>He went on to confirm that “all of the headliners” have now been booked for Glastonbury 2020. You can listen to the conversation at the 2:25:44 mark <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p07t4snh">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Swift, who’s <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/taylor-swift-announces-2020-uk-european-festival-tour-2548885">performing a run of European festival dates as part of her summer 2020 ‘Lover’ Tour</a>, is likely to take the Sunday (June 28) slot at Worthy Farm as she’s currently scheduled to play in Oslo on the Friday evening (June 26).</p>
      <p>This update comes after <a href="https://www.nme.com/festivals/glastonbury/paul-mccartney-confirms-glastonbury-slot-cryptic-twitter-post-2568890">Paul McCartney was announced as the first Glasto headliner</a> earlier this week. The <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/the-beatles">Beatles</a> icon will top the Pyramid Stage on Saturday, June 27.</p>
      <p>Announcing the news, co-organiser Emily Eavis wrote: “IT’S REAL!! So excited.. Having Paul McCartney coming back to headline the Pyramid next year is an absolute dream come true. There really was no one that we wanted more for the 50th anniversary.”</p>
