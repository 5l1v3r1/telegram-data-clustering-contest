      <h1>BBI Report: Moses Kuria's 10 Conditions for Supporting It</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:14:16+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:14</time> by <a rel="author">John Paul Simiyu</a></address>

        <b><a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46058-ahmednassir-goes-all-out-after-moses-kuria-makes-damning-revelations">Gatundu MP Moses Kuria</a> has issued conditions for supporting the BBI report which was scheduled to be released on Tuesday, November 26, 2019. </b>
      </p>
      <p>In a long post on his Facebook page on Saturday, November 23, Kuria stated that he and other concerned Kenyans would only support the report if it fulfilled the objectives he had in mind.</p>
      <p>"We will strongly support the BBI report if it assures us that the person who will wield the executive power will be directly elected by Kenyans and if it assures us of one man, one vote, one shilling," Kuria wrote.</p>

      <p>The vocal legislator who has <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46588-moses-kuria-digs-waiguru-after-sagana-meeting">been blowing hot and cold</a> on the BBI issue seems to have changed tune, following President Uhuru Kenyatta's announcement at Kibabii University's graduation ceremony on Friday, November 22, where he gave the way forward regarding the report.</p>
      <p>Kuria clarified that while he had no issue with any referendum recommendation in the report, he would only support it if the referendum was held alongside the General Election.</p>
      <p>"We will strongly support the BBI report if it provides that all contestants for elective seats shall sign an accord to accept election results unconditionally and only resort to judicial processes provided for in the constitution," he added.</p>
      <p>Moses Kuria also weighed on corruption scandals that have rocked the Jubilee regime, stating that he would only support the document if it would show intent on bringing to an end the graft scourge.</p>
      <p>"The BBI report should declare categorically and unequivocally that corruption has no start date nor expiry date and corruption is corruption whether it happens today or at the dawn of independence," he stated.</p>
      <p>Kuria also urged Uhuru and Raila to acknowledge that Kenyans were going through harsh economic times, adding that the BBI report needs to include measures that would save the country from further decline.</p>
      <p>"We shall strongly support the BBI report if it recognizes the fact that it is coming when we are hungry and angry. In this respect, the BBI shall ensure our traders' businesses are re-opened, the BBI shall restore the price of milk paid to farmers to Ksh 40, while equally ensuring fair reward for sweat by our coffee, tea, pyrethrum, maize, potatoes, fish and other crops. The BBI report shall put an end to all auctions and CRB listings," Kuria stated.</p>

        <b>Below are the rest of the conditions issues by the Gatundu South MP</b>
      </p>
      <p>"We will strongly support the BBI report if it defines inclusiveness as the general effort to bring peace, love, unity, cohesion and national values among all the people of the Kenyan nation and not as a cover to say that some persons must be in government for that government to be legitimate.</p>
      <p>"We shall strongly support the BBI report if it is not used as a political tool for 2022 or future elections, to extend term limits through the front or back door or to create conditions to stop emerging leaders from pursuing their legitimate political ambitions.</p>
      <p>"We shall strongly support the BBI report if it recognises peace as an inalienable gift from God Almighty and not a special bonus which is occasionally given to Kenyans by some few people when things go their way, or denied from Kenyans when things fail to go their way.</p>
      <p>"We shall strongly support the BBI report if it comes with a clear and straight forward definition for ethics, values and ethos and shall not define people as being corrupt only when they belong to certain political formations and persuasions only for them to be as white as cotton when they change to opposite formations or persuasions.</p>
      <p>"We will strongly support the BBI report if it reduces the burden of representation and the burden of big government."</p>
