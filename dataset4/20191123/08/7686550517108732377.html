      <h1>How Lotto lout Michael Carroll blew nearly £6m "on drugs and hookers, holidays and cars”</h1>
      <h2>He's now a skint coal man just three years after scooping £9.7m on the National Lottery</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Charlie Gall, Louie Smith, Amardeep Bassey</a></address>
      <p>Mickey Carroll says it was the best £1 that he ever spent.</p>
      <p>But the millions that it reaped left him broke, homeless and nearly dead.</p>
      <p>After scooping the £9.7m jackpot back in 2002, the brash then-19-year-old, earned the nickname 'King of the Chavs', boasting of spending his winnings on drugs, booze and hookers.</p>
      <p>By his own admission a cocaine habit saw him "sniff away" three houses - while the man also known as the Lotto Lout - confesses he'd swig half a bottle of vodka before getting out of bed.</p>
      <p>Carroll's depraved behaviour saw him appear in court more than 30 times, often arriving in flash cars and downing cans of beer, reports the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/lotto-lout-sniffed-away-3-20894644">Mirro</a>r.</p>
      <p>Within three years of his win, Mickey was left with just one million pounds in his bank account.</p>
      <p>In the end, Carroll's riches and brushes with the underworld put him firmly in the crosshairs of gangsters across the country and Mickey admits he would be dead by now if the money hadn't run out.</p>
      <p>But the former binman also gave £4m away to his family and his then-girlfriend and the mother of his child, Sandra Aitken.</p>
      <p>The remaining £5.7m he frittered away on maintaining an extravagant lifestyle, including wild holidays to the Costa del Sol with his pals.</p>
      <p>Now 35, he recalls: "We used to go to the local wh***house because the girls there were better looking.</p>
      <p>"We'd get our own drugs first and be high on cocaine by the time we rocked up at the brothels.</p>
      <p>"I drank vodka and fresh orange, any lager, cider or whiskey, as long as it was wet. I'd wake up in some strange places."</p>
      <p>Mickey's raucous behaviour wasn't just confined to his trips away.</p>
      <p>Alcohol and narcotics were a part of his every day life.</p>
      <p>"I'd wake up, do three lines of charlie and drink half a bottle of vodka before I got out of bed.</p>
      <p>"I was a full-blown alcoholic, doing two bottles of vodka a day."</p>
      <h3>Marriage ends</h3>
      <p>The drinking and the brothels put an end to his short marriage to Sandra, who was seven months pregnant with their daughter, when his lottery numbers came up.</p>
      <p>She walked out in disgust shortly after they wed in 2003, accusing him of cheating on her with other women and surrounding himself with hangers-on.</p>
      <p>Mickey, who boasts of bedding 4,000 women, does not dispute any of Sandra’s claims.</p>
      <p>He says: “I spent the rest of the money on drugs and hookers, holidays and cars.”</p>

      <p>His Norfolk mansion “The Grange” was used for wild parties, and the lawn became a track for demolition car derbies. As a result, the luxury property soon fell into disrepair.</p>
      <p>He says: “It lay derelict for about 10 years. My mate’s mum and dad lived in it until I kicked them out.</p>
      <p>“I had another two houses, but it’s all gone – I sniffed ’em away.”</p>
      <p>By 2005, his accountant warned he was down to his last million and as the money dwindled, the “friends’” and hangers-on began to drift away.</p>
      <h3>Dogs had throats cut</h3>
      <p>Enemies were also circling and one morning he found his six Rottweilers dead, their throats slit.</p>
      <p>Mickey, who was jailed for affray in 2006, says: “Gangsters sent me pictures of my family. They threatened to chop my daughter up, and my whole family.</p>

      <p>“They were dangerous guys, a Liverpool firm, so I paid them 130 grand.</p>
      <p>"They backed off for a while, then there was a bit of an altercation and the boys in London sorted it out for me.”</p>
      <p>By 2013, Mickey was broke, homeless and struggling to find work because of his reputation.</p>
      <p>He says: “I’d turn up at interviews and they’d say, ‘We just wanted to see whether it was you or not’.”</p>
      <h3>"It was dive"</h3>
      <p>He eventually followed Sandra to Scotland, moving to Moray, where he was so broke he lived in a squalid hotel for down-and-outs.</p>
      <p>He says: “It was a dive, but I had food and beer, all good.</p>
      <p>“That was 2013. I was homeless for three months. Easy come, easy go.”</p>
      <p>He worked at the Walkers biscuit factory in Aberlour before starting in a slaughterhouse.</p>

      <p>He says: “I stayed there for five years until it shut down. I do miss the slaughterhouse.</p>
      <p>"I loved it there. I’ve got my slaughterhouse licence. I’ll never lose that.”</p>
      <p>He later got his coal job and now works seven days a week.</p>
      <p>He says: “I’m a skint lottery winner. It’s got me quite a few women so I don’t mind. I’m living in a rented flat.</p>
      <p>“I’m happy. I don’t have to look over my shoulder any more, no one’s going to hit me over the back of the head and rob me.</p>
      <p>"I reckon I’m lucky to be alive. If I still had the money I’d probably be six feet under.”</p>
