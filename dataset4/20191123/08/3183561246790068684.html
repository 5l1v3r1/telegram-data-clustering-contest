      <h3>Joker 2</h3>
      <p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/todd-phillips-disputes-joker-sequel-rumors-no-contract-1202191289/">Indie Wire</a>, Todd Phillips revealed what he called “the real truth” behind <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/a-joker-sequel-is-happening-and-now-more-dc-origin-stories-may-be-on-the-way">recent rumours of a <i>Joker</i> sequel</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>Here’s the real truth about a sequel. While Joaquin and I have talked about it, and while touring the world with Warner Bros executives — going to Toronto, and Venice, and other places — of course, we’re sitting at dinner and they’re saying, ‘So, have you thought about…?’ But, talking about contracts, there’s not a contract for us to even write a sequel, we’ve never approached Joaquin to be in a sequel. Will that happen? Again, I just think the article was anticipatory at best.</blockquote>
