      <h1>Dean Smith tipped to controversially drop Aston Villa star for Newcastle United clash</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa news | Jack Grealish is fit to face Newcastle and pundit makes selection prediction</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Dean Smith will sacrifice Marvelous Nakamba to bring Jack Grealish back into the Aston Villa side, according to Darren Bent.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jack-grealish">Grealish</a> has missed the last three games in all competitions with a calf injury picked up in the defeat at Manchester City in October.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> beat Wolves in the Carabao Cup – a match which Grealish would have sat out anyway – but suffered Premier League defeats to Nuno Espirito Santo’s side and Liverpool without their talisman.</p>
      <p>Having been eased back into training, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jack-grealish-injury-aston-villa-17300862">Grealish is fit to play against Newcastle United on Monday night.</a></p>

      <p>Boss Dean Smith said: "Jack's been training with us, but I am a bit ill-at-ease to say he's been available because I've said it the last couple of weeks and he's not played, such has been his calf injury.</p>
      <p>"But he's trained with us for the last week so I have no doubts he will be there and in his happy place at Villa Park playing in front of the fans."</p>
      <p>Grealish excelled in a wide position in wins over Norwich City and Brighton before his injury yet Bent reckons <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Smith</a> will bring the 24-year-old back into a central role in midfield.</p>

      <p>That would present the head coach with a decision over who to drop and Bent told <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/exclusive-darren-bent-tips-villa-mainstay-for-axe-v-newcastle-after-behind-the-scenes-sighting/">Football Insider:</a> “Marvelous, I think. I like Douglas Luiz, I think he’s a good player, great technique on the ball and he’s been playing really well.</p>
      <p>“For me, it would be Douglas Luiz and Jack Grealish in the middle of the park because I think they’re better suited to each other – and of course John McGinn.”</p>
