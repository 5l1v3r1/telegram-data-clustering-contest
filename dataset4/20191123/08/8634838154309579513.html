        <b>State House Spokesperson Kanze Dena revealed how endeared gospel artist Rose Muhando had uplifted her spirits when the former <i>Citizen TV </i>anchor was experiencing a tough childhood.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking on Saturday, November 16, 2019, at Reverend Lucy Natasha's church in Nairobi, Kanze appreciated the <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/44278-rose-muhando-pours-her-heart-out-uhuru">talent Muhando possessed</a>.</p>
      <p>She also urged other gospel artistes to emulate the singer by releasing music that touches lives. </p>

      <p>"I want to speak about two things, one to Rose Muhando. I want to use her as an example. When I was a young girl I always listened to Rose’s songs. I listened to her music a lot when I was going through hardships. I used to cry listening to her song<i> Nipe Uvumilivu</i>,” she stated.</p>
      <p>She also touched on Muhando's tribulations, praying that she would rise to shine once again as she quoted Psalms 23.</p>
      <p>“When I heard something had happened to Rose, I prayed for her. When she came back is when I said that God is preparing a table before her enemies, that she will stand. Your cup is overflowing. You have gone through difficulties. You shall stand for the glory of God," Kanze addressed the singer who was in the audience. </p>
      <p>The musician composed a song for President Uhuru Kenyatta, dubbed <i>Kenya Ulindwe</i> which was posted on YouTube by her friend and Kenyan gospel musician, <b>Stephen Kasolo</b>, on Tuesday, September 24.</p>
      <p>"Thank you, Kenyatta and all the Kenyans for the love you showed me in Kenya during my sickness," Muhando sang. </p>
      <p>In an interview at <i>Radio Citizen</i> in October 2019, the Tanzanian singer alleged that her manager initiated her downfall and also deceived her of rightful earnings. </p>
      <p>The gospel artist found refuge in Kenya throughout her ailment. She was residing at Kenyan gospel artist, <b>Anastacia Mukabwa's</b>, house. </p>
      <p>That was her second song in her resurgance after featuring <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/41441-models-reject-ringtone-tv">controversial gospel musician</a> <b>Ringtone Apoko</b> in another song dubbed <i>'Walionicheka</i>' (Those who mocked me). </p>
      <p>In November 2018, she was urged by Tanzanians to go back home after she was prayed for by city pastor, James Ng'ang'a. The preacher allegedly <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/34925-rose-muhando-wanted-after-pastor-ngangas-exorcism-incident">cast out demons</a> from her. </p>
