      <p>Scientists have debunked the theory that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dogs/">dogs</a> age seven years for every one human year.</p>
      <p>University of California researchers say they have also found that puppies are middle-aged by the time they are two, although dogs tend to age more slowly than humans in later life.</p>
      <p>By the time they get to three – and are possibly still getting away with things due to being considered young – dogs are closer in age to a 50-year-old human, according to the university’s research.</p>

      <p>The study looked at how dogs aged by focusing on the DNA methylation in 104 Labradors aged between four weeks and 16 years.</p>
      <p>The DNA contains marks that change over time as a cell matures, allowing scientists to track the animal’s biological age.</p>

      <p>After assessing the dogs’ results, the researchers then compared their findings to those from 300 humans.</p>
      <p>An eight-week-old puppy was found to be the equivalent of a nine-month-old baby because of the stage at which they both develop their first teeth.</p>

      <p>By the age of two, the Labrador DNA was equivalent to a human in their early 40s, rather than the 14-year-old, which the traditional formula would suggest.</p>
      <p>However, ageing slows in dogs over time, meaning that by the age of 10, a Labrador is similar to a person aged 68.</p>
      <p>This ties in with the long-held formula for calculating the age of dogs, which was developed on the assumption that most canines lived until around 10, while humans lived until around 70.</p>
      <p>The researchers said: ‘The expected lifespan of Labrador retrievers, 12 years, correctly translated to the worldwide lifetime expectancy of humans, 70 years.’</p>

      <p>The scientists proposed a new method to work out a dog’s age – multiply the age in human years by 16 and then add 31.</p>
      <p>They said although the same formula will not apply to all types of dog but the concept of faster maturation was the same for all breeds.</p>
      <p>Smaller dogs mature faster and tend to live for longer.</p>
      <p>Chihuahuas can live for 20 years while medium-sized breeds typically reach between ten and 13 years old.</p>
      <p>Great Danes and other large dogs only have a life expectancy of between eight and ten years.</p>
