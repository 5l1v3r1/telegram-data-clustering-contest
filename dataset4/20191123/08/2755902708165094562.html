        <b>Fake Accounts On Twitter, Zimbabweans Fall Victim to lies and Fake News</b>
      </p>
      <p>Zimbabwe Social Media has been invaded by fake Twitter handles purporting to be credible organisations or government officials. These handles are spreading fake information or reply in a manner inconsistent with professional etiquette. This has become a cause for concern as the handles are identical to the official ones and in some cases causing a Public Relations Nightmare for affected organisations.</p>
      <p><a href="https://iharare.com/why-you-dont-mess-with-nandos/">Recently A Parody Nandos Account clapped back</a> at a disgruntled customer who had complained about poor services at one the Outlet’s branches in Borrowdale. Citizens were shocked at the response of Nandos and by the time it was discovered that the account was a parody, the damage had already been done with screenshots having gone viral on Social Media.</p>

      <p>Don’t Fall victim to these accounts, If you find the information too good to be true, It usually is. Legit handles are seen by the Number of Followers and are usually verified by a blue tick next to the name as shown below.</p>

      <p>In the event that an account is not verified, usually, the number of followers and content shared will give you an idea on the handle’s credibility.</p>
