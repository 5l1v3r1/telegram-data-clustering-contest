      <p>Kim Kardashian has become the first member of her family to speak about Caitlyn Jenner's stint in I'm A Celebrity.</p>
      <p>Reality star, entrepreneur and yummy mummy Kim took almost a week to acknowledge her former step father had stepped foot in the jungle.</p>
      <p>But instead of wishing Caitlyn, 70, good luck Skims founder Kim appeared to take a dig at the jungle star for her use of a morning greeting.</p>
      <p>Sharing a clip of ex Olympian Caitlyn addressing the camp using the now catchy <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kylie-jenner">Kylie Jenner</a> version of "Rise and Shine", Kim slyly wrote: "I literally recorded this and set this as my alarm a few weeks ago!"</p>

      <p>Although Caitlyn prefixed her morning wake up call with "Lets go team, it's not just another day, another day to excel, another day to be great."</p>
      <p>Youngest daughter Kylie famously drove fans crazy with her insanely catchy Rise and Shine greeting to wake baby Stormi up in October's You Tube video tour of her office.</p>

      <p>The video was viewed 4 million in its first day, 70 million times in its second day and one billion times by the end of the week.</p>
      <p>Fans were thrilled with Kim's tweet. One gushed: "I love Caitlin just as a fan, I canâ€™t imagine how fantastic she is as a part of your life."</p>

      <p>Another simply wrote: "Just support Jenner Kim."</p>
      <p>Although none of the Kardashians have spoken about their mum's ex, Caitlyn has been speaking affectionately about them, and even cried on the first day because she missed her grandchildren so much.</p>
