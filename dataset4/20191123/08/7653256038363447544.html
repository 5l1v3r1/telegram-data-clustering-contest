      <p>MUMBAI: Two years before the 2014 parliamentary polls the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Shiv-Sena">Shiv Sena</a> was hit by desertions as many mid-rung leaders were quitting the party every few months questioning the leadership of Uddhav Thackeray. Even as alarm bells began ringing, the 2014 parliamentary polls changed the Sena's falling graph and the party riding in the Narendra Modi wave performed well in the Lok Sabha polls.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s development where BJP’s <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Devendra-Fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis</a> was sworn in with NCP’s Ajit Pawar as the Deputy CM has come has come as a huge blow to the Shiv Sena and would see the party chief ending up with few cards to play.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena saw its tally come down from 63 in the 2014 polls to 56 in the 2019 polls. The Shiv Sena basically now is in danger of splitting if the Devendra Fadnavis government is able to prove its majority in the assembly. The BJP is claiming that there are more than 30 MLAs that own allegiance to Ajit Pawar and so they would be able to easily win the no confidence motion.</p>
      <p>BJP leader Girish Mahajan on Saturday said that the Sena MLAs are already in touch with the BJP to support the government. Many Sena MLAs were not keen on joining with the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/NCP">NCP</a> and abandoning the BJP,however they were pacified by the Shiv Sena leadership claiming that they would soon be in power with the NCP. These MLAs may jump ship.</p>
      <p>This however is just a small part of the Shiv Sena’s problems, as now it is not just without power, it is also without allies. The Congress and NCP had aligned with the Shiv Sena only to form a government and it is unlikely that the three parties would be part of an alliance that would sit in the Opposition. More worryingly for the Shiv Sena, the BMC civic poll is due in 2022 and an antagonistic BJP is going to go all out against the Sena in the civic polls. Throughout the years, the Sena has managed to sustain itself and be relevant in politics as it used to control the cash-rich civic body. If it loses this, too, then the Sena will find it quite hard to retain its mid-rung and senior leaders.</p>
      <p>The Sena's best bet is to see that the Devendra Fadnavis government loses the no confidence vote on the floor of the state assembly. Because, if the BJP wins there then it could be the start of the Sena's downward spiral.</p>
