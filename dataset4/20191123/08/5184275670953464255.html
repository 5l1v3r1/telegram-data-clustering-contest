It was yesterday when the makers unveiled the film’s first teaser. Post its release, the teaser has been trending all across the Internet.</p>
      <p>The 1 minute 26-second long teaser was a visual treat for cine-goers and Mahesh Babu fans. It won’t be wrong to say that the teaser looks so phenomenal that one just can’t get enough of the same. Be it Mahesh Babu’s intense and mass avatar, his action sequences or powerful dialogues. The teaser, as the makers and Mahesh wanted has successfully created a good impact and has given a great impression about their upcoming release among the audience.</p>
