      <p>Federal authorities in the United States have identified Nigerian businessman and founder of Air Peace Limited, Allen Onyema, as the mastermind of a series of fraudulent bank transactions spanning several years between the two countries.</p>
      <p>The money laundering and bank fraud charges against Mr Onyema, whose Air Peace Airlines is a major player in Nigeria’s domestic aviation, were filed by the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia.</p>
      <p>The United States Department of Justice <b><a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/364714-u-s-indicts-air-peace-chairman-allen-onyema-for-fraud.html">announced the allegations against Mr Onyema</a></b> on Friday night, saying he had been charged alongside Ejiroghene Eghagha, the company’s head of finance and administration.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the announcement, PREMIUM TIMES exclusively obtained the full dossier of Mr Onyema’s indictment, which was not made public by the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
      <p>The 36-page indictment showed that Mr Onyema was indicted by a United States federal grand jury following a lengthy investigation by law enforcement agents.</p>
      <p>The court filings said Mr Onyema’s suspicious moving of funds began in 2010 when he used a string of foundations he had set up to open bank accounts in the United States.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, Mr Onyema started moving funds from his foundations to conduct commercial transactions on behalf of his airlines and other businesses that federal authorities later found to be fictitious.</p>
      <p>He allegedly issued several fraudulent letters of credit to American banks through banks in Nigeria to purchase aircraft and equipment. American banks used included Bank of America and Wells Fargo and Bank of Montreal in Canada.</p>
      <p>Mr Onyema, whose national profile recently skyrocketed following his decision to fly stranded Nigerians back home from South Africa, also indulged in regular procurement of exotic vehicles and expensive fashion accessories, the indictment showed.</p>
      <p>American authorities estimated that Mr Onyema initiated wire transfers to the tune of $44.9 million between 2010 and 2018.</p>
      <p>If found guilty of the charges, Mr Onyema stands to forfeit about $14 million currently trapped in bank accounts linked to him in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
      <p>Messrs Onyema and Eghagha could not be reached for comment Saturday morning. A spokesperson for Air Peace was unavailable for comments.</p>

      </p>
      <p>1. Beginning on a date unknown, but at least as of May 2016 and continuing through at least February 2018, in the Northern District of Georgia and elsewhere, defendants ALLEN IFECHUKWU ATHAN ONYEMA, EJIROGHENE EGHAGHA, and others known and unknown to the Grand Jury, did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire, confederate, agree, and have a tacit understanding with each other and with others known and unknown to the Grand Jury, to commit bank fraud, an offence against the United States, that is to knowingly devise and execute and attempt to execute a scheme and artifice (i) to defraud financial institutions the deposits of which were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, that is, Wells Fargo Bank and JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, and (ii) to obtain and attempt to obtain moneys, funds, and assets owned by and under the custody and control of those financial institutions by means of materially false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises, as well as by omission of material facts, in violation of Title 18, United<br/>States Code, Section 1344.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Background</b>
      </p>
      <p>2. Defendant ALLEN IFECHUKWU ATHAN ONYEMA, a Nigerian citizen, is the founder and Chairman of several entities in Nigeria, including Foundation for Ethnic Harmony, International Center for Non-Violence and Peace Development, All-Time Peace Media Communications Limited, and Every Child Limited.</p>
      <p>3. Foundation for Ethnic Harmony is an organization founded by ONYEMA purportedly to promote harmonious co-existence among diverse ethnic groups in Nigeria through peace rallies, educational programming, and individual reorientation that encourages nonviolence and ethnic tolerance.</p>

      <p>5. All-Time Peace Media Communications Limited is a grassroots communication network founded by ONYEMA purportedly to create<br/>enlightenment for Nigerian people of all ages on the universal applicability and advantages of peace.</p>
      <p>
        <b>ONYEMA transferred funds from his Nigerian bank accounts to his personal bank accounts in the United States</b>
      </p>
      <p>6. In or around 2010, ONIEMA began frequently travelling to Atlanta, Georgia. From 2010 and continuing through 2017, ONYEMA travelled back and forth between Nigeria and Atlanta, Georgia to conduct various financial transactions.</p>
      <p>7. On or about April 2, 2010, Onyema opened a checking account ending in. 8086 in the name of Allen I. ONYEMA at a Bank of America branch in Atlanta, Georgia (“BOA 8086”). ONYRMA was the sole authorized signatory on the account. In or around August 2011, ONYEMA added his wife as a joint member to BOA 8086.</p>
      <p>8. Between April 2010 and January 2016, ONYEMA transferred millions of dollars into his BOA 8086 account from Nigerian and other foreign bank accounts, including hundreds of thousands of dollars transferred directly from accounts for Foundation for Ethnic Harmony, International Center for Non Violence and Peace Development, All-Time Peace Media Communications Limited, and Every Child Limited.</p>
      <p>9. ONYEMA used the funds in his BOA 8086 account to pay for personal living expenses, among other purchases. For example, Onyema purchased an armoured Lexus LX570 ($204,000.00), using, in part, funds from BOA 8086.</p>
      <p>10. In or about January 2016, Bank of America closed BOA 8086 and issued a cashier’s check in the amount of $4,000,396.43 made payable to ONYEMA and his wife.</p>

Both WF 3417 and WE 8020 were opened in the name of Allen I. ONYEMA, and ONYEMA was the sole authorized signatory on both accounts.</p>
      <p>12. On or about March 7, 2016, ONYEMA deposited the Bank of America cashier’s check into WE 8020. That same day, ONIEMA added his wife as a Secondary Joint Owner and authorized signatory to WE 8020 and WF 3417.</p>

Between on or about March 2, 2016, and May 10, 2016, Wells 8020 received numerous wire transfers totalling hundreds of thousands of dollars from his bank accounts domiciled in Nigeria, including but not limited to the bank account for All-Time Peace Media Communications Limited and Foundation for Ethnic Harmony.</p>
      <p>14. From March through May 2016, ONYEMA made numerous cash withdrawals from WF 8020 totalling hundreds of thousands of dollars. WE 3417 was used to pay for personal expenses, including purchases at Atlanta, Georgia locations of Prada, Neiman Marcus, Macy’s, Louis Vuitton, the Apple Store, and various airlines.</p>
      <p>15. In March 2016, ONIEMA also used WF 8020 to purchase luxury cars, including a Rolls Royce for $180,000 and a Mercedes for $88,500, among others. 16. On or about November 14, 2017, ONYEMA opened a business checking account ending in 5512 (“JPMC 5512”) and business savings account ending in 2151 (“JPMC 2151”) at a JP Morgan Chase Bank branch in Atlanta, Georgia.

      <p>to purchase these aircraft came from accounts for All-time Peace Media Communications, Foundation for Ethnic Harmony, Every Child Limited, and International Center for Non-Violence. The total amount of funds from these accounts used to purchase aircraft for Air Peace exceeded $3,000,000.</p>
      <p>21. Between 2013 and 2016, accounts associated with Foundation for Ethnic Harmony, International Center for Non-Violence and Peace Development, All-Time Peace Media Communications Limited, and Every Child Limited in Nigeria transferred more than $3.8 million into bank accounts in the United States to a combination of escrow, logistical, and personal accounts. The funds were used to acquire, export, and service aircraft, as well as to purchase personal property. ONYEMA founded and used Springfield Aviation Company, LEC to facilitate large transfers of funds from his Nigerian bank accounts to the United States</p>
      <p>22. On or about April 4, 2016, a business attorney, at the direction of ONYEMA, established Springfield Aviation Company, LLC (“Springfield<br/>Aviation”) as a Limited Liability Company registered in Atlanta, Georgia that purported to specialize in the wholesaling, trading, and sale of commercial aircraft and parts.
