      <h1>Teenager with lung condition forced to move out of damp-ridden South Shields council flat</h1>
      <h2>Chelsea Sanderson, 18, says she never wants to live in the flat ever again and is wanting to be relocated by the council</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Kieran Murray</a></address>
      <p>A teenager with chronic lung problems says she's been left with no choice but to leave her damp-infested flat which has rapidly declined into an 'unlivable' state.</p>
      <p>Chelsea Sanderson, 18, has vacated her <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/south-shields">South Shields</a> home after claiming her complaints to South Tyneside Council have been ignored now for more than eight months.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old has mental health issues, learning difficulties and suffers from a chronic lung condition, which left her relying on oxygen therapy for the first three years of her life.</p>

      <p>She moved into her Keats Walk home in March hoping for a fresh start after spending a number of months living in a hostel. Instead, she was handed an 'horrendous' one-bedroom property with a living room and storage cupboards full of damp and black mould.</p>
      <p>South Tyneside Homes says it would have carried out repairs in April had they been able to access the property for a pre-arranged appointment in April.</p>
      <p>As temperatures continue to plummet and Christmas just a matter of weeks away, Chelsea believes it is a far from ideal situation for a woman with her condition.</p>
      <p>Chelsea, who is currently doing a course in childcare, said: "The flat is always freezing, even when the heating is on. I had to move out because it was making me ill. My mental health has gone downhill. I feel like rubbish and I've not been eating properly.</p>
      <p>"It's been horrible to move into a place like this. I go back to the flat twice a day to check in on my kitten Snowy. It's been absolutely horrendous and I don't want to live there ever again."</p>
      <p>Chelsea moved out five months ago and has since been living between her parents' home and her girlfriend's place to escape the damp-ridden flat. She is now wanting to be rehomed closer to her family in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/byker">Byker</a>.</p>
      <p>Her father, William Howe, says it is a "disgrace" that <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/south-tyneside-council">South Tyneside Council</a> would allow anyone to live in the property.</p>
      <p>He said: "Chelsea suffers from body dysmorphia, PTSD and has self harmed in the past, while she also struggles with learning difficulties. This, coupled with her lung problems, makes the flat an incredibly dangerous place for her to be living.</p>

      <p>"I'm ex-forces and I've stayed in some bad places. I'd rather stay in any of those than in that flat. It's absolutely shocking and I can't believe the council would let her live there. As a responsible parent you just wouldn't let your child live there."</p>
      <p>After being contacted by ChronicleLive, South Tyneside Homes has agreed to send a surveyor to inspect the building next week.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for South Tyneside Homes said: "The property was inspected in March by a surveyor, who identified that vents were required in three hallway cupboards.</p>
      <p>"An appointment was made for the work to be carried out in April, however the team was unable to gain access to the flat.</p>
      <p>"A follow-up appointment was not made by the tenant as requested.</p>
      <p>"We will arrange for a surveyor to visit the property as soon as possible to assess what work or repairs are now needed."</p>
