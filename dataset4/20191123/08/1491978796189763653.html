Much of the protesters’ anger has focused on Chile’s 1980 constitution, which is seen as the embodiment of Augusto Pinochet’s neoliberal model, prioritising a market-driven economy but failing to adequately guarantee healthcare, education and pensions.</p>

Morales stepped down following nationwide protests over suspected vote-rigging in the 11 October election in which he claimed to have won a fourth term in office. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/17/bolivia-more-volatile-than-ever-as-president-flees-and-leaders-denounce-a-coup">But his departure, far from resolving Bolivia’s crisis, has only deepened it</a>. After his allies in the legislature resigned, the next in the line of succession was a rightwing Christian who served as deputy president of the senate, Jeanine Áñez.</p>
