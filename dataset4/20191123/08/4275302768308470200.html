      <h1>Hopes high that House of Angus store will reopen after lying empty for two years</h1>
      <h2>Hopes are high that a large retail unit on the border between Dundee and Angus could re-open after lying vacant for two years.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:45:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/jimmillar/" target="_blank">Jim Millar</a></address>
      <p>A spokesperson for gardening giant Dobbies has confirmed the firm is in final discussions with two parties for the empty House of Angus store, which is part of its complex near Monifieth.</p>
      <p>The shop closed early last year and at the time Dobbies said there were “exciting plans” in the pipeline.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/angus-mearns/776600/hopes-for-festive-angus-jobs-bonanza-dashed/">The firm later outlined an investment of around £700,000 and plans to create up to 40</a> jobs at the site. The intention was to have the centre ready to trade over the Christmas season last year.</p>

      <p>However the scheme, which would have seen the unit rebranded as an Edinburgh Woollen Mill destination centre, failed to materialise.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Dobbies said this week: “We are conducting final discussions with two parties for our empty unit at House of Angus and are committed to finding a solution which will make best use of the space.</p>
      <p>“We will announce our plans as soon as we are in a position to update.”</p>
      <p>Monifieth and Sidlaw SNP councillor, Beth Whiteside, who has been pressing the company to make use of the site, said: “The news that progress is being made is to be welcomed, but the fact is that we have been here before and nothing has happened.</p>
      <p>“This retail unit is important for both Dundee and Angus, but it is now starting to look a bit shabby.</p>
      <p>“This situation has been going on for too long now and although I appreciate the retail sector is operating in a challenging environment, this is a prime site that could be creating jobs and boosting the local economy.”</p>
      <p>She said officers from Angus Council’s economic development department were ready to give any assistance they can, adding: “I would urge Dobbies to do everything possible to expedite bringing the House of Angus back into use.”</p>
      <p>The outlet first opened in 1999 and featured a number of local and household names, including farm shop Gray Retail Ltd, luggage specialist Antler and soap and fragrance manufacturer Arran Aromatics.</p>
