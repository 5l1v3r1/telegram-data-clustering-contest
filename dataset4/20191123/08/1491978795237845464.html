        <i>The new Elena Ferrante is just one of the exciting novels in translation coming next year. Lara Feigel talks to the UK editors who are rediscovering classics and finding new audiences</i>
      </p>
      <p>There are voices that speak to us across oceans and centuries with more intimacy than the people who surround us in our daily lives. These can speak directly with clarity and honesty: think of Elena Ferrante, whose feverishly awaited new novel <i>The Lying Life of Adults</i> is written from the perspective of an adolescent girl disillusioned by the “unreliable animals” inhabiting the adult world; or Natalia Ginzburg, writing in<i> The Little Virtues</i> that after the war “we cannot lie in our books and we cannot lie in any of the things we do”. They can speak meanderingly out of troubled nights, entering our dreams: think of Vigdis Hjorth, writing in <i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/22/will-and-testament-by-vigdis-hjorth-review">Will and Testament</a></i> that “it is terrible that someone who has been destroyed spreads destruction, and how hard that is to avoid”. Or they can speak precisely and carefully, allowing us to access our own hopes and fears by describing material surroundings in minute detail. In <i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/20/territory-of-light-yuko-tsushima-review-tokyo-tales">Territory of Light</a></i>, Yūko Tsushima’s autobiographical tale of motherhood in the wake of divorce, there are long descriptions of the flat where she lives alone with her daughter: “The apartment was filled with light at any hour of the day.”</p>
      <p>From postwar Italy, from contemporary Norway, from 1970s Japan, these narrators speak of love, suffering and domestic labour. That we have access to these voices now is thanks to the work of translators and editors committed to bringing more women into the canon, to making the British literary world less parochial and to reminding us that contemporary trends such as autofiction are richly rooted in the past. Thanks to their efforts, consumption of translated works in Britain is on the rise. Since 2012, when it first became common to see people reading <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/11/karl-ove-knausgaard-interview-spring-my-struggle">Karl Ove Knausgaard </a>and Ferrante’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/nov/07/elena-ferrante-naples-footsteps-my-brilliant-friend-photo-essay">Neapolitan Quartet</a> on the tube, sales of translated fiction have steadily increased. Overall sales in the UK were up last year by 5.5%, with more than 2.6m books sold, while sales of translated literary fiction shot up by 20%.</p>

      <p>Why now, we might ask. The unexpected phenomena of Knausgaard and Ferrante had something to do with it. As readers lurched compulsively from one volume of their very different struggles to the next, we could be lured easily to Ginzburg as Ferrante’s foremother and Hjorth as a welcome female perspective on the dysfunctional Norwegian families Knausgaard made so fascinating.</p>
      <p>Then there was Brexit. For those of us who voted remain there was perhaps a moment of guilt amid the outrage, as we wondered if we were quite as European as we liked to think. Who is the Ali Smith, the Rachel Cusk, the Deborah Levy of France, Germany, Italy, Poland or Hungary?</p>
      <p>I, for one, didn’t know the answers back in 2016. For decades, the European writers I’d read regularly were more often male than female, more often writers who treated domestic life as suffused with grand themes and emphatic political magnitude. I had taken the canon I’d been given as an undergraduate – Goethe and Mann, Flaubert and Proust – without questioning its assumptions. Now I wanted a fuller and more lively sense of our shared European heritage, and I was grateful to the publishers who were making that possible. Over the past few years, as well as Ernaux and Ginzburg, I’ve discovered the Belgian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/14/marie-madeleine-bourdouxhe-review">Madeleine Bourdouxhe</a>, who spent long periods of her life in France, and the Danish <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/16/the-copenhagen-tirlogy-by-tove-ditlevsen-review">Tove Ditlevsen</a>: a community of feminist writers committed to ordinary experience who cross borders of time and place.</p>
      <p>Smaller independent publishers have played a vital role in this, publishing translations not as fusty classics with quietly collectable covers, but as bold and vibrant new arrivals, ready to enter our contemporary scene as equal players.</p>

        <figcaption>Completely compelling … Natalia Ginzburg.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The rediscovery of Natalia Ginzburg has been the work of Željka Marošević at Daunt Books. Marošević (herself an immigrant from Bosnia who remains committed to breaking down national borders) made her name by bringing Maggie Nelson, author of<i> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/23/the-argonauts-maggie-nelson-review-harry-dodge-transgender">The Argonauts</a></i>, to the British public in 2016, when Marošević was in her early 20s. It was Nelson who introduced her to Ginzburg, whom she found immediately compelling. She published <i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/25/the-little-virtues-by-natalia-ginzburg-review">The Little Virtues</a></i> with an introduction by Cusk, whom Marošević wanted to show as writing autofiction that had links and parallels with European literature across previous decades. And then she published a series of novels, with Ginzburg’s <i>Happiness, As Such</i> just out in a new translation by Minna Zallman Proctor.</p>
      <p>I ask Marošević what she thinks is behind the current enthusiasm for books from the past. “My generation thinks differently about the canon,” she says. “We think in terms of the personal canon. Which writers speak to our lives? And if we look back, we’re probably seeing some of those writers out of print.” This is also the view of Ella Griffiths, recently appointed to a newly created post at Faber overseeing the backlist, who wants to make Faber’s classics publishing “more diverse, less Eurocentric, more exciting”. She’s got her eye on Banana Yoshimoto (the pen name of the feminist Japanese writer Mahoko Yoshimoto) and French writers Amélie Nothomb and Marie Darrieussecq. “You should open the book and it should feel vital and direct,” Griffiths tells me; “like having a telephone line to that author.”</p>
      <aside>Postwar female writers used the grit of their lives and the rubble of a world that had been bombed to forge hard-won works of art</aside>
      <p>For young feminists, these books also perhaps provide a reprieve from the exhaustion of online identity politics. Ginzburg and Ditlevsen speak from a world that was less polemically frontloaded, less binary in its moral positions and therefore arguably more vital than ours. These postwar female European writers used the grit of their lives and the rubble of a world that had been smashed and bombed to the ground to forge hard-won works of art.</p>
      <p>We may need that literature as the ruins become visible again now. As our political edifices teeter, the war-sharpened sensitivities of Ginzburg and Ditlevsen can help us to sharpen our own. And in so doing, we need to create ourselves anew as Europeans. However much many of us want to remain in the EU, it’s still an imperfect and not particularly lovable entity (those scenes where dark suited European alpha males slapped Johnson on the back were as complacently patriarchal as much that we witness in the White House). As we fight to retain trade links with Europe, we need to fight too to forge a new and more vibrant vision of being European. Looking back on the origins of the EU, its architect Jean Monnet said, “If I were starting over, I would begin with culture”. Perhaps, at this moment when it looks like we are starting again, this is just what we need to do.</p>
      <p>There are three European books published this autumn that take us back to that postwar world, when a new Europe and a new art were being forged from the rubble. At Pushkin – one of the forerunners among independent publishers of books in translation – publisher Laura Macaulay brings us Bourdouxhe’s collection, <i>A Nail, A Rose</i>, translated by Faith Evans. These stories are often dream-like but are centred on the daily life of women. In “Louise” (first published in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/25/les-temps-modernes-closed-paris-mourns-de-beauvoir-journal">Les Temps Modernes</a> in 1947 by Simone de Beauvoir, a friend of Bourdouxhe’s), the opening sentences inform us that “when melted sugar falls on to the steel surface of a stove it’s the very devil, it sticks like glue. To get it off you need steel wool and an emery cloth.” The sensations of motherhood are quietly but acutely described. We’re told that Louise’s child gives her “warmth, a presence and a reason for living” but doesn’t offer relief from care: “she was more like a tender burden”. The closing, magnificent story “<i>Sous le Pont Mirabeau</i>” describes a new baby born in the middle of war. The detail of teaching the baby to breastfeed gets as much space as the war scenes, which accrue poignancy from the intense bodily life flowing through them.</p>
      <p>There are scenes of new motherhood, too, in Ginzburg’s <i>Happiness, As Such</i>, published in July, and in Ditlevsen’s 60s The Copenhagen Trilogy, recently published by Penguin in a translation by Tiina Nunnally and Michael Favala Goldman. Ginzburg’s novel is comprised of letters written between members of a disintegrating family. It begins with a middle-aged mother writing half-resentfully, half-lovingly to her son Michele as he moves from Italy to England. The language is as direct as ever. “After a certain point in life a person has to dunk her regrets in the morning coffee, just like biscuits,” she writes, while managing to blame her son for her disappointment nonetheless.</p>
      <p>The most memorable character here is Mara, the petulant new mother of a baby who might be Michele’s. In a novel filled with opportunists, Mara is the most grandly opportunistic of all, determined to use anyone she encounters to supply free accommodation and provide her with company while she feeds her baby, which she finds depressing when she is alone. She’s curiously vibrant, though, more so than the more insistently refined family of her former lover. And eventually Michele’s family realise this enough to befriend Mara, even though it seems unlikely the baby is actually his. It is to Mara that Michele’s sister says the line (there’s always one of these in a Ginzburg novel) that cuts through to the misery underlying all this and in so doing offers a kind of hard-won hope. “We’re all unreliable and broken somewhere inside and sometimes it seems desperately attractive to be unrooted and breathing nothing but your own solitude. That’s how people find each other, and understand.”</p>

      <p>For Ditlevsen, hope of this kind occurs less often through connection with others than through writing. The Copenhagen Trilogy is a catalogue of casual brutality and exploitation. The young Tove is told by an early mentor that everyone is trying to use each other for something, and Ditlevsen is open in taking this on as a way of life. In a <i>Moll Flanders</i>-like tale of chaotic multiple marriages that echoes the patterns of her own life, Ditlevsen uses one husband to get published, another to have a child, and another to procure the drugs that he (a doctor) gets her addicted to by offering her a shot of the opioid Demerol in their first sexual encounter.</p>
      <p>In the process, she loses as much as she gains from these men, becoming increasingly vulnerable to pain. However, as in much of the best autofiction, the protagonist’s weakness is counterpoised by the strength of her voice – indeed the tenacity of that voice may in odd ways rely on the flaws of character that it lights up. This is a woman who, even when exhausted by her menial jobs, frightened by European politics (the trilogy begins during Hitler’s rise to power) or incarcerated in a mental asylum, knows her own power. “On the sly, you observe the adults whose childhood lies inside them, torn and full of holes like a used and moth-eaten rug no one thinks about anymore or has any use for,” she observes as a child. And as an adult, she is still observing slyly, speaking beyond the cruel and disappointing figures she encounters to us, her readers, awaiting her in another time and another place</p>
