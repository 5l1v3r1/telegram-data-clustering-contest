      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> has opened up about feeling ‘insecure’ about her 2013 Met Gala dress, admitting she cried when she saw memes about it.</p>
      <p>Safe to say, the memes were a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/18/kylie-jenner-cashing-viral-meme-releasing-rise-shine-merch-course-10939488/">lot less kind than Rise and Shine.</a></p>
      <p>The star, who is known for her bold looks at the event, was worried about how she would look because she was pregnant with her daughter North.</p>
      <p>‘I was very pregnant, very puffy and bloated and I was like, “Oh god, of course the first time I go I’m gonna be huge,”‘ she said, explaining that she wasn’t actually invited but went as her husband <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kanye-west/">Kanye West</a>’s plus one.</p>

      <p>Designer Riccardo Tisci made sure she was wearing a stretchy fabric to be comfortable, but the public reaction wasn’t quite what she expected.</p>
      <p>Of course, memes began to circulate, with even celebs like Robin Williams getting in on the joke.</p>

      <p>‘I think Robin Williams even tweeted it, said I looked like Mrs Doubtfire,’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Knj8-MKFn8">Kim told Vogue</a>. ‘I was crying the whole way home because I just couldn’t believe it.’</p>
      <p>Adding that she would have rather gone with the plain black version of the dress, she said: ‘I could never really speak up at that point because I so shy and just wanted to make everybody happy.’</p>

      <p>However, despite the public generally loving her outfit this year, it still wasn’t without a bit of stress on her part, due to a disagreement with Kanye.</p>
      <p>A recent episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/kim-kardashians-thierry-mugler-met-gala-dress-originally-fake-nipples-attached-11055671/">showed a row between Kim and Kanye about the sexiness of the custom corseted Thierry Mugler</a> dress for May’s fashion gala.</p>
      <p>The mother-of-four said: ‘Well, the dress initially, since I was wet coming out of the water, there were nipples attached to it. I think with editing I don’t know, I’m not sure if we actually put that part into that fight.</p>
      <p>‘So, he was really certain that he didn’t want that on the dress and had mentioned it multiple times. And that was still on there so we did have that discussion.’</p>

      <p>Fake nipples aside, she still looked absolutely stunning.</p>
