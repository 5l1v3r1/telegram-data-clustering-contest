      <p>TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan and South Korea have agreed to hold a summit next month, a Japanese foreign ministry official said on Saturday, returning to contentious talks about their painful wartime past that have put a deep strain on relations in recent months.</p>
      <p>Neither side has shown any sign of changing their stance on the issue - which dates back to Japan’s colonization of the Korean peninsula before and during World War Two.</p>
      <p>The foreign ministry official made the comments after Japan’s foreign minister met with his South Korean counterpart at a Group of 20 (G20) meeting in the central Japanese city of Nagoya.</p>
