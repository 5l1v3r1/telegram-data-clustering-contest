      <p>MONTREAL: Russia faces a new international sporting ban after a key World Anti-Doping Agency panel recommended the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) be declared non-compliant, a statement said Friday (Nov 22).</p>
      <p>WADA said its Compliance Review Committee (CRC) had recommended that RUSADA be suspended again when the global anti-doping watchdog's Executive Committee meets in Paris on DecÂ 9.</p>

      <p>If the WADA leadership adopts the recommendation, Russia faces fresh sanctions including a likely ban from next year's Olympics in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>The CRC issued its recommendation after asking Russia to explain "inconsistencies" in laboratory data handed over by Moscow to WADA investigators in January.</p>
      <p>Full disclosure of data from the Moscow laboratory was a key condition of Russia's reinstatement by WADA in September 2018.</p>
      <p>RUSADA had been suspended for nearly three years previously over revelations including a systematic conspiracy to switch tainted samples at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.</p>
      <p>WADA had previously warned Russia would face the "most stringent sanctions" if any of the data handed over was found to have been tampered with.</p>
      <p>In an interview with AFP last month, RUSADA's chief Yuri Ganus said he expected Russia to receive a lengthy Olympic ban, blasting Moscow authorities who he accused of handing over falsified lab data.</p>
      <p>"Russia's Olympic squad will be prevented from participating fully in the Olympic Games in Tokyo.... I think that this will also happen at the (Winter Olympic) Games in China," Ganus told AFP.</p>
      <p>Ganus said he expected a range of other penalties too, including restrictions on holding international tournaments in Russia, exclusion of Russians from international sports federations and fines.</p>
      <p>Ganus later said RUSADA officials had not been responsible for falsifying the data, insisting his staff "had nothing to do with the database and its transfer."</p>
      <p>He instead blamed "forces outside RUSADA" for the incomplete data.</p>
      <p>Russian Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov earlier this month denied allegations that the data had been tampered with.</p>
      <p>Kolobkov said Russian experts "consider nothing was removed" from the material handed over to WADA.</p>
      <p>Addressing Ganus's claims directly, Kolobkov added: "There was not any manipulation as the head of Russia's anti-doping laboratory, Yuri Ganus, says. That's our position."</p>
