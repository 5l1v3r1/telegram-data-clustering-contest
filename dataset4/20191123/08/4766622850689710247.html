      <p>Young women who use diet pills and laxatives for weight control are at higher risk of receiving <a href="https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/5-types-of-eating-disorder-you-need-to-know-about-674570/">eating disorder </a>diagnosis within one to three years, suggests a recent study.</p>
      <p>“We’ve known that diet pills and laxatives when used for weight control can be very harmful substances. We wanted to find out if these products could be a gateway behaviour that could lead to an eating order diagnosis,” said senior author S. Bryn Austin, a professor in the Department of Social and Behavioural Sciences at Harvard Chan School and director of STRIPED (Strategic Training Initiative for the <a href="https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/autism-eating-disorders-and-nutrition-figure-out-the-link-672328/">Prevention of Eating Disorders</a>).</p>
      <p>“Our findings parallel what we’ve known to be true with tobacco and alcohol: starting harmful substances can set young people on a path to worsening problems, including serious substance abuse disorder,” added Austin from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Boston Children’s Hospital.</p>
      <p>The study published in the — American Journal of Public Health (AJPH).</p>
      <p>Use of over-the-counter diet pills or laxatives is not recommended by health care providers as a healthy way to manage weight and can have severe health consequences, including high blood pressure and liver and kidney damage.</p>
      <p>The researchers analysed data from 10,058 women and girls ages 14 to 36 who participated in the U.S.-based Growing Up Today Study (GUTS) from 2001 to 2016.</p>
      <p>They found that among participants without an eating disorder, 1.8% of those who used diet pills during the past year reported receiving a first eating disorder diagnosis during the next one to three years compared to 1% of those who did not use the products.</p>
      <p>They also found that among these participants, 4.2% of those who used laxatives for weight control received a subsequent first eating disorder diagnosis compared to 0.8% of those who did not use these products for weight control.</p>
      <p>The researchers called for policies that restrict access to these products, including banning the sale of diet pills to minors.</p>
      <p>They write that the use of these products for weight control may serve as a “gateway” to further disordered eating practices by dysregulating normal digestive function and fostering dependence on unhealthy and ineffective coping methods.</p>
      <p>“Our findings are a wake-up call about the serious risks of these products. Instagram took a step in the right direction recently by banning ads to minors for over-the-counter diet pills and ‘detox’ teas, which are often laxatives,” said first author Jordan Levinson.</p>
      <p>“It’s time for retailers and policymakers to take the dangers of these products seriously and take steps to protect youth,” concluded Levinson.</p>
