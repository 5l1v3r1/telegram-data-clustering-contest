      <p>On paper, a Yorkshire pudding wrap is all kinds of wrong.</p>
      <p>If it ain't broke, don't fix it after all, and there's definitely nothing wrong with a good old fashioned roast dinner served on a plate.</p>
      <p>So it was a brave move by the family-owned JMF Catering to mix things up by introducing the alternative to the British classic, which sees meat and all the trimmings encased in a giant Yorkshire pud.</p>
      <p>After first unveiling the creation at Bristol <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> Market in 2015 to widespread acclaim, the family then took it on the road, serving it at events up and down the country to satisfied customers.</p>
      <p>This year marks the fourth year on the trot that they are serving their festive delicacy at Bristol's German market - which is also home to plenty of other food stands worth visiting - and there most definitely hasn't been a dip in quality.</p>
      <p>Far from it, in fact, as the wrap I had for lunch on Thursday was even tastier than the one I devoured last year.</p>
      <h3>Far from a gimmick</h3>

      <p>As I waited it to be made by the friendly team I listened to passers-by as they commented on the stand, and it would be fair to say opinions were split.</p>
      <p>Some people said what a good idea it was and others turned their nose up at it, presumably writing it off as somewhat gimmicky.</p>
      <p>To those in the latter of the two categories, I strongly suggest ordering one at the next opportunity to see how wrong you've been.</p>
      <p>I ordered the pork option (there's also ham, beef and turkey to choose from) along with crackling for £6.50.</p>
      <p>It was fairly busy but I only had to wait a few minutes for the wrap to be made. Even if it had been a 20-minute wait, it would have been worth it.</p>
      <h3>High quality ingredients</h3>

      <p>While roast dinners are of course delicious, the downside is that you have to eat all the components separately, unless you're an expert at balancing multiple ingredients on your fork.</p>
      <p>The beauty with the Yorkshire pudding wrap, however, is that every bite is filled with all the goodness mixed together, including a delightful apple sauce (optional but highly recommended).</p>
      <p>You would perhaps be forgiven for thinking that the ingredients used to form the wraps are low in quality, but you would be wide of the mark. This is far from a gimmick.</p>
      <p>The meat, business manager Neil tells me, is supplied by Easter Compton Farm Shop on the outskirts of Bristol while the vegetables are locally sourced too, he said.</p>
      <p>And while he could well have been telling porkies, I could taste for myself that he wasn't as the meat was wonderfully succulent and the veg fresh.</p>
      <p>The real piece de resistance, though, was the crackling, which was nice and crunchy but not to the point it put me in danger of chipping a tooth.</p>
      <p>Crackling doused in gravy is an absolute joy, as any roast dinner connoisseur will tell you.</p>
      <p>All in all for £6.50, it is a delightfully festive lunch for those on the go at the Christmas market, although don't forget there are many other culinary treats worth sampling too.</p>
