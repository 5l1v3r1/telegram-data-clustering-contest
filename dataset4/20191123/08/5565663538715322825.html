      <p>The return of General Constantino Chiwenga back into the country has excited many Zimbabweans, with many raising hopes that the General has come to fix the country that he took over from the late President Robert Mugabe. <br/><br/>General Chiwenga looks as fit as a fiddle after having suffered from severe poisoning which nearly cost him his life. <br/><br/>There are already calls on social media streets for a General Chiwenga/Saviour Kasukuwere combination for the good of the ordinary man on the streets.  It is highly likely that General Chiwenga will work together with Saviour Kasukuwere to rebuild both his party ZANU PF and fix the mess that has been created by Emmerson Munangagwa's goons. <br/><br/>Every day calls get loud from the <a href="https://bulawayo24.com/index-id-search-keyword-Tysonwabantu.html">#Tysonwabantu</a> campaign for Saviour Kasukuwere to come and lead a young people centred movement. Videos circulating on social media indicate that people as far Uzumba Maramba Pfungwe have embraced the <a href="https://bulawayo24.com/index-id-search-keyword-Tysonwabantu.html">#Tysonwabantu</a> message. <br/>General Chiwenga remains a key player in the post Mugabe era.<br/><br/>Saviour Kasukuwere is a grassroots oriented politician who  commands respect within ZANU PF structures and has worked well with young while  General Chiwenga is a veteran in the security sector. <br/><br/>Many have said General Chiwenga is a man with a soft heart and a listening ear seemingly in line with the testimony from the young people about Saviour Kasukuwere.  <br/><br/>It remains to be seem if these two men will work together. <br/><br/>Sources close to both camps have revealed that the two men met recently, with Saviour Kasukuwere making a trip to China two weeks ago and General Chiwenga stopping over in Cape Town on his way back to Zimbabwe.<br/><br/>Recent activities have seen ZANU PF structures from Manicaland, Bulawayo, Mashonaland Central, Mashonaland East and Mashonaland West calling for the reinstatement of Saviour Kasukuwere back into the party. <br/><br/>The concern of the ordinary citizen on the street is having food on the table, doctors in hospitals, peace on the streets and leaders who lead with love.  <br/><br/>A combination these two men is likely to affect the political life line of Nelson Chamisa, whom many are saying he has failed to provide resolute leadership in time of great need. However political analysts have stated that there need for both General Chiwenga and Saviour Kasukuwere, as they work together, to engage with Nelson Chamisa in order to unite all Zimbabweans. <br/><br/>Exciting times ahead, both General Chiwenga and Saviour Kasukuwere have never known to disappoint the masses who are excited and fully  behind them.</p>
