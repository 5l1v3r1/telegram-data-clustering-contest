      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:41:57+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/arushi-jain/" target="_blank">Arushi Jain</a></address>
      <p>If you have Ajay-Atul’s name attached to a film’s music, you can stay assured that there will be no mediocre tunes. The music composer duo makes sure to make their compositions the high point of a film and this is what they have done with Panipat’s song “Mann Mein Shiva”.</p>
      <p>“Mann Mein Shiva” has everything, from rhythm, the sound of traditional musical instruments that give it a folk touch, impressive vocals by Kunal Ganjawala, Deepanshi Nagar, Padmanabh Gaikwad, a chorus and meaningful lyrics (which have become a rarity in Bollywood music) by Javed Akhtar. Where the song lags, is in its visualisation. The picturisation of the song does not leave the same impact as its audio.</p>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/arjun-kapoor/">Arjun Kapoor</a> as Sadashiv Rao Bhau offers his respect to Lord Shiva and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj before leaving for the battlefield. He is joined by his wife Parvati Bai played by <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/kriti-sanon/">Kriti Sanon</a>.</p>

      <p>However, the song has all the abilities to grow on the listeners and be a hit during religious festivities.</p>
      <p>Ajay-Atul have earlier created music for Bollywood films like Agneepath, Singham, Dhadak, Zero, Super 30 and others.</p>
      <p>Directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, the historical drama Panipat is based on the Third Battle of Panipat, which was fought between Marathas and Afghans in 1761. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sanjay-dutt/">Sanjay Dutt</a> plays the role of Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah Abdali and Zeenat Aman, Mohnsih Bahl and Padmani Kolhapuri star in pivotal roles too.</p>
      <p>Talking about the film, Arjun Kapoor had earlier said, “Panipat is the story of Maratha valour. And how they were the leaders who made sure we took on Afghans. It is a brilliant film and Ashutosh has made it with a lot of passion.”</p>
      <p>Panipat releases on December 6. It will face a box office clash with Pati Patni Aur Woh.</p>
