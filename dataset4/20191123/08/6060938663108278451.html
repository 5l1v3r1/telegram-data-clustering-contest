      <p>BRISBANE: Australia look certain to take a 1-0 lead in their series against Pakistan after dominating with both bat and ball on day three of the first Test in Brisbane on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Big centuries to Marnus Labuschagne (185) and David Warner (154) helped Australia to a first innings total of 580 in reply to Pakistan's 240.</p>
      <p>At stumps Pakistan were in big trouble on 64 for three, still needing 276 runs to make Australia bat again.</p>

          <b>SCORECARD</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Shan Masood was not out 27 and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Babar-Azam">Babar Azam</a> was 20 at the close.</p>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mitchell-Starc">Mitchell Starc</a> did the early damage for the Australians in the final hour of the day's play, trapping captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Azhar-Ali">Azhar Ali</a> leg before for five.</p>
      <p>He then enticed Haris Sohail to waft at a ball well outside off stump, only to get a thick edge to Australian wicketkeeper Tim Paine.</p>
      <p>Asad Shafiq was next to fall, edging <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/pat-cummins">Pat Cummins</a> to second slip where Steve Smith took a comfortable catch.</p>
      <p>Labuschagne had earlier scored a magnificent maiden Test century in front of his home crowd at the Gabba.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old made history during the Ashes series earlier this year when he was brought into the second Test as a concussion replacement for Steve Smith, who had been hit in the head by a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Jofra-Archer">Jofra Archer</a> bouncer.</p>
      <p>It was the first time a concussion replacement had been used in Test cricket since the new law was introduced.</p>
      <p>Labuschagne scored four 50s in that series but had been unable to convert any of those until his near chanceless innings on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Earlier, teenage pace sensation Naseem Shah claimed his first Test wicket when he had Warner caught behind for 154.</p>
      <p>Warner only added three runs to his overnight score of 151 when he became 16-year-old Naseem's first scalp.</p>
      <p>Naseem, whose pace has been impressive during this Test, eventually claimed Warner when the nuggety opener was unable to avoid a short pitched ball and edged it to wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan, to leave the Australians 351 for two.</p>
      <p>But that was the last hurrah from Naseem, who appeared to be injured and only bowled four overs in the day.</p>
      <p>The Pakistanis' hearts must have sunk when they saw Smith striding to the crease to replace Warner.</p>
      <p>But after hitting a boundary off <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Yasir-Shah">Yasir Shah</a>, the leg-spinner then clean bowled Smith, the seventh time in six Test matches that Yasir has dismissed the Australian number four.</p>
      <p>Labuschagne and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Matthew-Wade">Matthew Wade</a> shared in a 110-run partnership before Wade was well caught by Rizwan for 60 off Sohail.</p>
      <p>Sohail and Rizwan then combined to have Travis Head caught down the leg side for 24.</p>
      <p>The Pakistan bowlers toiled hard throughout the day and were rewarded when they took the last five Australian wickets for 35 runs, with Yasir (4-205) and Shaheen Afridi (2-96) the pick.</p>
