      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Halo: Reach on PC will support uncapped framerates when it launches December 3, 2019.</li>
        <li>In addition, many other facets of the game are being improved.</li>
        <li>The launch of the game will also see a massive update for the title's Forge level editor.</li>
        <li>Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary on PC will enter testing phases early in 2020.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Halo: Reach on PC is launching on December 3, 2019, and developer 343 Industries has released a <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/mcc-development-update-november-2019">blog post</a> that gives a detailed overview about how the launch version of the game will have various improvements over the builds of the title used in test flights.</p>
      <p>The biggest news is that Halo: Reach on PC is confirmed to support variable framerate (VFR) out of the gate, which essentially means that you can push your framerate as high as your monitor's refresh rate and your system's hardware will allow. This is excellent news, as the ability to push frames-per-second (FPS) past the standard 60 is considered a crucial feature to have in many PC gaming communities. That's not all, though â€” mouse input speed and accuracy problems, audio and V-Sync bugs, user interface crashes, and server connection issues are all being taken care of for the game's launch, and a Push-To-Talk key is being added, too. Additionally, 343 plans to tweak things such as controller aim assist on PC over time, as well as increase the amount of servers that support the title.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In addition to all of the improvements mentioned above, 343 Industries is also adding in a ton of brand new Forge objects to Halo: Reach, both for the PC version and for the Xbox One version being added to the Master Chief Collection on the same day of the PC launch. These objects include new space vehicles like the Sabre and Seraph from the Campaign, as well as civilian vehicles and set pieces that were previously only visible in Campaign levels or developer-made multiplayer maps. As an added bonus, players will also be able to place more objects than they could in the Xbox 360 version of the title as well.</p>
