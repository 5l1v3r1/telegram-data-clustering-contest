      <p>We usually talk about a woman’s biological clock ticking. <b><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/parenting/health-fitness/yes-you-can-have-a-baby-after-the-age-of-35-but-should-you-5364048/">Pregnancy after 35</a></b> can entail physical complications that can hamper fertility. Turns out, it is not just women; men have a biological cycle too.</p>
      <p>So, what is the difference between male and female biological cycles? Here’s what gynecologist and fertility specialist Dr Rita Bakshi explained.</p>
      <h3>Female biological cycle</h3>
      <p>Women are born with a limited egg reserve and lose about 1,000 eggs every single month. So, by the time a woman reaches the age of 30-35, she has lost most of her fertility. With rising age, the <b><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/parenting/health-fitness/common-causes-of-miscarriage-here-are-things-to-know-5767874/">risk of miscarriage</a></b> and abnormalities in the baby also increases.</p>
      <h3>Male biological cycle</h3>
      <p>In the case of a man, however, produce sperms every three months. But after the age of 40, a man’s clock also slows down, impacting the chances of pregnancy. So, while <b><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/parenting/health-fitness/fathers-age-linked-to-birth-defects-5261879/">age affects fertility</a></b> in both women and men, the impact is seen more in the former.</p>
      <p>A woman cannot think of conceiving naturally after menopause unlike men who can impregnate women up to 60-65 and maybe even lifelong. However, there is definite DNA fragmentation of the sperm head with increasing age, resulting in higher chances of having embryos that are likely to abort. Children born to fathers above the age of 50 also have a higher risk of developing autism.</p>
