      <p>The Marvel Universe is full of massive and powerful cosmic deities, many of whom have actively tried to destroy humanity on multiple occasions. There are a handful however that have made it their purpose to help protect life on the planet.</p>
      <p>One of those benevolent figures is Uatu the Watcher. However, it seems that at least in the 2099 universe, he doesn't get any just reward for these acts. Instead, he's captured and turned into a tool by Doctor Doom.</p>

      <h3>THE WATCHER SEES ALL</h3>

      <p>Uatu was first introduced by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby as one of the kinder cosmic deities that the Fantastic Four encountered in their exploration of the cosmos. He is one of the ancient beings known as the Watchers, a multiversal species of cosmic level beings who choose to use their powers to watch over all of creation. They have taken a vow of non-interference, which technically forbids them from interacting in any way with the peoples of their respective universes.</p>
      <p>However, Uatu is different. Having grown fond of the beings who reside in his home universe, he made a point of protecting his version of Earth. He's also conveniently enough the Watcher of Earth-616, the core version of the Marvel Universe. He's wrestled back Galactus, battled his own family member Aron the Rogue Watcher and generally helped ensure the survival of Earth. He was reprimanded repeatedly for these acts and even stripped of his title more than once. But he always went back to watching over the Earth - until his death at the hands of Nick Fury led to the events of <i>Original Sin</i>.</p>

      <h3>PUNISHMENT AGAINST THE GODS</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/uatu-2099-1.v1-1.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>

      <p>In Marvel's ongoing 2099 crossover, Uatu has apparently come back to life. However, the Watcher might have wanted to stay dead, given the hell he's experiencing now in <i>2099: Alpha</i>. Captured by Doctor Doom (who is revealed to have eliminated the superheroes of this reality before erasing any evidence of their existence from the memories and minds of humanity), Uatu has been forced into a massive machine that seems to be overloading his powers. His massive eyes are strained open and held in place by devices inserted into his eyelids. It's reminiscent of the device used in <i>Clockwork Orange</i>, used to force someone to keep their eyes open no matter what.</p>
      <p>Since he can never close his eyes, the Watcher is forced to look out upon the world and see all things and people. He begs with Doom to be freed, but Doom has too much use for him. Fearing that a new wave of superheroes might soon rise up, he orders the Watcher to try and find the people who will eventually become the most dangerous to the stability of a world that Doom secretly controls. Uatu can only impotently insult Doom, but lacks any way to free himself from Doom's control. However, even that can be hindered by the machines Doom has trapped him in, which allow the Latverian to electrocute Uatu at any point.</p>
      <p>It's a particularly harsh fate for Uatu, who has come to the protection of Earth multiple times over the years. In the end, he becomes just a tool for a mad man, Even if the other Watchers could find out what was happening to him, it's unlikely they could do anything because of their own oath of non-interference. Freeing Uatu and taking away Doom's ability to see the future might be the first step the heroes have to take if they want any chance of stopping Doctor Doom and his machinations.</p>
