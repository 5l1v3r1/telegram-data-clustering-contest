        <b>A new song from Ashutosh Gowariker's Panipat titled Mann Mein Shiva is out now. Featuring Arjun Kapoor and Kriti Sanon, it is a victory song that has the members of the royal families celebrating with their Praja</b>

      <p>Arjun Kapoor as Sadashivrao Bhau and Kriti Sanon as Parvati Bai are bringing forth the great story of Battle of Panipat helmed by ace filmmaker Ashutosh Gowariker. The film has many supporting characters and a new song titled Mann Mein Shiva is out now.  Titled Mann Mein Shiva, it features Arjun Kapoor and Kriti Sanon enjoying their victory with their family members as well as the Praja. While the music of this song is good, we are pretty impressed with Kriti and Arjun's dancing skills.</p>
      <p>The song that appears to be a victory song is sung by Kunal Ganjawala, Deepanshi Nagar and Padmanabh Gaikwad. The music has been given by Ajay Atul and the lyrics have been written by Javed Akhtar. Arjun Kapoor and Kriti Sanon who are husband and wife in the film are celebrating their victory as well as motivating their Praja - villagers by dancing with them. We love the choreography which is quite simple yet powerful. Arjun and Kriti's chemistry too appears to be pretty impressive. It slightly reminds us of  Ranveer Singh's Malhari from Bajirao Mastani, however, there is a great difference in the tempo of the songs. Watch the song below:</p>

      <p>Panipat narrates the story of the great Battle Of Panipat which was fought between the Marathas and Ahmad Shah Abdali - the king of Afghanistan who wanted to conquer Delhi and subsequently the whole of India. Sadashivrao Bhau played a vital role in forming the army and charging at Abdali. Sanjay Dutt essays the role of Ahmad Shah Abdali in this period-drama directed by Ashutosh Gowariker. Panipat also stars Mohnish Bahl as Nana Saheb Peshwa, Padmini Kolhapure as Gopika Bai, Zeenat Aman as Sakina Begum, Sahil Salathia as Shamsher Bahadur and many more. </p>
