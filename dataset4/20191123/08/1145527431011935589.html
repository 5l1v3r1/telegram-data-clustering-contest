        <b>Maharashtra government formation: On Saturday, BJP's Devendra Fadnavis took oath as the Maharashtra Chief Minister for a second term at Raj Bhavan on Saturday</b>
      </p>
      <p>Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has described the current political situation in Maharashtra asÂ  "snollygoster"</p>
      <p>Tharoor, on Saturday, re- posted the meaning of "Snollygoster" by saying, "Correction: Most recent use: 23 November 2019, Mumbai".</p>
      <p>Tharoor had defined snollygoster two years back and had said, "a shrewd, unprincipled politician".</p>
