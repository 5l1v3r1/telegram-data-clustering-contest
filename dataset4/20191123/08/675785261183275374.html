      <h1>Truth behind Jose Mourinho's 'defensive' mindset ahead of Tottenham return</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho was sacked as Man Utd manager last December with a reputation of being a defensive coach, but that might have been unfair as he embarks on the Tottenham job</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">David Dubas-Fisher, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-dubas-fisher/</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has developed a reputation of being a defensive minded coach, but his sides have consistently been the top scorers in the division.</p>
      <p>Mourinho’s time at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> saw him being taunted with “park the bus” chants from opposition supporters.</p>
      <p>The new Spurs manager had earned something of a reputation for being a defensive minded coach.</p>
      <p>However, a look through his record as a manager shows that his sides have consistently been the top scorers in the division.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has had 14 completed seasons (ones where he wasn’t sacked) since taking over Porto in 2002.</p>
      <p>His team were the top scorers in six of those league campaigns and the second top scorers in five of them.</p>

      <p>That leaves just three seasons where his team weren’t one of the two top attacking sides in the division - two of which were at United.</p>
      <p>The first time Mourinho failed to make the top two was on his return to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> in 2013/14.</p>
      <p>His side finished third top scorers that year with 71 goals, only one fewer than when they finished top scorers in 2005/06.</p>

      <p>The second time was with Manchester United in 2016/17.</p>
      <p>His side scored just 54 times that year making them only the eighth highest scorers in the division.</p>
      <p>They scored 68 the following year, which was the fifth highest total in the division.</p>
      <p>He returns to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> looking to bolster a side with a wealth of attacking talent including Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Heung-min Son and Christian Eriksen which has only managed 18 goals in 12 Premier League games so far this term.</p>
