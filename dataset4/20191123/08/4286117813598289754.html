          <b>India vs Bangladesh, Pink Ball Test Day 2: Live Score</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Playing only his 8th Test match in 2019, Virat Kohli got the hundred and put India in a commanding position in the 2nd Test in Kolkata. Virat Kohli got to his hundred in 159 balls and had hit 12 boundaries in a well-paced innings at the Eden Gardens.</p>
      <p>Virat Kohli got off the mark with a thick outside edge after he walked in to bat with Indian scoreboard reading 43/2. Initially, the India captain found it difficult to score runs with the pink ball making things tough for the batsmen but he soon found his rhythm and entertained the jam-packed crowd at the Eden Gardens with some exquisite shots. Virat Kohli brought out his repertoire of classic shots as fans cheered him on.</p>
      <p>En route to his 27th Test hundred, Kohli became the fastest to reach 5000 runs in Test cricket as captain and only the sixth overall to achieve the feat. Kohli is also the only Indian to breach the 5000-run mark as captain.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Ishant Sharma and his pace colleagues wreaked havoc with the pink ball to skittle out Bangladesh for 106 runs on the opening day of the ongoing day-night Test at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata.</p>
      <p>Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli then smashed fifties as India, 1-0 up heading into the second and final match of the two-test series, finished day one on 174-3.</p>
      <p>Kohli (59 not out) and his deputy Ajinkya Rahane (23 not out) returned to bat on Day 2 and continued to dominate the proceedings and put the game beyond the reach of an injury-hit Bangladesh.</p>
