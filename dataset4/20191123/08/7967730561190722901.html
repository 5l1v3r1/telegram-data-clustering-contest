      <p>Irish Queenslander Noel Greenhalgh has won his share of group 1s in his lime silks with the dark green shamrock, but Mister Sea Wolf’s victory in the inaugural $1 million The Gong was something special.</p>
      <p>It had a lot to do with where the horse had come from.</p>
      <p>“We had been looking for an Irish horse for a long time and this bloke was the first one we bought,” Greenhalgh said. “Guy [Mulcaster] found him, and to get over here was great and he has been a gem of a horse for us.</p>

      <p>“He tries so hard every time, and for him to win that race is probably as good as a group 1 for me.”</p>
      <p>Greenhalgh had one regret about Mister Sea Wolf, which surprisingly got out to $21 by jump time.</p>
      <p>“I took a lot of $8 on Thursday and wasn’t smart enough to take the 20s today,” he said. “It doesn’t matter, this is just great.”</p>
      <p>The Chris Waller-trained eight-year-old made it 11 wins as as he got the better of Quackerjack ($6.50), which was brave after sitting three-wide outside the lead, to win by head with stablemate Star Of The Seas ($7) a neck back in third. They broke the 10-year-old track record for the Kembla 1600m.</p>
      <p>The win gave James McDonald the double in Racing NSW's new $1 million races after his win on Savatiano in The Hunter last week.</p>
      <p>“It’s great to win the first running of The Gong. The atmosphere is incredible,” McDonald said.</p>
      <p>“Like I said last week after winning The Hunter, the spring just keeps rolling on. It is fantastic</p>
      <p>“He’s my old favourite. We’ve had a good association</p>
      <p>“I thought he was going to be up against it with 59kg and a firm track.”</p>
      <p>While McDonald celebrated, Rachel King on Quackerjack was left wondering what would have happened if he had drawn a gate. From the outside barrier he was posted three-wide throughout.</p>
      <p>“He got into that really good rhythm of his and gee he is tough. When [Mister Sea Wolf] got up to him he was deadset going to run straight past us but [Quackerjack] just wouldn’t let him,” King said. "He has the biggest heart.</p>
      <p>“He deserved to win more than anything. It was just the barrier that beat him. If draws even half decent he is one off and wins.”</p>
      <p>Quackerjack will back up into the Villiers Stakes, and trainer Mark Newnham keen to get his miler into the Doncaster.</p>
      <p>“We had the toughest run in the race and we have been beaten a head,” Newnham said.</p>
      <p>“I said to someone at the 600m we’re done, but what a tough miler he is. He was three-deep with no cover all the way and was still there at the end.</p>
      <p>“He is going to win a nice race and we will go to the Villiers and hope he can draw a barrier.”</p>
      <p>Glen Boss broken the whip rules on third placegetter Star Of The Seas, hitting her 10 times before the 100m mark and 13 times in consecutive strides.</p>
      <p>He apologised to stewards and pleaded guilty and was suspended for two weeks and fined $4000 for his efforts.</p>
      <p>"Every time I hit it, it was responding. I got carried away because thought I was going to win the race," Boss said.</p>
