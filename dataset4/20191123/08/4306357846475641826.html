      <h3>Dimitar Berbatov is backing Manchester City to ease to a 3-2 victory over Chelsea FC at The Etihad on Saturday evening.</h3>
      <p>The defending Premier League champions will be eager to return to winning ways following a 3-1 loss to Liverpool FC last time out.</p>
      <p>The Citizens dropped down to fourth place in the Premier League table and nine points adrift of Liverpool FC after their third defeat of the season.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC are a point ahead of Manchester City following a run of six successive Premier League victories under Frank Lampard.</p>
      <p>But Manchester City can hoist themselves above Chelsea FC if Pep Guardiola’s side manage to beat their London rivals.</p>
      <p>Former Spurs striker Berbatov is confident that Manchester City will bounce back against Chelsea FC on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>“City need to bounce back, they are now nine points behind Liverpool and if they lose this one, Chelsea will become title contenders,” Berbatov told <i>Betfair</i>.</p>
      <p>“Frank Lampard’s side are on a great run and they can cause City problems. But saying that, Guardiola will prepare his team to the maximum and they can’t afford any more slip ups whilst Liverpool are flying. They need the win and I think they will get it at the Etihad.”</p>
      <p>Manchester City have won five of the past six meetings against Chelsea FC in all competitions, keeping five clean sheets in the process.</p>
      <p>The Citizens were 6-0 winners against Chelsea FC in their last meeting at The Etihad under Maurizio Sarri.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC are looking to win eight consecutive away games in all competitions for the first time in the west London side’s history.</p>
      <p>However, the Blues don’t have a great record at The Etihad after losing three of their last four trips to Manchester City.</p>
