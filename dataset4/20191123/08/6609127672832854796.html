      </p>

      <p>In a candid Instagram post the actress, who is best known for playing Sophie Webster on the ITV soap, revealed she was staying in her PJs instead of going out with boyfriend Kean Bryan.</p>
      <p>She told her followers:  “Tonight I was supposed to look completely different, I was supposed to be dressed up, hair and make up done ready to eat some nice food and maybe have my first cocktail in 11 months with Kean, our first time away from Mexx for an hour or two, instead I look like this.</p>
      <p>“I look like this because I naively thought that four weeks after my baby I would be in all my old clothes looking exactly like I did before I got pregnant.</p>
      <p>“I thought my jeans would instantly fit and I would just be my “old self” only with my new beautiful baby. How wrong I was, I tried 23 outfits on at least, nothing looked right, nothing looked like me and I felt like I was looking at a completely different person, I suppose to a certain extent I now am, I am Mexx’s mum.</p>

      <p>“I sat and cried and felt ashamed that I haven’t just been able to pick up where I left off like people seem to do here on Instagram!”</p>
      <p>She went on to reveal that she was sharing her feelings because she wanted people to know it was OK not “act or feel a certain way” after giving birth.</p>
      <p>“So this was so important for me to say, for all the women who think they should look, act or feel a certain way after a baby DONT! Don’t beat yourself up,” she told her followers.</p>
      <p>“If four, six, eight weeks or even a year after giving birth you don’t fit in your old clothes don’t worry, you can always join my club. It’s important to be honest because being a new mummy is daunting enough!”</p>

      <p>Brooke added: “The most important thing is me and Mexx are healthy and happy and as soon as my baby boy looked at me, I realised he doesn’t care if I fit in my old jeans or not .. So I guess creased watermelon PJs &amp; slippers for now it is #bekindtoyourself #newmumclub.”</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly Brooke was inundated with support from her fans  and famous friends.</p>
      <p>Charley Webb told her: “You’re a beauty inside and out.”</p>
      <p>While Casey Batchelor, who is currently pregnant with her second child, remarked: “Oh I hear you. I was like this after my first and I’ll be exactly the same in two months time when I’ve got my 2nd. Mummy hood is so daunting let’s be kind to ourselves . Well said @brookelevivincent.  You are doing amazing.”</p>
      <p>And Lucy Fallon added: “You’re my fave. And you’re A MEGA BABE. And we all love you. And mexx.”</p>
