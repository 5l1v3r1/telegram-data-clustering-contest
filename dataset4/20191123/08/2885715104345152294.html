      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:54:27+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/jagpreet-singh-sandhu/" target="_blank">Jagpreet Singh Sandhu</a></address>
      <p>A couple, residents of Burail, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a>, have filed a damage suit of Rs 1 crore at the district Court of Chandigarh, for the death of their minor son alleging negligence by Chandigarh government hospital authorities and officials concerned with it.</p>
      <p>The suit has been filed in the Court of Meenakshi Gupta, Civil Judge (Junior Division), against Chief Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, New Delhi; Deputy Commissioner, Chandigarh; Municipal Commissioner, Chandigarh; Senior Medical Officer (SMO) Civil Hospital and Dispensary Sector 45, Chandigarh; Medical Superintendent, Government Multi Specialty Hospital (GMSH) Sector 16, Chandigarh; Director, Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) Sector 32, Chandigarh; Medical Superintendent GMCH Sector 32; Director PGIMER; Medical Superintendent PGIMER; Chairman Medical Council of India, Director Food and Supply department, Chandigarh; Advisor to the Administrator, Chandigarh, and Veer Singh, the accused in the FIR registered in the matter.</p>
      <p>The matter is scheduled for hearing on December 5, when the complainant Suneeta Devi (34) and her husband Suresh (49) will record their statements in court. The complainants have also moved an application to exempt them from the court fee of the case, since they are daily wage earners and cannot afford the amount. The court is expected to pronounce the order on the fee waiver application at the next hearing.</p>
      <p>As per the petitioners, on May 30, 2019, their son, Rohit, fell into a pan of hot oil of a street vendor namely Veer Singh, while playing outside their house, following which an FIR was registered against Veer Singh at the Sector 34 Police Station, Chandigarh. The petitioners have alleged that soon after hearing Rohit’s cries, his uncle, Pintu, had rushed him to the Sector 45 Civil hospital and dispensary, where the doctors refused to give him treatment and asked him to take the child to GMCH Sector 32. Pintu thus asked for ambulance from the dispensary staff to take them, which was provided on a payment of Rs 500 to the driver of ambulance.</p>
      <p>The petitioners further alleged that at GMCH 32, the doctors without giving any treatment, referred the child to PGIMER by giving a note of non availability of bed. Pintu was again forced to take the child to PGIMER in an auto rickshaw as no ambulance was provided. At PGIMER, the child was again refused treatment and was referred back to GMCH 32 without any immediate treatment.</p>
      <p>The petitioners stated that after somehow getting help from people they were then able to get a bed at GMCH 32, where the child was admitted. The treatment was finally initiated eight hours after the incident. The complainants, however, alleged that Rohit was not treated properly as he remained admitted till June 4, 2019, and when his condition worsened, he was again referred to PGIMER, where due to improper treatment, he succumbed to injuries on June 5.</p>
      <p>Advocates Sandeep Gupta and Jasbir Makkar, counsel for the petitioners argued that all the parties against whom the suit has been filed are contributory responsible for Rohit’s death, as all of them failed to comply with their duties and the child died due to negligence.<br/>The counsel added that the complainants decided to move court after not being paid the compensation.</p>
