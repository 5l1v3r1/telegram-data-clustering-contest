      <h1>English football's 10 current longest serving managers after Mauricio Pochettino axe</h1>
      <h2>The Tottenham Hotspur boss was sacked earlier this week and replaced by Jose Mourinho, as the Argentinean's reign as the fifth longest-serving boss in England came to a close</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino's sacking as Tottenham Hotspur manager wasn't just good news for Spurs incumbent Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Because the surprise Tuesday evening departure of the Argentinean also meant that English football's established managerial order was shaken up.</p>
      <p>Ex-Southampton manager Pochettino was sitting fifth in the list of durable bosses up and down the four divisions when the axe fell on him, with his five-and-half year stint at Spurs marking him out as the third longest-serving Premier League manager currently in a job.</p>
      <p>But his shock departure from North London meant an entry into the top five for Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp, just a few short months after he bested Pochettino to win the Champions League.</p>
