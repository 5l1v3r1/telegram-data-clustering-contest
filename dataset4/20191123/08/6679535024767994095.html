      <p>Pakistan Army on Saturday violated ceasefire by resorting to unprovoked firing and shelling on forward posts and villages along the Line of Control (LOC) in Jammu and Kashmir’s Rajouri district, a defence spokesman said.</p>
      <p>The Indian Army guarding the LoC retaliated to silence the Pakistani guns and the cross-border firing between the two sides in Sunderbani sector was going on when last reports were received, he said.</p>
      <p>“Pakistan initiated the unprovoked ceasefire violation by firing of small arms and shelling with mortars at about 11.30 a.m., prompting befitting retaliation by Indian Army,” the spokesman said.</p>
      <p>He said there was no report of any casualty in the Pakistani shelling.</p>
