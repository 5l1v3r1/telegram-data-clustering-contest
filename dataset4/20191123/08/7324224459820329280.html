      <p>Parts of Britain could see two inches of rain on Saturday, less than a fortnight after parts of the Midlands and north of England were soaked by floods.</p>
      <p>Yellow weather warnings are in force across the country throughout the day after the rain started to fall in the South West overnight, moving north towards Scotland throughout the day.</p>
      <p>In the East Midlands and North East the Met Office is warning that flooding is likely until midnight, as people continue the clean-up from the deluge earlier this month.</p>

      <p>Wales, central and south-eastern England will escape the worst of the showers.</p>
      <p>Met Office forecaster Greg Dewhurst said: “It’s a pretty unsettled start to the weekend, and a very cloudy day today, with heavy rain pushing its way north throughout the day.”</p>
      <p>Nine flood warnings are in place throughout England on Saturday, mainly in the South West and North East, alongside 85 less severe flood alerts.</p>
      <p>Firefighters in Devon and Cornwall warned drivers to stay away from flooded roads after a number of calls overnight to stranded cars.</p>

      <p>Photographs showed flash flooding in areas such as Clyst St Mary in Exeter.</p>
      <p>Mr Dewhurst said other rainy areas could also see problems.</p>
      <p>He added: “Some places could see 40mm to 50 mm of rain. There’s quite a bit of rainfall to come in the next 24 hours.”</p>
      <p>The wet weather will subside on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Two yellow weather warnings are in place for the east and north of Scotland until 9am on Sunday, but for most, the rain will have cleared.</p>
      <p>Mr Dewhurst said: “On Sunday the rain will ease away. It’s looking like a much brighter day for many.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the Army was called in to assist stricken communities after towns and villages around Doncaster and Sheffield and parts of the Midlands were drenched by heavy downpours.</p>
      <p>Doncaster Council said 970 homes and businesses in the town were affected by the rain between November 7 and 15.</p>
