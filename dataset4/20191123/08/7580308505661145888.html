      <p>The Lagos House of Assembly on Friday granted approval for Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu to access a loan of N250 billion for capital projects in the state.</p>
      <p>The approval followed the report submitted by the Chairman, Committee on Finance, Mr Rotimi Olowo, which recommended the N100 billion bond loan and N150 billion syndicated loan.</p>
      <p>Speaker of the House, Mr Mudashiru Obasa, noted that the approval for the loan was granted to bridge the huge infrastructural gap in the state.</p>
      <p>Obasa, therefore, directed the Clerk of the House, Mr Azeez Sani to communicate the approval to the governor.</p>
