      </p>
      <p>Early estimates hinted at the film performing poorer than the Hollywood release ‘Frozen 2’, but lucky for the team, the film showed some grown towards the end of the day. However, according to trade experts, the film has a lot riding on its collections over the weekend. With stiff competition coming in from new and old Hollywood and Bollywood releases, ‘Pagalpanti’ collections will have to double in order to sail though.</p>
      <p>The film reportedly earned around Rs 1.60 crore in Mumbai and approximately Rs 1.15 crore nett in the Delhi / UP circuit and Rs 49 lakh in East Punjab. The collections in Rajasthan, CP Berar were also low with none of the circuits registering collections over Rs 30 lakh.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the movie, Arshad Warsi said in a statement, "<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Pagalpanti">Pagalpanti</a> was a very good experience. There are a couple of reasons. First of all, he (Anees Bazmee) is a very good director. He writes from his head and is very easy to work with. Secondly, there is a nice bunch of co-stars, easygoing and with no ego complexes, which makes it easier. They are all good actors and good people. It was my first time with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anees-Bazmee">Anees Bazmee</a>, so I was a little apprehensive about how it would be to work with him. But he gave me full freedom. I like to improvise a little and I got the freedom to do that."</p>
      <p>All thanks to this creative freedom, critics have been going gaga over Arshad’s comic timing in the film. The actor is being credited for giving some of the best punchlines in the film and for reinventing the notion of the funny sidekick once again.</p>
      <p>The film is facing stiff competition from the Hollywood animated film ‘Frozen 2’, that also got a Hindi dubbed version with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Priyanka-Chopra">Priyanka Chopra</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Parineeti-Chopra">Parineeti Chopra</a> voicing the lead characters.</p>
