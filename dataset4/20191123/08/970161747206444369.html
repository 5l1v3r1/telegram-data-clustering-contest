      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/girls-aloud/">Girls Aloud</a> members <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/cheryl-fernandez-versini/">Chery</a>l, Kimberley Walsh and Nicola Roberts have denied claims they’re voting for former bandmate <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a> to take on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here</a>’s Bush Tucker trials.</p>
      <p>Nadine is just one of several high-profile names in the Australian jungle this year, including reality TV icon <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> and EastEnders actress Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
      <p>Speaking on claims that she could be voting for the 34-year-old to take part in the trials in revenge for their long-touted feud, Cheryl insisted that it was all love (machine).</p>
      <p>‘We only want to see Nadine do well, and regardless of any differences we might have had, we will always all have love for each other,’ she said.</p>
      <p>‘We did not enjoy watching her distressed when jumping out of the plane. And we don’t have time for group chats regarding the trials on the show!’</p>

      <p>Kimberley also refuted the rumours, insisting that she is watching the show, and her heart goes out to the Insatiable singer.</p>

      <p>‘I felt really emotional watching Nadine jump out of the plane and texted Cheryl saying how hard it was to watch. I think she’s doing great in there,’ she said.</p>
      <p>Speaking about social media-fuelled rumours that the trio have a group chat dedicated to Nadine’s stint on the show, Nicola added to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7716349/Cheryl-Kimberley-Walsh-Nicola-Roberts-SLAM-claims-group-chat-slating-Nadine-Coyle.html">MailOnline</a>:’We don’t have a group chat about I’m A Celebrity.</p>
      <p>‘This just isn’t true. We only wish Nadine the best in the jungle and hope she does well on the show.’</p>
      <p>As members of Girls Aloud alongside Sarah Harding, the girls scored 20 consecutive top 10 hits on the UK chart, a record for a UK act. They formed in 2002 on Pop Stars: The Rivals before splitting for good after their tenth anniversary tour.</p>
      <p>We previously <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-a-celebrity-all-the-girls-aloud-drama-as-nadine-coyle-rubbishes-cheryl-feud-rumours-as-fake-news-11193321/">started our very own deep-dive into the fractured history between Nadine and Cheryl</a> and their apparent, long-standing feud.</p>
      <p>The Northern Irish singer has already rubbished claims that she and Cheryl don’t get on, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/im-celebritys-jacqueline-jossa-grills-nadine-coyle-girls-aloud-beef-cheryl-brands-fake-news-11191860/">telling campmates in the jungle that the rumours were ‘fake news.’</a></p>
      <p>And even though a Girls Aloud reunion isn’t looking possible at the moment, a new itineration of the girlband may have already been born as Nadine<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-a-celebritys-nadine-coyle-teaches-caitlyn-jenner-girls-aloud-dance-moves-and-its-pure-comedy-gold-11197437/"> taught some of her campmates the dance routine</a> to the band’s last number one single, The Promise.</p>
