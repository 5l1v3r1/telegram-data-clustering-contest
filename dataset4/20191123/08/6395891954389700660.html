      <p>Dippin' Dots human resources official Steve Heisner told <a href="https://www.wpsdlocal6.com/news/explosion-reported-at-dippin-dots-production-facility/article_e80e7a02-0d9d-11ea-941f-17128140dbcb.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook_WPSD-TV">WPSD</a> initial reports of only two injuries immediately following the blast have been revised to confirm four injuries, but the extent of the injuries remains unknown.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, City of Paducah Spokeswoman Pam Spencer <a href="https://www.wpsdlocal6.com/news/explosion-reported-at-dippin-dots-production-facility/article_e80e7a02-0d9d-11ea-941f-17128140dbcb.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook_WPSD-TV">told the news station </a>in a statement that in addition to the explosion, a nitrogen leak was detected inside the plant, but it was not immediately clear if the leak caused the explosion or was a result of it.</p>
      <p>Liquid nitrogen is used to freeze Dippin' Dots ice cream.</p>
      <p>Heisner also <a href="https://www.wpsdlocal6.com/news/explosion-reported-at-dippin-dots-production-facility/article_e80e7a02-0d9d-11ea-941f-17128140dbcb.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook_WPSD-TV">told WPSD</a> the extent of the damage to the facility is not yet known and employees were not allowed to re-enter the plant because the power was shut off and oxygen levels were too low.</p>
      <p>“We do not yet know what the cause of that explosion was,” Heisner told <a href="https://www.kfvs12.com/2019/11/23/explosion-dippin-dots-mccracken-county-ky/">KFVS</a>, adding, “We will soon be able to get inside safely, and make an assessment of what has occurred. The building is all intact. There was an isolated explosion, for lack of a better term.” </p>
      <p>“We have very few employees that work the night shift. All employees have been accounted for,” Heisner <a href="https://www.kfvs12.com/2019/11/23/explosion-dippin-dots-mccracken-county-ky/">told the news station</a>.<br/> </p>
