      <h3>Captain Steven Taylor pulled off heroic touches at both ends of the park as Wellington Phoenix bagged their first win of the A-League season, 2-1 over Brisbane Roar.</h3>
      <p>Coming off their worst start to any campaign, with a solitary draw through five games, relief was delivered to new coach Ufuk Talay in Wellington on Saturday through goals in each half to classy offshore signings Taylor and Ulises Davila.</p>

      <p>Their sharp finishes decidedan even, bruising contest, with Brisbane slipping back to the inaccurate ways in front of goal that hampered them before lastweek’s thrilling 4-3 upset of Melbourne City.</p>
      <p>Wellington fielded the same XI that drew with Melbourne Victory two weeks ago while the visitors’ lone change was the introduction ofleft winger Jordan Courtney-Perkins, making him the youngest starting player in Roar history. The 17-year-old Brisbane academyproduct enjoyed a solid outing but was guilty of squandering his team’s best chance during a crucial early period. Taylorhad put his team in front with a dominant header from Davila’s cross in the 10th minute, rising above a flat-footed Roar defence.</p>

      <p>Minutes later the former Newcastle United centre back denied Courtney-Perkins with an instinctive goal-line clearance afterthe teenager smashed a close range volley.</p>
      <p>Brisbane looked the sharper outfit in the first half but fell away in the second spell after coach Robbie Fowler surprisinglyremoved impressive Welsh forward Aaron Amadi-Holloway at the break.</p>
      <p>Lively Mexican Davila rifled home a left-footed drive from the top of the box for his fourth goal of the season and he lookedlike adding more as Wellington finished the stronger.</p>
      <p>However, Stefan Mauk set Phoenix pulses racing with an 85th-minute goal against the run of play, steering home Brad Inman’sassist.</p>
      <p>It was the third loss for Fowler’s men while Wellington’s three points lifts them off the bottom of the ladder, although they’ll be back there if Central Coast secure a point onSunday against Western United.</p>
