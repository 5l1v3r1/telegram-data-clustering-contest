      <h1>Ghana’s Arts, Culture and Sports is under spiritual curse – Shatta wale</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:15:46+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/staff/" target="_blank">Nana Yaw</a></address>
      <p>Ghanaian dancehall artiste, Shatta Wale has thrown his weight behind Patapaa after the latter <a href="https://www.ghbase.com/deadly-spirits-are-controlling-the-entertainment-industry-patapaa/">made a claim that the music industry is controlled by evil spirits.</a></p>
      <p>Sharing his near-death experience on Okay FM, Patapaa noted that artists in the industry need to be watchful because there are spirits that run the affairs of the industry who are bent on causing havoc to them.</p>
      <p>It seems Shatta Wale has also come to the realisation that the industry is cursed as he has also made the same claim in a post on Facebook.</p>
      <p>As to why he made that claim, Shatta Wale didn’t give details to it but we are sure an inner experience is what has prompted him to come out with such claim.</p>
      <p><i><b>“I’ve realized that after a massive brainstorming with a colleague we have come to a conclusion that Ghana arts, culture and sports is under spiritual curse…,”</b></i> he wrote on Facebook.</p>

      <p>Is his claim coming on the back of the Black Meteor’s unimpressive penalty shootout in the 3rd/4th place match in the just ended U23 AFCON?</p>
      <p>South Africa beat the Black Meteors to end their dream of booking a ticket to Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games after winning on penalties.</p>
      <p>The young Bafana Bafana edge past Ghana 6-5 on penalties after 2-2 scoreline in regulation time to win the third-place match at the Cairo International Stadium.</p>
      <p>The sad aspect is that this was their second penalty knockout defeat in one week.</p>
      <p>Or Shatta’s claim is about the culture and arts industry which seems to be stagnant over the years.?</p>
