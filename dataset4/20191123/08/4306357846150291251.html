      <h3>Harry Redknapp is confident that Liverpool FC can maintain their lead at the top of the Premier League table by easing to victory over Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon.</h3>
      <p>The Reds laid down a big marker in the Premier League title race last time out thanks to a 3-1 victory over defending champions Manchester City at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC are eight points ahead of Leicester City and Chelsea FC in the race to secure a first Premier League title after finishing as runners-up on four previous occasions.</p>
      <p>The Merseyside outfit have won 11 of their 12 games in the Premier League so far this season, only dropping points in a 1-1 draw with Manchester United at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Crystal Palace are winless in their last four Premier League games, including a 2-0 defeat by Chelsea FC at Stamford Bridge last time out.</p>
      <p>Former Spurs manager Redknapp is backing Liverpool FC to secure a straightforward win against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>“Liverpool have put themselves firmly in the driving seat to secure the title after a fabulous 3-1 victory over last season’s champions Manchester City at Anfield during their last outing,” Owen told <i>BetVictor</i>.</p>
      <p>“A nine-point cushion looks extremely useful and with eleven wins from twelve, it will need a big collapse from the Reds, despite two thirds of their campaign remaining.</p>
      <p>“Their title credentials will be tested on the road in London this Saturday when they visit Crystal Palace despite the Eagles only accumulating one point from a possible last twelve. They have endured a tough fixture list which gets no easier here but a welcome break may well have the hosts recharged.</p>
      <p>“Like any team on a long unbeaten run, the pressure can mount to sustain it, but Liverpool can utilise their deep squad to maintain the gap at the summit. They may have to be patient but have finished well, nicking late winners in many games recently and three more points look assured in the capital.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC haven’t won the Premier League title but have finished in their second place in 2002, 2009, 2014 and 2018.</p>
      <p>The Reds ended up a point adrift of defending Premier League champions Manchester City last season despite losing just one game.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC have already beaten Arsenal, Chelsea FC, Manchester City and Spurs this term.</p>
