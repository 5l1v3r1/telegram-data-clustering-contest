      <h1>Mohsin Abbas Haider set for a comeback and celebrities are cheering him on</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:37:46+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>An FIR was lodged against actor, singer and writer, Mohsin Abbas Haider by his former wife in July, 2019, accusing him of domestic abuse. Although Fatima Sohail uploaded pictures of her bruises to justify her claim, Mohsin denied all allegations saying, “she is trying to play the woman card.” Adding that, “It is true I had anger issues in the past but I’m a changed man.”</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, over a month after the Lahore Family Court accepted Fatima’s request for <i>khula </i>on September 26, 2019, Mohsin uploaded a picture of his musical comeback.</p>
      <p>Posted on his Instagram, the picture titled <i>Rooh</i> addressed his upcoming single, featuring music by Faraz Khosa. The actor had shared the first look of the cover art captioned with hashtag #ComingSoon.</p>

      <p>As surprising as that alone may sound, his post was followed by a number of videos of celebrities promoting his upcoming song, attached in a collage with the cover art.</p>

      <p>The first video showed veteran actor Naumaan Ijaz, wishing Mohsin the best for his upcoming single, adding that he is like a younger brother. He also said that both individuals who have worked on the song put their soul into their work, just like the title <i>Rooh</i> suggests.</p>
