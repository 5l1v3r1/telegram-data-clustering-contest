      <p>James Corden looks incredible as he showed off his slimmed-down figure.</p>
      <p>The TV host, 41, looked his best when he filmed new scenes for a laugh-out-loud parody of Frozen 2 for The Late Late Show in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Gavin &amp; Stacey's James divulged he had lost more than one stone since the start of this year.</p>
      <p>And the results were amazing as he looked handsome while dressed as the Disney character Elsa for the epic TV scenes set to air.</p>
      <p>It comes after James previously touched on his weight struggles while he shared his determination to get into shape.</p>
      <p>In June, the funnyman slimmed down to a trim 16st 7lbs from more than 17st earlier this year.</p>

      <p>He told <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/james-corden-weight-loss-craving-17215059">The Daily Star</a> : “I think the lightest I have been is 212 pounds (just over 15st), something like that. Right now I’m like 234lb (16st 7lb).</p>
      <p>“I am not tall enough to be 234lb. And then my biggest I think I was like 280 and I have been also, even this year, I’ve been 250 (more than 17st)."</p>

      <p>He added: "Bread is the absolute destroyer of me and it’s everywhere. You can’t move for it. It’s everywhere. I’d do anything to [stop].”</p>
      <p>More recently in September, James hit out at Bill Maher for wanting to bring back "fat-shaming" as he said the TV host was encouraging bullying.</p>
      <p>Maher, 63, caused a stir with his controversial view fat-shaming needed to make a "comeback" which riled up the comedian.</p>

      <p>He said: "Fat-shaming doesn't need to end, it needs to make a comeback."</p>
      <p>James had a witty response for Maher as he reminded him fat-shaming hadn't gone away.</p>
      <p>He explained: "We're not all as lucky as Bill Maher, we don't all have a sense of superiority that burns 35,000 calories a day.</p>
      <p>"It's proven that fat-shaming only does one thing - it makes people feel ashamed. And shame leads to depression, anxiety and self-destructive behaviour. Self-destructive behaviour like over-eating.</p>
      <p>"Fat-shaming is just bullying and bullying only makes the problem worse."</p>
