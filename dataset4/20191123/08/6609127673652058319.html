      <p>Nearly two-thirds of British households have fallen in love with Aldi and Lidl, with families heading to the stores at least once every 12 weeks, according to research firm Kantar Worldpanel.</p>
      <p>"Turns out going to Aldi at 8am is not only quiet, but a bargain fest too," she recently explained on Facebook page LatestDeals .</p>
      <p>An Aldi told M.E.N. : "All items are reduced to 50% of the recommend sales price before stores open on their best before or use by dates."</p>
      <p>And that's not the only money saving method, shoppers can also get ahead of Specialbuy deals by downloading the Aldi app (on the Google Play or App Store ) and opting for notifications for when Specialbuys go live so you don't forget or miss out.</p>
      <p>The items themselves launch every Thursday morning at 8am, and every Sunday morning at 10am.</p>
      <p>They're sold on a first-come, first-served basis so you'll need to be one of the first through the doors to pick up the discounted item.</p>
      <p>And if anything does get leftover, there's a chance certain Specialbuys will be discounted every four to six weeks depending on store size and stock remaining.</p>
