      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> is confident that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> will go ‘massively wrong’ under <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a>, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Mourinho replaced Pochettino as Tottenham manager earlier this week after the Argentine was surprisingly sacked by the club’s chairman Daniel Levy.</p>
      <p>Pochettino departed Tottenham less than six months after guiding the club to the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/champions-league/">Champions League</a> final but it was his side’s domestic form which Levy cited as one of the key factors behind his decision to change managers.</p>
      <p>Under Pochettino, Spurs have registered just 25 points from their last 24 Premier League games and has left the club 14th in the table, 11 points behind fourth-placed Manchester City.</p>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/mauricio-pochettino-rejected-request-resign-tottenham-sacking-11185844/">Pochettino had turned down Levy’s request to step down during talks last week</a> and according to <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/tottenham-hotspur/story/3994589/how-mourinho-replaced-pochettino-inside-tottenhams-turbulent-day">ESPN</a>, the Argentine felt that walking away from the club would hinder his chances of getting a job with one of Europe’s elite teams.</p>

      <p>And the report also claims that Pochettino is ‘confident’ that Spurs will continue to go ‘massively wrong’ during Mourinho’s reign.</p>
      <p>Mourinho, meanwhile, is confident that Spurs can be title challengers next season.</p>
      <p>‘We cannot win the Premier League this season,’ Mourinho said this week. ‘We can, I’m not saying we will do, we can win it next season.’</p>
      <p>Mourinho is also adamant that the club will not sell Harry Kane, despite the striker reportedly becoming frustrated over a lack of trophies during his time at Spurs.</p>
      <p>‘This is not about me. This is about Mr Levy, this is about the club,’ Mourinho said.</p>
      <p>‘He has a vision, and part of that vision is to make the club better, bigger.</p>
      <p>‘There is no better and bigger football club without a bigger and better football team.</p>

      <p>‘So keeping the best players is obviously part of that plan. So it’s nothing new with me.</p>
      <p>‘It was not like a promise to me, it was not like I said, ‘I only go if, I only go if’, there were no ‘ifs’.</p>
      <p>‘It was him [Levy], part of his explanation about his vision for the club. Without being specific about the players, he told me he does not sell players when the manager doesn’t want to sell.’</p>
