      <p>After scoring the opener with a bullet header, the Geordie great made an emphatic goal line clearance just five minutes later to maintain his side’s lead.</p>
      <p>After a mix up at the back for Wellington, Roar must have thought they’d scored when</p>
      <p>Jordan Courtney-Perkins picked up the ball with an open goal in sight.</p>
      <p>But a recovering Taylor made a last-ditch, goal line challenge to deny Brisbane an all-important equaliser.</p>
      <p>“It was a Roy of the Rovers moment,” Fox Football expert Mark Bosnich said during half time.</p>
      <p>“Scoring a goal and clearing one off the line!”</p>
