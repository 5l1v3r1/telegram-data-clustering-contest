      <p>A woman has shared her joy at ‘a random act of kindness’ after finding a note and cash in a new handbag she bought from Tesco.</p>
      <p>When Clare Smith, 42, bought the handbag from her Tesco Extra in Hucknall she was stunned to find someone had put a little gift in the inside pocket, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/hucknall-woman-finds-inspiring-note-3567206">Nottingham Post reports.</a></p>
      <p>Clare, who works as a private cleaner, picked out the handbag that was the only one of its style, and hidden right at the back, on November 21.</p>
      <p>Clare said: "I'd been looking for a new bag and not seen one I liked but this one stood out.</p>
      <p>"When I got it home, I was removing the packaging and putting my belongings in, and in a zipped pocket was an envelope.</p>

      <p>"Inside was the note and the money. It really shocked me."</p>
      <p>The note read, "all your dreams are possible, go for it, have faith in yourself," accompanied by a £5 note.</p>
      <p>Now Clare wants to use the money for a good cause to brighten up someone’s day rather than spend it herself.</p>

      <p>She added: ”It really wasn't the money that got me though, but more the note. I've got it pinned up now.</p>
      <p>"I'd love to know who it was - I've since been told similar things have happened before in Hucknall. It's such a nice thing to do.</p>
      <p>Hucknall Extra store manager Sam Johnson said: "This is a lovely gesture from someone spreading kindness and we’re really happy they brightened Clare’s day."</p>
