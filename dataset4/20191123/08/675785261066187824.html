      <h3>Latest news</h3>
      <p>Callum Smith claims he will blow fighting at Anfield and all his other dreams if he loses to John Ryder on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Smith makes the second defence of his WBA Super super-middleweight title against Ryder in Liverpool’s M&amp;S Bank Arena and the Kopite is in line to fight at his beloved Anfield if he wins.</p>
      <p>The unbeaten Smith also dreams of fighting Gennady Golovkin or Canelo Alvarez in Las Vegas and knows none of this will happen if he slips up against Ryder.</p>
      <p>“Listen I’m switched on,” he said. “The fights that have been mentioned with Canelo, Golovkin, the big unification fights, there’re still there providing I come through this fight.</p>
      <p>“But if I lose this fight, they disappear. It’s a must win for me and it’s one more step towards those fights.</p>
      <p>“I know if I slip up, Anfield is gone. I’m fully focused on this one and if I get this one out of the way, I’ll speak to Eddie Hearn and see if he can deliver me a big fight in 2020.</p>
      <p>“I’ve trained hard. I’ve worked hard to become a world champion and I don’t plan on losing it just yet.”</p>
