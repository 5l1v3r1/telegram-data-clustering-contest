      <p>Kwese TV presenter, Andrea Owusu, aka Efia Odo has somewhat confirmed the belief we all hold that there is a secret relationship she has with Shatta Wale.</p>
      <p>After years of evading the question as to whether she sleeps with the multiple award winning artist, the TV personality now says she’s even pregnant for the SM boss in a new post.</p>
      <p>Efia said she has missed her period and if that becomes concrete, then it simply means she’s pregnant with Shatta Wale’s child.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ghbase.com/efia-odo-finally-admits-she-sleeps-with-shatta-wale-but-not-the-way-we-think/">Even more recently, Efia Odo told Pulse Ghana in an interview she sleeps with Shatta Wale</a> in her mind and can’t deny the fact that she has a thing for him.</p>
      <p>She shared this:</p>
      <blockquote>I did not see my menses, I think I’m pregnant for Shatta Wale.</blockquote>
