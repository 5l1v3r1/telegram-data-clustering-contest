      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - The Kahuku Red Raiders (9-3) and St. Louis Crusaders (11-0) will add the newest chapter to one of prep football’s oldest rivalries next weekend, when the teams battle for the Open Division State title.</p>
      <p>Big Red advanced to the title game rallying from a 10-7 halftime deficit to defeat a gritty Campbell Sabers (6-6) team 21-19, in the Open Division semi-final.</p>
      <p>The Red Raiders leaned on workhorse running back Zealand Matagi who rushed for 133 yards and a a pair of touchdowns.</p>

      <p>The St. Louis Crusaders (11-0) extended their winning streak to 38 games with a 35-0 win over the Mililani Trojans (8-5).</p>
      <p>Crusaders quarterback Jayden De Laura led the way for the St. Louis offense throwing for a methodical 15-26 for 99 yards and a pair of touchdowns.</p>
      <p>Wide receiver Roman Wilson tallied nine catches for 74 yards and two scores as the St. Louis defense didn’t allow the Trojans to muster a point, as the Trojans netted just 106 total yards for the game.</p>
