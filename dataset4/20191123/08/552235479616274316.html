      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:18:10+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:18</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser N Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-n-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>A frantic search is on to trace a missing East Kilbride schoolboy.</p>
      <p>Aiden Lochrie, who is believed to have autism, left Duncanrig Secondary around 1.45pm on Friday afternoon and has not been seen since 2.45pm on Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>At that time he was seen leaving EK, East Kilbride, heading towards an underpass at Telford Road in the town.</p>
      <p>Family and friends of the 14-year-old have taken to social media in a desperate plea for information.</p>

      <p>Now Police Scotland have issued an appeal and are asking for anyone with any help to step forward.</p>
      <p>Inspector Mark McLachlan of East Kilbride Office said: “Aiden’s current whereabouts is unknown and our concern is growing due to his age and the passage of time as he has not been in contact with family.</p>
      <p>“I would appeal to anyone who may have seen Aiden to contact us. Any small piece of information could help us find them.”</p>
      <p>Aiden is described as white Scottish, 4ft 7in tall and of slim build, with short light brown hair, brown eyes and wears glasses.</p>
      <p>He was last seen wearing school uniform which is all black and a black puffer jacket with a small ‘McKenzie’ logo on the top left of the jacket.</p>
      <p>A desperate post for information online by a friend of the family said: “Guys, please share this.</p>
      <p>“Aiden is autistic and is scared of the dark. The more shares the better chance of finding him.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with any information about Aiden’s whereabouts is asked to call Police Scotland on 101.</p>
      <p>Information can also be left anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
