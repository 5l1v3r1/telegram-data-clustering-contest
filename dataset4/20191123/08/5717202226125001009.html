      <p>Peter Crouch has claimed that he will not be surprised to see Tottenham try re-sign Gareth Bale in January from Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>The left-footed attacker has been with Spanish giants Madrid since joining them from Spurs in 2013.</p>
      <p>He’s had some stunning individual moments and won plenty of silverware, but he’s not been the most popular character at the Bernabeu and has struggled for minutes this campaign due to injury.</p>
      <p>The Welshman has played just seven times across all competitions this season for Madrid, scoring two goals and supplying two assists in return,</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6501288-exclusive-jose-mourinho-offered-gareth-bale-deal-as-daniel-levy-backs-new-tottenham-boss?utm_source=RSS">According to 90min</a>, Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has told the club’s new manager Jose Mourinho that they will attempt to bring Bale back to North London if he wants him.</p>
      <p>The report explains that an initial loan would be more probable due to his major £350,000-a-week wages.</p>
      <p>Crouch, who previously played alongside Bale at Spurs, can picture his former teammate returning to work alongside Mourinho.</p>
      <p>“Gareth Bale’s popularity in Spain has taken another hit after he danced in front of a flag that read: ‘Wales, Golf, Madrid, in that order,’ following their qualification for next summer’s European Championship,” <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7715867/PETER-CROUCH-Watch-Jose-Mourinhos-got-glint-eye-again.html">Crouch wrote in the Daily Mail.</a></p>
      <p>“I don’t believe he did it intentionally but the repercussions are obvious. It is clear to everyone how unhappy he is at Real Madrid and it would not surprise me in the slightest if Tottenham tried to manufacture a deal to bring Bale home in January.</p>
      <p>“Coming back to the Premier League would be massive. He was happy at Tottenham. He could be happy there again.”</p>

        <b>TBR’s View:</b>
      </p>
      <p>All eyes will be on Spurs to see what kind of window they have in January following Mourinho’s arrival, but the capture of Bale would surely exceed any expectations.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old definitely still has the ability to make a serious impact if he returns to English football and he left Spurs a top-class player for Madrid.</p>
      <p>It’s in defensive areas where the team needs strengthening most, but it would be foolish to overlook bringing back former fan favourite Bale to give everyone a boost midway through the season.</p>
