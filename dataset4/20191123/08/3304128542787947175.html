      <p>Deputy President William Ruto has for the umpteenth time told off the Standard Newspaper for spreading malicious falsehoods.</p>
      <p>Appearing on the daily’s splash is a sensational headline “BBI Sets Up Ruto Clash With Uhuru and Raila”.</p>
      <p>The daily quotes the DP to have said, “Kenyans are not fools to just accept conmanship hidden in BBI, which they were using a political tool for 2022.”</p>
      <p>These utterances, the daily said were made during McDonald Mariga’s thanksgiving ceremony on Friday.</p>
      <p>But according to Ruto, he stated that the BBI report which will be handed over to President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga on Tuesday next week,  will be discussed because every suggestion is important in any democracy.</p>
      <p>“Usual Standard gutter FAKE news. Where did WsR utter such nonsense? Kenyans should look forward to a robust, truthful national conversation to chart a unified way forward. Meanwhile ignore Standard’s garbage,” Ruto wrote on Twitter.</p>

      <p>According to Yusuf Haji, chairperson BBI taskforce, the recommendations arrived at represent views from Kenyans in the 47 counties.</p>
      <p>“The Face of Kenya was captured with at least 7000 citizens from all ethnic groups, genders, cultural and religious practices and different social and economic sectors coming forward eager to tell of their experiences and solutions to our pressing national challenges, ” the statement reads in part.</p>
      <p>Two camps have emerged with the team allied to DP Ruto strongly opposing recommendations to expand the executive.</p>
      <p>Word has it that the team has recommended the creation of a powerful Prime Minister position and two deputies in a bid to end the chaos witnessed after every election in the country.</p>
      <p>DP Ruto has been quoted saying that he will not support recommendations to create positions for selfish leaders.</p>
