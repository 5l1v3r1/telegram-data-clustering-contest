      <p>Deaths related to measles have risen to 20 in the past week on the Pacific island of Samoa, the government has said, eight days after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/17/samoa-declares-state-of-emergency-over-deadly-measles-epidemic">declaring a state of emergency over the outbreak</a>.</p>
      <p>The island state of 200,000, located south of the equator and halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand, declared a measles epidemic late in October after the first deaths.</p>
      <p>Suspected cases of measles have more than doubled over the past week to 1,644, the government added on Friday. Children under five accounted for all but one of the deaths.</p>
      <p>Staff from the UN agency Unicef have delivered 110,500 doses of vaccines this week as they fanned out across <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/samoa">Samoa</a> to boost its mandatory immunisation effort, the agency said. It has also worked with governments of other tiny Pacific nations to run immunisation campaigns and develop preparedness plans to combat a regional outbreak, it added.</p>
      <p>Australia is sending a specialist team of doctors, nurses and public health experts to Samoa, along with equipment and supplies, the foreign ministry said.</p>
