        <b>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp made a subtle dig at the media at his Melwood news briefing on Friday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Reds boss hinted that his time in front of the media was one of the worst jobs for the German, as he continually tries to keep a lid on all title talk.</p>
      <p>Klopp’s men are a odds on to win their first domestic title since 1990 after surging eight points clear of their nearest challengers with 12 games gone in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>It prompted a question about the title race from <i>Sky Sports</i>‘ reporter: “Generally, you’re not a side that loses focus or gets complacent, so what do you feel now is the biggest threat to you in the title race.”</p>
      <p>Like transfers, it is not a subject Klopp likes to speak about and he was quick to let the media know about it.</p>
      <p>“We don’t think about the title race. The biggest challenge for us is constantly facing questions about it,” Klopp said.</p>

      <p>“After that it is (a) completely normal season. We never made it the season where we have to (win the league).</p>
      <p>“We play as good as we can, try to get as many points as we can and the challenges are the 26 games we have to play – and the next one is Crystal Palace, and maybe in a couple of minutes when we talk about that,” Klopp added smiling.</p>

      <p>“These challenges are big enough so we don’t need any others and we don’t think about anything else.”</p>
      <p>Klopp was also asked about the Joe Gomez, Raheem Sterling incident and <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/klopp-shocked-by-pochettino-axe-says-mourinho-was-desperate"><b>Jose Mourinho’s appointment at Tottenham.</b></a></p>
      <p>Facing the assembled media for the first time since the latest international break, he was alsoreminded of what a busy schedule Liverpool now face over the coming six weeks.</p>
      <p>With no fewer than 12 matches to navigate between now December 29, the German quipped with a subtle eye role that he will also have to attend as many press conferences.</p>
      <p>That of course, is part of the job, but despite his tongue-in-cheek grumblings, Klopp is clever and knows that the bigger challenge will be to keep his best players fit and firing and his whole squad happy as they attack silverware on five fronts.</p>
