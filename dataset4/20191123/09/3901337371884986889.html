      <p>Khama Billiat could play a big role for Kaizer Chiefs on Sunday afternoon when they battle Maritzburg United for a spot in the Telkom Knockout final, and he’s got a message for the fans.</p>

      <p>Billiat is yet to win any silverware since joining the Glamour Boys from Mamelodi Sundowns, and for a man who is used to accolades he will be eager to progress into the final and take on step closer to adding a new medal to his collection.</p>
      <p>Chiefs’ form has seen a big increase in the number of fans making the trip to the stadium to watch them play over the course of this season so far, and a big crowd is expected at Mbombela Stadium tomorrow when they go up against Maritzburg United.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Amakhosi faithful ahead of the tie, the attacker told Chiefs’ official website, “Our supporters add extra motivation for the team, and they have come out in big numbers to watch us which has been a big boost.</p>
      <p>“They have been missing this form from the team. The more we win, they will certainly stop watching the games at home and come to the stadium. We have a good connection with the fans, and it is because of them urging us on that we have won difficult games.”</p>

      <p>The 29-year-old is expected to start in Nelspruit tomorrow against a Team of Choice side that are on a seven-game unbeaten run of their own, but he’s confident they can get a good result.</p>
