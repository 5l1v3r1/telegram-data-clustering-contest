          <p>Gruelling, rigorous and tedious. The group stage encounters, ensured by the Super League matches were those and everything more as the eight sides partaking in the marquee league indulged themselves in a testing brand of cricket to give us the final four sides to play in the qualifier and eliminator today.</p>
          <p>And getting things underway will be the two sides who ended up sitting in the annuls of the points tally at the culmination of the Super League yesterday courtesy of their enigmatic and enterprising band of cricket. Both Maratha Arabians and Qalandars will be facing off in the first qualifier with the winner moving onto the summit clash whilst the loser will be accorded a second chance to move onto the second qualifier.</p>

                <p>With the four wins from six matches, Maratha Arabians find themselves making an advent into today’s enthralling encounter having finished atop of the league standings with just the lone defeat in the Super League. The side imbedded in place the inch perfect run chase yesterday as they ended up cantering their way to a 7 wicket win in pursuit of the 107 run target at hand.</p>
                <p>It was a an emphatic and profound performance by the side, one which will make Qalandars extremely cautious when they square off against the stalwarts after having gotten the better of Delhi Bulls yesterday. It was far from a convincing display though with their bowling unit being torn apart in the death overs and their bats just about managing to scram through to a win by 3 wickets in pursuit of 99 after some disgruntled cricket by Delhi Bulls in the culminating stages of the match.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>A fresh track with this being the first match of the day to be contested over here means we are going to be in for resplendent batting conditions. There is little, if anything at all over here for the bowlers with the surface maintaining its identity across the 40 overs to lead the side winning the toss opting to field first. </p>

                            <p>After sending down the two overs yesterday for a mere nine runs and snaring the two wickets along with it, Geroge Garton from Qalandars was always going to be an instant pick for us.
