      <p>NEW DELHI: Young Sasi Kumar Mukund on Saturday pulled out of the upcoming <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Davis-Cup">Davis Cup</a> tie against Pakistan due to a foot injury.</p>
      <p>Mukund, who was named as a reserve member, suffered the injury while playing in a tournament in Portugal.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately Sasi will not travel with us. He has informed that he sustained the injury while playing the doubles with compatriot <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Purav-Raja">Purav Raja</a>," India's Davis Cup coach <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Zeeshan-Ali">Zeeshan Ali</a> told PTI during the team's practice session at DLTA.</p>
      <p>Mukund is now the second Indian player to pull out of the tie after <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/rohan-bopanna">Rohan Bopanna</a> had withdrawn due to a shoulder injury.</p>
      <p>"I can't put my weight down properly due to the injury," said Mukund.</p>
      <p>Zeeshan said they wanted N Sriram Balaji to travel to Nur Sultan but getting visa at such short notice won't be possible.</p>
      <p>Balaji was not named in the eight-member squad but he has been with the Indian team in the training camp to help the side prepare since Thursday.</p>
      <p>Captain Rohit Rajpal, who was busy working out the doubles combination during the session, rued Mukund's absence.</p>
      <p>"It is always good to have different training partners in an away tie. You need that variety in the side. It's unfortunate," Rajpal said.</p>
      <p>Taking about the doubles combination, Rajpal said they are trying both <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Saketh-Myneni">Saketh Myneni</a> and Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan to pair with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Leander-Paes">Leander Paes</a>.</p>
      <p>"We still feel, Aisam and Aqeel may turn up for Pakistan so we are preparing all combinations. If a player like Saketh is there, Leander can dominate from the net," he said.</p>
      <p>"If Jeevan is playing with Leander then probably, it's better Leander takes care of the back side of the court since Jeevan is quick. So we are trying everything."</p>
