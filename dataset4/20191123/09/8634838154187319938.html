        <b>Deputy governors have managed to stay out of the limelight for most of their terms as their bosses take the lion's share of media publicity. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The same can be said for Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi who has managed to stay in the shadows of his boss Governor James Ongwae for both terms they have been at the helm of the county.</p>
      <p>Maangi though is not you ordinary DG, as the trained lawyer lives in a Ksh50 million palatial mansion that can be described as befitting a king. Important to note his residence was not built by the government. </p>

      <p>The villa consists of the main house, guest house, gym, conference room, swimming pool and a garden which serves as a landing spot for aircraft.</p>
      <p>Maangi, who can be described as Ruto's point man in the larger Gussi region despite being elected on an ODM ticket, claimed to have built the house before joining politics.</p>
      <p>He further told Citizen TV's Lilian Muli on Friday, November 22, 2019, that he also owns another house in the United States where other members of his family live.</p>
      <p>"I built this house before I became deputy governor, it was too expensive for me to build such a house in the US. But I also have a house there where my family stays," Maangi spoke.</p>
      <p>He has over 20 years of experience in law and marketing both in Kenya and the US. The deputy governor has a doctorate in law from William Mitchel College of Law in Minnesota, US.</p>
