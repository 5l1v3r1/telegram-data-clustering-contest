      <p>The annual No Host Bazaar held in the North Thompson Fall Fair Hall was a great success.</p>
      <p>The hall was filled with tables stacked with all manner of gift baskets, goodies, quilting, and gift ideas for the season.Local non-profit organizations participating included the Barriere and District Seniors Society, Barriere Legion, Barriere Outdoor Club, Barriere Community Quilters, Barriere Heritage Society, the North Thompson Valley Garden Club, Barriere Hospice Society, North Thompson Fall Fair and Rodeo Association and the NTFFRA Ambassador Program, just to name a few.</p>
      <p>The concession filled the hall with yummy smells wafting from the kitchen, which as a result, the concession did a booming business, and folks enjoyed a tasty lunch while visiting with old friends and new.</p>
      <p>The event was organized this year by The North Thompson Valley Garden Club.</p>
