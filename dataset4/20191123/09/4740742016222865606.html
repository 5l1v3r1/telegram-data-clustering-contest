      <h2>A word of warning for last-minute shoppers...</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Grimshaw</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/bath-christmas-market-2019-its-3336121">Bath Christmas Market</a>, with its beautifully-decorated chalets and head-turning entertainment, is always a hugely popular event.</p>
      <p>The attraction offers the perfect opportunity to pick up personal and unusual gifts for friends and family while seeing the odd Ice Queen walking around on stilits.</p>
      <p>There's also a chance to get in the festive mood by purchasing mulled wine or tucking into a freshly-made mince pie.</p>
      <p>Set out across the picture-perfect city, its estimated 400,000 people visited the market last year and the market is likely to be just as busy when it launches on November 28.</p>
      <p>But if you are hoping to visit the sparkling event, make sure you don't leave it too long.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/bath-christmas-market-2019-its-3336121">market is only running for 18 days</a>, finishing on December 15 – 10 days before Christmas Day.</p>
      <p>Kathryn Davis, Interim CEO, Visit Bath, said: “Bath Christmas Market runs for 18 days from next Thursday (November 28) to Sunday 15 December.</p>
      <p>"151 decorated chalets will line the streets around The Abbey and The Roman Baths, as well as making a return to Milsom Street which was a huge success last year.</p>
      <p>"Around 400,000 people visited the Market in 2018 with approximately 27 per cent of visitors staying overnight.</p>
      <p>"Over 90 per cent of stall holders are from Bath or the surrounding area, and this year Bath Christmas Market welcomes two new producers from Bristol; Studio Taro who will be selling their wildlife illustrated gifts and homewares, and Jekka’s who will be showcasing their locally cultivated collection of herbs, seeds and herbal infusions.</p>
      <p>"We are also delighted to have two charity chalets this year supporting 36 local charities."</p>
