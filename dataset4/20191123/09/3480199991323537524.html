      <p>Andrew Ridgeley has said there is a possibility he could take up the chance to do Strictly Come Dancing.</p>
      <p>The former Wham! star said he had previously considered taking part in the BBC One show but “just couldn’t take the leap”.</p>
      <p>Ridgeley, 56, told The Times Magazine: “I was tempted to do it. Really tempted.”</p>
      <p>Explaining why he did not hit the dance floor, he said: “I think at that time I hadn’t had a public profile for a long time. I don’t think I was ready.”</p>
      <p>He said he would “possibly” consider it now if he were offered the chance.</p>

      <p>Ridgeley rose to fame alongside George Michael in the pop group in the 1980s, but shunned the limelight for years after the band split in 1986.</p>
      <p>In the following years he was often targeted with negative media coverage, of which he said: “It was a constant sort of gnawing away. Not so much at my confidence, but at happiness, or at least contentment, in the sense that it was just something that was a constant theme.”</p>
      <p>Ridgeley – who co-wrote a number of the band’s hits including Wham! Rap and Club Tropicana, and Michael’s solo single Careless Whisper – said: “Almost anyone would have been overshadowed by (Michael’s) talent, but it was just a lot easier for the press to have a go at me.”</p>
      <p>He added: “For a while, I really wasn’t fussed about having a public profile. I have come to the realisation that I am a lot more comfortable with it than I was.</p>
      <p>“It’s 33 years since we drew Wham! to a close and a lot of people’s perspectives have changed and a lot of the rough edges have been knocked off.”</p>
      <p>Ridgeley recently released his memoir – Wham! George Michael And Me – in which he talks about the early days of the band, his friendship with Michael and the 1980s pop scene that changed their lives forever.</p>
      <p>Michael died on Christmas Day 2016 at the age of 53.</p>
