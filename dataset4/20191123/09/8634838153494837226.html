        <b>Eric Oloo, <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46684-last-moments-star-journalist-found-dead-officers-house"><i>The Star</i> journalist</a> was found dead inside a police officer's house on Thursday, November 21. Detectives are investigating an alleged love triangle after he suffered deep stab wounds on his body.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite cohabiting with the Ugunja Deputy OCS <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46650-star-newspaper-journalist-found-dead-inside-police-house"><b>Sabina Kerubo</b></a>, his 23-year-old wife <b>Lucy Atieno</b> who met the journalist in 2016, still loved him and hoped to reunite with her late husband.</p>
      <p><i>Nation </i>was first to trace the estranged wife and she recalled the last emotional conversation she had with him on a phone call. On Friday, November 22, Atieno surfaced at the deceased's home in Nyasanda Village, Ugunja.</p>

      <p>She recalled how the two had initiated a reconciliation that would have seen them reunite in February 2020, after they broke up in 2017. The two by then had an 11-day-old daughter.</p>
      <p>"He enquired what we had fed on and told me that he had shopped for our daughter's Christmas (gift), promising to have a <i>boda boda</i> operator drop them the next morning (Wednesday)," she revealed, stating that they spoke on Tuesday, November 19, three days before he was slain.</p>
      <p>Atieno further disclosed that she had partly reunited with Oloo in early 2019 and they conceived another child.</p>
      <p>Upon learning of his death via a local radio station, Atieno was heartbroken and troubled.</p>
      <p>"I dropped the baby and rushed out wailing as someone picked the child," she recalled. </p>
      <p>A witness narrated that on the night of the gruesome murder, Ugunja Deputy OCS, <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46656-police-arreset-murder-suspect-star-journalist">Sabina Kerubo</a>, arrived at around 9 p.m. at her home, with a man believed to be her lover, as Oloo slept in the bedroom. The brother of the lover later joined them and reportedly pulled Oloo out of bed and started beating him up. </p>
      <p>On Thursday, November 21, Kerubo and her supposed boyfriend were arrested in connection with the journalist's death.</p>
