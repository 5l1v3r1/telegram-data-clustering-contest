      <p>Turkey resumed operations against PKK terrorists on Saturday, in a new operation in the country's east to be run simultaneously with strikes in northern Iraq.<br/><br/>A statement released by the Ministry of National Defense said Saturday that air-backed operations are to be conducted as part of Operation Claw-3 in northern Iraq's Zap and Sinat-Haftanin provinces neutralized five terrorists who were preparing for attacks.<br/><br/>On May 27, Turkey launched Operation Claw against the PKK in the Hakurk region of northern Iraq. The ongoing offensive has eliminated dozens of terrorists. The operation has encompassed various phases -- namely Operation Claw-2, launched on July 12, and Operation Claw-3, launched on Aug. 23. All offensives have been designed to ensure security along the Iraqi border, especially the area running between southeastern Turkey's Şırnak and in northern Iraq's Sinat-Haftanin provinces.<br/><br/>All three operations have secured an area of 370 kilometers, preventing terrorists from entering Turkey or gaining a foothold in the region, which had served as the main base for the terrorists between the Turkish border and their headquarters in the Qandil mountains near the border with Iran.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry also announced Saturday that a new operation had been launched against PKK terrorists in the eastern province of Turkey. Operation Kıran-7 will involve 2,250 gendarmerie and police special operations personnel and targets terrorists in Turkey's Munzur Valley.<br/><br/>On Aug. 17, Turkey launched Operation Kıran against PKK terrorists in Van, Hakkari, and Şırnak provinces, followed by the launch of Operation Kıran-2 on Aug. 27 in Mardin, Şırnak and Batman provinces. The third phase of the operation was launched on Sept. 21 against terrorists in Bestler-Dereler and Herekol regions of Şırnak and Siirt provinces. On Sept. 24, Operation Kıran-4 was launched in the eastern Kars, Ağrı, and Iğdır provinces, followed by Operation Kıran-5 in the eastern Diyarbakır, Bingöl and Muş provinces on Nov. 8. Operation Kıran-6 was launched on Nov. 13 in the rural areas of Van, Hakkari, and Şırnak provinces.<br/><br/>In its over 30-year campaign of terror against Turkey, the PKK -- listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the EU -- has been responsible for the deaths of 40,000 people, including women, children, and infants.</p>
