      <h1>You'll Want to Cook Your Turkey at This Temperature to Avoid Serving Up Salmonella</h1>

      <p>If you ever plan on cooking a turkey in your lifetime (like maybe around Thanksgiving), there's one important piece of information you'll need to know: the internal temperature a turkey needs to reach to safely be consumed. Not knowing the answer to this important question could result in serving your guests a food-borne illness instead of a <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Holiday-Food">delicious holiday meal</a>. And no one wants to poison their extended relatives. So let's get to it.</p>
      <h3>At What Temperature Should You Cook a Turkey?</h3>
      <p>Depending on the size of your bird, you'll want to set your oven to 325°F or higher. But it's not the number on the oven you should be watching closely. The <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/poultry-preparation/lets-talk-turkey/CT_Index">USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service recommends that your turkey reach an internal temperature of at least 165°F</a> during cooking to be safely consumed based on the fact that bacteria threat salmonella cannot withstand temperatures of 160°F after 30 seconds.</p>
      <h3>In Which Part of the Turkey Should You Check the Temperature?</h3>
      <p>The key number is the breast temperature, so stress less about the thigh temperature (as long as it's over the 165°F ballpark). And if you really want the juiciest white meat possible, factor in carry-over cooking. <a href="https://www.cookscountry.com/101/holiday-turkey-101.HowTo_feature_16">America's Test Kitchen</a> says to pull the bird out of the oven at 160°F, since the residual heat from the meat will raise the temperature to 165°F as it rests for 15-20 minutes (but no more than 30). Happy carving!</p>
