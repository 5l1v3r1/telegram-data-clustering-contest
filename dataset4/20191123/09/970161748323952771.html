        <b>Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) has been under immense pressure in EastEnders as of late, and as a result she’s turned to alcohol. However, her reliance on the substance begins to cause some serious problems in the coming episodes, as she ends up having a minor car accident — and is arrested as a result.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In spite of battling a hangover, Linda agrees to take Ollie to school so that Mick can head off to his doctor’s appointment. However, problems ensue when she accidentally backs into another vehicle outside the school gates.</p>
      <p>She gives some thought about what to do for the best, but — upon realising that nobody’s seen the accident, she decides to remain shtum about the whole thing.</p>
