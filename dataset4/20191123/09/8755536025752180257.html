      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:10:09+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://goss.ie/author/kendra" target="_blank">Kendra Becker</a></address>
      <p>Cheryl, Kimberley Walsh and Nicola Roberts have slammed claims that they’ve been slating their former bandmate Nadine Coyle in a group chat.</p>
      <p>The Sun reported that the trio had been swapping messages about Nadine, and had been voting for her to do all the Bushtucker Trials.</p>
      <p>But in a rare move, the Girls Aloud stars have responded to the reports in furious statements.</p>
      <p>Speaking to MailOnline, Cheryl said: “We only want to see Nadine do well, and regardless of any differences we might have had, we will always all have love for each other.”</p>

      <p>“We did not enjoy watching her distressed when jumping out of the plane. And we don’t have time for group chats regarding the trials on the show!”</p>
      <p>Kimberley said: “I felt really emotional watching Nadine jump out of the plane and texted Cheryl saying how hard it was to watch. I think she’s doing great in there.”</p>
      <p>Agreeing with her pals, Nicola said: “We don’t have a group chat about I’m A Celebrity, this just isn’t true. We only wish Nadine the best in the jungle and hope she does well on the show.”</p>

      <p>A spokesperson also told the publication: “This story is completely fabricated and made up.”</p>
      <p>“Cheryl, Nicola and Kimberley have not been ‘plotting’ to get Nadine to do trials in I’m A Celebrity. To suggest they have been is quite frankly ridiculous.”</p>
      <p>The news comes after <a href="http://goss.ie/uk-showbiz/nadine-coyle-responds-to-claims-she-didnt-get-on-with-former-bandmate-cheryl-191294">Nadine denied reports that she didn’t get on with Cheryl during a recent episode of I’m A Celebrity.</a></p>
