      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/gavin-and-stacey/">Gavin and Stacey</a>’s Alison Steadman revealed filming the show’s upcoming Christmas special was like ‘a family reunion’ and she’s now hankering to sign up for a full series.</p>
      <p>The cast of the iconic BBC sitcom will be reunited for the first time in over decade for the new episode, which is airing on Christmas Day.</p>
      <p>All the core members of the cast – from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-corden/">James Corden</a>’s Smithy to Ruth Jones’ Nessa – will be reunited for the hour-long special, whose plot is being kept tightly under wraps.</p>
      <p>Pam Shipman herself, however, was more than happy to chat about her thoughts about returning to her most famous role.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/tv/gavin-stacey-star-alison-steadman-20938379">OK!</a>, the actress said: ‘[Filming] was brilliant. It was so good to be back on Barry Island! I really was quite nervous about it because expectations are so high.</p>

      <p>‘ I thought, “Can I do it again? Can I get the character back properly?” But as soon as we were all back together it was just like a family reunion. At the end we were all really sad to say goodbye.’</p>
      <p>Oh my Christ! We can’t handle another goodbye.</p>

      <p>Speaking on the possibility of more capers in Billericay and Barry, the Boomers star is keeping an open mind.</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘I have absolutely no idea [on more episodes]. I would love it if there was, even another special or anything. We don’t know, but never say never. Everyone seems to have clicked back together again.’</p>
      <p>Luckily, fans now don’t have long to wait for the show’s return, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/05/the-first-reviews-for-the-gavin-and-stacey-christmas-special-are-in-and-its-lush-11043406/">if the first reviews are anything to go by, it’s going to be totally lush</a>.</p>
      <p>Another star of the show (and Steadman’s on-screen, long-suffering husband) Larry Lamb also recently admitted that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/23/larry-lamb-really-sick-people-asking-gavin-stacey-making-comeback-10792776/">he was ‘sick’ of people asking if the comedy would return</a>.</p>
      <p>‘I was really getting to the point, it was so frustrating, I was going to have a roll-on tattoo that just went across my forehead and said, “Sorry, I don’t know. Don’t ask”,’ he said.</p>

      <p>There was also the surprising news that the show <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/gavin-stacey-rejected-itv-welsh-laughing-now-11056750/">was originally rejected by ITV…for being too Welsh</a>.</p>
      <p>Yep, you read that right. You can never be too Welsh!</p>
