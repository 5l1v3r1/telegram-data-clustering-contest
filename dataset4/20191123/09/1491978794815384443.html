      <h1>Sheffield United v Manchester United: match preview</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:00:50+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/23/Guardian%20Staff" target="_blank">Guardian Staff</a></address>
      <p>Chris Wilder does not want Manchester United’s visit to turn into the “Harry Maguire Show” as the club’s one-time centre-back returns to his first club. From Bramall Lane’s academy Maguire progressed to Hull, Leicester and England, ultimately becoming the world’s most expensive defender when he arrived at Old Trafford in the summer. Sheffield United’s manager said: “I usually say it’s just the next game but perhaps this one does have a little more to it. It’s Manchester United and one of our former players will be playing for them. But I don’t want it to be ‘the Harry Maguire Show’. I want it to be the Sheffield United Show. I want us to show how good we are.” Dean Henderson, the home goalkeeper on loan from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united">Manchester United</a> cannot play so Simon Moore will get a rare outing. “It’s a great opportunity for Simon,” said Wilder. “I’m sure he won’t let us down.” <b>Louise Taylor</b></p>
