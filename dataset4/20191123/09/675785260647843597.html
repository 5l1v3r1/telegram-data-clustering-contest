      <p>EastEnders Christmas spoilers have hinted a shock death could be on the cards, if the 2019 festive storyline rumours are to be believed.</p>
      <p>Keanu Taylor is tipped to lose his life as his affair with Sharon Mitchell is exposed to her husband Phil, and Keanu's fianc√©e Louise.</p>
      <p>Both Louise and stepmother Sharon fell pregnant with Keanu's babies earlier this year, with the affair reveal setting the path for some explosive scenes this Christmas Day.</p>
      <p>But Keanu wouldn't be the first death on this day, with several other Walford residents having lost their lives on Christmas Day over the years.</p>
      <p>Here's a look back at those who were killed off during the biggest episode of the year...</p>

      <h3>Jamie Mitchell</h3>
      <p>Heartthrob Jamie Mitchell, played by actor Jack Ryder, sadly lost his life on Christmas Day in 2002.</p>

      <p>Jamie appeared to be fine but suddenly deteriorated in front of his devastated girlfriend Sonia.</p>
      <p>He'd suffered a ruptured spleen, and passed away in the heartbreaking Christmas episode.</p>
      <h3>Pauline Fowler</h3>
      <p>Walford legend Pauline Fowler sadly passed away after over 20 years on the BBC soap, with her final episode being Christmas Day 2006.</p>
      <p>Pauline collapsed and died in the Square while walking her dog, by her late husband Arthur's memorial bench, with Sonia Fowler accused of killing her after a fight.</p>

      <p>It was in fact her husband Joe Macer who accidentally caused the death of Pauline, after hitting her over the head with a frying pan during a row when she dared him to hit her.</p>
      <p>Actress Wendy Richard passed away in 2009.</p>
      <h3>Derek Branning</h3>

      <p>Villain Derek Branning died from a heart attack in the Square in front of brothers Max and Jack, as well as his son Joey.</p>
      <p>He'd just been disowned by the family after his villainous ways finally caught up with him.</p>
      <p>The scenes aired on Christmas Day 2012.</p>
      <h3>Fatboy</h3>
      <p>One of the most shocking EastEnders Christmas Day deaths of all time goes to Fatboy.</p>
      <p>The character was written out of the soap in 2015, with the much-loved Walford resident crushed in a car boot.</p>

      <p>In a case of mistaken identity, Fatboy was bundled into the boot of the car before being taken to a scrap yard - with said car then crushed.</p>
      <p>It was supposed to be Vincent Hubbard in the boot, with Ronnie Mitchell involved in his demise.</p>
      <h3>Yusef Khan</h3>
      <p>An explosive Christmas Day and Boxing Day saw the death of villain Yusef Khan back in 2011.</p>
      <p>Zainab's abusive husband was trying to take his wife back to Pakistan but she finally stood up for herself, and admitted she didn't want to go.</p>
      <p>He ended up drugging her and attacking her, only for ex Masood and Yusef's daughter Afia to confront him and order him to leave for good.</p>

      <p>Masood later found him with a can of petrol and a lighter at the bed and breakfast, with the villain then attacking his rival, before lighting a fire and leaving him for dead.</p>
      <p>But a devastated Zainab lied that his daughter Afia was in the burning building causing him to run back inside - he soon realised she wasn't actually there and ended up being killed as the place exploded.</p>
      <h3>Archie Mitchell</h3>

      <p>Christmas Day 2009 saw the start of a huge new whodunnit on the BBC soap - Who Killed Archie Mitchell?</p>
      <p>Archie had been hit over the head with The Queen Vic bust by a mystery culprit.</p>
      <p>There were several suspects, but it was the show's live episode in February 2010 that confirmed Stacey Branning, now Stacey Fowler, was the killer after he raped her weeks before his death.</p>
      <h3>Abi Branning</h3>
      <p>While Abi Branning didn't technically die on Christmas Day, she was tragically declared brain stem dead after the accident that occurred then.</p>
      <p>On Christmas Day 2017, the end of Max Branning's revenge storyline saw one of the most devastating twists in the soap's history.</p>

      <p>Sisters Abi and Lauren Branning, played by Lorna Fitzgerald and Jacqueline Jossa, fell off The Queen Vic roof.</p>
      <p>They had just tried to talk their dad Max down from the roof as he threatened to take his own life.</p>

      <p>Suddenly, Lauren slipped with Abi reaching out to grab her, only for them both to tumble off the edge to the ground below.</p>
      <p>Lauren survived her injuries and went on to leave Walford, while a heavily pregnant Abi never regained consciousness - she was declared brain stem dead and her baby daughter was born via cesarean, before Abi's life support machine was switched off a few weeks after the fall in January 2018.</p>
