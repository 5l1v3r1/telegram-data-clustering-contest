      <p><b>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA/Gray News) - </b>Auburn police arrested a second suspect in connection with the disappearance of Aniah Blanchard Friday night.</p>
      <p>Antwain “Squirmy” Fisher was arrested in Montgomery on a charge of kidnapping first degree, according to Lee County District Attorney Brandon Hughes.</p>
      <p>Fisher was transported to the Lee County Jail.</p>
      <p>Authorities haven’t said how they believe Fisher was involved in the kidnapping, but more arrests and charges were anticipated in the case.</p>
      <p>Another suspect, Ibraheem Yazeed, was arrested on Nov. 7 and charged with kidnapping in the case.</p>
      <p>“That’s part of the investigation. We do not think that [Yazeed] acted alone. So we are continuing to look into that and explore that angle of the investigation,” said Auburn Police Capt. Lorenza Dorsey.</p>

      <p>Blanchard has been missing since Oct. 23. She was last seen at a convenience store in Auburn.</p>
      <p>Yazeed was recorded on surveillance video at the store at the same time as Blanchard that night. Finding Blanchard is still a top priority.</p>
      <p>“We are doing everything that we can to locate Aniah and that’s our goal, and that’s what we’re working towards, to determine her whereabouts,” Dorsey said.</p>
      <p>A witness identified Yazeed as the person he saw at the convenience store forcing Blanchard into a vehicle against her will and then leaving with her in the vehicle, according to court documents and law enforcement testimony.</p>
      <p>Blanchard’s SUV was found in Montgomery on Oct. 25.</p>
      <p>Forensic testing confirmed blood found inside the vehicle belonged to Blanchard, according to court documents.</p>
