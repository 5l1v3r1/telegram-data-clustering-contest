      <h1>VAR incorrectly overturned four key Premier League decisions on-field refs got right</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal and Manchester United were among the clubs affected by the decisions as Premier League referees chief Mike Riley urges fans to give the system more time</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:35:24+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:35</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Premier League VAR officials incorrectly overturned four big decisions in recent weeks, in what referees chief Mike Riley describes as "the worst outcome" of the new system.</p>
      <p>The new technology has come under increasing scrutiny since its introduction into the English top-flight this season, with some fans and pundits calling for it to be reviewed or scrapped until it can be improved.</p>
      <p>Decisions such as the failure to award a penalty for a handball by Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> before the international break, with Reds midfielder Fabinho scoring at the other end seconds later, have been criticised.</p>
      <p>VAR didn't intervene to overturn referee Michael Oliver on that occasion, but the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7715995/Referees-chief-admits-VAR-wrong-call-Arsenals-disallowed-winner-three-penalties.html">Mail Online</a> have now revealed the four incidents in which the changing of the on-field referee's decision by the VAR was the wrong call.</p>

      <p>"The worst outcome is when the referee on the field makes right decision and the VAR intervenes to make wrong decision," said Riley, the former Premier League official who now heads up the Professional Game Match Officials Board.</p>
      <p>"It will happen. That is part of the balance of understanding what is clear and obvious.</p>
      <p>"Look at any country that has put in VAR, everyone has to go through a learning curve. We are going through that now."</p>

      <p>The review has concluded that the VAR was wrong to disallow Sokratis Papastathopoulos' late goal for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> last month, with the match finishing in a 2-2 draw amid controversy surrounding Granit Xhaka.</p>
      <p>In addition, it is said that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> shouldn't have been awarded a penalty against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> last month when Michael Keane stepped on Aaron Connolly's foot in a game at the Amex Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Seagulls went on score the spot-kick and win 3-2.</p>

      <p>The on-field referees also failed to point to the spot when Manchester United's Daniel James was 'fouled' by Norwich defender Ben Godfrey, and Watford's Gerard Deulofeu went down in the vicinity of Chelsea's Jorginho.</p>
      <p>Both were eventually given as penalties, but the on-field official's initial decision should have been allowed to stand.</p>

      <p>Despite the problems, Riley is pleading with fans to give the system more of a chance.</p>
      <p>"Let's not look at what might have happened so far," he continued.</p>
      <p>"Let's take all these learnings and go how do we improve the system going forward because we've all got a stake in making sure that happens."</p>
