      <p>When overweight Paul Cole couldn’t keep up with his sporty schoolboy son, he realised he had to change his unhealthy lifestyle.</p>
      <p>Weighing in at 21-and-a-half stone Paul could only sit on a park bench and watch Nathan play football.</p>
      <p>With a growing 48-inch waist Paul found it difficult to even tie his own shoe laces and got out of breath just walking up the stairs.</p>
      <p>But wanting to join in with his son’s activities gave him the light bulb moment he needed to shed his fat.</p>

      <p>Now Paul is almost seven stone lighter and is down to a size 32 waist.</p>
      <p>“It all started about eight years ago when my son was about eight years old. He was, and still is, very sporty, with football being his main passion. I couldn’t play with him at all, I used to take him to the park and sit on a bench and watch while he played on his own,” said Paul, 51, of Deckham, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead">Gateshead.</a></p>
      <p>“My eating habits were terrible, because of my job at the time as a manager of a recruitment agency meant it was easier to use takeaways and pre-prepared food rather than cook myself. I love to cook but even when I did I would use lots of oil and cream in our meals.</p>
      <p>“I was a serial dieter, tried every weight loss plan around, and even though I’d lost weight couldn’t maintain a weight loss because I wasn’t changing habits.</p>

      <p>“I’d lose a stone but then go back to takeaways, frozen food and cooking as I had before. Then a friend recommended Slimming World, and although sceptical, I joined my local group. I was nervous, apprehensive and thought that I’d be the only man in the room.</p>
      <p>“My consultant met me at the door, introduced me to Food Optimising and like many others thought I can’t possibly eat all this food and lose weight. I changed the way I cooked, swapping oil for one cal cooking spray, getting rid of the jars of sauce and cooked from fresh. If I needed a recipe the other members in the group would give me ideas, the support was brilliant.</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t believe it when I stepped on the scales for my first weigh in and had lost 10.5lb and in my fourth week I was two stone lighter. I reached my target weight in nine months losing six stone.”</p>
      <p>Paul was so thrilled with himself that he decided he wanted to help others.</p>

      <p>He added: “I decided that I wanted to help others feel like I felt so opened my first Slimming World group in May 2012, my second group in 2013 and became a Team Developer in 2015.</p>
      <p>“Helping other people did affect my weight and I gained two stone over a couple years, but put the focus back on me in June this year and have lost that two stone and a further two stone taking my total weight loss to seven stone.</p>
      <p>“I feel amazing, I still enjoy a night out and a takeaway - I just make better choices.</p>
      <p>“I can now keep up with Nathan, who is now 16, and have introduced activity to my life. I attend the gym to help keep me at my target weight, and what is great is that both Nathan and I attend the gym together regularly.</p>
      <p>“My life has changed so much, it’s the little things like being able to bend over to tie shoe laces, get down on the floor to play with my grandchildren, not being out of breath walking up a flight of stairs and not being tired all of the time.</p>
      <p>“My passion for Slimming World has never faltered and I currently run two Slimming World groups, one in Pelaw and the other at Gateshead Leisure Centre and in addition look after the Gateshead Team of Slimming World consultants helping thousands of members lose weight every week.</p>
      <p>“I feel absolutely great now.”</p>
      <p>Paul runs his groups at Hertfordshire House Community Centre, Rothbury Avenue, Pelaw, Gateshead, on Fridays at 9.30am and 11.30am and at Gateshead Leisure Centre on Saturdays at 8am, 10am and 12 noon. For more information call Paul on 07771693148.</p>
