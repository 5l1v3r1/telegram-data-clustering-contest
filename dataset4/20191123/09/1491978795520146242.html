        <i>Stories from the Windrush generation and a full exposé of the scandal that disgraced the Home Office</i>
      </p>
      <p>It reads like dystopian fiction. British citizens who have lived, loved, parented and paid tax in the UK for decades begin to receive menacing text messages and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/22/government-aware-for-years-that-hostile-environment-hurt-windrush-generation">threatening letters from the</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/22/government-aware-for-years-that-hostile-environment-hurt-windrush-generation"> government</a>. The communications tell them, contrary to their own understanding, that they are illegal immigrants. They go into work one day to be told that their new illegal status means they no longer have a job. People with ongoing health troubles turn up to scheduled treatments to be presented with a bill of tens of thousands of pounds before they can be seen. A visit to the jobcentre reveals that the benefits they are entitled to have been denied or revoked. They are even refused food bank vouchers. Many Britons are acquainted with the Windrush persecution. But this book by Amelia Gentleman, the Guardian journalist who broke the story, exposes it in its shocking reality.</p>
      <p>Gentleman meticulously details the specifics that led to one of the biggest political scandals of the decade, providing a context for her reports that even those who closely followed the story will find valuable. The Home Office’s “hostile environment” policies attempted to inject hostility and suspicion into every interaction with the state. Through first-person accounts from the people affected, <i>The Windrush Betrayal</i> knits together a devastating picture of the human cost of punitive immigration policies.</p>
      <p>Gentleman provides a deft account of the relevant colonial history, of which many Britons are still ignorant. The targeted men and women had travelled to the UK as children, often on a parent’s passport, at a time when their origin countries were imperial possessions. They were British subjects. The children grew up; lives were built while immigration acts changed. Fast forward to this decade, when Ukip’s creeping influence on Conservative party policy led to what can only be described as a repatriation drive. (Consider the billboards that said “Go Home or Face Arrest”, and the Home Office tweet from 2013: “#Rosesareredvioletsareblue, if your marriage is a sham we’ll be on to you ... #happyvalentinesday”.) Gentleman writes that 164 people were wrongly held in immigration detention, and 83 were wrongly removed from the country. All were stripped of dignity.</p>
      <p>By the time I had got to the middle of the book, with all the government incompetence exposed, I was feeling very angry. Gentleman tells the story of Jocelyn John, who was practically coerced into self-deportation by the government. She had arrived in Britain as a small child on her mother’s passport in 1963. The country they had left, Grenada, was still under British rule. She has spent the vast majority of her life in Britain. A lost passport and family name change when she was a child left her vulnerable to the hostile environment. She began to receive letters informing her that she was illegal, and threatening her with impending detention. She gave up trying to prove her legitimacy in late 2016, acquiescing to Home Office officials who booked her on to a flight to a country she’d last lived in when she was four.</p>
      <p>Many of us have lost or misplaced identity documents, but with no such dramatic consequence. The Kafkaesque situation that faced those caught up in the process of trying to prove that they had a right to live in Britain is simply mind-boggling. Many were never offered the chance to speak to a government official – a human being.</p>
      <p>The book tells the remarkable story of how Gentleman exposed a cruel and inhumane policy and forced the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/29/amber-rudd-resigns-as-home-secretary-after-windrush-scandal">resignation of home secretary Amber Rudd</a>. When she began reporting, she was met with blank faces at the Home Office. Barely a year later, that response had evolved into panicked, scrambled emergency. I found myself cringing as<b> </b>Rudd’s evasions about removal targets were exposed.</p>
      <p>A lesser journalist might have determined that the initial Home Office nonchalance meant that there wasn’t a story to chase. Gentleman decides against the traditional non-fiction approach of dispassionate narration. Justice is what matters here. Her candid admissions of rage as she recalls the unfolding of the scandal are refreshing to read. Equally winning is her decision not to let this anger poison her view of Home Office staff. She tries to understand the pressures on those enforcing hostile environment policies, revealing poor practices, budget cuts and low morale. The compassionate approach works in her favour; one of her sources is revealed as a former employee of the department in charge of storing vital data. Her reporting proves why an independent free press is so vital for democracy. The book is dense with facts, but the real thread running through it is a human one.</p>

      <p>Colin Grant’s <i>Homecoming</i>, a collection of oral histories, provides a rich context to the scandal, as it tells the stories of the kind of people who may have found themselves caught up in it. The author opens with an account of his parents, but then focuses on other black Britons, as they recall their lives and schooling in the West Indies. We learn about the decisions taken to move to Britain in the middle of the century, and what it was like to make the journey. There are tales of arriving in England, trying to get settled and facing racism. Edwin Hilton Hall, an interviewee, bitterly recalls the extreme racism he faced around the time of the Notting Hill riots. “We couldn’t even go quietly in a shop without them abusing us: ‘blackie, nigger, moonshine’.” Another interviewee, Shirley Williams, speaks in a resigned manner about the realities of her nursing job: “If there was a derogatory remark made to you, it had to go over your head, you could not report it. Who do you report it to?” Alongside such anecdotes are snippets of previously published or broadcast interviews and writing, such as Sam Selvon’s novel <i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/oct/09/reading-group-the-lonely-londoners-by-sam-selvon-is-our-book-for-october">The Lonely Londoners</a></i>.</p>
      <p>It is through these stories that the psychological effect of Britain’s colonial project on those it considered its subjects comes into full view. It was painful to read Grant’s account of asking his relatives about his family tree. Their recollection stops at slavery, as though they came into existence because of the British. This is a book in part about gross imbalances of power.</p>
      <p>The structure of <i>Homecoming</i> gives its subjects space to speak for themselves, with each vignette providing a glimpse into little known history. Jumping from story to story made me want a more continuous narrative, but Grant’s collection of voices, like <i>The Windrush Betrayal</i>, exposes effectively the cruel logic of Britain’s legacy of domination. Britishness was instilled in the colonies; interviewees speak of celebrating Empire Day at school; Britain was the mother country. Many of the narratives of those who left the places they were born in reveal an impermanence, a drive to be at the centre, their sense of waiting to arrive. Arrival meant Britain.</p>
      <p>For decades, life was rarely easy. Then the hostile environment took a sharper institutional form; and too many suffered vile treatment and state violence.</p>
