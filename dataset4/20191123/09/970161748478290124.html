      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/elizabeth-banks/">Elizabeth Banks</a> shocked viewers watching <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/graham-norton/">The Graham Norton Show</a> with a totally unexpected joke about <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a>.</p>
      <p>Appearing on the show alongside <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ricky-gervais/">Ricky Gervais</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kylie-minogue/">Kylie Minogue</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lewis-hamilton/">Lewis Hamilton</a>, Graham attempted to embarrass the actress with a hilarious throwback photo from her teens, sporting a stylish white polo neck with matching white hoops with her hair in its naturally curly state.</p>
      <p>‘That’s my hair,’ Elizabeth laughed, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ricky-gervais/">Ricky Gervais</a> joking: ‘Sorry, that’s a tree behind you?’</p>

      <p>‘That’s Marge Simpson hair,’ Graham added.</p>
      <p>‘But look how proud I am,’ Elizabeth added. ‘I made that necklace myself, I was not really allowed to wear hoop earrings until I was older, those were probably some of my first hoop earrings.’</p>
      <p>Pointing at the hand lurking in the picture, Graham said: ‘I’ve only just noticed this hand, is it someone saying, “you’ll regret this photograph.”’</p>

      <p>‘That’s Prince Andrew’s hand,’ the 45-year-old actress shot back, prompting gasps from her fellow guest Kylie Minogue and Ricky while the audience offered her uproarious laughter.</p>
      <p>‘Oh God, Jesus,’ Ricky said, while Graham insisted: ‘Photoshop, it’s just Photoshop.’</p>

      <p>And it seems the viewers at home were just as impressed with Elizabeth’s edgy humour as the live audience.</p>
      <p>‘”That’s Prince Andrew’s hand!” Oh @ElizabethBanks you are bloody hysterical #GrahamNortonShow,’ a fan wrote, while another posted: ‘Her comment about Prince Andrew love that.’</p>

      <p>Elizabeth’s comment was made all the more impressive given the show’s all-star guest list, with viewers wondering how <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/elizabeth-banks-on-not-labelling-kristen-stewarts-charlies-angels-characters-sexuality-11071232/">the Charlie’s Angels director</a> had somehow managed to make the most outrageous joke on a sofa that included <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ricky-gervais/">Ricky Gervais</a>.</p>

      <p>‘Even @rickygervais thinking, “Ooh I wouldn’t have gone there” about Elizabeth Banks’s Prince Andrew joke,’ one Twitter user wrote.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Banks: 1, everyone else: 0.</p>
