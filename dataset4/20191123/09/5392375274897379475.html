      <p>The Chinese smartphone maker <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/oneplus">OnePlus</a> has yet once again been hit by a major data breach. In this data leak by hackers, the brand has disclosed that “unauthorized party” got a hold on some customers’ order information. The smartphone maker started informing its affected users this Friday i.e. November 22 via email. It is worth mentioning that the actual breach took place last week. Those who have not received any email are safe. Information such as names, contact addresses, phone numbers, and emails may have been in the hands of the unauthorized party. OnePlus has claimed that the other sensitive information such as payments, passwords, and accounts itself are secure.</p>
      <h3>OnePlus Discloses Data Breach, Impacted Customers Informed</h3>
      <p>For those who’re unaware, OnePlus witness similar breach back in January last year which resulted in the leak of even payment information and passwords of numerous impacted customers. Furthermore, the brand has claimed that only a particular subset of orders has been exposed. However, the company didn’t disclose the number of users as well as which part of the world that was impacted by the breach. As a result of this current breach, affected users may receive spam and phishing emails.</p>
      <p>This time the hacker’s entry point was a loophole in the company’s official website. As soon as the brand discovered the breach, the smartphone maker immediately took the necessary actions. Additionally, OnePlus has made sure that no other similar vulnerabilities are present on their online e-commerce platform. To keep <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2018/10/09/google-google-plus/">breaches</a> like this from happening in the future, the brand is partnering with a world-renowned security platform next month. By the end of this year, the smartphone maker will announce the official bug bounty program.</p>
      <p>Reiterating, if you have not received the official email from OnePlus, then you are data is secure and safe. Although you can still get in touch with the company if you have any queries related to the breach. On the other hand, if you have received the email, then there is nothing to do on your end. You might receive unnecessary spams on your email as well as the phone number.</p>
