      <p>Goals from Jake Gricius and Tyson Kozak staked the Winterhawks to a 2-0 lead after the first period of play.</p>

      <p>Goncalves and Bryce Kindopp scored in the third period, but Everett’s last-gasp rally fell just short.</p>
      <p>Dustin Wolf stopped 30 of 34 shots for the Silvertips (15-5-1-0).</p>
      <p>Joel Hofer stopped 28-of-31 shots for the Winterhawks (14-5-1-2).</p>
