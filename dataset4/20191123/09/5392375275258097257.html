      <p>Vivo has traced an unusual path with the V17 series. After announcing  V17 Neo and V17 Pro in August and September respectively, the company decided that now it’s time to unveil the vanilla Vivo V17. Interestingly enough, the new device is just a rebranded Vivo S1 Pro which debuted the Philippines earlier this week.</p>
      <h3>Vivo V17 specifications</h3>
      <p>The Vivo V17 Pro boasts a 6.38″ Super AMOLED display that has a 2340×1080 pixel resolution. Furthermore, it features a u-shaped notch at the top and under-display fingerprint scanner. The notch serves as a house for the 32MP selfie snapper. Moving around to the back, there is a unique diamond-shaped Quad-Camera setup. This setup comprises of a 48MP main camera, an 8MP ultrawide, 2MP macro, and 2MP depth sensor.</p>

      <p>Despite the premium appeal and the AMOLED display, the handset features a mid-range SOC. It’s the Snapdragon 665 chipset, the favorite choice of many brands in the mid-range segment. The chipset is paired with 8GB of RAM, which is overkill considering the chipset’s power. The handset features 128GB of Internal Storage, but if it isn’t enough for you, it also supports microSD cards up to 256GB.</p>
      <p>The handset draws power from a 4,500mAh battery that charges with an 18W standard via the USB Type-C port. Other features include a 3.5mm headphone jack and come with an NFC chip for contactless payments. It features FunTouch OS 9.2 which runs atop of Android 9 Pie.</p>
      <p>The vivo V17 is available in Cloud Blue and Blue Fog colors. Customers in Russia can <a href="https://www.vivo.com/ru/products/v17">pre-order it</a> for RUB22,990 ($360/€325) till December 5. Pre-bookers will receive a free Vivo Y11.</p>
