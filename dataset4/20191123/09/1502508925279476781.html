      <p>BJP's Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday took oath as Maharashtra chief minister, while <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ajit-pawar">Ajit Pawar </a>as his deputy.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ncp">NCP </a>leader Dhananjay Munde has been contacted. Ajit Pawar may also return (to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ncp">NCP </a>fold). We have information how Ajit Pawar has been blackmailed and will expose this soon," Raut told reporters.</p>
      <p>Munde, who is said to have been in touch with Fadnavis since the last few days, had gone incommunicado. He is said be supporting Ajit Pawar.</p>
      <p>Munde was elected from Parli where he defeated his cousin and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bjp">BJP </a>leader Pankaja Munde.</p>
      <p>"The new government was formed at 7 in the morning. In the cover of darkness only sins are committed," Raut said.</p>
