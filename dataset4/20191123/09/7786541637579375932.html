      <p><b>BERLINÂ (AP)</b> - The governor of a northern German state has urged citizens to join a rally against a far-right protest in Hannover.</p>
      <p>Lower Saxony's Stephan Weil asked people to rally against a protest Saturday by the far-right NPD party, which is marching to intimidate journalists who have reported critically about the nationalist party.</p>
      <p>Hannover police had tried to ban the NPD from protesting, but a court decided late Friday that the far-right protest can go ahead.</p>
      <p>Some 100 far-right protesters are expected Saturday while about 2,000 counter-demonstrators said they'd come to rally for press freedom and show their support for the embattled journalists.</p>
      <p>The NPD had advertised their march by posting a picture online of a broadcast journalist who has done in-depth reporting about the far-right scene in Germany.</p>
