      <h1>Pete Davidson And Kaia Gerber Spotted Smooching &amp; What Is This Man’s Secret, Seriously</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:20:31+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:20</time> by <a rel="author">By Josephine Rozenberg-Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Look, I don’t mean to be a bitch here but <b>Pete</b> <b>Davidson</b> consistently manages to surprise me with the calibre of women he dates. No, life’s not all about looks. Yes, he’s very funny. Sure, he could be a great person, I don’t know him personally. But seriously: <b>Cazzie</b> <b>David</b>, <b>Ariana</b> <b>Grande</b>, <b>Kate</b> <b>Beckinsale</b>, <a href="https://www.pedestrian.tv/entertainment/pete-davidson-margaret-qualley-venice/"><b>Margaret</b> <b>Qualley</b></a> and now <b>Kaia</b> <b>Gerber</b>. The top-tier ladies, they love him.</p>
      <p>Before you clutch your pearls, we’re all thinking it, apart from some readers who will undoubtedly come for me in the comments for the headline of this article and the double-standards and blah-di-blah. To them I say: it’s Saturday night, my sixth day straight of work, and I’ll write what I bloody want.</p>

      <p>Anyway, that aside, the reason you came here was to learn about Pete Davidson and Kaia Gerber and their PDA-filled beach visit, no? Good. So just in the past fortnight 18-year-old model Kaia — daughter of 90s supermodel legend <b>Cindy Crawford</b> — and 26-year-old Saturday Night Live star Pete confirmed their relationship by holding hands in public, which was captured by <a href="https://people.com/tv/pete-davidson-and-kaia-gerber-spotted-holding-hands/">People</a> if you want to have a squiz.</p>
      <p>And now he pair have kicked the PDA up a notch by having a big old smooch session on the beach in Miami, which eagle-eyed photographers of course snapped pics of and of course the Daily Mail bought them. I do not have these photos, but if you want to have a perve they’re right <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7716869/Kaia-Gerber-flaunts-taut-tummy-bikini-beach-beau-Pete-Davidson.html">HERE</a>.</p>
      <p>The couple appeared to be having a lovely time on their beach date, so perhaps my earlier theory that Pete is a nice person is spot-on.</p>

      <p>As for how they got together in the first place, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/au/news/1094223/kaia-gerber-gives-pete-davidson-a-sweet-birthday-present">E! News previously quoted</a> a source that said:</p>
      <blockquote>They have been friends for a while now and run in the same friend circle, but became romantic recently. They started hanging out alone more often after meeting up in NYC in October. They have been texting a lot this past month, and are definitely seeing where it goes.</blockquote>
      <p>A tale as old as time.</p>
