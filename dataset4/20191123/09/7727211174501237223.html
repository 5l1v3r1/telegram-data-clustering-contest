      <p>A woman escaped jail despite admitting she attempted to blackmail a Premier League footballer who jumped out of a hotel window in his pants after they were caught in bed together.</p>
      <p>Natalie Wood, 28, plotted to expose the high-profile footballer she met on social media as a “love rat” after discovering he was in a relationship with another woman.</p>
      <p>She had met the soccer star twice before, but hatched a plan with three men to film her with the star and <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/crime">blackmail</a> him by threatening to sell a “kiss and tell” story.</p>
      <p>But Wood was sentenced to 14 months - suspended for 12 months - after a judge allowed her to change her guilty plea of conspiracy to blackmail to attempted blackmail.</p>

      <p>Bristol Crown Court heard Nathan Coleman and Prince Rowe burst in on Wood and the footballer as they lay in a hotel room bed in 2018 and caught the 'act' on film.</p>
      <p>The court heard Wood hatched the plan after meeting up with the footballer twice before and arranged to meet for a third time in snare him in the 'honey trap'.</p>
      <p>The sportsman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, fled by jumping from the window in just his underwear.</p>
      <p>He ran down a fire escape before he took shelter in a nearby restaurant and called the police.</p>
      <p>Wood, from Cleethorpes, Lincs, sent the star a message saying: “I don’t really want to expose you to the media but if you don’t respond within 24 hours then you leave me no choice.”</p>
      <p>The star left behind a designer tracksuit and a £24,000 Rolex watch which were later found in the possession of Rowe.</p>

      <p>Nathan Coleman, 38, of Sussex, his brother Tyrone Coleman, 34, from Birmingham, and Prince Rowe, 37, were all cleared of conspiracy to blackmail during a trial last month.</p>
      <p>Coleman (Nathan) was also acquitted of three charges of theft and a fourth man, Ras Robinson, 37, of Birmingham, was acquitted of handling stolen goods, relating to the star's Rolex.</p>
      <p>Rowe Prince, 37, from Birmingham, was convicted of two counts of theft relating to designer tracksuit and a £24,000 Rolex watch.</p>
      <p>Judge Martin Picton said it was “legal nonsense” for Wood to be solely convicted for conspiracy to blackmail and argued she had been “manipulated”, “used” and had acted in a “foolish” way. </p>
      <p>He said: “Blackmail has the power to do great harm to others but I have no doubt you were subject to manipulation. </p>
      <p>“This case has troubled me a great deal. I am satisfied the plea you have entered is more appropriate and allows me to reach an appropriate decision.</p>
      <p>“You were subject to manipulation, were used and have been deeply foolish.”</p>
      <p>Rowe was sentenced to 16 months prison for the theft of the footballer's designer tracksuit and £23,000 Rolex.</p>
      <p>Judge Martin Picton said: “He chose to steal the watch and the tracksuit and treat them as his own.</p>
      <p>“The circumstances allowed for the opportunistic theft and he had every opportunity of benefiting from it. </p>
      <p>“He has engaged in serious criminality in the past. You and the others set him up (the player) and did so with a great deal of planning an determination. </p>
      <p>“You got your hands on his watch and was determined to realise the value of it.”</p>
