      <h1>Mercedes-AMG Reconfirms GT Black Series, Hybrid GT 4-Door For 2020</h1>
      <h2>Straight from AMG's global head of product management and sales.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:41:51+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/jacob-oliva/" target="_blank">Jacob Oliva</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.motor1.com/mercedes-benz/amg-gt/">Mercedes-AMG GT</a> is no push-over sports car. In fact, it's most <i>anemic</i> version produces 469 horsepower (350 kiloWatts) and 465 pound-feet (630 Newton-meters) of torque, coming from the 4.0-liter V8 with boosts coming from twin turbochargers. It's current most-powerful version, the GT R, makes way more than that at 577 hp (430 kW) and 516 lb-ft (700 Nm) of twists.</p>
      <p>But AMG isn't about to let its guard down in making its sports car even greater. Spied testing a number of times on public roads this year, the AMG GT Black Series is bound to happen – and AMG's global head of product management and sales, Michael Knöller, has confirmed that it's arriving sooner than we think.</p>
