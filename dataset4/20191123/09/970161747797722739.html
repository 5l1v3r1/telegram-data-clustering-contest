        <b>Unlucky-in-love Bernice Blackstock (Samantha Giles) has finally found the perfect man in Dr Liam Cavanagh (Jonny McPherson) in Emmerdale, and she’s set to marry him in the coming episodes, as the week of their wedding arrives. However, daughter Dee Dee makes a shocking discovery before they walk down the aisle — and it’s one that could change everything. Could this new information perhaps lead to Bernice’s impending exit?</b>
      </p>
      <p>With her wedding to Liam on the horizon, Bernice couldn’t be happier — that is, until Liam reveals that he’s got her a gift for their big day. Naturally, Bernice panics, worried about the fact that she hasn’t acquired him something in return.</p>
      <p>After Dee Dee reveals that she’s starting school in Emmerdale as a wedding present for her mum, Bernice becomes rather overwhelmed, so — instead of acquiring a gift for her intended — she sets about making a grand gesture.</p>

      <p>However, when Leanna (Mimi Slinger) gets wind of Bernice’s plan, she’s upset that she wasn’t asked for help in deciding said gift for her dad.</p>

      <p>In an attempt to make up for not asking her advice, Bernice suggests that Leanna could help organise the hen do instead.</p>

      <p>The hens all celebrate at the party — although Bernice’s’ daughters are mortified when a stripper shows up. However, during the celebrations, Bernice misses several calls.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Dee Dee takes a call — and ends making a shocking discovery that could well change everything.</p>
      <p>What is it that Dee Dee’s learned?</p>
      <p>What’s more, will it prevent Bernice from getting her happy-ever-after?</p>
      <p>We know that actress Samantha Giles is soon set to depart from the Dales, so chances are this discovery could be tied to Bernice’s impending exit.</p>
