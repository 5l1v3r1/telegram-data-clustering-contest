      <h1>Only two Liverpool players are among the top-10 most valuable in the world, according to Transfermarkt</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:19:50+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Only two Liverpool men â€“ Mo Salah and Sadio Mane â€“ have been named as being among the top-10 most valuable players in world football in the latest <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/marktwertetop/wertvollstespieler">Transfermarkt</a> rankings.</p>
      <blockquote>Mbappe â€“ 2âƒ£0âƒ£ years old<br/>Neymar â€“ 2âƒ£7âƒ£ years old<br/>Surprised by the most valuable players in the world ranking? ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤” <a href="https://t.co/9RxS8lKxVN">pic.twitter.com/9RxS8lKxVN<br/></a>â€” Alfredo ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­ (@AsemahBoadi) <a href="https://twitter.com/AsemahBoadi/status/1197531985025126405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>Mane makes the cut, but only just, while Salah is behind only Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. The likes of Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold, who might have been expected to be there, miss out completely.</p>
      <p>Mane, valued at less than Antoine Griezmann and Kevin de Bruyne, seems to have been particularly hard done by. Heâ€™s been one of the very best players in the world for some time now.</p>
      <p>Eden Hazard, meanwhile, has been overrated quite a lot, factoring in his age and his time at the Bernabeu so far. Raheem Sterling and Mane should definitely be ahead of him.</p>
      <p>Itâ€™s not clear exactly how the values are attributed to the players, but Reds fans are likely to be questioning at least a couple of those values.</p>
