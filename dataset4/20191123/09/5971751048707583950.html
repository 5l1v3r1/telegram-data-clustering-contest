      <p>Analysts at Canalys posted their report concerning the smartphone market of Europe during the 3rd quarter of 2019. In the 3rd quarter, Europe saw a great increase in smartphone shipments of 8%, with Samsung continuing to dominate the Old Continent.</p>

      <p>Samsung grabbed over a third of the market share, followed by Huawei that stagnated year-on-year, but increased shipments on quarterly level by 3 million. The third was Apple with a decline year-on-year, but, similar to Huawei, a 50% growth compared to the 2nd quarter of 2019 because of new iPhone models. On the fourth place is Xiaomi with an amazing 73% year-on-year growth and 10.5% market share.</p>
      <p>The marker of Nokia smartphones, HMD Global was on number five, but with just 1.8% of market share. The European market is dominated by 4 big brands, and even the recent efforts by the BBK Group or Huawei’s geopolitical troubles didn’t change that.</p>
      <p>Nokia smartphone shipments declined 21% compared to the same period last year, so in Q3 2019 HMD shipped 0.9 million smartphones in Europe. Counterpoint <a href="https://nokiamob.net/2019/11/01/nokia-brand-ranked-13th-in-smartphones-and-2nd-in-feature-phones-in-q3-2019/">approximated HMD Global’s global shipments to around 3.8 million</a>, so Europe makes around a quarter of HMD’s shipments.</p>
      <p>The trend of decreasing sales in Europe continues, though, and we will see if the trend will change in Q4 2019.</p>
