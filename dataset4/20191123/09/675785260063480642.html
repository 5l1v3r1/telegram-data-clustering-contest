      <h2>Smith and Ryder clash in an all-British clash for the former's world super-middleweight title in Liverpool</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>John Ryder faces a huge challenge tonight when he challenges for Callum Smith's super-middleweight world title.</p>
      <p>Smith defends his belt for the second time since he won it by beating George Groves in the final of the World Boxing Super Series in Saudi Arabia last year.</p>
      <p>He comfortably defeated Hassan N'Dam on the undercard of Anthony Joshua's shock defeat by Andy Ruiz Jr in June but has struggled to secure the super-fights he craves.</p>
      <p>Ryder meanwhile comes into tonight's fight as a dark horse having battled from defeats by Billy Joe Saunders, Rocky Fielding, Jack Arnfield and Nick Blackwell to secure a mandatory shot at Smith.</p>
      <p>Here is everything you need to know about tonight's fights...</p>
      <h3>What TV channel is it on?</h3>
      <p>The fights will be broadcast on Sky Sports. The programme will start at 7pm on Sky Sports action and can also be watched on Sky Sports Main Event from 8.30pm.</p>

      <h3>Latest news</h3>
      <p>Callum Smith believes he will get the credit he deserves when he ends up having a few wars.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool super-middleweight makes the second defence of his WBA title against fellow Brit John Ryder at the M&amp;S Bank Arena on Merseyside.</p>
      <p>Smith, 29, is eyeing up a huge 2020 which could include a big fight at Anfield, the home of his beloved Liverpool, in May.</p>
      <p>He already reached the top of the 12st division when he dethroned George Groves just over a year ago in the final of the World Boxing Super Series.</p>
      <p>But the Scouse scrapper has not been given huge plaudits despite his success in the ring.</p>
      <p>He did take time out following the win over Groves when his daughter Alba was born which maybe took some of the momentum away.</p>
      <p>But he also feels that sometimes it has been too easy for him on his big nights which left his best wins overlooked.</p>
      <p>“Coming through I remember boxed Nikola Sjekloca, he had lost twice on points to world champions Sakio Bika and Arthur Abraham,” ‘Mundo’ said.</p>
      <p>“If I beat him in a war people would have said, ‘Fair play for fighting him so early’. Because I whitewashed him on points it was like, ‘Sjekloca wasn’t very good’.</p>
      <p>“It was the same when I beat Rocky Fielding. I was 17-0, he was 21-0 and it was a big local derby and I won in a round.</p>
      <p>“If I had a war and scraped by I would have gotten more credit and exposure.</p>
      <p>“But I’ve got my own goals, my own pressure, my own targets.</p>
      <p>“It’s not really frustrating. I got into boxing for myself, not to get the approval of everyone.</p>
      <p>“I don’t do anything for people not to like me, but you will still get people who won’t.”</p>
