      <p>A mum has found a simple cleaning hack which will get your carpets looking as good as new.</p>
      <p>Posting on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/263873787588466/?ref=group_header">Hinch Army Cleaning Tips Facebook page</a>, Manda Goody said her carpet had lost its shine no matter how much she hoovered.</p>
      <p>But the Mrs Hinch fan was stunned when a 59p cleaning trick cleared the muck out of her floor.</p>
      <p>And other fans of the cleaning guru and Instagram sensation are seriously impressed.</p>
      <p>"You lovely Hinchers have done it again. I have a lovely silver grey carpet which lately has become a bit dull and I’m always hoovering but it had lost its lovely look," Manda wrote.</p>
      <p>"I saw the post about trapped hair and how hoovering doesn’t get it out. So I bought a squeegee for 59p and gave it a go."</p>

      <p>The results were impressive, as <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/mrs-hinch-fans-stunned-mums-17280959">Birmingham Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>"This is my daughter's bedroom carpet. She has very long hair. I was totally shocked at how much came up and a bit disgusted to be honest," Manda wrote.</p>
      <p>"My carpet now looks brand new again! If you haven’t tried it yet do it!”</p>
      <p>Other members of the Hinch cleaning group were just as impressed by the results.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "I do this every week now. Amazing how much hair and dust comes up. Only thing is my squeegee doesn't last long."</p>
      <p>Another added: "I do my stairs often and the amount that comes off is crazy!"</p>
      <p>There were also tips, to make the job even easier.</p>
      <p>"You can get a rubber brush (Home Bargains) which makes the job much easier," One wrote.</p>
      <p>Another added: "I've also got a hideous pair of rubber sliders that are used specifically for this. They clean the carpet and it's a work out to boot."</p>
