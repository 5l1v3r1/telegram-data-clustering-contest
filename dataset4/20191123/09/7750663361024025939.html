      <h1>Scott Parker "really pleased" for Aboubakar Kamara after match-winning brace</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/scott-parker/"><b>Scott Parker</b></a> insisted both <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/fulham/"><b>Fulham</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/aboubakar-kamara/"><b>Aboubakar Kamara</b></a> have put last season's controversy behind them after the striker scored twice to sink QPR 2-1.</h2>

      <p>Kamara's Craven Cottage career looked over in January after a series of bust-ups, one of which saw him arrested, banned from the club and then sent on loan to Turkish side Malatyaspor.</p>
      <p>Yet Cottagers boss Parker has reintegrated Kamara into the squad and, with 12-goal top-scorer <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/aleksandar-mitrovic/"><b>Aleksandar Mitrovic</b></a> suspended, turned to the Frenchman to lead the line against Rangers.</p>
      <p>Parker was rewarded with a goal in each half as Fulham came from behind to beat their west London rivals and climb up to fourth in the Sky Bet Championship table.</p>
      <p>Parker said: "I'm really pleased for him. He has not been a problem since I stepped into the role.</p>
      <p>"You have to manage him differently but he gives you everything and he topped off his performance with two really good finishes. The perception is very different to the reality.</p>
      <p>"What happened last season with Abou is well documented but he has come back into the squad with the blessing of the players. They are fully on board.</p>
      <p>"He has not been involved much this season, and he has his moments, but he is a grafter and he works hard and he deserved his goals."</p>
      <p>Rangers were ahead inside three minutes, when Todd Kane drilled a low centre across goal and Jordan Hugill, on a season-long loan from West Ham, arrived at the far post to steer the ball into the net.</p>
      <p>But when Denis Odoi crossed from the right Kamara – making only his second start of the season – headed his first Fulham goal since netting the consolation in a 4-1 defeat at Arsenal on New Year's Day.</p>
      <p>Fulham's tails were up and five minutes later Tom Cairney fed Ivan Cavaleiro, who got beyond Grant Hall but crashed his shot against the near post.</p>
      <p>Their pressure told in the 65th minute when Rangers goalkeeper Joe Lumley's poor clearance fell straight to the feet of Stefan Johansen.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian midfielder played the ball through to Kamara, who took a touch before beating Lumley inside the far post.</p>
      <p>QPR boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mark-warburton/"><b>Mark Warburton</b></a> said: "It's very frustrating to be leaving with nothing.</p>
      <p>"We know about the quality in the Fulham squad, but we had to be brave and you saw us being brave.</p>
      <p>"We got the early goal, created chances, matched a high-quality team in possession and been very, very good – but we've lost 2-1.</p>
      <p>"In that first period we could have been two or three up. Had we left with a point, I'd have been frustrated."</p>
