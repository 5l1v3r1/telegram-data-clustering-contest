      <h2>The Reds have never won the Premier League but are chasing their first domestic title since 1990 after opening up an early lead over their rivals at the top of the table</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> return to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/premier-league">Premier League</a> action eight points clear at the top of the table, still unbeaten, and short-priced favourites to land their first title in 30 years. </p>
      <p>After a dominant win over rivals Man City, there is an understandable optimism around Anfield that this really could be their year.</p>
      <p>But an apprehension remains among the clubs fans, who remember all too painfully the near misses of recent attempts.</p>
      <p>With another 26 matches to come, there still a very long way to go until the Reds can get close to any silverware.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp's</a> men seem in control as it stands, but he'll now more than anyone that fortunes can change in an instant.</p>

      <p>Here are five things Liverpool must do if they are to become champions in May...</p>
      <h3>1. Defend like last season</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Liverpool's seemingly impenetrable defence last season formed the backbone of their title charge.</p>
      <p>The Reds kept 21 clean sheets in total over the campaign, conceding only 22 goals all season.</p>
      <p>Compare that with the first 12 games of this season, they've kept the opposition out on just two occasions, shipping 10 goals in the process.</p>
      <p>While there is certainly no reason to panic (Liverpool are four points better off this term, with the same goal difference), Klopp may be slightly concerned.</p>
      <p>His side have snatched late goals against Aston Villa, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> , and Man Utd in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>And while with each dramatic finish they take a psychological step closer to the title, there is surely only so long they'll be able to keep notching last-minute winners.</p>
      <p>They've not looked as solid when Matip's been injured, while Alexander-Arnold's ability in attack is often good reason to ignore his minor weaknesses in defence.</p>
      <p>But now is the time to get back to what they were doing last season and not give other teams a sniff going forward.</p>
      <p>After all, defences win titles.</p>
      <h3>2. Avoid injuries</h3>

        <figcaption>Liverpool need their key players on the field<cite>(Image: PA)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Ok so this one is out of Liverpool's hands to an extent - but is still an important element.</p>
      <p>Providing Klopp doesn't overwork his players, they're only likely to be ruled out by something like a knock or unexpected strain - which are things they can't control.</p>
      <p>However it must be said that luck often plays a part in title run-ins.</p>
      <p>And Liverpool's strength in depth is still not ideal.</p>
      <p>An injury to van Dijk would threaten to de-rail their season in the same way that Aymeric Laporte's has for City, and Liverpool just aren't the same animal when one of their front three are missing.</p>
      <p>They've got players who can cover, but you can't replace players of that magnitude.</p>
      <p>Should injuries present themselves, the challenge then becomes how they deal with it.</p>
      <p>That said, squad players can often make a huge difference when called upon - such as Divock Origi's eye for goal at pivotal moments last season.</p>
      <p>The key will be to hope the starting XI steers clear of any problems, and for Klopp to ensure that anyone stepping in is ready and raring to go.</p>
      <h3>3. Let squad players contest the domestic cups</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The domestic cups aside, rotation isn’t a policy regularly undertaken by Jurgen Klopp. </p>
      <p>Very seldom does the Liverpool boss’s team selection take you by surprise, and he’s often a stickler for his best 11.</p>
      <p>It mattered little when they amassed 97 points and won the Champions League last season - and it's no different this time round.</p>
      <p>However they are already facing a heavy schedule, and with progression in the cups comes pressure to win things.</p>
      <p>Should Liverpool progress further in the FA and League Cups, fans will start thinking of silverware.</p>
      <p>But Liverpool’s second string is better than the majority of clubs, even in the top flight, and Klopp should, and most likely will, hand those cups over to the fringe players, and rest his big guns.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have bigger fish to fry this season, and the domestic cups should not become a distraction.</p>
      <h3>4. Cure the January blues</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>January has always proved a difficult month for Klopp<cite>(Image: Liverpool FC via Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It is stating the obvious to say Liverpool need to keep winning games to win the title - but that's become more important since last season than in previous years.</p>
      <p>Man City failed to win on just six occasions last season, to Liverpool's eight.</p>
      <p>Each point dropped is crucial to where the title will end up, and Liverpool's worst time of year is drawing closer.</p>
      <p>Last January was Klopp's best start to a year, but Liverpool still dropped four points - including three against City - and were eliminated from the FA Cup.</p>
      <p>It's a period which has troubled the Reds in the past under Klopp's tenure, and with a fixture pile-up at the back end of 2019, there is an increased risk of a post-festive season hangover.</p>
      <p>And they've not got a great run of games.</p>
      <p>They start the new year at home to high-flying Sheffield United, before going to Jose Mourinho's <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> , followed by a clash with rivals Man Utd at Anfield, and then head to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> .</p>
      <p>If they can emerge from that with a significant points gap in tact you'd fancy them to go all the way.</p>
      <p>But will the January blues affect them again?</p>
      <h3>5. Remain calm</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The end of last season saw one of the tensest battles for the title we've seen.</p>
      <p>Every week you expected one of City or Liverpool to slip up - but neither did.</p>
      <p>Both sides showed incredible relentlessness to grind out results, but for Liverpool, they face a fresh challenge this season.</p>
      <p>It's a different pressure being the chaser rather than the runaway leader, and the Reds will be frequently looking over their shoulder as the season continues.</p>
      <p>Not only that, but they've got Leicester and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> hot on their heels as well this year.</p>
      <p>They let a seven-point lead slip last season, and they must remain calm if they are to avoid a repeat.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>That includes Klopp, who must avoid any Kevin Keegan-esque meltdowns that can pile pressure on his players.</p>
      <p>And the Anfield crowd are not exempt.</p>
      <p>On occasions where Liverpool have been chasing a goal, you could cut the atmosphere with a knife inside their home stadium.</p>
      <p>Those instances have certainly become less frequent, as Anfield has become a fortress again, with the supporters as the 12th man.</p>
      <p>But it must continue.</p>
      <p>Stay calm, relax, and rise above the pressure - otherwise it will become a burden.</p>
