This has become the 3rd <b>100 crores</b> grosser movie of Ayushmann after <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/reviews/badhaai-ho-movie-review-it-breaks-a-taboo-making-you-laugh-the-whole-time/"><i>Badhaai Ho</i></a> &amp; <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/reviews/dream-girl-movie-review-laugh-out-loud-louder-loudest/"><i>Dream Girl</i></a> and also one of the fastest entries to the club.</p>
      <p>By collecting <b>100 crores</b> at the Box Office in just 15 days, <i>Bala</i> has become 68th fastest Bollywood movie to enter the <b>100 crores</b> club (including regional movies released in Hindi).</p>

      <p>With this feat, Bala has left behind movies like <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/reviews/son-of-sardaar-review/"><i>Son Of Sardaar</i></a> (16 Days), <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/reviews/stree-movie-review-a-ridiculously-true-phenomenon-entertainingly-told/"><i>Stree</i> </a>(16 Days), <i>Ghajini</i> (16+ Days), <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-news/after-abcd2-varun-dhawan-shraddha-kapoor-to-dance-on-the-beats-of-high-rated-gabru/"><i>ABCD2</i> </a>(17 Days), <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-news/barfi-movie-first-look-poster/"><i>Barfi</i> </a>(17 Days), <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/reviews/golmaal-3-review-by-komal-nahta/"><i>Golmaal 3</i> </a>(17 Days) and many more.</p>
      <p><i>Bala</i> has collected <b>100.15 crores</b> so far and should target atleast <b>120 crores</b> business lifetime going by its trend so far.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Yami Gautam who stars opposite Ayushmann in the film is on cloud nine and she gives credit for the success of the movie to writer and director.</p>
      <p><i>Bala</i> is Yami’s second <b>Rs 100 crore</b> movie of this year. Her film ‘<a href="https://www.koimoi.com/reviews/uri-the-surgical-strike-movie-review-a-war-movie-bollywood-can-boast-about/"><i>Uri: The Surgical Strike</i></a>‘, which was released in January this year, too hit a century at the box office.</p>
      <p>“It is the victory of writers and directors who are creating content that pushes boundaries. Every actor enjoys commercial success but in this case, I am happy that a film like <i>‘Bala’</i> is making it to the mark. It’s a validation of our choice of stories, assurance they we are doing work that’s resonating and I am genuinely excited to do more of such films. It is motivating me to go seek out more such films and create a better actor out of me,” Yami said.</p>
