      <p>Boston guard Kemba Walker was diagnosed with concussion-like symptoms and taken to a hospital for further evaluation after colliding with a teammate in the NBA.</p>
      <p>Walker and Semi Ojeleye collided late in the second quarter of Boston’s game against Denver, with Walker striking Ojeleye’s abdomen area head-first and going down on to the court in a heap.</p>
      <p>Play was stopped as medical personnel from both teams tended to the star guard, who was prone on the floor for several minutes. A brace was placed around his neck to stabilise the area and he was strapped to a backboard before being placed onto a gurney and wheeled off the court.</p>

      <p>Without their star point guard, Boston weren’t able to get the win and lost 96-92.</p>
      <p>Jamal Murray scored 22 points for Denver, including two clutch free throws with 1.5 seconds remaining, but his thoughts were with Walker after the game.</p>
      <p>‘‘That’s not something you want to mess around with,’’ Murray said. ‘‘Prayers out to him and hopefully he’s fine.’’</p>
