      <h1>Jose Mourinho's Premier League top four contract clause following Tottenham appointment</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho was named as Mauricio Pochettino's successor at Tottenham earlier this week. He will open his reign against West Ham in the Premier League on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:05:22+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:05</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho will pocket a £2million bonus if he can take <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> into next season's Champions League.</p>
      <p>Portuguese boss Mourinho returned to the Premier League after an 11 month absence this week when he was handed the reins at Spurs following Mauricio Pochettino's sacking at the north London club.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was handed a four-year contract at Spurs, which is worth £15m-a-year.</p>
      <p>But according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10397176/jose-mourinho-2million-bonus-tottenham-top-four/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballtwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574449073">the Sun,</a> Mourinho has a clause in his deal which will pay out an addition £2m if Spurs qualify for the top four - something they have done in each of the last four seasons.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss has an uphill task to earn the windfall as he takes over at Tottenham with the side 14th after 12 games.</p>

      <p>Under Pochettino, Spurs have won just three times this season and are 11 points adrift of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , who are currently fourth.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mourinho says Harry Kane needs to start winning trophies to go to the next level and wants to help him do it at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has a history of working with - and getting the best out of - top strikers.</p>

      <p>The 26-year-old England international's goal-scoring record is as good as it gets, but he has yet to win any silverware either for club or country.</p>
      <p>And Mourinho says he will not be considered among the world's best until he starts winning things.</p>
      <p>"He's one of the best strikers in the world," he said. "He's one of the best strikers in the world, no doubt, no doubt.</p>
      <p>"He just needs his team, with him, if his team is England or if his team is Tottenham, he just needs his team to bring him, or to go with him to the next level.</p>
      <p>"And what is the next level? Titles.</p>
      <p>"I think he needs to win, with us, with England, he needs to bring something to highlight the quality that he has as a player.</p>
      <p>"The goals he scores, what he brings to the team. Top striker. I've worked with some of the top ones."</p>
