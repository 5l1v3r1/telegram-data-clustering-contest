      <p>It comes to light that Aaron has been keeping secrets from his husband. The pair row and David storms out, deciding on a late night bike ride to clear his head. He’s angry and distracted, which means he doesn’t see the car bearing down on him until it’s too late – David is hit by the car and his life is slipping away. As he’s rushed to hospital he flatlines. Is he going to die??</p>
      <h3>2. Ned’s battle continues</h3>
      <p>After nearly battering his opponent to death, Ned has a wake up call. Aaron wants to know how the guy is but Ned stops him, begging him to keep his secret. In return, Aaron makes him promise he’ll never set foot in the ring again. But when Ned is triggered by a reminder of Scarlett he flips – is he losing his grip on himself?</p>
      <h3>3. Terese gets caught</h3>
      <p>Terese has so far managed to keep her fall off the wagon to herself, but when she has a moment of being complacent her world comes tumbling down. During a late night trip to the kitchen to find her wine bottle, Terese drinks to forget about her problems, not realising she is being watched – by Prue. Now she has the exact leverage she needs.</p>
      <h3>4. Harlow’s in danger</h3>

      <p>Prue makes it known she wants to take her daughter to London, but she faces fierce opposition. How lucky for her then to spy Terese necking alcohol on the sly. It’s the opportunity she needs and she begins blackmailing her, forcing Terese to do what she can to help to get Harlow to leave with her. Terese has no choice, and her actions make Harlow sway towards her mum. But no one realises exactly what Prue has in store for her offspring, will anyone realise the danger Harlow’s in before it’s too late?</p>

      <h3>4. Will Dipi cheat on Shane?</h3>
      <p>With the class action takes hold of Ramsay Street and still smarting from Kirsha’s departure, Dipi feels the distance between her and Shane widening. She offloads onto Gary, who can relate after losing Prue. When Shane goes to find her to apologise she’s nowhere to be seen. But then he learns that she is spending time with Gary and he is fuming. Is history repeating itself?</p>
      <h3>5. The class action escalates</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The class action is driving a wedge between the Ramsay Street locals, including Kyle and Amy. Amy is trying hard to keep them on track while he’s far too preoccupied. And things will only get worse when he learns Paul has tried to bribe Toadie into dropping the case – he sees red and guns it for Paul. Amy is stuck between her boyfriend and her dad, which way will she turn?</p>
      <h3>David takes a turn for the worse as the truth is revealed</h3>
      <p>David slowly comes round but his memory is hazy and he can’t remember who was driving the car that hit him. But when paint from his bike matches paint found on someone’s Ute, they discover who the culprit is – Kyle. The handyman is horrified and turns himself in to the police, and reveals the truth to David and Aaron. He accidentally fell asleep at the wheel. Paul is furious, but before he has time to act David suddenly takes a turn for the worst…</p>
