      <p>SOCORRO, Texas (KVIA/CNN) - A substitute teacher at a Texas high school was caught on camera telling a Spanish-speaking student to speak English.</p>
      <p>"Speak English. We're in America. Give me your phone."</p>
      <p>That was the moment a substitute teacher told a Socorro High School student to speak English in the middle of a busy classroom.</p>
      <p>The student in the video said students in the classroom were all using their phones, so he pulled his out to watch the Argentina vs. Uruguay match.</p>
      <p>The substitute then went over to him.</p>
      <p>"I saw that she was going to get it, so I got it too and I told her, 'No, why? ¿No, por que? And that’s when she said, ‘Talk English, we’re in America,’” said student Carlos Cobian.</p>
      <p>Several classmates were recording the incident.</p>
      <p>“I thought it was a little racist because you know, we live on the border and it's all Mexican, Latinos,” said Cobian.</p>
      <p>Cobian said he had never run into this before with any teacher, staff or substitute.</p>
      <p>“This is the first time, for me, it's the first time with someone being racist at Socorro High School,” Cobian said.</p>
      <p>Students are allowed to use phones with teacher permission, but Cobian said no other student was asked to hand over theirs.</p>
      <p>Cobian said the substitute then asked for security, who she reportedly told he had pushed her.</p>
      <p>He says he did not and when students shared video with security, the situation calmed down.</p>
      <p>Cobian was pulled out of class.</p>
      <p>The Socorro School District said: "The incident in the video is being investigated. Appropriate action, per our employee code of conduct policies, will be taken."</p>
      <p>This is the second incident at Socorro High School to be caught on cell phone video by students in the same week.</p>
      <p>Earlier, a teacher was seen on camera seemingly slapping a female student on her bottom. That educator is currently on paid administrative leave while the district investigates.</p>
