      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:11:51+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:11</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>A former flatmate of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/grace-millane">Grace Millane's</a> killer was so terrified of him that she slept with a knife, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>The claim emerged after the 27-year-old man was found guilty of murdering the British backpacker and burying her body in a suitcase.</p>
      <p>Miss Millane, from Wickford, Essex, was on a round-the-world trip when she was brutally killed by a Tinder date in Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
      <p>A woman who lived with the man said he was "troubled", drank "most nights", was a "prolific liar" and often brought women "straight into his bedroom" after meeting them on the dating app Tinder.</p>

      <p>The woman, who was not named, told <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/403947/millane-killer-so-scary-his-flatmate-went-to-bed-with-a-knife">Radio New Zealand</a> that none of the three flatmates - all women - wanted to be alone with him in the house.</p>
      <p>But one of them was alone with him one night, so she grabbed a knife for protection.</p>
      <p>She said: "My flatmate messaged me when she heard me arrive home and asked me to come into her room.</p>
      <p>"I went in and saw her and she had a knife in her bed. I asked what had happened.</p>

      <p>"She told me that (the man) had been drinking and that she felt uncomfortable around him."</p>
      <p>Eventually, the flatmates agreed it was time to tell him to move out, but they feared he would react angrily.</p>
      <p>He moved out - possibly after overhearing that conversation - but he later started messaging one of the women telling her he would ruin their lives.</p>
      <p>The former flatmate, who had moved to the UK by the time Miss Millane was murdered in December last year, said the man claimed his family was wealthy and ran restaurants in Australia.</p>

      <p>But she knew he was "full of s***" as he rented a $170-a-month (Â£85) room.</p>
      <p>The man moved into the house in Auckland suburb after he responded to a post in a Facebook group.</p>
      <p>His former flatmate said she was relieved after jurors convicted him on Friday following a two-week trial.</p>
      <p>She told how she felt sick for weeks when she first found out he was the suspect.</p>
      <p>She added: "When I found out it was him, I thought, oh right - he's the sort of person that could do that."</p>
      <p>Miss Millane spent several hours drinking in the centre of Auckland on December 1, 2018 - the day before her 22nd birthday - before she went to the killer's hotel room.</p>
      <p>The last time she was seen alive was in a lift with the man shortly before 10pm.</p>
      <p>She was killed either that night or in the early hours of the next morning.</p>
      <p>Her parents, David and Gillian, and several jurors wept as the unanimous verdict was announced.</p>
      <p>Outside court, Mr Millane said: "It will not reduce the pain and suffering we have had to endure over the past year.</p>
      <p>"Grace was taken in the most brutal fashion a year ago and our lives have been ripped apart.</p>
      <p>"Grace was our sunshine and she will be missed forever."</p>
      <p>Miss Millane's killer was remanded to custody until his sentencing on February 21, 2020.</p>
      <p>He faces life in prison with a minimum of 10 years without parole, though the judge can increase the latter period.</p>
