      <p>Doha: Aspetar, an orthopaedic &amp; sports medicine hospital, organised, on November 13, the second ‘Aspetar Clubs and Federations Conference-emergencies’ on the field, the conference focused on shoulder and ankle injuries as well as athlete’s collapse on the field. </p>
      <p>The event, hosted by Aspetar for the second time in row, aimed to provide a platform for educators, researchers, clinicians from across the country, to share experience and discuss the latest advancements, innovations and academic achievements in the fields of trauma, emergency and acute care medicine in sports and competitions.</p>
      <p>Continual medical education for all staff is a key priority to guarantee the best standard assessments and decision making in case of emergencies on the field. </p>
      <p>Commenting on the event, Dr Raouf Nader Rekik, conference’s scientific committee chairman, said, “The conference brought together a diverse group of experts and participants and facilitated the sharing of best practices regarding the management of different types of medical emergencies in the sport setting. It’s a unique gathering to deal with injuries and emergencies on the field. The objective of this conference is to help our medical staff guaranteeing the best outcome for our athletes when facing life-threatening conditions or injuries that could impact their future career.”</p>
      <p>The event brought recommendations based on the best available evidence in terms of assessing and managing shoulder and ankle injuries. It includes dislocations, fractures, ligament ruptures, etc. </p>
      <p>The second part focused on life-threatening conditions represented by collapses on the field, not only by cardiac arrest but also hyponatremia, anaphylaxis, heat exhaustion, etc. </p>
      <p>National Sports Medicine Programme, launched by Aspetar in 2009, is a unique initiative in the State of Qatar aimed at developing the quality of sports medicine services for all Qatari clubs and federations and benefiting all local athletes as well as international athletes competing in Qatar through an expert medical team consisting of doctors, physiotherapists, massage therapists and nurses. </p>
      <p>These medical teams are at the front line when dealing with acute injuries that could be sometimes life-threatening. They need to have the right skills and competences and be up to date on the latest best practice during such events. </p>
