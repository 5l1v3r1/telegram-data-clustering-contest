      <p>Nikola Jokic recorded a triple-double to help the Denver Nuggets overcome the Boston Celtics in a 96-92 victory at the Pepsi Center.</p>
      <p>However, the match was overshadowed by a neck injury sustained by Boston star Kemba Walker, who was taken to a local hospital with “with concussion-like symptoms” according to the team’s official Twitter account, before rejoining the Celtics on their journey back from Denver.</p>
      <p>Walker jolted his neck during a collision with team-mate Semi Ojeleye with 3.13 left in the second quarter but Boston could not stop falling to the third defeat in their last four games.</p>
