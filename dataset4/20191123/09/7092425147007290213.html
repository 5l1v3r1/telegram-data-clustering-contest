      <h3>Whenever her daughters are acting up, all Kristen has to do is get her kids to think of how the sisters in Frozen would handle conflict</h3>
      <p>Kristen Bell has revealed a handy trick on how she breaks up arguments between her daughters Delta, 4, and Lincoln, 6.</p>
      <p>The actress, who voices Princess Anna in both Frozen and Frozen 2, told People she gets her kids to think about sisters Anna and Elsa when they are arguing.</p>
      <p>Lucky for Bell, both Delta and Lincoln are big big fans of Frozen, and, because Bell is directly involved in the films she has leverage.</p>
      <p>Speaking to People, the 39-year-old actress said:</p>
      <p>“I will go like, ‘Well, Elsa would have never said that to Anna,'"</p>
      <p>"Literally! I’ll go, ‘What do you think Anna and Elsa would do about wanting to share this toy?'.</p>
      <p>“That’s the power of story, right?” said Bell. “They respect this story so much and they know this narrative and they know these girls care, so it’s an easy way to pop them out of their anger and think about being kind for a second.”</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, her daughters favourite character is not Anna. Instead, it's Elsa, voiced by Idina Menzel.</p>
      <p>According to Bell, her kids were not overly swayed by Frozen when they first watched it. Eventually though, the pair became hooked like the masses.</p>
      <p>“When they first saw 'Frozen' they liked it, but didn’t love it. And I find that so funny because I think it’s in your DNA to reject your parents.</p>
      <p>"So they like it very much and they do sometimes dress as the characters, but I think that’s also because it’s culturally sort of a phenomenon. Like their friends dress as the characters. But it’s funny now more recently they’ve gotten more into it," concluded Bell.</p>
