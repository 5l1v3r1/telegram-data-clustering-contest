      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/myles-stephenson/">Myles Stephenson</a>’s ex Gabby Allen is thought to have been ‘bombarded’ with claims of his cheating, following his stint in the I’m A Celebrity jungle.</p>
      <p>The pair dated for 11 months before splitting earlier this year, amid claims the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a> winner, 28, was unfaithful – something he fiercely denied.</p>
      <p>It has now been claimed the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a> favourite has been sent messages and proof of his infidelity, including ‘sexts and explicit pictures’.</p>
      <p>‘A barrage of women have stepped forward since Myles appeared on I’m A Celeb, she has been bombarded,’ an insider said.</p>
      <p>‘They have been sending proof of the messages, sext and d**k pics Myles sent to them when he was with Gabby.’</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/gabby-allen-bombarded-women-claiming-20939689">The source also told the Mirror</a> that Gabby was informed Myles had been ‘two-timing’ her throughout their relationship, with an unnamed woman reportedly claiming she had also been seeing the ITV star ‘the entire time’.</p>

      <p>Myles has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/im-celebrity-myles-stephenson-sets-record-straight-claims-cheated-ex-gabby-allen-11204906/">previously addressed accusations that he cheated</a> on the 27-year-old after he was caught messaging his ex-girlfriend.</p>

      <p>But he insisted they weren’t together at the time, and that ‘nothing happened’ with his ex.</p>
      <p>‘We were on a break at the time when I messaged this girl, a previous ex,’ he told the Sun.</p>
      <p>‘I shouldn’t have done it, even though me and Gabby weren’t speaking at the time and I moved home, but it was a general conversation.</p>
      <p>‘It was a stupid mistake and I stopped speaking to her when we started getting back together, but by that time she’s messaged Gabby and said we’d been speaking.’</p>

      <p>Viewers recently saw the Rak-Su singer opening up about his love life to campmates Ian Wright and Roman Kemp, admitting that he wanted to find something a bit more ‘meaningful’.</p>
      <p>And, despite Gabby being abroad in Thailand, she couldn’t help but react to his words on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Taking aim at the I’m Feeling You singer, she wrote: ‘Apparently he was on about “meaningful relationships”. I’m not sure the guy knows what he’s on about tbh.</p>
      <p>‘I didn’t know cheating, lying and a whole load of other [poo emoji] came under “meaningful”. Who knows? Each to their own?’</p>
