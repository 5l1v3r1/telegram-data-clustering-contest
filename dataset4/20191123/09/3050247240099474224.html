      <h1>Bakkt Bitcoin Futures Set New Daily Record Trading Over $20M</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:14:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:14</time> by <a rel="author">Adrian Zmudzinski</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) futures daily volumes on digital asset platform Bakkt have hit a new all-time high, <a href="https://www.theice.com/products/72035464/Bakkt-Bitcoin-USD-Monthly-Futures/data?marketId=6137543">according</a> to data from Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). More than $20.3 million was traded in Bitcoin — or 2728 futures contracts — on Nov. 22. </p>
      <h3>30% higher than the previous daily volume record</h3>
      <p>The new volume record represents a 66% increase over the previous day and is roughly 30% higher than the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bakkt-bitcoin-futures-trading-volume-just-hit-another-all-time-high">previous all-time high</a> on Nov. 8. </p>

      <h3>Major price moves coincide with big volume</h3>
      <p>Additionally, yesterday’s open interest is currently $1.75 million, a 29% increase over the previous trading day. Despite a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/first-week-of-bakkt-slow-start-unlikely-to-dampen-long-term-prospects">slow start</a> upon launch in September, the volumes of Bakkt’s physically settled BTC futures have been gradually increasing.</p>
      <p>The new record volume also coincides with a significant drop in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/friday-shows-bloodbath-for-crypto-markets-bitcoin-price-at-7-300">Bitcoin price</a>, which fell below $7,000 on Friday. Previous upticks in volumes have also aligned with major BTC price moves as seen <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-soars-42-to-10-500-biggest-daily-gain-since-2011">around Oct. 25</a> and Nov. 8. </p>
      <p>According to ICE — the operator of 23 leading global exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange — the last reported Bakkt contract trading price on Friday was $7,240.</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bullish-bakkt-company-launches-new-products-as-futures-trading-surges">reported</a>, Bakkt is expanding its line of Bitcoin-related products as institutional interest appears to be growing. </p>
      <p>The digital asset platform <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ice-officially-confirms-dec-9-launch-of-cash-settled-bitcoin-futures">confirmed</a> earlier this week that cash-settled Bitcoin futures contracts will be offered on ICE Futures Singapore as of Dec. 9. The <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-bakkt-announces-first-regulated-options-contract-for-bitcoin">first regulated options</a> contract for Bitcoin is also expected to launch on the same date.</p>
