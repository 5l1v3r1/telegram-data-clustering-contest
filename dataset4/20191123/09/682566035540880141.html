      <p>Cape Town - Proteas skipper <b>Faf du Plessis</b> believes that more one-day cricket should be played in Paarl after witnessing first-hand the massive support assemble at Boland Park in the ongoing <b>Mzansi Super League</b> (MSL).</p>
      <p>Friday evening's T20 game saw just under 5 000 flood the gates of Boland Park as the <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Cricket/MzansiSuperLeague/defending-champion-jozi-stars-slip-to-fifth-msl-defeat-in-a-row-20191122">Paarl Rocks defeated</a> defending champions Jozi Stars.</p>
      <p>The Paarl Rocks skipper commented on the dismal attendance figures thus far in the tournament.</p>
      <p>"The competition is not producing a lot of big crowds, we are so grateful for the people in Paarl, I know they're hungry for cricket," Du Plessis told reporters following the match.</p>
      <p>"It's not easy coming to watch every game of cricket, it takes a bit of effort and you can watch it on TV but we've really got some passionate fans."</p>
      <p>The capacity at Boland Park during the MSL is <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Cricket/MzansiSuperLeague/paarl-helps-breathe-new-life-into-desperate-msl-20191118">reportedly only 6 500</a>, so <b>4 850</b> that showed up on Friday created a 'close to full' atmosphere. </p>
      <p>Du Plessis admitted that although the stadium is not entirely 'ready' to host Test cricket, he firmly believes that more one-day cricket should be played in Paarl.</p>
      <p>"It's not impossible, it's proven with one-day cricket the ground staff do a good job, good wickets... (They're) probably not there yet in terms of other grounds in the country and the capacity," said Du Plessis.</p>
      <p>"But what's happening over the last two years in Boland cricket, you can see how big this is and a step in the right direction.</p>
      <p>"Now it's easy for me to suggest that more one-day cricket should be played in Boland because it's a good venue, has good facilities and very passionate people," he said.</p>
      <p>"As South African players you want to go where there is support so if you get a ground like Paarl then of cause you want to take your cricket there."</p>
      <p>Despite missing out on a bonus-point win on Friday, the Paarl Rocks currently sit third with 11 points on the <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Cricket/MzansiSuperLeague/Logs">MSL standings</a>.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, it's the much-anticipated Cape derby, which sees the Cape Town Blitz host the Rocks at Newlands.</p>
      <p>Play gets underway at <b>10:00</b>.</p>
