      <p>Roy Cropper (David Neilson) hasn’t long lost his mother Sylvia and he is about to face further tragedy when another family member dies – just days after they meet. The Coronation Street cafe owner has discovered that he actually has a long lost brother as a result of an affair Sylvia had – and they meet through playing online Scrabble together.</p>
      <p>Roy is keen to get to know Richard and the pair end up having a lot in common – including a shared enthusiasm for steam trains. But the joy is short lived as Richard’s daughter Nina has been forced to make it clear to Roy that Richard is terminally ill and doesn’t have long left.</p>
      <p>That said, Richard is determined to make the most of the opportunity to get to know Roy and heads to Weatherfield to visit, despite Nina worrying about his ailing state. As his carer, Nina is all that Richard has and vice versa – so she is harbouring some resentment to Roy as she feels the excitement and the exertion aren’t good for her dad.</p>

      <p>As they visit Roy at the cafe, Roy offers to help them both as much as possible and be there for them but Nina is reluctant to accept his help. Roy later visits them and is horrified to see how frail Richard looks as he continues to deteriorate.</p>

      <p>Nina blames Roy for Richard’s setback and he is overwhelmed by guilt and later, he admits to Carla Connor (Alison King) that he has made a huge decision – he will take Nina in and look after her after Richard’s death.</p>
      <p>Roy returns to the flat and offers to help Nina move an air condenser but she is still adamant she can handle everything alone and injures herself in the process. As Roy gets the opportunity to step in and care for Richard, he realises the toll that it is taking on Nina and he takes it upon himself to call adult social services, leaving Nina furious.</p>

      <p>As Roy’s interference with Richard’s carer leads to them quitting their job, Nina tells Roy he has made everythign worse but he is not giving up and decides he must spend more time with them so offers Aggie more shifts at the cafe.</p>
      <p>As Roy makes it clear he is taking over Richard’s primary care, will stubborn Nina submit and accept his help?</p>
