        <i>Retailer claims decision on ‘war cloud’ system is political and is contesting it in US federal court</i>
      </p>
      <p>Amazon has filed a lawsuit contesting the US defence department’s decision to award a Pentagon cloud computing contract worth up to $10bn (£7.8bn) to rival bidder <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/microsoft">Microsoft</a>.</p>
      <p>The complaint and supplemental motion for discovery were filed in the US court of federal claims under seal, according to a spokesman for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon">Amazon</a> Web Services, a division of the online retail giant founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos.</p>
      <p>The company did not explain the basis for its complaint.</p>
      <p>The filings contain “proprietary information, trade secrets and confidential financial information” that could “cause either party severe competitive harm”, Amazon said in a court document seeking a protective order.</p>
      <p>“The record in this bid protest likely will contain similarly sensitive information,” it said.</p>
      <p>Last week, the US defence secretary, Mark Esper, rejected any suggestion of bias in the Pentagon’s decision to award Microsoft the contract after Amazon announced plans to challenge it.</p>
      <p>“We believe the facts will show they [Department of Defense] ran a detailed, thorough and fair process in determining the needs of the warfighter were best met by Microsoft,” Microsoft said.</p>
      <p>Amazon had been considered a favourite for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (Jedi) cloud contract, part of a broader digital modernisation project at the Pentagon, before software developer Microsoft <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/oct/26/pentagon-awards-10bn-cloud-computing-deal-to-microsoft-snubbing-amazon">emerged as the surprise winner</a>.</p>
      <p>Amazon has previously said that politics got in the way of a fair bidding process. Bezos, the chief executive officer of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post, has been an outspoken critic of Donald Trump.</p>
