      <h2>They failed to mention the 'rock, paper, scissor' decider</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:59:10+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:59</time> by <a rel="author">Natasha Rigler</a></address>
      <p>TV bosses have been slammed by fans after keeping the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-ian-wright-gets-grumpy-over-jac-and-myles-trial/">Main Camp</a> in the dark over the results of the latest <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> task.</p>
      <p>Viewers watched on Friday night as Jacqueline Jossa and Myles Stephenson successfully won six stars during a <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">Bushtucker trial</a>, which saw them come face-to-face with dozens of snakes.</p>

      <p>But after being told they could either send the meals to the main camp, or take them with them to the Jail House, the pair decided the fairest way to decide would be with a game of 'rock, paper, scissors'.</p>
      <p>As a result, the Jail House - where Jacqueline and Myles are now staying - were treated to the camel meat dinners while the Main Camp missed out.</p>
      <p>However, producers only told the Main Camp half the story in a letter - that Jacqueline and Myles decided to take the meals with them.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The 'rock, paper, scissors' part was left out, meaning the likes of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-ian-wright-gets-grumpy-over-jac-and-myles-trial/">campmate Ian Wright felt they had made a selfish decision</a>.</p>
      <p>He moaned: "That's just going to put me in the wrong vibe all day now."</p>
      <p>Viewers have now blasted ITV bosses for not explaining the full story.</p>

      <p>One fan tweeted: "I mean they could of at least said on the letter that the decision of where the food was going was made by a game of rock, paper, scissors and then Jacqueline and Myles would be changing camps #ImACeleb."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Well done @jacquelineMjos and @MylesRakSu in Snake Hotel. They chose to use rock/paper/scissors on which camp gets the food however the show didn't tell main camp thats how they chose.</p>

      <p>"Is the show trying cause conflict or what?"</p>
      <p>A third even said: "You aren't going to tell them about the rock paper scissors? What [bleep] stirrers the producers are. #ImACeleb."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there were dramatic scenes in the Jail House once Jacqueline, Myles and their campmates had received their dinner.</p>

      <p>Irish comedian <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-andrew-maxwell-almost-choked-on-camel-during-trial/">Andrew Maxwell began choking on the camel meat</a> bosses had sent them, with Kate Garraway and Adam Whymet having to slap him on the back.</p>
      <p>Once he had coughed it up, Myles told Andrew: "Chew your food, mate, you scared us."</p>
