      <p>O’Plérou Grebet, a 21-year-old graphic design student from Ivory Coast has produced an impressive amount of more than 200 emoji. These represent objects, symbols, food, clothing and much more that identifies African culture. Although created as a way for Africans to “communicate more accurately using instant messaging,” the emoji are also designed for non-Africans so they can discover a new culture with a modern and innovative approach.<br/><br/>SOURCE: <a href="https://www.collater.al/en/oplerou-grebet-african-culture-arrives-on-emoji-graphic-design/">COLLATER.AL</a></p>

      <p>Namibia’s landscapes are epic, both in terms of sheer scale and natural beauty. the Namib Desert, which gave the country its name, is more than just a huge sandbox – it’s also tortured mountains and rocky canyons. These captivating environments are ripe for explorations on foot or mountain bike. And soaring inselbergs such as Spitzkoppe are great places to cling to if you have a penchant for rock climbing. Flanking the entire country’s west, running almost 1600km from South Africa to Angola, is a wild coastline with a history for sinking ships.<br/><br/>SOURCE: <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/desert-playground-namibias-wildest-activities">LONELY PLANET</a></p>

      <p>A safari vacation in Africa is probably the most organized vacation you’ll ever take. While it is possible to simply fly to a few places — Arusha, Tanzania, or Maun, Botswana — and rent a car to take off into the countryside, few people want to risk being alone on unmarked dirt roads patrolled by hyenas, cheetahs and lions. To get the food, shelter and safari experience you want, you need to research your trip.<br/><br/>SOURCE: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/travel/safaris-for-beginners.html">THE NEW YORK TIMES</a></p>

      <p>The “uhuru railway” is an epic 1,860km 52-hour train ride on board the Tazara line from Tanzania’s commercial capital Dar es Salaam into Kapiri Mposhi in the heart of Zambia’s copper belt. The Tazara station in Dar es Salaam is a beautiful masterpiece of 1970s Communist modernist architecture with a central staircase running through the enormous cathedral-sized hall. With airy huge windows, neatly arranged seating areas, faded lime green walls and general decay, it transports you back to train travel of a bygone era.<br/><br/>SOURCE: <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-50420129">BBC</a></p>

      <p>The Dunes Electroniques music festival marked a joyous and noisy comeback after a three-year silence following several deadly attacks in the North African country which also badly hit its tourism sector. In a sign of the growing appeal of the remote Saharan region and its other-worldly landscapes, more than 20 international and local DJs and thousands of revellers converged on the desert site of Ong Jmal in southwest Tunisia for the two-day extravaganza. A Saharan ultra-marathon, the Tozeur International Film Festival and a Sufi music festival called Rouhaniyet have all been launched. Hotels are more often fully booked and tourists are starting to stay a little longer.<br/><br/>SOURCE: <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/desert-dunes-electro-fans-rave-tunisia-tourism-191119070654993.html">AL JAZEERA</a></p>
