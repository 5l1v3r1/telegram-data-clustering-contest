      <p>MUMBAI: <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/NCP">NCP</a> president <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Sharad-Pawar">Sharad Pawar</a> on Saturday said the decision of his nephew <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ajit-Pawar">Ajit Pawar</a> to join hands with the BJP to form a government in Maharashtra was an act of indiscipline and attracts provisions of anti-defection law.</p>
      <p>Pawar was addressing a joint press conference with <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Shiv-Sena">Shiv Sena</a> chief Uddhav Thackeray here.</p>
      <p>"Ajit Pawar's decision is an act of indiscipline. No NCP worker is in favour of the NCP-BJP government. NCP MLAs who support the BJP should know this move attracts provisions of anti-defection law," he said.</p>
      <p>Whenever elections are held in the constituencies of these legislators, Congress-NCP and Shiv Sena would unitedly defeat them, he added.</p>
      <p>He said 54 newly-elected legislators of the NCP had signed a paper along with their names and constituencies for internal purpose and these signatures may have been misused as letter of support and submitted to the governor.</p>
      <p>"If this is true, the governor has also been misled," Pawar said, adding that the paper may have been taken by Ajit Pawar as the leader of the legislature party.</p>
      <p>He said those MLAs, who were taken to the Raj Bhavan for oath-taking without their knowledge, have contacted him and informed how they were misled.</p>
      <p>Three such legislators, including Rajendra Shingane from Buldhana and Sandeep Kshirsagar from Beed, were present at the press conference.</p>
      <p>They said they were called to party leader Dhananjay Munde's house at 7 am and from there were taken in a car to Raj Bhavan.</p>
      <p>Pawar said no action would be taken against those who unknowingly went to Raj bhavan for the swearing-in and were back in the party fold.</p>
      <p>NCP legislature party meeting would be held later in the day to elect the new leader.</p>
      <p>On the issue of action against Ajit Pawar, the former Union minister said a decision to that effect would be taken by the disciplinary committee.</p>
      <p>Uddhav Thackeray said, "Earlier the EVM khel (game) was going on and now this is new khel. From here onwards I don't think elections are even needed."</p>
      <p>"Everyone knows what Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj did when betrayed and attacked from the back," he said, adding that Sena workers will foil all attempts to poach party MLAs.</p>
