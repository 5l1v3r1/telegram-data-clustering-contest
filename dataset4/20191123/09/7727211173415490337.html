      <p>A mysterious note left in a Tesco handbag has stunned a shopper after she discovered the random act of kindness.</p>
      <p>Clare Smith said she had visited her local branch of Tesco, in Hucknall, and said she was left "shocked" at what she found inside.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old said: "I went to the store on Thursday and picked out the handbag which was the only one, and it was right at the back of a rack.</p>
      <p>"I'd been looking for a new bag and not seen one I liked but this one stood out.</p>
      <p>"When I got it home, I was removing the packaging and putting my belongings in, and in a zipped pocket was an envelope.</p>
      <p>"Inside was the note and the money. It really shocked me."</p>

      <p>The note said, "all your dreams are possible, go for it, have faith in yourself," accompanied by a £5 note, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/hucknall-woman-finds-inspiring-note-3567206">Nottinghamshire Live</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Clare, who works in private cleaning, said she is deciding how she can use the money for a positive cause.</p>

      <p>"It really wasn't the money that got me though, but more the note. I've got it pinned up now.</p>
      <p>"I want to do something of a similar with the £5 rather than spend it.</p>
      <p>"I'd love to know who it was - I've since been told similar things have happened before in Hucknall. It's such a nice thing to do.</p>
      <p>"It really perked my day up and I'd like to do the same for someone else."</p>
      <p>Hucknall Extra store manager Sam Johnson said: "This is a lovely gesture from someone spreading kindness and we’re really happy they brightened Clare’s day."</p>
