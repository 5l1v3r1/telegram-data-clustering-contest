        <b>Naomi Campbell has proven she’s as obsessed with BTS as the rest of us, dubbing their makeup line ‘fantastic’.</b>
      </p>
      <p>No lies detected.</p>
      <p>The supermodel, who sent everyone into meltdown by collaborating with YouTube beauty guru Jackie Aina for a girls’ night in, gave a little shoutout to the K-Pop heroes.</p>
      <p>Showing off a powder product that’s marketed to men, she said: ‘You know, men are coming up with makeup now. BTS have a whole makeup line. Yeah they do.’</p>

      <p>Sensing the arrival of ARMYs, Jackie said: ‘Uh oh. BTS ARMY. They’re going to ignite in the comments now you’ve acknowledged them.’</p>
      <p>‘I think it’s fantastic,’ Naomi added. ‘I’ve seen it. And so men’s makeup, I think, is going to be huge. It’s on its way.’</p>
      <p>Naturally, fans couldn’t hold back their excitement.</p>

      <p>‘It’s the way she mentions @BTS_twt so casually, with the assumption that others will obviously already know who they are, that makes this so great,’ one wrote.</p>
      <p>Another pointed out: ‘Naomi campbell talking about bts …. more specifically bts in makeup like WHO is doing it like bts do WHO.’</p>
      <p>‘PAUSE NAOMI CAMPBELL???? LIKE THE NAOMI CAMPBELL??? TALKING ABOUT BTS??#*#&gt;[×&lt;&gt;÷ HOLD ON I NEED A MOMENT PLS,’ one more excited fan added.</p>
      <p>Despite evidently slaying the makeup world, the boys – RM, Suga, V, Jin, Jungkook, J-Hope and Jimin – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/bts-working-hard-new-music-right-now-keep-army-well-fed-11185300/">have explained they’re focused on their music right now.</a></p>

      <p>Although they’ve been enjoying a break, they’re already cooking up some new hits for fans, proving that the hustle never stops.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>In an interview <a href="https://www.papermag.com/break-the-internet-bts-2641354203.html?rebelltitem=57#rebelltitem57">with Paper magazine</a>, the group revealed: ‘We are currently practicing and working on new songs so we can show you the best sides of ourselves. Please look forward to it.’</p>
      <p>We are, don’t worry about that!</p>
      <p>Meanwhile rapper <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/bts-star-rm-admits-feels-pressure-perfect-part-life-11183754/">RM confessed that he does feel ‘pressure’ to maintain an image</a> for their followers, but his fellow member Suga added that ‘pressure is also one part of life’. J-Hope added: ‘I can’t say we don’t [feel pressure]. These days, I feel like I live with a sense of mission.</p>
      <p>‘Rather than thinking, “It has to be perfect!,” I do what I have to do, making sure I remember the really important and fundamental things and trust that the results will follow.’</p>
      <p>Sounds like words to stand by.</p>
