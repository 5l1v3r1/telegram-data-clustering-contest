      <p>California had been “dry” since July 1 of 1919, and this caused a big adjustment for local vintners, even out on the Channel Islands where wine had been produced since the late 1800s. </p>
      <p>“The long-established wineries of Santa Cruz Island, 30 miles off the coast of this city, probably will be dismantled … and the vats, casks, and other equipment sold to South American companies.” [Spoiler alert – the entire United States would go dry in January, 1920.]</p>
      <p>“There is on the island, one of the best collections of old handmade and hand-carved Spanish casks … The island’s present store of wine is being shipped to Japan.” The winery was not used again, and is currently being converted into a museum.</p>
