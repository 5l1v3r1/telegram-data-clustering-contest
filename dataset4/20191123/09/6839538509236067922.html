      <p>A British tourist who was camping in Victoria remains missing almost a day after suffering a medical condition, hitting his head and fleeing into bushland.</p>
      <p>Aslan King, 25, was camping with friends at Princetown, near the Twelve Apostles, when he hit his head about 2am on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He ran into the bush and his friends were unable to find him.</p>
      <p>Local police, search and rescue officers, a police helicopter, Parks Victoria officials and State Emergency Services volunteers tried to find him on Saturday with no success.</p>
      <p>The search will be scaled back overnight, before resuming in earnest on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>Mr King has a medium build with short hair and was wearing trackpants, a light grey T-shirt and hoodie with green Reebok sneakers when he fled.</p>
      <p>He may possibly have blood on his forehead.</p>
