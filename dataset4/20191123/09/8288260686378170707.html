      <p>Two people have been left hospitalised after they were cut free from a car following an early morning smash.</p>
      <p>Emergency services raced to the scene on Mount Pleasant, Bilston, at around 4.33am, this morning (Saturday, November 23).</p>
      <p>The fire service had to fully remove the roof of a car in order to rescue the trapped casualties who were trapped by their injuries.</p>
      <p>It is unclear what injuries they have sustained from the crash.</p>
      <p>The fire service took to Twitter to warn others about the incident. The tweet said: " <a href="https://twitter.com/WestMidsFire">@WestMidsFire</a> are in attendance at a two car road traffic collision in Bilston. Two people trapped by injuries. Police, ambulance and fire service in attendance."</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for West Midlands Fire Service told <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theblackcountrylive/">Black Country Live</a> it involved two cars and two people were taken to hospital following a full roof removal. The service then made the cars safe.</p>
