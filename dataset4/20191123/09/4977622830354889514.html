      <p>Member of Parliament (MP) from Wayanad in Kerala, senior leader of the Congress party Rahul Gandhi has not attended a single day of the ongoing Winter Session of the Parliament since its commencement on 18 November, <a href="https://www.aninews.in/news/national/general-news/5-days-into-parliaments-winter-session-rahul-gandhi-continues-to-be-absent20191122212630/">reports </a><i>Asian News International (ANI).</i></p>
      <p>Raising questions about former Congress party president's continuous absence in the Lok Sabha, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Jagdambika Pal stressed that the "attitude of these young leaders is very disappointing."</p>
      <p>Asserting that even older leaders are regularly present in the House and active in respective constituencies as well, Pal stressed, "The public elects and sends us to Parliament, so we raise their issues in the House and find some solutions."</p>
      <p>It should be noted that the Parliament, since the beginning of the Winter Session has taken up discussions and debates on a number of important subjects including air pollution woes in National Capital Region (NCR), situation in Jammu and Kashmir (J&amp;K) and the usage of electoral bonds, et cetera.</p>
