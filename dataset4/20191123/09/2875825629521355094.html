      <p>Kimberley Walsh made sure she celebrated her 38th birthday in style by swigging vodka, wild dancing and noshing down a very creamy birthday cake.</p>
      <p>Pop princess turned musical theatre star Kimberley made sure she invited ex Girls Aloud bandmates and best pals Cheryl and Nicola Roberts.</p>
      <p>Awkwardly, Kimberley's birthday bash fell on the evening a wild rumour flooded the internet, claiming the three Girls Aloud stars connived to set up a Whats App group plotting Nadine Coyle's downfall on I'm A Celebrity.</p>

      <p>Although the reports were denied in a rare joint statement from Cheryl, Nicola and Kimberley the details of the alleged plot were so embarrassing they must have played on their mind during the wild bash.</p>
      <p>The most inflammatory false accusation involved the trio, who admitted they haven't spoken to Nadine since the group split, plotting to get their former pal to eat Turkey testicles.</p>

      <p>But ignoring the cringe slurs the trio made sure Kimberley had the time of her life at the bash in Bagatelle in Mayfair.</p>
      <p>Cheryl shared a video of Kimberley swigging from a giant bottle of vodka and abandoning her sky high silver stilletos.</p>
      <p>Nicola was spotted dancing in her sassy bralet and knee-length tailored skirt as Cheryl posed up for snaps.</p>

      <p>In a statement to MailOnline Cheryl said: "We only want to see Nadine do well, and regardless of any differences we might have had, we will always all have love for each other.</p>
      <p>"We did not enjoy watching her distressed when jumping out of the plane. And we don’t have time for group chats regarding the trials on the show!"</p>
      <p>Kimberley also dismissed the claim and that when Nadine jumped from the helicopter in the launch episode, her heart went out to her.</p>

      <p>She said: "I felt really emotional watching Nadine jump out of the plane and texted Cheryl saying how hard it was to watch. I think she’s doing great in there."</p>
      <p>This was echoed by Nicola Roberts, who also slammed the reports that the Girls Aloud singers were hoping for bad things to happen to Nadine in the Australian jungle.</p>
      <p>She also dismissed reports that there was a private group chat where they tear into Nadine behind her back.</p>
      <p>Nicola said: 'We don’t have a group chat about I’m A Celebrity, this just isn’t true. We only wish Nadine the best in the jungle and hope she does well on the show.'</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the band also said the reports were "fabricated", telling MailOnline: "This story is completely fabricated and made up.</p>

      <p>"Cheryl, Nicola and Kimberley have not been 'plotting' to get Nadine to do trials in I’m A Celebrity. To suggest they have been is quite frankly ridiculous."</p>
      <p>There had been rumours that Nadine and Cheryl had a longstanding disagreement but Nadine denied this when asked about by Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
