      <h2>The GP surgery will NOT be reopening on Monday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Dowrick</a></address>
      <p>A Plymouth GP surgery has been permanently shut down after an inspection by the health watchdog raised 'serious concerns' over patient care.</p>
      <p>Barton Surgery in Plymstock <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/barton-surgery-shut-down-after-3480186">closed its doors last month for four weeks,</a> with patients reportedly turned away by NHS staff.</p>
      <p>While the surgery was expected to reopen on Monday, November 25, the Clinical Commissioning Group which commissions the surgery has told Plymouth Live that the surgery will not be reopening.</p>
      <p>Now, Plymouth Live can confirm the surgery will be closing permanently.</p>
      <p>Plymouth Live understands that staff were told of the surgery's closure during a staff meeting on November 20.</p>
      <p>The surgery's contract had been 'handed back to to the CCG [Clinical Commissioning Group] and the surgery will permanently close next month.</p>
      <p>A source said: "At a staff meeting on Wednesday, staff were told the contract had been handed back to the CCG and the surgery will finish being a surgery on December 31."</p>
      <p>"The doors will not be reopening [on Monday, November 25].</p>
      <p>The closure has been confirmed by NHS Devon CCG.</p>
      <p>Mark Procter, director of Primary Care at NHS Devon Clinical Commissioning Group, said: "Barton Surgery in Plymstock will no longer be providing GP services with immediate effect.  This follows a temporary suspension put in place by the Care Quality Commission on October 28.</p>
      <p>"The CQC reported that as a result of serious concerns found by inspectors at the practice, they had put in place a temporary suspension for a period of four weeks.</p>
      <p>"During this time the contract holder for the practice has taken the decision to cease providing GP services at Barton Surgery. This means that Barton Surgery will not re-open.</p>
      <p>"Registered patients have been sent information advising them to register with a new GP practice, and contact details for local practices are included.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Advice for patients - from NHS Devon Clinical Commissioning Group</b>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>To enable you to continue to access GP services it is important that you register with a new GP practice as soon as possible</li>
        <li>If you have repeat prescriptions, and you have a recent repeat prescription counterfoil, please also bring this with you when registering at your new surgery.</li>
        <li>You do have the option to register with any practice of your choice with an open list, provided you live within their practice boundary (please note, Church View Surgery and Dean Cross Surgery are currently closed to new patients).  You can find your nearest GP practice on <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/">www.nhs.uk</a> under ‘Find a GP’.  You will need to check with the practice that you live within their boundary</li>
        <li>If your supply of medication is due to run out in the next 7 days, an urgent prescription can be arranged at Barton Surgery between Monday 25 November and Friday 29 November. Please visit the practice and bring in your repeat prescription counterfoil. Community pharmacies in the local area can make emergency supplies of most medicines, if required.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The news comes after the surgery was closed down in October for four weeks after inspectors from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) had 'serious concerns' and the commission had to take 'urgent enforcement action' in order to protect patients at the surgery.</p>
      <p>The surgery was expected to reopen on Monday, November 25.</p>
      <p>Director of Primary Care at NHS Devon Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) which commissions the surgery, Mr Mark Procter said last month: "We have been informed by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) of the results of an unannounced inspection at Barton Surgery, Plymstock in Plymouth on Thursday October 24.</p>
      <p>"The CQC is the independent regulator of health and adult social care in England, including GP practices. </p>
      <p>"The CQC reported that as a result of serious concerns found by inspectors at the practice, they have taken urgent enforcement action to protect patients who use it.</p>
      <p>"They have also put in place a temporary suspension at Barton Surgery from Monday October, 28 2019 until November, 25 2019."</p>
