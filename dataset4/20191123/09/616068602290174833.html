      <p>A freezing rain warning remains in effect for much of the Okanagan, while heavy snow is expected at some higher elevation areas of the Southern Interior.</p>
      <p>Saturday morning, Environment Canada continued its special weather statement for the Central and North Okanagan, warning of freezing rain.</p>
      <p>“Surfaces such as highways, road, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery,” the warning states. “Take extra caution when walking or driving in affected areas.”</p>
      <p>Flurries and freezing rain are also forecast for the Okanagan Connector, the Coquihalla Highway, from Hope to Kamloops, and Highway 3 through Allison Pass.</p>
      <p>A similar warning was <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/BC/271086/wet-snow-freezing-rain">issued Friday afternoon</a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, 20 to 25 centimetres of snow are forecast to fall on the Trans-Canada Highway around Revelstoke, between Eagle Pass and Rogers Pass. The snow is expected to continue through to Sunday morning.</p>
