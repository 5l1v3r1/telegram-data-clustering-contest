      <h1>Police officer describes being confronted by Wetherspoon's burglar clutching a sledgehammer</h1>
      <h2>'It was not a standard night'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:32:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:32</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Jarram</a></address>
      <p>A police officer has described the moment he chased a masked man brandishing a sledgehammer after a gang of fruit machine burglars broke into a Wetherspoon's pub in Nottingham.</p>
      <p>PC David Grassam, who chased the balacava-clad criminal after he smashed up a police car with his weapon, said it wasn't your "standard night" working for Nottinghamshire Police.</p>
      <p>PC Grassam and his team were called out to the Samuel Hall pub in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Mansfield Road</a>, Sherwood, on February 19 this year following reports a gang had broken into the venue at around 4am.</p>
      <p>Burglars Keith Collison and brothers Mark and Lee Carter had just taken more than Â£1,000 from a gaming machine when police arrived.</p>

      <p>The gang jumped into an Astra driven by Collison and sped off in the direction of Edwards Lane.</p>
      <p>But one of the criminals - Carter - didn't like the fact their plan had been foiled.</p>
      <p>"The car came to a stop," PC Grassam explained.</p>
      <p>"One of them got out, he had a balaclava and a sledgehammer and he hit the windscreen of the police car. The sledgehammer shattered it. He then hit the passenger side window."</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old officer, who only started at Nottinghamshire Police in June 2018, was parked behind the smashed police car.</p>

      <p>His team attempted to drive in front of the suspects' car to stop them driving away. The driver rammed their car but crashed into some traffic lights.</p>
      <p>Collison, 51, of Beck Crescent, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/mansfield">Mansfield,</a> and Lee Carter, 33, of Columbia Street, Huthwaite, were arrested.</p>
      <p>But Mark Carter, 37, also of Columbia Street, Huthwaite, tried to make a run for it and raised the sledgehammer towards a pursuing officer.</p>
      <p>PC Grassam added: "I got out of the car and I was running towards the man with the sledgehammer.</p>
      <p>"At about 10 to 15 metres he turned around to face me and lifted the sledgehammer to swing it.</p>
      <p>"I got my baton out but my colleague came to my right-hand side and tasered the man.</p>
      <p>"We was wearing a lot of layers of clothing so it was not working and would not make contact with his skin.</p>
      <p>"He went to run across the road and into someone's front garden but just as he was about to, he was tasered again and it had some effect.</p>
      <p>"He tripped and fell into a heap - and I jumped over the gate and applied the handcuffs.</p>
      <p>"It was not a standard night."</p>
      <p>Mark Carter received a total of four years in prison for <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">pleading guilty to breaching a suspended prison</a> sentence, burglary, threatening with a sledgehammer, criminal damage and possessing a prohibited weapon - a stun gun at his home.</p>

      <p>Lee Carter received a community order for two years and a nine-month drug rehabilitation requirement after he pleaded guilty to burglary.</p>
      <p>Collison received three years and two months in prison and a driving ban for six years and two months. He pleaded guilty to burglary, dangerous driving, driving whilst disqualified and having no insurance.</p>
      <p>PC Grassam was awarded for his bravery alongside PC Richard Elliott, PC Anna Parkin, PC Daniel Mottishaw, PC James Gill and PC Matthew Leask at the Nottinghamshire Police Awards.</p>
      <p>They were held on November 21 at the Albert Hall in the city centre.</p>
      <p>PC Grassam added: "When I look back it is tunnel vision. All I can see is the guy with the sledgehammer rather than the stuff around me - that is the permanent vision in my memory.</p>
      <p>"These sorts of jobs are few and far between and it is nice we have got acknowledged for it."</p>
