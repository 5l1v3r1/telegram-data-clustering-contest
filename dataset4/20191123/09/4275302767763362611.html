      <p>Kayleigh McElhinney and Lindsay Slaven stood in the dock together to admit causing nearly £1,000 damage to a hotel room during a weekend away which brought their relationship to an end.</p>
      <p>The couple were reunited temporarily at Perth Sheriff Court where they both admitted getting drunk and trashing their room at the £60 per night Mercure hotel on March 30.</p>
      <p>Depute fiscal Matthew Kerr told Perth Sheriff Court: “At 3.35 am police were contacted by staff at the hotel, stating that the occupants of a room were causing a disturbance, and that one of the accused had cuts to her arms and there was blood on her clothing and all across the room.</p>
      <p>“It was noted by staff that the room had been trashed, although it was unclear exactly what had happened. Police arrived at 3.45 am and traced both accused in the room.</p>
      <p>“Mr Slaven was in the main part of the room and Ms McElhinney was within the bath with the bathroom door locked. Total damage was £885.”</p>
      <p>Slaven, 43, School Street, Markinch, and McElhinney, 31, Oswald Court, Kirkcaldy, admitted damaging bedding and a mattress, a carpet, walls, a hairdryer, telephone and mirror and a toilet roll holder.</p>
      <p>McElhinney also admitted assaulting PC Mark Ross by biting his body and attacking PCs Leah Hutchison and Lesley McDonald by kicking them.</p>
      <p>Slaven was jailed for two months and sentence was deferred on McElhinney for background reports.</p>
