      <p><b>Los Angeles</b> - Holy priceless collection! Batman and Robin's costumes from the iconic 1960s television series starring Adam West are set to go on sale in Los Angeles for an estimated $150,000 to $200,000.</p>
      <p>Burt Ward played Robin alongside West's caped crusader in 120 episodes of the camp cult hit "Batman" from 1966-68, battling flamboyant villains from The Joker to Catwoman.</p>
      <p>According to Hollywood memorabilia auction house Profiles in History, the sale will be the only known pair of complete costumes from the superhero duo.</p>
      <p>Other items from the show going under the hammer on December 17 include the bust of Shakespeare containing a secret switch to open the Batcave, and the Batmobile's famous phone.</p>
      <p>The pieces belong to the collection of John Azarian, described by the auction house as the "most important collection of classic TV and superhero artifacts in existence."</p>
      <p>The sale also includes tunics worn by William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy as Captain Kirk and Spock on the original Star Trek, estimated at $40,000 to 60,000 each.</p>
      <p>The Fonz's signature leather jacket from "Happy Days" is predicted to yield at least $25,000.</p>
      <p>In September, the same auctioneer sold Darth Vader's helmet from "The Empire Strikes Back" for $1,125,000.</p>
