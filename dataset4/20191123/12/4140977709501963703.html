                      <p>However, this is the Premier League. Anything can happen on any given day. Remember Norwich and Wolverhampton beating City earlier? Let us look at 3 reasons why Frank Lampard’s side can emulate the two teams.</p>

                            <p>The world’s obsession with Manchester City and Liverpool has allowed Frank Lampard’s side to go on about their business rather quietly. While the media has sang love songs about Lampard’s young side, the kind of dominance the side has shown has often been ignored.</p>
                            <p>The Blues had a slow start to the season. However, they are yet to lose a match in the Premier League since their loss to Liverpool at Stamford Bridge and even that was a close encounter. Lampard and his men have since stitched 6 consecutive victories and will look to add to that when they take on City at the Etihad.</p>
                            <p>Manchester City on the other hand, are coming off a loss to Liverpool in their last match. in fact, Pep Guardiola’s squad, considered the most complete in the world, has lost twice in their last 5 matches in the Premier League. This is proof that the once feared side is not as invincible as was once thought.</p>
