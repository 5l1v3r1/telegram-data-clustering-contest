      <h3>BELLATOR LONDON 2 PLAY-BY-PLAY:</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Michael Page</b>
        <b> vs. Giovanni Melillo</b>
      </p>
      <p>Silver trunks and blue gloves for Melillo, 13-4. Black trunks and red gloves for Page, 15-1. Page is 32, Melillo 34. Page’s official reach is 78.5” (I thought it was longer) and Melillo’s is 71”. Melillo hails from Bari, Italy. Page fights out of London, England. Our referee in charge for this main event is Kevin MacDonald. They tap gloves during final instructions.</p>
      <p>Round 1: Melillo offers one more glove tap and Page reluctantly accepts. Page dances back and forth in front of Melillo and lets the right hands flow freely. Melillo is keeping his hands up constantly, afraid to throw any shots lest he be caught with one in return. In fact he seems to be in fear for his life to the point I question him being in the cage. A right catches him flush at 1:17. Melillo throws a leg kick. MVP drops him with a right hand and just stands there looking at him, not throwing another punch. It’s <b>OVER</b>.</p>
      <p><i>Final result: Michael “Venom” Page wins via knockout at 1:47 of round one</i>.</p>

        <b>Terry Brazier</b>
        <b> vs. </b>
        <b>Soren Bak</b>
      </p>
      <p>True to his “Viking” nature, Bak comes out with a wolf pelt around his shoulders and an axe on his right side (obviously not a real axe). He brings a pro record of 12-1 into this fight along with black trunks and blue gloves. “The Dominator” Brazier’s entourage dance their way to the Bellator cage as he slowly enters in the black trunks and red gloves. His record is 11-2. Brazier is 6’0”, Bak 5’9”. Brazier has a 76” reach, Bak 70”. Brazier is 33, Bak is 27. Bak fights out of Copenhagen, Denmark and Brazier from London, England. The referee for this contest is Jerin Valel.</p>
      <p>Round 1: No glove tap. Bak is using kicks early. The crowd roars any time either lets their hands go. Brazier clocks Bak with a right as he’s coming forward, and Bak just as quickly moves backward. He clears his head and clinches with Brazier looking for a takedown.

Bak shoots at 50 seconds and gets another takedown, quickly jumping to half guard, as Brazier tries to sit up against the cage. Bak goes for full mount, Brazier gets to his feet, and Bak takes him down with another double at 2:06. Like Josh Thomson says “It’s a pattern and he just keeps doing it over and over again.” Since that’s the truth there’s nothing else to say unless Brazier does something to change this in the last two minutes so we’ll leave it here. 10-9 Bak.</p>
      <p><i>Final result: Soren Bak wins by unanimous decision of 30-27 X2, 29-28</i>.</p>
