      <h1>What happened to the BBC EastEnders family the Mitchells? And where they are now</h1>
      <h2>MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS Fights, lies, secret affairs and people coming back from the 'dead'...</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:13:19+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/rebecca-koncienzcy/" target="_blank">Rebecca Koncienzcy</a></address>
      <p>Five years after EastEnders started on the BBC, one of the soap's most iconic families arrived in Albert Square.</p>
      <p>Phil and Grant Mitchell rolled up in Walford in February 1990 and these bad boy brothers meant business.</p>
      <p>Their macho, thug persona was matched by their formidable mum, matriarch, Peggy and the manipulative and headstrong sister, Sam.</p>

      <p>The Mitchells have dominated storylines in the the award-winning soap for decades and show no sign of stopping with the Sharon's affair with Keanu set to explode this Christmas.</p>
      <p>So we have had a look back at the family and where the cast and characters are now.</p>
      <h3>Phil Mitchell</h3>
      <p>Played by Steve McFadden, Phil is a firm fan favourite who has had some incredible storylines over the years.</p>
      <p>From his battle with alcoholism and the 'whodunit' mystery of who shot him to his affair with his brothers wife and becoming a career criminal, Phil has has rarely had a dull moment.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The character was supposed to be the more level-headed one out of him and Phil, but over the years, Phil has become increasingly violent and shown vindictive traits - bullying Ian Beale and his treatment of past lovers like Lisa and Shirley.</p>
      <p>'Sharongate' was perhaps one of his most memorable storylines, which saw his brother Grant discover his affair with his wife Sharon, played by Letitia Dean.</p>

      <p>In 1994 millions tuned into to watch Grant beat up his brother leaving him in intensive care.</p>
      <p>Regular viewers will know that Sharon and Phil have a happy ending, as they are currently expecting a baby - but, in true soap style, Christmas may burst that bubble for Phil when he finds out Keanu Taylor, played by Danny Walters, is actually the dad.</p>
      <p>For actor Steve, Phil has been a permanent fixture of his acting career, which began in 1988 with a run of small roles in TV shows like The Bill and Minder.</p>

      <p>His role in the soap has brought him many soap awards and nominations over the years and it doesn't look like he intends on leaving Phil behind any time soon.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Grant, played by Ross Kemp, has always been the bad boy of Walford, but one that clearly has soft centre making him beloved by soap fans.</p>
      <p>His fiery temper got him into hot water ever since he first appeared in 1990 where often resorted to violence.</p>
      <p>As well as 'Sharongate', the character was also embroiled in a combustible Margie to Tiffany Raymond, played by Martine McCutcheon.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Viewers were gripped by the story as Tiff fell for Grant and he gave her physical and emotional abuse in return.</p>
      <p>Things came to a tragic end for Tiff on New Year's Eve 1998 when she was killed in a car accident while trying to get her daughter Courtney from Grant.</p>
      <p>Shortly after this storyline, Ross decided to quit the show after nine years and was written out in 1999 with a big production car crash with Phil in the River Thames.</p>
      <p>It was uncertain if Grant had survived, but it was later revealed that he had taken his daughter to Brazil.</p>

      <p>During Ross Kemp's time away from EastEnders, the actor took on a number of TV roles, including Sgt. Henry Garvie in Ultimate Force and his hilarious stint in Ricky Gervais' Extras.</p>
      <p>It was at this time that Kemp, 55, began carving out a successful career in factual documentaries. The BAFTA award-winning Ross Kemp on Gangs first aired in 2004, running for four seasons.</p>

      <p>He has continued to work with Sky One and ITV with a variety of hard-hitting shows like Ross Kemp's Britain and Ross Kemp Behind Bars.</p>
      <p>But he also made a reappearance as Grant in the BBC soap, coming back for a year in 2005.</p>
      <p>He came back to exonerate his sister Sam, at that time being played by Kim Metcalf, for the murder of Den Watts.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But with the character going back to Portugal, there is no sign of him coming back any time soon.</p>
      <p>Actor Ross has four children, one with makeup artist Nicola Coleman and three more with his wife Renee O'Brien.</p>
      <h3>Peggy Mitchell</h3>
      <p>Carry On actress Barbara Windsor was not the first person to play Peggy Mitchell.</p>
      <p>The iconic character first graced the screen in 1991 when she was portrayed by Jo Warne, who also played Julie Corrigan's mum in Grange Hill.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>She was only on screen for a few months and then Barbra took over in 1994 until the character's final scenes in 2016.</p>
      <p>Often heard shouting "Get outta my pub", Peggy was the landlord of The Queen Vic after Phil's affair with Grant's wife Sharon.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>From neighbour wars with Pauline Fowler, played by the late Wendy Richard, to failed marriage with Frank Butcher, played by the late Mike Reid, and feuds over the ownership of the pub, Peggy was a larger than life character that fans loved.</p>
      <p>During her years at the BBC soap, Barabra was forced to take an extended period of time away from Walford on 2003 due to Epstein-Barr virus - but that didn't stop her making two guest appearances during her absence.</p>
      <p>Barbara, 82, announced she was leaving in 2009, four years after returning full time.</p>
      <p>Between then and 2016 she made several guest appearances, and then returned for a tragic storyline as the character took a lethal overdose of pills following a terminal cancer diagnoses.</p>

      <p>Barbara began her career in the 60s making a name for herself in the Carry On films.</p>
      <p>She also appeared as the voice of the dormouse in the remake of Alice in Wonderland with Johnny Depp in 2010.</p>
      <p>The DBE (Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire) has been married three times and in her autobiography, All of Me, she wrote about having five abortions in her life time, saying she never wanted children, having never gotten over her own father rejecting her when her parents divorced.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Barbara's husband, Scott Mitchell, revealed that she had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2014.</p>

      <h3>Sam Mitchell</h3>
      <p>Sam Mitchell, played by Daniella Westbrook, joined the soap as a 15-year-old schoolgirl in 1990 alongside her brothers.</p>
      <p>Despite the popularity of the character, she was written out of the show twice, once in 1996 and once in 2000 due to off-screen controversies of the actress.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But when the character was on screen she had a great deal of feisty storylines, from becoming a topless model to being wrongly imprisoned for Den Watts' murder.</p>
      <p>EastEnders was Daniella's first TV job and she has spoken candidly in th past about her mental health and battle with addiction.</p>

      <p>Daniella was involved in a car crash in 1998 which left her with severe facial injuries when she was flung from the car windscreen.</p>
      <p>She was in a relationship with East17's Brain Harvey in the early 90s, and has a son with Robert Fernandez.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Daniella was later replaced as Sam in EastEnders by Kim Medcalf when Sam made a return to the square in 2001.</p>
      <p>This was Kim's first TV role and since she left in 2005 she picked up a few acting jobs such as Nurse Annie in Harley Street and Suki Vincent in Collateral.</p>
      <p>The character of Sam moved to Portugal with Grant.</p>
      <h3>Sharon Mitchell</h3>
      <p>Actress Letitia Dean has played the role in the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/bbc">BBC</a> soap since Sharon's first appearance in 1985, after making appearances in Grange Hill and <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool">Liverpool</a> soap <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/brookside">Brookside.</a></p>
      <p>She had set her heart on acting from a young age, attending the Sylvia Young Theatre School in London, and began her career early when she was cast as Pepper in stage musical Annie aged 12.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But it was <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/eastenders">EastEnders</a> that propelled the actress to become a household name with dramatic love triangles like 'Sharongate' where she cheated on her husband Grant Michell with his brother Phill.</p>
      <p>She played the role for ten years until 1995 before taking a break to pursue other projects where she took on roles in Doctors, Casualty and The Bill.</p>

      <p>But due to the popularity of the character Sharon, Letitia was convinced to come back to the East End in 2001.</p>
      <p>Sharon came back to Albert Square until 2006 when the actress left the soap again - but she was always due to return.</p>

      <p>One Instagram account 'teamletiitiadean' has over 16,000 followers and use the hashtag #QueenDean alongside their fan website 'It's All Letitia Dean'.</p>
      <p>Keshia Morgan who helps run the account said: "Well, Letitia’s fabulous and undeniably camp in everything she does, Letitia is very much old-school when it comes to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/eastenders">EastEnders</a> and the character of ‘Sharon Watts’ is definitely a first thought when it comes to thinking about <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/eastenders">EastEnders</a> .</p>
      <p>"Letitia has such a beautiful soul and has been an absolute sweetheart to every fan that I have spoken to that has met her in the past.</p>
      <p>"Personally, I think she has the most beautiful nature about her and her smile is the brightest I have ever seen, her presence alone brings me so much joy that I felt she needed to be celebrated, even if I ended up being the only one who paid attention to it."</p>
      <p>But she isn't the only one with many going wild on Twitter when Sharon graces the screen.</p>

      <p>When Sharon returned from Australia to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/eastenders">Albert Square</a> in January, viewers of the show were <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/sharon-returned-eastenders-fans-noticed-15750790">distracted by her new fur coat.</a></p>
      <p>One said on Twitter: "Obsessed with Sharon’s new fur coat. Where do I get one!"</p>

      <p>Another said: "Queen Sharon is back with a new jacket ready to rule over her Queendom! All hail the Queen."</p>
      <p>And a third said: "Sharon serving vintage face tonight. And don't start me on that new fur coat. How regal <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23EastEnders">#EastEnders</a> "</p>

      <p>Although her choice of headwear has not always gone down well. Back in February, Sharon was trying to keep warm <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/eastenders-viewers-distracted-fashion-fail-15840147">with a black beret</a> , hung low on the right side of her face.</p>
      <p>But it seemed her fancy headgear was giving off <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/fashion">fashion</a> fail, rather than French chic.</p>

      <p>One fan on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> said: "The absolute state of Sharon in her berét. Is she going to France?"</p>
      <p>Another said: "Sharon Watts still pushing style boundaries."</p>
      <p>But some thought it was a winner, one added: "I’m sorry but Sharons iconic new hat totally eclipsed any emotion I was supposed to feel for Dr Legg’s death. The stunning garment totally captivated me, it stole the episode. Beautifully worn."</p>
