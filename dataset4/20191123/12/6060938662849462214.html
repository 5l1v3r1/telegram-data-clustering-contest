      <p>KOLKATA: Former India captain and BCCI president <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sourav-Ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a> feels sighting the pink ball is easier than its traditional red avatar. Visibility of the heavily-lacquered ball especially during the twilight period has been a talking point ahead of the country's first Day-Night Test.</p>
      <p>Virat Kohli, who slammed his 27th Test ton on Day 2 and was dismissed for 136, batted throughout the "twilight zone" on the first day without facing any difficulty although against a weak Bangladesh bowling attack.</p>
      <p>Asked how the Indian captain aced the pink ball challenge, Ganguly said: "He is a run machine."</p>
      <p>On the visibility, he said: "It's actually easier than the red ball."</p>

      <p>Ganguly thanked Bangladesh Prime Minister <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/sheikh-hasina">Sheikh Hasina</a> for her presence on Friday, and promised to be present at the two T20Is between Asian all-star XI and World XI next year to celebrate the 100th birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.</p>
      <p>"I will go. I know you have gala plans for the event," he said.</p>
      <p>Ganguly, who was the man behind India agreeing to play a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/pink-ball-Test">pink ball Test</a> after initial resistance, said the success of the first day lay in the fact that 60,000 spectators watched the action.</p>
      <p>"So many watched the match that is most important. I was not under any tension but I was busy."</p>
      <p>Bangladesh were shot out for 106 in their first innings in a sorry display of batting. Ganguly said they don't have key players. Bangladesh are without regular captain Shakib Al Hasan and experienced opener <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Tamim-Iqbal">Tamim Iqbal</a>.</p>
      <p>"They don't have 4-5 main players," he said.</p>
      <p>Ganguly remained non-committal on whether India will play a pink ball Test in Australia next year.</p>
