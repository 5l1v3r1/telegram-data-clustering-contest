      <p><a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/miya-cech/"><b>Miya Cech</b></a> has joined the cast of <b><i>Marvelous And The Black Hole</i></b>!</p>
      <p>The 12-year-old <i>Are You Afraid of the Dark?</i> actress is set to star in the coming-of-age comedy flick, where she will play a delinquent named Sammy Ko.</p>
      <p>Sammy teams up with a surly aging children’s party magician, played by <b>Rhea Perlman</b>, on a bizarre adventure to navigate her tumultuous home life and inner demons.</p>
      <p>“Always grateful for the opportunity to work and learn alongside incredibly talented people I look up to. And it was a dream come true to work on a project directed by, produced by and starring strong Asian American females. 💪 Becoming Sammy Ko pushed and challenged me as an actor in the best possible way and I can’t wait for everyone to see what we created together 🖤 #marvelousandtheblackhole #tribeca #untoldstories #2020,” <b>Miya </b>wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/miyacech/">her Instagram</a>.</p>
      <p>The film is set to premiere at the <i>2020 Tribeca Film Festival</i> in April.</p>
