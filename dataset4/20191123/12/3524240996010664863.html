      <p>The 9 Brigade Command of the Nigeria Army, Ikeja Cantonment in Lagos State, on Saturday, paraded a hard drug peddler, Collins,  caught with 60 wraps of substance suspected to be cocaine.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old suspect was arrested in Festac Town.</p>
      <p>The Commander of the Brigade, Brig. -Gen. Musa Etsu-Ndagi, told newsmen on Saturday that the suspect was arrested in the early hours of Friday.</p>
      <p>Etsu-Ndagi said that the suspect was arrested by the men of the Exercise Crocodile Smile, adding that the exercise was already yielding results.</p>
      <p>The commander added that the suspect would be handed over to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency for further investigation.</p>
      <p>“You will recall that the Chief of Army Staff ( COAS) Lt.- Gen. Tukur Buratai, on November 19  flagged-off Exercise Crocodile Smile.</p>
      <p>“The exercise is now yielding result; the suspect was arrested by the Operation Crocodile Smile troop and he confessed to committing the crime.”</p>
      <p>The Commander advised drug dealers to desist from trading in such substances saying it was increasing crime in the society.</p>
      <p>“I strongly advise drug dealers to desist from trading in substances of this nature because these are substances that actually exacerbate crime in society.</p>
      <p>“When people take these substances, they become violent and will not know what they are doing anymore.”</p>
