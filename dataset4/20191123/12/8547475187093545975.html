        <b>Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen criticised the social media company during a speech in New York.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The "Borat" star also said that if Facebook has existed in the 1930s, it would have let "Hitler buy anti-Semitic ads" and been a platform for his racist beliefs.</p>
      <p>Speaking in New York, the comedian criticised the social media giant, and also said Twitter and Youtube push "absurdities onto billions of people".</p>
      <p>Addressing the Anti-Defamation League's Never is Now summit, Baron Cohen said: "If you pay them, Facebook will run any 'political' ad you want, even if it's a lie. And they'll even help you micro-target those lies to their users for maximum effect.</p>
      <p>Under this twisted logic, if Facebook were around in the 1930s, it would have allowed Hitler to post 30-second ads on his 'solution' to the 'Jewish problem'."</p>
      <p>Baron Cohen criticised Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg's decision not to ban political ads, even those containing falsehoods, saying it was time "for a fundamental rethink of social media and how it spreads hate, conspiracies and lies".</p>
      <p>He also questioned the company's claims that they are a bastion of "free expression".</p>
      <p>"I think we could all agree that we should not be giving bigots and paedophiles a free platform to amplify their views and target their victims," he added.</p>

      <p>His comments come after international lawmakers began pressuring social media firms to ban targeted adverts on social media until they are properly regulated.</p>
      <p>In October, Twitter announced that they <a href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/world-news/twitter-bans-all-political-adverts-after-facebook/">would be banning all political advertising from 22 November.</a></p>
      <p>Google have also announced that they will no longer allow political advertisers to use browsing data to "microtarget" consumers.</p>
      <p>Despite this, Facebook has refused to follow suit said that it does not think it should be the one to make decisions about its users speech.</p>
      <p>The company said in a statement: "We ban people who advocate for violence and we remove anyone who praises or supports it.</p>
      <p>"Nobody, including politicians, can advocate or advertise hate, violence or mass murder on Facebook."</p>
