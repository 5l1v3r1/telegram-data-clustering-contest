        <b>WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder said “don’t blink” as there will be fireworks when he fights Luis Ortiz for a second time.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Deontay Wilder warned he will show “no mercy” on a trimmer Luis Ortiz when they do battle in a heavyweight rematch at the MGM Grand on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Ortiz weighed in at 236.5lbs in Las Vegas on Friday – five pounds slimmer than when they first fought in March last year – and Wilder tipped the scales at 219.5lbs.</p>
      <p>Wilder knocked Ortiz out in the 10th round of their first bout in Brooklyn and the WBC world champion declared that history will repeat itself.</p>
      <p>“This time he knows what it’s going to be, he knows what happened the first time and what will happen the second time. He looked good though,” said the American.</p>
      <p>“On Saturday night, I will have no mercy for him when I’m ready to do what I do. We know what’s coming but we don’t know when it’s coming. When it does, bang, goodnight.</p>
      <p>“Don’t blink, it’s going to be an amazing fight.”</p>

      <p>Veteran Ortiz was in no mood to respond to the trash talk.</p>
      <p>“Tomorrow is our night, I’m ready.” said the 40-year-old Cuban.</p>
