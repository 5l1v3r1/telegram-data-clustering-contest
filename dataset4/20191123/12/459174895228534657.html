      <p>The Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), a coalition that ruled Ethiopia since 1991 is officially dead. In a unanimous decision , the party voted to form a single party. The new party will be called Prosperity Party.</p>
      <p>“The unanimous decision passed today to merge the Party is a crucial step in harnessing our energy to work toward a shared vision. Prosperity Party is committed to strengthening &amp; applying a true Federal system which recognizes the diversity and contributions of all Ethiopians,” Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>The Tigrean People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), that created and dominated EPRDF for 27 years, abstained from voting and condemned the move to form a single party as rushed and undemocratic.</p>
      <p>Ethiopia is scheduled to hold a general election in May 2020, the first democratic test for the new reformist Prime Minster.</p>
