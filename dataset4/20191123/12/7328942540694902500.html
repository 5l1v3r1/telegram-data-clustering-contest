      <p>Kangaroos are cute and they seem friendly but are they really? In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WGo4li2K0o&amp;feature=emb_logo">video</a> brought to you by ViralHog we see one of these adorable creatures attack a paraglider for no apparent reason.</p>
      <p>Here is what happened according to the paraglider's own words:</p>
      <p>"I had been Paragliding cross country for two hours near Canberra and had reached a position where I had to land. It is the last cleared valley where I could safely land, as over the next ridge there is only wilderness and trees. I decided to land on the concrete slab of the old Orroral Space Tracking Station. I was concentrating on the landing and didn't notice the Kangaroo until after I landed. As it ran towards me I thought it was being friendly so I said 'What's Up, Skip?' It then attacked me twice before hopping away. I packed up my paraglider and had to walk several kilometers to get phone reception and call a friend to come and collect me."</p>
      <p>What do you think the kangaroo was doing? Was it scared of the paraglider or did it simply want to play?</p>
