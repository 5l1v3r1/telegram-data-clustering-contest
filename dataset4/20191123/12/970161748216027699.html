      <p>Kylie Jenner has already got her Christmas lights up more than a month before the big day, ready for some festive fun.</p>
      <p>We stan an organised queen.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old gave fans a glimpse into her holiday decorations, sharing a video of the festivities on Instagram.</p>
      <p>In a short clip on her story, the mum-of-one told her 151million followers: ‘Christmas lights going up.’</p>
      <p>Fairy lights could just about be seen hanging off one of the many trees in the Lip Kit mogul’s driveway.</p>
      <p>She also showed off lights in bushes on her property, and a wreath placed above her windows.</p>
      <p>While the vibe is a little more subtle than we’re used to the Kardashian-Jenner gang gracing us with, we’re still living for the early Christmas goodness.</p>

      <p>Ky isn’t the only famous face to make a start on decorating her house, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/jodie-marsh-trolled-christmas-decorations-october-grinches-10886349/">as Jodie Marsh popped up her tree in October</a>.</p>

      <p>Just a year after she was named the youngest self-made billionaire, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/kylie-jenner-sells-cosmetics-company-share-600m-becoming-youngest-self-made-billionaire-11176988/">the make-up entrepreneur has sold 51% of her brand to Coty</a> – joining the likes of MaxFactor, Clairol and CoverGirl.</p>
      <p>In a joint statement, Coty and Kylie confirmed that she will continue to lead all creative efforts and ‘communications initiatives’.</p>
      <p>‘I’m excited to partner with Coty to continue to reach even more fans of Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin around the world,’ the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star said.</p>
      <p>‘I look forward to continuing the creativity and ingenuity for each collection that consumers have come to expect and engaging with my fans across social media.</p>
      <p>‘This partnership will allow me and my team to stay focused on the creation and development of each product while building the brand into an international beauty powerhouse.’</p>
