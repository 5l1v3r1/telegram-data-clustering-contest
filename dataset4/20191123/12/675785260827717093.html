      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/love-island">Love Island</a> fans are convinced <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/amber-gill">Amber Gil</a> l and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ovie-soko">Ovie Soko</a> are dating after analysing snaps they posted of themselves at the Winter Wonderland launch.</p>
      <p>The stylish duo wrapped up warm while posing for snaps on the red carpet as the annual event launched in London's Hyde Park.</p>
      <p>The Geordie beautician posted a snap of herself in a white Miss Pap aviator jacket at the event to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> with the caption" “First time ever at Winter Wonderland.”</p>
      <p>The post came just minutes after Ovie posted a series of pictures of himself at the launch.</p>
      <p>The professional basketballer, 28, wrote: “Was all smiles at Winter Wonderland, it was my first time, and was time well spent.”</p>

      <p>Swooning fans who have been egging for the besties to get together since they met on the show this summer immediately took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to decode the pics.</p>
      <p>One romantic hopeful posted screenshots of their <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> snaps and said: “I’m convinced Ovie and Amber went Winter Wonderland together.”</p>
      <p>An eagle-eyed fan replied after having closely inspected the pictures - and pointed out something which she believes confirms the pair went to the event together.</p>
      <p>“Look in the reflection in his glasses,” she tweeted, referring to the outline of someone wearing white and taking the snap of Ovie.</p>

      <p>Fans are convinced the snaps confirm Amber could be moving on from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/greg-oshea-1">Greg O'Shea</a> after he dumped her by text.</p>
      <p>It comes after the Geordie liked a fan's tweet hinting her friendship with Ovie could be something more.</p>
      <p>It read: "Is it too soon to start stanning Amber and Ovie together? #Loveisland."</p>
      <p>She went on to like other tweets, like: "Amber is at a bar in London with Ovie right now. These two have the cutest friendship."</p>

      <p>A third said: "Aww our Queen @AmberRoseGill with her bestie @OvieSoko."</p>
      <p>While Amber is now single after Greg's brutal text, Ovie and his ex <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/india-reynolds">India Reynolds</a> risked an awkward run-in at the star-studded event after splitting last month.</p>
      <p>The professional basketballer and his model girlfriend, 28, reached the final three of the show this year.</p>
      <p>But the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/love-island-fans-beg-amber-20046520">pair were hit by a series of cheating rumours</a> , however said they ended their four month romance due to "conflicting schedules".</p>
