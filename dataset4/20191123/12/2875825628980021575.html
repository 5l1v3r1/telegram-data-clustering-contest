      <h1>Conor McGregor UFC news: Notorious makes big statement ahead of fight return</h1>
      <h2>The Dubliner announced that he will make his long-awaited return to the octagon on January 18</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:25:11+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/eamon-doggett/" target="_blank">Eamon Doggett</a></address>
      <p>Conor McGregor has laid down the gauntlet to the biggest names in the UFC saying he will fight them all.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/conor-mcgregor">The Notorious</a> has announced that he will make his long-awaited return to the octagon on January 18 next year.</p>
      <p>But the identity of his opponent still hasn't been confirmed with Donald Cerrone highly mooted.</p>
      <p>ESPN MMA tweeted a graphic on Friday of potential fights for both McGregor and Jorge Masvidal in a web of interconnected bouts that included Khabib Nurmagomedov, Tony Ferguson, Nate Diaz, Nick Diaz and the victor of Colby Covington v Kamaru Usman.</p>

      <p>McGregor replied to the tweet saying: "I’ll go at anyone on that list."</p>
      <p>The Crumlin fighter has already fought Nate Diaz with it one apiece between them ahead of a potential deciding trilogy.</p>
      <p>And McGregor last fought in the UFC when submitting to undefeated Russian Khabib Nurmagomedov in October 2018.</p>
      <p>It come as Nurmagomedov has said he doesn't believe Conor McGregor wants to fight him again.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/conor-mcgregor">McGregor</a> has repeatedly called a second shot at Nurmagomedov and wants the sequel to be held in Moscow.</p>
      <p>But when asked about the rematch during a Q&amp;A, Nurmagomedov was dismissive, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/mma/khabib-nurmagomedov-doubts-rival-conor-20926791">reports The Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>“Honestly I don’t think he wants that fight," he said. "How is that so? I beat him up for four rounds. I beat him and choked him and he tapped. It was a sign he didn’t want to be there, ‘let me go please’ and all that. And now he wants the rematch.</p>
      <p>"First of all he has to earn it. We’re in the fourth year since his last victory. It’s been three years and now we’re in the fourth. In order to fight for the title I had to win 10 fights in a row in <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ufc">the UFC.</a></p>

      <p>"That’s not counting the 16 victories I had outside the UFC. In every fight I earned it not with my mouth but with my actions. That’s where we’re different - he talks about it, I just do it.</p>
      <p>“It’s nice for me, because even when I keep quiet and even when I don’t say anything people can weigh it up for themselves. ‘Hang on, this guy talks and this guy just acts’.</p>
      <p>"Just talking is one thing, but when it comes to doing it, he’s completely different. So for me there are no kind of announcements or insults. He’s an idiot. We don’t pay attention to idiots."</p>

      <p>McGregor is due to return to the cage on January 18 against Donald Cerrone with an announcement expected soon.</p>
      <p>His manager Audie Attar said: “I would say that talks have been progressing. We’ve met them, we’re in close communication with them.</p>
      <p>"I would hope that an announcement could happen in the coming weeks, but at the end of the day, it’s still a work in progress.”</p>
