      <p>Police have asked 900 men to step forward to be DNA tested in this town in a bid to solve the gruesome cold case murder of a young girl.</p>
      <p>The girl, Claudia Ruf, was kidnapped, raped and choked to death by an anonymous murderer in 1996.</p>

      <p>Her body was found in Euskirchen, 70km south of Grevenbroich, which is situated between Düsseldorf and Cologne.</p>
      <p>It has a population of 63,000.</p>
      <p>German news agency dpa reported that 900 men, who were between 14 and 70 years old at the time of Ruf’s killing, have received invitations for a saliva swab test to have their DNA identified.</p>

      <p>Investigators already unsuccessfully tested some 350 men’s DNA in 2010. They say they now found new hints that could help them find the murderer by checking the 900 men.</p>
      <p>Claudia disappeared while walking her neighbour’s dog in Grevenbroich (between Düsseldorf and Cologne). Two days later, the eleven-year-old was found murdered.</p>
