          <p>With the Indian Super League returning back to action after a break of two weeks as the Indian football team went to partake in their World Cup qualifiers, the wait for action to return in the league couldn’t have grown any more ardently. And when it finally gets back underway today with Bengaluru and Kerala Blasters going at loggerheads against each other, this is a match which promises to be a ripper of an affair, a jaffer of a closely contested tie.</p>
          <p>Whilst the Indian team didn’t enjoy any kind of success in the qualification round with the side being pummelled to plummet out of the qualification stage, the Indian Super League will be witness to an opposing brand of football today. Where the Indian team was drab, meek, bleak and tepid in its approach, today’s clash promises to be anything but with both the sides stepping out looking to resume action in flourishing fashion with the three points coming carry staunch identity for either side.</p>

                <p>For Kerala Blasters in particular, today’s match is a colossal encounter. The side sit in a calamitous seventh position with their lopsided and lacklustre displays seeing them win just the lone match in the four matches they have contested till now, a woeful and diabolic run of form which has persistently embroiled them in a fiasco.</p>
                <p>The side come into today’s encounter having failed to have won since their league opening win with their most recent affair against Odisha ending in a draw. And when they face off against fifth placed Bengaluru, things are not going to get any easier with the side taking on a side who are one of the three unbeaten sides in the league, a team which has been held in massive reverence for their defensive astuteness to let in just the one goal till now.</p>

                      <p>“I think we are working well from the start of the season. We could have won all the three games (first). I have good memories of playing in Kerala and I hear it is also sold out tomorrow, so that’s great for Indian football. They are a top team and I hope it will be a great match,” said the side’s coach Cuadrat.</p>

                            <h3>KBFC Vs BFC Dream11 Goal-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>One of the reasons for Bengaluru having such a stringent and stern defence has been down to their shot stopper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, someone who has pulled off some astounding saves to see his side keep three cleansheets in four matches. With Kerala Blasters being uninspiring in attack, this is a match which emotes towards yet another cleansheet emanating for him to see us bring him in.</p>
                            <h3>KBFC Vs BFC Dream11 Defenders</h3>
                            <p>The aforementioned narrative of Bengaluru being such a responsible, disciplined and compact defence along with Kerala Blasters having managed to score just twice in four matches clearly alludes towards only one thing. This is going to be a match which is heavily inclined towards Bengaluru emulating the same acumen which has seen them imbibe in place electric cleansheets to see us move in for a partnership of defensive options from the side.</p>
                            <p>Both Harmanjot Khabra and Juana are brought in by us whilst from the other side we finally have our first player being brought into our setup in the form of Juanan Gonzalez.</p>
                            <h3>KBFC Vs BFC Dream11 Midfielders</h3>
                            <p>We begin with Bengaluru’s leading goal scorer, Erik Paartalu for this encounter. At a time when the side were left yearning for goals with their despondent outings seeing them draw their way to three encounters, the player came alive in the bygone contest to see his tally go to one goal for the side to make him an instant selection for the day.</p>
                            <p>Dimas Delgado has provided him articulate assistance to become another instrumental player to providing impetuous to the side’s attacking travails to see him come in as well alongside Raphael Augusto to complete the trivalent of picks from the side. From the opposition elsewhere, we are venturing into this one with Mouhamadou Moustapha Gning and Sergio Cidoncha, two players who’ll be asked to traverse their past an extremely guile filled defence and give some food for thought to the opposition.</p>
                            <h3>KBFC Vs BFC Dream11 Strikers</h3>
                            <p>If Kerala Blasters are going to have any chance of salvaging anything from this clash and emerging speckle free, they’ll be relying on their leading goal scorer, Bartholomew Ogbeche. The striker has scored the only two goals the side have managed to profligate till now,  a player who has shown fight and character to emerge as a shining height of beacon in a drab attack.</p>
                            <p>From the opposition, we have Ashique Kuruniyan wrapping up our Dream 11 contingent for the day.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Juanan will lead our side out as captain for the day whilst Paartalu is the vice-captain.</p>
