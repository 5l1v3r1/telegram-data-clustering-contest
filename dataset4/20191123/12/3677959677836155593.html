      <p>Cyberpunk 2077 may have gone a bit off the radar as the spotlights recently moved to the big release of this season, but the first-person action RPG by CD Projekt RED looms ever closer on the horizon with its <a href="https://amzn.to/2qGOW25">April 16th, 2020 release date</a>.</p>
      <p>The Polish studio recently reported its Q3 2019 financial results (38% year-over-year, mostly thanks to the Nintendo Switch launch of The Witcher 3 and increased GOG.com revenue). CD Projekt RED's executives also discussed Cyberpunk 2077 <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2019/11/q3-2019-earnings-teleconference-transcript.pdf">in the Q&amp;A session</a>, mostly with regards to the multiplayer component, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-cdpr-confirms/">confirmed a few months ago</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>When Chief Financial Officer Piotr Nielubowicz discussed expenses, Cyberpunk 2077 multiplayer was labeled as a 'smaller project' that has only recently begun in earnest. The CD Projekt RED CFO even confirmed there are indeed other projects in early development.</p>
      <blockquote>What’s visible on the balance sheet comes mostly from Cyberpunk – single-player and multiplayer, the latter being a smaller project that’s just starting. We also have some other things in early development, but as I said, the vast majority of expenses is related to the Cyberpunk universe.</blockquote>
      <p>Later in the Q&amp;A, CEO Adam Kiciński replied to a question regarding monetization in Cyberpunk 2077 multiplayer, stating that it will be 'wise'.</p>
      <blockquote>As far as the monetization of multiplayer for Cyberpunk is concerned, we believe right<br/>now it’s definitely too early to share any details on that or give guidance; the project is in a<br/>relatively early stage. We keep experimenting – that’s our first multiplayer game. We check<br/>various options and possibilities, and it’s definitely not the time to point you to a specific<br/>direction on that. Of course you can expect that we won’t change our general policy towards “deals with gamers” so I expect wise monetization and – always – value for money.</blockquote>
