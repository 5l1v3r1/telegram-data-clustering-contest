      <h1>Dermot O'Leary claims Nicole is 'most committed' X Factor: Celebrity judge</h1>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dermot-oleary/">Dermot O’Leary</a> has revealed his pick for the most committed judge on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">The X Factor</a>: Celebrity – and if you’re <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/simon-cowell/">Simon Cowell</a> or <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/louis-walsh/">Louis Walsh</a>, look away now please.</p>
      <p>Apparently, according to the long-serving host himself, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nicole-scherzinger/">Nicole Scherzinger</a> is the most ‘committed’ judge on the show.</p>
      <p>A maker of bops and an excellent reality TV show judge? Is there anything this woman can’t do?</p>
      <p>Speaking to the former Pussycat Doll on his Radio 2 show today, Dermot said: ‘You’re THE judge. Like if I went on that show and I got in someone else’s category I’d just walk.’</p>
      <p>‘You are by far and away the best judge on that show.</p>
      <p>‘Because Simon [Cowell]’s always doing, like, 50 million things, Louis [Walsh]’s not even in the room.</p>
      <p>‘You are the most committed. And you’re fun.’</p>

      <p>Nicole, ever the voice of reason, decided to take on more of a diplomatic approach to the host’s claims. After all, you don’t want your P45 handed to you by Simon Cowell of all people.</p>

      <p>‘I think I’ve seen Louis in the room more often,’ she added. ‘And I think I’ve seen Simon a little bit. You know, he’s Simon, he’s got a million things going on.’</p>
      <p>You’re right, Nicole, he really really has, including the upcoming launch of X Factor: The Band in the coming weeks, after he gave contestants just days to apply.</p>
      <p>The show follows a similar format to one already announced by Little Mix on the BBC, and Cowell has said he’s putting ‘pressure’ on himself to beat his former proteges.</p>
      <p>Let’s hope things between the three judges stay cordial, however, as The X Factor: Celebrity airs its live semi-final tonight.</p>
      <p>This comes, of course, after quite the controversy last weekend as<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/kevin-mchale-eliminated-from-the-x-factor-celebrity-as-simon-cowell-refuses-to-let-vinnie-jones-drop-out-11168924/"> contestant Vinnie Jones threatened to quit the show live on air</a>.</p>
      <p>The Syco mogul was having none of it, however,and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/vinnie-jones-confirmed-stay-x-factor-celebrity-trying-quit-simon-cowell-boss-11175520/">Vinnie has confirmed he will be taking to the stage tonight</a>.</p>
