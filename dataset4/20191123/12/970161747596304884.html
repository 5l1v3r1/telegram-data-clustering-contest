      <p>A young Briton has been reported missing while camping in the Australian bush, say local police.</p>
      <p>Aslan King, 25, has not been seen since around 2am local time on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He was camping with his friends near Princetown, Victoria, when he hit his head and suddenly ran away.</p>
      <p>Aslan reportedly sprinted away from the camping area into surrounding bushland. His friends tried to look for the injured Briton but couldn’t find him.</p>
      <p>Victoria Police said Aslan had a ‘medical episode’ which caused his injury.</p>
      <p>Officers believe Aslan may now be disorientated after hitting his head and lost in the bush.</p>
