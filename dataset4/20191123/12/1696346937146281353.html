      <h3>Bakkt Activity Shot Up on Day of Rapid Losses for BTC</h3>
      <p>Activity <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bakkt-bitcoin-trading-volume-sets-new-record/">shot</a> up on the Bakkt exchange, from the usual daily interest above 1,400 traded contracts. Open interest exceeded the equivalent of $1.75 million.</p>

      <p>Bakkt has been off to a slow start, but two months since the launch of the futures, the exchange has proven to be a tool to offset Bitcoin price fluctuations. So far, Bakkt activity has risen during more volatile and dramatic days for BTC, and there is a clear growing trend.</p>
      <p>The exchange is also prepared to continue smashing its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bakkt-bitcoin-futures-second-best-volume-day/">records</a>, as more traders come on board. The trajectory of Bakkt resembles that of the adoption of CME futures, which grew their volumes steadily over the past two years.</p>
      <p>The monthly Bitcoin futures contracts on Bakkt also became liquid enough and will be used as the pricing basis for a new <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bakkt-bitcoin-btc-cash-settled-futures-in-singapore/">cash-settled futures market</a> on ICE Singapore. The new product was announced on Friday and expects a launch on December 9. However, there were skeptics that saw the ICE backtrack on BTC adoption by offering cash-settled futures.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bakkt-bitcoin-futures-set-new-record-amid-btc-dump/">heightened</a> Bakkt futures activity happened on a day when the Bitcoin market sentiment fell rapidly to “extreme fear”. However, the slide did not look like a capitulation from futures traders.</p>
      <p>BTC trading volumes shot up in a bull-and-bear fight, in which prices shot up from below <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-black-friday-marching-to-7000-at-fast-speed/">$7,000</a> to above $7,300 within hours. On Saturday, volumes remained unusually high for a weekend, at above $33 billion in 24 hours.</p>
      <p>The latest sell-off also boosted dollar volumes, while Tether (USDT) trading fell to 73%. The share of USD pairs is once again above 10%. The spot market for BTC sets the price through a multitude of new exchanges, with no one market capable of swaying the price.</p>
      <p>In the coming months, Bakkt has to prove its value as a tool in a bearish market. Since the launch, the Bitcoin market went through growing volatility, and futures became a tool to offset days of wild price swings. However, the launch of the Bakkt futures market did not tame BTC’s price. Inversely, since September 23, the <a href="https://bitvol.info/">volatility index</a> increased, to a current level of about 4%.</p>
