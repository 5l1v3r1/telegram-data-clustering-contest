      <p>MUSCATINE, Iowa (AP) — An Iowa grandmother convicted of the 1992 killing of her former boyfriend has been sentenced to 50 years in prison, which was the maximum allowed.</p>
      <p>The Muscatine Journal reports that 56-year-old Annette Cahill showed no emotion when she was sentenced Friday.</p>
      <p>Following a mistrial earlier this year, Cahill was convicted in September of second-degree murder in the baseball bat beating death of 22-year-old bartender Corey Wieneke. Her attorney says she plans to appeal.</p>
      <p>Police have said Cahill had been in an intimate relationship with Wieneke and that had a heated argument about his involvement with another woman. Wieneke was found dead on the floor of his bedroom in rural West Liberty in October 1992.</p>
      <p>The case against Cahill relied on testimony from a woman who said she was 9 years old when she overheard Cahill confess to killing Wieneke.</p>
