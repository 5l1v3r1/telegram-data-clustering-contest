      <p>The areas of the North East with the highest rated nurseries and childminders have been revealed in the latest data on Ofsted inspections.</p>
      <p>Figures show that the best ranked area in the region was Middlesbrough, where three in ten early years childcare providers (29.7%) were rated as outstanding at the end of August.</p>
      <p>That was up from 19.6% in 2018, and compares to 19.8% across England as a whole.</p>
      <p>Redcar and Cleveland was the least likely to have outstanding providers - just 16.5% were rated as such in August this year, the same as a year before.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-upon-tyne">Newcastle</a>, 20.3% of providers were outstanding, up from 18.1%.</p>
      <p>Across the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/">North East</a>, 21.4% of providers were outstanding, up from 19.2%.</p>
      <p>There were 15 providers across the North East, with 266 places, rated as inadequate at the end of August, up from 14 a year before.</p>
      <p>The number of childminders in the North East has dropped by a fifth since 2015, when Ofsted’s figures begin.</p>
      <p>At the end of August 2015, there were 1,935 childminders registered in the local authority area. By 2019, that had fallen to 1,514.</p>
      <p>However, the number of childcare places available has risen by nearly a third over the same period - up from 16,138 to 20,922 - due to an increase in places in childcare on non-domestic premises.</p>
      <p>Childcare on non-domestic premises includes nurseries, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/education">pre-schools</a>, holiday clubs and other group-based settings.</p>
      <p>However, it does not include early years provision in schools, for children aged two and up, which is inspected as part of the overall rating for the school.</p>

      <p>Across England, one in five providers (19.8%) were rated as outstanding at the end of August.</p>
      <p>The proportion of providers rated as good (75.9%) or inadequate (1.0%) has remained about the same for the past four years.</p>
      <p>At their most recent inspection, 23.5% of non-domestic providers were judged outstanding, compared with 17.2% of childminders.</p>
      <p>However, the proportion of providers judged either good or outstanding for these two provider types was fairly similar.</p>
      <p>There were 38,500 childminders registered with Ofsted at the end of August - down by 9,500 (20%) since 2015.</p>
      <p>Despite the decreasing numbers of childminders, the number of childcare places increased by 1% since 31 March 2019, due to an increase in the number of places offered at non-domestic premises.</p>
      <p>At the end of August, there were around 10,700 state-funded schools with rating for the early years provision as part of their most recent school inspection.</p>
      <p>Of these, 82% were judged good or outstanding on the overall effectiveness of the school and 89% were judged to be good or outstanding for early years provision.</p>
