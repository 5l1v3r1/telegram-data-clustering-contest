      <h1>Outraged McDonald's fans claim Christmas lattes look 'nothing like pictures'</h1>
      <h2>McDonald's has rejected the complaints, saying the cream and syrup melted because customers left the beverage for too long before drinking</h2>

      <p>McDonald's fans are fuming after claiming the chain’s Christmas drink range is nothing like the adverts.</p>
      <p>The millionaires latte features a swirl of caramel biscuit syrup and topped with chocolate cream, the toffee version is blended with a sweet toffee syrup and topped with cream, <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/mcdonalds-lattes-millionaires-toffee-chistmas-17302444">Manchester Evening News reports.</a></p>
      <p>However, those purchasing the festive-feeling beverages say they look nothing like McDonald's advertisement pictures.</p>
      <p>Prices for he lattes vary but tend to range between £1.99 for a medium and £2.29 for a large.</p>
      <p>But customers say the drinks are not a full cup, stopping short of what appears to be half full.</p>

      <p>One annoyed customer tweeted: "@McDonaldsUK @McDonalds is this meant to be your Christmas millionaires edition? First of all it's not even full, second it's definitely not the advertised one #McDonalds #mcdonaldsuk," alongside a rather empty and sad looking hot drink.</p>
      <p>Another said the drink ruined their day: ”Fuming mate, second Millionaire Latte from @McDonalds WITHOUT cream. No it hadn't melted and no it hadn't stuck to the lid. Day, ruined.”</p>
      <p>A third said: "What is that!? @McDonalds it’s supposed to be a toffee latte but you seem to have forgotten to put the latte in there!"</p>

      <p>Whilst another compared 'expectation versus reality': "Just took the lid off of my large toffee latte at @McDonalds ... this is like a visual representation of what adulthood feels like after thinking, as a child, it’ll be all parties and fun with the money you earn but it’s really all bills and debts. Expectation Vs Reality."</p>
      <p>A McDonald's spokesperson has addressed the complaints: "As with any cream on top of a hot drink, if left for a period of time, our swirl of chocolate cream and a caramel drizzle will blend into the latte.</p>
      <p>"Most of our customers are loving it too much to leave it that long, but if it does melt then you’ll still get all of the great flavours, just combined with your drink instead of on top."</p>
