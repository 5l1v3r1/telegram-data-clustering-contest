      <h1>Danny DeVito Gives His Blessing To Colin Farrell Playing The Penguin In ‘The Batman’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:08:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:08</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel West</a></address>
      <p>Robert Pattinson’s Batman may have found a new villain in Colin Farrell — and the actor who previously played the role is giving his blessing.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/colin-farrell-the-penguin-batman-movie-cast-1202766532/"><i>Deadline</i></a>, the Irish actor is reportedly in talks to play the sewer-dwelling villain The Penguin in the Matt Reeves-directed film “The Batman”.</p>
      <p>The comic book role was previously played by Danny DeVito in Tim Burton’s 1992 movie “Batman Returns”, with “Rocky” star Burgess Meredith playing the villain in the campy 1960s “Batman” TV series.</p>

      <p>If Warner Bros. can close the deal, Farrell, 43, will round out a trio of villains that already include Paul Dano as The Riddler and Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman. Jonah Hill was previously considered for an undisclosed villain role, with reports speculating he was being looked at for the role of The Penguin, but negotiations broke down with the actor in early fall.</p>
      <p>Speaking with <a href="https://screenrant.com/the-batman-penguin-exclusive-danny-devito-colin-farrell-thoughts/"><i>ScreeRant</i></a>, O.G. Penguin Danny DeVito shared his thoughts on Farrell portraying the iconic baddie.</p>
      <p>“Colin’s a great actor,” who recently worked with Farrell in Disney’s live-action remake of “Dumbo”. “He’s a good friend of mine. I’ve known him for many years and I think he’s going to do a great job as The Penguin. It’s going to be really interesting to see his take on it.”</p>
      <p>“The Batman” wouldn’t be Farrell’s first foray into the superhero genre or super-villain territory. He previously played the over-the-top bad guy Bullseye opposite Ben Affleck in the critically maligned 2003 movie “Daredevil”.</p>
