      <p>She cited the personal pressures of motherhood as her reason for resigning.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/i-had-taken-my-armour-off-and-i-didn-t-want-to-put-it-on-again-kvfffz3t0">Speaking to The Times</a>, she said: “I took my armour off and I didn’t want to put it on again.</p>
      <p>“I already knew my heart wasn’t in it.</p>
      <p>“I was in two minds about whether I wanted to come back. I knew I would have to come back.</p>
      <p>“I had to make the point that you don’t have a baby and don’t come back. So I needed to come back.</p>
      <p>“I stupidly decided to go straight into a party conference and work 11 straight days while still breastfeeding. But I had to come back and prove that you could do it.”</p>

      <p>The ex-Scots Tory boss also told how she was offered a Westminster safe seat by “a very senior person within the Theresa May firmament” in the run-up to the 2017 election.</p>
      <p>But Ms Davidson denied any ambitions to be Prime Minister.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/scotland/ruth-davidson-interview-my-heart-wasnt-in-it-any-more-xk36rkblq">She told The Times</a>: “That wasn’t the plan and was never the plan. There was no finagling.”</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old admitted “internal conflict” with PM Boris Johnson over Brexit also played a role in her party leadership exit.</p>
      <p>She said: “There was a huge internal conflict and you can’t lead if you’re conflicted on what the biggest issue of an election is going to be.”</p>
      <p>Despite backing a Remain vote in the 2016 EU referendum she is still campaigning for the Scottish Tories ahead of next month’s crunch election poll.</p>

      <p>She remains firmly against any re-run of 2014’s Scottish independence vote.</p>
      <p>She said: “I’m finding around constituencies that there are a lot of people who are sort of like me, in that they are No-voting Remainers, and they are confused about what to do.</p>
      <p>“Many of them lent us their vote in 2017. They don’t consider themselves Tories but they voted for us because they wanted to knock Nicola Sturgeon off her stride and they knew that was a way to do that.</p>
      <p>“My advice to them in this election is there is only one way to stop having these referendums next year.</p>
      <p>“I would absolutely ask these people, whether they come from a Liberal or a Labour or a Tory tradition, even if they are annoyed by Brexit, even if they don’t particularly like the various incumbents in No 10, to make sure they make the right choice in this election.</p>
      <p>"And that is to make sure there isn’t an unholy Sturgeon-Corbyn alliance.”</p>
