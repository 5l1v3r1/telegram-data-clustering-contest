        <b>Jose Mourinho has explained the three changes he made to his Tottenham starting line-up, whilst suggesting that <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/christian-eriksen">Christian Eriksen</a> may sit on the sidelines if he does not commit his future to the club.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mourinho named both Eric Dier and Lucas Moura in his first <a href="https://livescore.teamtalk.com/England-Premier-League-West-Ham-United-vs-Tottenham-829872"><b>Tottenham side for the game at West Ham.</b></a></p>
      <p>Mourinho tried to sign both men in the past, Dier for Manchester United and Moura at Real Madrid, and has shown his faith by selecting them at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>The side showed three changes from Mauricio Pochettino’s last game in charge, with Harry Winks, Moura and Toby Alderweireld all included.</p>
      <p>Mourinho speaking to <i>BT Sport,</i> said: “I think today is about a bit of everything. Motivation – I think they always had it.</p>

      <p>“People think when results are bad it’s about motivation but they are professionals and they always try their best. Tactics – we have just a few little important things, but I have not changed a lot just little things I think will help.</p>
      <p>“We are going to try and find some positions and be dynamic in the little time we have had to work with Kane, Son and Moura. I like the ideas, but can we work the ideas and see if we can find happiness.”</p>
      <p>Speaking about Christian Eriksen, who was left on the bench at the London Stadium, Mourinho said: “It’s not just about continuity . The match is very important, but our future is also very important. I need to understand what is in Christian’s mind or heart and we have to make the right decision for the club.”</p>
