      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/turkey.html">Turkey</a> has offered four million lira ($700,000) for information leading to the arrest of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/07/gaza-curse-mohammed-dahlan-170730070104332.html">Mohammed Dahlan</a>, a former official in the Palestinian Fatah party who lives in exile in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-arab-emirates.html">United Arab Emirates</a> (UAE).</p>
      <p>Ankara accuses the 58-year-old of being a mercenary for the UAE and involved in a 2016 coup attempt against Turkish President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a>.</p>

      <p>Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu on Friday told the Hurriyet newspaper that Dahlan was placed on the "most-wanted terrorists list", linking him to what Ankara calls the Gulenist Terror Group (FETO) and US-based Turkish businessman <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/fethullah-gulen.html">Fethullah Gulen</a>.</p>
      <p>Ankara blames Gulen and his FETO movement for the coup attempt on July 15, 2016. Gulen denies involvement.</p>
      <p>Turkish newspaper the Daily Sabah <a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/war-on-terror/2019/11/22/turkey-issues-red-notice-for-uae-linked-mohammed-dahlan-over-his-role-in-feto">reported</a> on Friday that Dahlan was accused of transferring funds to FETO.</p>
      <p>Dahlan was expelled from Fatah's ruling body in 2011 on allegations of plotting to overthrow his former ally in Fatah, Palestinian Authority President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/mahmoud-abbas.html">Mahmoud Abbas</a>, and has been living in exile in the UAE since 2012.</p>
      <p>In 2016, a Palestinian court sentenced Dahlan in absentia to three years in prison for corruption and ordered him to repay $16m, according to his lawyers.</p>
      <p>He was head of internal security in Gaza, but fell from favour after his forces were overpowered by Hamas in 2007.</p>
      <h3>'Agent of Israel'</h3>
      <p>Turkish media regularly accuse Dahlan of involvement in the coup bid, and recently of playing a role in last year's murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Al Jazeera last month, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu accused the UAE of harbouring "a terrorist": "[Dahlan] fled to you because he is an agent of Israel".</p>
      <p>Cavusoglu further charged the UAE, which has tense relations with Turkey, with trying to replace Abbas with Dahlan.</p>
      <p>Dahlan responded vehemently in an interview with a Saudi broadcaster, accusing Erdogan of supporting "terrorist groups" in Syria, stealing gold from the Libyan central bank and "acting as if he were commander of the faithful".</p>
