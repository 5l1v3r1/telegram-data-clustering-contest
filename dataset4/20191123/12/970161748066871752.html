      <p>Pour one out for all the London renters about to realise a dog has nicer digs than they do.</p>
      <p>Kimberly Lewis, 32, has transformed the space under her stairs into a luxurious dog house for her three-month-old Goldendoodle, Jersey.</p>
      <p>It’s pretty incredible – Jersey now has a miniature home with a front door, a mailbox, a play area, and even a special camera through which her owners can remotely dispense treats.</p>
      <p>Kimberly, from Houston, Texas, says the makeover cost just $300 (£234), and plans to decorate the mini house according to the season. For now, Jersey has her own Christmas wreath on her front door.</p>

      <p>The transformation began with Kimberly and her husband sketching out their plan on the blank wall under the stairs, then cutting out a little door.</p>

      <p>They then needed to add electric through the walls so Jersey could have her own light switch, a thermostat, and a camera so Kimberly and her husband could check on the pup throughout the day.</p>
      <p>Once the major works were done, it was time for decorating; with Kimberly painting the doorframe, sticking a mailbox on front, and adding in toys, a dog bed, and bowls.</p>

      <p>The couple even had a custom artwork made to look just like Jersey.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7710433/Woman-turns-unused-space-stairs-PUPPY-HOUSE.html">Kimberly told Femail</a>: ‘It was actually a lot of fun, seeing my dream come to a reality was really neat, the further we got the more excited we became.</p>
      <p>‘Thankfully we completed without my husband sleeping in the dog house.’</p>
      <p>Thankfully, Jersey absolutely loves her new home.</p>

      <p>‘It gave her somewhere to feel safe and comfortable, and she loves the toys on the wall which I change regularly,’ Kimberly explains.</p>
      <p>‘We leave the door open unless we are gone, and she just goes in and out of her room as she wishes.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘I wanted her to have a room just as we all do in our house, she’s part of our family, even the kids love to play inside it with her.’</p>
      <p>Anyone else feeling a tad jealous of a dog?</p>
