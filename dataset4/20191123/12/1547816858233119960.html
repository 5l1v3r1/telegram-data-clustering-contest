      <p>Just like her spate of back-to-back successful films, her sartorial choices are also getting better with each passing day. Bhumi Pednekar’s becoming a style diva totally and we’re digging her fashionable outfits.<br/><br/>The actress seems to have developed an affinity towards shimmery and glittery outfits of late. Four of her striking public appearances depict all that shimmer and jazz. Her outfits are just bound to give the party-goers some crazy options for their OOTN.<br/><br/>So let’s quickly decode her shimmery ensembles that have got us hooked on to her wardrobe totally.<br/><br/>Bhumi Pednekar is a babe in this bronze spaghetti strap shimmery dress by Alina Anwar couture. The sequined dress has a deep v-neckline making her look hotter as she flaunted those enviable curves. She can very well be the life of a party in this sexy outfit!</p>

      <p>Bhumi Pednekar’s a total stunner in an all-white sequin saree by ace designer Manish Malhotra. The best part is the saree is high on sequin but doesn’t hurt the eye. She paired the saree with a matching sunshine blouse that had a plunging neckline. Her saree does all the talking in this look as she goes for zero accessories.</p>
