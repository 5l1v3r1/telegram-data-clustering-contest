      <h2>Lottery winner Adrian Bayford, who scooped £148million on a EuroMillion draw in 2012, said he had moved out of his house but is planning on moving to Scotland</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:31:16+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/euromillions">EuroMillions</a> winner Adrian Bayford has reportedly moved out of his £10million Suffolk mansion.</p>
      <p>Former postie Mr Bayford, 49, scooped an incredible £148million in 2012, but his marriage broke down and his wife Gillian, 47, divorced him just 15 months later.</p>
      <p>She said their eight-year marriage had broken down "irretrievably" and moved to Scotland with their two children.</p>
      <p>Since then, Mr Bayford has remained in England and had a string of failed relationships with women, but friends claim he has now decided to quit his Suffolk estate for a four-bed detached home in Dundee.</p>

      <p>They say he has moved north so he can see his children regularly.</p>
      <p>Friends said his new home is within walking distance of his ex-wife - who married convicted fraudster Brian Deans - and the kids.</p>
      <p>Claming Mr Bayford "hasn't been happy for a while", a source told the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10404508/euromillions-winner-adrian-bayford-quits-his-10-million-suffolk-mansion-to-move-near-his-ex-gillian-in-scotland/">Sun:</a> "He’s got all this money and he’s finally worked out what he wants to do with it all - be near his kids and their mum."</p>

      <p>“He’s been through a string of break-ups there and people have taken advantage of him. The money made him lonely. </p>
      <p>“It had reached the stage where he was just sat around watching sport and eating."</p>
      <p>The source claims the £10million mansion, which Mr Bayford purchased with his ex-wife after their lottery win, was full of sad memories for him.</p>

      <p>Removal vans were seen at the estate this week before Mr Bayford was driven to his new home by his parents, it was reported.</p>
      <p>But Mr Bayford, who once ran a music store, insisted on Friday night that he was not moving to Scotland and instead planning to follow his dream of moving to Australia.</p>
      <p>After Mr Bayford's marriage ended, he got engaged to stable girl Samantha Burbidge, then 27, after a six-week relationship.</p>
      <p>But their relationship didn't last long and resulted in Ms Burbidge walking out in January 2017.</p>
      <p>Mr Bayford, originally from Haverhill, Suffolk, was later reportedly dumped by waitress Lisa Kemp after she found messages to former flame Marta Jarosz.</p>
