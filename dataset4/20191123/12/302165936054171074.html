      <p>BAGHDAD, Nov 23 — US Vice President Mike Pence flew in to Iraq on Saturday to meet American troops stationed in the country’s western desert, a security source told AFP.</p>
      <p>Pence’s unannounced landing at Ain al-Asad base — his first visit to Iraq as vice president — came nearly a year after President Donald Trump made his own surprise trip to the sprawling complex.</p>
      <p>Trump drew criticism for the lightning-fast visit, in which he briefly met with troops but did not see any Iraqi officials.</p>
      <p>That visit was veiled in such secrecy there was speculation that most Iraqi authorities had not been informed the president was coming.</p>
      <p>No schedule has been announced for Pence’s visit, and the US embassy in Baghdad told AFP it had no details to share on the trip. </p>
      <p>The US has 5,200 troops stationed in Iraqi bases across the country.</p>
      <p>Washington led the 2003 invasion of Iraq that toppled then-dictator Saddam Hussein, dismantled its security forces and then attempted to rebuild the country’s institutions.</p>
      <p>After years of working closely together, ties between the two countries are currently at their “coldest”, US and Iraqi officials have told AFP.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi, in office for the past year, has yet to visit Washington, and Trump has not met top officials in Baghdad. — AFP</p>
