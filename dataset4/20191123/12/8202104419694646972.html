      <h3>Incentives shouldn’t be required to help environment</h3>
      <p>Re: <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/new-solar-program-off-to-gloomy-start-as-orders-wane-say-ndp-and-company">NDP blasts new solar program after rates cut</a> (SP, Nov. 5)</p>
      <p>It seems that the residential solar panel industry is upset that their business is drying up because government incentives have been significantly reduced. But let’s remember who the government is … it is the taxpayer.</p>
      <p>Surely the industry and the leader of the NDP can’t be serious that the taxpayer should forever subsidize the purchase and installation of solar panels on private individuals’ homes.</p>
      <p>If these seemingly self-serving environmentalists of convenience truly cared about improving the environment, they would be installing their solar panels regardless of whether the incentive program had changed or not. But, alas, their true colours shine through. They and the partisan NDP leader appear to be interested in environmental improvements to their own private property only when someone else — in this case the taxpayer — is footing a good chunk of the bill.</p>

        <b>Political statement disputes remarks</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a Nov. 4 letter, Sean Polreis states that The StarPhoenix is “<a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/opinion/letters/letters-to-the-editor-nov-4">no place for political agenda</a>” and in his second paragraph he makes quite the political statement saying, “a politician I personally did not want as prime minister …”</p>
      <p>Mr. Polreis, that’s quite the “political” statement you made there.</p>

        <b>Protect the Northeast Swale</b>
      </p>
      <p>I would invite city council to be leaders in favour of the environment in regard to the <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/saskatoon-city-hall-to-study-speed-on-chief-mistawasis-bridge-roadway">recent complaints about the speed limit on roads</a>, and also in regard to the <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/environmental-activists-of-all-ages-urge-saskatoon-freeway-rethink">proposed highway going through the Northeast Swale</a>.</p>
      <p>By making a choice for concrete, highways and high speed, instead of natural grasslands, trees, water, deer and meadowlarks, we continue to make decisions based on convenience and efficiency which aren’t bad in and of themselves, but they need to be considered within a context.</p>
      <p>Here’s the big picture: if we continue to make decisions in favour of concrete and speed, eventually humans will have encroached on all the wilderness and wildlife and when that happens, we die. We can’t live without trees, water and animals. We’re all interconnected.</p>
      <p>When and under what circumstances do we say, “Enough. We’re making a choice in favour of all life on this planet”? Here, this year, we already experienced crop failure in parts of our province. We’ve already had serious fires in Northern Saskatchewan. The time to say “Enough” is now.</p>
      <p>Are we in such a rush that we can’t slow down to protect wildlife? One deer has already been killed on roads adjacent to the swale.</p>
      <p>City council, please support the Northeast Swale, which benefits both humans and animals. I’m guessing that there are few places in North America that have such a natural area within a municipal boundary.</p>
