      <p>(Bloomberg) — For two weeks, the nation watched as a dozen witnesses recounted the behind-the-scenes details of President Donald Trump’s campaign to pressure Ukraine to help him politically.</p>
      <p>Here’s a look, in their own words, at the Ukraine story, as told through the sworn testimony of witnesses in closed-door depositions and before the House Intelligence Committee in its impeachment investigation and in official documents:</p>
      <p>Giuliani’s shadow foreign policy</p>
      <p>Staff with the State Department and the White House’s National Security Council described a parallel foreign policy undertaken by a trio of officials, dubbed the “three amigos,” working with Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.</p>
      <p>William Taylor, acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine: “I found a confusing and unusual arrangement for making U.S. policy towards Ukraine. There appeared to be two channels of U.S. policymaking and implementation, one regular and one irregular.”</p>
      <p>Tim Morrison, former National Security Council official: “There was this second track, chiefly led by Ambassador Sondland, where Rudy Giuliani’s name would come up.”</p>
      <p>Fiona Hill, former top Russia expert on the National Security Council: “Mr. Giuliani was asserting quite frequently on television in public appearances that he had been given some authority over matters related to Ukraine, and–if that was the case–we hadn’t been informed about that.”</p>
      <p>Gordon Sondland, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union: “Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker and I worked with Mr. Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine matters at the express direction of the president of the United States.” [Rick Perry is secretary of energy, and Kurt Volker was at the time special envoy to Ukraine.]</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>David Holmes, political counselor at U.S. embassy in Ukraine: “At one point during a preliminary meeting of the inaugural delegation, someone in the group wondered aloud why Mr. Giuliani was so active in the media with respect to Ukraine. My recollection is that Ambassador Sondland stated, ‘Dammit, Rudy. Every time Rudy gets involved, he goes and effs everything up.’ He used the ‘F’ word.”</p>
      <p>George Kent, senior State Department official in charge of Ukraine: “You had Gordon Sondland giving a public interview that the ‘three amigos’ were now in charge of Ukraine.” </p>
      <p>Kurt Volker, former special envoy to Ukraine: “I never used that term — and frankly, cringe when I hear it.”</p>
      <p>Sondland: “The suggestion that we were engaged in some irregular or rogue diplomacy is absolutely false.”</p>
      <p>Sondland: “Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret.”</p>
      <p>Hill: “He was being involved in a domestic political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy, and those two things had just diverged.”</p>
      <p>A White House meeting</p>
      <p>New Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hoped to meet with Trump in the White House to boost his reputation domestically and send a signal to Russia. But Sondland testified that a condition of the meeting was that he publicly announce investigations into Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that put former Vice President Joe Biden’s son on its board, as well as a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine — not Russia — interfered in the 2016 U.S. election and did so to help Democrats.   </p>
      <p>Hill: “Every single leader, with very few exceptions, who’s either come into office or been in office some period wants to have a meeting with the president at the White House.”</p>
      <p>Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, Ukraine expert on the National Security Council: “From the Ukrainian perspective, they’re — you have a brand new president, is not from the political establishment. He is trying to, you know, develop his bona fides and continue to gain support so he can implement his agenda.”</p>
      <p>Sondland: “Mr. Giuliani’s requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President Zelenskiy. Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing investigations of the 2016 election/DNC server and Burisma.”</p>
      <p>Sondland: “I never heard Mr. Goldman — anyone — say that the investigations had to start or had to be completed. The only thing I heard from Mr. Giuliani or otherwise was that they had to be announced in some form.” [Daniel Goldman is counsel for the Intelligence Committee’s Democratic majority.]</p>
      <p>Vindman: “When the Ukrainians raised this issue of trying to figure out what the date would be for the presidential meeting, Ambassador Sondland proceeded to discuss the deliverable required in order to get the meeting, and he alluded to investigations.”</p>
      <p>Sondland: “I recall mentioning the prerequisite of investigations before any White House call or meeting.”</p>
      <p>Hill: “When Ambassador Sondland came in about specific investigations, that’s when Ambassador Bolton stiffened up and immediately, you know, brought the meeting to a halt, because he tied that to the meeting.” [John Bolton was national security advisor at the time.]</p>
      <p>Hill: “He said, you go and tell John Eisenberg — you go and tell Eisenberg that I am not part of this drug deal that Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up.” [Eisenberg is the National Security Council’s lawyer.]</p>
      <p>Volker text message, July 25: “Heard from White House. Assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate/’get to the bottom of what happened’ in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy</p>
      <p>After Zelenskiy consolidated his power in parliamentary elections, the White House arranged a phone call between him and Trump that several participants found troubling. An intelligence community employee who learned the details filed an anonymous whistleblower complaint that brought to light the call — and the broader controversy over Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Vindman: “President Zelenskiy’s party won parliamentary elections in another landslide victory. The NSC proposed that President Trump call President Zelenskiy to congratulate him.”</p>
      <p>Whistleblower’s report: “Multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call informed me that, after an initial exchange of pleasantries, the President used the remainder of the call to advance his personal interests. Namely, he sought to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take actions to help the President’s 2020 reelection bid.”</p>
      <p>Official White House call summary: “Zelenskiy: We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes”</p>
      <p>Official White House call summary: “Trump: I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike… I guess you have one of your wealthy people… The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.”</p>
      <p>Vindman: “This is a Russian narrative that President Putin has promoted.”</p>
      <p>Official White House call summary: “Trump: The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it… It sounds horrible to me.”</p>
      <p>Vindman: “The culture I come from, the military culture, when a senior asks you to do something, even if it’s polite and pleasant, it’s not to be taken as a request, it’s to be taken as an order. In this case, the power disparity between the two leaders, my impression is that in order to get the White House meeting, President Zelenskiy would have to deliver these investigations.”</p>
      <p>Jennifer Williams, Vice President Mike Pence’s special adviser for Europe and Russia: “I thought that the references to specific individuals and investigations such as former Vice President Biden and his son struck me as political in nature, given that the former vice president is a political opponent of the president.”</p>
      <p>Morrison: “I was hoping for a more full-throated statement of support from the president concerning President Zelenskiy’s reform agenda given where we were at the time with respect to the overwhelming mandate President Zelenskiy, servant of the party people had received in the Rada election.”</p>
      <p>The call summary is put into a classified system</p>
      <p>After the call, Morrison alerted National Security Council lawyers that access should be restricted to prevent a politically damaging leak, but he testified that he was surprised to later learn it had been moved to a server reserved for classified information.</p>
      <p>Whistleblower’s report: “In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to ‘lock down’ all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced — as is customary — by the White House Situation Room.”</p>
      <p>Morrison: “I feared at the time of the call on July 25th how its disclosure would play in Washington’s political climate.”</p>
      <p>Morrison: “There was nobody from the Legal Advisor’s Office on the call. I wanted them to have eyes on it.”</p>
      <p>Morrison: “I recommended to them that we restrict access to the package.”</p>
      <p>Taylor: “Even though I was acting ambassador and was scheduled to meet with President Zelenskiy along with Ambassador Volker the following day, I received no readout of the call from the White House.”</p>
      <p>Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia: “I never got a readout. I don’t think I know anyone in DoD who got a readout of that call.”</p>
      <p>Were you ever provided with an explanation for why it was placed in the highly classified system? </p>
      <p>Morrison: “Yes.”</p>
      <p>What was the explanation you were given? </p>
      <p>Morrison: “It was a mistake.”</p>
      <p>Trump’s loud cellphone call</p>
      <p>Holmes, the embassy staffer in Kyiv, testified that he went to lunch at a restaurant on July 26, the day after the Trump-Zelenskiy phone call, with Sondland, who then called Trump. He said he overheard Trump asking Sondland about investigations.</p>
      <p>Holmes: “At first, the lunch was largely social. Ambassador Sondland selected a bottle of wine that we shared among the four of us, and we discussed topics such as marketing strategies for his hotel business. During the lunch, Ambassador Sondland said that he was going to call President Trump to give him an update. Ambassador Sondland placed a call on his mobile phone, and I heard him announce himself several times.”</p>
      <p>Holmes: “When the president came on, he sort of winced and held the phone away from his ear, like this. And he did that for the first couple of exchanges. I don’t know if he then turned the volume down, if he got used to it, if the president moderated his volume, I don’t know. But that’s how I was able to hear it.”</p>
      <p>Holmes: “Ambassador Sondland replied, yes, he was in Ukraine and went on to state that President Zelenskiy, quote, unquote, loves your ass.”</p>
      <p>Sondland: “Yeah, it sounds like something I would say. That’s how President Trump and I communicate, a lot of four-letter words. In this case, three letters.”</p>
      <p>Holmes: “I then heard President Trump ask, quote, ‘So he’s going to do the investigation?’ unquote. Ambassador Sondland replied that, ‘He’s going to do it,’ adding that President Zelenskiy will, quote ‘do anything you ask him to.’”</p>
      <p>Sondland: “I probably said something to that effect.”</p>
      <p>Holmes: “Ambassador Sondland stated that the president only cares about ‘big stuff.’ I noted that there was big stuff going on in Ukraine, like a war with Russia. And Ambassador Sondland replied that he meant big stuff that benefits the president, like the Biden investigation that Mr. Giuliani was pushing.”</p>
      <p>Sondland: “The only part of Mr. Holmes’ recounting that I take exception with is I do not recall mentioning the Bidens. That did not enter my mind. It was Burisma and 2016 elections.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Ukraine aid is held up</p>
      <p>During the summer, almost $400 million of foreign and military aid to Ukraine appropriated by Congress was mysteriously frozen by the White House. Several witnesses testified that they came to believe it was also tied to the public announcement of investigations. On Sept. 9, the House Intelligence Committee was notified about a whistleblower in the intelligence community. On Sept. 11, the aid was released, while Zelenskiy canceled a planned interview with CNN for later in the month.</p>
      <p>Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of Defense: “In July, I became aware of a hold being placed on obligation of State Department’s Foreign Military Financing and DoD’s USAI funds.”</p>
      <p>Holmes: “An Office of Management and Budget staff member surprisingly announced the hold on Ukraine security assistance near the end of a two-hour meeting. The official said that the order had come from the president and had been conveyed to OMB by Mr. Mulvaney without further explanation.” [Mike Mulvaney is the White House’s acting chief of staff and also maintains his previous position as head of the Office of Management and Budget.]</p>
      <p>Sondland: “I was never able to obtain a clear answer regarding the specific reason for the hold, whether it was bureaucratic in nature — which often happens — or reflected some other concern in the interagency process.”</p>
      <p>Williams: “My understanding was that OMB was reviewing the assistance to ensure it was in line with administration priorities, but it was not made more specific than that.”</p>
      <p>Cooper: “On the issue of Ukraine’s knowledge of the hold or of Ukraine asking questions about the possible flow of assistance, my staff showed me two unclassified emails that they received from the State Department. One was received on July 25th at 2:31 p.m. That email said that the Ukrainian embassy and House Foreign Affairs committee are asking about security assistance. The second email was received on July 25th at 4:25 p.m. That email said that the Hill knows about the FMF situation to an extent, and so does the Ukrainian embassy.”</p>
      <p>Taylor: “I had learned that in Warsaw, after the meeting Vice President Pence had with President Zelenskiy, Ambassador Sondland had had meetings there. And had described to Mr. Yermak, the assistant to President Zelenskiy, that the security assistance was also held, pending announcement by President Zelenskiy in public of these investigations.”</p>
      <p>Taylor: “It’s one thing to try to leverage a meeting in the White House, it’s another thing, I thought, to leverage security assistance  —  security assistance to a country at war, dependent on both the security assistance and the demonstration of support. It was — it was much more alarming; the White House meeting was one thing, security assistance was much more alarming.”</p>
      <p>Taylor: “I know that the Ukrainians were very concerned about the security assistance, and I know that they were prepared, or preparing to do — to make a public statement, that is, with a CNN interview.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Taylor: “I expressed my strong reservations to Ambassador Sondland stating that my nightmare is that they, the Ukrainians, give the interview and don’t get the security assistance, the Russians love it, and I quit.”</p>
      <p>Sondland: “I finally called the president. I believe it was on the ninth of September. I can’t find the records, and they won’t provide them to me. I believe I just asked him an open-ended question: Mr. Chairman, what do you want from Ukraine? I keep hearing all these different ideas and theories and this and that. What do you want? It was a very short, abrupt conversation. He was not in a good mood. And he just said, “I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelenskiy to do the right thing.”</p>
      <p>Cooper: “It was quite abrupt. We got — I believe we got an email. I think it came from again the Secretary of Defense’s chief of staff Eric Chewning. And it just said, ‘OMB has lifted the hold.’”</p>
      <p>Russian interference debated</p>
      <p>A number of Republican lawmakers, led by Representative Devin Nunes of California, the Intelligence panel’s ranking member, defended looking into whether Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.</p>
      <p>Nunes: “Once you understand that Ukrainian officials were cooperating directly with President Trump’s political opponents to undermine his candidacy, it’s easy to understand why the president would want to learn the full truth about these operations, and why he would be skeptical of Ukraine.”</p>
      <p>Hill: “This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016. This is the public conclusion of our intelligence agencies, confirmed in bipartisan congressional reports.”</p>
      <p>Hill: “In the course of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests.”</p>
