        <b>ALDI'S £12.99 Christmas pudding topped a taste test beating out more expensive rivals from Waitrose, Harrods, Selfridges and Fortnum &amp; Mason.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In fact, the 800g Aldi pud was the only one tested that was deemed tasty enough to be named a Which? Best Buy.</p>

      <p>The consumer website blind-tested 13 different Christmas puddings - judging them all on taste, texture, aroma and appearance.</p>
      <p>The Aldi Specially Selected Exquisite Vintage Pudding scored a whopping 76 per cent leaving it at the top of the pack.</p>
      <p>The panel said it was packed with high quality fruit and nuts and particularly liked the red cherries.</p>
      <p>In second place in the taste test was as an Asda Christmas pudding which scored 73 per cent.</p>
      <p>Even better, the Asda Extra Special 9-Month Matured Luxury Christmas Pudding is at absolute steal at just £7 for 907g.</p>
      <p>The Which? experts described Asda’s pudding as a traditional all-rounder, and pointed out that it’s a bargain at almost half the price of the Aldi Best Buy.</p>
      <p>In fact, proving that more expensive doesn't always mean better quality, both puddings scored significantly higher than some of the more expensive offerings.</p>
      <p>The Harrods decadent Christmas pudding, which costs £14 for 454g only scored 67 per cent - as did the Fortnum and Mason version at £13 for 454g.</p>
      <p>But the lowest scoring Christmas pudding in the test was the Iceland Luxury 12 month matured Christmas pudding.</p>
      <p>It was one of the cheaper offerings at £4 for 400g but it only scored 50 per cent.</p>
      <p>The Tesco Finest Christmas pudding (£5 for 500g) also scored poorly, coming in at second-last place with just 56 per cent.</p>
      <p>Harry Rose, editor of Which? magazine, said: ‘It’s always interesting to see the challenger supermarkets taking on the big four, and in our expert taste test Aldi delivered a Christmas pudding that really impressed.’</p>
      <p>Julie Ashfield, managing director of buying at Aldi, said: ‘We’re thrilled that our luxury Specially Selected Exquisite Vintage Pudding has been awarded a Which? Best Buy, demonstrating once again that great-tasting, exceptional quality products do not have to come at a premium price."</p>
      <p>Morrisons’ £2 mince pies top BBC Good Food’s blind Christmas taste test for the second year in a row.</p>
      <p>M&amp;S wins best frozen turkey in the Good Housekeeping annual taste test.</p>
      <p>And in festive fizz, experts say this £12 Lidl bubbly tastes as good as Veuve Clicquot.</p>
