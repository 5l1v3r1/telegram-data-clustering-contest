      <h1>England qualified Harry Potter included in Melbourne Rebels Super Rugby squad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:23:01+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:23</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>The Melbourne <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/rebels">Rebels</a> have confirmed their full playing squad for the 2020 <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> season – including wing wizard Harry Potter.</p>
      <p>In what marks Melbourne’s tenth season in the competition, the Rebels have added a mix of depth, experience and local talent among the fourteen new faces who join the twenty-six players retained from their 2019 campaign.</p>
      <p>Potter signed for Melbourne in August after proving himself during a spellbinding stint in the NRC with Sydney University.</p>
      <p>The England <a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/rugby/super-rugby/teams/melbourne-rebels/expelliarmus-harry-potter-signs-super-rugby-contract-with-rebels/news-story/39e357b73e61f64a8cf5f26ef035677d">born Potter is now hoping to make his name in </a><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> and he’s more than used to wizarding banter from the sidelines.</p>
      <p>“But it’s nothing I haven’t heard before so it’s easy to laugh it off,” Potter told Fox Sports earlier this year. “I’ve seen all the movies but haven’t read any of the books, which is quite disappointing for a lot of people because they make jokes I don’t understand.”</p>
      <p>Potter is one of number of new signing to join the various Wallaby stars already at the club.</p>
      <p>“At the conclusion of every World Cup cycle it’s common to see mass movement in squad lists as players head overseas or look for fresh opportunities,” said Melbourne Rebels GM of Rugby and Pathways Nick Ryan.</p>
      <p>“We’re really proud we have been able to buck that trend and retain two-thirds of our squad. It is a direct consequence of our objective to build more cohesion and all our re-signings over the last 12 months is a testament to the belief this group has in our future.”</p>
      <p>In the last six months, the Rebels have re-signed seven players, including returning Wallaby debutant <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/rebels/players/isi-naisarani/">Isi Naisarani</a> and John Eales Medal winner, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/wp/marika-koroibete-credits-michael-cheika-after-being-awarded-john-eales-medal/">Marika Koroibete.</a></p>

      </p>
      <p>The team can also confirm the return of outside back <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/rebels/players/tom-english/">Tom English</a> for the 2020 season, who will be in a race with Foundation Rebel <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/rebels/players/luke-jones/">Luke Jones</a> to see who can be first to 100 Rebels caps.</p>
      <p>“With the team ten years old we are seeing the first strong wave of Victorian players set for regular starting spots and several exciting local prospects in our academy system.</p>
      <p>“We acknowledge there were aspects of our program and performance that weren’t up to scratch last season. At the same time, we did a lot well and it’s important for us to build from a stable base and add some quality players in key positions to add depth and belief to the whole squad and really round out our full roster.”</p>

      <p>With the departure of experiences halves <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/rebels/players/will-genia/">Will Genia</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/rebels/players/quade-cooper/">Quade Cooper</a> to Kintetsu in Japan, the Melburnians are set to enter the season with a new-look halves pairing under the guidance of attack coach, Shaun Berne.</p>
      <p>“At scrumhalf, we have three new guys who will be scrapping it out in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/reds/players/james-tuttle/">James Tuttle</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/fiji/players/frank-lomani/">Frank Lomani</a> and Ryan Louwrens,” said Berne.</p>
      <p>“Frank is an international and is really developing as a player, whilst James and Ryan have great qualities and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> experience. We don’t know yet who the frontrunner is, which is exciting. It all boils down to how hard they want to compete for that spot in pre-season.</p>

      <p>“Beyond that, we’re very fortunate to have some sensational backline talent with Matt To’omua looking set to play his first full season with us, joining Marika, Dane and Reece in returning from the World Cup.</p>
      <p>“I also know that being a Wallaby doesn’t guarantee a starting spot. We’ve brought in one of the NRC’s best talents in Andrew Deegan, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/counties-manukau/players/andrew-kellaway/">Andrew Kellaway</a> is back in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> after his time abroad and young Melbourne magician Harry Potter has huge potential. I’m getting pretty pumped just thinking about it.”</p>
      <p>In the pack, the fight for a spot in the back and front rows garners the most attention.</p>
      <p>Wallabies Naisarani, Hardwick and Jones will compete against the likes of Rob Leota, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/rebels/players/brad-wilkin/">Brad Wilkin</a> and new recruits <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/waratahs/players/michael-wells/">Michael Wells</a>, Boyd Killingworth and Josh Kemeny for a place in the matchday twenty-three.</p>
      <p>“Competition is the best medicine for improving standards,” identified forwards coach Geoff Parling.</p>
      <p>“We made giants strides in our set-piece last year but we realise the bar must be raised again if we are to challenge week in and week out in all aspects of scrum, line-out and open play. The new faces in the group have already brought a new edge and class.”</p>
      <p>Up front, experienced campaigners <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/reds/players/ruan-smith/">Ruan Smith</a> and Cameron Orr are the Rebels new book-ends, and former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/sharks">Sharks</a> lock Koegelenberg bolsters the retention of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/rebels/players/matt-philip/">Matt Philip</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/rebels/players/ross-haylett-petty/">Ross Haylett-Petty</a> and emerging local talent Trevor Hosea.</p>
      <p>The squad also includes two new South African signings: lock <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/sharks/players/gideon-koegelenberg/">Gideon Koegelenberg</a> (Sharks) and prop Cabous Eloff (Blue Bulls). Eloff was given a Rebels Development Squad Contract for 2020.</p>

      <p>“We took a really conservative approach with getting <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/rebels/players/jordan-uelese/">Jordan Uelese</a> back on-field in 2019. His time in the Test arena will see him come back a more mature player and the contest he has with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/rebels/players/anaru-rangi/">Anaru Rangi</a> will take both their game’s to a new level.</p>
      <p>“The trends we’re seeing emerge in the game at present are really a nod to the past of disciplined, tight, physical forward play and we’re developing a pack that will do just that.”</p>
      <p>The Rebels kick off their 2020 campaign against the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/sunwolves">Sunwolves</a> in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/japan">Japan</a> on February 1 with their first home game in Melbourne against the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/waratahs">Waratahs</a> on February 14, 2020.</p>
