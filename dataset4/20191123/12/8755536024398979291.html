      <h1>Gabby Allen ‘bombarded by women’ claiming Myles Stephenson ‘sexted them’ while they were still together</h1>
      <h2>The X Factor star has furiously denied cheating on Gabby</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:53:17+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://goss.ie/author/kendra" target="_blank">Kendra Becker</a></address>
      <p>Gabby Allen has reportedly been bombarded by women claiming Myles Stephenson ‘sexted them’ while they were still together.</p>
      <p>The former couple split back in August after the Love Island star found out he had messaged one of his exes.</p>
      <p>Myles has admitted he did text a former flame, but said he and Gabby were on a break at the time.</p>
      <p>Although the Rak-Su singer has denied cheating on Gabby, a source close to her has now told the Mirror Online: “A barrage of women have stepped forward since Myles appeared on I’m A Celeb, she has been bombarded.”</p>

      <p>“They have been sending proof of the messages, sext and d*** pics Myles sent to them when he was with Gabby.”</p>
      <p>The source also claimed that Gabby was told Myles was “two-timing” her throughout their entire relationship, after a woman “smugly” revealed that she was seeing Myles the whole time.</p>
      <p>During an interview before he entered the jungle, Myles denied Gabby’s claims that he was unfaithful.</p>
      <p>Speaking to The Sun, Myles explained: “We were on a break at the time when I messaged this girl, a previous ex. I shouldn’t have done it, even though me and Gabby weren’t speaking at the time and I moved home, but it was general conversation.”</p>

      <p>“I was a stupid mistake and I stopped speaking to her when we started getting back together, but by that time she’s messaged Gabby and said we’d been speaking.</p>
      <p>“But nothing happened – I didn’t even meet up with her,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Gabby’s a girl girl has a different perspective on things but we were on a break to make ourselves work better.”</p>
      <p>“We were intending to give it another go. I admitted it the moment she pulled me up on it because I loved Gabby and people make bad decisions,” he added.</p>

      <p>It comes after Gabby lashed out at her ex on Instagram earlier this week, after Myles said he struggled to find a meaningful relationship during a conversation with his I’m A Celeb campmates.</p>
      <p>Responding to Myles’ comments on her Instagram Story, Gabby shared a photo of his face photoshopped onto a leopard, and wrote: “OMG I’m dead 🤣 I’m not even watching the show but people are sending me things like this. Saying meet ‘meaningful Milo’.. 🤷🏼‍♀️🤣.”</p>

      <p>“Apparently he was on about ‘meaningful relationships’. I’m not sure the guy knows what he’s on about tbh.”</p>
      <p>She added: “I didn’t know cheating, lying and a whole load of other 💩 came under ‘meaningful’. Who knows? Each to their own.”</p>
      <p>The blonde beauty also liked some tweets about her ex, including one that said, “Watching Myles in the jungle chat about trying to find meaningful relationships when I know he did the dirty on my girl @gabbydawnallen.”</p>
