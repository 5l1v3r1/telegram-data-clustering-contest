      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> are targeting a move for Brazil wonderkid Reinier Jesus as a potential replacement for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/pierre-emerick-aubameyang/">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a>, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, reports claimed that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/03/pierre-emerick-aubameyang-considering-arsenal-exit-despite-clubs-efforts-new-deal-11033885/">Aubameyang is unwilling to commit his future to the Gunners despite the club’s efforts to get him to sign a new contract</a>.</p>
      <p>Following concerns over Aubameyang’s long-term future, Arsenal are now in the market for a new striker and have been scouting potential replacements.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/arsenal-step-erling-haaland-interest-strikers-father-visits-training-ground-11188483/">reports claimed that the Gunners are ready to rival Manchester United for Erling Haaland and have already invited the striker’s father to their training ground</a>.</p>
      <p>But according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10406535/arsenal-inter-milan-transfer-reinier/">The Sun</a>, Arsenal are also targeting Flamengo’s Brazilian attacking midfielder Reinier Jesus.</p>

      <p>The report claims that the 17-year-old has impressed visiting Arsenal scouts with his performances for Flamengo as he’s scored four goals and registered two assists in 12 league appearances this season.</p>

      <p>It’s also claimed that the Gunners hope that the signing of Gabriel Martinelli in the summer could help pave the way for Reinier Jesus to follow his fellow Brazilian to north London.</p>
      <p>Last week, reports in Spain claimed that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/arsenal-made-contact-reinier-jesus-father-potential-move-brazilian-sensation-11172044/">Arsenal have already made contact with Reinier Jesus’ father to discuss a possible transfer</a>.</p>
      <p>Reinier Jesus, who reportedly has a £35 million release clause in his deal with Flamengo, is a regular for Brazil at youth level and captained his nation at the South American Under-17 Championship earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Reinier Jesus has been linked as being a potential replacement for Aubameyang but the 17-year-old plays as an attacking midfielder and is already being compared to Kaka in Brazil.</p>
      <p>‘He will have a bright future,’ Flamengo head coach Jorge Jesus said in September.</p>
      <p>‘There are things similar to a Brazilian player who went abroad very early. He has style and the physical profile of Kaka.’</p>
