      <p>The North East charity that began nearly 130 years ago as the Poor Children’s Holiday Association was founded to give disadvantaged children a chance to get out of the city to get some fresh air.</p>
      <p>In Victorian times, the charity would take disadvantaged children on trips down the river Tyne to the coast to get away from the smog of industrial Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Now known as Children North East and the region’s largest independent children’s charity, it has been given a new minibus to help continue the tradition.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/charity">charity</a> is over the moon with the new delivery of a new minibus thanks to the fundraising efforts of Tyneside Rotarians.</p>
      <p>Bill Midgley, vice president of Tyneside Rotary and appeal coordinator, presented the bus to Leigh Elliott, the charity’s interim chief executive at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/tynemouth">Tynemouth</a>.</p>
      <p>Leigh said: "It’s really fitting that the official hand over should take place at the coast as Tynemouth was the destination for the charity’s first trips to the beach for children in Victorian times.</p>
      <p>"Today our services have increased and are varied, from parent-infant relationship psychotherapy, to mental health counselling for teens and helping young victims of crime, but we also continue to take young people to the coast and countryside to enhance their physical and mental well being.</p>
      <p>"We are so grateful to Tyneside Rotary for this fantastic resource that will be a real asset to our charity for years to come.</p>
      <p>The new bus will now give thousands of children and young people across the North East a chance to have a break from the urban environment that they live in and get out into the countryside and the coast.</p>
      <p>Children North East’s senior fundraiser, Carol Taylor, worked closely with Tyneside Rotary to secure the vehicle.</p>
      <p>She said: "In 1891 our founders created opportunities for children and young people to get away from the inner city and experience the fresh clean air of the North East coast.</p>
      <p>"How wonderful we now have our very own minibus and the freedom to venture further afield once again."</p>
      <p>Over the past year, Tyneside Rotary has been fundraising for the minibus and held several events including an 'Under the Sea' charity ball, a sponsored walk and restaurant ‘takeovers’.</p>
      <p>The charity received support from several funders including Netherton Park Trust and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/history/best-selling-author-catherine-cookson-11523397">the Catherine Cookson</a> and Carr-Ellison Charitable Trusts, bringing the total raised to £20,000.</p>
      <p>The bus was purchased from car dealership, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/lookers">Lookers</a>, which provided complimentary branding for the charity.</p>
      <p>"We were keen to support Children North East after some of our members visited two of the charity’s projects in Newcastle.</p>
      <p>"We were impressed with the support that the charity is giving to families and young people in the region and felt that fundraising for a minibus would allow the charity to make an even greater impact.</p>
      <p>"We are delighted to present the minibus to Children North East and are sure that it will be used to great effect."</p>
