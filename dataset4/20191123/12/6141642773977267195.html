      <p>Iraqi security forces have fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse crowds of protesters, killing two people, in a third day of fierce clashes in central Baghdad, officials said.</p>
      <p>Two protesters were struck with rubber bullets and died instantly and over 20 others were wounded in the fighting on Rasheed Street, a famous avenue known for its old crumbling architecture and now littered with rubble from days of violence.</p>
      <p>Sixteen people have died and more than 100 have been wounded in the renewed clashes.</p>
      <p>At least 342 protesters have died in Iraq’s massive protests, which started on October 1 when thousands of Iraqis took to the streets to condemn corruption and lack of services despite Iraq’s oil wealth.</p>

      <p>The fighting has centred on Rasheed Street and started on Thursday when protesters tried to dismantle a security barricade on the street, which leads to Ahrar Bridge, a span over the Tigris River that has been a repeated flashpoint. Security forces responded with barrages of tear gas and live ammunition.</p>
      <p>The violence took off again on Friday afternoon. Live rounds and tear gas canisters were fired by security forces from behind a concrete barrier on Rasheed Street.</p>
      <p>Protesters have occupied part of three bridges — Ahrar, Jumhuriya and Sinak — in a stand-off with security forces. The bridges lead to the fortified Green Zone, the seat of Iraq’s government.</p>
