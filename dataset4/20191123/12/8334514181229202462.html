      <p>BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraq’s southern border with Iran reopened to travelers on Saturday after a week-long closure during mass protests in both countries, the Iraqi border ports commission said in a statement.</p>
      <p>It did not give a reason for the decision.</p>
      <p>The Shalamcheh crossing near the southern city of Basra was shut to travelers after a request from Iran last Saturday, a security source and an Iranian diplomat said at the time. The closure did not affect goods or trade.</p>
      <p>Popular protests broke out in Iran last week over fuel price hikes after weeks of unrest swept Baghdad and southern Iraq demanding a chance of government. Protests in Iran have mostly subsided. In Iraq, protests continue but the level of violence has mostly decreased in recent days.</p>
