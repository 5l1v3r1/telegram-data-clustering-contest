      <p>Two-time grand slam champion Garbine Muguruza has reunited with coach Conchita Martinez for the 2020 season.</p>
      <p>Spaniard Muguruza was in the market for a new coach after splitting with Sam Sumyk in July.</p>
      <p>The former world number one had Martinez in her corner when she won a second major title at Wimbledon in 2017, when Sumyk took time out for the birth of his daughter.</p>
      <p>Mart√≠nez was available after she recently finished working with Karolina Pliskova and the 1994 Wimbledon champion has now been employed by her compatriot Muguruza.</p>
      <p>"Garbine and I will work together in the 2020 season. With new challenges and enthusiasm." Martinez tweeted on Saturday.</p>
