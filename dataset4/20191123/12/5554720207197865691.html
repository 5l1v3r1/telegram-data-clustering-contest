      <h1>Kangana Ranaut brutally trolled for looking fake in Thalaivi poster days after Aishwarya Rai’s father-in-law Amitabh Bachchan declares her number one actress on KBC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:52:32+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:52</time> by <a rel="author">JKR Staff</a></address>
      <p>Kangana Ranaut was recently declared the number one actress by none other than Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan, who had showered praises on her during a recent episode of <i>Kaun Banega Crorepati. </i>Many had found Bachchan’s gesture quite incredible given that his own daughter-in-law Aishwarya has been an actress of repute. Days later, Kangana faced brutal trolling after her first look in <i>Thalaivi, </i>the biopic on the late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa was made public. Her critics slammed her for looking fake by allegedly using prosthetics to resemble the late Tamil Nadu chief minister.</p>

      <p>While some mocked her for using several kilos of makeup, others compared her to Anil Kapoor from <i>Badhai Ho Badhai. </i>Some even felt that she looked more like Union Minister Smriti Irani than Jayalalithaa.</p>
