      <p>One of <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/harry-styles/"><b>Harry Styles</b></a>‘ ex-girlfriends is going to be featured on his new album and fans have a pretty good idea who it is!</p>
      <p>In a new interview, the 25-year-old singer explained that he added a snippet of a voicemail from the ex on his new song “Cherry,” which is about a breakup.</p>
      <p>“That was my ex-girlfriend. It got added in later on, and it felt so part of the song. It just felt like it needed it. We’re friends and stuff, so I asked her if it was okay. And she was okay with it. I think she liked it,” <b>Harry </b>said in an interview with <i><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/curator/new-music-daily-with-zane-lowe/1458161472?app=music&amp;ign-itsct=cur_zanelowe_newmusicdaily_null&amp;ign-itscg=80034">New Music Daily with Zane Lowe</a></i> on Apple Music’s Beats 1.</p>
      <p>While <b>Harry </b>didn’t say the ex by name, fans are assuming the voice will be <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/camille-rowe/"><b>Camille Rowe</b></a>, who he reportedly split with in 2018.</p>
      <p>To add to the speculation, in <b>Harry</b>‘s <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/2019/08/26/harry-styles-reveals-if-hed-ever-reunite-with-one-direction/"><i>Rolling Stone</i> cover interview</a>, his pal <b>Tom Hull</b> admitted the split with <b>Camille </b>had a “big impact on him” before writing the album.</p>
