      <p><b>KNOXVILLE, Ten. (WVLT) -- </b>Monday morning comes with patchy fog, some frost and a cold temperature of 33 degrees. As you head out on Monday, at the bus stop or to work, make sure you have a jacket and give your car time to warm up. Leave some extra time so you can be cautious around foggy areas.</p>

      <p>Light the Park in Farragut will have a clear sky, but the temperatures will fall fast as the sun sets. At 5 while the Concord Brass performs your holiday favorites, temperatures will be near 60. By the time the switch is thrown at 6:15, we'll be in the low 50's. Take a few layers to put on as the temperatures drop.</p>
      <p>If you are traveling for the Thanksgiving week, Monday and Tuesday are the best days to travel. For East Tennessee, late Tuesday into Wednesday brings our best chances for scattered rain.</p>
      <p>Tuesday we'll have a high near 62. We're even warmer on Wednesday at 64 as the rain pushes east and becomes a travel problem into the Carolina's. If you are traveling west, you'll be all clear.</p>
      <p>Thanksgiving Day will have a mix of sun and clouds, isolated rain chances, especially in the afternoon. We'll be cooler on Thursday in the low to mid 50's.</p>
      <p>Shopping plans Friday keeps a spotty rain chance in the forecast and temperatures in the mid 50's.</p>
