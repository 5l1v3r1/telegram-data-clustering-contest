      <h1>40 Years Ago: ‘Birth of the Beatles’ Is the Band’s First Biopic</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:37:07+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:37</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Lifton</a></address>
      <p>Less than 10 years after the <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/the-beatles/">Beatles</a> broke up came the first of <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/10-movies-inspired-by-the-beatles/">numerous movies</a> about them. Released Nov. 23, 1979 and shown as a TV movie on ABC in the U.S., <i>Birth of the Beatles</i> focused on their beginnings as one of many struggling Liverpool bands up through their conquering of America.</p>
      <p>The movie begins in 1960, when the trio of <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/john-lennon/">John Lennon</a>, <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/paul-mccartney/">Paul McCartney</a> and <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/george-harrison/">George Harrison</a> (Stephen MacKenna, Rod Culbertson and John Altman, respectively) picked up Lennon's friend Stu Sutcliffe (David Nicholas Wilkinson) and drummer Pete Best (Ryan Michael). Along the way it covers their <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/beatles-hamburg-first-show/">woodshedding days in Hamburg</a>, Brian Epstein (Brian Jameson) convincing them to have him as their manager, the failed Decca audition and the replacing of Best with <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/ringo-starr/">Ringo Starr</a> (Ray Ashcroft) on the eve of their first session, concluding with their <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-beatles-ed-sullivan-show/">first appearance on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i></a>.</p>
      <p>As a portrayal of their early days, <i>Birth of the Beatles</i> is at its best when it sticks to the tried-and-true personae established in <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/beatles-hard-days-night-premiere/"><i>A Hard Day's Night</i></a> and their early interviews, with the group mocking authority by bouncing jokes off each other. MacKenna's Lennon is accurately acerbic, although some of the more dramatic scenes, such as his reaction to Sutcliffe's death or his frustration with Epstein's inability to secure a record deal, are brought down by hackneyed dialogue.</p>
      <p>While it doesn't offer anything in the way of new information, it also, unlike many other biopics, doesn't play fast and loose with the facts. There are a few inaccuracies, noticeably in the Hamburg scenes -- the clubs aren't particularly seedy and the band wows the crowd to "I Saw Her Standing There" and "Don't Bother Me," for example -- but most of them would only be picked up by Beatles obsessives.</p>
      <p>Its biggest historical faux pas, however, is in the depiction of how Best was fired. It's been long established that George Martin was unhappy with his performance during the Parlophone audition and said he would use a studio drummer for the first session, and his disapproval nudged the band in the direction of replacing him. The eventual release of some of the Decca material on <i>Anthology 1</i> proves that Best was a limited drummer.</p>
      <p>Instead, the movie uses the narrative that Best, who served as a technical advisor on the film, has always pushed -- that the decision came from the other three, who were jealous of his success with the young women of Liverpool, over Epstein's and the record company's objections.</p>
      <p>Musically, the filmmakers didn't try to recreate what the group sounded like in the clubs, as was tried in 1994's <i>Backbeat</i>. Instead of an all-star band of experienced punk-influenced musicians, the music was ably performed by Rain, a long-running Beatles tribute act. Coincidentally, the original score was composed by Carl Davis, who would later collaborate with McCartney on his 1991 classical piece <i>Liverpool Oratorio</i>.</p>

      <h3>Nine Movies That Almost Starred the Beatles</h3>

      <h4>'The Yellow Teddybears' (1963)</h4>
      <p>Of the many projects the Beatles were offered before 'A Hard Day's Night,' only one is known about, because it got made. Similar to a lot of other early rock movies, 'The Yellow Teddybears' linked the music to teenage societal ills, in this case schoolgirls who wore a pin with the titular object as proof that they had lost their virginity. Then, one of the girls becomes pregnant by her boyfriend, who sings in a rock band called Kinky Carson and the Embers. The Beatles reportedly didn't want to play the band because they weren't able to perform their own compositions. The movie was released in the U.S. as 'Gutter Girls' and has also been retitled 'The Thrill Seekers.'</p>

      <h4>'A Talent for Loving' (1965)</h4>
      <p>After 'Help,' the Beatles nearly found their third film. In 1965, their film producer Walter Shenson came to them with a script by Richard Condon, the author of 'The Manchurian Candidate,' based on Condon's novel 'A Talent for Loving.' The story had the band playing four Liverpudlians who emigrate to the Old West, and concluded with a horse race determining who wins the hand of a young woman. But they rejected it, and it took four years before Shenson could get a different version of it made, starring Richard Widmark, Topol and Cesar Romero, with the home video version called 'Gun Crazy.'</p>

      <h4>'The Jungle Book' (1967)</h4>
      <p>If you've ever seen Disney's original 'The Jungle Book' and wondered why the vultures sported moptop haircuts and Liverpudlian accents, it's because the parts were first offered to the Beatles. Reports are unclear as to whether it never happened because of scheduling conflicts or a veto by John Lennon, and the vultures were ultimately voiced by others (including Chad Stuart of Chad and Jeremy as Flaps). The song that was written for them, "That's What Friends Are For (The Vulture Song)," was retooled from rock n' roll to a barbershop quartet. Nearly 50 years later, Jon Favreau tried to get Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr for his remake, but Favreau said that he came up with the idea too late to make it happen.</p>

      <h4>'The Lord of the Rings'</h4>
      <p>Lennon was much more enthusiastic about the idea of turning J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings' into a film, with himself as Gollum, McCartney playing Frodo, George Harrison as Gandalf and Starr as Sam. They approached Stanley Kubrick to direct, but he didn't think it could be properly adapted for the screen. Even if he had agreed, however, the film wouldn't have gotten made, because Tolkien refused to sell them the rights to his story.</p>

      <h4>'The Three Musketeers'</h4>
      <p>Producers Alexander and Ilya Salkin hired Richard Lester, director of 'A Hard Day's Night' and 'Help,' to helm a new adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' classic novel in the hopes that his involvement would lure the Beatles into starring as the titular characters and d'Artagnan. The Beatles weren't interested, and Lester shelved it until 1973, when a new version with Michael York, Oliver Reed, Frank Finlay and Richard Chamberlain in the roles meant for the group was released, with unused footage fashioned into a sequel, 'The Four Musketeers,' a year later.</p>

      <h4>'Shades of a Personality'</h4>
      <p>Shenson continued to look for the right vehicle for the Beatles, hoping that one would have them playing characters other than themselves. He nearly found one in Owen Holder's script for 'Shades of a Personality,' about a man named Stanley Grimshaw with four distinct personalities, each one played by a different member of the group. Reportedly, they even spoke with Michelangelo Antonioni about directing it, but 'Shades of a Personality' never got made because the Beatles became too interested in making 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.'</p>

      <h4>'Up Against It'</h4>
      <p>Not wanting to fully give up on 'Shades of a Personality,' Shenson and Beatles manager Brian Epstein asked playwright Joe Orton to do something with Holder's work. Orton added a few elements adapted from some of his other works and sent them 'Up Against It,' which, as he wrote in his diary, found the Beatles "caught in-flagrante, become involved in dubious political activity, dressed as women, committed murder, been put in prison and committed adultery." The script was rejected by the group due to its storyline. Orton then made a few changes and sold it to another producer, Oscar Lewenstein. Then Orton was killed by his partner Kenneth Halliwell, on the night a planned meeting with Lester about directing. (Halliwell subsequently killed himself, as well.) 'Up Against It' was never filmed, but it was adapted into an off-Broadway musical with a Todd Rundgren score in 1989, and then into a BBC radio play in 1997.</p>

      <h4>'Get Back'</h4>
      <p>Even though it eventually morphed into the 'Let It Be' documentary, we're counting 'Get Back' as an unmade Beatles movie because the finished film was so different from the original concept. The brainchild of Paul McCartney, 'Get Back' was intended as a television documentary about the making of their new album, including their first concert performance since they stopped touring in 1966, designed to restore the Beatles' disintegrating chemistry by recording live, without overdubs. But it went pear-shaped, with the turning point in the project being when George Harrison quit the band a few into the sessions. He returned after a week, but only on the conditions that the plans for a full concert were scrapped and that they move from Twickenham Film Studios to the studio at their Apple headquarters. Without the concert, it became a feature film, and by the time it was released in May 1970, 16 months after production began, the Beatles had broken up.</p>

      <h4>'Yellow Submarine'</h4>
      <p>Robert Zemeckis of 'Back to the Future' and 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' fame began discussing plans to remake the Beatles' animated 'Yellow Submarine' movie in 2009, hoping to use motion-capture technology with a cast including Cary Elwes, Dean Lennox Kelly, Peter Serafinowicz and Adam Campbell. Zemeckis suffered two consecutive box-office failures, however, and questions about the budget and other issues arose. Disney pulled the plug on the project in March 2011.</p>
