      <p>Wireless and noise-cancelling earbuds enhance the listening experience of fitness buffs and casual listeners alike. The Sennheiser HD1 In-Ear is highly recommended with aptX and AAC compatibility. Among lesser known brands, the Skullcandy Ink'd Wireless trumps over the Jaybird X3 with passive noise reduction and detachable cable. Price-wise, the Jaybird Tarah is the better option with the same features as the X3.</p>
      <p>What percentage savings do stores give on Black Friday? Black Friday typically sees retailers across the country offering significant discounts from 20% off up to over 50% on top-rated items.</p>
      <p>Long lines and heavy traffic continue to push Black Friday shoppers away from physical stores and towards the more convenient online portals. The National Retail Federation (NRF) reported that in 2018, 41.4 million people conducted their shopping online during the holiday sales period, while only 34.7 million people shopped exclusively in stores.</p>
