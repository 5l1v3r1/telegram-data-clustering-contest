      <p>Between November 22 and December 2, 2019, <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/FM19/Online-Only-Formula-1-Memorabilia/lots/n0531-Ferrari-F2002-Tipo-051-B-C-V-10-Engine-2002/834711?&amp;utm_source=rmsothebys.com&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=FM19&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_content=lot_image&amp;_cldee=YXV0b2Jsb2dpbmZvQHRlYW1hb2wuY29t&amp;recipientid=contact-5a7f6a223a5be6119f6414feb5caa464-493dedaa82874b80b895393c124a5909&amp;esid=767e2068-330d-ea11-8237-000c2971a03a">RM Sotheby's</a> is holding an online-only <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/auction-action/">auction</a> of Formula 1 memorabilia. It heavily focuses on the early '80s, early '90s, and early '00s and includes a wide variety of items from toy models to race-used <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/auto-repair/">car parts</a>. One of the key drivers during this period was <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/michael+schumacher/">Michael Schumacher</a>, and the number of related collectibles reflects that. One of the golden eggs of the auction is a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ferrari/">Ferrari</a> F2002 Tipo 051/B/C V10 <a href="http://amzn.to/20zAez5">Engine</a> from 2002. </p>
      <p>The Ferrari F2002 is a legendary racecar with a stellar record on the track. In 2002, with Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello driving, the F2002 won 15 of 17 races, including nine one-two finishes. Ferrari and Schumacher claimed the Constructors’ Title and Driver's Championship with ease, and the force behind those victories was the Tipo 051/B/C V10. </p>
      <p>The Paolo Martinelli-designed engine is a naturally aspirated 3.0-liter that is rated at 835 horsepower at a mind-bending 17,800 rpm. Sotheby's points out the engine was not as high-powered as some of its competitors, but the lightweight design and placement allowed the car to flourish.</p>
      <p>As of this writing on the auction's opening day, the top bid is at $2,000, but Sotheby's is expecting it to bring $50,000 to $70,000. Interestingly enough, that's well below Ferrari's <a href="https://store.ferrari.com/en-us/memorabilia-f1_cod8378037990733488.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-aif-cL-5QIVgcpkCh3hCQO_EAQYASABEgLPVfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;tp=158131&amp;utm_campaign=Shopping_US&amp;utm_medium=CPC&amp;utm_source=Google">$90,000</a> direct price. Yes, Ferrari is offering this engine, too, and it's available for pre-order. So that leaves a decision: save money and go through a third party or buy straight from the source. </p>
