      <h2>Jose Mourinho has been speaking about a range of Tottenham topics</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:47:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:47</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has explained the reasons behind his team selection for his first game in charge of Tottenham at West Ham United.</p>
      <p>Mourinho took over from Mauricio Pochettino earlier this week and has now been tasked with lifting the spirits at side that sat 14th in the Premier League ahead of facing West Ham.</p>
      <p>Spurs are without Hugo Lloris, Erik Lamela and Michel Vorm through injury for the clash, while Jan Vertonghen and Tanguy Ndombele are also sidelined.</p>
      <p>Mourinho all-but ruled Vertonghen out in his press conference on Thursday and Ndombele hasn't travelled.</p>
      <p>Erik Dier has been handed a start in midfield and Lucas Moura will combine with Son Heung-min and Harry Kane in the advanced roles.</p>
      <p>On Vertonghen, Mourinho said: "Vertonghen is almost there but not yet. Tomorrow will be the first day he joins the group. So maybe not the Champions League match (vs Olympiacos on Tuesday) but I think in one week he can join us."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mourinho has left Christian Eriksen out of the line-up as the midfielder continues to be linked with a transfer away from the capital.</p>
      <p>"It's not just about continuity. The match today is very important but our future is also very important," Mourinho told BT Sport.</p>
      <p>"I need to understand what is in Christian's mind or heart. We have to make the right decision for the club.</p>
      <p>"On top of that I believe that Lucas, Son and Harry Kane are players that have a really good understanding. We need to find ways for them to hurt the opposition. Let's see if we can find happiness."</p>
      <p>Asked if the game was about motivation or tactics due to the lack of time to prepare, Mourinho added: "I think it's a bit of everything. Motivation was there.</p>
