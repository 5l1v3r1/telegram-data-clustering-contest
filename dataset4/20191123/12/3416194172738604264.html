      <p><a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/billie-eilish/"><b>Billie Eilish</b></a> is reminding fans why she doesn’t sign autographs anymore.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old music superstar took to her Instagram story to explain what happened when a group of autograph seekers booed her for not signing anything outside of the<i> Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i> studio.</p>
      <p><b>Billie </b>first headed to a group of fans waiting outside and gave hugs and snapped some selfies.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t sign anything. It’s something that I don’t do because I used to, but I realized all anyone did was sell everything that I signed, so I stopped doing that. It was kind of like a policy of mine that I don’t,” <b>Billie </b>explained.</p>
      <p>She then proceeded to head to what she thought was another group of fans with some paparazzi but it turns out it was entirely a group of autograph seekers who wanted to sell her signature. Despite knowing they didn’t care about her, <b>Billie </b>attempted to give hugs and touch hands with the group but they were unresponsive.</p>
      <p><b>Billie </b>continued, “I was like, nobody here really wants anything from me, besides a f**king autograph — which I don’t do because they’ll sell that s**t…I started to walk away because I realized none of these people actually cared about anything that had to do with me, as a person. As I started to walk away — back to the car — they all started to boo me. Then, they all started calling me a ‘Little b**ch,’ and saying that I’ll lose my Grammy nominations.”</p>
      <p>“The fact that people can switch up like that, damn. They wait outside for you and then immediately they don’t get what they want and they boo you, and f**king curse at you. I’m like ‘Bro, I’m 17′…Anyway, the only reason I’m making this video is that I saw a video of this all happening and I just wanted to clarify what actually happened…I walked over there only to say hi, only to hug people, and I got pictures of me shoved into my f**king face. I got no love whatsoever, so I left,” Bill concluded.</p>
