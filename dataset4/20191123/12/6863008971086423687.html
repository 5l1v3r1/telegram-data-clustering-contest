      <p>The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine has said it recorded how Russian-led forces were demonstrating the newly constructed section of the bridge in the village of Stanytsia Luhanska to journalists.</p>
      <p>"In the morning of November 20, between the southern edge of the newly constructed section of the bridge and the checkpoint of the armed formations, the SMM observed at least seven members of the armed formations (wearing armbands with "JCCC" written on them). The SMM saw also senior members of the armed formations together with about 15 representatives of media outlets standing at the southern edge of the aforementioned section of the bridge," the OSCE SMM said in a <a href="https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/439772?download=true">daily report</a> on November 21, 2019.</p>
      <p>As reported earlier, a restored pedestrian bridge was opened in Stanytsia Luhanska on November 20 with the participation of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the ambassadors of France and Germany.</p>
