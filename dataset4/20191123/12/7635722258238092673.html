      <h1>Mother says one-punch attack that killed her son should act as a warning</h1>

        <b>The mother of a Longford man who died in a one-punch attack in New York has said she appreciates the remorse expressed by the man that assaulted him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>21-year-old Danny McGee from Drumlish in County Longford was found unresponsive outside a pub in Queens on November 22nd last year.</p>
      <p>He was taken to hospital but later pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>At Queens County Criminal Court yesterday, Dubliner Steven O’Brien pleaded guilty to the assault.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors told the court he punched Mr McGee once to the side of the head during an argument.</p>

      <p>The 26-year-old, with an address at 42nd Street in Queens, will serve six months in prison after agreeing a plea deal.</p>
      <p>He apologised to Mr McGee’s family and his lawyer told the court that he is remorseful and sad over the tragedy.</p>
      <p>On <i>Newstalk Breakfast with Susan Keogh</i> this morning, Mr McGee mother Colleen McGee said she appreciates the sentiment.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know Steven O’Brien; I never heard his name before,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I hope it was sincere and heartfelt and if it was, I appreciate that he did it.”</p>
      <h3>"Heartbroken"</h3>
      <p>She said her family remains “heartbroken” as the anniversary of the attack passes.</p>
      <p>“He has a younger brother and younger sister and they both looked up to him. We all missed him so much while he was away.</p>
      <p>“He had decided he was going to return home in February of this past year. While he did love New York, he had a very tight circle of friends and he missed that. He missed home.</p>
      <p>“Naturally we were looking forward to him coming home in a few months and unfortunately that wasn’t to be.”</p>
      <h3>Justice</h3>
      <p>She said a little bit of justice was served for her son.</p>
      <p>“He pleaded guilty and will serve a little bit of time and after a few months, he will go and – I assume – put it behind him and get on with his life.”</p>
      <p>“That is not an option for us but a little bit of justice was served for Danny yesterday.”</p>
      <h3>"Just walk away"</h3>
      <p>She said the incident should act as a warning to anyone about the dangers of violence.</p>
      <p>“I never knew Danny to have a physical fight with anybody,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I always taught himself and his brother from when they were young boys to keep your hands to yourself. If you ever become involved in a situation please just walk away.</p>
      <p>“And in the heat of the moment, as I said I don’t know really what happened, but one punch, it ended his young life. He had so much to look forward to.”</p>
      <p>The Longford Association of New York is holding a special mass for Danny this afternoon.</p>
      <p>A further mass will be held in Drumlish, County Longford on December 14th.</p>
