      <p>Rundown, dilapidated and dusty aren’t usually terms you’d like attached to your wedding day.</p>
      <p>But for Dasha and Taylor Milova Governors Island, an island in its off-season, filled with abandoned buildings and peeling paint, was the perfect destination to tie the knot.</p>
      <p>The couple has always loved the little thrill of sneaking into abandoned spots and ruined buildings. So when it came to getting married, holding the ceremony and reception at Admiral’s House on Governors Island just felt right.</p>
      <p>‘The thing we loved about Governors Island is that it was unique, close to Manhattan, would provide a really fun experience for our out-of-town guests (which we had a lot of), and was super intimate and private,’ Dasha, who’s originally from St Petersburg, told Metro.co.uk.</p>

      <p>‘We loved all of the abandoned spaces that we would be able to access and the idea that no one else has had a full wedding here made it even more special.</p>

      <p>‘There have been ceremonies on the Island, but never a full wedding with a reception.</p>
      <p>‘Another fun fact – Admiral’s House actually hosted a meeting between Gorbachev and Reagan in 1988, which was an accidental but fun reference to our own Russian and American union.’</p>

        <figcaption>And here’s Dasha, who Taylor describes as her ‘better half’ (Picture: <a href="https://loveandwolves.co/">LOVE + WOLVES CO</a> )</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Dasha, 28, and Taylor, 30, met back in 2006 at their university orientation but took a while to start properly dating.</p>
      <p>They hooked up throughout high school, separated for a few years when Taylor moved to Oregon and returned to date someone Dasha ‘didn’t particularly like’, then finally reunited and fell in love.</p>

        <figcaption>One of the locations the couple took photos in was an abandoned cinema with no power (Picture: <a href="https://loveandwolves.co/">LOVE + WOLVES CO</a> )</figcaption>

        <figcaption>They had to make do with torches and open doors (Picture: <a href="https://loveandwolves.co/">LOVE + WOLVES CO</a> )</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>‘I love so much about her that it’s really hard to narrow down,’ says Dasha. ‘Taylor is really beautiful inside and out, she’s a great mom, she’s funny, smart and I know she will always be there for my daughter and I.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Taylor adds: ‘Dasha is by far my better half. She is smart, caring, responsible… very, very responsible and she truly makes sure our life works (and well at that!).</p>
      <p>‘Watching Dasha become a mother has been truly remarkable and amazing to watch, I am honoured to be by her side in this journey.’</p>
      <p>After a few years of dating, Taylor proposed in their apartment in Brooklyn, surrounded by flowers, candles, and champagne and ready to sing a beautiful song she’d written for the love of her life.</p>
      <p>Then, in 2017, it was time for the wedding.</p>

        <figcaption>And a day everyone in attendance will remember (Picture: <a href="https://loveandwolves.co/">LOVE + WOLVES CO</a> )</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>While the couple originally considered a wedding at a faraway destination, they realised they wanted transport to be easy for their friends and family. Going for Governers Island, which provided the same island getaway feel while being just a boat ride from the city, provided the ideal compromise.</p>
      <p>Dasha explained: ‘Everyone loved the location – who wouldn’t enjoy a boat ride to an island 5 minutes from Manhattan, then have the island all to yourself and take a boat back with the Manhattan skylight lit up?’</p>
      <p>The ceremony took place in the rundown Admiral’s House and once things were official, Dasha and Taylor were eager to pop inside other abandoned buildings on the island to capture some truly incredible photos.</p>

        <figcaption>And they weren’t afraid to get their clothes dirty (Picture: <a href="https://loveandwolves.co/">LOVE + WOLVES</a> )</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>‘The experience [was] nothing short of amazing,’ says Dasha. ‘We have a love for sneaking into abandoned spots that stems from our childhood and teenage years.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘We’re not the type of people that would care about our outfits getting dusty or going into a space that has no electricity, so we enjoyed every moment of it.’</p>
      <p>It started raining as the couple posed in empty old cinemas and vintage bathrooms, giving the photos the dark, moody vibe the couple were after.</p>

        <figcaption>The resulting photos are stunning (Picture: <a href="https://loveandwolves.co/">LOVE + WOLVES CO</a> )</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>There were challenges, of course. There was no functioning kitchen, everything the couple needed had to be brought to the island by ferry, and most of the locations for photos had no power, meaning the photographer, Jake of <a href="https://loveandwolves.co/">LOVE + WOLVES CO</a>, had to make do with shining flashlights and flinging open doors.</p>
      <p>At a time when no one was around, in places that were in the midst of renovation, the ceremony, reception, and the photoshoot truly were a once in a lifetime experience.</p>
      <p>‘Our friends still talk about it to this day,’ Taylor said. ‘The intimacy and location were perfect.</p>
      <p>‘It’s not common to get an island in NY all to yourself for one evening.’</p>
