      <h1>Egypt unveils animal mummies of lion cubs, crocodiles, birds</h1>

      <p>Egypt’s Ministry of Antiquities is revealing details on recently discovered animal mummies, saying they contain two lion cubs as well as several crocodiles, birds and cats.</p>
      <p>The November 23 announcement came during an exhibition at the famed Step Pyramid in Saqqara, south of Cairo. That’s near where the mummies and other objects were found in a vast necropolis.</p>
      <p>Archaeologists frequently find mummified cats, but the recovery of a lion is rare. The ministry says the animal mummies are all from the Late Period (664-332 B.C.).</p>
      <p>The ministry had announced last week it was running scans to determine that the mummies were indeed lions.</p>
      <p>Egypt has stepped up promotion of its archaeological treasures in hopes of reviving a tourism sector slow to recover from the 2011 uprising that toppled long-time autocrat Hosni Mubarak.</p>
