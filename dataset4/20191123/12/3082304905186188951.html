        <b>Lucas Torreira “needs to improve” but is sure to be an important player for Arsenal, according to head coach Unai Emery.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Unai Emery insists Lucas Torreira has a bright future at Arsenal despite the midfielder’s apparent disapproval of his new role in midfield.</p>
      <p>Torreira impressed last season but has started just four of 12 Premier League matches this term amid rumoured transfer interest from AC Milan and Napoli.</p>
      <p>His agent, Pablo Bentancur, recently admitted the tenacious Uruguayan was unhappy with having to playing higher up the pitch than usual.</p>
      <p>Emery thinks Torreira must hone his tactical nous to be suitable for the base of midfield but still expects him to enjoy a long and fruitful career in north London.</p>
      <p>“He is a very good player, important for us, and his focus needs to be with us 100 per cent,” Emery said.</p>
      <p>“He has very big commitment and very good behaviour. He has a very big future here but he needs to improve. He has to learn in some situations, individually to help us, to do better. It’s one process.”</p>

      <p>Torreira started the club’s last fixture before the international break, a 2-0 loss to Leicester City, but faces a fight to hold his spot for Saturday’s match against Southampton as Granit Xhaka returns to selection contention.</p>
      <p>Emery hopes video analysis sessions will strengthen the 23-year-old’s understanding of what Arsenal require in the engine room.</p>
      <p>“He played well last year but this year he’s not being consistent,” the Gunners boss said.</p>
      <p>“My challenge to him is to improve, to do better with some tactical issues on the pitch and above all be consistent.</p>
      <p>“I spoke with him on Wednesday and Thursday. I showed him some movies about his best performances with us and how he can improve.</p>
      <p>“He is young, his process here is starting and he started playing in the Premier League last year and he progressed, but this year again he needs to progress.”</p>
