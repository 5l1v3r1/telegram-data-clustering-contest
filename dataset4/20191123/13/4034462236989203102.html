      <h1>There's A Petition Asking Ford To Change Mustang Mach-E Name</h1>
      <h2>Good luck with that.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:15:33+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author">Roger Biermann</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/mach-e">Ford Mustang Mach-E</a> has divided internet opinion since it leaked last week and was revealed a few days later. The Mach-E moniker wasn't the contentious issue, but rather that many didn't agree with it being an electric crossover SUV. In fact, even Bill Ford didn't agree with the name until after he'd driven the prototypes, after which he gave the E-Stang his blessing. But there are other Mustang experts who aren't as quick to agree, and one, in particular, is vehemently against the idea. Mustang author, Jimmy Dinsmore has started a petition demanding that Ford change the EV crossover's name.</p>

      <p>Dinsmore is a well known automotive journalist, but that's not what qualifies him to have a say on the matter. He's also an author and co-wrote Mustang by Design, a book that details the original Mustang's development way back in the early 1960s when the name and model quite literally birthed the classification of the pony car. He's somewhat of a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/mustang">Ford Mustang</a> historian, which gives his opinion some weight.</p>
      <p>What's most interesting is that Dinsmore doesn't abhor the idea of an electric vehicle carrying the Mustang name and badge. He says electrification is not the issue with the Mustang Mach-E, but rather putting the name on something that isn't a true pony car; the way it was originally intended. According to Dinsmore, it was always designed as a two-door, low slung, short-deck, long-hood muscle car - not a generic crossover that every Tom, Dick, or Harry is driving. In the petition, he even goes on to quote Le Iacocca in saying, "The Mustang is a wild horse, not a domesticated racer," indicating why the Mustang logo faces left instead of traditional racing horses running to the right.</p>

      <p>Those are strong words, and he didn't hide his opinion either on a recent rant on Facebook. We can't say we disagree entirely, either. Electrification is quickly proving to be the way of the future, so it's inevitable that hallowed performance nameplates will eventually become associated with electric power. But the Mustang and the pony car class it gave rise to have always been 2+2 seat, two-door rear-wheel-drive coupes; the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/camaro">Chevrolet Camaro</a> and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/dodge/challenger-r-t">Dodge Challenger</a> still stay true to this ethos. The Mustang name has had less to do with powertrain than body style and drivetrain, after all, the current generation <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/ford-mustang-svo-name-ditched-for-obvious-reason">isn't the first time we've seen turbo four-cylinders beneath the hood</a> of the pony car.</p>

      <p>Dismore has started an online petition to Ford to change the name of the Mach-E. The Change.org petition states, "The Ford Mustang Mach E should have the Mustang name and logo removed from it. It goes against the essence of what Mustang stands for in automotive history. It's insulting to the tens of thousands of Mustang enthusiasts who love the Pony Car and support Ford." It goes on further, but what's most surprising, and perhaps pleasing, is that in a few days the petition has amassed more than 8,300 signatures and the numbers are climbing rapidly.</p>
      <p>The only question is, are you going to be one of those signing the petition?</p>
