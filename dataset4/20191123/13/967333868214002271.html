        <b>BEIJING (Sputnik) - China on Saturday successfully launched into the orbit the 50th and 51st satellites of its BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, China Aerospace and Technology Corporation (CASC) said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The launch was carried out at 08:55 a.m. local time (12:55 GMT) from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southern Sichuan province, using a Chang Zheng-3B carrier rocket.</p>
      <p>CASC noted that once the satellites reached the orbit and passed necessary tests, they would become part of the navigation system.</p>
      <p>The BeiDou system is <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201909231076865754-china-launches-another-2-satellites-of-beidou-navigation-system---aerospace-corporation/">designed as a rival to GPS in the United States</a>, GLONASS in Russia and Galileo in the European Union. Beijing plans that the system will offer its services worldwide by 2020.</p>
      <p>This was the 319th mission for the Chang Zheng family of launch vehicles.</p>
