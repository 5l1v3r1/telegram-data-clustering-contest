      <p>The ED on Friday (22 November) said that it has arrested Bhushan Steel and Power Ltd's former CMD Sanjay Singal in connection with a money laundering probe.</p>
      <p>"Singal was arrested under the charges of Prevention of Money Laundering Act," an ED official told IANS, adding that he had not been cooperating with the ED during questioning.</p>
      <p>Singal will be produced before a court here on Saturday (23 November) to seek further custody, the official said.</p>
      <p>The ED has recently attached assets worth Rs 4,025 crore of Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL).</p>
      <p>"An amount of Rs 695.14 crore was introduced as capital by Singal (then CMD of the company) and his family members in BPSL out of artificially generated long-term capital gains by diversion of bank loans fund of BPSL," the ED had said earlier.</p>
