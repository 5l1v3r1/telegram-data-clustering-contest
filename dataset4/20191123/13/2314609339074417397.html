      <h1>'A tsunami of traffic': Bunnings megastore divides inner Sydney suburb</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Megan Gorrey</a></address>
      <p>Residents of an inner Sydney suburb will soon be able to partake in a sausage sizzle at their own Bunnings store, but they will have to navigate the streets near one of the city's busiest intersections to do so.</p>
      <p>Bunnings' long-running ambition to build a store in an industrial pocket of Rozelle, near White Bay Power Station and Victoria Road, hit a snag when the plans were refused by the Inner West Council.</p>

      <p>But the NSW Land and Environment Court paved the way for the hardware giant's $11 million project to go ahead when it <a href="https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/5dcb748fe4b0c3247d712eab">approved the controversial development bid</a> last week, subject to conditions.</p>
      <p>The proposal, lodged by Artazan Property Group, sought permission to demolish buildings at the Parsons Street site to construct a three-storey warehouse, barbecue area and 74 car-parking spaces.</p>
      <p>But local opponents fighting the plan were concerned the store would operate for long hours, drive down residential property prices and worsen traffic conditions in the already-congested area.</p>
      <p>The mayor of the Inner West, Darcy Byrne, said traffic near the future Bunnings store – which is close to the intersection of The Crescent and Victoria Road – was set to ramp up due to major infrastructure projects including the WestConnex Rozelle Interchange and the Iron Cove Bridge.</p>
      <p>"It's only a few hundred metres from all the WestConnex stage three construction sites and it brings that congestion to the other side of Victoria Road," Cr Byrne said. "The traffic's already failing there.</p>
      <p>"You could describe it as a perfect storm but it's more like a tsunami of traffic that's going to be created around central Rozelle."</p>
      <p>Despite the council's concerns about the store's potential to exacerbate traffic conditions in the area, particularly on weekends, Cr Byrne said not everyone who lived in the area was against the plan.</p>

      <p>"I suspect there will be people who like the idea of a Bunnings in their suburb. There are always heaps of renovations going on in the area," he said.</p>
      <p>Bunnings wanted the store to open from 6am to 10pm during the week, while the council called for shorter trading hours. The court suggested hours of 7am to 9pm at the latest on weekdays and Saturdays and from 8am to 6pm on Sundays would be reasonable.</p>
      <p>Delivery trucks will be limited to 15 per day, and 20 trucks per day during December. Bunnings said it was "pleased" with the court's ruling and will work with the developer to satisfy the conditions.</p>
      <p>But Balmain MP Jamie Parker said that "enforcing [the conditions] is next to impossible".</p>
      <p>"While the community did manage to get some changes that would reduce the impact of the development, it's still an overdevelopment," he said.</p>
      <p>He said the megastore also threatened to "destroy the independent hardware stores in the area".</p>
      <p>"The community wanted a redevelopment of the site but this is basically a retail business in an industrial area."</p>
