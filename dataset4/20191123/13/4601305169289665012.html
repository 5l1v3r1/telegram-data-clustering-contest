      <p>I knew about <a href="https://medium.com/@blazenhoff/adventures-in-blazenpuff-stoned-yoga-399dcaf0eb5"><i>stoned </i>yoga</a> but I'm just learning about <i>drunk </i>yoga. The <a href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2019-11-22/drunk-yoga-you-know-you-want-to-try-it"><i>Los Angeles Times</i></a> is reporting that there are exercise classes where you can also get your drink on (specifically, wine):</p>
