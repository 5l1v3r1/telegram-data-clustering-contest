      <h1>Nawaz Sharif seeks exemption from personal appearance in hearing of plea against conviction in Al-Azizia case</h1>

      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Former premier Nawaz Sharif on Saturday has sought exemption from his personal appearance in the hearing of an application against his conviction in the Al-Azizia Reference case.</p>
      <p>Advocate Ghulam Subhani filed the application on Sharif’s behalf in the Islamabad High Court (IHC), pleading with the court to grant exemption to his client for the hearing on Nov. 25.</p>
      <p>It said that advocate Ibrahim Haroon would appear in the courtroom for representing Sharif. The court has been informed that Sharif has left the country with an order of the Lahore High Court (LHC).</p>
      <p>On Nov. 19, the 69-year-old PML-N supremo, who has bail in two corruption cases and is facing another reference by the National Accountability Bureau, left for London, 20 days after he was released on bail from a seven-year sentence for corruption. He was accompanied to the airport by a large number of supporters as well as party leaders.</p>
      <p>His departure came a day after the interior ministry issued a notification, allowing him to travel abroad for medical treatment, saying that the decision was an "interim arrangement" in light of the LHC’s order.</p>
      <p>In its notification, the ministry reproduced the undertakings provided by Shehbaz Sharif and Nawaz to the LHC in which the terms of their travel and return have been laid out.</p>
      <p>The verdict was issued after Nawaz signed a court-approved undertaking, saying that he would return to the country within four weeks.</p>
      <p>Nawaz was granted bail by the Islamabad High Court on humanitarian grounds, in the Al Azizia case earlier this month. He also obtained bail in the ongoing Chaudhry Sugar Mills case, in which he is a suspect, from the LHC.</p>
