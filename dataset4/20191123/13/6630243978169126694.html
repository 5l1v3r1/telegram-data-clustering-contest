        <b>Egyptian antiquities authorities uncovered a large cache of mummified animals and what they say is the world’s largest scarab beetle at the ancient Saqarra necropolis, south of Cairo on Saturday (November 23).</b>
      </p>
      <p>The discovery, made last year by an Egyptian archaeological mission uncovered a cache housing ancient artefacts including masks, statues and mummified cats, crocodiles, cobras and birds.</p>
      <p>Secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, Mostafa Waziri who led the mission, said they also uncovered a tomb belonging to a fifth dynasty royal priest ‘Wahtye’.</p>
      <aside>The discovery included around 75 wooden and bronze statues of cats.</aside>
      <p>Waziri also said that CT scans done on five of the biggest mummified cats revealed that there is a strong likelihood they are lion cubs, according to the size and shape of the bones.</p>
      <p>Minister of Antiquities Khaled al-Anany also said that French Egyptologist Alain Zivie had previously discovered a skeleton of a lion in the area.</p>
      <p>The discovery included around 75 wooden and bronze statues of cats.</p>
      <p>Saqqara served as the necropolis for Memphis, the capital of ancient Egypt for more than two millennia.</p>
      <p>Ancient Egyptians mummified humans to preserve their bodies for the afterlife, while animal mummies were used as religious offerings.</p>
