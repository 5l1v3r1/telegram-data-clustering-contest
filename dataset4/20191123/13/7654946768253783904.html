      <p>Babbel is the world’s #1 top-grossing language learning app because it focuses on conversational training, rather than redundant vocabulary. In other words, you’ll learn how to speak confidently about practical, everyday topics like dining, transportation, directions, making friends, and more. Its main goal is to help you get around a new country, converse with locals, and actually retain a lasting familiarity with a new language. And to ensure you’ll follow through, the curriculum is broken down into bite-sized lessons you can complete in just 15 minutes on the go and whenever you want.</p>
      <p>You can choose from 14 different languages, and the interactive speech recognition technology will help you get your pronunciation on point. Plus, the personalized review sessions will help reinforce what you’ve learned along the way.</p>
