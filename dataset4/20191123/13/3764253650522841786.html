      <p>Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has reportedly ended his plans to sell the Premier League side following Frank Lampard and his wards' superb performance this season.</p>
      <p>There have been reports that the Russian billionaire has been looking for interested buyer for the Blues in the region of Â£3 billion.</p>
      <p>Britain's richest man, Sir Jim Ratcliffe was also linked with buying Chelsea earlier this year, but there was no concrete agreement between him and and the Blues chiefs.</p>
      <p>Roman Abramovich was reported then to be livid after his United Kingdom's visa was withdrawn which forced him to take Israeli citizenship.</p>

      <p>According to the report by Telegraph, Roman Abramovich is happy with Chelsea's game this season and has changed his mind to support Lampard and his men.</p>
      <p>Lampard started his reign at Chelsea with a defeat at Manchester United, but the Blues later found their rhythm this term.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Chelsea are currently occupying third position on the Premier League standings with 26 points after 12 games.</p>
      <p>Earlier, <b>Legit.ng</b> had reported how current Chelsea manager Frank Lampard made it clear that he would never manage<a href="https://www.legit.ng/1278343-frank-lampard-manage-tottenham-hiring-mourinho.html"> Premier League side Tottenham</a> after the club hired the Blues legend Jose Mourinho.</p>
