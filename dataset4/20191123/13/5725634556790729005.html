      <h1>Seadrill: Another Debt Restructuring In The Making, But Don't Bet On Bankruptcy This Time</h1>

      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Briefly discussing highlights from the company's Q3/2019 report. Company recorded another $300+ million impairment charge on its stake in Seadrill Partners.</li>
        <li>Chairman John Fredriksen resigned, effective immediately.</li>
        <li>On the conference call, management openly admitted to a slower than expected industry recovery resulting in the likely requirement to restructure the company's debt a second time.</li>
        <li>Discussing the possibility of an out-of-court restructuring given the company's lender structure and its vested interest in avoiding debt equitization.</li>
        <li>Much depends on how the company will deal with the remaining outstanding bonds but there's a decent chance for some of the company's equity to survive the upcoming debt restructuring this time.</li>
      </ul>

          <i>Note:</i>

      </p>
      <p><i>I have covered Seadrill (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SDRL">SDRL</a>) previously, so investors should view this as an update to my</i> <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/author/henrik-alex/articles#regular_articles&amp;ticker=sdrl"><i>earlier articles</i></a> <i>on the company.</i></p>
      <p>On Thursday, leading offshore driller Seadrill Limited reported <a href="https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/89591cf0-170a-4b78-8869-7585198ec7cf">Q3/2019 results</a> which have been already <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4308224-seadrill-john-fredriksen-leaves-board-seadrill-partners-brings-another-impairment">discussed</a> in great detail by fellow contributor <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/author/vladimir-zernov">Vladimir Zernov</a>.</p>
      <p>Adjusted for higher client reimbursables, results came in largely in line with expectations but Q4 will mark a very meaniungful stepdown in revenues and EBITDA.</p>
      <p>That said, the release included two major standouts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>John Fredriksen resigned from the chairman post, effective immediately.</li>
        <li>The company recorded a $302 million impairment on its stake in subsidiary Seadrill Partners.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Note that Seadrill Partners is facing $2.9 billion in near-term debt maturities and has already commenced discussions with lenders. Previously, I <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235330-seadrill-potential-debt-restructuring-seadrill-partners-major-blow?source=all_articles_title">considered it unlikely</a> for Seadrill to simply give up on its material economic interest in Seadrill Partners' modern floater fleet but neither Seadrill's nor Seadrill Partners' earnings releases and subsequent conference calls contained any hint to Seadrill's intentions to deal with the issue. As a result, I now tend to assume that Seadrill might indeed abandon its stake in Seadrill Partners and give up on the jointly owned rigs in the subsidiary's upcoming restructuring.</p>
      <p>In sum, the company continues to have ample liquidity and the ability to defer $500 million or up to five quarters of scheduled debt amortization payments starting in Q1/2020. But debt amortization will kick back in during Q2/2021 and Seadrill will have to finally deal with debt maturities starting in 2022 and escalating in 2023, quite similar to most of its peers.</p>

      <p>On the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4308339-seadrill-limited-sdrl-ceo-anton-dibowitz-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript">conference call</a>, CEO Anton Dibowitz made no attempt to dance around the issue any longer and openly admitted to current and future industry challenges (emphasis added by author):</p>
      <blockquote><i>We remain focused on the things that we can control, but we cannot turn a blind eye to what the market is telling us and the state of the industry more generally. The good news, which I will talk about in a moment is that we continue to see signs of a recovery in the market. The bad news is that it is quite clear that this recovery is taking longer than anyone expected.</i> <i>After the worst downturn in 25 years, <b>the recovery has not met the expectations of many, including ourselves</b>. <b>On top of this, the industry faces mounting debt maturities over the next five years that present significant challenges to us, our competitors, and our collective lending groups.</b></i></blockquote>
      <p>In fact, the company has already started discussions with lenders:</p>
      <blockquote>We have a supportive and homogenous bank group that we can work with to address medium and longer term capital structure requirements. We are being proactive in this regard. Having met with each bank individually to ensure that is clearly understood that early and transparent engagement is our preferred route to jointly ensure long-term sustainability.</blockquote>
      <p>Suffice to say, the company will have to execute on another debt restructuring in the not too distant future as the industry recovery has so far failed to get the traction required for lenders to consider extending or refinancing debt ahead of schedule.</p>
      <p>That said, I wouldn't necessarily bet on the company filing for bankruptcy protection a second time. After having equitized all of its legacy bond debt upon emergence from bankruptcy in early 2018, the vast majority of Seadrill's approximately $6.9 billion in debt obligations is with its long-standing bank consortium while the remainder relates to the company's 12% 2025 senior secured notes issued to legacy bondholders in conjunction with the company's 2018 debt restructuring.</p>
      <p>Filing for bankruptcy a second time within just three years without the intent to eliminate a significant portion of the company's bank debt would almost certainly result in the bankruptcy court rejecting the plan of reorganization, even if agreed to by a supermajority of lenders.</p>
      <p>So, if the company's banks are indeed looking to kick the can further down the road, they will likely try to avoid filing for bankruptcy protection.</p>
      <p>Admittedly, an out-of-court restructuring appears to be a Herculean task, particularly in case of Seadrill with dozens of banks being involved and a high-yield bond still outstanding as virtually all lenders would be required to be on board in this case.</p>
      <p>That said, there are ways to deal with dissenting lenders:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Bank consortium members could agree to take over tranches from existing lenders finally looking to end their exposure to the ailing company and perhaps the industry as a whole.</li>
        <li>Seadrill, potentially with the support of its banks, could launch a tender offer for the remaining, approximately $550 million in senior secured notes currently trading at approximately 88% of face value.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, the company could offer a debt-for-equity exchange for the senior secured notes.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The big question is to what extent Seadrill's leading banks would indeed consider increasing their exposure only to bail out dissenting consortium members. In addition, the company will likely have to deal with the usual number of holdouts rejecting a potential note tender offer.</p>
      <p>Personally, I consider both problems as manageable as it is in the vested interest of the company's banks to simply kick the can further down the road, further collecting juicy amendment fees and interest payments this way while patiently waiting for the industry recovery to finally gain some real traction.</p>
      <p>The biggest problem, apparently, will be to deal with the senior secured notes but the company seems to be well aware of the issue as it has already reduced the outstanding amount of the bonds by more than $300 million in a recent tender offer and on the conference call actually reiterated its intent to repay more of the notes ahead of maturity:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>In terms of capital structure, it remains our priority to focus on the continued pay down of the NSNs where feasible.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So, what does this mean for the company's badly stricken equityholders?</p>
      <p>To be fair, one can only speculate at this point as another debt restructuring would be highly unlikely to leave shareholders unscathed. While banks are not necessarily eager to become equityholders, some noteholders might actually have a different approach. Much depends on how the remaining senior secured notes will be addressed going forward. Should the bonds indeed end up being equitized, current common shareholders will likely face major dilution and might actually end up with just a token recovery once again. But if a meaningful amount gets taken out against cash, some or even a majority of the common equity might indeed survive this time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bottom Line:</b>
      </p>
      <p>After listening to many of the company's peers talking its book again in recent conference calls, I very much enjoyed Seadrill management's straightforwardness regarding the slower than expected recovery pace and the upcoming debt wall for the industry.</p>
      <p>There's no denial, Seadrill will have to restructure its debt again in the not too distant future.</p>
      <p>That said, this time might be different as it remains the vested interest of the company's banks to kick the can further down the road thus collecting juicy amendment fees and interest payments rather than facing the bankruptcy court potentially requiring them to equitize large parts of their credit exposure this time.</p>
      <p>Particularly in Seadrill's case, an out-of-court restructuring might be a viable option to extend the company's runway until the industry recovery has finally gained some much-needed steam.</p>
      <p>Even if the company avoids filing for bankruptcy protection a second time, the fate of common equityholders remains unclear as much depends on Seadrill's approach to deal with the remaining senior secured notes.</p>
      <p>In sum, I wouldn't bet on a wipe-out this time. Should the company indeed manage to remain out of court and address the senior secured notes without a major debt-for-equity exchange, a meaningful part of Seadrill's equity might indeed survive the upcoming debt restructuring.</p>
      <p>Make no mistake, this is an ultra-high risk / high reward situation. After all, the company might still end up in bankruptcy with a wipe-out basically a given in this case. Only the most speculative investors might consider taking a small bet here.</p>
