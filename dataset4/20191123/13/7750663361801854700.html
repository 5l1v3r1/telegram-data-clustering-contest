      <p>The Dane, as things stand, will leave Spurs for free at the end of the season after failing to agree fresh terms with Tottenham.</p>

      <p>According to <i>Corriere dello Sport</i>, Mourinho will not stand in the way of Eriksen's departure if that continues to be the player's preference.</p>
