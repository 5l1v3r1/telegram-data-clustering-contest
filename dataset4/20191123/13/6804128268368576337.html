      <h1>'Unbelievable!' Tottenham great and pundits hail Dele Alli for what he did vs West Ham</h1>
      <h2>Dele Alli produced a sublime moment of skill for Tottenham at West Ham United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:57:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:57</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham great Glenn Hoddle has hailed Dele Alli's huge contribution in Jose Mourinho's first game in charge.</p>
      <p>Spurs led 2-0 at the break thanks to goals from Son Heung-min and Lucas Moura, with Alli assisting the first and then playing a key role in the second.</p>
      <p>Alli cleverly stopped the ball from going out of play in the build-up to Moura's goal, with the England international then putting the ball into the path of Son thanks to a nice flick whilst he was sat on the field.</p>
      <p>Son then produced fine cross for Moura to make it 2-0 and it led to reaction aplenty.</p>
      <p>"It was two wonderful flicks from Alli and Son. It was a wonderful bit of skill off the floor from Alli and then a super cross from Son," Hoddle explained during commentary on BT Sport.</p>
      <p>"Here is the build-up and there is the brilliant flick from Dele Alli while he's on the floor. The ball just doesn't go out of play.</p>
      <p>"It was a great cross and there is the desire from Lucas Moura to get to the ball and finish it off."</p>
      <p>BT Sport pundits Joe Cole and Peter Crouch also shared their views on Alli's improved performance.</p>
      <p>Crouch said: "It feels like he is playing without shackles. This (flick on the floor) was unbelievable. There will be memes all over the place on that."</p>
