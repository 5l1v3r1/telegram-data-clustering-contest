      <p>US Central Command chief General Kenneth McKenzie stated Saturday that <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911061077237618-withdrawal-huh-at-least-800-us-soldiers-reportedly-to-remain-in-syria-to-secure-its-oil-fields/">some 500 US personnel still remained in eastern Syria</a> in order to take part in the upcoming anti-Daesh operation in the region.</p>
      <p>US President Donald Trump announced early in October his intention to bring the US troops stationed in Syria "back home," though weeks later the US announced they it would keep a small number of troops in the area to "protect the oil fields."</p>
      <p>The decision was made amid another noteworthy occasion - <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911191077352376-baghdadi-death-unlikely-to-impact-daesh-ability-to-rebuild---pentagon-inspector-general/">the death of former Daesh leader</a> Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who blew himself up along with two children on 26 October when he was cornered by the US military in his hideout in northern Syria.</p>
      <p>The group confirmed the death of al-Baghdadi, naming Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurayshi their new leader.</p>
