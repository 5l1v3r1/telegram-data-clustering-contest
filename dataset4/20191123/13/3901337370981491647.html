      <p>Mourinho was appointed new Spurs boss on Thursday, replacing the outgoing Mauricio Pochettino who had been relieved of his duties following a poor run of form. </p>
      <p>The Tottenham job is the Portuguese tactician's fourth in the Premier League, following two stints with London rivals Chelsea and one with Manchester United, the latter of which was his most recent, and he was recently asked if it would be his last in England.</p>
      <p>“I would love that to be the case. I would love to stay for many years," Mourinho said, as reported by <i>FourFourTwo.</i></p>

      <p>“I say many years but I know realistically how football is.</p>
      <p>Mourinho also revealed that he hopes to emulate his predecessor's time at the club, before returning to Portugal where he could retire at home-town club Vitoria Setubal.</p>
      <p>“If I could do a Mauricio for five-and-a-half years, it would be amazing. I would be 61 – then 10 more years. Vitoria Setubal in Portugal maybe the last job, the 56-year-old added. </p>
