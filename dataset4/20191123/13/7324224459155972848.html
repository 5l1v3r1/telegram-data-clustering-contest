      <p>Middlesbrough boss Jonathan Woodgate said it was time his side repaid the club’s fans by ending their nine-game winless run.</p>
      <p>Boro will be bidding for their first Sky Bet Championship victory since mid-September against Hull at the Riverside on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“We need to start winning football games, there’s no getting away from that and we’ve got a big game against Hull at the weekend, which we need to win,” Woodgate told a press conference.</p>
      <p>“We need to start winning games to get more fans in the stadium. They’ve been very patient so far, very good.</p>
      <p>“I can’t thank them enough really for the patience they’ve given us, so we need to start repaying them with wins.”</p>
      <p>Woodgate, whose side sit third from bottom in the table, is hopeful defender George Friend will be fit.</p>
      <p>Rudy Gestede, Ryan Shotton and Marcus Browne remain sidelined through injury and George Saville is suspended.</p>
      <p>Hull are nine points and 10 places better off than Boro. Their recent away form – they have won have won three of their last four on the road – has lifted them  to within six points of the play-off places.</p>
      <p>“It’s all about playing with a no-fear approach and making sure we can go to any team in this league and get a result,” boss Grant McCann told a press conference.</p>
      <p>“That’s the way we approach every game. Every game is tough at this level, but we’ve got a belief in what we do.”</p>
      <p>Stephen Kingsley, Norbert Balogh and Jon Toral are still out and Josh Magennis serves the final game of a four-match ban.</p>
