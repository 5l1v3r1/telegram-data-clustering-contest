        <b>Latest news from the rest of this afternoon's card at Haydock as Thebannerkingrebel impressed enough to be cut in price for the Sky Bet Supreme at Cheltenham.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Banner cut for Sky Bet Supreme</h3>
      <p>Jamie Snowden described <b>Thebannerkingrebel</b> as "a bit of a freak" after the six-year-old got back to winning ways in the Read Paul Nicholls Exclusively At Betfair Newton Novices' Hurdle at Haydock.</p>
      <p>This was a retrieval mission for Snowden's charge following his final flight fall when holding every chance at Wetherby three weeks ago - and Thebannerkingrebel redeemed himself to stake an early claim for the Cheltenham Festival.</p>
      <p>Leading after three out, he hit he second last, but it did not stop his momentum - and, after a fine leap over the final obstacle, the 5/4 favourite went on to win by five lengths from Calva D'Auge under Gavin Sheehan.</p>
      <p>"It was a real shame at Wetherby, but it did him no harm because he's jumped really cleanly today. I know he clipped the second last out of the ground, but on the whole he's made a far better shape over his hurdles and he's quickened away in the manner of a good horse," said Snowden.</p>
      <p>"He's got a serious engine - he's a bit of a freak. He's got gears, he can go a good gallop and he can quicken off it. I think he's very good.</p>
      <p>"His wind was really bad after the Cheltenham bumper (in 2018) and he had a year off. I thought the horse had gone, but finally all came right.</p>
      <p>"We gave him a couple of easy runs over hurdles at Warwick and Newton Abbot and came back to Wetherby, where he looked the winner jumping the last, and then came here today.</p>
      <p>"There's the Rossington Main back here. I know it's a fair way away, but that's what I've got my eyes on.</p>
      <p>"It would be nice to have that as a springboard to Cheltenham. We'd have to think Supreme (Novices' Hurdle)."</p>
      <p>The sponsors cut Thebannerkingrebel to 20/1 from 40s for the Sky Bet Supreme Novices' Hurdle in March.</p>
      <p>Spokesman Michael Shinners said: "That was a very impressive performance and he looks a very useful performer.</p>
      <p>"Todayâ€™s race looked a decent one and it will be interesting to see where he goes next. It would be great to see him in our trial for the race back at Haydock in January."</p>
