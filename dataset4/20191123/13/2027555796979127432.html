      <h1>Hope India play a day/night Test in Adelaide: Warne</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:18:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>With India's first-ever Day/Night Test underway, Australian spin legend Shane Warne is hoping Virat Kohli and his men will agree to play with the pink ball when they tour Australia next year.</p>
      <p>The second Test between India and Bangladesh, which started in Kolkata on Friday, saw the two teams playing with the pink ball for the first time.</p>
      <p>Warne congratulated the new BCCI President Sourav Ganguly and skipper Kohli for taking the initiative.</p>
      <p>"Congrats to you and @imVkohli on agreeing to play a day/night test. I hope there's another one next summer in Adelaide when India tour Australia on @FoxCricket - Would be amazing buddy!," Warne wrote replying to Ganguly's tweet.</p>
      <p>Former England captain Michael Vaughan was also quick to congratulate Ganguly.</p>
      <p>"Well done Sourav .. look forward to a couple in Aussie next winter," Vaughan tweeted.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week Kohli had said he is open to the idea of Day/Night Test in Australia next year provided his team is allocated a practice match, something which wasn't on the table during the 2017-18 tour Down Under.</p>
      <p>India are scheduled to play a four-match Test series in Australia starting in November next year.</p>
