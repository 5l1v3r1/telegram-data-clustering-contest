      <h1>Sheffield United to make late fitness call on John Egan tomorrow</h1>

        <b>Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder says they'll give Republic of Ireland defender John Egan every chance to prove his fitness ahead of tomorrow's Premier League clash with Manchester United.Â </b>
      </p>
      <p>"We're going to give him every chance and leave it until the last minute," Wilder said of Egan's fitness after he picked up a calf strain in Ireland's 1-1 draw with Denmark on Monday.</p>
      <p>"Manchester United are one of the most iconic teams in the world, and there will always be an aura surrounding them.</p>
      <p>"No matter how their fortunes on the pitch may fluctuate, it's still one of football's true powerhouses that we are talking about whenever we mention their name.</p>
      <p>"They are an incredible football club who are just going through a spell right now where they are not having it all their own way.</p>
      <p>"That happens in football. But fortunes can fluctuate very quickly in this game and they will find their way back to the top, that's for certain."</p>
      <p>"I think they've just won five of their last six games and won three away on the bounce last month, so I think that answers the question.</p>
      <p>"This is still Manchester United. They still have world class players. We went over there to play a training match a few weeks ago and I think my players were surprised at the quality of the team they decided to put out for the game.</p>
      <p>"And then they brought on a load of talented, young whipper-snappers towards the end when our players were tired. So we know the quality they have right through the squad and we know what to expect."</p>
