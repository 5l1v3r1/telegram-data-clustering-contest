      <h1>Kim Kardashian 'cried whole way home' she was compared to Mrs Doubtfire at Met Gala</h1>
      <h2>Kim Kardashian was heavily pregnant with her first child, North, when she wore the fitted floral-print gown</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> has revealed that she "cried the whole way home" after seeing cruel memes about her first <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-gala">Met Gala</a> look.</p>
      <p>Kim was pregnant with her first child, North, at the time and felt incredibly insecure because she felt like nobody wanted her there.</p>
      <p>In a new video for Vogue, the star reflected on some of her best and worst outfits to date – including that floral-print gown.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians">Keeping Up With The Kardashians</a> star flaunted her baby bump in floral-print gown to her first Met Gala back in 2013.</p>

      <p>The 39-year-old said: “I was very pregnant, very puffy and bloated and I was like, ‘Oh god, of course the first time I go I’m gonna be huge.”</p>
      <p>“ <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kanye-west">Kanye</a> was performing so I wasn’t actually invited, I was just Kanye’s plus one. And that was okay with me because I never really dreamed I would be at the Met Ball.</p>
      <p>"I know no one really probably wanted me there at the time.”</p>
      <p>When it came time to choosing the perfect outfit to make her debut, Kardashian West says then-Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci — who was also dressing West — kept her growing bump in mind.</p>

      <p>Kim revealed she actually wanted to wear a black version of the dress – but was convinced otherwise.</p>
      <p>“We chose a really stretchy fabric because I would be growing and we wanted to make sure that alterations were easy and it was comfortable,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I was like, ‘I think I should just do the black version,’ and Riccardo was like, ‘No, c’mon, we have to do the floral,’” she explained, adding the the designer later gave a sweet explanation for his choice. “Riccardo said afterwards, ‘What do you give a woman who is pregnant? You send her flowers.’”</p>

      <p>“But I was so insecure. I could never really speak up at that point because I so shy and just wanted to make everybody happy,” she recalled.</p>
      <p>After Kim and Kanye walked the red carpet, people quickly started criticising her outfit, and compared her dress to an old floral couch or curtains.</p>

      <p>“I think <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/robin-williams">Robin Williams</a> even tweeted it, said I looked like Mrs. Doubtfire,” she said. “I was crying the whole way home because I just couldn’t believe it.”</p>
      <p>Fortunately, there were two very important people who did like Kardashian West’s outfit right away: Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen.</p>
      <p>“I just remember the Olsen twins came up to me and loved my outfit and my gloves, so none of the critics mattered because the Olsen twins approved,” the reality star added, saying that now that time has passed, she also loves the look. “Now it’s like sick,” she said.</p>
