      <p>It is considered one of the bloodiest attacks on the media in the world: a massacre that saw 58 people killed, including 32 journalists.</p>
      <p>It happened in the Philippines on November 23, 2009; on Saturday, activists and media workers marked the 10-year anniversary.</p>
      <p>The journalists were travelling with a local politician when they were ambushed and killed by armed men in the province of Maguindanao.</p>
      <p>The media workers were later found in a mass grave.</p>
      <p>The case against the suspected masterminds of the massacre, the patriarchs of Maguindanao's local political clan Ampatuan, has dragged on for 10 years.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for the families of the 58 massacre victims said a verdict is expected to be given before the end of 2019.</p>
