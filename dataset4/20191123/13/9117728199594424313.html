      <p>Mercedes have wrapped up yet another driver and constructor double, their sixth in a row. With the season finale in Abu Dhabi just around the corner Mercedes will be wanting to bounce back and Hakkinen expects Mercedes to do exactly that.</p>
      <p><i>“We are now going to the final race in Abu Dhabi, back to sea level,"</i> Hakkinen said in his column for <a href="https://www.unibet.co.uk/blog/motorsports/formula-1/mika-hakkinen-verstappen-will-take-it-to-the-max-in-abu-dhabi-in-the-season-finale-1.1313703">Unibet</a>.</p>

        <i>"I expect Mercedes to be at full strength again. Fully competitive against Ferrari and Red Bull. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Everyone will go for it this last race. Without championships that are fast and only want the professional satisfaction of the best. It should be fantastic."</i>
