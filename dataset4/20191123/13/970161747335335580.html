      <p>Prepare to be 100% that festive b*tch. Lizzo, the legend behind feel-good anthem Truth Hurts, has been immortalised in <a href="https://www.notjustclothing.co.uk/collections/uk-range-non-stc/products/dat-b-tch_done?variant=31073033355343">a glorious Christmas jumper.</a></p>
      <p>The festive knit features flutes, juice boxes and strands of DNA to pay homage to the iconic opening line of ‘<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/24/lizzo-shares-songwriting-credit-truth-hurts-meme-tweeter-amid-plagiarism-row-10973850/">Truth Hurts</a>. And if you didn’t catch it, there’s also an image of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/27/lizzo-makes-me-proud-to-be-a-plus-size-black-woman-10639521/">Lizzo</a> herself plus the text: ‘100% dat Christmas B*tch’.</p>
      <p>Just <i>think</i> about how many elderly relatives and pop culture shy cousins will ask you what the heck that’s about over Christmas dinner. It’s the gift that keeps on giving!</p>

      <p>Notjust aims to make‘the world better with a sweater’ with donations from sales being used to reach a donation goal of £50,000 for Save the Children.</p>
      <p>‘All money raised could help give a child living in a refugee camp clothes to keep them warm through winter, help buy nutritious food for their entire family, or set up a safe space to give children the chance to be children again,’ said Sarah Button-Stephens, campaign manager for Christmas Jumper Day.</p>
      <p>‘It could also help bring essentials like healthcare, education, protection, and food to the millions of children around the world who are missing out on the most basic support.’</p>
      <p>The unisex jumpers range from £32.99-£39.99 and are available in sizes from XS-XXL.</p>
