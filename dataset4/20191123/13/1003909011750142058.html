      <h3>Double standards of democracy</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: Bill to oust election commissioner passes in Alberta legislature, Nov. 22</b>
      </p>
      <p>I see Alberta Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer, when questioned about Bill 22 firing the Elections Commissioner in mid-investigation of the UCP leadership campaign, responded in part: “This is democracy in action.”</p>
      <p>To quote Inigo Montoya in the movie The Princess Bride: “You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.”</p>

      <h3>Will MPs’ integrity be matched by Alberta MLAs?</h3>
      <p>Following the Liberal’s misdeeds in the SNC-Lavalin affair, two Liberal cabinet ministers, Jane Philpott and Jody Wilson-Raybould, had the courage and the personal integrity to resign their cabinet posts in protest. It will be interesting to see if any members of Alberta’s UCP caucus will have similar courage and personal integrity in the light of Jason Kenney’s outrageous firing of Alberta’s election commissioner.</p>
      <p>I view the latter action as even more egregious and dangerous to democracy than Trudeau’s and believe it is more deserving of censure.</p>

      <h3>Cuts hurt but Alberta overspent</h3>
      <p>Do the budget cuts that the UCP are making hurt? Absolutely! Did the UCP promise to balance the budget? Absolutely! The unions with jobs, promises of pensions and some raises are far better that most of Albertans who have no guarantees or pensions!</p>
      <p>I personally don’t have a pension and have not had a raise in over three years. What most people who rail against the UCP cuts fail to realize is that we are broke! The NDP spent like drunken sailors. That cannot continue, we need to live within our means.</p>

      <h3>Education minister should look in the mirror</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: CBE budget cuts were ‘reckless,’ LaGrange says, Nov. 21</b>
      </p>
      <p>I find comments regarding the CBE laying off teachers made by UCP Education Minister Adriana LaGrange hypocritical. How can she say: “What they did to the parents and the kids and the teachers is unacceptable. They’re not putting children first.” She cut $32 million in funding for public education which directly contributed to it?</p>
      <p>LaGrange has suggested school boards can use reserves to pay for funding cuts. However, a 2018-19 budget report shows that capital reserves for school boards across Alberta dwindled 7.5 per cent the previous year and it’s illegal for these boards to run a deficit. You can’t rely on reserves forever, which means funding cuts will still happen.</p>
      <p>If LaGrange wants to put kids first, maybe she should properly maintain funding for public schools, rather than cut them and get upset when school boards are forced to cut teachers.</p>

      <h3>Speed limit debate latest fiasco at city hall</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: City Council To Launch Public Consultation On Neighbourhood Speed Limits, Nov. 19</b>
      </p>
      <p>City council is planning to spend $200,000 of taxpayer money to do a public survey on speed limits on residential roads.  There are only three questions on this survey, none of which says “Leave them as they are.” Why not that question?</p>
      <p>Nowhere is it mentioned how much it will cost to replace all the street signs. Probably hundreds of thousands of dollars more.</p>
      <p>We cannot afford the survey, let alone the street signs. Maybe it is time for councillors to consider “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”</p>
