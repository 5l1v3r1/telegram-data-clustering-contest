      <p><b><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3521640-stocks-indexes-edge-higher-day-lower-week">Stocks finished</a></b> slightly higher Friday, helped by upbeat comments from Pres. Trump and China's Pres. Xi about progress on a potential U.S.-China trade deal. It remains unclear whether a phase one agreement actually will be signed this year, but with earnings season completed and the next round of major economic reports not scheduled for release until early next month, trade headlines likely will continue to have an outsized effect on stocks. Friday's slim gains were not enough to make up for earlier losses on the week, as the S&amp;P 500 snapped a six-week winning streak with a 0.3% decline, the Dow dipped 0.5% and the Nasdaq also lost 0.3%.</p>

      <p>Saudi Arabia set Aramco's (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARMCO">ARMCO</a>) preliminary valuation at $1.6T to $1.71T, below the $2T level previously targeted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The state-owned oil giant is seeking to raise between $24B and $25.6B by selling a 1.5% stake, putting it close to the world's largest IPO - Alibaba's (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA">BABA</a>) $25B deal in 2014. While the company pulled plans to market the deal in the U.S., <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSCI">MSCI</a> will follow in the path of S&amp;P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell, which told clients last week that they could fast-track Aramco's inclusion into their indexes as soon as December.<br/><b>Go deeper:</b> <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4307372-aramco-ipo-will-change-oil-dynamics">'How Aramco IPO Will Change Oil Dynamics' by CME Group.</a></p>

The shipping giant instead will launch a new 401(k) plan at the start of 2021 with a higher company match (contributing up to 8% of employee salaries, if employees provide 6% of their salary).

      <p>President Trump is "looking at" whether to exempt Apple (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL">AAPL</a>) from a coming round of tariffs on Chinese imports, adding, "We have to treat Apple on a somewhat similar basis as we treat Samsung." The comments were made during a tour touting U.S. manufacturing at a Mac Pro plant in Austin, Texas. An additional 10% tariff on China would "ultimately result in a 4% hit to (Apple's) EPS or roughly $0.50 in FY20 if the tariff ultimately went into effect," according to Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.<br/><b>Go deeper:</b> <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4307905-apple-bottom-9th-inning">Apple stock returns may not be so great going forward, writes WMA.</a></p>

Boeing still managed to garner sales for its troubled 737 MAX, scoring a total of 50 deals from Air Astana, SunExpress and an unidentified customer.

Employees who lost their jobs were "incredibly talented professionals," but the office-sharing company gave no details about which roles were cut. WeWork pulled its IPO in September after investors balked at its mounting losses and unusual corporate governance structure, eventually securing an 11th-hour bailout deal from SoftBank (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SFTBY">OTCPK:SFTBY</a>).<br/><b>Go deeper:</b> <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4307280-softbank-wework-end-game-savior-economics-sunk-cost-problem">'The SoftBank-WeWork End Game: Savior Economics Or Sunk Cost Problem?' by Aswath Damodaran.</a></p>

      <p>Almost three weeks into the job, ECB President Christine Lagarde called for regional governments to invest more in a "new European policy mix." Monetary policy should not be "the only game in town," she added, stating the central bank will undertake a "strategic review" in the near future. Uncertainties impacting eurozone growth have also "proven to be more persistent than expected," and increasing trade seen during decades of globalization is "no longer an absolute certainty."</p>
