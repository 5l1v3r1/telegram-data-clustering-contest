      <h1>Prince Andrew's disgrace will revive republic debate. Bring it on</h1>

      <p>I wonder if Prince Andrew has regained the ability to sweat? I have thought about that too many times after watching the bonfire interview he did with the BBC’s meticulous, softly spoken Emily Maitlis, a journalistic witch who managed to slay her subject while maintaining the composure of a kindly yet watchful owl.</p>

      <p>Actually, Andrew slayed himself, with his arrogance and his cluelessness, his lack of empathy, his barely concealed scoffery at the idea of dining with commoners at a high street pizza restaurant, and his bizarre explanation for why he could not possibly have danced sweatily in a London nightclub with his accuser, Virginia Giuffre, as she claims.</p>
      <p>Giuffre says that when she was 17, and under the control of Andrew’s friend, the late paedophile and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, she was forced to sleep with Prince Andrew three times. On the first of those occasions, she says she dined and danced with the heavily sweating prince before having sex with him in a house in Belgravia.</p>

      <p>Andrew told Maitlis this was impossible because he had a rare condition, at that time, which meant he was incapable of sweating. He implied he had since recovered from this peculiar affliction.</p>

      <p>I wonder if this week, he has woken up every night in a cold sweat, on the one hand happy his perspiration faculties had returned to normal, but on the other, fearing he had tipped the monarchy into a disgrace from which it would never recover, something even more embarrassing than attending a Pizza Express in Woking.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53ckk.html">the prince announced</a> he would step back from all royal duties for the time being.</p>
      <p>Many commentators have asserted Andrew is not very bright, a cruel judgment and, if true, one of the few things that really isn’t his fault.</p>
      <p>But it would account for his call to do the interview in the first place, and particularly, for his call to time it to coincide with the worldwide release of series three of <i>The Crown</i>, in which the Queen battles public resentment of her family’s privilege and wealth at a time of social change and economic insecurity.</p>
      <p>Netflix must be thrilled with him for the cross-publicity. A shame the cursed lives of the Epstein’s broken victims have become collateral damage to this latest royal scandal, but as Andrew demonstrated during his interview, these women are so irrelevant as to be beneath any mention or notice at all.</p>
      <p>The language he used to skirt around the centre of the thing – that girls were trafficked into sexual slavery – was the language of the moral hypocrite. Certain things were “unbecoming”, “inappropriate”, “unwise”.</p>
      <p>There was talk of "attendant scrutiny" and the inappropriateness of “being seen” with Epstein. It was the public eye that was the problem, not the relationship with the rotten man.</p>
      <p>There has been some Republican hand-wringing over whether it is OK to enjoy <i>The Crown</i>, and Prince Andrew has only made it worse.</p>
      <p>It used to be a good spectator-sport, royal-watching, because dysfunctional families under pressure make for good drama. It has ever been thus.</p>
      <p>All the better if the stories are given high production values, excellent costumes and beautiful interiors as they are on <i>The Crown</i>. But now it feels a little too real, a little too hard to ignore the things, the people, being trampled.</p>

      <p>In episode four of the new series, Prince Philip decides the royal family must participate in a television special, in which they are filmed doing ordinary family things such as watching telly and having picnics.</p>
      <p>It is a public relations strategy aimed at making the Windsors seem relatable, with the aim of getting the taxpayer on board with increasing their public funding.</p>
      <p>It fails. Reviews of the documentary special note that the attempt to show people what the family is "really" like do, actually, show them what the family is <i>really</i> like, and no one wants that.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on this dreadful experience to prime minister Harold Wilson, the Queen says the mystery of her family is what enables them to be “hidden while in plain sight”.</p>
      <p>“The smoke and the mirrors, the mystery and protocol, it is not there to keep us apart,” she says. “It is there to keep us alive.”</p>
      <p>In other words, their silence protects them.</p>
      <p>Andrew has got it half right, on the inappropriateness of “being seen”. The <i>Newsnight</i> interview made him seen – and the sight was ugly.</p>
      <p>It showed him for who he really is, and it revealed a glimpse of the snobbish, privileged and blindly cruel world he is a part of.</p>

      <p>How much longer will Australia want to be tied to these people?</p>
      <p>Once the Queen dies, and Prince Charles ascends to the throne of a Britain either ravaged by Brexit or still in the throes of it, how will even the staunchest of monarchists be able to argue the worth of the institution?</p>
      <p>The Prince Andrew scandal will hasten the next iteration of the Republic debate. This time, the debate must have constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples at its heart. It is no longer possible to tell the creation story of our nation while leaving out the first 60,000 years.</p>
      <p>To borrow a phrase, it is inappropriate.</p>
