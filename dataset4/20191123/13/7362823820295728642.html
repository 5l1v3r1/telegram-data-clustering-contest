      <p>Maui police on Saturday released surveillance images of the armed thief who robbed Greenleaf Diamonds of three <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/queen-elizabeth-diamonds-cleaned-gin">diamonds</a> at lunchtime on Oct. 31. They announced a $50,000 reward for information that helps nab the crook.</p>
      <p>“The business was vacant of customers when the unknown male entered (and) brandished a black Glock-like, semi-automatic looking pistol,” police said in a Facebook post.</p>
