      <p>Kylie Jenner may have raked in an enormous $600million ($463million) for selling 51% of her Kylie Cosmetics business, but it’s bad news If you own shares in the business as they plummeted following the news.</p>
      <p>While beauty giant Coty, who now own the majority of Kylie’s beauty company, did see their stocks increase slightly after the news was announced, they finished the week at the lowest they have been all month.</p>
      <p>Following the news, their stock moved up to $12.22 (£9.52), but soon dropped to $11.53 (£8.98), the lowest they’ve been in a month.</p>
      <p>TMZ reports that they ended the week down 5.5% on where they were before Kylie cashed out half of her ownership.</p>
      <p>Analysts had predicted the value of the shares to surge <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/kylie-jenner-sells-cosmetics-company-share-600m-becoming-youngest-self-made-billionaire-11176988/">after Coty snapped Kylie’s best-selling range of products up</a>, so it’ll be a bit of a blow for anyone with serious cash riding on the company.</p>

      <p>She told Entertainment Tonight: ‘I’m so proud of her. To think in her early 20s, she built a business off of something that she first was insecure about and finding confidence and, you know, just tapping into that and figuring out how to make an amazing product and just being true to herself and doing what she loves to do.</p>
      <p>‘That’s so inspiring and so amazing and I’m so proud of her. I’ve known that selling her business was always in the works for her for a long time.</p>
      <p>‘A lot of companies were bidding and really wanted to buy her brand, and so selling just about half of it was a decision that she made about a year ago and, you know, that she wanted to.’</p>
