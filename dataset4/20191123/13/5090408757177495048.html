      <p>Hello readers!</p>
      <p>Let’s talk about jobs.</p>
      <p>We’ve written plenty this year about Wall Street <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-headcount-revenue-fell-first-half-2019-coalition-data-2019-9">headcount;</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/deutsche-bank-nyc-office-as-layoffs-began-2019-7">layoffs</a> at places like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-emerges-as-victor-amid-deutsche-bank-prime-brokerage-exit-2019-9">Deutsche Bank</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/charles-schwab-managing-director-brad-sorensen-out-with-layoffs-underway-2019-9">Charles Schwab;</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/credit-suisse-hiring-freeze-for-traders-research-analysts-2019-8">hiring freezes</a>; and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ubs-head-of-americas-wealth-management-on-adviser-headcount-robos-2019-8">shrinking financial adviser ranks</a> at <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wells-fargo-financial-adviser-headcount-falls-again-in-q3-2019-10">wirehouses</a>. With 2019 drawing to a close, we’re already hearing a lot of chatter from insiders about how things will shake out next year.</p>
      <p>It’s not all doom and gloom (some <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/as-wework-cuts-staff-competitors-look-to-hire-hundreds-2019-11">positive news</a> below, I promise.) Here’s what you need to know.</p>
      <p>Recruiters and career coaches at a CFA Society of New York gathering this week said they expect more challenges after a “wonky” 2019. There’s been a yearslong trend of consolidation in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/asset-management">asset management</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/investment-banking">investment banking</a>, while <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/equity-research">sell-side</a> equity businesses have been decimated this year, they noted. There were bright spots, including <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/family-offices-angling-for-more-visibility-power-direct-investments-2019-10">family offices</a> and middle-market investment banks. Still, they advised job-seekers to keep an open mind (and a sense of humor) heading into 2020. <b><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/recruiters-tell-job-seekers-that-2020-will-be-challenging-year-2019-11">Read the full story here.</a></b></p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there’s been activity in parts of the job market that heat up as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-job-posting-for-a-recession-readiness-team-shows-how-the-bank-is-preparing-for-a-possible-downturn-2019-11">recession worries rise</a>. Recruiters told us they’re seeing an uptick from the $800 billion private-credit industry, with large direct lenders now looking to staff up their restructuring teams. But it’s a delicate balance for a business that’s ballooned over the last decade as banks retreated from riskier corporate lending – people who saw the last recession through don’t come cheap, and firms aren’t willing to warehouse them indefinitely. <b><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/shadow-lenders-playing-wait-and-see-game-on-restructuring-experts-2019-10">Read more here.</a></b></p>
      <p>In wealth management, we’ve written a lot about how firms are trying to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bank-of-america-merrill-lynch-financial-adviser-trainee-trends-shift-2019-10">bridge a generational gap</a> before a wave of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bank-of-america-merrill-lynch-wealth-management-changes-2019-11">adviser retirements</a> in the coming years.</p>
      <p>This week, we learned how Morgan Stanley is using a reverse-mentoring approach to train 15,000-plus financial advisers on its year-old <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/morgan-stanley-rolling-out-financial-adviser-feature-navigate-news-data-2019-10">WealthDesk platform.</a> That’s not just an exercise for newer, tech-savvy staffers in helping out full-fledged advisers – it’s a chance to show off and “prove to the advisers that they would be useful to a team in the branch,” Andy Saperstein, the head of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/morgan-stanley">Morgan Stanley</a> Wealth Management, told a conference in New York this week. <b><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/morgan-stanleys-wealth-head-andy-saperstein-on-wealth-tech-training-2019-11">Get all the details here.</a></b></p>
      <p>When it comes to tech talent and the battle for the best engineers, Wall Street execs declared something of a truce this week. “The war for talent is over – all the talent is working on open source,” Donald Raab, a managing director at BNY Mellon, said at a Fintech Open Source Foundation event. <b><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/banks-use-of-open-source-code-is-ending-the-war-for-talent-2019-11">See the full story here.</a></b></p>
      <p>We also had a fresh batch of news on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/insurtech-hippo-acquires-a-preventative-home-maintenance-company-2019-11">proptech</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/insurtech-hippo-acquires-a-preventative-home-maintenance-company-2019-11">insurtech</a> deals and fundraisings. More great reads below, including a roundup of VC outlooks on the payments space, a new <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/latest-goldman-sachs-news-2019-5">Goldman Sachs</a> memo, and a look at a wealth startup that’s taking the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/charles-schwab-imitating-netflix-subscription-model-2019-7">Netflix-like subscription approach</a>.</p>
      <p>Have a great weekend,</p>

      <h3>Lone Pine Capital’s latest client letter argues value investing is going extinct – and says downtrodden stocks are cheap for a reason</h3>
      <p>
        <i>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hedge-funds-whacked-in-momentum-shift-morgan-stanley-warns-more-ahead-2019-9">market-rattling momentum-stock crash</a> in September did not spare billionaire Stephen Mandel Jr.’s Lone Pine Capital.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The $19 billion hedge fund firm saw its two funds – Lone Cypress and Lone Cascade – drop 2.1% and 2.6%, respectively, for the quarter, paring year-to-date returns down to 16.9% and 19.2%, a letter to investors said. The firm cited the sudden decline in momentum stocks as reason why, but told investors that it does not plan on changing its strategy.</i>

      <h3>Execs at Warburg Pincus-backed startup Facet Wealth told us why they went with Netflix-style subscription pricing for financial planning</h3>
      <p>
        <i>If an investor assembled a basket of themes shaping the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/wealth-management">wealth management</a> industry today and fed them into a blender, they would end up with a creation that looks a lot like Facet Wealth.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Facet, a Baltimore-based registered investment adviser with a fintech twist, uses Facet-branded digital tools to pair clients with certified financial planners who work remotely from homes around the US.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The firm, founded by a financial planning executive and two venture capitalists, finds clients primarily by referrals from independent broker-dealers, hybrid robo-advisers, and traditional RIAs who might pass on them because their asset base is too small.</i>
      </p>

      <h3>We watched 15 Blackstone employees pitch charities to senior dealmakers to learn what it takes to impress the firm’s top brass</h3>
      <p>
        <i>At The Blackstone Group’s New York headquarters this week, the firm’s top brass convened in a large room on the 43rd floor to assess junior talent.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>With a small stage at the center, senior dealmakers would get to see how well a group of associates, product managers, and other staff brought in from offices around the world could make a pitch.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The pitches were for the firm to make charitable donations, not investments, but the process gave us insight into what it takes to impress Blackstone’s senior leaders.</i>

      <h3>Goldman Sachs just unveiled a new gender pronouns initiative as part of a broader inclusion push at the Wall Street firm</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Goldman Sachs is embracing gender identity with a new initiative that gives employees a choice to identify themselves by their pronoun.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The Wall Street bank has enacted a multi-faceted initiative, to be rolled out in one stage beginning immediately and adding elements over time, according to a memo sent to all employees today and viewed by Business Insider. The memo was signed by global diversity committee co-chairs Gwen Libstag and Liz Martin.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Few things are more personal than how people address us, and using a person’s self-identified pronouns,” according to the memo, “is an important way to show respect.”</i>
