      <h1>Key Bristol City defender ruled out of Nottingham Forest clash due to injury</h1>
      <h2>Exclusive: Taylor Moore is also unable to face Sabri Lamouchi's side</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:48:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:48</time> by <a rel="author">Gregor MacGregor, James Piercy</a></address>
      <p>Tomas Kalas and Taylor Moore have been ruled out of <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City's</a> Championship clash with Nottingham Forest through injury, forcing Lee Johnson into rejigging his defence once again.</p>
      <p>Kalas only returned for the Robins on November 1 following a two-month absence with a hamstring tear but after joining up with the Czech Republic squad last week has sustained a fresh injury to his knee.</p>
      <p>Kalas was an unused substitute for both of the Czech Republic's Euro 2020 qualifiers against Kosovo and Bulgaria and it's unclear whether the injury happened while away or on his return to Bristol.</p>
      <p>The news is a sizeable blow as the Robins' record signing had begun playing his way back to fitness and showed signs in the 1-0 victory over Cardiff City of returning to his best and forming a strong <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-lee-johnson-podcast-3567099">understanding with Ashley Williams</a> .</p>
      <p>Kalas had admitted frustration <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/tomas-kalas-opens-up-injury-3519067">over the length of his rehab</a> after initially believing the injury which saw him stretchered off against Hull City on August 24 would only keep him out for a few weeks.</p>
      <p>However, City were careful to manage his return due to the prospect of more long-term damage.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Johnson he's also been robbed of Kalas' immediate replacement as fellow centre-back Moore is also unlikely to make today's matchday squad <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/he-could-pivotal-big-match-3570714">having also suffered an injury</a> in training.</p>
      <p>With both Kalas and Moore out that leaves Johnson with three fit central defenders in Ashley Williams, Nathan Baker and club captain Bailey Wright, who hasn't started for the Robins since August 13 after suffering Achilles problems at the start of the season.</p>
      <p>That may force the City head coach into a tactical rethink in abandoning his preferred 3-5-2 for a more straightforward back four with Williams and Baker in the middle.</p>
      <p>There was concern over whether Dan Bentley would be able to play for City due to the imminent arrival of his daughter but the goalkeeper was seen arriving at Ashton Gate as is expected to start.</p>
