      <p>Kemba Walker has been discharged from the hospital and will be assessed again on Saturday after suffering "concussion-like symptoms" in the Celtics' defeat to theNuggets.</p>
      <p>The three-time All-Star point guard was <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/kemba-walker-injury-update-celtics/1omhgoujdstao1rvm7708nmsng">wheeled off on a stretcher</a>at the Pepsi Center following a collision with his team-mateSemi Ojeleye on Friday.</p>
      <p>Walker was treated for more than eight minutes on court after plowing into Ojeleye's midriff head first. The 29-year-old underwent tests at Denver Hospital, but was allowed to rejoin his team-mates before they returned to Boston.</p>
      <p>Walker will face further checks ahead of Boston's game against the Kings at TD Garden on Monday.</p>

      <p>"It's tough on both teams to see that,"Celtics head coach Brad Stevens said after the 96-92 loss. "And it was good to get at least early reports of good news from our standpoint.</p>
      <p>"But the head injury thing is super scary, andso you're always thinking about it, and you still have to play the last 27 minutes, which is not a fun part of it, but I thought our guys and Denver competed really hard the rest of the game."</p>
