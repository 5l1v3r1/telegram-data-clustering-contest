      <h1>Brooks: A hot time had by all at Caliente</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:00:08+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Bill Brooks, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>Willow Park Wines &amp; Spirits 26th Charity Wine Auction on Nov. 2 was a feast for the senses. Entitled Caliente, the fab fundraiser featured premium wines, handcrafted cocktails from renowned mixologists, delectable delights from some of our city’s best chefs, excellent entertainment, and, of course, the renowned silent and live auction. A trip for two to Spain including eight nights’ accommodation, winery tours, meals and all the trappings was the top live auction item, garnering a cool $27,000. Other coveted auction items included two, 750-mL. bottles of 40-year old Petrus fetching $10,500. That the event raised more than $250,000 for the Vintage Fund is proof there can be nothing better than having a hot time while raising funds for charity.</p>
      <p>The Vintage Fund has, over the years, donated more than $5 million to charitable foundations. Proceeds from this year’s event will be directed to the Alberta Children’s Hospital Foundation’s Build Them Up Centre for Child and Youth Mental Health, the Tom Baker Cancer Centre, Wellspring Calgary and the Alberta Animal Rescue Society.</p>
      <p>Caliente co-chairs Reid and Karen Henuset as well as the staff and volunteers at Willow Park are to be commended on a job well done.  Guests having a marvellous time included: Willow Park Wine &amp; Spirits founder and El Tequileno Distillery owner Wayne Henuset and his wife Liz; Scott Henuset and his wife Suzanne; Michael Henuset and his wife Mylin; Willow Park president Peggy Perry and her husband, Alpine Canada’s Brien Perry; Secure Energy president Rene Amirault with family members Marguerite, Chad and Dylan Amirault; event decor specialist responsible for the visual delights Jerry Chong; El Tequileno’s Jas Madsen and Steve Kamajian; Pacific Wines’ Linda Robinson; artist Elle Wray; Larry and Jan Fichtner; the always appropriately attired Brendan Hunter; Andrew Peller Import Agency territory manager Tim Auger; Wagner Family of Wine Western Canada regional manager Jamie Strong and colleague Sarah Lucente; Rick Bowie and his wife Jane; Rosie Pe; Marin Shibley; Michaela Ralph; Quinn Button; Anna McNamara; Jenn Edgar; Calgary Herald deputy editor Monica Zurowski and her partner, Terry Spath with Calgary Lawn and Turf; and Postmedia sales wizards Dean Jager, Jeff Wright and Laura Linnell.</p>
      <p>Also, I note an error in last week’s column. In the Alberta Business Hall of Fame item, Kathy Rwamuningi was identified as Suzanne West’s daughter. She is the late business icon’s sister.</p>
