      <p>With Christmas just around the corner, the big supermarket chains are pumping out plenty of festive-themed products.</p>
      <p>Primark has good news for Disney-loving customers on the hunt for <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/">Christmas presents</a>: it's selling not only furry Mickey Mouse rugs, but also matching Mickey bedding.</p>
      <p>The clothing and home goods chain is known for its bargains, and it looks as though it has products that will make fans of the iconic animated character want to rush out and buy.</p>
      <p>The company featured the products on its Instagram feed, and captioned the image: "Just what your clubhouse has been calling out for."</p>

      <p>The furry rug, which comes in the shape of Mickey's instantly-recognisable head and ears, costs £12.</p>
      <p>One excited shopper commented on social media: "Can't wait to get this for my daughter's bedroom!"</p>

      <p>With prices starting at just £1, the range includes everything from Olaf-shaped potato shapes to Frozen-themed lollies.</p>
