      <h1>Patriots Announce Injury Update For QB Tom Brady</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:34:43+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The New England Patriots released their injury report for Sunday’s game against the Cowboys late on Friday night. One name on the report stood out: Tom Brady.</p>
      <p>Brady is listed as “questionable” for Sunday’s game against the Cowboys with elbow soreness.</p>
      <p>Is there actually any chance of Brady not playing on Sunday afternoon against Dallas, though?</p>
      <p>No, there does not appear to be any chance of that.</p>
      <p>“Tom Brady, who was listed as questionable on the injury report, is expected to play, source said. More managing the elbow and taking care of it than anything,” NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport tweeted.</p>

      <p>It’s reportedly a legitimate injury, though. The Patriots are reportedly monitoring the soreness and will re-evaluate today.</p>
      <p>Brady has not missed a start due to injury since 2008.</p>
