      <p>The match is scheduled to start at 15h00</p>
      <p>Masandawana have not won a match in open play in their last four competitive outings and Pitso Mosimane will be hoping his charges regain their form after a welcomed international break, with influential midfielder Gaston Sirino coming back from injury.</p>

      <p>The reigning back-to-back Absa Premiership champions will be hoping to get a revenge over Arrows after suffering a 3-2 defeat to Steve Komphela’s troops at the same stadium just before the FIFA break.</p>
      <p>Sundowns have won the League Cup three times but they have captured the Telkom Knockout only once in it’s current guise in 2015, after thrashing Komphela's Kaizer Chiefs 3-1 in the final.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Abafana Bes’thende will be hoping to reach their first League Cup final this time around, after reaching the quarter-final stage last season.</p>
      <p>With Maritzburg United facing Kaizer Chiefs on Sunday, Arrows will be hoping for an all KwaZulu-Natal final at the Moses Mabhida Stadium.</p>
