      <p>The state has asked the United States Supreme Court not to review Michelle Carter's involuntary manslaughter conviction.</p>
      <p>Carter's defense team is challenging whether Massachusetts' manslaughter law is constitutional.</p>
      <p>Carter is currently serving a 15-month prison sentence after being convicted in the 2014 death of her boyfriend, Conrad Roy.</p>
      <p>Roy died of carbon monoxide poisoning after locking himself in his truck.</p>
      <p>Carter texted him numerous messages encouraging him to take his own life.</p>
