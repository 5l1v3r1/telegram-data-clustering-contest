      <p>Steve Bruce has revealed Matty Longstaff was 'devastated' to be dropped from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United's</a> first-team - and has laid out what the teenager must do to maintain his momentum.</p>
      <p>Longstaff enjoyed a Premier League debut to remember playing alongside brother Sean and scoring the winner against Manchester United at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/st-james-park">St James' Park</a> .</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old kept his place for the following two matches against Chelsea and Wolves, but the brothers were replaced in the starting XI by Isaac Hayden and Jonjo Shelvey for the victories against West Ham and Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>Longstaff's form with the Magpies was rewarded with two appearances for England's under-20s in the recent international break. Bruce recently stated the club remained "quietly confident" of extending the midfielder's deal - which is due to expire at the end of the season.</p>

      <p>Speaking to BBC Newcastle, United's head coach spoke about the teenager's reaction to being left out of the starting XI, and what he must now do following his rise to the first-teams squad..</p>
      <p>Bruce said: "I'm delighted. Everything that comes his way, I'm delighted.</p>
      <p>"What a month he's had. He was absolutely devastated to be left out, but he's had a wonderful five or six weeks and to cap it off, playing for England.</p>
      <p>"He's just got to keep improving, which he will do. Keep his feet on the ground, which he will do.</p>
      <p>"And we're all delighted at the club that he's been given international recognition."</p>
