      <p>The First Lady Amai Auxillia Mnangagwa is a stickler for customs and cultural values. When President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the first lady visited Vice President Constantino Chiwenga who returned home today the First Lady showed VP Chiwenga respect by kneeling on the floor and asking about his health and life. This is a traditional custom usually performed by women, especially when they are at their in-laws’.</p>
