      <p><b>BROOKVILLE, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - General Motors is building a $175 million plant in Ohio to produce truck engine components that will employ about 100 people.</p>
      <p>Plant construction is underway and is expected to be completed by the end of next year in the Dayton suburb of Brookville.</p>
      <p>The GM-DMAX plant will make components for Duramax diesel truck engines, supplying a nearby DMAX engine plant in Moraine.</p>
      <p>The Ohio-built diesel engines will go into the new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra heavy duty trucks, the Dayton Daily News reported.</p>
      <p>GM's executive vice president of global manufacturing, Gerald Johnson, said Thursday that the Moraine DMAX plant has been operating at high capacity to meet growing demand for the Duramax engine.</p>
      <p>DMAX is a joint venture of GM and Isuzu.</p>
