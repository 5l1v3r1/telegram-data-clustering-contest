      <p>Fans were happily surprised when Axl Rose and Slash buried the hatchet after decades of acrimony and hit the road with Guns N’ Roses “Not In This Lifetime…” tour — and may be even more surprised by just how much the rock reunion earned.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8544389/guns-n-roses-in-this-lifetime-tour"><i>Billboard</i></a>, the band’s world tour — which began in 2016 and concluded earlier this month with a two-night stint in las Vegas — traversed six continents and sold 5,371,891 tickets.</p>
      <p>All told, the band raked in a staggering $584.2 million, becoming the third highest-grossing tour in the history of <i>Billboard</i>‘s Boxscore — not bad for a band that hadn’t performed together, let along spoke, since 1993.</p>
