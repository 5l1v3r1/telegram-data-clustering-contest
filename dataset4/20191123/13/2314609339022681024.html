      <h1>Asset rich but cash poor? Here are a few options to consider</h1>

        <b>I am a 73-year-old single woman, on a full Centrelink pension, with one adult independent daughter. I have no superannuation, just some savings for emergency spending. What would the best solution be to create some cash flow for me? I have a two-bedroom apartment in an excellent position near train transport. Would it be a good move to downgrade to a one-bedroom apartment, or should I take out a reverse mortgage, if possible? I have no intention of buying into a retirement home just yet. U.Z.</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you are in a prime position with a fully paid off home, I would hesitate to move. It costs about 2.5 per cent of the value of the property to sell and another five per cent to buy elsewhere which, considering the inflated value of property, would cost a lot of dollars.</p>

      <p>You might consider one of four options:</p>
      <p><b>(a)</b> You could use Centrelink’s Pension Loans Scheme, which is a reverse mortgage. It has the advantage of charging a lower interest rate of 5.25 per cent.</p>
      <p>However, even low-interest loans compound rapidly over time.</p>
      <p>The Department of Human Services shows on its website how a fortnightly loan of $50 ($1300 a year) compounds to $13,000 over 10 years and $19,500 over 15 years.</p>
      <p>In effect, your initial loan increases by a factor of 10 over 10 years and 15 over 15 years. At 73, you have a statistical life expectancy of about 16 years and, if healthy, you can expect to be in the 50 per cent that live longer than that.</p>
      <p><b>(b)</b> You could rent your second bedroom either continually or through AirBnB, but be aware that capital-gains tax (CGT) would then apply, in proportion to the time the room earned income and the floor space rented.</p>
      <p><b>(c)</b> If your adult daughter has no home, you can use Centrelink’s granny flat provisions to sell your home and contribute to the purchase of a house in your daughter’s name, but with a self-contained granny flat and signed legal agreement spelling out your rights.</p>
      <p>Be aware there could be some CGT consequences for your daughter.</p>
      <p><b>(d)</b> You could consider one of the low-cost “lifestyle villages”, or “manufactured home estates” with no stamp duty, such as those offered by Gateway, Ingenia, National Lifestyle Villages (in WA) or Queensland’s Living Gems. Be sure to research them thoroughly first.</p>
      <p>
        <b>I'm in my late 40s, an Australian citizen and brought my small National Health Service pension from the UK to superannuation fund HESTA, which was a Qualified Registered Overseas Pension Scheme (QROPS) at the time. They signed the papers in September 2014 and the funds arrived in the HESTA account on April 28, 2015. I've gone to see if I can transfer to another low-fee super fund and found HESTA is not a QROPS and am concerned as to what I can do. T.E.</b>
      </p>
      <p>From March 2015, the UK government changed its rules for its QROPS, introducing a “55 per cent member unauthorised payment charge” (MUPC) on UK benefits paid before age 55.</p>
      <p>Since Australian super funds could pay benefits in certain cases before 55 – for example, on compassion grounds or hardship cases – most Australian funds dropped their QROPS registration.</p>
      <p>UK adviser <a href="http://www.montfort-intl.com/">Montfort International </a>points out that, in your case, the MUPC applies unless HESTA secured a negotiated exemption for you with the UK government.</p>
      <p>They add: “It is possible that Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) may not follow up on a number of member-unauthorised payment charges resulted in that period, because some of these transfers were requested before April 5, 2015, and completed just afterwards.</p>
      <p>"You would firstly need to contact HESTA to check if in 2015-2016 they reached an agreement with HMRC not to charge you a 55 per cent MUPC. If not, you would need to take UK tax advice and report the unauthorised payment (if you withdraw).</p>
      <p>"There could be other exemptions that may apply, for example, if you were a non-UK resident in any of the five previous UK tax years preceding that payment, meaning that, in your case, if you were non-UK resident from April 6, 2010. Only after sorting this issue can you roll over the fund to another super fund."</p>
      <p>I point out that that all your super benefits are preserved until retirement after age 60, anyway, or on reaching 65 if still working.</p>
      <p>HESTA adds that if you withdraw the money it must report this to HMRC, which will assess the tax – unless the money is transferred to a QROPS. So, it doesn’t sound like any such agreement described above exists. HESTA has no say in the matter.</p>
      <p>HESTA as an above-average performing industry fund and I would be quite happy to leave money there until retirement. Just keep an eye on the performance of its investment options.</p>
      <p>
        <b>My wife and I have formed a proprietary limited company, as sole directors, with a paid-up capital of $20 – 10 shares each. We loaned the company interest free $1.4 million, as we do not need the interest. By leaving profits in the company, we can build further equity. If we later require some funds, we will declare a fully franked dividend. The company has in turn purchased two home units as rental properties, covered by landlord’s insurance, for about $1 million, with the rest in cash earning about 2 per cent interest. We want to eliminate a worst-case scenario i.e. in case the company gets sued and to safeguard our shareholder loans. Should we: 1. Create a first mortgage over the company’s assets? 2. Would this attract stamp duty? 3. A loan agreement? 4. Would this attract stamp duty? 5. Do nothing? 6. Any other suggestion. J S</b>
      </p>
      <p>Your interest-free loan is basically a non-arms length loan, so I hope you have run this past a tax accountant, which I am not.</p>
      <p>I would prefer that you covered yourself with a first mortgage, along with a minimal-interest rate, say $100 a year, so there could be no argument that the money ever represents a gift or an investment. And, yes, in NSW, you would pay stamp duty on the mortgage, being $18,267 on each $500,000 property.</p>
      <p>I presume you have invested with the hope of a capital gain in the future and you realise that, by using a company rather investing in your own names, you have foregone the 50 per cent discount on capital gains when sold after 12 months.</p>
