      <p>Ex-talk show host and<a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/"> I'm A Celebrity</a> star Ian Wright previously turned down the chance to present The X Factor, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Retired footballer Ian claimed Simon Cowell offered him the job in the early 2000s, when he was riding high as a presenter on the small screen.</p>
      <p>But the telly pundit, 57, was said to have decided against it after trying out for the role on a show called This Is Your Moment.</p>
      <p>Kate Thornton went on to host <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/x-factor/">The X Factor</a> from 2004 to 2006, before Dermot O'Leary took over the role.</p>

      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/im-celebs-ian-wright-says-20940254">Daily Star</a>, Ian said: "I remember there was time before X Factor and that started, they wanted me to do that X Factor show because they tested it out with a show called This Is Your Moment way back.</p>
      <p>"It was that show where I thought to myself I just couldn't do it any more."</p>

      <p>He added: "It turned out to be very good but, the thing about it is, I wouldn't have been happy doing it."</p>
      <p>Following the success of his football career, which saw him play for England and premiership team Arsenal, Ian became a guest host on Top Of The Pops.</p>
