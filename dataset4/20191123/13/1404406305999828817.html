      <p>Recently, Damon Dash held a secret show where he unveils his latest project: a funk rock band called Billy Pablo and the Black Guns. Dame is serving as the lead singer of the group and reportedly performed some of the crewâ€™s new material. This is an interesting take for the 48-year-old mogul, but not a new one, as he brought together the like of the Black Keys and various rappers for his BlakRoc project in 2009. Watch above.</p>
