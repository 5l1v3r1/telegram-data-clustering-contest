      <h1>Kyrie Irving injury update: Nets guard won't be available for game in Boston</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:57:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:57</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Gatto</a></address>
      <p>Kyrie Irving's shoulder injury will keep him out of action past his first scheduled return to Boston since leaving the Celtics for the Nets in the offseason.</p>
      <p>The Nets <a href="https://www.nba.com/nets/news/preview/2019/11/24/nets-vs-knicks-resilient-brooklyn-eyeing-shot-to-even-record">announced Friday night that</a> Irving will not be available for the team's trip to Manhattan (vs.the Knicks) on Sunday, Cleveland on Monday and then TD Garden on Wednesday. Irving played two seasons for the Celtics after being acquired in a 2017 trade with the Cavaliers.</p>

      </p>
      <p>He left Boston on less than amicable terms after being involved in conflicts with teammates and management. Celtics team president Danny Ainge told a Boston radio station earlier in the week (<a href="https://theathletic.com/1402977/2019/11/22/kyrie-irving-to-miss-boston-return-because-of-lingering-shoulder-injury/">per The Athletic</a>, subscription required) that Celts fans should not boo Irving. That won't be an issue now that Irving won't be playing.</p>
      <p>"I think that's a sad commentary," Ainge told the Toucher &amp; Rich program. "But I understand it just because I know there's been a lot of negative attention. . . . I just think it's a bad conclusion to come to. It's not really fair."</p>
      <p>Irving missed his fourth consecutive game Friday with a right shoulder impingement. The earliest he could return is Friday, Nov. 29, at home vs. the Celtics.</p>
      <p>Brooklyn has gone 3-1 in Irving's absence. The Nets defeated the Kings 116-97 on Friday. Spencer Dinwiddie has started in Irving's place.</p>
