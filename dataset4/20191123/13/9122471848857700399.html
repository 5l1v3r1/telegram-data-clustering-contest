      <h1>2 NFL Teams Are Reportedly Interested In QB Colin Kaepernick</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:17:24+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Colin Kaepernick remains unsigned following his workout for NFL teams in Atlanta last weekend, though there reportedly is some interest developing for the talented quarterback.</p>
      <p>Mark Geragos, the attorney for the quarterback, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/2-nfl-teams-interested-in-colin-kaepernick-attorney-claims/">said on <i>The Adam Carolla Podcast </i>this week</a> that there are two NFL teams interested in Kaepernick.</p>
      <p>One of the teams is reportedly in desperate need of some help at the quarterback position, while the other team has an owner who could be willing to pull the trigger on a move.</p>
      <p>“One who is legitimately in need of a quarterback who had a very poor showing on Sunday and has got an owner that I don’t think gives a sh-t,” he said.</p>
      <p>There’s speculation that one of those teams is the Carolina Panthers, who have an injured Cam Newton and a struggling Kyle Allen at the quarterback position. They also have one of Kaepernick’s former teammates and biggest supporters in Eric Reid.</p>

      <p>Kaepernick said after his workout that he’s been ready to get back into the NFL for three years.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been ready. I’m staying ready. And I’ll continue to be ready. To all the people that came out today to support, I appreciate y’all, I love y’all. To the people that aren’t here, I’m thinking of you, I appreciate you supporting from where you are. We’ll continue to give you updates as we hear. We’ll be waiting to hear from Roger Goodell, the NFL, 32 teams. We’ll let you know if we hear from them,” he said after his workout.</p>
      <p>“The ball’s in their court. We’re ready to go.”</p>
      <p>No NFL team has publicly admitted to have interest in signing Kaepernick. We’ll see if that changes anytime soon.</p>
