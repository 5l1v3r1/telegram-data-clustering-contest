      <p>Ottawa went on to win the game 4-1, which stretches their winning streak to three.</p>
      <p>Brown, who was a first round pick of the Sens in the 2016 draft, was playing in just his 15th NHL game.</p>
      <p>"That's something I've dreamt about my whole life and then especially the past couple weeks ... with all the unlucky bounces I've had. Been thinking about getting that one. It's definitely a dream come true." Brown told the media after the game.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old North Carolina native played part of the 2017-18 season with the Kitchener Rangers after being acquired in a trade with Windsor.</p>
