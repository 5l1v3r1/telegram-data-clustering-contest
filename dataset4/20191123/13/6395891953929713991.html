      <p>The 2019-2020 Coats For Kids Drive is underway.</p>
      <p>The goal is simple — to provide a warm winter coat to anyone who needs one.</p>
      <p>Now in its 25th year, the Anton's Cleaners program has collected, cleaned and distributed more than 1 million coats to local children and adults in need.</p>
      <p>So where do all those coats come from? Donors like you!</p>
      <p>Help us reach our goal of collecting 50,000 warm winter coats.</p>
      <p>Join the Boston 25 News Weather Team and JAMN 94.5 at Jordan's Furniture in Avon on Saturday, Dec. 7 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. for Coat Drop-Off Day. We will be accepting kids and adult size coats in good condition.</p>
      <p>Additional drop-off sites include all Anton's Cleaners, Enterprise Bank, and Jordan's Furniture locations through Jan. 12, 2020. For more information about Coats For Kids, <a href="http://antons.com/cfk/">click here</a>.</p>
      <p>Thank you for helping keep our neighbors warm!</p>
