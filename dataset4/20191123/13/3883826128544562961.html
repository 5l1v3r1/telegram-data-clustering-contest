        <b>Four people - including two Britons - escaped after their yacht sank more than 50 miles off the coast of an Indonesian island.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The skipper raised the alarm after the boat, named Asia, hit an object in the water at about 21:00 GMT on Friday.</p>
      <p>The UK coastguard, which helped co-ordinate the response, said the crew sailed a lifeboat to land, where they were found more than eight hours later.</p>
      <p>Malaysian officials were alerted by the UK after Australia picked up the SOS.</p>
      <p>Australian authorities contacted their British counterparts because the yacht appeared to be registered in the UK.</p>
      <p>The UK Coastguard found no-trace of the ship on its records but did notice an alert on a US alarm system in approximately the same area.</p>
      <p>They were then able to trace the skipper's wife, who was able to tell them where the ship had been heading.</p>
      <p>This helped Malaysian authorities to finally make contact with the skipper at about 05:00 GMT.</p>
      <p>A short while later, the crew were met by local police near the town of Bima, in the West Nusa Tenggara province.</p>
      <p>Controller David Jones led the UK response from the National Maritime Operations Centre in Fareham, Hampshire.</p>
      <p>He said he was "relieved" to know the crew were safe and that the operation "demonstrated good international working".</p>
