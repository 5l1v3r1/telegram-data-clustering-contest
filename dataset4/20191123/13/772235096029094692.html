      <p><b>Darcy Foster • </b>The <b>Bloodhound LSR</b> has recorded a top speed of <b>1010km/h</b> (628mph) in final testing for 2019 ahead of a land-speed record attempt some time in the next two years.</p>
      <p>Piloted by Air Force wing commander Andy Green, the Bloodhound LSR completed a number of tests and obtained vital data to help engineers determine the rocket’s payload size for a crack at the current land-speed record.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the test's conclusion, Green said “the stability and confidence the car gives me as a driver is testament to the years of world class engineering that has been invested in her by team members past and present”.</p>
      <p>“With all the data generated by reaching 1010 km/h (628 mph), we’re in a great position to focus on setting a new world land-speed record in the next year or so.”</p>

      <p>Green is the current land-speed record holder, piloting the Thrust SSC in 1997 to a top speed of <b>1227km/h</b> (763mph) and in the process becoming the first person to break the sound barrier in a land vehicle.</p>
      <p>The Bloodhound LSR project was launched in 2008 as the ‘Bloodhound SSC’ by Richard Noble.</p>
      <p>Noble held the land-speed record for 14 years, recording a top speed of <b>1019</b> km/h (633 mph) in 1983.</p>
      <p>With Andy Green signing on as pilot, the Bloodhound LSR’s ultimate goal was to surpass 1000mph (1609km/h).</p>

      <p>Over a lengthy, ten-year developmental and testing process though, skyrocketing costs eventually forced the program into administration in October 2018.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, British businessman Ian Warhurst purchased the business and its assets in December 2018, renaming the initiative from Bloodhound SSC to ‘Bloodhound LSR’ under his new company Grafton LSR Ltd.</p>
