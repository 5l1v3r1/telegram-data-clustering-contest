      <h1>Binance CEO: ‘We Will Be Suing’ The Block Over China Police Raid Story</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:12:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:12</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>The CEO of cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/binance">Binance</a> has vowed to sue industry media outlet The Block over alleged false reporting.</p>
      <p>In an ongoing <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1198092831560126464">Twitter exchange</a> on Nov. 22, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/changpeng-zhao">Changpeng Zhao</a>, known as CZ in crypto circles, promised to take legal action over an article that claimed Binance’s Shanghai office was receiving attention from <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/china">Chinese</a> police.</p>
      <h3>CZ to The Block: “Own up and apologize”</h3>
      <p>“We will be suing them,” he wrote in one tweet.</p>
      <p>The offending piece originally surfaced on Friday and was part of multiple reports of a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-drops-below-73k-as-china-vows-to-dispose-of-exchanges">fresh crypto clampdown</a> by China. At the same time, Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) slid to below $7,000.</p>
      <p>The Block initially made its claims under the headline “Binance's Shanghai office shut down following visit by authorities, sources say.”</p>
      <p>After a wide backlash over the factual accuracy of the article, during which CZ demanded the publication “apologize” but ruled out court action, The Block released a <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/48112/setting-the-record-straight-on-our-binance-reporting">follow-up piece</a> defending its stance.</p>
      <p>This appeared to inflame tensions further, leading CZ to change his mind on the issue, which he <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1197685244435914752">originally said</a> would be “a bit too much trouble for now.”</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1198092367103807493">wrote</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Instead of apologizing to the community for the fake headline news of the non-existent ‘police raid’, which damaged our reputation, and $btc price, theBlock now tries to argue if there was an office, if CZ had a meeting... who cares? Own up &amp; apologize for your mistake.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Nonexistent raids on nonexistent offices?</h3>
      <p>Specifically, CZ took The Block to task over its claims Binance encountered a police raid, and that it even had a Shanghai office at all. The latter issue remains unclear, the publication citing “witnesses” and previous media coverage, which CZ rejected.</p>
      <p>Staff nonetheless changed the headline of the original article to remove reference to a “police raid,” instead claiming Binance received a “visit from authorities.” The URL of the article, which is still online, remains in its original form, including the “police raid” phrase.</p>
      <p>During the Twitter storm, responses suggested The Block implicated Binance in a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-shenzhen-identifies-39-crypto-exchanges-defying-trading-ban">crackdown</a> by Chinese authorities in Shenzhen, but that this was erroneous.</p>
      <p>“Raided Chinese Exchanges are based in Shenzhen who explicitly dealt with CHINESE customers &amp; involved ponzies. Binance and Bithumb were NOT raided,” content creator <a href="https://twitter.com/boxmining/status/1198009174883360769">Boxmining</a> countered.</p>
      <h3>Pressure over $1M+ ‘FUD fighting fund’</h3>
      <p>By press time on Saturday, The Block’s cofounder <a href="https://twitter.com/mdudas/status/1197963970025533441">Mike Dudas</a> had joined in the quarrel with CZ after the latter suggested creating a dedicated fund to combat the practice of spreading so-called “fear, uncertainty and doubt,” or “FUD.”</p>
      <p>On Twitter, CZ had seen interest from Justin Sun, CEO of blockchain platform Tron (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tron">TRX</a>), and matched his pledge to donate 100 BTC ($716,000) to the fund. For Dudas, this was an attempt at stifling press freedom.</p>
      <p>“Two of the wealthiest men in cryptocurrency plan to raise a ‘FUD fighting fund’ worth more than $1 million, presumably to wield as an implicit threat against journalists who report facts that run contrary to their business interests,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>Cointelegraph has reached out to Binance for comment but had not received a response by press time.</p>
