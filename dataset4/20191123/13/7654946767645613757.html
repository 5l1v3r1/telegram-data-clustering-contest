      <h1>Ohio State vs. Penn State prediction, line: Take the Buckeyes</h1>

      <p>Now that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/alabamas-tua-tagovailoa-taking-first-step-in-long-recovery/">Tua Tagovailoa’s college career is likely over</a>, what was the most amazing thing about it? How close it came to just being at its beginning.</p>
      <p>Jalen Hurts had just two losses in two years as Alabama’s starter. One came in the national championship game his freshman year. He was the SEC’s Offensive Player of the Year as a freshman. He was the Sugar Bowl’s Offensive MVP as a sophomore in the playoff. If Hurts hadn’t followed that with one of his worst halves of football, Tagovailoa would have been on the bench in the national championship game against Georgia, as the freshman had been throughout that 2017 season for the Crimson Tide. Then, Tagovailoa would have transferred and sat out last season before becoming a starter for the first time a few months ago.</p>
      <p>But Alabama coach Nick Saban gambled, Tagovailoa swooped in, snatched another national title for the Tide and became the best quarterback Tuscaloosa had ever seen.</p>
      <p>Now, imagine if Kirby Smart had pulled the trigger, too.</p>
      <p>Instead, while Jake Fromm is doing his best Brad Johnson as Georgia’s game manager, his former backup, Justin Fields, is leading the nation’s highest-scoring offense at Ohio State. While Fromm is throwing for less than 200 yards per game, Fields is averaging more than four total touchdowns per game and has been intercepted once the entire season. While the Bulldogs are banking on their defense to carry them to a title, the Buckeyes’ top-ranked defense is complemented by a dual-threat in Fields who could help complete one of the most dominant seasons in the sport’s history.</p>
      <p>Led by the first-year starting quarterback, the Buckeyes have won every game by at least 24 points. Their average margin of victory (41.7) could end up being college football’s highest since World War II.</p>
      <p>While Penn State has presented problems for <b>OHIO STATE (-18½)</b> the past three years, Buckeyes coach Ryan Day sports a better team than Urban Meyer ever had. The Nittany Lions, after being shredded by Tanner Morgan (Minnesota) and Peyton Ramsey (Indiana) in back-to-back weeks, are ill-prepared for what Fields and a returning Chase Young are about to unleash.</p>
      <p><b>IOWA HAWKEYES (-15) over Illinois Illini:</b> Perception changes quickly. Just two weeks ago, the Illini were 15-point underdogs against one of Mark Dantonio’s worst-ever teams at Michigan State. Now, Lovie Smith has four straight wins, marking the school’s longest winning streak in 18 years. But an Illinois defense reliant on turnovers won’t cash in against an opponent averaging less than one giveaway per game.</p>

      <p><b>NORTHWESTERN WILDCATS (+13½) over Minnesota Golden Gophers:</b> Minnesota quarterback Tanner Morgan is in concussion protocol and will likely be a game-time decision. His backups are a pair of true freshmen, who have thrown a combined three passes this season. Don’t pick until pregame warm-ups.</p>
      <p><b>Boston College Eagles (+19½) over NOTRE DAME FIGHTING IRISH:</b> The Fighting Irish will have no trouble putting up points against a defense susceptible to big plays, but their mediocre run defense will allow the Eagles’ fourth-ranked ground game to limit the damage with clock-eating drives.</p>
      <p><b>Texas A&amp;M Aggies (+13½) over GEORGIA BULLDOGS:</b> This is a lot of points to ask of an offense averaging fewer than 23 over the past five games, especially against a top-30 defense. As a home favorite, Georgia is just 2-4 against the spread this season.</p>
      <p><b>INDIANA HOOSIERS (+9¹/₂) over Michigan Wolverines:</b> The team blown out by Wisconsin and taken to overtime by Army suddenly seems like a potential threat to Ohio State in next week’s showdown in Ann Arbor. We won’t be the only ones looking ahead to the Wolverines’ biggest game of the year.</p>
      <p><b>Texas Longhorns (+5½) over BAYLOR BEARS:</b> The hangover continues. After blowing a 25-point lead and their playoff chances in a meltdown against Oklahoma, the Bears’ 9-0 start will feel even more distant with a second straight loss. Texas’ Tom Herman is 15-4-1 against the spread as a head coach.</p>
      <p><b>Ucla Bruins (+13½) over USC TROJANS:</b> There are 110 teams averaging fewer than two giveaways per game. The Bruins and Trojans are not among them. Grab the points with such a massive wild-card hanging over both teams’ heads.</p>
      <p><b>WISCONSIN BADGERS (-25) over Purdue Boilermakers:</b> Jeff Brohm recently pointed out that the Badgers’ third-ranked defense struggles against mobile quarterbacks. “I don’t know if that’s what we can do at this point,” said the Purdue coach, starting his third quarterback this season, “but that is what’s hurt them.” Good to know.</p>
      <p><b>Arkansas Razorbacks (+44) over LSU TIGERS:</b> If Rutgers could comfortably cover against Ohio State, the Hogs certainly have a chance against the biggest SEC spread in four decades.</p>
      <p><b>CINCINNATI BEARCATS (-10½) over Temple Owls:</b> The best Group of Five team doesn’t deserve playoff consideration this season, but it remains remarkable that the most powerful voices in college football agree that more than half of the teams in the nation are irrelevant.</p>
      <p><b>Oregon Ducks (-14½) over ARIZONA STATE SUN DEVILS:</b> The Sun Devils have lost four straight. They haven’t beaten a team with a winning record. They rank 113th in the nation in rushing, 109th in passing yards allowed, 80th in sacks and 87th in penalties per game. Perhaps I was premature in admitting to being wrong about Herm Edwards’ hiring.</p>
      <p><b>Tcu Horned Frogs (+18) over OKLAHOMA SOONERS:</b> The Sooners will win a fifth straight Big 12 title. They may even sneak into the playoff. But I never again want to be aligned with Lincoln Riley’s defense, which allowed 120 points in the past three games.</p>
      <p><b>ARIZONA WILDCATS (+22½) over Utah Utes:</b> Because the Utes have covered every game in their six-game winning streak. Because going against the grain has gone really well for me this year.</p>
      <p><b>Best bets:</b> Texas A&amp;M, Texas, Oregon<br/><b>This season (Best bets):</b> 83-99-3 (15-21)<br/><b>2014-18 record:</b> 641-612-10</p>
