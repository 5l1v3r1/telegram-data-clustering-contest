      <h1>'He's an animal': Divisive minister David Elliott faces summer of scrutiny</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Rabe</a></address>
      <p>In the space of a week, David Elliott was accused of impersonating a police officer, attacked for controversial comments over strip-searches and faced with the most devastating bushfires in the state's history.</p>
      <p>Disliked by Barry O'Farrell but adored by Mike Baird, the Police and Emergency Services Minister has been described by his colleagues as a divisive "crash or crash-through" politician.</p>

      <p>While some have praised his hard-headedness and ability to perform under pressure, others believe the way Mr Elliott operates can land him in hot water. They say the past month encapsulates his political career.</p>
      <p>"He's utterly ruthless, he's just an animal," a government minister said.</p>
      <p>Others have described Mr Elliott as "loyal," but added there was concern both within police and at Macquarie Street when Ms Berejiklian promoted him to Police Minister.</p>
      <p>Those concerns largely abated until this month, when Mr Elliott remarked in a press conference that he would happily allow his own children to be strip-searched, before news broke that he had allegedly <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53ah9.html">pulled over a teenage driver</a> and told him he "worked for the cops".</p>
      <p>While some within the party saw the strip-search comment as little more than a gaffe, the P plater story sparked a police inquiry into Mr Elliott for impersonating a police officer, of which he was cleared earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Despite being cleared, a former colleague said the incident had again raised concerns about Mr Elliott's temperament. Another Liberal insider said it was further evidence that he was a "loose cannon," while others defended him.</p>
      <p>"He's probably made a couple of mistakes in the past week and he just needs to put it behind him," one Liberal MP said, adding they considered Mr Elliott a friend.</p>
      <p>Despite the criticisms, almost all colleagues agreed Mr Elliott had stepped up to the plate during the recent deadly bushfires, amid personal controversy.</p>
      <p>"I think it was handled very well," an MP said, adding the timing of the fires may well have helped shift the spotlight away from Mr Elliott's own issues.</p>

      <p>"He maybe dodged a bullet to some degree," they said.</p>
      <p>Former prime minister John Howard, for whom Mr Elliott worked for four years in the 1990s, believes he is a "competent and effective minister".</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Mr Howard said the former PM also stood by a letter of endorsement he wrote for Mr Elliott's preselection in 2010, where he described him as "engaging and outgoing with a personality suiting him for public life".</p>
      <p>While he has experienced a tumultuous November, the act that garnered Mr Elliott the most infamy came in 2018, when he used parliamentary privilege to accuse then-Labor leader Luke Foley of drunkenly harassing an ABC journalist.</p>
      <p>Mr Elliott's comment blew up what had already been a rumour circulating in the press gallery, and lit the fuse on a scandal that would result in Mr Foley resigning as leader just months before the state election.</p>
      <p>One Liberal insider said Mr Elliott was meant to be on his feet delivering a legislative attack on the Labor opposition when he lost his cool amid interjections from Mr Foley and veered off course.</p>
      <p>"In what could have and should have been a great hit on Labor … without reference to the strategy group, the leadership group or anyone else, he embroils the government in a pretty tawdry affair," they said.</p>
      <p>Other colleagues said they respected the fact Mr Elliott would be "first to go over the trenches," but added the grenades he liked to throw sometimes went off in his hand.</p>
      <p>"I really like him personally but he is a ruthless operator ... he's prepared to go where no one else will go," they said.</p>

      <p>"Luke threw a stone and [David] dropped a bomb on him ... we couldn't believe he did it."</p>
      <p>Mr Elliott says the Liberal Party has been "one of the great constants" in his life, having at 16 announced to his family that he planned to be elected to parliament after joining the Bankstown Young Liberals.</p>

      <p>The grandson of trade unionists says he came to despise the movement after a site he was working on as a teenage labourer was shut down over a lack of salt and pepper, which he said was a "mindless act of thuggery".</p>
      <p>Before embarking on a self-described "unremarkable" military career, the south-west Sydney native worked for the NSW Police media unit.</p>
      <p>In his maiden speech to parliament in 2011, the new member for Baulkham Hills warned those entrusted with enforcing the law must know "they're not above it".</p>
      <p>His ambition to reach Parliament and subsequently the frontbench has earned Mr Elliott both respect and enemies, with several accusing him of doing whatever it takes to advance his interests.</p>
      <p>Another coalition minister said he took no prisoners but "the problem is he applies those same rules to his own side, not just the opposition".</p>
