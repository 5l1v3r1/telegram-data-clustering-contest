      <h1>Nottingham hospitals issue warning as norovirus confirmed on wards</h1>
      <h2>Norovirus, also called the "winter vomiting bug", is a stomach bug that causes vomiting and diarrhoea</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:32:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:32</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Reid</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham University Hospitals Trust has issued a warning to visitors after norovirus was reported on hospital wards.</p>
      <p>The Trust which runs the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/health/">Queen's Medical Centre</a> and Nottingham City Hospital is urging the public not to visit the wards unless they have been free of sickness for more than 72 hours.</p>
      <p>This is to help prevent infections spreading further as <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/health/">norovirus</a> can spread very easily.</p>
      <p>A tweet from NUH at 1pm on Saturday, November 23, said: "We have norovirus on some of our wards.</p>
      <p>"Suffering from norovirus or other common sickness bugs? The best advice is to stay at home and rest. Please avoid visiting any public places such as hospitals, care homes or GP surgeries during and directly after your illness."</p>
      <p>Norovirus, also called the "winter vomiting bug", is a stomach bug that causes vomiting and diarrhoea.</p>
      <p>People may also experience a high temperature of 38C or above, a headache and aching arms and legs.</p>
      <p>The symptoms start suddenly within one to two days of being <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/health/">infected</a>.</p>
      <p>Washing hands frequently with soap is the best way to stop it spreading. Alcohol hand gels don't kill norovirus, the NHS confirmed.</p>
      <p>You can catch norovirus from close contact with someone with the bug, touching surfaces or objects that have the virus on them, then touching your mouth and eating food that's been prepared or handled by someone with norovirus.</p>
