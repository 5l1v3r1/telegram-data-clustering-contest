      <h1>Tesla Cybertruck in Black to be available</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:54:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:54</time> by <a rel="author">Surur</a></address>
      <p>The Tesla Cybertruck is made of Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless-steel which does not need any painting or surface treatment, and it initially appeared that this will be the only option available.</p>
      <p>On twitter today Elon Musk, however, confirmed that at the very least the Tesla Cybertruck will also be available in Matte Black.</p>

      <p>Of course, if it can be available in Black one can assume White will also be an option.</p>
