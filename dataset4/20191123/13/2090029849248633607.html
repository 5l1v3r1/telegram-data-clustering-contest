      <p>According to reports, the incident happened on Monday when the student resumed for school two weeks after her mates had resumed from the Mid-term break.</p>
      <p>However, unknown to her teachers, her mother was watching but did not identify herself.</p>
      <p>Trouble started when she attempted to drag the girl out of the school and the security man (not knowing she was the mother) challenged her. The mother reacted by attacking the security guard.</p>
      <p>The source said:</p>
      <blockquote>“The girl was returning to school two weeks after the mid-term had ended. When the teachers saw her with eyelashes and painted nails, they asked her to kneel down. Her mother came in with her, sat down and listened but did not say anything. Someone heard her telling her daughter in Igbo that she should run away. But the girl refused. After the third time, the mother grabbed the girl’s bag and made to leave. The girl then called out, ‘Mummy where are you going?’<br/><br/>“When people realised that she was the girl’s mother, she quickly dragged the girl out. The security man did not did not know it was the girl’s mother dragging her out. In an attempt to ask why she was taking one of our students out, that was when she attacked the security man.<br/><br/>“The girl was even remorseful. She was asking the mother why she was disgracing her.”</blockquote>
      <p>The source said the girl was returned to school by her mother on Tuesday and would face disciplinary measures.</p>
      <blockquote>“The woman came to drop the girl around 5am in the morning urging her to sneak into her class. But the girl did not sneak. She stood by the security gate till morning and presented herself to the school management. A man who claimed to be her father came to the school to apologise on her behalf but we found out that he is not her father.<br/><br/>“She will face the disciplinary committee. Many people – including the state, are now interested in the case. So we are investigating,” he said.</blockquote>
