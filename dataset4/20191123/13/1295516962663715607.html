      <p><i>The Expanse</i> originally aired on Syfy, but was <a href="https://www.cbr.com/expanse-canceled-syfy/">canceled by the network in May 2018</a> after three seasons. Syfy cited low ratings and high production costs as reasons for why the show, despite its critical acclaim and Nebula Award win, was axed. <a href="https://www.cbr.com/amazon-expanse-renewed-season-4/">Amazon later picked up the series</a> for a fourth season, with executive producer Naren Shankar noting that the show no longer had content restrictions and would film natively in 4K UHD. <a href="https://www.cbr.com/expanse-amazon-prime-season-5-renewed/">A fifth season</a> is already planned.</p>
      <p>Adapting the novel series of the same name by James S.A. Corey, <a href="https://screenrant.com/expanse-season-4-cast-interview/">The Expanse</a> stars Steven Strait, Cas Anvar, Dominique Tipper, Wes Chatham, Shohreh Aghdashloo and Frankie Adams. Season 4 premieres on Amazon Prime Dec. 13.</p>
