      <p>TORONTO — Alessia Cara says getting recognition at this year’s Canada’s Walk of Fame gala event ranks among the most tremendous honours she’s received in her career.</p>
      <p>“I feel like getting acknowledged by your own country in this way is huge,” the 23-year-old performer said on the red carpet before she received the special 2019 Allan Slaight Music Impact honour on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>“It’s one of those things where I’m going to have to see it to actually believe it.”</p>
      <p>The Grammy and Juno award-winning pop singer was among a group of Canadians being recognized for excellence in their respected fields, which include science, sports, entertainment and business. They will each be given stars in Toronto’s entertainment district.</p>
      <p>Eight other influential names were added to Canada’s Walk of Fame during the event, including architect Frank Gehry, hockey player Mark Messier, investor Jim Treliving, and speed skater Cindy Klassen.</p>
      <p>“When I look at all the inductees, these are Canadians that have made such a difference in the world,” Klassen said.</p>
      <p>“It’s incredible to be a part of that, a very humbling experience.”</p>
      <p>Fellow inductee Will Arnett, whose work on “Arrested Development” and “Bojack Horseman” has ushered him into the echelons of comedy fame, said he’s honoured the organizers considered him worthy — but he has a few suggestions for future ceremonies to spice up the Canadiana.</p>
      <p>First, he’d change their name to “The Sorrys,” and that’s only the start.</p>
      <p>“Instead of just a regular tuxedo, if we wore Canadian tuxedos that would be better,” he said, pitching the combo of denim jeans and jackets.</p>
      <p>As for the red carpet? He’d like to see a Zamboni crawling across it before the big show.</p>
      <p>“They should have an ice carpet. Had nobody thought of an ice carpet? I can’t understand why.”</p>
      <p>Triumph guitarist Rik Emmett said he was amused when he learned the rock band’s star would be near a stretch of King Street West where generations of his family worked in the Canadian Pacific Express building where Roy Thomson Hall now resides.</p>
      <p>“Not only my dad worked there, but my grandfather worked there, my great uncles and my great grandfather,” he said.</p>
      <p>“So, it’s very special.”</p>
      <p>Posthumous honours went to children’s entertainer Ernie Coombs, known by many families as TV host Mr. Dressup, and James Naismith, who invented the game of basketball.</p>
      <p>A telecast of the 2019 Canada’s Walk of Fame Awards airs Dec. 15 on CTV and will be available to stream through Crave on Dec. 20.</p>
