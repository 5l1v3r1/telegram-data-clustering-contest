      <p>Galaxy S11e CAD render leak shows similarity with S11<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>Just yesterday, we got our first glimpse at the design of the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S11 in the form of 3D CAD renders, courtesy of well-known gadgets leaker @OnLeaks. And now, we are exposed to the design of Galaxy S11e in a similar manner, again thanks to the same tipster.</p>
      <p>According to the 3D CAD renders by @OneLeaks in <a href="https://pricebaba.com/blog/samsung-galaxy-s11e-renders-360-degree-video-exclusive">partnership</a> with Pricebaba, the forthcoming Galaxy S11e will arrive in a completely new avatar than its predecessor Galaxy S10e. The phone will sport a 6.3-inches curved display at the front with a punch-hole located at the top centre following the footsteps of the Galaxy Note10 series. Also, the fingerprint sensor could be residing under the display as it is nowhere to be seen. In contrast, the 2019 Galaxy S10e features a flat display with a side-mounted fingerprint sensor.</p>
      <p>Talking about the rear design, the device will come equipped with three cameras and an LED flash arranged in a vertical manner at the top left corner similar to that of already available Galaxy M30s and recently leaked Galaxy A71 and Galaxy S11. This will be a step-up from its predecessor which has a dual-camera setup including an ultra-wide sensor.</p>
      <p>Other than the above-mentioned characteristics, the left side of the phone will be completely clean without any buttons, whereas the right side will include a power key and volume rockers. Which means, no more Bixby key anymore, isnâ€™t it great? Aside from that, the top of the device will only have a secondary mic and the bottom part will house a USB Type-C port with a single speaker grille and primary mic on its either sides.</p>

      <p>The Galaxy S11e will measure 151.7 x 69.1mm in size with 7.9mm thickness without considering the camera bump. Else, the thickness will be 9.1mm suggesting the bump to be larger. We can except the device to be unveiled in March 2020 with Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 or Exynos 990 powering it based on the regions it will be sold.</p>
