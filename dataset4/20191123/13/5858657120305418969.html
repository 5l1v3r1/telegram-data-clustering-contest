      <p>VANCOUVER (NEWS 1130) — A report that will go before <a href="https://council.vancouver.ca/20191126/documents/p1.pdf">Vancouver city council</a> Tuesday contains new recommendations to get more rentals in the city quickly.</p>
      <p>Among them, a proposal to streamline the application process for developers and eliminate public hearings for new rentals along major arteries.</p>
      <p>Bruce Gilmour, President of the <a href="http://dunbar-vancouver.org/home-2/">Dunbar Residents’ Association</a>, is strongly in favour of the proposed changes as he says his neighbourhood is in crisis.</p>
      <p>“It’s now turning into a ghost town. Stores are closing and the stores are closing because the pedestrian traffic is declining and there’s just a sense of disempowerment,” he says.</p>
      <p>Gilmour adds he doesn’t blame developers for trying to turn a profit so it’s up to the city to push them toward providing more accessible rental housing.</p>

      <p>“We’ve lived here for 30 years. We’ve raised a child. When I am starting to bump into people on the street who are saying they are ‘gutted’ by what’s happening, I’m not going to say it’s all the developers’ fault. I would say the fingers go back to the City of Vancouver,” he says, adding he’s saddened by the loss of a sense of community within Dunbar, due in large part to a lack of accessible housing.</p>
      <p>Even though he supports the proposal, Gilmour says major steps should have been taken sooner.</p>
      <p>“People are being gutted and people are wanting to move. The neighbourhood values the sense of engagement and connection is being ripped apart,” he explains.</p>
      <p>Gilmour says he believes regardless of the neighbourhood, most people are open to rezoning proposals.</p>
      <p>“We are all getting to a place where we understand we need more places for people to live. We are not going to be NIMBY here. We recognize that change is on its way,” he says.</p>
