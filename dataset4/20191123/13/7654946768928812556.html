      <p>Jeffrey Epstein’s former gal pal and alleged madam used her billionaire father’s wealth and aristocratic connections to throw wild parties, featuring caviar, champagne and beautiful women in a bid to gain favor with the upper crust.</p>
      <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, the “favorite” child of press baron Robert Maxwell, was such a prolific party planner that she was known as “Goodtimes Ghislaine” in London and New York, said a source who attended the soirees.</p>
      <p>“She was a huge networker at these bashes, going from famous person to famous person and introducing people who didn’t have a prior connection to each other,” the source <a href="http://thesun.co.uk/news/10395886/epstein-madam-ghislaine-maxwell-milked-billionaire-dad-and-threw-lavish-parties-with-beautiful-women/">told Britain’s The Sun newspaper</a>.</p>
      <p>In addition to throwing lavish parties, which featured the finest champagnes, platters of foie gras, seafood and imported meats and cheeses, Maxwell is accused of procuring underage girls for sex with Epstein and a coterie of his famous friends, including Prince Andrew. Last week, the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/prince-andrew-kicked-out-of-buckingham-palace-over-jeffrey-epstein-scandal/">British royal was effectively fired</a> from his royal duties over his connection to Epstein, a convicted pedophile who died in a Manhattan lockup in August.</p>
      <p>“It’s very clear she milked that card of being closely connected to the British aristocracy for all it was worth,” said the source. “The message she liked to convey was that if anyone wanted to make the scene as an upper crust socialite, they had to be on her good side or they wouldn’t be invited to these kind of exclusive events.”</p>
      <p>Aspiring celebrities and business people knew that if “Ghislaine was in their company they’d meet anyone important who was around, because they just gravitated towards her,” said the source. “It clearly went to her head because she had this air about her that was almost regal.”</p>
      <p>Robert Maxwell, who died in 1991 under mysterious circumstances on the yacht he named for his daughter — the “Lady Ghislaine” — was described as a controlling parent who refused to allow her to bring home dates when she was in college for fear that any man who got close to her was a gold-digger, a family friend told The Sun.</p>
      <p>At her 21st birthday party, he shut off the electricity at his mansion at 11 p.m. because he did not like her choice of music, according to the friend.</p>
