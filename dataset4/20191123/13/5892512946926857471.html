      <p>Two of the Heavyweight division’s most fearsome punchers will run back their 2018 classic tonight (Sat., Nov. 23, 2019) when Deontay Wilder and Luis Ortiz throw leather inside MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Wilder (41-0-1, 40 KO) and Ortiz (31-1, 26 KO) put on a show in March of last year, culminating in a dramatic 10th-round knockout in a fight that saw Wilder fight back from the direst straits of his career. Whoever wins likely has a date with Tyson Fury early next year.</p>
      <p>In the co-main, three-division champion Leo Santa Cruz (36-1-1, 19 KO) looks to make it four against wholly undeserving challenger Miguel Flores (24-2, 12 KO). It’s a stupid fight for a stupid title and I refuse to give it the time of day.</p>
      <p>Far more appealing are the two opening bouts. In one, Bantamweight wrecking machine <s>Luis Nery (30-0, 24 KO) looks for his 12th consecutive knockout against top-10 contender Emmanuel Rodriguez (19-1, 12 KO)</s>*, while the other sees fringe super bantamweight champion Brandon Figueroa (20-0, 15 KO) make his first defense against Mexican knockout artist Julio Ceja (32-4, 28 KO).</p>
      <p>*Nery wound up missing weight, resulting in the fight’s cancellation. The undercard rematch between Leduan Barthelemy (15-0-1, 7 KO) and Eduardo Ramirez (22-2-3, 9 KO) will now open the broadcast.</p>

      <h3>“Wilder Vs. Ortiz II” Round-by-Round Coverage:</h3>
      <h4>Heavyweight Championship: Deontay Wilder vs. Luis Ortiz</h4>
      <p>Round one: Ortiz fires a left hand downstairs, looks for a low-high combo. Right hand to the body. Wilder working behind the jab, eats an overhand left halfway through the round. Clinch. Wilder whiffs on a right hand, takes a left in return. 1-2 from Ortiz. Strong start for the Cuban. <b>10-9 Ortiz.</b></p>
      <p>Round two: Ortiz sporting a cut from a clash of heads. Wilder still teasing with the jab. Ortiz looks for body shots. Wilder 1-2 blocked, Ortiz sends out a series of jabs. Left hook by Wilder. Both miss with lefts near the ropes. Halfway through. Wilder sends out some feints, takes a body shot. Solid jabs. Ortiz finds the mark with a lead left. Wilder body jab. <b>10-9, 20-18 Ortiz.</b></p>
      <p>Round three: Still not many power punches from Wilder. Both throw lefts downstairs, Ortiz lands a straight upstairs. Ortiz with another body shot on the ropes. Halfway through. Ortiz overhand left blocked, body shots are not. Counter hook catches Wilder throwing. More lefts. <b>10-9, 30-27 Ortiz.</b></p>
      <p>Round four: Wilder’s always weirdly gunshy, but he’s really just letting Ortiz dictate everything. Ortiz lands some good shots in the corner. Ortiz slips a right hand, cracks Wilder with some lefts that have the champ pounding his chest in response. Ortiz patiently advancing as Wilder throws noncommittal jabs. Wilder throws a hard right, blocked by a forearm. <b>10-9, 40-36 Ortiz.</b></p>
      <p>Round five: Ortiz continues to press forward, lands another left upstairs. Again, Wilder pretty much exclusively using the jab and not to any great effect. 1-2 downstairs from Ortiz. Wilder tries a 1-2-3, misses. Halfway through. Ortiz to the body. Long left falls short. Now some jabs from the Cuban. Wilder tries a couple of swatting hooks. Ortiz backs him to the ropes, 1-1-2 downstairs. Wilder looks pissed from a rabbit punch and tries a few heavy shots. Ortiz with a check hook. <b>10-9, 50-45 Ortiz.</b></p>
      <p>Round six: Ortiz with some early combination work. He’s winning the lead-foot battle. 1-2 connects. Jab exchange. Halfway through. More Wilder jabs. They trade lead hands near the center. Ortiz combination doesn’t land clean, jabs do. <b>10-9, 60-54 Ortiz.</b></p>
      <p>Round seven: Ortiz lands an early straight left. He throws some bigger ones near the ropes, lands one. I’m not sure Wilder has landed more than 10 power punches the whole fight. Wilder lead right. Halfway through. Wilder with a looping right. Now he’s throwing a bit more. Left hook downstairs. Ortiz doubles up the left and cracks Wilder, following up with body shots. Overhand left glances off. Suddenly, Wilder hurls a 1-2 that splits Ortiz’s guard and puts him on his back. Ortiz takes too long to stand for the ref’s liking and it’s over.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Final result: Wilder def. Ortiz by KO</i>
