      <p>Earlier in a tweet, Norway’s Ambassador Kjell-Gunnar Eriksen wrote “The Norwegian government strongly disapproves of the Quran burning in the right-wing demonstration in Kristiansand. The police stopped the demonstration for security reasons. In Norway everyone has the right to free speech and to practice their religion without being harassed”.</p>
