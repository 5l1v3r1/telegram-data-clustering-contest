      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/katie-price/">Katie Price</a> and Kris Boyson are apparently on the rocks again, as the former glamour model suffers another terrible week.</p>
      <p>It comes after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/katie-prices-bright-pink-range-rover-gets-repossessed-almost-declaring-bankruptcy-11196962/">her iconic pink Range Rover was repossessed due to her unpaid debts</a>, and was put up for sale at a car dealership in Chelmsford.</p>
      <p>A source told The Sun: ‘They want to make it work but no-one would be surprised if they went their separate ways soon.</p>
      <p>‘Katie’s had a terrible week and it has spilled over to rows with Kris.’</p>
      <p>The pair were also photographed appearing to have an argument in the street during date night, where Kris was seen walking away from Katie as she followed on behind.</p>
      <p>The tension in their relationship is said to be caused by her mounting money worries, as her £75,000 car was taken away to cover some of her debts.</p>

      <p>It’s also claimed that she didn’t have a chance to take her CDs out of the car or clean the vehicle before it was repossessed and sold at a car auction, before appearing on the forecourt of Saxton 4×4 in Chelmsford.</p>

      <p>The source added: ‘Katie’s had a terrible week and it has spilled over to rows with Kris. Losing her car absolutely hit her for six.</p>
      <p>‘She knew it could happen but was hoping the people she is paying to try and sort out her debts would stop it.</p>
      <p>‘So she was blindsided when it was taken away and didn’t expect it. She didn’t have a chance to clean it or get any of the stuff like her CDs and other keepsakes in there out of it. She has been asking for all the stuff back.’</p>

      <p>Kris, 31, and Katie, 41, are said to be in a ‘make or break’ stage of their relationship after he ended up on the end of her frustrations over the loss of her car.</p>
      <p>The source added: ‘Katie’s money problems have always been there but she seems to be getting a lot more stressed about it all at the moment and it has led to rows with Kris.</p>

      <p>‘They both desperately want to try and make it work but the next couple of weeks look like make or break for them. No would be surprised if they’d broken up by Christmas.’</p>
      <p>Here’s hoping they can work it out.</p>
