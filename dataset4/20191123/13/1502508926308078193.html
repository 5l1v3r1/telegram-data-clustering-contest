      <p>Researchers have developed a novel artificial intelligence (AI) based method to determine which lung-cancer patients may benefit from an expensive treatment called immunotherapy, an advance that may help reduce health care costs for underprivileged cancer patients.</p>
      <p>The study, published in the journal Cancer Immunology Research, noted that the AI system can assess the scans taken when lung cancer is first diagnosed in a patient, and compare it to scans taken after the first 2-3 cycles of treatment to find changes.</p>
      <p>The researchers, including those from the Case Western Reserve University in the US, used an X-ray imaging equipment called a CT scan to probe into tissue samples from 50 patients.</p>
      <p>Using these scans, they trained the AI system to create an algorithm for identifying changes in the lung-cancer lesion.</p>
      <p>The researchers said currently only about 20 per cent of all cancer patients benefit from immunotherapy -- which is a treatment that uses drugs to help one's own immune system to fight cancer, as opposed to chemotherapy drugs which directly target and kill cancer cells.</p>
      <p>"Even though immunotherapy has changed the entire ecosystem of cancer, it also remains extremely expensive--about $200,000 per patient, per year," said study co-author Anant Madabhushi from the Case Western Reserve University.</p>
      <p>"That's part of the financial toxicity that comes along with cancer and results in about 42 per cent of all new diagnosed cancer patients losing their life savings within a year of diagnosis," he added.</p>
      <p>Madabhushi said the new tool can do a better job of matching up which patients will respond to immunotherapy, "instead of throwing $800,000 down the drain".</p>
      <p>According to the researchers, one of the significant advances in the research was the AI tool's ability to spot the changes in texture, volume and shape of a cancer lesion, not just its size -- which they said is often the only parameter used by doctors to identify cancerous growths.</p>
      <p>The scientists said the results were consistent across scans of patients treated at two different sites, and with three different types of immunotherapy drugs.</p>
