      <p>Official talks with island communities on how to safeguard their future are “long overdue”, one island representative has said.</p>
      <p>The Government launched a three-month public consultation with islanders on Saturday, vowing it would lead to the first national policy on offshore islands for almost a quarter of a century.</p>
      <p>Marjorie Uí Cearbhaill, manager of the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Tory+island">Tory island</a> co-op/Comharchumann Thoraí in Co <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Donegal">Donegal</a>, said it was a long time coming and there was little confidence in it being completed anytime soon.</p>
      <p>“It is well overdue,” she said.</p>
      <p>“My God, 23 years since the last national policy. People say I wonder will we ever see it. When it comes to the islands, in the past we have been promised a lot of things, and they get very little. But I hope this will be fulfilled.”</p>
      <p>The Government has said the voices and views of islanders will be “central” to the consultation with workshops held with island communities over the winter.</p>
      <p>Local groups and individuals have been promised “direct input as the policy is developed.”</p>
      <p>But Ms Uí Cearbhaill said she “can’t imagine (the policy) will be done anytime soon”.</p>
      <p>“Anything you are doing with the Department (of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht), it is very very slow to get anything done.</p>
      <p>“Eventually you get there, but there is so much red tape you have to go through. It takes a lot of time, so people get very frustrated with that. From our own experience, everything seems to take a very long time.”</p>
      <h3>Broadband</h3>
      <p>Ms Uí Cearbhaill, who has represented Tory islanders in an ongoing bitter dispute over a new ferry service, said high speed broadband access and tourism were key issues the Government needs to address to make island life sustainable in modern <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news">Ireland</a>.</p>
      <p>“We would get a lot, lot more people moving back to the islands if we could get the broadband up and running,” she said.</p>
      <p>“There has been talk about it, but there has been talk of a lot of things over the years. At this stage, that would be one of our main aims.”</p>
      <p>A high-speed digital hub which opened on neighbouring <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Arranmore">Arranmore</a> island earlier this year has raised hopes of breathing new life into its ageing population and attracting back those who have left.</p>
      <p>On Tory, internet access often cuts out, said Ms Uí Cearbhaill.</p>
      <p>“In years gone by there was a knitting factory on Tory island, but those days are gone - we have to move with the times,” she said.</p>
      <p>“There are companies in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Letterkenny">Letterkenny</a> we could work along with to set up employment schemes where people could work from the islands, if we have the broadband. It would definitely boost the population again.”</p>
      <p>While the full-time population fell from 169 in 1996 to 119 in 2016, a recent count puts the number living on Tory at 146. Ms Uí Cearbhaill said there has been a “baby boom” in recent years.</p>
      <p>Just under 30 per cent of Tory’s population are in employment, according to the 2016 census.</p>
      <p>The island is also working on a feasibility study for its lighthouse to become a tourist attraction. Tourism, said Ms Uí Cearbhaill, would be the other key driver for the future of offshore islands.</p>
      <h3>‘Unique asset’</h3>
      <p>There are around 30 inhabited islands around Ireland, mostly off the western counties including Cork, Donegal, Galway and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Mayo">Mayo</a>.</p>
      <p>Launching the government public consultation, on Sherkin Island, Co Cork, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Simon+Coveney">Simon Coveney</a> said there has been “significant capital investment” on the islands in recent years.</p>
      <p>But he added that talks with islanders were needed “to ensure communities are supported in a sustainable way into the future.</p>
      <p>“Our islands are a unique asset and there are many different stories of new industry and tourism that have been successfully developed on some islands,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We now need to hear from our island communities on what enterprise, education and unique supports they need.”</p>
