      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls">Chicago Bulls</a> leading scorer <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064440/zach-lavine">Zach LaVine</a> says he senses a lack of trust from coach Jim Boylen after the guard was temporarily pulled in the first quarter of Friday's loss to the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat">Miami Heat</a>.</p>
      <p>"I'm trying my best, I'll say that," LaVine told Yahoo Sports after the 116-108 loss to the Heat. "I'm playing my minutes and trying to do the best I can do. It's tough, especially when you're in a rut. If he doesn't trust me, it's hard to trust someone who doesn't trust you."</p>
      <p>Boylen removed LaVine midway through the first quarter after the Bulls fell behind 13-0. LaVine stayed out for more than five minutes before returning to the floor.</p>
      <p>"I just pulled him. Not combative. Guys know. Zach LaVine and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066336/lauri-markkanen">Lauri Markkanen</a> and our starters got to play better for us to become what we can become. That's how it works," Boylen told reporters. "I want him to be a two-way player. That's what I want him to be."</p>
      <p>LaVine said he thought he was used as a scapegoat for the Bulls' struggles.</p>
      <p>"I guess I was to blame for it," LaVine told reporters. "I've gotten pulled early before by him. I guess that's just his thing to do. Just got to take it in stride. I'm not the coach."</p>

      <p>He expanded on his thoughts to Yahoo Sports, saying everyone around the team -- including the coaching staff -- needs to improve and that Boylen shouldn't single out players.</p>
      <p>LaVine said he will try to build the trust back up with Boylen or at least find a middle ground.</p>
      <p>"We talk a lot. We need to have a sit-down talk? Maybe. Maybe we should," LaVine said. "I think he's a direct guy. We'll figure out a time and place to do it and see where we see eye to eye at."</p>
      <p>The 5-11 Bulls face the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cha/charlotte-hornets">Charlotte Hornets</a> on Saturday.</p>
