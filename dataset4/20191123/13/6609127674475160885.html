      <p>And he said that ex-Ibrox and Scotland defender Eric Caldow is engraved on his father’s grave.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18046526.rod-stewart-my-oldest-brother-rangers-fan-rangers-player-engraved-dads-grave/">Speaking to The Herald</a>, he said: “My oldest brother is a Rangers fan and has been all his life.</p>
      <p>“We don’t have fights about it. There’s a Rangers player engraved on my dad’s grave, Eric Caldow, Robert must have wangled that!”</p>
      <p>Ahead of legendary Sir Rod’s SSE Hydro gigs next week, he said he feels like “one half” of Glasgow loves him.</p>
      <p>He said: “I feel at home there and loved by one half of the city perhaps.</p>
      <p>“I sometimes wonder if Rangers supporters stay away but like my music.”</p>
      <p>In September <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4723842/rod-stewart-secret-cancer-prostate-battle/">the Hoops fan revealed he’d beaten prostate cancer</a> after a secret three-year battle with the illness.</p>
      <p>He was diagnosed in February 2016 after a routine appointment and at the time he urged men to check their prostates after going into remission.</p>
      <p>He said: “I never felt any different [during the illness]. I had treatment for two years and I was working all through that time.</p>
      <p>“I went to Harley Street five times a week for a month and no one ever found out, which was a miracle really but I wanted people to know because it’s a horrible cancer to have.</p>
      <p>“It gives you no warning whatsoever. You go to your doctor and get a finger up the bum and no harm done.</p>
      <p>“That’s why I came out with it; to help other people. I couldn't be fitter than I am right now.”</p>
      <p>We revealed recently that <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4965221/rod-stewart-sex-virginity-maggie-may/">Rod's first ever romp that inspired hit song Maggie May</a> lasted just four seconds.</p>
      <p>And the singer also revealed that <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/fabulous/4963881/rod-stewart-football-celtic-saved-drink-drugs/">playing football saved him from the rocker lifestyle</a> of drink and drugs.</p>
