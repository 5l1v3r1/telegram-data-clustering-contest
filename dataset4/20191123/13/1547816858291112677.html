        <b>Paras Chhabra is the MOST DESPERATE to win Bigg Boss 13. TV circles abuzz with fingers being pointed at him asking questions</b>
      </p>
      <p>Who doesn't play to win, unless a parent is playing with a child and he/she deliberately loses to see his child's face lit up with joy? So, every contestant out there in Bigg Boss 13 has entered to win the big trophy, which in turn will give them big money and probably more fame. Those who tell us that they were inside for a lark are just putting up a brave front.</p>
      <p>But, when the urge to win makes you stoop to the lowest level, we think that the urge in question is not ambition or keenness but sheer desperation. That's just the word that is being used for the Bigg Boss 13 contestant Paras Chhabra, Pavitra Punia's ex and Akanksha Puri's current boyfriend.</p>

      <p>TV industry corridors are buzzing that Paras hit rock-bottom in morals and ethics when he jamaoed a mehfil to run down Pavitra. Is this the way you talk about someone with whom you were in a relationship? Is this the way you mock at someone who treated your parents with respect? Is this the way you ridicule someone who invested her feelings and trust in you? That too on national television, not that at any other place deserves less condemnation? These are the questions being ASKED and not whispered.</p>
      <p>We had broken that <a href="http://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-paras-chhabra-treats-his-ex-girlfriend-pavitra-punia-shabbily-tells-contestants-she-covers-my-tattoo-but-it-s-actually-her-ex-fiance-s-exclusive/5dd29bed87fb571eff7e40b0">big story to you where Paras spoke about Pavitra's meeting with his parents in Bigg Boss 13</a> without naming her. Mahira Sharma, Devoleena Bhattacharjee and Arti Singh were in attendance. Paras had made quite a joke of how coyly Pavitra met them and even said (falsely) that Pavitra covered up her tattoo of his name after they broke up.</p>

We are sure that Paras does not have the good wishes of Pavitra, her well-wishers and even the people who have no interest in movies and TV shows but believe that what is right is right and what is wrong is wrong.<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- instagram/pavitrapunia_/parasvchhabra</i></p>
