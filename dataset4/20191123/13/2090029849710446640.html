      <p>The Senator representing Niger East Senatorial district in Niger State is reported to have plagiarized the same speech from Singapore word for word, despite earning N13.5million monthly.</p>
      <p>According to a social media report by a <i>twitter user </i>identified as Jackson, who also reacted to hate speech bill that has passed the second reading, the bill was outrightly copied from the Asian country</p>
      <p>He wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>“at the end of the day, the Hate speech bill was copied from Singapore word for word by brain dead senator Sani Musa who earn N13.5 Million monthly for being stupid!. Soon, Nigerians who hailed Buhari and APC would know what they have done to themselves.”</blockquote>

      <p>For purposes of clarity, it’s important to state that there are actually two bills out there agitating the minds of social media users in Nigeria at the moment.</p>
      <p>There is the ‘Hate Speech Bill’ and the ‘Social Media Bill’. Both bills are not one and the same, even though they have been conflated in discourses on the internet.</p>
      <p>The hate speech bill, otherwise called the ‘Prohibition of Hate Speech Bill’ is being championed by Sen. Sabi Abdullahi (APC, Deputy Chief Whip), while the social media bill, otherwise called the ‘Internet Falsehood and Manipulation Bill’ is the brainchild of Sen. Mohammed Sani Musa.</p>
