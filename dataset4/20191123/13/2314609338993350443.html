      <h1>Friends in high places can’t deny a win for the people</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:15:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author">Peter FitzSimons</a></address>
      <p>Bravo, bravo, bravo. As predicted by this column, the Independent Planning Commission did indeed announce its decision last week that the proposed 237-metre tower above The Star in Pyrmont - eight times higher than the current building code allows - was "overly obtrusive" and should not be allowed to proceed.</p>
      <p>Could it possibly have come to any other conclusion? What would it do to the rest of Sydney's CBD if such a precedent were set?</p>

      <p>The IPC rightly rejected the plans for the 66-storey building, saying it was "inconsistent with current strategic planning for the site and locality and fails to promote the orderly use and development of land", which broadly put it in complete agreement with the Department of Planning, Industry and Environment's own original rejection of the plan.</p>
      <p>And yes, the Berejiklian government has already vowed to fight against this the decision of sanity - it's a bit like that, particularly at the top and most particularly when Big Business is involved - but this was an initial great victory for the people.</p>
      <h3>Christmas jeer</h3>
      <p>I don't get it. Here we are in the last week of November and I am yet to see the annual slew of stories about schools, councils, shopping centres et al TRYING TO SHUT DOWN CHRISTMAS!</p>
      <p>Yes, that might be because there has been no room for such stories, with all the stories about dreadful bushfires and staggering revelations on Prince Andrew, but this week, I am sure, the tradition will be observed.</p>
      <p>I predict it will start from an obscure council minute or a decision from a single primary school about a nativity play and build into a tsunami of rants focused on "the woke", Muslims in general, and probably the Greenies who will have taken time off causing the bushfires to destroy Christmas on the way home.</p>
      <p>Watch this space. I am talking ... days.</p>
      <h3>Prince on another planet</h3>
      <p>The Prince Andrew thing? It was, obviously, appalling on so many succeeding levels - each one more gobsmacking than the last - it was like being on a slippery dip into the depths of dimwittery.</p>
      <p>For me the most cogent comment on the whole affair came from my brilliant cousin, Angus: "It was like leaning forwards as you watch a documentary on a just-discovered tribe lost in the jungle - 'Wow, they <i>really</i> believe all that.' "</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In this case, of course, straight after leaning forward we reeled back in horror. If there has been a better character sketch of a privileged ponce, with an overarching sense of entitlement and no clue of responsibility, blithely unaware of how the actual world works - more gobsmacked that he'd been to a pizza joint, than that he had consorted with a paedophile - I haven't seen it.</p>
      <p>Our first thoughts, of course, must be with the victims of that convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. It must have been agony for them to see one of his enablers publicly describing Epstein's rape of minors as "unbecoming", while expressing not an ounce of his own regret.</p>
      <p>But it is equally obvious that, to judge from the many emails, tweets and interview requests I have fielded this week as chair of the Australian Republic Movement, it has set Australia thinking about the sheer absurdity of having our whole system of government locked into a foreign family of titled and entitled privilege that can produce a man like him.</p>
      <p>Oh, do stop screaming, and answer the simple question: do you actually think that Prince Andrew is the eighth most qualified person to be Australia's head of state? I look forward to your replies.</p>
      <h3>Freedom to ignore facts</h3>
      <p>As one who has lived in Ohio for a year in the late '70s, I am fully aware of just how religious it is, with my adopted home of Findlay having more than 70 churches for a population under 50,000 - one of which, First Presbyterian, I reluctantly was obliged to attend every Sunday.</p>
      <p>But even I was gobsmacked to read this week that Ohio's legislative chamber has just passed the Ohio Student Religious Liberties Act of 2019 which, among other things, will "prohibit public schools from rewarding or penalising a student based on the religious content of a student's homework, artwork or other assignments".</p>

      <p>In other words, if critics of the bill like Gary Daniels - chief lobbyist for the American Civil Liberties Union - are correct, it means that if in an exam or homework assignment you give a religious answer instead of a scientific one, you cannot be marked wrong.</p>
      <p>For example, if asked "how old is the world?" you don't have to put down 4.5 billion to 5 billion years, but could give the creationist nonsense of 6000 years old and be legislatively protected.</p>
      <p>Thank goodness we in Australia are not going down the whole path of legislated religious freed- ... oh, wait!</p>
      <h3>Joke of the Week</h3>
      <p>A woman is talking to a lawyer.</p>
      <p>Woman: "Do you mind if I ask you a question?"</p>
      <p>Lawyer: "Not at all."</p>
      <p>Woman: "How much do you charge to answer a question?"</p>
      <p>Lawyer: "$50 per question."</p>
      <p>Woman: "Thank you."</p>
      <p>Lawyer: "My pleasure. My invoice for $100 will be in the mail."</p>
      <h3>Quotes of the Week</h3>
      <p><b>"To put that in some sort of perspective, in some places in Sydney, it's the equivalent of smoking 40 cigarettes a day." -</b> Professor Brian Oliver of the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, about the smoke over the city on Tuesday.</p>
      <p><b>"Frankly, too many of the [royal family] are useless, grating or, in Andrew's case, entirely reprehensible. British taxpayers can't be expected to pay for this mob much longer, and our Australian constitution should not be tied to a monarchy in moral decline." -</b> Janet Albrechtsen, columnist for <i>The Australian</i>.</p>
      <p><b>"I expected a train wreck. That was a plane crashing into an oil tanker, causing a tsunami, triggering a nuclear explosion level bad. #Newsnight #PrinceAndrew." -</b> Royal writer and editor, Charlie Proctor, on the Prince Andrew interview.</p>
      <p><b>"In a carbon-constrained world, Australia should be a winner. This is a massively exciting project with world-changing potential. If we nail this, we can build a new export industry for Australia, create jobs and set our economy up for the future." -</b> Australian billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes, who has joined with Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest to organise a capital raising of "tens of millions of dollars" to build a huge solar farm in Australia to supply electricity to Singapore.</p>
      <p><b>"[The development would] result in unacceptable built form, including a tower of a height which is overly obtrusive and that will result in unreasonable and unacceptable impacts with respect to view loss, visual impact, and overshadowing." -</b> The Independent Planning Commission rejecting the The Star's $530 million luxury casino and apartment tower plan, finding it "overly obtrusive".</p>
      <p><b>"In reflecting on my time in Parliament I'm happy I always stuck to my principles and supported proven policy, rather than succumb to the siren call of the victimhood of populism." -</b> Senator Cory Bernardi, announcing his forthcoming retirement - after not being swept into power by the silent majority he was sure were begging for his leadership. Very broadly, in terms of getting to the kind of voters he was looking for, Pauline Hanson ate him for breakfast.</p>
