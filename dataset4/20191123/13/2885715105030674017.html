      <p>The NTA had changed the exam syllabus for all the subjects under the UGC NET last year which will also be followed this year. The revised and detailed syllabus is available at the website. In some cases, only a slight change is made. Candidates who are appearing for the exam should prepare accordingly.</p>
      <p>Till last year, the exam was conducted in two parts â€” paper I and paper II with a gap period in between but the NTA has decided to conduct both papers in one go. As soon as the time allotted for paper-I is over, the paper-II will begin. Earlier, it was said that the exam will be conducted only once a year but the same was rollbacked later.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Agricultural Scientist Recruitment Board (ASRB) has rescheduled the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) National Eligibility Test (NET) 2019.</p>
