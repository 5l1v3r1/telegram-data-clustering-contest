      <p>Anxiety affects all of us at some point in time. While anxiety can be brought on by a wide range of factors and is experienced differently among individuals, exercise has been shown to have a positive effect.</p>
      <p>Research going back as far as late 1980s demonstrated a positive correlation between physical activity and mental health. Good mental health is defined as a positive mood, general well-being, and relatively infrequent symptoms of anxiety and depression. The results after 10 years of study were independent of socio-economic status, age and gender.</p>
      <p>Exercises can also have preventive benefits. A number of research studies have compared exercisers to non-exercises and the results reveal a greater reduction in anxiety among people who exercise than those receiving other forms of anxiety-reducing treatment. Overall, exercisers feel an immediate response to what is termed state anxiety, which reflects changes in mood and behaviour in the moment. Physical activity improves energy and a sense of vitality, which reduces the sense of anxiety. The affect seems to be both psychological and neurobiological.</p>
      <p>Your central nervous system is in charge of your “fight or flight” response. In your brain, the hypothalamus gets the ball rolling. It stimulates the adrenal glands to release stress hormones. This is important when there is a state of emergency. Once the threat is gone, the hypothalamus triggers every system of the body to go back to normal. If the fear or stress lingers, the body does not adjust and stays in an elevate state of arousal or stress. Over time, this puts a demand on all aspects of your body, causing fatigue and eventual physical breakdown.</p>
      <p>Physical training stresses the body in a way that the body learns to adapt to greater effort, leading to increased resiliency to physical and emotional stress. This enables people to adapt more easily to difficult situations.</p>
      <p>The mental benefits of exercise have a neurochemical affect. Exercise reduces levels of the body’s stress hormone, such as adrenalin and cortisol. At the same time, it stimulates the production of endorphins, chemicals in the brain that are a natural mood enhancer and painkiller.</p>
      <p>The stress response increases breathing and heart rate, causing rapid, shallow breathing and constricted blood vessels. This affect decreases oxygen delivery to every cell in the body. Less oxygen to the brain decreases clarity and energy. The feeling of fatigue leads to greater stress.</p>
      <p>Under stress, your liver produces more blood sugar or glucose to provide the energy to handle stress. With chronic stress, the body may not be able to handle the heightened blood sugar, leading to Type 2 diabetes.</p>
      <p>Although the exact types of exercise programming are still in question there are numerous activities that have shown great results in managing anxiety. Current research indicates the type of exercise is less important than the act of exercise. Studies comparing cardiovascular activities, strength, stretching, yoga and tai chi have found them equally effective.</p>
      <p>Intensity and duration of exercise have been looked at and it appears all intensities have a positive effect, though greater effects were noted when exercise was performed at moderate to moderately high intensity for longer than 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>Creating a routine of regular exercise is important when it comes to managing anxiety. A pre-exercise state of anxiety will return within 24 hours. Exercise is a buffer and creates greater resiliency to physical and mental stress. Not only are you training your cardiovascular and muscular system to handle more work, you are developing overall resistance to stress.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, how people look at exercise and determine their goals has an effect on the overall sense of well-being. Exercise performed for external motivation, such as physical appearance, has been shown to cause greater anxiety whereas exercise for internal motivation (quality of life) translates to higher levels of satisfaction.</p>
