      <h2>Albion star Hal Robson-Kanu, who is christened Thomas, has explained why he's known to all as 'Hal' - unless it's anything to do with business!</h2>

      <p>In life you won’t come across too many people by the name of Hal.</p>
      <p>Unless you’re a West Bromwich Albion fan, of course, in which case you probably name-check the centre forward as he wears the stripes on any given match-day.</p>
      <p>Why Hal, though? Why Hal, when you take into consideration the fact that he’s actually christened Thomas?</p>
      <p>The Baggies striker, who joined the club on a free transfer after leaving Reading in the summer of 2016, had the question put to him in a sit down interview for the club’s match-day programme ahead of Albion’s welcoming of Sheffield Wednesday to The Hawthorns.</p>

      <p>It turns out that Hal derives from his middle name, rather than his forename.</p>
      <p>“Ahh...well, Hal was a pet name given to me by my grandmother,” Robson-Kanu told the match-day programme.</p>
      <p>“I’m actually christened Thomas Harold and ‘Hal’ is an old English shortening of Harold. So I became Hal around my family, and then, when I went to Arsenal as a 10-year-old it was a name everyone picked up on.</p>

      <p>“By the time I was 16, it was always ‘Hal’ - although it would be ‘THOMAS!!!’ if I was in trouble at home!</p>
      <p>“But it’s actually turned out to be quite useful because I use Thomas still in business and I can separate myself from the football person, so to speak.</p>
      <p>“Mind you, I then get asked if I’ve got a brother who plays football.”</p>
