      <p>According to Feng Shui – flowing water symbolizes income.</p>
      <p>Probably taking the advice too seriously, KOMTAR Penang ‘accidentally’ installed a waterfall when its 61st floor suffered from water leakage causing water to gush down its staircase.</p>
      <p>The video of the incident, which went viral online witnessed a large body of water flowing down and out of the building when everyone was still diligently at work on the premise.</p>
      <p>Here is the video of the incident.</p>

        <video src="https://www.worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/getfvid_78670758_182869736176150_3414959510103300893_n.mp4?_=1"/>

      <p>Reported in <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/11/22/like-a-waterfall-thousands-evacuate-komtar-after-water-leakage?fbclid=IwAR1i_XzCr36GL6qosd4lbdiNeQzaszjpmlowvRiQAvqyAFncOqZ6HKMFWgo">The Star</a>, eyewitnesses say that the incident began when the 61st floor became flooded due to a water leakage during a maintenance work done by the Komtar management.</p>
      <p>According to Mahfuzah Jalaludin, <b>“We were asked to evacuate the building by security personnel at about 12.45 pm.”</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>“We thought it was a fire drill, but when we came out the whole floor was flooded with water.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Clearly unalarmed by the potential dangers, witnesses in the video did the most Malaysian thing they could do during the incident – taking out their phones and capturing it on their cameras.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Malaysians, right?</i>
