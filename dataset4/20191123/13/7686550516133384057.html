      <h1>The electric Welsh rugby teenager Wayne Pivac's being told to invest in now as he makes history</h1>
      <h2>Louis Rees-Zammit, 18, has been nicknamed 'Speedy' by his coach and been backed to shine in Champions Cup</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:28:32+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:28</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Howell</a></address>
      <p>Wales Under-18 sensation Louis Rees-Zammit makes history on Sunday when he becomes the youngest player in Gloucester’s illustrious history to start a European match.</p>
      <p>It will be some occasion for the youngster, with the Cherry and Whites away to star-studded French big-spenders Montpellier in the showpiece Heineken Champions Cup.</p>
      <p>Gloucester head coach Johan Ackermann, in an interview with WalesOnline, advised new Wales boss Wayne Pivac to "invest" in Rees-Zammit.</p>
      <p>He has nicknamed the Cardiff-born player ‘Speedy’ after Rees-Zammit, who will be aged 18 and 295 days when he takes the field at the Altrad Stadium on Sunday, clocked blistering times in sprint training.</p>
      <p>That beats the previous mark of 18 years and 326 days set by James Simpson-Daniel in a Heineken Cup semi-final defeat to Leicester Tigers in 2001.</p>
      <p>Rees-Zammit last season set a record when he came on as a substitute against Bath to become the youngest player to appear for Gloucester in the English Premiership.</p>

      <p>He only stepped up to Gloucester’s senior academy from its Under-18 section during the summer but has quickly made a mark.</p>
      <p>Rees-Zammit scored two tries in two Premiership Rugby Cup starts and has recorded the fastest sprint times in training.</p>
      <p>The Llandaff RFC product demonstrated that searing pace with a blistering run when he came on against Toulouse for his European debut last week.</p>
      <p>Rees-Zammit was a late addition to the substitutes bench for that game as Ollie Thorley was ruled out by injury and was picked ahead of the experienced Charlie Sharples.</p>

      <p>His selection for the clash with Montpellier, where he will go up directly against Fiji juggernaut Nemani Nadolo, is further proof of how highly he is rated by Ackermann.</p>
      <p>“It’s part of our process. We have to believe he’s at that level that he can play and Louis is obviously one of those,” said the former lock, who lifted the 2007 World Cup with South Africa.</p>
      <p>“I heard a lot about him. I saw him play in the Gloucester-Leicester under-18 final last season and he scored a try from his half.</p>

      <p>“We had an A League game against Bristol last season and he played in that. He scored <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/welsh-teenager-just-scored-unbelievable-16065155">a try from the kick-off</a> , he swerved everybody.</p>
      <p>“During pre-season, we got four or five young boys who had just joined our academy to train with us and he was one of them.</p>
      <p>“He trained well and had the first few games for us with Charlie Sharples and Ollie Thornley not ready. He was tremendous in the one game.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of things he can still learn and improve as an 18-year-old but we’re excited about his talent and what he’s got.</p>
      <p>“He’s somebody who, if I was Wales, I would look to invest in because I think he’s got the ability.</p>
      <p>“He’s big, has got pace, skill and is a confident lad who speaks well. He’s got a belief about himself and, if he keeps level-headed, I see a bright future for him.</p>
      <p>“The one thing I do believe in the modern game is a big advantage is for outside backs is speed and he’s got a lot of that.”</p>
