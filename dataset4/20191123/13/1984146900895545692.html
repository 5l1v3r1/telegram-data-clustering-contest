      <h2>Newcastle United head coach Steve Bruce hopes to eventually find a talented young British player after previously working with John McGinn, Harry Maguire, Andrew Robertson and Jarrod Bowen</h2>

      <p>Steve Nickson and his scouting team at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United </a>will eventually be tasked with finding a talented British youngster by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a>.</p>
      <p>The Magpies made five first-team signings last summer - <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/joelinton">Joelinton</a>, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/allan-saint-maximin">Allan Saint-Maximin</a>, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jetro-willems">Jetro Willems</a>, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/emil-krafth">Emil Krafth</a> and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/andy-carroll">Andy Carroll</a> - and looked at a host of players aged 25 and under in Europe.</p>
      <p>At his previous clubs, Hull City and Aston Villa, Bruce was in charge when Andrew Robertson, Harry Maguire, Jarrod Bowen and John McGinn were all spotted and signed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/steve-bruce-tips-one-best-17294484">Bruce rates McGinn as his best ever signing </a>and the Newcastle head coach hopes the Magpies can one day unearth a gem like the Scotland international.</p>
      <p>"I hope so. I hope we can go and find one. I think it's a big part. It's going to be the challenge I lay down to Steve and his team," he told ChronicleLive ahead of his return to Villa Park on Monday night.</p>
      <p>"We need to go and find a young British talent. Why not? If they are here, which they are. With McGinn, we nearly didn't get him. We didn't have £2m. Aston Villa not having £2m - you would think it's ludicrous. We couldn't spend a penny. We didn't think we were going to get paid so the owners came in and changed it.</p>
      <p>"£2m? I wouldn't be surprised if he went for £50m or £60m. The one thing it does when you get to a certain age, you look at it and think, 'I'm so pleased for them for one and it gives you that little bit of satisfaction in a tough job to say how well they have done: [Andrew] Robertson, Harry [Maguire], [Sam] Clucas.'</p>
      <p>"It's good to see. I would love to find a few here - of course I would. That's the challenge. Where can you find them?"</p>
      <p>Bruce is on the lookout for a midfielder to improve what he already has at his disposal but the 58-year-old recognises that January is a difficult window to do business in.</p>
      <p>Clubs are particularly keen to keep hold of their best players because there is so little time to find a replacement and the 58-year-old is realistic about the upcoming mid-season window.</p>
      <p>"With the squad of players we've got, we're delighted," he added. "If there's something out there that can improve us, then we'll try and act but, in my experience, nobody wants to sell their best young players in January and it's a difficult, difficult time.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to get everybody's hopes up because I will only bring in players that I think can improve the team. If there is a youngster out there, of course, we're always in a position for that but actually improving the team, it's always difficult."</p>
