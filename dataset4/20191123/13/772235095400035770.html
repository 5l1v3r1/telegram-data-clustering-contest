      <p>Defunct marques are never gone forever as they always seem to be resurrected by the burgeoning Chinese car market.</p>
      <p>While today’s MGs look little like the MG roadsters of yore, the <b>Morris JE</b> dusts off another illustrious British nameplate for a slavishly faithful recreation of an old design.</p>
      <p>There is, however, a modern twist – it’s an electric vehicle.</p>
      <p>The JE is the first product from the resurrected Morris Commercial brand. It’s a dead-ringer for the old Morris J-Type, a forward-control van produced between 1949 and 1961. This isn't, however, a replica like an <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/796670/aston-martin-db4-gt-zagato-review/">Aston Martin Continuation</a> car.</p>
      <p>Much as the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a> Type 2 (Kombi) and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/citroen/">Citroen</a> H Van eventually became fashionable, the Morris J-Type came to enjoy a loyal following. The JE, therefore, employs utterly delightful retro sheetmetal that goes beyond mere homage and into quasi-replica territory. You'll see some obvious differences, however, like modern front bumpers and a charging port located behind the classic pear-shaped grille.</p>

      <p>Morris Commercial fully recognises the JE’s talents as a mobile billboard, saying its distinctive looks “provide eye-catching mobile marketing solutions”. In addition to the van, there are pickup and minibus versions forthcoming and Morris also promises autonomous driving technology down the line.</p>
      <p>Underneath the lightweight, carbon-fibre composite body is a bespoke chassis with a lithium-ion battery powertrain. Morris expects an electric range of <b>321km</b> from the <b>60kWh</b> battery and the JE can be charged to 80 percent in just 30 minutes with a rapid charger. Morris hasn’t released any other specifications.</p>
      <p>Another huge point of differentiation from the old J-Type is the price. Where the J-Type was a workaday van, the JE is more upscale boutique than fish delivery. Prices are expected to start at £60,000 (A$114,206). Blimey, that’s a bit of dosh, innit?</p>

      <p>Of course, for that price the JE isn’t going to have a low-rent delivery van interior. The seats and steering wheel are trimmed in leather with contrast stitching and there’s a modern infotainment system.</p>
      <p>Morris Commercial promises high-quality materials – even in the cargo bay – and an ‘exquisite level of detail’ with ‘luxury materials and quality British craftsmanship’.</p>
      <p>That cargo bay has 5.5 cubic metres of load space and can accommodate items up to 2.4 metres in length, while the van has a total payload of up to 1000kg.</p>

      <p>The reborn Morris Commercial brand was founded by Dr. Qu Li, a Chinese businesswoman formerly affiliated with the defunct <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/mg/">MG Rover</a> and who was responsible for scooping up <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/ldv/">LDV’s</a> assets a decade ago and selling them to <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/category/saic/">SAIC Motor</a>.</p>
      <p>She headquartered the company in Worcestershire but, while the JE was designed and engineered there, it’s not yet known where it’ll be built.</p>
      <p>The Morris nameplate last appeared on a van version of the Austin Metro hatchback in 1985 before that car was rebranded the Austin Metrovan.</p>
      <p>Production of the JE is set to start in 2021 though the Morris JE is unlikely to come here. A word of advice to Morris Commercial: send this to Japan. The land of Mitsuokas and the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/nissan/">Nissan</a> Figaro and S-Cargo would lap this up.</p>
