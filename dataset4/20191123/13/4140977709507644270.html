                      <p>Dele Alli received the ball near the touchline but slipped as he received the ball. Alli however, quickly recovered and brilliantly kept the ball in play by flicking it forward for Son to Run onto. Son then took the ball to the box before delivering a great cross into the far post. Lucas Moura reached there in time to get the ball inside the net.</p>

                            <p>The scoresheet may read Moura’s name but without Alli’s presence of mind there would have been no goal.</p>
                            <p>Jose Mourinho had earlier revealed that he had a one on one with the youngster.</p>
                            <p><i>“I asked him if he was Dele or Dele’s brother,”</i> Mourinho had said.</p>
                            <p>
                              <i>“He told me he was Dele. ‘OK,’ I said. ‘Play like Dele.’”</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>And play like Dele he did.</p>
