      <p>The two-time Wimbledon champion whipped up support for the British team after posting a message on his Instagram account asking for fans in Madrid to get in touch.</p>
      <p>The Lawn Tennis Association were inundated with requests and have given away around 900 tickets.</p>
      <p>Murray's message read: "Is there any Brits over in Madrid right now that want to come watch us in the Davis Cup semi-final tomorrow?</p>
      <p>"We will try and sort as many tickets as possible for anyone who wants to come."</p>
