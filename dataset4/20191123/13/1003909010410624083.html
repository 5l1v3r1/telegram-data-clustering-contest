      <h1>Snow going: Resorts well underway with early season snowfall</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:00:51+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Danny Austin</a></address>
      <p>Let’s be honest, it was a long, not-especially great summer around these parts. Then, before we knew it, winter hit early in Calgary. While that may have been frustrating for anyone looking to extend their golf or camping season, it means the mountains are already covered in deep, beautiful snow.</p>
      <p>Ski and snowboard resorts across Alberta and British Columbia are ramping up for what promises to be a brilliant winter. With a base that was already settled in by Halloween, the months ahead promise to deliver downhill delights at resorts that seem to expand services every year.</p>
      <p>Here’s a look at what’s in store around the region this season:</p>
      <h3>ALBERTA</h3>

      <p>
        <b>CANADA OLYMPIC PARK</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Adult lift ticket: </b>$54.99</p>
      <p><b>Opening Date: </b>Nov. 15 (weather dependent)</p>
      <p>To put it plainly, WinSport is where Calgarians take their first turns on skis or snowboard. That’s one of the legacies of the 1988 Olympic Games, and Canada Olympic Park continues to run programs designed for new skiers and snowboarders — young and old — and to help others improve their skills. There are programs for just about every type of aspiring winter sports enthusiast, and whether you’re learning the basics or trying to take your skill to the next level, Winsport’s got you covered.</p>
      <p><b>Mark it down: </b>WinSport may be a great place for beginners, but it’s also where the world’s best moguls skiers make an annual pilgrimage during a stop on the FIS World Cup. This season, the 2020 Mackenzie FIS Ski Freestlyle Acro World Cup goes from Jan. 31 to Feb. 2 and Canadian athletes will be favourites to bring home gold.</p>

      <p>
        <b>CASTLE MOUNTAIN</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Adult lift ticket: </b>$94.95</p>
      <p><b>Opening Date: </b>Dec. 7</p>
      <p>Castle Mountain can sometimes feel like a secret you only want to share with people who will really appreciate the deep snow and incredible variety of terrain. That’s not necessary, though, because Castle has more than enough awesome skiing and snowboarding to go around. It’s also just two and a half hours from Calgary, so it’s a good day trip destination.</p>
      <p><b>Try something new: </b>Cat skiing can sound like an intimidating proposition, but at Castle, it doesn’t have to be. The resort is one of the few in North America with a resort-based cat skiing operation, and it’s actually lift-assisted, too. For skiers and snowboarders looking to dip their toes into the backcountry, there’s no better way to get started.</p>

      <p>
        <b>NAKISKA</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Adult lift ticket: </b>$94.95</p>
      <p><b>Opening Date: </b>Open weekends now, daily operations begin Nov. 29</p>
      <p>It’s the closest mountain to Calgary, and it’s perfect for a quick day trip where you can eat breakfast at home, ski for a full day and be back in time for dinner. Nakiska’s already been hit with a big helping of early season snow. When you combine that with the Kananaskis resort’s extensive snow-making system, there’s already great coverage across the mountain.</p>
      <p><b>Learner’s paradise: </b>With an expanded magic carpet area, a tubing zone that’s getting bigger and bigger and one of the best ski schools in the country, Nakiska has been responsible for countless Calgarians falling in love with alpine sports. There are single-day, multi-day and multi-week programs available, ensuring it won’t be long before newcomers are tackling Nakiska’s more challenging terrain.</p>

        <figcaption>Skiing and boarding is underway at Mount Norquay, the ski area above Banff.<cite>jpg</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>NORQUAY</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Adult lift ticket: </b>$89</p>
      <p><b>Opening Date: </b>Open now</p>
      <p>Over the years, it would be impossible to count how many skiers and snowboarders have gotten their start at Mount Norquay. The Banff resort’s ski school is as good as it gets, and their racing program is world-renowned. This year, they’ve also added an adult-only Mountain Monday program, which gives participants the flexibility of taking five lessons on whichever Mondays best fit their season.</p>
      <p><b>Looking for a deal: </b>Last year’s Cool2Carpool day was a huge hit, so they’ve brought it back for another go. Norquay runs the promotion once a month, and skiers and riders can all split the price of a lift ticket between those properly buckled into a vehicle.</p>

        <figcaption>Sunshine Village within Banff National Park is famous for its great snow conditions.<cite>DAN EVANS / jpg</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>SUNSHINE VILLAGE</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Adult lift ticket: </b>$127 at window, $117 through mobile</p>
      <p><b>Opening Date: </b>Nov. 8</p>
      <p>Sunshine Village has terrain for absolutely everyone. On one end of the spectrum, there’s Delirium Dive, one of the most hair-raising runs in North America and a challenge for all skiers. Sunshine’s also got loads of terrain for beginners, with about 20 per cent of the resort devoted to runs that are perfect for those new to the sport. Even first-timers will feel like they’re on top of the world.</p>
      <p><b>Use your phone: </b>If you’re heading out to Sunshine Village, here’s a tip: Download the resort’s app and buy your lift ticket using your phone. Not only does it mean you won’t have to wait in line on-hill but, this year, Sunshine is also giving a $10 discount to mobile lift purchases.</p>

        <figcaption>Lake Louise is one of the largest ski resorts in North America.<cite>Shannon Martin / jpg</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>LAKE LOUISE</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Adult lift ticket: </b>$124</p>
      <p><b>Opening Date: </b>Already open</p>
      <p>Every year, they hit the ground running at Lake Louise when they host the only Canadian stops on the Alpine World Cup circuit. This year, the men’s races go Nov. 30 and Dec. 1, with three days of women’s racing kicking off on Dec. 7. The resort’s still got all the world-class runs, incredible restaurants and breathtaking views it’s always had, and this summer they widened Sunset Terrace to make it easier for novice skiers and riders.</p>
      <p><b>Looking for a deal: </b>If you know you’re going to be heading to the mountains a bunch this winter but not enough to justify a season pass, the Lake Louise Plus Card is basically a cheat-code. For $99, you get your first, fourth and seventh visits to the Banff National Park resort for free, as well as 20 per cent off full-day lift tickets on every other visit.</p>

      <p>
        <b>MARMOT BASIN</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Adult lift ticket:</b> $105</p>
      <p><b>Opening Date:</b> Nov. 14</p>
      <p>If you haven’t been up to Jasper’s Marmot Basin in the past two years, you have no idea what’s waiting for you. Marmot’s always had  great variety of terrain, but when it opened the Tres Hombres area two years ago, it gave skiers and snowboarders access to more than 365 vertical metres of steep, difficult terrain. There’s still lots of family-friendly novice skiing, but thrill-seeking, experienced skiers and riders won’t want to miss Tres Hombres.</p>
      <p><b>Packed schedule: </b>There’s not really a bad time to visit Marmot, but scheduling a trip during the Jasper in January festival might be your best bet. The annual festival takes over the whole town and makes it easy to explore Jasper’s arts, culture and culinary options after you get done with your day on the hill.</p>

        <b>KICKING HORSE</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Adult lift ticket: </b>$119.95</p>
      <p><b>Opening Date: </b>Dec. 6</p>
      <p>There’s only a few select resorts in the world capable of hosting an event like the Freeride World Tour. The competition brings in the very best free-skiers in the world and challenges them to carve lines down the steepest, most treacherous terrain. Unsurprisingly, Kicking Horse has become the FWT’s home in Canada, and the Golden, B.C., resort will be hosting the 2020 edition from Feb. 6-12.</p>
      <p><b>Bigger and bigger:</b> Kicking Horse has the sixth biggest vertical in North America and had a massive terrain expansion last year when it added the Ozone Area — previously part of Purcell Heli-Skiing — to its offerings. It’s big, tough terrain, although there’s some intermediate skiing as well. Also, even for non-skiers or snowboarders, a meal at Eagle’s Eye Restaurant is legitimately a can’t-miss occasion.</p>

      <p>
        <b>BIG WHITE</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Adult lift ticket: </b>$129 during peak season, $109 non-peak season</p>
      <p><b>Opening Date: </b>Nov. 28</p>
      <p>You would think that Big White’s name tells you everything you need to know about the resort, right? It’s a massive ski and snowboard area and it gets a whole lot of the fluffy white stuff. As it turns out, there’s a whole lot more to the B.C. resort. There’s an ice climbing tower, dog sled tours, snowshoeing and Nordic skiing. Really, there’s a whole lot more to Big White than the deep powder and huge terrain.</p>
      <p><b>Looking for a deal: </b>If you’re flying into Kelowna for a few days at Big White, the ski resort will reward you for taking a WestJet flight. Show your same-day arrival WestJet boarding pass and you can ski for the rest of the day — and night — for free.</p>

        <b>PANORAMA</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Adult lift ticket: </b>$114</p>
      <p><b>Opening Date: </b>Dec. 6</p>
      <p>They don’t rest on their laurels at Panorama. Every year, it seems like skiers and snowboarders show up at the beginning of the season and there’s a whole new set of experiences added over the summer. This year, the resort continued to expand its Monster Terrain area — a 750-acre zone of inbounds, backcountry-style terrain. It’s accessible by snowcat and is a one-of-a-kind spot.</p>
      <p><b>Never hungry:</b> Panorama takes its food seriously. Not only do they have Canada’s first snowcat food-truck roaming the mountain, they’ve also added a new rustic, Italian-style pizza restaurant called Alto Kitchen &amp; Bar that is sure to keep even the most discerning foodie happy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>REVELSTOKE</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Adult lift ticket: </b>$129</p>
      <p><b>Opening Date: </b>Nov. 30</p>
      <p>You can criss-cross the continent, and there probably isn’t a single other resort that gives you the same powder-guarantee you get at Revelstoke. Every year, the B.C. resort gets pounded with blizzard after blizzard and ends the year with a season total of about 10 metres of snowfall. There are lots of other reasons to visit Revelstoke, but the deep powder stashes are a selling point all on their own.</p>
      <p><b>Looking for a deal: </b>It’s only available to skiers and snowboarders from certain states and provinces and Alberta is lucky enough to be one of them. Revelstoke’s Vertical Card is a preloaded, direct-to-lift loyalty card that unlocks a tonne of savings. The Vertical Card makes getting on the mountain cheaper, to be sure, but also provides discounts on other services and even accommodation on the hill.</p>

        <b>KIMBERLEY</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Adult lift ticket: </b>$94.95</p>
      <p><b>Opening Date: </b>Dec. 14</p>
      <p>Most of us head to ski resorts to hop on a lift and then ski down the mountain. There’s an ever-growing group, however, who prefer to make their way up the slopes without the help of a lift or gondola. Last year, Kimberley started catering to these folks when it opened a new uptracking route that provides a safe area for guests to skin or up-hill ski before ripping back down.</p>
      <p><b>Looking for a deal: </b>As one of the ski areas in the Resorts of the Canadian Rockies group, you get access to Kimberley’s sweet slopes through the RCR Rockies Card. For $114.96, the card lets you ski for free on your first, fourth and seventh visits at either Kimberley, Kicking Horse, Fernie or Nakiska, as well as providing big discounts on your other trips to the mountains.</p>

        <b>FERNIE</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Adult lift ticket: </b>$119.95</p>
      <p><b>Opening Date: </b>Nov. 30</p>
      <p>In the last decade, Fernie has had three or four of its biggest snow years in its history. So yeah, you know you’re probably getting a tonne of powder at the southern B.C. resort. You’re also getting big terrain, with five alpine bowls — and a sizable beginners area, too — and some of the best ski-in, ski-out accommodations you’ll find anywhere.</p>
      <p><b>New to the sport:</b> If you’re just learning the ropes, or whatever the alpine equivalent of ‘ropes’ is, you might not want to spend a full day on the mountain. Luckily, the Town of Fernie is worth the trip from Calgary. The charming downtown is a destination in and of itself. There’s a new distillery on Main Street, some genuinely unique dining options and a tonne of one-of-a-kind retail, as well as two Nordic skiing areas, snowshoeing and much more.</p>
      <figure>

        <b>SILVER STAR MOUNTAIN RESORT</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Adult lift ticket: </b>$106</p>
      <p><b>Opening Date: </b>Nov. 28</p>
      <p>Sure, it’s the alpine runs that made Silver Star famous, but in recent years the resort has dramatically expanded its offerings. For those who prefer to avoid the steepest slopes, Silver Star has a massive 105-km cross-country skiing track, 16 km of snowshoeing trails, fatbiking, tubing and snow bike and snowmobiling tours, too.</p>
      <p><b>Something for everyone:</b> Silver Star is the type of place where skiers and snowboarders tend to return over and over. The POW Pass is perfect for that. You can buy three- or five-day POW passes that offer major savings on the price of getting on the mountain.</p>
