      <p><b>OKU, OKINAWA PREF. – </b>Distinctly Okinawan, Masashi Miyagi is one of those striking characters you have to take a step back from to fully assess.</p>
      <p>First there is the long, ashen hair, tied in a ponytail, with a wispy beard to complete the image of a forest recluse or Confucian elder. Then there is his attire: He never wears any form of top, except in the kitchen, where he dons a simple, utilitarian apron to protect himself from flames and spattering oil.</p>
      <p>During his shoestring travels as a young man, Miyagi explains, he taught himself to cook by watching locals working in the open street kitchens of Southeast Asia and extensive sampling. Now a superb, improvisational cook himself, he confesses to a dislike for hierarchical systems and prescribed techniques. Accordingly, his dinner menus are decided on a whim and by the seasonal availability of ingredients.</p>

      <p>On this trip to Minshuku Miyagi, in the northern Oku region of Okinawa’s main island, I resolve to pay more attention not just to the sybaritic pleasures of eating here, but to the owner’s dinner preparations, which are characteristically singular. Miyagi, who opened the <i>minshuku</i> (guesthouse) 20 years ago, says, “I didn’t open this place to make money, but to be independent.”</p>
      <p>All the food is locally sourced, which accounts for its supreme freshness. Vegetables come from farms and open markets; neighbors exchange produce. Miyagi’s wife helps out on a local coffee farm up in the hills, and often brings home mountain vegetables and herbs. When it comes to seafood, there is only one supplier, Yasu Miyagi, a local fisherman, who also happens to be Miyagi’s nephew.</p>
      <p>This early autumn evening, he prepares a mixed surf-and-turf ensemble. The sashimi, imbricated over a ceramic platter, is <i>aobadai</i> (Westralian jewfish), a local fish, prepared with slices of <i>shīkuwāsā</i> (Okinawan citrus) and wasabi. A second fish, <i>gachun</i> (bigeye scad), is fried with <i>kushinsai</i> (Chinese water spinach). Thai soy sauce, <i>mirin</i> (rice wine), onion, skipjack tuna flakes and olive oil enrich the accompanying sauce.</p>
      <p>On the meat side, Miyagi and a hunter friend recently stalked and captured an Okinawan wild boar, a slightly smaller beast than its mainland counterpart; he doesn’t elaborate on who administered the final coup de grace. Miyagi simmers the initially tough meat for a long time until it’s juicy and tender before frying it in olive oil and garlic, insisting the crispy skin is the tastiest part.</p>
      <p>As I dig into these not insignificant starters, Miyagi works swiftly to simmer a side dish of <i>tebichi</i> (pig’s trotters) in a sauce of miso, soy sauce and pepper alongside chunks of <i>shima dōfu</i> (island tofu), <i>hechima</i> (sponge gourd), a low-calorie vegetable rich in carotenoids and folate, and okra.</p>
      <p>Watching Miyagi’s ministrations in the kitchen — his deft hand, keen eye and sense of how to balance various culinary combinations — the importance of liberally using Okinawan herbs becomes evident. He talks as quickly as he cooks, leaving diners to juggle listening, speaking and, naturally, eating.</p>
      <p>Dishes are laid out alfresco, on a table for guests to help themselves, family-style, and an outside refrigerator is stocked with cans of Orion beer. As I sample my first morsels of a meal that is more country banquet than mere dinner, Miyagi brings out a stoneware jar of <i>awamori</i>, Okinawa’s trademark spirit, made from long-grained Thai rice and black <i>kōji</i> mold spore. For the abstinent, there’s a tank of cooled water, drawn from a spring on the grounds.</p>
      <p>I always sleep well at Minshuku Miyagi. The air up here in Oku is more wholesome, the nocturnal sounds of insects and movement in the tropical undergrowth beyond the window consoling, a natural narcotic.</p>
      <p>But it is also the feast of fresh dishes prepared by an unacknowledged master that speed you to sleep, wondering what culinary marvels will be conjured up the next day.</p>
