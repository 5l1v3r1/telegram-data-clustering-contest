      <h1>'Never Going To Happen' - Former Wigan Chairman On Chris Hughton Links</h1>

      <p>Former Wigan Chairman David Sharpe has dismissed the idea that the Championship club could attract Chris Hughton if they were to get rid of current manager Paul Cook.</p>
      <p>Hughton has been out of a job since the summer when he left Premier League club Brighton. He has been linked to several jobs in the Championship including Cardiff and Stoke City but is reported to be holding out for a Premier League job.</p>
      <p>With Wigan hoovering above the Championship relegation zone, speculation has been mounting over Paul Cook's future for some time now. Speaking last August, he admitted he was at "wits' end" with the situation and would be facing the sack if results did not improve.</p>
      <p>However, speaking to BBC RM Sport, Sharpe said he still supported the manager.</p>
      <blockquote>Who is better than Paul Cook? If fans think Chris Hughton is going to come to Wigan Athletic, that is never going to happen. I am just being realistic from knowing inside what agents ask for, for the manager etc. what it would take.<br/>These top managers are waiting for Premier League clubs. They've all got big pay-offs because they have been sacked at their previous clubs. So the money is not a problem for them, they'll just sit and wait for the perfect job.</blockquote>

      <p>Speaking to the Coaches' Voice, Hughton recently explained why he was content to wait for the right offer.</p>
      <p>"It is interesting. Lots of emotions going on in my head. Once you are not working, after your first or second job you are desperate not to be out of the game for too long.</p>
      <p>"I am probably in a better position now than I would have a few years ago. I want to manage at the highest level. I have managed three Premier League times and thoroughly enjoyed those experiences."</p>
