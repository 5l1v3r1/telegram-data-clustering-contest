      <p>CAIRO - 23 November 2019: President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi congratulated the national team on Friday on clinching the 2019 Africa U-23 Cup of Nations (AFCON). <br/><br/>President Sisi hailed the team's high level of collective performance, high spirit and distinctive management by a national coaching staff. <br/><br/>According to a statement released by presidential spokesperson Bassam Rady; the president also paid tribute to the Egyptian fans for their civilized support for the national team. <br/><br/>Over 75,000 Egyptian fans packed the stadium to support the young Pharaohs against the tournament's underdogs. <br/><br/>Egypt's first goal came minutes before half time thanks to an accurate shot from the team right wing Karim El Iraqi who received a wonderful cross from the man of the match Ramadan Sobhy. <br/><br/>Ivory Coast shocked Egyptian fans who were ready to celebrate the victory as Ndombia scored a dramatic injury-time equaliser to send the game to extra time. <br/><br/>Sobhy proved he is a world class player and scored Egypt's winning goal seven minutes before the final whistle. <br/><br/>Egypt, Ivory Coast and South Africa will be the three representatives of the black continent at the Men's football tournament during Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic Games.</p>
