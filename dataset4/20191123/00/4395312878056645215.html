      <h2>On November 3, 1992, the plan was that Jason would attend school and then I would take him to the Eclectic Café to have dinner. Today was the election of the President of the United States and Jason and I were both big fans of Bill Clinton. But first, as I had promised Joya, I would stop by to see her friend to see what she meant regarding seeing angels. The sky was blue, the weather was clear, I was well rested and feeling good about caring for my son and moving life forward. As the door opened, a woman, (I would guess in her 50’s), with blond hair and very strong blue eyeshadow opened the door. She was very kind and said how happy she was to see me. We walked into a clean and well cared for house. We walked through the house to a room that included two chairs facing forward to look upon a large window with a view of the outside back yard, perfectly groomed. The sweet lady showed me to my chair. We both sat looking outside on the lawn and not toward each other. As she began speaking, saying how happy she was to have this appointment, and as I was looking outside, I began to see an Angel on the lawn. Two parts of my brain began to engage simultaneously. On one side, I was not thrilled. I didn’t want to see anything unusual. I was working, raising my son, newly divorced.... on the other side, my artist mind just began to visually record the information. At one point I had a 100% visual memory. Not now, but at that time, I could look, see and remember noting details that an artist can see. Upon looking outside, I noticed a male angel kneeling toward me. His gown was rose, yellow &amp; blue. His eyes were piercing blue in color and his hair was light. Everything was just like a Renaissance painting until I got to the wings which were white but they were fur, not feathers. This last detail was not what I expected. So, startled, I fell back into my chair. At that point four other Angels were instantly seen all around me. The closest to my right was near my right eye. His skin was darker. His hair was darker. His gown was green and white with red piping. His eyes were dark and his gaze was intense. His wings were similar to the Angel on the lawn. The wings were grey with tufts of forest in the wings. Across to my right was an Angel was was fierce. He had in a bronze breast plate, a sword in his hand, the wings sparked like aluminum foil in darkness. To my left across from me was an Angel with six wings, a red, white and blue gown and a kind demeanor. Behind me to my left was an Angel in a black suit with a silver pin on his lapel. Water was pouring out of my eyes and water was flowing under my armpits. I had my fists up and was ready to defend myself. The air felt like breathing jello and the room now felt warm. By the time this had occurred, I had read all major bibles from every major religions as well as books on Joseph Campbell and books by Einstein. All I could think of was that when I read the Bibles, I took notice that those who saw angels either died or their family was at risk. The energy was powerful yet positive. The woman was still speaking but I was very far away from hearing her voice. I spoke and interrupted her. I said that I had expected that if I ever saw an Angel that he would be so large that his footprint would take the space of the whole City. So, these Angels look much smaller. She was startled. She asked me: “You can see them?” I said that I could. Evidently, she could see much more than I could. Not having wanted to see this in the first place, I felt very protective of my son. To die would have been one thing but I would not leave my son. To care for him was most important. A sixth Angel, the only female moved from my left toward center, making a motion with her hands of calming me down. She repeated, “You are fine. You are fine. Jason is fine. This is not about dying. You made a contract before you were born and it is time now.” Then, they began speaking to me. They said three things: 1. We are Just. Life and death does not mean the same thing to us as it does to you. 2. No Fear. (Which in wry bible is said first.) 3. They wanted something from me. I figured that it had to be the art. I had trained all of my life. Upon realizing that they wanted something, I began to relax. I let them know that that was fine and that I had two immovable conditions: 1. Nothing happen to my son all the days of his life he is protected. 2. This had to be the greatest art that I could ever accomplish or please find someone else. A contract was made. The energy settled. I saw my life pass before my eyes while adjustments were made. The visit lasted two hours. The angels were 7 feet tall by my estimation. The final, seventh angel appeared before me. He was all gold. His wings, face, gown, everything was gold. He was close to me, right in front of me. He knelt also, right leg down, left leg up. He showed me a large wheel to his right and my left. The wheel had 144 spikes and one was lit. I got the distinct impression that whatever we were speaking of was one of the spikes of a wheel to help humanity. So, we were only speaking of one of the 144. He transmitted to me very clearly: “We don’t know if you can do this. But, if you cannot, we can’t guarantee that human beings will continue to survive because of their addiction to violence.” They had told me two other important messages. They wanted 12 Peace Angels throughout Los Angeles and one in Washington, DC. They wanted me to put more emphasis on the peace side so that human beings would continue to exist. After two hours uninterrupted, I left. My life would never be the same. The healer did healing on me for several more sessions. We became out of touch. Several years later I saw her at an event. She came up to me and asked me how we were and what had come of our meeting. She let me know that she had seen many more angels that day and had never in all of her life seen so many Angels come. I told her, it is the Peace Angels Project. She said, “I knew it was something very important.” It is.</h2>
