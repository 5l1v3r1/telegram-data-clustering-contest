        <b>ROUND-UP</b>
      </p>
      <p>- <b>Mauricio Pochettino</b> could be set for a quick return to management. <b>Bayern Munich</b> want to hold talks with the former Tottenham manager, according to The Telegraph.</p>
      <p>- Could the impact of Jose Mourinho be felt at <b>Tottenham</b> already? <b>Toby Alderweireld</b>, who is out of contract at the end of the season, could stay at Spurs after Mourinho's arrival</p>
      <p>- Roma could extend <b>Lorenzo Pellegrini</b>'s contract, but several clubs are interested in the midfielder. <b>Manchester United</b>, <b>Tottenham</b>, <b>Juventus</b>, <b>AC Milan</b> and <b>Inter</b> have shown some interest in Pellegrini, according to CalcioMercato.</p>
      <p>- <b>Marko Pjaca</b> has failed to have an impact since his arrival at Juventus in 2016. CalcioMercato reports the Croatian attacker, who has already been on loan at Schalke and Fiorentina since his arrival in Turin, could be set for another spell away from Juve in January.</p>
      <p>- <b>Chelsea</b> have a target in January if their transfer ban is overturned. The Premier League giants have been monitoring CSKA Moscow striker <b>Fedor Chalov</b>, according to Sky Sports. The 21-year-old scored 15 Russian Premier League goals last season and has five in 16 games in 2019-20.</p>
