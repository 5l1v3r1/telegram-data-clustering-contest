      <p>President <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/22/buhari-speaks-on-seeking-third-term-in-office-as-nigerias-president/"><u><b>Muhammadu Buhari</b> </u></a>on Friday walked out of the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that the NEC meeting was held at the national secretariat of the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/22/details-of-what-apc-discussed-at-its-national-caucus-meeting-emerges/"><u><b>APC</b> </u></a>in Abuja.</p>
      <p>Buhari walked out of the meeting when it became rowdy, the Sun reports.</p>
      <p>The meeting became tensed when anti and pro-Oshiomhole protesters clashed along the road leading to the party’s national secretariat, resulting in security agents firing teargas to disperse the protesters.</p>
      <p>Moves to stop the Edo state chairman of the APC, Anslem Ojezua from gaining access to the meeting proved abortive as other state chairmen threatened to walk out of the meeting.</p>
      <p>The tension caused by the disagreement reportedly made the meeting uncomfortable for President Buhari.</p>
      <p>It was also gathered that the National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole was giving a vote of confidence by some members of the APC, thereby escaping impeachment.</p>
      <p>However, no decision was taken on the suspended members of the party like the immediate past governors of Imo and Ogun states, Rochas Okorocha and Ibikunle Amosun among others who were incidentally absent at the meeting.</p>
      <p>During the meeting, it was revealed that the shortfall in the funds generated to finance the 2019 presidential election almost denied President Buhari re-election.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the NEC meeting, Oshiomhole said they had to frantically source for funds a few days to the election to prosecute the poll.</p>
