        <b>Google's updated Android Security Rewards Program now offers up to six-figure rewards for reporting potential severe exploits that affect its Titan M security module. It applies to such discrepancies that can affect the Pixel 4, 3 and 3a smarphone series. Other similar bounties include up to US$250000 for Secure Element or Trusted Execution Environment hacks.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Google has <a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/android-rewards/">updated</a> its Android Security Rewards Program so as to integrate the new Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL devices, and to refresh the bounties that are offered for executable vulnerabilities that affect the Titan M security chip found in these phones, as well as in the Pixel 3, 3 XL, 3a and 3a XL. smarphone series.</p>
      <p>The Mountain View giant's mobile-OS <a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/android-rewards/">Security Rewards Program</a>'s next highest bounty is for up to half a million US dollars, potentially payable to anyone who can bypass existing safeguards to extract high-value data in the presence of the Titan M platform. It offers up to $250000 for the same secured by a Google Secure Element.Â </p>
      <p>Reports of code-executions that affect such an Element are also potentially valued at the same amount, as are those that target Trusted Execution Environments in Android. In addition, there is also <a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/android-rewards/">up to $100000</a> for the ability to identify new methods of impugning a phone's lockscreen.</p>
      <p>Those aiming to claim such rewards would be <a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/android-rewards/">best served</a> by writing them up in full, as well as the ability to define and characterize them properly. This includes criteria such as whether the vulnerability in question is device-agnostic or not; whether the attack vector has been nominated correctly; the exploit's reproducibility and what must be done to take advantage of it.</p>
