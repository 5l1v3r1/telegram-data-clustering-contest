        <b>The Black Meteors have failed to qualify for the Olympics Games in Tokyo next year after a penalty shoot out defeat to South Africa at the CAF U-23 Cup of Nations. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Emmanuel Cudjoe's missed penalty handed the South Africans the ticket to Tokyo after Kingsley Fobi and Edward Sarpong had missed earlier spot kicks.</p>
      <p>Ghana twice came from behind to level the scores in regulation time, after Evans Mensah and Samuel Obeng had leveled goals from Habib Mohammed (own goal) and Kamohelo Abel.</p>
      <p>Habib forced an own goal after misdirecting a Luther Signh cross into his own net before Evans Mensah's sumptions strike leveled the scores on 50 minutes.</p>
      <p>The Black Meteors again fell back second half substitute Kamohelo Abel's goal before Samuel Obeng made the best from the wizardry skills of Evans Mensah on the right.</p>
      <p>The game headed straight in to penalty shootouts, and Ghana missed three spot kicks with the South Africans missing two after seven kicks.</p>
