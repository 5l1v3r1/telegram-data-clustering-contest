      <h1>LeBron James: Anthony Davis Needs to ‘Take More Threes’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slamonline.com/author/mutoni/" target="_blank">Marcel Mutoni</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/lebron-james">LeBron James</a>, along with the Lakers’ coaching staff, is pleading with teammate <a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/anthony-davis">Anthony Davis</a> to hoist up more three-point shot attempts.</p>
      <p>Davis is “too damn good of a shooter” not to put ’em up, according to James.</p>

      <p>AD went 4-for-7 from beyond the arc en route to a game-high 33 points Friday night, leading visiting Los Angeles past the OKC Thunder 130-127.</p>
      <p>Per <i><a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2019-11-23/lakers-anthony-davis-to-keep-shooting-from-three">The LA Times</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“I already knew,” Davis said. “The ones that I miss I’m either falling back or hesitant on a shot because I want to make the right play. I probably drive or find another player for a shot or I’m not getting my feet set or whatever. Now I’m always shot ready knowing that if it comes to me, I’m going to shoot it.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>In his first three NBA seasons he attempted only 27 threes. That number jumped to 108 the next season and 162 in the 2017-18 season, which was a career high. He’s on pace to shatter that mark this season. Davis has already attempted 44 threes and made 34.1% of them.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“We want him to take more threes,” LeBron James said.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“Teams are playing off of him and he’s too damn good of a shooter not to shoot them. And he’s been doing that the last couple games.”</i>
