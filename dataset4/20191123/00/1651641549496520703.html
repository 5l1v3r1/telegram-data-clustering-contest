      <p>Facebook may be porting over one of Instagram’s most loved features, Close Friends. Close Friends was a built-in privacy feature that let you choose to share story content to only a select group of followers, your close friends. “Sometimes what you want to share isn’t for everyone. With Close Friends, you have the flexibility to share more personal moments with a smaller group that you choose,” The <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/instagram-will-soon-let-you-share-content-to-close-friends-each-separately/">Instagram team said a year ago.</a></p>

Micro sharing, it seems, is a feature that Facebook has found successful. The growth of smaller privacy-focused app like Snapchat has proven to be a goldmine of ideas for the larger firm. Whether it brings this concept over to its main app seems to a matter of when, rather than if.</p>
