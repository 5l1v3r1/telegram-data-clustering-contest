      <p>SAITAMA, Japan (AP) - Urawa Reds head into Sunday’s second leg of the Asian <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/champions-league/">Champions League</a> final against Saudi Arabia’s Al Hilal aiming to become the first three-time winners of the continental championship.</p>
      <p>A second-half goal from Andre Carrillo Diaz gave Al Hilal a 1-0 win over Urawa in the first leg in Riyadh on Nov. 10.</p>
      <p>“Al Hilal may have dominated but the match ended 1-0,” said Urawa coach Tsuyoshi Otsuki. “We played that game with an aim and I think we finished it with a result that gives us a realistic chance to fight in Saitama.”</p>
      <p>Urawa, which also won the competition in 2007, will be hoping for a repeat of the 2017 final when they beat Al Hilal 1-0 to be crowned champions after a 2-1 aggregate win.</p>
      <p>In addition to the Asian <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/champions-league/">Champions League</a> final, Urawa has other concerns.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>Urawa is near the J-League’s drop zone with just two games to play and, should results go against them on Saturday, the Japanese side could go into the second leg looking over their shoulders.</p>
      <p>Urawa currently occupies 13th place in the J-League and are six points above Matsumoto Yamaga in 17th, one of two automatic relegation positions. They are five ahead of Shonan Bellmare in 16th, a position that requires an end-of-season relegation play-off.</p>
      <p>Al Hilal, meanwhile, is seeking its first title.</p>
      <p>“We are in a good position at the moment, but we must concentrate in the second leg in Japan,” said 28-year-old forward Salem Al Dawsari. “We will not be fooled with the level of Urawa in the first match as they are a strong team and we must double our efforts in the second leg.”</p>

        <p>But unlike two years ago, the Riyadh club has the lead to defend and start the final with the knowledge that Urawa has to score.</p>
        <p>In their two previous Asian <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/champions-league/">Champions League</a> finals, Urawa did not concede a goal in the home second legs and have wound up lifting the continental title in front of their own supporters.</p>
        <p>With goalkeeper Shusaku Nishikawa back in the starting lineup after serving a one-match ban, Otsuki’s team will be looking for more home-field success in front of what is expected to be a sold-out Saitama Stadium.</p>
