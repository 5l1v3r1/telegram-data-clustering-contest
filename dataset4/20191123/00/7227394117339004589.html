      <h1>One percent of the app publishers account for 80% of the total downloads in Q3 2019</h1>

      <p>According to extensive research done by Sensor Tower, about 1% of the top app publishers across Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store generated 80% of the total app downloads in Q3 2019 leaving the rest of the market fighting for the remaining 20%.</p>
      <p>The 80% translate into 29.6 billion downloads and the available apps in Google Play and App Store were 3.4 million in 2018, which is a staggering 65% increase from 2014. Unfortunately, though, only 26% of the apps had at least 1,000 downloads in 2018 - a significant decline from the 30% in 2014. This means that more apps get lost in the app stores over time.</p>

      <p>The sum of all publishers from both app stores is approximately 792,000 and just 7,920 of those generated the unique 23.6 billion installs. Facebook, of course, falls into that 1% and its app alone saw 682 million new installs during Q3 2019.</p>
      <p>The same goes for mobile game publishers - the top 1% of them got 9.1 billion downloads, which in turn is 82% of the total game downloads leaving the rest 2 billion downloads to the remaining publishers.</p>

      <p>And as far as revenue is concerned, the gap is even bigger. Out of the $22 billion gross revenue in Q3, the top 1% got a fat cut of $20.5 billion. Just 7% of the total revenue is distributed over the remaining 151,056 publishers representing the 99%.</p>
