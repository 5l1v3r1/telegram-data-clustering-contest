      <p>Wilder is one of the most dynamic and fan-friendly fighters in the world. Even though his style sometimes lacks polish, you cannot argue with his results. He has floored every opponent he’s faced in 45 professional fights, and no one has ever officially beaten him (44-0-1, 43 KOs).</p>
      <p>There is no fighter in the world whose presence makes a more sincere promise of action. That said, Ortiz is a legitimate threat to dethrone Wilder, which was evidenced by his near stoppage win in the seventh round of their first fight. That first meeting was one of the best fights of 2018. Fans can only hope they are treated to another war.</p>
      <p>Most will be watching to see if Ortiz can recreate the magic and finish the job, or perhaps Wilder will make even quicker work of the aging Cuban than he did in 2018 when he rallied to score a 10th-round KO win.</p>
      <p>A major rematch with Tyson Fury hangs is likely on the line for Wilder, so there is plenty of reason for fans to be interested in the result.</p>

        <b>The Undercard</b>

      <p>If you can appreciate boxing below the heavyweight division, you’ll love the Wilder-Ortiz 2 undercard. One other world title and two secondary titles will be on the line. Here is a look at the top portion of the undercard.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>(c) Leo Santa Cruz vs. Miguel Flores - WBA Super World Super Featherweight Title</li>
        <li>Brandon Figueroa vs. Julio Ceja - WBA (regular) Super Bantamweight Title</li>
        <li>Luis Nery vs. Emmanuel Rodriguez - WBC Silver Bantamweight Title</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The premier undercard match is Santa Cruz vs. Flores. A win could launch Santa Cruz into a long-awaited showdown with Gary Russell Jr. or a host of other potentially epic matchups. PBC and FOX would love for Figueroa to grow into a major star, and Nery has been considered elite for the past few years.</p>
      <p>However, with Naoya Inoue signing with Top Rank and ESPN, the chances of Nery climbing in with a potential game-changing rival has seemingly dwindled.</p>
      <p>Still, it should be great to see one of the best punchers in the lower weight classes take on an undefeated foe like Rodriguez.</p>
