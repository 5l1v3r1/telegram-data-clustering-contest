      <p>CAIRO – 23 November 2019: The launch of two telecommunications satellites in TIBA-1 and Inmarsat GX5 on an Ariane 5 rocket was scrubbed with less than 20 minutes to launch for technical issues. Another attempt will take place on Saturday. <br/><br/>This mission (officially known as Ariane Flight VA250) will be the fourth Ariane 5 launch of the year, and the eighth launch for Arianespace as a whole in 2019, according to Nasa Space Flight. <br/><br/>"Arianespace has decided to stop the final operation for two days,” Stephane Israel, chief executive officer of Arianespace said in a statement late on Friday. “The spacecrafts are in safe mode and we are now targeting a new launch window tomorrow and we will keep you posted for sure,” he added.</p>

      <p>The two satellites that will launch on Friday’s mission – TIBA-1 and Inmarsat 5 F5 (also known as GX5) – both function as mobile telecommunications relay platforms that will be operated on behalf of the government of Egypt and Inmarsat, respectively.</p>

      <p>TIBA-1 – which is based on the Eurostar 3000 satellite platform and was developed by Thales Alenia Space &amp; Airbus Defence and Space – occupies the larger upper portion of the Ariane 5 payload fairing, and will be released first during the launch. <br/><br/>TIBA-1 was designed with a lifetime of over 15 years on orbit. The satellite will be the 4th such spacecraft launched by Arianespace for Egypt, the 127<sup>th</sup> Airbus satellite launched by Arianespace, and the 160th launch by the company for Thales Alenia Space, Nasa added.</p>
