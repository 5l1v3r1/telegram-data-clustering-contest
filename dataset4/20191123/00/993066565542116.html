      <p>The US star, who got the boot with professional partner Giovanni Pernice from Strictly Come Dancing last weekend, said she was “super excited” to host her own show.</p>
      <p>“I’m hoping there will be a song for everyone to dance to, not to mention music from some of the biggest divas in the business… think Madonna, Lady Gaga, Chaka Khan and Aretha Franklin,” she said.</p>
