      <p>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Devin Booker had 35 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists, and the Phoenix Suns beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 100-98 on Saturday in a matchup of short-handed teams.</p>
      <p>Kelly Oubre Jr. added 25 points and 10 rebounds for the Suns, who had lost three in a row.</p>
      <p>Phoenix was clinging to a 98-95 lead when Minnesota star Karl-Anthony Towns missed a 3-pointer with 9.2 seconds left from just inside the half-court line. Booker went to the line and iced the game with a pair of free throws.</p>
      <p>Phoenix shot a season-low 34.4% from the field but tied a season low with seven turnovers. It also made 24 of 26 foul shots, outscoring Minnesota by 14 from the line.</p>
      <p>Playing without starting point guard Ricky Rubio and center Aron Baynes, the Suns led by as many as 12 before the Timberwolves rallied.</p>

      <p>Booker just missed his first career triple-double but he answered every Minnesota challenge.</p>
      <p>Booker’s 17 points in the third quarter helped Phoenix regain control after Minnesota tied the game. Towns hit a pair of 3s and had nine points as the Wolves went on a 15-4 run. With the game tied 65-all, the Suns finished the third on a 17-8 run as Booker scored six and Oubre had five during the stretch.</p>
      <p>When the Wolves closed within two in the final minutes, Booker hit a teardrop jump shot in the lane over Towns. Wiggins answered but Booker was there on the other end for a pair of free throws.</p>
