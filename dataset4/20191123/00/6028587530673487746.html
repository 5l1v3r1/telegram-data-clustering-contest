      <p>Google’s  internet air-balloon service Loon, is moving beyond Africa and into the Amazon rainforest. The company announced it’s bringing internet to areas of Peru where <a href="https://qz.com/1753002/loon-signs-deal-to-expand-internet-in-rural-peru-with-balloons/">around 200,000 people live</a>, thanks to its agreement with Internet Para Todos Perú (IpT) an open-access infrastructure operator. Connecting remote parts of Africa and the Amazon could mean big business for the search giant.</p>
      <p><b>The Breakdown You Need to Know: </b><a href="https://www.culturebanx.com/">CultureBanx</a> noted that<b> </b>every new person they are able to connect to the internet has the possibility to turn into a paying customer. Currently, a quarter of people in the Amazon Rainforest lack 3G internet access, and IpT wants to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614744/google-is-going-to-deploy-loon-balloons-in-rural-peru/">connect 6 million rural Peruvians</a> by 2021, which is why this deal makes sense. However, this isn’t Loon’s first trip to the region, while still under Alphabet’s X department, the research lab of the company once called “Project Loon” was deployed twice after natural disasters to affected areas. The first live field test came in May 2017, after devastating floods in Lima, Peru. Loon was able to provide post disaster cell service to an estimated 25,000 square miles, according to the BBC. The balloons were subsequently also deployed in November 2017, after Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico and helped return service to nearly 250,000 residents.</p>
      <p><b>Flying High: </b>Over in Africa, Loon’s first task was to use the internet-connectable high-altitude balloons to provide coverage to rural Kenya. With a population of over 45 million people, Kenya is the seventh-largest country in Africa and its eighth-largest economy. Though its metropolitan centers are well connected, there are still plenty of rural and suburban areas that remain without internet connectivity.</p>
      <p>The Alphabet subsidiary <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/02/alphabet-loon-balloon-kenya-internet-service-testing/?_guc_consent_skip=1574336579">teamed up with Kenya’s Telkom</a> company to bridge an internet-connectivity gap in rural and suburban Kenya. Its balloons launched from the central mountains in Kenya this summer, with the goal of  providing commercial mobile internet at some point this year. As for now, the two companies are awaiting final regulatory approval before it can begin service.</p>
      <p>How exactly does Loon work? The balloons are similar in practice to traditional weather balloons, floating at 60,000 feet above sea level, and can cover areas within a 25-mile radius. They offer fourth-generation (4G) wireless connectability and are steered by artificial intelligence. All of Loon’s deals require a telecom partner, allowing them to provide the same service consumers would get from typical masts, according to BBC.</p>
      <p><b>What’s Next:</b> Loon plans to deploy its balloons in Peru to provide 4G/LTE service beginning in 2020. In order for them to take flight in the Amazon, the company must first secure regulatory approval from Peru's Ministry of Transport and Communications.</p>
