      <p>In Friday box office news that isn’t about <i>Frozen II</i>, Sony’s <i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood </i>earned $4.545 million on its first day, including $900,000 in Thursday previews. That positions Marielle Heller’s terrific drama, starring Tom Hanks as Mister Rogers, for a $14 million opening weekend. That’s on the low end of expectations, but the hope is that the $25 million drama will leg out over the next month. It’s a terrific movie and absolutely should be in the awards season conversation. And if it clicks, relatively speaking, then it could end up with around $50-$55 million domestic. The only caveat is that it’s closer in spirit to <i>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty </i>and <i>Saving Mr. Banks</i>, seemingly kid-targeted films that are very much for adults, as opposed to <i>Wonder </i>or <i>The Blind Side</i>.</p>
      <p>STX Entertainment’s <i>21 Bridges </i>opened yesterday with $3.33 million on Friday, including $700,000 in Thursday previews. That positions the $33 million, R-rated Chadwick Boseman action flick for a $10 million opening weekend. That’s a not great start for the decent, well-made cop thriller (it earned a B+ from Cinemascre), but this as a co-production between STX, MWM Studios and Huayi Brothers.</p>
      <p>Yes, I will again note that these kind of non-franchise star vehicles were supposed to be part of the proverbial “end game” for the push for diversity/inclusivity, where Chadwick Boseman could have the kind of star vehicles that Ryan Reynolds took for granted. And yet, we remain more excited about Naomi Harris playing Moneypenny or a baddie in <i>Venom 2 </i>than starring in the original, topical, and very good actioner <i>Black &amp; Blue</i>.</p>
      <p>In platform debuts, Focus Features’ <i>Dark Waters </i>opened with $33,000 on Friday in four theaters. That sets Todd Haynes’ well-reviewed (and, yes, I watched it last night and it’s quite good) Mark Ruffalo/Anne Hathaway/Tim Robbins legal drama up for a $110,000 weekend. That’s an okay $27,460 per-theater average, and frankly I’d be pleasantly surprised if this grim and mournful true-life tale of corporate corruption broke out in this “escapism only” era.</p>
      <p>Adults have <i>Ford v Ferrari </i>and (starting next week) <i>Knives Out</i> for high quality grown up movies that are “fun” as well as “good.” It will be interesting to see how the “good but grim” likes of <i>Honey Boy </i>($951,000 after 17 days), <i>Waves </i>($375,000 after ten days) and <i>Queen and Slim </i>(opening next week and, yes, it’s excellent) perform alongside the conventionally escapist fare.</p>
