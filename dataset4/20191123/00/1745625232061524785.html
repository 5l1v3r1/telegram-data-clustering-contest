      <p>Alyssa Milano revealed that her new Farrelly Brothers series features an impressive cast.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/alyssa-milano/">Alyssa Milano</a> has just given her fans a sneak peek at the character she’ll be playing in a new comedy series. On Friday, the<i> Insatiable</i> star took to Instagram to share a photo of one of the revealing outfits that she’ll be wearing, as well as her wild hairstyle.</p>
      <p>In the snapshot, the 46-year-old <i>Project Runway All Stars</i> host is rocking a lacy purple push-up bra and a pair of black low-rise jeans. The daring ensemble shows off her flat stomach, voluptuous cleavage, and slender hips. Alyssa’s long, wavy hair has been dyed the same shade of violet as her lingerie top, and she’s wearing it with an extreme side part. Her short fingernails have also been painted purple.</p>
      <p>Alyssa’s edgy, rocker-chic look includes multiple accessories. She has a small fake septum ring in her nose, and there are two long silver chain necklaces around her neck. One of them has a chunky ring dangling from it, while the other features a badge-shaped pendant embellished with a star.</p>
      <p>Alyssa completed her daring new look with multiple rings on her fingers and a black cuff bracelet on one wrist. Her lips were pale pink while her eye makeup was dark and dramatic. She snapped her photo in front of a mirror using a phone attached to a silver case trimmed with silver studs.</p>
