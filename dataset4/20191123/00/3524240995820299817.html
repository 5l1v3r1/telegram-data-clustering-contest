      <p>Precious Agaezichi was born with phocomelia (thalidomide syndrome), a rare birth defect that can affect the upper and/or lower limbs which could be caused as a side effect of the drug – thalidomide (marketed as a mild sleeping pill) – taken during early pregnancy. The 20-year-old student and aspiring model from the Udi Local Government Area of Enugu State, tells ALEXANDER OKERE how she motivates herself to carry on</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>You don’t have a fully-developed left limb. How did it happen?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I was born with it. My mum took a drug called Thalidomide when she was pregnant. The drug was taken to reduce morning sickness. She didn’t know it had a side effect. So, most of the women who took that drug had kids that were born with malformed limbs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>As a child, when did you realise your left hand was malformed?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I noticed it at the age of five. I thought I wouldn’t have friends. But I quickly adapted to the knowledge that I couldn’t do well with my left hand what my right hand could do.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>How did that affect your interaction with other children?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I felt different from other kids. As a kid, I had to beg people to talk to me. I was actually a loner. I was rejected by my classmates (in primary school) and other children I met in my neighbourhood. Those experiences made me feel very bad as a child. But now, they don’t.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>As a teenager, were there also challenges with getting people to accept you as you were?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I found it difficult talking to people other than those close to me. I couldn’t socialise and was always indoors.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Did your condition affect your relationship with boys?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I don’t think it did. But it’s personal. I have few friends; I can count them.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>What forms of discrimination have you faced as a result of your condition?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>As a child, I was mocked. My peers in primary school stared a lot at my hand. At nursery school, I had to part with my lunch or hair ribbon before my classmates would agree to talk to me. When I taught we had become friends, at a time, I was pushed into a pit, with stones thrown at me and sand poured on my head.</p>
      <p>In secondary school, I was bullied and maltreated. My dad had to change the nursery and primary schools I attended when the maltreatment was too much and I complained to him. I attended Chiazor Nursery and Primary School; Maranatha Nursery and Primary School; Kingdom Heritage Nursery and Primary School; and Marvellous Grace International School, all in Enugu. I also attended Queen’s Secondary School, Enugu; Landmark University, Kwara State, before I transferred to Godfrey Okoye University, Enugu.</p>
      <p>At Queen’s School, I was also maltreated. I remember when I resumed as new pupil, a girl kept touching the affected hand and I hate it when people do that. I told her to stop but she refused.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Having faced those challenges as a child, how do you manage similar ones as an adult?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I learnt to build my self-esteem. That was the first thing I did. I have realised that when people mock me and it gets to me, it is because I don’t have a high self-esteem. I really don’t care about what people think about me now. That’s how I overcome discrimination. Obviously, I look beyond rejection and discrimination to achieve what I set out to achieve.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>What was your aspiration as a teenager?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>As a teenager, I wanted to be a banker but my mum said I liked money too much so I couldn’t be a banker. She wanted me to be a lawyer. However, I later realised that I didn’t like mathematics, so I had to drop the idea of going into banking. She later advised me to study International Relations. I was studying Political Science at Landmark (University) before I left for Godfrey Okoye University, where I am studying History, International Studies and Diplomacy. But I would like to be an air hostess. I would like to have a home for persons living with disablities. I would also like to have my own clothing line.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>How do you cope with activities you ordinarily have to do with two hands?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>We all have challenges but all that matters is how we face them. My mum taught me and I taught myself how to cope with them. So, I do 99 per cent of what I do myself.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>What are some of the basic things you do by yourself?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I wash my clothes. I wash plates and do anything a normal person does.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>How have your siblings been supportive?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>They have been very supportive. They are very real with me. I used to think my brother hated me but I later realised that what he did was to help me learn how to cope.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>When did your interest in modelling start?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>As a child, I always dreamt about seeing myself on the cover of magazines. But it got to a point in primary school when someone told me that if my arms were complete, I would be very beautiful and could become a model. That really hurt me but I had to move on. But when I got to secondary school, people started complimenting me on my skin and looks. So, I started considering it (modelling). At university, I got calls for photo shoots. So basically, I went into modelling because of my skin and the structure of my body. I have modelled for clothing lines and makeup studios.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Are you involved in any form of advocacy of other people with a similar condition?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I do that when they come on my (social media) page. Some people there ask me how I cope mentally.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>What are your thoughts about the welfare of persons living with disabilities in Nigeria?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>In Nigeria, people look down on persons living with disabilities. I think such individuals (PLWDs) should not be referred to as disabled because a person with all their body parts complete could be disabled mentally. Some people who are physically challenged are more reasonable than some who claim to be complete.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>When someone wants to start a conversation with you, what do you want that person to know?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>First, I hate meeting people and if I do, I may not know how to keep up with you. So, if someone wants to talk to me, I hate attracting sympathy. I hate it when people say ‘sorry’ to me. I want them to see how strong I am. I want them to see a bold person in me. I want them to feel encouraged when they see me – a bold, strong and young girl.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>What motivates you?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I think about me and people – I motivate myself.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Were there times you thought about the condition and felt sad?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes. Sometimes, I think about myself and ask, “Why me?” Sometimes, I ask myself whether I would ever get married or whether my kids would ever be proud of me.  But those are stupid thoughts. I once contemplated suicide because I broke down in frustration. I just wanted to know what it felt like having two hands, even if it was for one second. I really felt depressed that I looked different from every other person. But I thank God that I thought about what would happen if I killed myself. So, I moved on.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>What lessons has being born with phocomelia taught you?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>It has taught me to be strong, bold and confident and never to give up.</p>
