      <p>You want comfortable, stylish menswear, but you also don’t want to contribute to the ever-growing Great Pacific Garbage Patch. We hear you. Thankfully, many brands are now repurposing plastic waste in order to create stylish jackets, hoodies, t-shirts joggers, and more. Below, find our recommendations for the best way to stay fly while also helping to confront our <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/spensermestel/2019/11/18/the-seven-plastic-waste-reducing-products-you-need-in-your-home/">single-use plastic epidemic</a>. <a href="https://www.mammut.com/us/en/p/1013-01080-00332/whitehorn-in-jacket-men/">Mammut’s Whitehorn Insulated Jacket</a></p>

      <p>This warm, reversible jacket is a celebration of recycled materials: yarn, down, Pertex Quantum, and Ajungilak filling. It’s also ultra-soft, lightweight, and wind- and water-repellent, so if you’re considering a winter hiking trip (or just need to get from your house to the grocery store without freezing), consider the Whitehorn.</p>

      <p>If you’re looking for a warm, lightweight hoodie, this jacket is both breathable and insulated with Pinneco Core™, which is made from 50% recycled plastic. On the back, it’s reinforced with Pinneco Mantle™, which is 100% recycled plastic, and the company behind these materials, Pinneco, is also a signatory on the United Nation’s pledge to reduce textile industry carbon emissions by 30% by 2030.</p>

      <p>A certified <a href="https://www.cotopaxi.com/pages/b-corp-certified">B Corporation</a>, Cotopaxi created this fleece using 100% repurposed polyester leftover from other apparel companies’ manufacturing process. The result is a super-fresh, ultra-cozy fleece that can act as a jacket or a midlayer. Also, it comes in a variety of retro colorways that are all limited edition.</p>

      <p>Made from organic cotton and recycled polyester, this hoodie is a great piece from a company committed to ethical practices. Besides <a href="https://www.tentree.com/pages/ethical-manufacturing">listing every factory</a> used to manufacture its products (along with whether they’ve been visited by tentree), the brand plants ten trees for each item purchased.</p>

      <p>Every Recover Brand polo started as a plastic bottle that was then shredded, blended with upcycled cotton, spun into yarn, and knitted into fabric, meaning it’s constructed from 100% recycled materials. Lightweight, comfortable, and with a relaxed collar, it’s the choice for an all-night music festival or a round of 18 at the country club.</p>

      <p>Like Recover Brands, Headsweats also relies on the <a href="https://repreve.com/">REPREVE</a> fabric that converts plastic into fabric. In this case, four plastic bottles became a moisture-wicking, water-repelling, tag-less, breathable performance tee that’s perfect for any situation that might get sweaty.</p>

      <p>It’s hard to wear these joggers and not feel like you’re living in the future. Yes, they’re made from Merino Wool and recycled plastic, but they’re also manufactured using what is essentially a 3-D printer for clothes. Instead of creating the fabric and then cutting the design, they’re knit to completion, meaning no seams rubbing against your skin and no waste produced during the process.</p>

      <p>Another member of the REPREVE family, DeFeet’s Levitator Lite socks are the lightest that the company makes and constructed with mesh for maximum breathability. To prevent any unseemly holes, they also have both a reinforced heel and toe, and at six inches, they’ll cover your leg without suffocating your calf.</p>
