      <p>I rarely use my editorial letter for housekeeping purposes. I feel it is better used to reflect my experiences and musings on industry trends and issues. However, there are so many things that we need to alert you about before the end of the year that I feel compelled to pass along some information.</p>
      <p>First is the innaugural Infrastructure Virtual Summit, which we hosted online in coordination with two other brands—Roads &amp; Bridges and Storm Water Solutions—published by our parent company Scranton Gillette Communications. This event included online webinars covering water and wastewater projects, roads construction, electrical safety, storm water management and erosion control over the course of three days. </p>
      <p>While this online event has passed, there is still time to check out the webinars as they are available on-demand at <a href="http://www.roads-water-summit.com/">www.roads-water-summit.com</a> to view at your leisure. I encourage you to check out the offerings as we were quite proud of the lineup!</p>
      <p>Also, as we move into 2020, we will begin our nomination period for WWD Young Pros. Each year, we pick 10 young professionals nominated through our online form (<a href="http://www.bit.ly/wwdyoungprosnomination">www.bit.ly/wwdyoungprosnomination</a>) to highlight up-and-coming talent in the water and wastewater industry. We see this as a crucial part in our role to ensure the future of the industry is rife with talent and bright minds. So if you have an individual you feel deserves recognition, visit our website to nominate them today!</p>
      <p>And lastly, you’ll notice that our 2019 WWD Top Projects and Industry Icon awards were presented during a ceremony at WEFTEC 19. You can catch a glimpse of that on page 12 and on our website in videos, photos and project snippets. As always, the full write-ups will be printed in the December issue of WWD, when we also will publish the 2019 State of the Industry Report. </p>
      <p>That said, nominations for 2020 WWD and iWWD Top Projects and the 2020 WWD Industry Icon are open right now. You can find the links to nomination forms on page 13, so make it a point to get your project recognized next year!</p>
      <p>And if you have any questions or concerns, my inbox is open at the email below.</p>
