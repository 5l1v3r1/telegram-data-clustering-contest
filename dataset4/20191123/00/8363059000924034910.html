      <h1>All the Best Deals in Lego's Pre-Black Friday 'VIP Weekend' Sale</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:15:19+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 00:15</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Pritchard</a></address>
      <p>Today is the day many of us here at Giz towers have been looking forward to every since it was announced. Today is the start of Lego's <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/vip?icmp=SW-SHB-F-VIP-vipwee-1285">'VIP Weekend'</a>, which kicks off as the company's pre-Black Friday sale for all the people who signed up to the VIP reward scheme.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/lego-black-friday-sales-2019/">The company promised</a> discounts of 30% on selected sets, and we went trawling through them to see exactly which ones were worth having. But first, let's remind everyone about the extra bonuses.</p>
      <p>The main bonus is that all VIPs get double points on every single purchase they make. It works out at around three points per pound spent normally, and so six points per pound now. Obviously the more you spend the more you'll gain.</p>
      <p>On top of this anyone spending over £120 will receive the exclusive Christmas gift for this year, which is a Christmas tree. Spend over £200 and you'll wind up with an embiggened 2x4 red Lego brick and a stand.</p>

      <p>Ok not a fantastic selection, but that's not all there is. VIP Weekend ends at at midnight on Sunday, paving the way for the Black Friday sale to kick off as Monday as soon as begins. That means discounts available to all the people who don't have VIP memberships. We'll trawl through those deals too, so make sure to take a look.</p>
