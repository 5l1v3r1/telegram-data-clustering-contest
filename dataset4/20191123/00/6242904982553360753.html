        <b>Ghana International Kevin-Prince Boateng has advocated for the deduction of points of clubs whose supporters are involved with racist chants.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former AC Milan star plans to set up an anti-racist organization to fight racism which he believes the authorities have not done enough to tackle the situation.</p>
      <p>In recent times there have been racist chants towards players such as  Balotelli, Koulibaly, Kean in the Serie A.</p>
      <p>Boateng believes people caught in racist chants should be locked up as well as clubs should be punished with a point deduction.</p>
      <p>"I'm sick of it," said the 32-year-old, "people do not understand how Balotelli, Boateng or Koulibaly feel when they get home."</p>
      <p>He becomes "crazy" when he hears comments like "'yes and you deserve five million euros."</p>
      <p>“These are scars that you cannot get rid of, ", he said.</p>
      <p>It was not enough parts to exclude the fans, "we have to lock them in. The clubs have to pay for the behavior of their fans".</p>
      <p>“If necessary, they should be punished with a point deduction”, he added.</p>
