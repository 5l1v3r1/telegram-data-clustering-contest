        <b>Zidane has a wide range of options for almost all positions, but there is one where there are not so many. The CDM position is played by Casemiro and Fede Valverde, but it needs more players. Real Madrid are now looking for alternatives.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Madrid fans are starting to tremble only with the possibility that <b>Casemiro or Fede Valverde</b> will miss a match. Both have proved to be <b>irreplaceable</b>, the pillars on which Zidane's team stands.</p>
      <p>They are proving pivotal for Real Madrid to work this season and the young Uruguayan has won the spot from the veterans <b>Kroos and Modric</b>.</p>

      <p>But there will come a time that they'll have to get a rest, and although Zidane will always have the possibility of playing the Croat or the German in <b>Casemiro or Valverde</b>'s position, the best option nowadays seems to be looking for a new 'stopper'.</p>
      <p>And this, according to 'Fichajes.com' could come from <b>Lyon or Monchengladbach</b>. According to this source, both the 21-year-old <b>Jeff Reine-Ad√©laide</b> and the 22-year-old <b>Florian Neuhaus</b> are on their radar.</p>
      <p>They are 2 <b>very young players</b>, and if<b> Real Madrid sign one of them, they will have the CDM position covered for a long time</b>.</p>
