      <p>Oklahoma State received a formal notice of allegations from the NCAA on Friday, including one Level I violation involving former associate head coach Lamont Evans.Evans is one of the four former college basketball assistant coaches at the heart of the FBI’s probe into college basketball, shoe companies and money being moved outside the purview of universities.</p>
      <p>A former assistant with the Oklahoma State Cowboys, Evans already received his punishment. In June, he was sentenced to three months in prison for accepting bribes to push players to certain agents and financial gurus.</p>
      <p>According to the NCAA, mostly thanks to the FBI’s investigation, Evans "violated the NCAA principles of ethical conduct when he knowingly solicited and received benefits for facilitating or arranging a meeting between student-athletes and financial advisors" from April 2016 to September 2017.</p>
      <p>Mike Boynton became the head coach of the Oklahoma State Cowboys in 2017, serving as an assistant for one season the year prior. There are no currently known direct connections between Evans’ actions and if Boynton knew anything about it.</p>
      <p>Moreover, there are only three players left on Oklahoma State’s roster from Evans’ tenure, with none of the upperclassmen alleged to be involved in any NCAA infractions.</p>
      <p>In fact, the formal notice of allegations from the NCAA is geared toward Evans, who was removed from his post almost instantly when the FBI began its probe.</p>
      <p>"We have been open and transparent with our team, our recruits and the NCAA," Oklahoma State coach Mike Boynton said after receiving the formal notice of allegations. "We're disappointed this occurred but are pleased that a thorough investigation has determined the most serious violation was reported in the news more than two years ago. We look forward to presenting our case on the level of violation to the NCAA."</p>
      <p>The university also released a statement, more than inferring its ready to move on:</p>
      <p>"Following the NCAA's thorough investigation with OSU's full cooperation and participation, the University agrees that Mr. Evans did in fact accept bribes for the purpose of steering players to financial advisors in violation of NCAA bylaws. While OSU is very disappointed that this occurred, we were relieved to learn that there were no recruiting or other major violations on the part of the institution. There are no allegations involving current student-athletes or coaching staff.</p>
      <p>"The NCAA enforcement staff is of the opinion that the Committee on Infractions might consider this to be a Level I violation by the institution. The University feels strongly that the bribes were taken for the sole benefit of Mr. Evans who was terminated within days of the announcement of the charges. The University did not benefit in any way and was considered by the Federal government to be the victim of the scheme. As such, we have asked to appear before the Committee on Infractions to present our position on the level of violation."</p>
      <p>Letter of the (NCAA) law suggests Oklahoma State could face increased punishment. A loss of scholarships, a fine, reduced recruiting period and/or even be put on probation.</p>
      <p>However, the NCAA does not allege any recruiting violations against Boynton or Oklahoma State. Furthermore, the allegations do not even mention Brad Underwood, now with Illinois, who hired Evans at Oklahoma State and was the school’s head coach at the time.</p>
      <p>Rarely are these cases just a single bad apple operating alone; though this appears to be the exception to the rule. By all accounts, federally legal and within the NCAA’s own allegations, everything alleged was done by Evans for the sake of his own benefit.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma State will have a chance to plead its case to the NCAA. If the governing body of college sports can implement the tiniest fraction of common sense, the Cowboys should be able to move past this scandal without increased punishment. It’s a big ask out of the NCAA, as the organization often wields its power in heavy-handed and misguided ways.</p>
      <p>Still, blue-blood programs are operating without much noise around them, with a few schools still employing names whispered to be involved in nefarious actions. The NCAA can only prove what it can regarding whoever with whatever evidence it has, but everything connected to Oklahoma State screams it was a solo job.</p>
      <p>Neither fans or media are looking for blood in this situation. There’s sincerely none to be had. If the NCAA wants justice in this case, it’ll accept Oklahoma State’s statement as fact, move on and let the college basketball landscape keep trucking along.</p>
      <p>There’s bigger fish to be fried. For the NCAA, in context relative to the Oklahoma State Cowboys, there was only fish to be had, and he’s already faced his punishment. No need to keep looking for nails to be hammered when they’re all already walloped into the ground.</p>
