      <p>Brokerages remained positive on India's largest power generation company, <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/power-generation-distribution/ntpc/NTP">NTPC</a>, on attractive risk-reward, pickup in capitalization and decline in fuel under recoveries.</p>
      <p>Morgan Stanley has upgraded its rating on the stock to overweight as risk-reward turned attractive.</p>
      <p>The global brokerage house has a target price for the stock at Rs 152 per share, implying 32 percent potential upside from current levels.</p>
      <p>"The risk-reward turned attractive as two out of three concerns are either reversing or are known; and steady commissioning of projects should drive earnings," the research firm said.</p>
      <p>"Fixed costs under recovery has been reducing, and the impact of regulations is known though the potential stake sale by the government remains an overhang," it added.</p>
      <p>Motilal Oswal also said the uncertainty over the transaction value and continued government divestment could be an overhang on the stock in the near term.</p>
      <p>However, the brokerage remained positive on NTPC from a medium-term perspective led by the pickup in capitalization and the decline in fuel under recoveries – which should drive 14 percent earnings over FY19-21.</p>
      <p>"We maintain buy with a DCF-based target price of Rs 163, implying 42 percent potential upside from current levels," said Motilal Oswal.</p>
      <p>the Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs (CCEA) has given an in-principal approval (link) for the sale of the Government of India (GoI)'s holding in NEEPCO (100 percent - GoI holding ) and THDC India Ltd (75 percent holding) to NTPC.</p>
      <p>The acquisition of these new capacities (including under-construction ones) adds 5 GW (10 percent of NTPC capacity) of mostly hydro power assets to NTPC's largely coal dominated asset base, said JM Financial.</p>
      <p>"THDC is the better assets with superior return on equity (RoEs) while NEEPCO is sub-optimal and, hence, its acquisition value should also reflect the same. Also, a higher debt-funded acquisition would be more value accretive for NTPC, given it has access to low cost debt," it added.</p>
      <p>The brokerage said both additions would be earnings accretive for NTPC at the fair value. With NTPC’s strong balance sheet (FY19 net D/E at 1.3x) and annual profits of Rs 10,000-12,000 crore, these are easily funded from two-three years of internal accruals.</p>
      <p>THDC (around 1.5GW) and NEEPCO (around 1.45GW) are broadly a hydro-dominated portfolio, with the combined hydro capacity of 2.3GW.</p>
