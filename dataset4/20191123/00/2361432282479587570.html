      <p>Comedy Central has debuted the first original sketch from its new partnership with The Second City, and just in time for your Thanksgiving trip home, it’s a riff on the eternal bleakness of hometown bars around the holidays.</p>
      <p>“‘Twas the night before Thanksgiving and all through the city / the booze began flowing — folks about to get s—ty,” the bartender in the sketch says melodically as he pours drinks for an increasingly drunk and increasingly sad crew of former high school friends. “When what to my wandering eye should appear? / Every D-bag from high school reuniting right here.”</p>
      <p>The sketch, titled “What Every Bar in Your Hometown Is Like on Thanksgiving Eve,” was directed by Alice Mathias. Ryan Asher, Tien Tran, Tyler Davis, Jeff Murdoch, Kelsey Kinney, Nate Varrone and Tim Kazurinsk star.</p>

      <p>The sketch is the first in Comedy Central’s digital partnership with the comedy theater, with more original comedy sketches set to roll out on the Viacom network’s digital channels next year.</p>
      <p>“Working with Second City is an incredible opportunity to merge two of the most iconic brands in sketch comedy,” said Steve Elliott, vice president of talent and development for Comedy Central Digital. “Plus, they had killer recommendations for the best Deep Dish in Chicago. We can’t wait to do more with Second City and build on the immense success we are seeing with our Comedy Central original digital content.”</p>
      <p>Comedy Central has made digital content a key part of its strategy in the last year, touting year-over-year growth on social media and digital thanks to extensions of linear series like “The Daily Show,” as well as online originals like the “Mini-Mocks” sketch series on Facebook.</p>
      <p>The Second City partnership builds on the network’s existing approach of uploading sketch content from its library of shows to YouTube, including bits from “Key &amp; Peele,” “Alternatino with Arturo Castro” and “Chappelle’s Show.”</p>

          <figcaption>If you're looking for something a little different to listen to this holiday season, you've come to the right place. TheWrap has found some "interesting" options to your standard Sinatra, Buble or Mariah Christmas tunes that'll either have you singing along… or scratching your head.</figcaption>

          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MrHankeysChristmasAlbumSouthPark.jpg"/>
          <figcaption><b>"Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics"</b>  If you're a fan of "South Park," this is a must-have for you. It harkens back to a 1999 holiday-themed episode of the adult animated sitcom in which a, well, piece of poo comes alive and starts singing Christmas carols. And this album was born. Among the "untraditional" yuletide cuts are "Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo," Merry F---ing Christmas," "What the Hell Child Is This?" and "The Most Offensive Song Ever."</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Christmas in the Stars: Star Wars Christmas Album"</b>   And you thought you had seen just about every "Star Wars" marketing gimmick possible, right? Well you were wrong. Following the release of "The Empire Strikes Back" in 1980, producer Meco Monardo created an entire Christmas-themed album. Not only does it include spoken lyrics by C-3PO and bleeps from R2-D2, it also boasts Jon Bon Jovi three years before his band was formed. Songs include "Christmas in the Stars" and "What Can You Get a Wookie for Christmas?"</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Hung for the Holidays"</b>   Remember William Hung, the 2004 "American Idol" contestant who grabbed 15 minutes of fame for his rendition of Ricky Martin's "She Bangs"? Well, he's cranking out holiday tunes now, like "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer" and "Winter Wonderland." Good for a giggle or two… or just the need to put a smile on your face.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Snoop Dogg Presents Christmas in tha Dogghouse" </b>   Let's just say the word "explicit" is tagged on to the title of every song. Like "My Little Mama Trippin on Xmas," "Christmas in the Hood" and "A Pimp's Christmas Song." Snoop Dogg's 2008 album may not be right for the kiddies, but his funkadelic rap style blends surprisingly well with holiday cheer.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Sugar &amp; Booze"</b>     "SNL" alum Ana Gasteyer showcases her singing talent in her new holiday album that she says "is a nod to the swing sound of the '50s and '60s but with a modern twist. It is festive, with a full-bodied sound, that I hope makes people feel joyful, jolly and gay." Mission accomplished. Among the tracks are a "Secret Santa" duet with Maya Rudolph and a retro-Cuban beat, a Mambo take of "Sleigh Ride" and original songs like "Nothing Rhymes With Christmas."</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Christmas at Luke's Sex Shop"</b>   If the title of the album or the "parental advisory" label on its cover doesn't grab your attention, maybe the songs will. The Miami rap group 2 Live Crew gives new meaning to "naughty or nice" with this collection thanks to its heretical tracks, including, "Ho Ho Hoes," "Christmas Spliff" and "Christmas F---in’ Day." Egg nog and mistletoe, anyone?</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Christmas Eve with Colonel Sanders"</b>     Who doesn't like that old holiday tradition of listening to carols while unwrapping presents Christmas morning… while noshing on a bucket o' wings? Col. Harland David Sanders – the white-bearded old guy with the jolly disposition who is <i>not</i> Kris Kringle – released albums three consecutive Christmases starting in 1967. Offered at his restaurant chain KFC (then called Kentucky Fried Chicken), they were a compilation of popular artists at the time. Does the Colonel sing? No, not really. But he <i>does</i> rock a Santa hat like no other.<cite>RCA Victor</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Christmas Time With The Three Stooges" </b>Yes, you read that right. The raucous slapstick trio originally cut a Christmas album in 1960. But if you're looking for "Silent Night" or "Little Drummer Boy," this album is not for you. Among the selection of songs is "Down Through the Housetop" (with wacky sound effects), "We're Coming to Your Home" and "I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas." As <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24ZQ9WZGKIXY5/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B002E05IVU">one Amazon buyer wrote</a>, it's "kind of obnoxious but the kids love it."<cite>Comedy 3 Entertainment</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Shatner Claus – The Christmas Album" </b>William Shatner adds his comedic spin to 13 holiday classics, making them more like exaggerated dramatic readings then songs you'd hum along to. From a punk rock version of "Jingle Bells" to "Feliz Navidad" delivered with exclamation points, it's just about as entertaining as it gets… even if you're not a Trekkie.

In addition to songs performed by special guests including Alison Krauss and George Strait, the Robertsons sing "Ragin' Cajun Christmas," "You're a Mean One Mr. Grinch" and "Hairy Christmas." By the way, in 2013, this album debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Album chart.<cite>EMI Nashville</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"A Heavy Metal Christmas"</b>    Christopher Lee – yes, the actor that played Count Dracula, a Bond villain and the baddest of baddies in "Lord of the Rings" and the "Star Wars" franchise – also has an operatic bass voice and is totally into heavy metal. No joke. Although there are only two tracks on this album ("Little Drummer Boy" and "Silent Night"), it's pretty cool… especially since he was 90 when he recorded it.<cite>Charlemagne Productions</cite></figcaption>

It goes without saying that the language is naughty in each track and the subject matter veers pretty far from the virgin birth of baby Jesus. Among the ditties, RuPaul's version of "All I Want for Christmas," which includes a request for cheek implants and buttock augmentation.<cite>RuCo, Inc</cite></figcaption>

It's true. Lorne Greene (Ben), Michael Landon (Little Joe), Dan Blocker (Hoss) and Pernell Roberts (Adam) all show off their musical talents performing Christmas standards like "Deck the Halls" and "The Newborn King." You'll love it so much you'll shout "yee-haw!"<cite>BMG Special Products</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"The Night Before Christmas"</b>     David Hasselhoff is a triple-platinum selling pop superstar in Europe. Yes, the "Knight Rider" and "Baywatch" guy is a bona fide Elvis in Deutschland. That said, it was no surprise when in 2004, he released this Christmas album with songs like "Joy to the World" and "God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman." But if you go, "What is he saying? I… I don't understand" when he sings "Silent Night," that's because he sings it in German. In other words, Frohe Weihnachten und ein glückliches Neues Jahr.<cite>edel records</cite></figcaption>

The good news is that both Schneider and Wopat can sing, and they do it well. In fact, they harmonize. On the flip side, they do a tongue-in-check version of "Baby It's Cold Outside" with a lyric rewrite to "Johnny It's Cold Outside." 'Nough said.<cite>Tom Wopat Inc.</cite></figcaption>

Those who grew up with the Brady kids will like the album for sentimental reasons, but one Debbie Downer <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RE12VVSSL0NZ3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B000W297VY">on Amazon wrote</a>, "This is what you get if you've been a bad little boy."<cite>Geffen Records</cite></figcaption>

It features "The Magic of Christmas Day (God Bless us Everyone)" with Celine Dion, "Gonna Eat For Christmas" with Gloria Estefan and "Christmas Baby Please Come Home" with Cher.

The Grammy-nominated Deschanel lends her smooth and deep jazzy singing style (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGEQ13DK1U49A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B005V4FJC4">one Amazon buyer</a> says "Zooey's voice is pure silk") to songs like "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" and "Silver Bells."

Kelley dramedy; it's more or less a showcase for Vonda Shepard (who was Ally's singing voice) with a little help from the series regulars. Calista Flockhart (Ally) gives her best comedic, seductive take on "Santa Baby," while Jane Krakowski (Elaine) sings "Run Rudolph Run" and Lisa Nicole Carson (Renee) tackles "Santa Claus Got Stuck in My Chimney." Oh, and a duet with Robert Downey Jr. (Larry) is thrown in for good measure.<cite>Sony</cite></figcaption>
