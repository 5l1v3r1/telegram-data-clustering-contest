      <h1>Please Enjoy Julia Jacklin Absolutely Slaying Avril Lavigne’s ‘I’m With You’</h1>

      <p><a href="https://junkee.com/tag/julia-jacklin">Julia Jacklin</a> has good taste.</p>
      <p>That’s obvious from her music, which draws from influences as diverse as King Crimson and the confessional honesty of ’80s lost pop star Lewis. And it’s clear from her excellent choice of covers.</p>
      <p>I mean, who can forget Jacklin’s chilling and heartfelt version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhSzpJOestE">The Strokes’ ‘Someday’</a>? On that Like A Version classic, Jacklin managed to hew close to the joys of an original while also keeping things new enough as to feel fresh and entertaining. It was a cover by someone who deeply loves the OG band, but knows the best way to honour them is not to simply mimic them.</p>
      <p>Now, Jacklin has applied that formula to another all-time classic: Avril Lavigne’s ‘I’m With You.’</p>
      <p>The musician covered the song while on tour, at her stop in Warsaw. Stripping down the song to its most essential basics, the musician made it sing in new and unexpected ways, making the old fresh again.</p>
      <p>Basically, the whole thing is incredible, and it should only be a matter of days before Lavigne herself responds.</p>
