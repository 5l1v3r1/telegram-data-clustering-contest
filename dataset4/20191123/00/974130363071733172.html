      <p>Racing's two first-half tries would have had Mike Prendergast beaming with pride as the French side started with a bang in Thomond Park.</p>
      <p>Munster welcomed Prendergast and two other former players in Simon Zebo and Donnacha Ryan to town for the Champions Cup clash. They received a warm greeting prior to the tie.</p>

      <p>Zebo played a part in the second when he stood into the line for a strong carry before Teddy Thomas roared down the wing. However, Munster's own Keith Earls responded in style as he powered past his former team-mate.</p>
