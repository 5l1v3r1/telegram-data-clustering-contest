      <p>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Former Iowa <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-vilsack/">Gov. Tom Vilsack</a> is endorsing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Joe Biden</a>, saying his personal losses give him the “the capacity to comfort” and “the need to heal” a divided nation.</p>
      <p>During a rally in Des Moines on Saturday, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-vilsack/">Vilsack</a> says the former vice president is best able to win the upper Midwest, key to Democrats in 2020.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-vilsack/">Vilsack</a> says the deaths of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Biden</a>’s first wife and infant daughter decades ago and his older son’s death from cancer in 2015 make him “a man with empathy, and a man who has the heart of a president.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-vilsack/">Vilsack</a>, a former U.S. secretary of agriculture, served with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Biden</a> in the Obama administration.</p>
