      <p>WWE Friday Night SmackDown was yet another night filled with interpromotional brawls. The broadcast was bolstered by a rowdy Chicago, Ill. crowd as WWE enters its first Friday-to-Monday pay-per-view cycle with SmackDown, NXT TakeOver, Survivor Series and Raw all taking place in the Allstate Arena. The show was highlighted by Sami Zayn introducing a beautiful new Intercontinental Championship. Please understand that anybody who will go on to complain about this work of art—and there will be some—really actually hates themselves.</p>
      <p>SmackDown’s viewership slid this past week with just 2.35 million viewers. This is the lowest viewership total for SmackDown since WWE’s move to Fox.</p>

        <b>Rhea Ripley def. Charlotte Flair and Sasha Banks</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sasha Banks noted NXT invaded Friday Night SmackDown, so SmackDown invaded them right back. It was a succinct description of WWE’s 50/50 booking philosophy.</p>
      <p>At one point during the opening-segment brawl, there were at least three blonde-on-blonde confrontations. I always knew WWE had too many blondes but good lord.</p>
      <p>Several WWE matches this week have ended with a non-contest due to a wild brawl. With 12 women surrounding the ring, there was a clean finish.</p>
      <p>Go out of your way to watch the finish to this match.</p>
      <p>Sami Zayn Confronts King Corbin</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sami Zayn Reveals New Intercontinental Championship</b>
      </p>
      <p>Considering <a href="https://www.wwe.com/videos/cody-rhodes-reveals-the-classic-intercontinental-championship-hell-in-a-cell-2011">who originally introduced the previous Intercontinental Championship design</a>, this change is long overdue.</p>
      <p>This was one of the smoother championship reveals in recent history, with surprisingly limited belt shaming. In fact, I’ll be actively blocking anybody who doesn’t think this new Intercontinental Championship is absolutely beautiful.</p>
      <p>Sami Zayn challenged Baron Corbin to call him annoying to his face, in the ring, then the camera panned out and he was in street clothes and any hope of him making an in-ring return was dashed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Undisputed Era def. The New Day and Heavy Machinery</b>
      </p>
      <p>‘Of all the branded teams to be one of the few to succumb to infighting, I would have never guessed Heavy Machinery and The New Day. In fact, as of this writing, the currently pinned tweet WWE’s Twitter timeline is literally a livestream of Heavy Machinery and The New Day eating turkey together.</p>
      <p>If WWE follows up all these NXT wins with more NXT wins during Survivor Series, WWE might see its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2019/11/21/wwe-nxt-scores-first-ratings-win-over-aew-dynamite-with-star-studded-show/#6493f6555384">first win streak of the Wednesday Night Wars.</a></p>
      <p>
        <b>Daniel Bryan and The Miz Battle to a No Contest</b>
      </p>
      <p>So, Daniel Bryan is the <i>babyface </i>in this feud, right?</p>
      <p>So, The Miz is still a <i>babyface, </i>right?</p>
      <p>Nobody is better at pretending to genuinely hate one another than Daniel Bryan and The Miz.</p>
      <p>Both The Miz and Daniel Bryan are taking turns being unlikeable. <i>Who should I be rooting for?!</i></p>
      <p>After Hell in a Cell, The Fiend has really taken a liking to this non-finish thing after this match ended via his own mandible claw.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Shayna Baszler Calls Out Bayley</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bayley was one of the few SmackDown Superstars to get an edge over an NXT Superstar, but to be fair whenever I see Bayley these days I just pretend like she’s the NXT version.</p>
      <p>I’m glad WWE wasn’t foolish enough to give away a Bayley vs. Shayna Baszler one-on-one match with no build.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Baron Corbin, Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode def. Roman Reigns, Shorty G and Mustafa Ali</b>
      </p>
      <p>Team Raw pouring into the building wearing red made them look like an army of ants.</p>
      <p>Team SmackDown running into the building led by Braun Strowman and both his fragile knees was hilarious.</p>
      <p>Team NXT was going for a D-Generation X tribute with its entrance, but it looked more like the movie poster for <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1057/4964/products/the-warriors-vintage-movie-poster-original-21x31.jpg?v=1561691820"><i>Warriors</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns had to set things off by fighting each other to prove this brand loyalty thing is real.</p>
      <p>If ever there was a way to overdose on WWE interpromotional brawls it would have happened by now. I don’t care if AEW came through the crowd and jumped NXT, I’m over interpromotional brawling.</p>
