        <b>No Pep Guardiola side has ever managed less possession in a top-flight game than Manchester City did in their win over Chelsea.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> claimed a valuable Premier League victory over<b> Chelsea </b>on Saturday, despite<b> recording the lowest share of possession </b>any Pep Guardiola side has managed in a top-flight game.</p>
      <p>During his stints in charge of <b>Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City</b>, Guardiola has become synonymous with dominance of the ball.</p>
      <p>Yet his side's <b>2-1 win against Chelsea</b> at the Etihad Stadium, secured by goals from <b>Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez </b>after <b>N'Golo Kante</b> had given the visitors the lead, was notable for City managing a possesion figure of just<b> 46.74 per cent</b>, according to official Opta data.</p>
      <p>That represents <b>the lowest figure any Guardiola side has registered</b> in 381 top-flight games.</p>

      <p>"It's not that easy, people expect us to have 70 per cent of the possession, <b>but these guys [Chelsea] have a lot of quality,"</b> said ex-Blues midfielder De Bruyne in a post-match interview with Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"It shows the other side we have, that<b> we can control the game while defending </b>and that's also good for us."</p>
