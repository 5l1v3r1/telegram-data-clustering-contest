      <h1>Height of Auto-cracy: Beware of criminals, he said &amp; then hit him with an iron rod</h1>

      <p>If you’re a longtime resident of Bengaluru, you will know that there are many kinds of auto drivers. Those who ask for one-and-hoff, those that take you on a circuitous ride, those that refuse to ply no matter where your destination, those that prefer to sit under a tree and read a newspaper with no care about earning an income, those that ask for astronomical fares… And then, there is this auto driver who can foretell crimes and will carry them out as prophesied. <br/><br/>On Sunday night-Monday morning, at around 1.30 am, Narendra Devagirakar, 26, a resident of Mariyannapalya, fell victim to a chatty auto driver who first warned him about the rising crime in the city and then attacked him with an iron rod, after dropping him off near his house near Manyata Tech Park. <br/><br/>Devagirakar, an employee of a private company, later filed a complaint at the Amruthahalli police station. According to the complaint, Devagirakar met some friends for dinner on Sunday night, in Veeranapalya. The incident took place around 1:30 am when he was on his way home. Narendra said, “It was late and though my house is just half a kilometre away from the restaurant, I decided to take an auto instead of walking home. The auto driver I spoke to demanded Rs 40 but later agreed for Rs 30. I sat in the auto and he began chatting about the rising crimes in the city and the area we were in was quite notorious for such activities. He told me that I should be careful. I agreed with him and didn’t say anything. When we reached near my house, I got down and paid him the fare.” <br/><br/><br/>That was not the last Devagirakar saw of him. The victim said, “He then asked me which of the houses on the street was mine and I replied that it was nearby and I would take a walk. As I started walking towards my house, he followed me in his auto. My earphones were still on and the music was still playing when he asked me where I stay. I found it a little suspicious and told him that it was within waling distance and asked him to carry on. He then suddenly intercepted me with his auto and asked me the same question again. This time I didn’t react and started walking ahead when he attacked me from behind with an iron rod. I turned around to stave off another attack when he hit me on the head and snatched my bag. He tried taking my phone from my pocket and while I was resisting, he took my wallet. When I held fast on to my wallet, the money from the wallet fell down on the road. My head started bleeding due to the injury and when he bent down to pick up the cash, I fled. I immediately informed the police and my parents. It was just 100 meters away from my house and my parents rushed out to my help,” he said. <br/><br/>He added that his father tried to chase the auto driver but by then he was gone. Devagirakar was immediately rushed to the nearby hospital by his parents for treatment. He sustained a 12 cm deep cut on his head and had to get six stitches. He said that the auto driver stole Rs 400 and his bag which contained a rain coat, a pullover, a mobile charger and a few other things. <br/><br/><br/>He said that by the time the police reached the location, he had already reached the hospital and the driver had fled. Amruthahalli police have registered a case. The police are now on the lookout for the unknown auto driver who warns his victims about impending crime.</p>
