        <b>Italy are showing support against domestic violence. Serie A wanted to show their support to all the women who suffer or who have suffered this type of violence. In the Atalanta v Juventus game, the players and the referee had a red mark across their face to raise awareness.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The campaign is called "Show violence the red card." Therefore, the 11 Atalanta players as well as the <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> ones <b>went out with a mark on their face</b>. </p>
      <p>This initiative is promoted by Serie A. <b>They want to raise awareness </b>and end domestic violence once and for all. </p>

      <p>The image will be repeated across all games played in Italy throughout the week. "<b>Serie A supports 'WeWorldOnlus'</b>, an organisation which, for 20 years, defends the rights of women and children in danger both in Italy and in the world. <b>The objective is to combat all types of injustice</b> towards women," Serie A published in a statement. </p>
      <p>Domestic violence is a real problem. <b>In Italy they want to raise awareness </b>and show support for women who suffer domestic violence. For this reason, <b>the players went onto the pitch in Bergamo </b>for the Atalanta-Juventus match with a red mark across their face. </p>
