      <p>Member of Parliament for Effutu constituency, Alexander Afenyo-Markin, has advised the Auditor-General to remain calm and cooperate with ongoing investigations by the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO).</p>
      <p>The governing New Patriotic Party’s Parliamentarian also wants Daniel Yaw Domelevo to cease engaging the media over the tussle between him and EOCO.</p>
      <p>“He shouldn’t be emotional, he should not overly be engaging the media [and] he should relax,” the Afenyo-Markin said Saturday on Newsfile on JoyNews and Joy FM.</p>
      <p>Mr Domelevo is under probe by the EOCO after a private citizen petitioned the anti-graft agency alleging a breach of Act 663 in the Procurement law, in relation to the purchasing of vehicles worth almost GH¢6.2 million for the Audit Service.</p>
      <p>But the Auditor-General in a letter to EOCO has declined to cooperate with the investigation stating that EOCO does not have the power to investigate him.</p>
      <p>“It is quite bizarre and unfathomable why your office would purport to be investigating procurement breaches when and in fact it does not have any legal authority to do so unless there is any hidden or ill motives behind your actions, Mr Domelevo wrote to the EOCO,” he indicated.</p>
      <p>Acting Executive Director of EOCO, Frank Adu-Poku, hit back at Mr Domelevo saying he has no power to interpret laws.</p>
      <p>“Yes, I just received a copy of the letter. But if he [Auditor General] has any difficulty with our mandate, he cannot sit in the comfort of his office and proffer his own interpretation to suit his whims and caprices,” Mr Adu-Poku was quoted by Daily Graphic on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The outspoken Auditor-General then filed an application at the Human Rights Division of the High Court, urging the court to enforce his fundamental human rights in articles 23 and 33 of Ghana’s constitution.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the feud between the heads of the two state agencies, Afenyo-Markin, a legal practitioner, said the Auditor-General should allow EOCO to do its mandated work and not think he is being persecuted.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Domelevo should relax…if he thinks that EOCO is after his blood, all of us are watching. If they have some evidence that you’ve [Domelevo] breached the procurement laws, let them bring it on. On the part of the law he should have no worries,” the MP advised.</p>
