      <p>KARACHI: Geo News obtained the CCTV footage of an incident where police can be seen fleeing after shooting dead one man and injuring another in the wee hours of Friday. </p>
      <p>The CCTV footage shows how police opened fire on a car with two men in it. One of the men, Nabil Hoodhboy, died while the other, Raza Imam, was severely injured. </p>
      <p>The footage revealed that police shot the friends at 3:45 AM and then fled the scene.</p>
      <p>After two-minutes the police mobile came back to the scene and a suspicious double-cabin vehicle can also be seen passing through the same spot at 3:56 AM in the CCTV footage. </p>
      <p>Rescue personnel say they received a call at 4:01 AM after which they arrived at the spot in 18 minutes.</p>
      <p>Hoodbhoy was taken out of the car at 4:44 AM and shifted to the ambulance at 4:52 AM.</p>
      <p>Police claimed that they told the ambulance driver to wait after Nabil was shifted to the ambulance. </p>
      <p>After 1 hour and 23 minutes the ambulance took Hoodbhoy to the hospital.</p>
      <p>When the exchange of fire took place, police officials did not check up on Nabil. </p>
      <h3>DIG South says case registered against police officials</h3>
      <p>Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South on Saturday spoke to Geo News regarding the murder and said an investigation has been launched against the officials involved.</p>
      <p>“The patrolling team made a mistake. We have launched a case against them,” said DIG South.</p>
      <p>“The head constable should have stayed instead of fleeing. He was suppose to give a response call on humanitarian grounds.”</p>
      <p>The high-ranking police official visited Raza at the hospital to check up on his health. </p>
      <p>“Earlier, I met the injured and tried to boost his morale,” said the DIG South.</p>
      <p>“Hoodhboy and Imam did not stop after police asked them to at an intersection at Khayaban-e-Hafiz. This alerted the patrolling team and put them into doubt regarding the two men."</p>
      <p>The DIG South admitted that it was lack of training that led to such a horrific incident taking place. </p>
      <h3>CM Murad meets Imam Raza</h3>
      <p>Chief Minister Sindh Murad Ali Shah on Saturday visited Imam at a hospital, said his spokesperson.</p>
      <p>Murad expressed grief and sorrow for the deceased and hoped that Imam would get justice.</p>
      <p>Imam revealed that he resided and worked in Canada while talking to the chief minister.</p>
      <p>Imam is soon to be discharged from the hospital. </p>
