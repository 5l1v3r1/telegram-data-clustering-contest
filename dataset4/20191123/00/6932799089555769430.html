        <b>Meanwhile, the lesser-equipped Motile M141 with the Ryzen 3 3300U is only $280. These are some of the better laptop deals you can find if you can accept the weak hinges.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With Black Friday just around the corner, major retailers are already offering deals to get a head start. One notable deal is the ultra-thin 14-inch Walmart Motile laptop M142 for just $380 USD down from the original $700 asking price. Newegg has the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/1TS-00AF-00006">exact same laptop</a> for just $535 as well.</p>
      <p>While laptops under $500 are common, they would typically be very slow with outdated processors, low resolution displays, and thick or ugly chassis designs. The Walmart Motile model in question comes equipped with AMD's latest Zen+ CPU that rivals the Intel <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Core-i7-8565U-SoC.317500.0.html">Core i7-8565U</a> as found on most flagship Ultrabooks and with a surprisingly well-calibrated matte 1080p display. In other words, you're getting a similar level of system performance for less than half the price of a fancy Core i7 XPS 13, HP Spectre 13, or Asus ZenBook S13.</p>
      <p>The big catch here is chassis rigidity. The display in particular is susceptible to flexing and the hinges are weak and they tend to teeter. We wouldn't be surprised to see flimsy or broken hinges after a year or two of constant use.</p>
