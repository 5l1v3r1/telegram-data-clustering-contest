      <p>NEW HAVEN, Conn. — The 136th edition of The Game between <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/harvard/">Harvard</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/yale/">Yale</a> has been delayed at halftime after protesters took over the field.</p>
      <p>Students from both schools occupied midfield after the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/yale/">Yale</a> band had finished performing. Some held banners asking their colleges to act on climate change and Puerto Rican debt relief.</p>
      <p>“Hey hey, ho ho, fossil fuels have got to go,” some protesters chanted.</p>
      <p>After a few minutes, hundreds more people stream onto the field. A public address announcement asked them to leave “as a courtesy to the players.”</p>
      <p>“As a courtesy to both teams, the game must resume.”</p>
