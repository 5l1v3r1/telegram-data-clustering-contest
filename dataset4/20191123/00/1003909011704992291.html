      <h1>'We know our daughter has had an impact': Young hero saved lives by donating organs</h1>

      <p>Tanner Fitzpatrick and Mark Klassen live more than 6,000 kilometres apart, on opposite sides of the country, but both proudly sport tattoos that honour the sacrifice of a young Calgary woman who decided as a teenager to become an organ donor.</p>
      <p>Marit McKenzie was 17 years old when she made the life-saving decision to sign her donor card, motivated to do so because best friend Paige Thakker had been the recipient of a donated liver while still an infant.</p>
      <p>Marit wouldn’t have had any idea just how quickly that choice would actually become critical. Just months after making that decision in January 2013, Marit suffered a pulmonary embolism followed by a quartet of cardiac arrests that left her with no chance of recovery.</p>
      <p>“That night, when Marit passed away, the doctor was so brave,” recalled her father, Bruce McKenzie.</p>
      <p>“His first words were, ‘I’m very sorry to tell you this, but Marit is brain dead and will not recover.’ And his very next words were, ‘Would you consider organ donation?’”</p>
      <p>Because Marit had already told mother Susan about her decision, the choice — though heartbreaking — wasn’t a difficult one.</p>
      <p>It’s a possibility few parents ever want to consider: Should one of their children suffer an untimely death, could their organs and tissue be used to help others. In Marit’s case, her own passion about the issue made the process smoother. But organ donation advocates say families don’t always get clarity regarding their loved ones’ wishes before tragedy happens, particularly when it comes to children.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, Marit would share not only her heart, but both kidneys and her liver, all of which were successfully transplanted. She also donated her corneas, granting the gift of sight to two other people, along with donating tendons and bone tissue.</p>
      <p>As Bruce and Susan spent their final hours with Marit in the intensive care unit, little did they know the wheels were already in motion to ensure her dying gift made a difference.</p>
      <p>In Burin, Newfoundland (affectionately nicknamed “The Boot” by its 2,300 or so residents), the Fitzpatrick family received a call they’d been waiting for since their 14-year-old son Tanner was placed on a heart transplant list just six days before Marit’s death.</p>
      <p>“At that time, we didn’t know Tanner was being notified a heart was available and he was getting on a plane from Newfoundland to Toronto,” Bruce said.</p>
      <p>Thanks to Marit’s gift, an anonymous one at the time, Tanner’s life changed almost immediately and after a four-month hospital stay he returned home with the Calgary girl’s strong heart beating defiantly in his chest.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Calgarian Mark Klassen received a kidney and a pancreas from Marit, and like Tanner Fitzpatrick found a way to connect with the McKenzies, through sleuthing, curiosity and help from an anonymous letter sent through donor agencies.</p>
      <p>Both men would later become involved in a hockey tournament started by Marit’s former school, the Calgary Christian School, dubbed the Marit Cup. Three years after his successful transplant surgery, Klassen would drop the puck in the fourth edition of the tourney while Fitzpatrick actually donned his goalie pads to play in the event two years ago.</p>
      <p>Both also sport tattoos commemorating Marit’s sacrifice, with Klassen’s tattoo containing the initials M.M. and the date of his transplant, and Fitzpatrick commemorating his transplant day over his donated heart.</p>
      <p>That generosity of spirit — of young adults deciding to bestow an ultimate gift on others — was also reflected last year in the aftermath of the devastating Humboldt Broncos bus crash. One of the 16 people who died in the crash, Logan Boulet, has become a beacon for the cause of organ and tissue donation.</p>
      <p>The young hockey player’s decision to become a donor was a tribute to his former mentor and fitness coach Ric Suggitt, whose death from a cerebral hemorrhage in June 2017 deeply impacted Logan. Upon learning his friend and mentor was able to save six lives via organ donation, Logan decided that he would sign his organ donor card on his 21st birthday, which occurred a little more than a month before his death.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>His father Toby Boulet said Logan made the pledge to 13-year-old McLaren Paulsen — the son of his billet family in Saskatchewan — a few days before his birthday.</p>
      <p>“Logan said, ‘I’m going to sign my organ card in honour of Ric Suggitt,’ and he said, his exact words were, ‘If Ric can save six lives, so can I,’” Toby said.</p>
      <p>“People who know Logan, no one was surprised. If you don’t know Logan, they’re surprised. They’re thinking, ‘Well you’re 21, what are you talking about that for?’”</p>
      <p>But Logan’s message is vital, said Toby: “He’s not talking about death, he’s talking about life.”</p>
      <p>As news of Logan’s final gift began to spread — and as Canadians mourned the deaths of the young athletes and other Bronco family members killed on a Saskatchewan highway — something remarkable happened.</p>
      <p>From coast to coast, Canadians began signing their donor cards at a rate seldom seen by officials at organ and tissue donation agencies.</p>
      <p>It was soon dubbed the Logan Boulet Effect, and in the days following the April 6 crash, some 100,000 people had registered as donors. In April of this year, which marked the first Green Shirt Day held in honour of Logan’s sacrifice, at least another 60,000 Canadians signed up — about three times more than the average monthly number.</p>
      <p>Unlike the McKenzie family, the Boulets haven’t yet made any contact with the recipients of his organs — his lungs, liver, one of his kidneys, his corneas and his heart, which mom Bernadine listened to during many of Logan’s final 27 hours.</p>
      <p>“I would love to meet them. I would love to meet the person who has Logan’s heart and to listen to his heart again,” said Bernadine, fighting back emotions. “When we were in the hospital, one of the things I really liked to do was put my head on his chest and just listen to his heartbeat. So, I would love to do that again.”</p>

      <p>While individual provinces differ a bit when it comes to regulations, families of organ donors are able to write letters to transplant recipients through various agencies, although the information about the donor must be non-specific. Recipients can then choose to respond, through the same agencies, with similarly vague information.</p>
      <p>In spite of those barriers, both Tanner Fitzpatrick and Mark Klassen were able to deduce on their own that Marit was the one who gave them their second chances at life.</p>
      <p>And for father Bruce, making those connections has been an important part of the healing process of losing his daughter.</p>
      <p>“Susan and I feel blessed that we were able to meet some of the recipients,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It helps build a sense of closure and reality. Because of that, we know our daughter has had an impact.”</p>
