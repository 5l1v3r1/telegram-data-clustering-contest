      <h1>Ratings: 'Will &amp; Grace' Recovers a Bit From Last Week's Series Low</h1>
      <h2>But NBC still settles for last place among Big 4 networks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:35:45+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 00:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/tony-maglio/" target="_blank">Tony Maglio</a></address>
      <p>“Will &amp; Grace” did a bit better this week <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/will-and-grace-latin-grammys-thursday-night-football-ratings/">than its previous one</a>, but NBC still settled for last place among the Big 4 broadcast networks on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Despite a lackluster ratings performance out of its latest “Thursday Night Football” game, Fox easily won primetime. Due to the nature of live sports, the below fast-affiliate Nielsen numbers for Fox should be considered subject to significant adjustment when final figures come in later today.</p>
      <p>Fox was first in ratings with a 2.6 rating/12 share in the advertiser-coveted 18-49 demographic and in total viewers with an average of 9.4 million, according to preliminary numbers. That was all the Indianapolis Colts vs. Houston Texans, a pretty good game that lacked a big brawl like last week’s Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Cleveland Browns game.</p>
