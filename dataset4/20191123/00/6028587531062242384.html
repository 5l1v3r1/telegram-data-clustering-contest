      <p>If you want to sleep on a flight, good luck. From noise-canceling headsets to travel pillows to pills, it seems like everyone has a favorite method of getting some shut-eye onboard. But does any of it work?Let me be blunt: You probably won't sleep well, at least in economy class. That's according to a new study by <a href="https://www.thesleepjudge.com/hacking-sleep-while-flying/">The Sleep Judge</a>, a mattress review site.</p>

      <p>That's right, most air travelers (61%) experienced "below average" or "very poor" sleep on a flight.</p>
      <p>And while we're at it, let's also debunk another myth about sleeping on planes. Reclining your seat back will result in the worst sleep, according to The Sleep Judge.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Yep, leaning forward is the best way to get a little shut-eye.</p>
      <p>"Leaning forward over the tray table is the best seat position for maximizing rest," said The Sleep Judge spokeswoman Haley Green. "Reclining and leaning to the sides are the worst positions."</p>
      <p>I hate to say "I told you" — but I <i>told</i> you. I believe we've run out of room on planes and that seats should be locked in place. I said so <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/advice/2019/11/08/why-economy-passengers-should-stop-reclining-their-airline-seats/4158135002/">in my latest USA Today column</a>, and you wouldn't believe the hate mail I've received. Death threats, even.</p>
      <p>That said, there <i>are</i> ways to sleep better on an aircraft. Even in economy class. </p>

        <b>How the pros do it</b>
      </p>
      <p>Everything about the plane is conspiring against your sleep.</p>
      <p>"It's the narrow tightness of the seat pitch," says Socrates Anastasiadis, a retired financial advisor from Chino Hills, Calif. "It's the obnoxious passengers that push their seats back all the way as soon as the plane takes off. It's the ones who need to go to the bathroom often yet they take a window seat."</p>
      <p><b>Comfortable clothes.</b> "If you’re planning to get some sleep on a flight, you shouldn’t wear jeans that will squeeze your belly," says John Breese, a frequent air traveler and CEO of <a href="https://happysleepyhead.com/">Happysleepyhead.com</a>, a mattress review site. "Your clothes should be loose and comfortable. Besides, since it can get cold on an airplane, you’d better be dressed in something with long sleeves and pants. You may also want to wear warm socks."</p>
      <p><b>Meditation.</b> "In the early days, I used to take a Tylenol PM and melatonin after dinner," says Jeanine Joy, a consultant for the sleep advice site <a href="https://www.sleeptips.org/">Sleeptips.org</a>. "But since I began meditating regularly, I don't feel the need."</p>
      <p><b>Music</b>. "If I need the distraction of sound, I insert some squishy earbuds and keep a few albums by the ambient-music band Marconi Union on my phone," says Robin Catalano, the travel editor for an <a href="https://www.greylockglass.com/">alternative newspaper in the Berkshires</a>. Marconi Union's song "Weightless" was recently named "the most relaxing song in the world" in a marketing study. </p>
      <p><b>Pills.</b> Andrew Steinberg, a travel concierge with Modern Travel, an affiliate of <a href="https://www.ovationtravel.com/">Ovation Travel Group</a> recommends the anti-anxiety drug, Ativan. "I’m a believer in taking the right pill as the best practice," he says. "For those who rarely take sleep medication, Ativan works as a great aid and goes through your body quickly with zero side effects or residual drowsiness."</p>
      <p><b>Pillows. </b>That's the recommendation of Hassan Alnassir, the founder of a toy company. "The main technique I typically use to relax my body and sleep easily on the plane is to use two pillows: one to support my neck and another to support my lower back," he says. "I also wear a comfortable eye mask which helps to block the plane lights and become calmer, without exerting pressure on my head."</p>
      <p><b>Water.</b> Stay away from alcohol, and drink plenty of water to stay hydrated in the dry cabin air. "Water is your best friend," says Brett Manders, an international airline pilot and author of "Behind the Flight Deck Door - Insider Knowledge About Everything You've Ever Wanted to ask a Pilot." "But not <i>too </i>much because what goes in must come out and it is awful to wake up to have to visit the bathroom to then try to get back to sleep."</p>
      <p>The survey results reflect this advice, more or less.</p>

      <p>Note: Alcohol may work as a sleep aid in the short term, but it can really mess with your sleep cycle on a long-haul flight. It can also lead to some very unfortunate in-flight incidents, especially when combined with prescription drugs.</p>

        <b>What's the best seat to sleep on a flight?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps the most important decision: Which seat to book?</p>
      <p>"Get the right seat," says Breese of Happysleepyhead.com. "Window seats are the best option, as you can lean on the wall and let your body relax more. Plus, you won’t have to get up when your neighbor wants to visit the bathroom."</p>
      <p>Actually, it's a little more complicated, according to the latest study.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>According to The Sleep Judge, the window seat may not always be the best choice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The window seat in the front of the plane is the best place for sleep. The middle seat is not terrible. Avoid the aisle!</li>
        <li>In the middle of the aircraft, go for the middle seat. The window and aisle are awful.</li>
        <li>The back of the plane is terrible for sleep, but for your best results, go for the window. Definitely avoid the middle seat.</li>
      </ul>

        <b>How I sleep on a flight</b>
      </p>
      <p>There's no right way to sleep on a flight. As the father of three teenagers, all of whom fly with me most of the time, I always sleep with one eye open. My new favorite headset is a <a href="https://cleeraudio.com/over-ear-headphones/flow-ll-wireless-noise-cancelling-headphone-with-built-in-google-assistant/">Cleer’s Flow II</a>, which offers the best noise-canceling technology I've ever heard — or maybe I should say, <i>not</i> heard. </p>
      <p>For the best sleep, I prefer blankets to pillows and an eye mask is a must. I stay away from alcohol and taking prescription drugs, but I know that for many nervous fliers, these substances can be helpful.</p>
      <p>For most of us, sleeping on a plane is impossible. The seats are just too darned small, the interior cabin too loud. Airlines could easily fix this by offering a civil amount of space to their passengers and upgrading their planes. I hear the Airbus A330neo is really nice. (Anyone got an extra $296 million lying around?)</p>
      <p>The best long-term fix would be to eliminate the class system, giving every seat a generous amount of legroom. But we are years away from reaching that point. By then, air travel probably will be obsolete.</p>
