      <p>LONDON (AP) - Britain’s Prince Andrew continues to face many hurdles despite his decision to step down from royal duties because of his friendship with billionaire sex offender <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-epstein/">Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old prince, who is <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elizabeth-ii/">Queen Elizabeth II</a>’s son, is struggling to stay at the helm of his Pitch&amp;Palace; charity, with some British media reports indicating he has already stepped down.</p>
      <p>A number of the charity’s corporate backers including Barclays have stopped supporting the project, which brings young entrepreneurs together with companies that can help put their ideas into practice.</p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace says Pitch@Palace is in a period of transition and that the ties to the palace will be dropped. It may be known as Pitch in the future.</p>
      <p>Andrew faces continued scrutiny that is expected to intensify when a BBC interview with his primary accuser is broadcast.</p>

      <p>The broadcast with Virginia Roberts Giuffre is set for Dec. 2. She says she had sex with Andrew three times, starting when she was 17.</p>
      <p>Andrew denies the accusation and says he doesn’t have any recollection of meeting her, despite a photograph showing him with his arm around her.</p>
      <p>Giuffre says she was a victim of a sex trafficking scheme operated by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-epstein/">Epstein</a>, a billionaire financier who died in prison in August in what was ruled a suicide.</p>
      <p>Many legal papers relating to the case remained sealed to the public.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Andrew’s troubles reached a crescendo after he tried to end speculation about the matter by giving a live TV interview one week ago in which he didn’t express concern for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-epstein/">Epstein</a>’s young victims and defended his relationship with the financier.</p>
        <p>The backlash was almost instantaneous and led to the extremely rare decision to remove him from a carefully cultivated royal role.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elizabeth-ii/">Queen Elizabeth II</a> hasn’t commented in public on the scandal and showed her support for Andrew Friday by going horseback riding with him on the grounds of Windsor Castle within view of a photographer.</p>
        <p>Some of the victims’ lawyers are calling for Andrew to voluntarily give evidence to U.S. officials or face a possible subpoena that could force him to testify under oath.</p>
        <p>He hasn’t been publicly charged with any crime and it wasn’t clear if U.S. officials investigating <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-epstein/">Epstein</a> want to question Andrew.</p>
        <p>Andrew has admitted he made a mistake by staying at the New York City home of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-epstein/">Epstein</a> after the financier had been convicted of sex offenses.</p>
        <p>British media reported Saturday that Andrew and his family had also been guests at the home of a wealthy Canadian who had been accused by several women of sexual harassment.</p>
