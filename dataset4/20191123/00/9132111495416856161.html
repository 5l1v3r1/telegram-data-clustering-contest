      <p>Residents of Sekondi-Takoradi and its environs are grappling with acute water shortage since Monday, November 18.</p>
      <p>The acute water shortage has come about following the malfunctioning of the transformer at the water company’s main treatment plant at Daboase in the Wassa East district.</p>
      <p>The company is unable to pump or serve many people within the Sekondi-Takoradi Metropolis and the Effia Kwesimintsim Municipality.</p>
      <p>The unexpected situation has left many to rely on other unhygienic sources of water, a situation that could cause water-borne diseases.</p>
      <p>Many now rely heavily on sachet water for cooking and bathing. A worker with a bank in Takoradi told Empire News’ Emmanuel Ohene-Gyan that he had to skip bath on Friday November 22nd, 2019.</p>
      <p>Western Regional Communications Officer for Ghana Water Company, Nana Yaw Barimah-Barnie responding to the situation appealed to residents to remain calm as the company finds means to replace the faulty transformer.</p>
      <p>However, sources within the company also revealed that the crane hired by the water company from Kumasi to fix the problem also broke down.</p>
