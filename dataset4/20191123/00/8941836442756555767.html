      <p>PHOENIX (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/phoenix/">Phoenix</a> will no longer use red-light and speed-enforcement cameras at intersections starting with the new year.</p>
      <p>A proposal to extend the contract for the cameras beyond Jan. 1 failed by a 4-5 City Council vote Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Councilman Michael Nowakowski told KJZZ radio he voted against the extension because city staff never supplied him with the information he requested months ago.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/phoenix/">Phoenix</a> currently has stationary red-light cameras at 12 intersections in addition to mobile speed-enforcement units that can be moved around school zones.</p>

        <p>Council briefing material said the program generated more than $7 million in net income from Sept. 1, 2009 through Sept. 30, 2018, from more than 205,000 complaints filed in the city court about traffic violations.</p>
