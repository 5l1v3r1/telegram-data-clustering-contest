      <p>ISTANBUL (AP) - A car bomb exploded in a northern Syrian town along the border with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/turkey/">Turkey</a> on Saturday killing at least 3 people, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/turkey/">Turkey</a>’s Defense Ministry said.</p>
      <p>The ministry said more than 20 people were injured in the explosion in an industrial zone of Tal Abyad. Turkish troops and Turkey-backed fighters captured the city from Kurdish-led fighters in October.</p>
      <p>The ministry blamed Syrian Kurdish fighters for the attack.</p>
      <p>Two other car bombs have hit Tal Abyad this month, killing at least 21 people.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/turkey/">Turkey</a> is seeking to expand its areas of influence in Syria’s north, pushing Kurdish fighters away from its borders. Ankara views those Kurdish fighters as terrorists for their links to a Kurdish insurgency inside <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/turkey/">Turkey</a>.</p>
