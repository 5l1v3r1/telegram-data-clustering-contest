      <p>Bugg, 25, treated fans to a personal performance at the BBC's Clydeside home on Monday morning.</p>

      <p>Having not played in Scotland for a year, the Nottingham singer-songwriter made the most of his time north of the border.</p>
      <p>He told fans at the <a href="http://bit.ly/2KNOaHt">iconic Barrowlands</a> on Sunday it was "a pleasure to be back".</p>
      <p>And he sent them wild with a <a href="http://bit.ly/2KNOaHt">mix of his classic tunes and some more recent songs</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite his latest offering only coming out the week before the gig, the crowd already knew it word for word.</p>
      <p>Kiss Like The Sun has a country rock jam feel and went down a storm at both his headline slot and his intimate BBC show.</p>
      <p>It is expected Bugg will release his fifth album next year.</p>
