      <h1><i>Grey’s Anatomy</i> Promises a Return to Horniness in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:39:23+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 00:39</time> by <a rel="author">Halle Kiefer</a></address>
      <p>Before the ferry accident, before the plane crash, before those wolves ate those people they ate (These medical professionals cannot catch a break), <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/grey's-anatomy/"><i>Grey’s Anatomy</i></a><i> </i>drew its audience in with the dreamy, steamy erotic entanglements at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. There were plot lines and pairings so hot, they made the words “McDreamy” and “McSteamy” into household names. Now, in a new interview with <i>Deadline</i>, <i>Grey’s</i> showrunner Krista Vernoff promises viewers that the show’s shift back to its original, later timeslot will officially Make <i>Grey’s</i> Horny Again.</p>
      <p>“There are different rules for a 9 p.m. show than there are for an 8 p.m. show, and we hope to take advantage of those rules,” <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/krista-vernoff-greys-anatomy-fall-finale-season-3-station-19-crossovers-1202791781/">Vernoff explained to <i>Deadline</i></a>. “<i>Grey’s</i> was definitely allowed to be a sexier show when it was on at nine o’clock. So we are excited by the change back to our original [Thursday] time slot.”</p>
      <p><i>Grey’s Anatomy </i>has aired on ABC at 8 p.m. for the last eight seasons, after the network moved the hit medical show up an hour in 2014. Now the network will air <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/shondaland/">Shondaland</a>’s <i>Grey’s </i>spinoff <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/station-19/"><i>Station 19</i></a><i> </i>at 8 p.m., with the hope that your thirst for a sexier <i>Grey’s </i>will carry you through until ten. And after 16 seasons and over 350 episodes, it almost certainly will. Both shows will premiere their next seasons on Thursday, January 23, 2020.</p>
