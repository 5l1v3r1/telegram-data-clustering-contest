      <p>When I first conceived the idea of reporting on make-up for men several years ago, it had been my intention to confine the text to a commentary on the revolution within the men's toiletry and cosmetics industry. However, as one of the few writers on the male grooming scene, I am often invited to sample various new product categories and visit the growing number of male grooming stables all with a view that to commenting upon them in the various magazines to which I contribute regularly, evidence enough that modern man is becoming obsessed with looks and smell and now, even make-up. Yes, that’s right, make-up!  Yet, if the male cosmetics industry is an immediate or short-term means of simulating outward youthfulness, what about the long-term market. I have therefore attempted to cover as wide a spectrum as possible; and in doing so I have, I believe, provided a handful of positive guidelines. </p>
      <p>Upon conducting my research, I have noted many views of many eminent and leading specialists. In short, they do not always agree with each other; many times they even disagree strongly. It is important to note that I do not always agree with them either, but their views are important. In my opinion, it is the male consumer who will make claims to product acceptance. As a commentator on male grooming, I have merely attempted to summarize and interpret a portion of the many philosophies of countless experts, scientists, specialists and manufacturers whose jobs revolve around seeing you looking your best during work hours as well as during your leisure time. </p>

      <p>Male vanity may only be skin deep to some, but the estimated size of the global male grooming market alone will have spent an estimated 81.2 billion U.S. dollars by the time we reach 2024. It is time to devote into the all-important business of ourselves. We owe it to ourselves to keep fit, to look good, to stay young. It is of note that an old immovable object meets an irresistible force; <i>something’s </i>got to give. </p>
      <p>In the executive rat race it is youth that counts. It is a young man’s world. You will surely be able to keep up with the pace during your forties and fifties, but ability is not the only criterion. Company images matters, and a boardroom stuffed with graying, balding corpulent tycoons doesn’t impress prospective clients these days. If you neglect yourself, cannot be bothered to put your best face nor your best suit, you put yourself, and the firm you represent, at an immediate disadvantage. It is not enough to feel young. You must appear young and modern.</p>
      <p>The way you look is the way you feel; it’s that simple. Your appearance reflects your attitude towards life; towards human relationships. If you can’t have the real thing during a grueling day in the boardroom, the best alternative is something resembling it. When it comes to looking fresh-faced, you’ve got to be taken at face value and do the proving afterwards. Be mindful that American males are very vulnerable in sensitive regions, health and good looks being two of them. </p>
      <p>The male makeup revolution is really here. Last month, I sampled a new men's grooming brand that puts it all into perspective by promising to have found the answer from tired skin -all in a matter of seconds. <a href="http://stryx.com/">Stryx</a> is a new men’s corrective cosmetics company on a mission to help guys look their best using corrective cosmetic and skincare products. Stryx designs discreet cosmetics for men from the ground up <i>“We want every guy to have the confidence that goes along with that. Here’s our story…</i></p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The company was founded by guys that had embarrassing experiences with cosmetic and skincare products, and knew that there had to be a solution to this simple problem. After all, why is it that if a woman wakes up with a pimple or any sort of skin issue, she has a-million-and-one easy, and socially acceptable ways to fix it, but if a guy wakes up with a zit on his nose, he’s stuck with it all day? When will guys top sneaking into the women’s aisle at drugstores or stealing cosmetics from their girlfriends? </p>
      <p>So the brand commissioned Prime Studio to help, and after close to 2 years of research and development, they launched <a href="http://stryx.com/">Stryx</a> to solve this problem by creating products uniquely designed for men that men can feel comfortable using. They are first and foremost formulated for men’s skin which is more oily, rougher, and thicker than women’s. They are matte, subtle, and imperceptible on the face — and don’t need any sort of brush or sponge to be applied properly. But most importantly, these products are actually designed for men, from the ground up. These are nothing like what you would currently find in the makeup aisle at a drugstore, and are not just women’s products with a “For Men” label slapped on the front of it. At its core, Stryx as a brand is all about making cosmetic products accessible to the average guy.</p>
      <p>To launch Stryx the brand started with the two most commonly used products by men: a <a href="https://www.stryx.com/products/product-01-concealer-tool">concealer tool</a> and a <a href="https://www.stryx.com/products/product-02-tinted-moisturizer">tinted moisturizer</a>. Neither product looks anything like any cosmetic product on the market. Everyone has a different opinion on what our concealer and moisturizer products “look like” - some say a pen, some say a vape, some say a USB… But, most importantly, none assume that it is a makeup product. </p>
      <p>These are products guys can feel comfortable carrying around, sticking in their jacket pocket, or keeping out on their desk at work. The concealer is great for easily covering up blemishes like pimples, scratches, or dark circles either at home or on the go. And the moisturizer is hydrating like any moisturizer you know and love, but with a bit of a tint for reducing redness and hiding acne. It’s time to come in to the modern age and for men to benefit from these sorts of great cosmetic products without the embarrassment.</p>
      <p>I recently had the privilege of speaking with Devir Kahan, STRYX Co-Founder &amp; CEO, Jon Shanahan, Co-Founder &amp; CMO and Isaac Rami, Co-Founder about the brands unique competitive advantage, how they intend to market to men and why they believe that the time is ripe for revolution for men to wear make-up!</p>

      <p>
        <b>Joseph DeAcetis: Talk to Forbes about the history, launch date and DNA of your brand?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Devir Kahan: A little over two years ago, on the greatest day of my life, my wedding day, I woke up with a pimple on my face. It really bothered me, but I had no easy solution to this simple problem. I thought maybe I could get women’s makeup artists at the wedding to cover it up, but ultimately that never happened and so the pimple was there to stay for the 1000s of pictures taken that day. This negative and embarrassing experience nagged at me. After all, why is it that if a woman wakes up with a pimple, she has a-million-and-one easy, and socially acceptable ways to fix it, but if a guy wakes up with a zit on his nose, he’s stuck with it all day? And I found that I was not alone. Countless guys I spoke to were sneaking into the women’s aisle at drugstores or stealing cosmetics from their girlfriends. That’s when I found my early co-founder, Isaac Rami — he built <a href="http://karity.com/">Karity cosmetics</a>and was actually featured on Forbes 30 Under 30 list in 2018. He was also bothered by this problem, and with his expertise in the field helped me build Stryx.</p>
      <p>After all, men’s skin and routines are different than women’s, and so the female products these men are buying won’t work as well as they could. And so after close to 2 years of research and development (and so many prototypes!) we launched Stryx to solve this problem by creating products uniquely designed for men that men can feel comfortable using. They are first and foremost formulated for men’s skin which is more oily, rougher, and thicker than women’s (just think: men shave their faces!). They are matte, subtle, and imperceptible on the face — and don’t need any sort of brush or sponge to be applied properly. But most importantly, these products are actually designed for men, from the ground up. These are nothing like what you would currently find in the makeup aisle at a drugstore, and are not just women’s products with a “For Men” label slapped on the front of it.</p>
      <p>We launched in January of this year with the two most commonly used products by men: a <a href="https://www.stryx.com/products/product-01-concealer-tool">concealer tool</a> that looks like a cool pen and a <a href="https://www.stryx.com/products/product-02-tinted-moisturizer">tinted moisturizer</a>. The concealer is great for easily covering up blemishes like pimples, scratches, or dark circles either at home or on the go. And the moisturizer is hydrating like any moisturizer you know and love, but with a bit of a tint for reducing redness and hiding acne. </p>
      <p>As to my personal background, I graduated Sy Syms School of Business in 2018, and actually came up with the idea for Stryx in my last year there. As we began to grow Stryx we knew we needed to find top-tier talent to help us, which is why we recently brought on Jon Shanahan as co-founder and head of our marketing efforts. I’ll let him tell a little more about himself... </p>
      <p>Jon Shanahan: I knew Devir through his work on <a href="https://www.thepeaklapel.com/">The Peak Lapel</a> for a few years. In 2015 I launched my YouTube channel The Kavalier to review men’s clothing and grooming so we ended up talking about similar brands and sharing experiences. When Stryx launched I covered it on my channel and was intrigued by the market and product especially as I used it frequently as I am usually on camera or speaking at events. With the goal to remove the stigma of men’s cosmetics through education it was a natural fit to bring my content creation to Stryx and handle partnerships as my professional experience at Apple and <a href="https://www.firstinsight.com/">First Insight</a>was entirely business development focused. I see a lot of opportunity in working with partners to have Stryx in front of as many men as possible. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Joseph DeAcetis: In your words, what is your competitive advantage in the men's grooming market?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Devir Kahan: We are, right now, quite simply the only company on the planet that has gone back to step 0 and designed and created cosmetic products from the ground up for men. We’re not just taking stock female products, slapping a “For Men” label on it, and calling it a day. We are redesigning each product with a blank slate and thinking only about what the typical guy would want it to look like, feel like, etc. We’ve got more unique and useful products in the pipeline, and hope to soon offer a full suite of these products to help guys solve various problems related to their face and looking their best.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Joseph DeAcetis: Who is your demographic and why?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Devir Kahan: The majority of our customers are aged 25-45. These are men with people-facing jobs, be it real estate, sales, presenters, waiters/waitresses, models, actors, executives, public speakers, and so on. A majority of our customers have never bought a concealer before in their life, but do spend time each morning tending to their appearance. Our customer surveys and polls have shown that almost all of our customers put time and energy into some sort of fitness routine and exercise regularly. Our customers truly care about their appearances, and want to be at their best. Whether for work, socializing, being on camera, or any number of other reasons Stryx customers care about how they present themselves, and know how to put their best foot forward.</p>
      <p>

        <figcaption>Isaac Rami, STRYX Co-Founder<cite>Photo by Nechama Leitner</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Isaac Rami: We’ve been primarily marketing on social media, Facebook and Instagram the most heavily. We are speaking to our customers where they are, and in a way that resonates with them. We use a lot of user-generated content to show how best our products can fit into a guys’ day-to-day lifestyle, and how to use these products to enhance your appearance. We also see a huge opportunity in partnerships at places like gyms, fitness centers, barbershops, and more. Ultimately, we want to be where our customers are, and provide them the opportunity to experience and purchase Stryx products in a way that makes sense and is easy to understand.</p>
      <p>Jon Shanahan: We’re also going to speak to guys as fellow guys. Too much marketing in this space is either overly sexualized and masculine or current content aimed at guys that are already comfortable buying cosmetics products designed for and marketed to women. Helping guys understand men wearing makeup is not a new phenomenon and the education around application and use is where we can shine. Utilizing video on multiple platforms with written content on our blog, as a trusted resource will help us stand out in a space no one is currently catering to. Many of our customers have also told us that the woman in their life told them it’s time to use this, so having that validation from a partner will go a long way as well. </p>

      <p>
        <b>Joseph DeAcetis: In your words, are men ready for make-up?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Devir Kahan: There is a new article published every few weeks about how “the men’s makeup revolution is upon us.” Yet, when you look around, there are no brands seriously speaking to men or providing real options for them. Guys are already putting plenty of time each morning in front of the mirror refining their appearances. Between hair product, beard oils, moisturizers, and more — it shouldn’t be that men could do everything short of hiding a pimple. <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2019/10/28/as-beauty-norms-blur-one-third-of-young-men-say-theyd-consider-wearing-cosmetics/">A recent study by Morning Consult</a>even shows that 1/3rd of guys already do use, or would be highly interested in using, a cosmetic product daily. The desire and interest is already there. Guys are just waiting for a brand that actually understands them, and that brand is Stryx.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Joseph DeAcetis: Can you elaborate on the approach to the brand and why you developed the brand with guys in mind</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jon Shanahan: Walk into any store that carries skincare products and you’ll see aisles of products for women with a single shelf of men’s products. That’s starting to change now as men are caring more about their appearance and brands are catering to us guys. There is a group of our customers that have purchased or used women’s products in the past but most guys have told us they are not comfortable shopping the women's aisle or carrying that sort of product with them. 70% of our customers have never purchased a cosmetic before which gives us a huge opportunity to educate around this category in a way that no other brand is doing right now. We want to meet guys where they are leading with design and education because once you experience our concealer tool and the gadget nature combined with simplicity of use you get hooked.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Joseph DeAcetis: How can your product be used to serve men better at the office or place of work?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Devir Kahan: Well, I can just tell you some real world examples we have heard from our customers. Say you’ve got a bit client meeting in the afternoon, but you woke up with a big zit on your nose. Or perhaps you’ve got a big presentation, but you got terrible red razor burn when you shaved in the morning. Or maybe you didn’t get enough sleep last night because you were out late (Working? Partying? Does it matter?) And now you have terrible under-eye bags. Stryx products can solve all those problems in just a couple seconds. A swipe and a dab and the zit is hidden, the razor burn gone, and the under-eye bags erased!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Joseph DeAcetis: Should guys wear it on dates?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Devir Kahan: It’s super important that you’re confident when on a date, and that you feel good knowing that you look your best for the person you are trying to impress. And look, every guy inevitably has a few imperfections on his face, but your date doesn't need to know that!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Joseph DeAcetis: Talk to Forbes in detail about the current collection and why it is important for consumers to understand how this is a fresh idea for the modern world?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Devir Kahan: We launched with the two products we knew guys could and did use, but which were not previously designed for men: a <a href="https://www.stryx.com/products/product-01-concealer-tool">concealer tool</a>and a <a href="https://www.stryx.com/products/product-02-tinted-moisturizer">tinted moisturizer</a>.</p>
      <p>Neither product looks anything like any cosmetic product on the market. Everyone has a different opinion on what our concealer and moisturizer products “look like” - some say a pen, some say a vape, some say a USB… But, most importantly, none assume that it is a makeup product. These are products guys can feel comfortable carrying around, sticking in their jacket pocket, or keeping out on their desk at work. The concealer is great for easily covering up blemishes like pimples, scratches, or dark circles either at home or on the go. And the moisturizer is hydrating like any moisturizer you know and love, but with a bit of a tint for reducing redness and hiding acne. It’s time to come in to the modern age and for men to benefit from these sorts of great cosmetic products without the embarrassment.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Joseph DeAcetis: If you could choose one athlete to represent your brand, who would it be and why?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jon Shanahan: DeAndre Hopkins. There’s few other athletes that embody the key elements of our brand: creativity, comfort, and discrete. DeAndre is not a loud guy; but he is incredibly stylish, confident, and embodies the discrete nature of our brand. He’s just a cool cat and like most athletes and celebrities wears makeup to look his best.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Joseph DeAcetis: Talk to Forbes about how technology aided you in the development of your brand?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Devir Kahan: First and foremost it took over a year and dozens of design iterations with our manufacturer to produce our <a href="https://www.stryx.com/products/product-01-concealer-tool">Concealer Tool</a>to our quality standards. They used a multi-million dollar 3D printing machine in order to accurately prototype and test models. No one has ever created a concealer quite like ours before, and so it took a fair amount of effort and technology, as well as a team of NY-based engineers, to figure out how to produce our Concealer Tool at scale. Then, of course, the power of social media was integral to launching our brand, and is absolutely key to our marketing efforts every single day. It makes reaching our target customers in a way that resonates with them easy. Social media is in our very DNA. </p>

      <p>
        <b>Joseph DeAcetis: What are your day-to-day responsibilities?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Devir Kahan: As CEO of a startup company I have my hand in just about everything. From overseeing operations on our next products, to directing our marketing efforts, to speaking to customers and still handling most of customer support personally, I certainly have my hands full, which is why Jon is such a huge help.</p>
      <p>Jon Shanahan: With the strong foundation of branding and design, Isaac’s work on the digital marketing, and a strong product, I am lucky to focus on creating content, messaging for new products in development, partnerships, and diversifying our marketing funnel. We can meet guys where they are whether that’s blogs, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, Tik Tok, or Reddit. Devir and I have experience building communities online and ultimately using our company blog The Peak Lapel as the central space for education and feedback, having that direct communication with our customers will help shape our company, future products, and messaging. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Joseph DeAcetis: Where is the product made and why is it made there?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Devir Kahan: Our products are both formulated and manufactured in South Korea, a place renowned for its quality skincare. We actually work with the leading supplier to some of the world’s biggest skincare and cosmetic brands. Because of this, we’re able to offer the very best possible quality formulations at much more reasonable prices. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Joseph DeAcetis: You have the floor: Talk to my viewers about why they should try this brand now?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Devir Kahan: I don’t want to get controversial here, but I think we as a society need to get over the stigma associated with these products. It’s more than okay to use a bit of concealer to hide a pimple or some under-eye bags. You’re already putting time, effort, and money into your appearance every single day. Don’t let a stupid zit ruin your look. Every guy wants a boost of confidence, be it every single day, or for special occasions. Stryx makes it super comfortable to get that boost of confidence comfortably. There’s really no reason not to! </p>
      <p>Jon Shanahan: When I was a teenager I had acne that has left scars on my face. I wish someone told me when I had that acne that I could do something to cure it AND hide it, but as an adult I feel more confident when those small scars or my razor burn is not visible when I walk into a room. Every guy has something about their skin your eye is immediately drawn to when looking in the mirror and we created a quick and easy way to fix it and give you that confidence boost to take on the world. Every classically handsome guy you admire, and even recent Presidents wear makeup, so there’s no reason every guy can’t utilize the same tools. </p>

        <b>Joseph DeAcetis: What are you future projections and growth strategy over the next few years?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Devir Kahan: Product Line: We have been doing a lot of research with our existing customer base to see what products they want next. This will drive our product line. We have lots of great ideas and designs for our product line that we are previewing with our customers. As a product company, each product we add to our line helps us grow our company and keep customers coming back to us for more. Increased Usage: we also believe that our growth will come from an increased usage rate among men. As men get more comfortable using these products, we will be adding millions of men each year to our customer pool. Global Growth: We are also testing other markets, and intend to launch in other countries as well, like Europe and Asia where the men’s cosmetics markets are already even bigger than they are here in the US. Finally, I should also mention that we are a part of XRC Labs, a NYC-based accelerator that has helped propel our growth these last few months, and strategize with us about continuing to scale going forward.</p>
