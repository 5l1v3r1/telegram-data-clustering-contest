        <figcaption>Realme X2 Pro has finally launched in India. The flagship smartphone comes with top-of-the-line features like a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED 90Hz display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ with up to 12GB RAM. Another news-maker feature of the Realme X2 Pro is its 50W SuperVOOC Flash charge that powers up the device from zero to 100 percent within 35 minutes. Our <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/realme-x2-pro-review-price-in-india-mobile-under-rs-30000-realme-x2-pro-features-king-of-flagship-killers-4655301.html">Realme X2 Pro review</a> tests the battery charging claims and also includes samples of the 64MP quad-camera.</figcaption>

        <img src="https://static-news.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2019/11/Whale-app-from-Facebook.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Facebook has launched a new app called Whale. The app allows users to edit photos with text and stickers in order to create memes that can be shared on social media or forward to their contacts. Users can browse through the stock library photos, click a photo in real-time or choose one from the camera roll. The <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/facebooks-new-whale-app-lets-iphone-users-create-memes-for-free-4660801.html">Whale app also allows users to create their custom image stickers</a> using the crop and cut tools. The app is free to download and has no in-app purchases. Currently available only in the Canadian App Store, it is unknown if, and when the app will be released in other markets.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Google’s cloud game streaming service has been hailed as the future of gaming.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/google-stadias-launch-lineup-of-12-games-leaves-a-lot-to-be-desired-4631781.html"> Stadia rolled out officially on November 19</a> with a total of 22 games.<br/>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order will likely make their way onto Google Stadia sometime in December this year or early 2020. While Google Stadia's promise of a hardwareless era in gaming maybe some of the best news we've received in 2019, the very-limited AAA titles available at launch will undoubtedly make the platform's launch phase challenging to say the least.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Another news-maker for Realme, apart from the X2 Pro launch, was the company's CEO, Madhav Sheth. <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/realme-india-ceo-caught-using-an-iphone-says-was-testing-the-flagship-4650221.html">Sheth was 'caught' tweeting from an iPhone</a>. The tweet, which has now been deleted, shows a ‘Twitter for iPhone’ badge under it. The Twitter police on the internet took a screenshot of the tweet before Sheth could delete it.

        <figcaption>Micro-blogging site Twitter is bringing new features to improve user experience on its app and the web. The company has rolled out an update that allows users to hide replies. The new feature will allow Twitter users to take further action after hiding a reply like blocking the replier too. With the new moderation tool, Twitter wants to give more controls to the tweet author to <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/twitter-now-allowing-users-to-hide-replies-worldwide-4664201.html">hide responses from the main conversation</a> that are off-topic. The second new feature coming soon to Twitter is scheduling tweets. <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/twitter-rolls-out-support-for-tweet-scheduling-on-its-web-app-4660741.html">Scheduling tweets has been a feature</a> available on the standalone Tweetdeck app. Twitter now plans to expand the feature to its main website as well.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Microsoft has announced that it will end support for Cortana on iOS and Android.
