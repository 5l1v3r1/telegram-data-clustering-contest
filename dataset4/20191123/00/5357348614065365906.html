      <p><b>A 53-year-old man was yesterday sentenced to two years in jail by the Corporate Area Criminal Court, four months after he pleaded guilty to three counts of malicious communication under Jamaica's Cybercrimes Act.</b><br/><br/>The court heard that Donovan Powell had posted nude pictures and videos of his ex-girlfriend, American television anchor Darieth Chisolm, after the woman ended their romantic relationship.<br/><br/>Powell was sentenced to one year in prison at hard labour for counts one and two and ordered to pay a one million-dollar fine or serve four months in prison.<br/><br/>The sentences for counts one and two are to be served concurrently. But Powell will not begin to serve the sentences immediately as he has been granted bail, pending the outcome of an appeal against the penalty.<br/><br/>The court heard that during the relationship between Powell and Chisolm he captured nude pictures and videos of her without her consent.<br/><br/>Deputy director of public prosecutions, Martin Swaby, said when the relationship ended Powell used the material to create sexually explicit videos. The videos and pictures were sent to Chisolm and posted to a website he created.<br/>Powell had also threatened Chisolm that he would ruin her credibility and destroy her career, the court was told.<br/><br/>â€” CMC</p>
