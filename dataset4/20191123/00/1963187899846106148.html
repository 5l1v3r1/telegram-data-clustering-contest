      <p>CAIRO – 23 November 2019: Famed Egyptian star Menna Shalaby who recently received Faten Hamama Excellence Award from the 41st edition of Cairo International Film Festival, was hosted on Friday in a master class moderated by American film critic Jay Weissberg on the side-lines of the festival. <br/><br/>Shalaby started her speech by giving credit to the directors she worked with during her career, such as Radwan Al-Kashef, Mohamed Khan, Osama Fawzy, Youssef Chahine, Hala Khalil, Kamla Abu Zekry, Mariam Abu Ouf, among others. <br/><br/>‘’Having a good director is like a treasure because he/she knows how to deal with <br/>actors, make them feel comfortable when they are anxious, or afraid from performing the role’’ Shalaby said. <br/><br/>When asked about the effect playing different characters left on her, she said that the actor has to live with the character, to feel its experience. “Sometimes you get to play a character that was raped, hurt, or witnessed a shock, and this affects you eventually, especially that acting means you don’t act, you have to be natural” Shalaby recounted. <br/><br/>She added that she eases this pressure by comprehensive training ,rehearsals, or seeking professional help to decompress after playing difficult roles. Shalaby explained that getting ready for a role depends on the script as some films might take a month to shoot, while others take more time and may include a long break. <br/>“As an actress, I like to try different ways and play with the director. It is important for the director to offer trust and comfort to his actors,” she added speaking about breaking the tension when being introduced to a new character. <br/><br/>Shalaby spoke about her important experience of working with acclaimed director Yousry Nasrallah in the film ‘’ Ba’ad el Mawke’a’’ (After the Battle) which participated in the Cannes Film Festival as part of the main competition. <br/>On improvisation, Shalaby said that in ‘’After the Battle’’ Nasrallah introduced the characters to the actors and asked them to think what these characters would do, so every actor could bring in their experience and skills to enrich the character. ‘’Some directors depend on improvisation we just stand in front of the camera and say what we feel.’’ <br/><br/>Shalaby admitted that improvisation is quite difficult process but Nasrallah made it easier. The Egyptian star admitted that she regards acting as a hobby. ‘’ I am a professional actress but I like to regard acting as my passion and hobby.’’ <br/><br/><br/>According to Shalaby there is no difference between male and female director what is important is the talent. ‘’ But I can’t deny that I prefer a little bit to work with female directors because we as women feel each other more, but at the end art has no gender’’ Shalaby added. <br/><br/>Shalaby gave an example speaking about her experience with women filmmakers like Hala Khalil’s in ‘’ Ahla el Aw’at’’ (The Best of Times) and ‘’Nawara ‘’ they both were great because, as women they knew how to write about their feelings and reactions.” Women have little bit of an edge when writing about women” Shalaby recounted. <br/>However, Shalaby added that men also can write expressively about women. <br/>‘’We have clever male scriptwriters like Tamer Habib who can understand women <br/>Feelings’’ Shalaby said. <br/><br/>The Faten Hamama award winner actress said it is very important for the actor to have a good relationship with all the movie or the series cast/ <br/><br/>‘’I am performing now a character that is very difficult to mem it is in a psychodrama project, I didn’t perform in this genre before’’ Shalaby said. <br/><br/>Egyptian Tunisian star Hend Sabry gave her friend and colleague the heartthrob Menna Shalaby the Faten Hamamma Excellence Award at the opening ceremony of Cairo International Film Festival. <br/><br/>‘’Menna you deserve this award and I am so proud of you’’ Sabry commented. <br/><br/>At the beginning of her speech after she received the award Shalaby said that it meant a lot to her to receive the award from her friend Hend Sabry. <br/><br/>‘’I dedicate this award to all the directors whom I worked with and learnt from’’ Shalaby said. <br/><br/>Shalaby explained that she is so honoured to be part of the Egyptian cinema industry <br/><br/>‘’I dedicate this award to my mother who helped me to achieve this success’’ Shalaby said.</p>
