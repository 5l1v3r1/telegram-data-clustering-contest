      <h1>Is Hailey Bieber Pregnant? Justin Bieber Sends Hailey A Birthday Message And Says Babies Are Coming</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:05:45+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 00:05</time> by <a rel="author">Charisse Van Horn</a></address>
      <p>Hailey Bieber celebrated her 23rd birthday on Friday, November 22, 2019, and her husband of one year, Justin Bieber gave her a special shoutout on his Instagram page. Not only did he let the world know how much Hailey turns him on, but he has a lot of people thinking that Hailey might be pregnant! Justin praised Hailey for the way she lives her life and dropped a bombshell that babies were coming “next season.”</p>
      <p>The part about Hailey having babies sparked a fury of rumors and gossip that flooded the Internet and has people talking. Hailey hasn’t posted anything on her official Instagram account about her birthday and she certainly hasn’t left any comments that would indicate she might be pregnant, but Justin’s comments have stirred talk.</p>
      <p>Justin Bieber shared a beautiful black and white photo of Hailey in her wedding gown along with a picture of the bride and groom kissing and then he added the following caption.</p>
      <blockquote>“Happy birthday babes! You make me want to be better everyday! The way you live you life is so attractive.. ps you turn me on in every way 😍😍😍😍 next season BABIES.”</blockquote>

      <p>It’s unclear how Justin and Hailey plan to celebrate her birthday but it seems that there aren’t going to be any lavish celebrations. Additionally, the couple wasn’t spotted out in public together today, but the night is still young. Justin and Hailey were both seen working out, but separately.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Friday, Hailey Bieber spoke with Highsnobiety and indicated that she had previously wanted to celebrate her 23rd birthday with a Michael Jordan themed party as his jersey number was 23. Speaking to the outlet, Hailey stated the following.</p>
      <blockquote>“It’s my Jordan year. I’m turning 23 (today, November 22), and I had this idea where I was going to throw a Jordan party and everyone would have to wear Jordan. But I’m just too tired. I don’t want to entertain people.”</blockquote>
      <p>The remarks have also fueled more pregnancy speculation as when a woman first becomes pregnant she tends to experience a great deal of tiredness during the first trimester.</p>
      <p>What do you think Justin Bieber meant in his birthday message to Hailey? Do you think Hailey Bieber is pregnant?</p>
