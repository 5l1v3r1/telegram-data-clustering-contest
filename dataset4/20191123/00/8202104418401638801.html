      <h3>Saskatoon’s Remai Modern art gallery is anticipating declines in revenue from admissions and memberships over the next two years.</h3>
      <p>The gallery intends to focus on fundraising and grants to make up for the lower revenue, according to the 2020-2021 forecast for the art gallery that will be considered by city council at budget talks starting Monday.</p>
      <p>The City of Saskatoon is implementing its first two-year budget covering the years 2020 and 2021. The art gallery is governed by a board appointed by city council and operates in a city-owned building.</p>
      <p>“The revenues for 2020 and 2021 have been budgeted on what the organization feels is achievable based on two years of operations,” Remai Modern interim executive director and chief executive officer Lynn McMaster said in an email Friday.</p>
      <p>“A number of factors have gone into this including the normalization of operations, a softening in the economy and localized construction in the area.”</p>
      <p>Revenue from admissions is expected to drop from $450,000 in this year’s budget to $355,000 in each of the next two years. Membership revenue is expected to decline even more from $480,000 in this year’s budget to $345,000 in 2020 and 2021.</p>
      <p>The gallery is also budgeting to count on $100,000 less in each of the two years from sales at its store. In 2018, the gallery made $303,815 from memberships, $431,806 from admissions and $399,707 from sales at the store.</p>
      <p>Sponsorships and fundraising events are expected to generate more than twice as much in the next two years as is budgeted for this year.</p>
      <p>Remai Modern expects to take in about $555,000 more in 2020 and 2021 from federal grants and foundation grants. Foundation grants are those donated for a specific purpose from a donor like the Frank and Ellen Remai Foundation.</p>
      <p>Overall, the art gallery expects to raise $10.8 million this year. That will rise to $11.3 million next year and $11.5 million in 2021.</p>
      <p>Taxpayers contributed $5.9 million to the gallery this year. The budget forecasts that subsidy to rise to $6.2 million in 2020 and $6.4 million in 2021. Most of the city’s subsidy goes to operating costs.</p>
      <p>The Remai Modern collection includes 8,098 items worth about $47 million, the budget document says.</p>
      <p>The art gallery, which marked its second year of operation last month, recorded 170,000 visits through the first six months of the year.</p>
      <p>The Remai Modern is one of three controlled corporations that operate in buildings owned by the City of Saskatoon.</p>
      <p>SaskTel Centre, which receives no taxpayer support, expects revenue to rise from $18.9 million this year to $19 million next year and $19.3 million in 2021.</p>
      <p>TCU Place receives $500,000 a year from the city, an amount that is expected to stay the same for the next two years. TCU Place revenue is expected to rise from $11.6 million this year to $12 million in 2020 and $12.4 million in 2021.</p>
