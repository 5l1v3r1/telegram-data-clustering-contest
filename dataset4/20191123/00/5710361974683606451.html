      <p>RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is under a new investigation by Rio de Janeiro state prosecutors for allegedly hiring fake employees during his time as a state lawmaker, the state prosecutor's office said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>This is the second state-level probe into Flavio Bolsonaro, who became a federal senator this year. A previous probe, also relating to alleged irregularities over the payment of his state-level staff, was shelved by the supreme court in a decision that is being appealed.</p>
      <p>"The present investigation has a different and independent object," to the previous one, the state prosecutor's office said in its statement.</p>
      <p>Frederick Wassef, Flavio Bolsonaro's lawyer, denied any impropriety, saying his client was innocent.</p>
      <p>"At the end of the whole process it will be proved that there was no illegality," said Wassef.</p>
      <p>The hiring of fake employees to enable lawmakers to pocket their salaries is a well-known scam in Brazilian politics.</p>
