      <p>TEACHERS and parents of students of the Glowell Preparatory School in Portmore, St Catherine, met Thursday for the school's annual prayer breakfast.</p>
      <p>The school's founder and principal Gloria Jack, said teachers and parents meet once a year, in November, to give thanks to Almighty God, through prayers.</p>
      <p>“We salute and celebrate you, our parents. We celebrate you because you have been chosen by the Almighty God for his heritage because children are heritage of the Lord. Parenthood is a life-long journey; as long as you're alive you will be parenting,” said Jack. She added: “We live in an upside-down technological world where man thinks that he is god [so] we have to develop a spiritual relationship with God, as no one can deny the fact that the most important part of our day's activities is when meet together as a family to give God thanks. He has a direct line, a line that never goes busy, and a line that is always working. He is a person who we can always talk with because, regardless of what we may think, He is the Almighty.”</p>
      <p>She urged the parents to bring up their children in a proper way, and not be guided by the world, reminding that the home is the first place where discipline should be taught.</p>
