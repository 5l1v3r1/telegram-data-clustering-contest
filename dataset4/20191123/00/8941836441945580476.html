      <p>ANAHOLA, Hawaii (AP) - Kauai police say speed appears to have played a role in a car crash that killed three people, including two teen boys.</p>
      <p>Police say that about 12:20 a.m. Saturday, a 20-year-old man was driving a gray Toyota pickup at a high rate of speed southbound on Kuhio Highway when the truck crossed into the oncoming lane, hit a guardrail, and came to a stop upside down near a general store, the Honolulu Star Advertiser reports.</p>
      <p>The newspaper reports that the driver and the two boys, both 16 years old, died at the scene. Two other occupants sustained non-life-threatening injuries.</p>
      <p>Kauai Mayor Derek Kawakami says that the entire island is mourning alongside the family and loved ones of those killed.</p>
