      <p>Éire Óg are hoping to end their long wait for a Leinster club title this year, having gone 20 years without one since their run of five in seven years in the 1990s.</p>
      <p>They faced Portlaoise in a mouthwatering semi-final clash this evening, with the Carlow side getting off to the perfect start. They would score a goal right from the throw-in, with Chris Blake providing a stunning finish to steer it on off the post.</p>
      <p>Take a look at this one.</p>

      <p>Now that's what you call a fast start!</p>
      <p>The goal is reminiscent of one scored by John Heslin for St Loman's in the Westmeath county final in 2017, one that made national headlines at the time. It's not hard to see why.</p>
