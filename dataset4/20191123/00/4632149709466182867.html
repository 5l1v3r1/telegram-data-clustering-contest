      <p>Day 2 of FiveSixZero promises to be as exciting as the inaugural day (read below). For starters, Ashish Pherwani, partner, media &amp; entertainment, Ernst &amp; Young, will deliver the keynote. Then music makers, label owners, promoters and event managers will take over, one panel after another, to talk about: ‘The evolution of underground music’, ‘The Starmakers Forum: Journey of an Artist’, ‘Effective Brand Alliances: What Works, What Doesn’t, And Why’, ‘Women In The Lead’ by the She Said So team, ‘Signing The Future’. On the sidelines of these talks, Third Party, a British progressive house DJ duo, will host a masterclass on the art of music production. <br/><br/>Plus, they have set aside a forum called Pitch Demo for you to drop your demo music and get feedback from experts at Release Recordings, Monstercat, Qilla Records, IncInk, and Armada.</p>
