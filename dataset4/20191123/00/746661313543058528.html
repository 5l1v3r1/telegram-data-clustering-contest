      <h1>First Saudi woman to race car in kingdom</h1>

      <p><b>DIRIYAH:</b> Sliding behind the wheel of a sleek electric SUV, Reema Juffali is blazing a trail in male-dominated motor sports as the first Saudi woman to race in the kingdom.</p>
      <p>Such adrenalin rushes were unimaginable for women in the ultra-conservative kingdom until June last year, when it overturned the world’s only ban on female motorists as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s wide-ranging liberalisation drive.</p>
      <p>Juffali, a 27-year-old who made her motoring debut just months after the decades-old ban ended, is competing in the Jaguar I-PACE eTROPHY, an all-electric race in Diriyah, close to the capital Riyadh.</p>
      <p>“The ban was lifted last year and I never expected to race professionally,” said Juffali, sitting in her black-and-green Jaguar I-Pace, an electric sports utility vehicle.</p>
      <p>“The fact that I am doing it… is amazing,” she said in an interview close to the racing circuit in Diriyah.</p>
      <p>Juffali, who hails from the western city of Jeddah and was educated in the United States, is participating as what organisers call a “VIP” guest driver, becoming the first Saudi woman to race on home soil.</p>
      <p>Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki al-Faisal, Saudi Arabia’s sports authority chief, has touted it as a “watershed” moment for the kingdom.</p>
      <p>“Reema will have thousands cheering her on, as a professional racing driver,” the prince said.</p>
      <p>Juffali, who made one of her first appearances in competitive racing at the F4 British Championship at Brands Hatch in April, has only about a year of professional racing experience under her belt.</p>
      <p>But she has had a passion for fast cars since her teenage years and grew up watching Formula One.</p>
      <p>She passed her driving test after she moved to the United States to study some years ago, and is now one of only a handful of Saudi woman to have obtained a “racing licence” in her home country, a mandatory requirement to race professionally.</p>
      <p>Even outside the kingdom, only a few Saudi women have raced professionally.</p>
      <p>“For a lot of women who haven’t had the opportunity to learn how to drive, to get behind the wheel is definitely something scary,” explained Juffali.</p>
      <p>“For a lot of women in Saudi Arabia it’s something so far away.”</p>
      <p>She said her dream was to one day race at Le Mans — a 24-hour competition in France that is one of the world’s most prestigious and gruelling competitions.</p>
      <p>In Riyadh she is racing against the season’s veterans but will not score any points.</p>
      <p>Prince Mohammed has sought to shake off his country’s ultra-conservative image by allowing greater freedoms for women, including easing so-called “guardianship” rules that give men authority over female relatives.</p>
      <p>But alongside reforms he has also overseen a sweeping crackdown on dissent.</p>
