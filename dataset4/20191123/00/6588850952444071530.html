      <p>The gift or calling of some Gospel artistes has been questioned and veteran Gospel singer, Cindy Thompson, has asked people not to be moved by others’ ability to sing.<br/><br/>This is because it takes more than just a good voice to be a Gospel artiste and not every one of them has been called by God. “I believe this so very much because I recall I had an event in Holland and before my performance, a choir came to sing very beautifully. "After the show, we had to go and grab something to eat and to my surprise I saw the choristers taking their robes off, pulling out cigarettes and alcohol and I was shocked.”<br/><br/>“I went to ask them if they knew what they were doing was wrong and to my amazement, they answered that they were not Christians but only singers. "Some said, they sang because they have the voice and people encouraged them to join the choir but they were not believers of the things of God or Christians.”<br/><br/>“I had another experience in Benin as well so yes it is not every Gospel artiste that is called by God,” she told <i>Graphic Showbiz.</i><br/><br/>When asked how one who has been called by God would behave and operate, the <i>Awurade Kasa</i> singer said: “Anyone who is called by God understands the ministry he or she is in.” “Whatever step one takes, one asks God for guidance; one waits for Him to speak before one acts. When one has been called by God, one does not associate with the things of this world.<br/><br/>"One is not in competition with anyone because one trusts the person who has called you,” she noted.<br/><br/>Recounting how she got into the industry, Cindy Thompson said, “I was singing in the church and people often told me how good I was. The pressure was that, I should do my song and produce an album etc but I felt that time was not right.<br/><br/>“So I went into my room and prayed, I asked God to show me a sign if indeed it’s His will and here I am today. It was so much to the extent that people actually came to me trying to poach me to their church etc.<br/><br/>“The fact that people tell you, you have a nice voice doesn’t mean you are called by God. You may have the gift which comes to everyone in different ways but God should direct you as to what you have to do with it and how to use it,” she said.<br/><br/>Cindy Thompson also touched on technology and the effect it is having on the Gospel industry.<br/><br/>“We live in a setting where everything moves at a certain speed. It is a good thing because unlike in the old days where you had to go round and give your materials out to be played, now you put it online and it’s all over.” “However, if you do not take care, you will feel you are not doing anything and you might end up forgetting your God and your calling.”<br/><br/>“Let us not forget that we are called to make an impact in this world so with every step you take, you should ask yourself if that is what you are doing.” “It is important to note that it is okay for someone to be ahead of you in life but if you have God, you can go ahead of the person and that is forever,” she said.<br/><br/>On what she has been up to, she said: “I am working, things are being done so in due time we will let it all out.”<br/><br/>Cindy Thompson ended the interview with some advice for her colleagues. “No matter what you do, wherever you find yourself, do not forget your calling.”<br/><br/>Cindy Thompson rose to fame with her hit song <i>Awurade Kasa,</i> which was used by the New Patriotic Party (NPP) in 2000 for its campaign.<br/><br/>Some of her songs include: Calvary Nyankopon, Onokwafo Nyame, Jesus Wo Nkoa and Nkunimde3.<br/>Featured Video</p>
