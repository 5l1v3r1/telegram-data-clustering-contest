        <b>DIRECTOR of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Paula Llewellyn yesterday urged a panel of seven jurors to rely on the evidence given by the witness in the chopping, shooting and beheading of a St Catherine mother and her daughter in 2011.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kemar Riley, who is charged with two counts of murder, is the only remaining accused in the trial after his co-accused, former assistant teacher Sanja Ducally was freed on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>During her closing arguments in the Home Circuit Court yesterday, Llewellyn, who told the court that it was one of the worst cases she had dealt with in her more than 30-year career, said the board dwelling Charmaine Rattray and her daughter Joeith Lynch shared before they were executed between the night of July 19th and the morning of the 20th was not only turned in a bloodbath but a butcher shop.</p>
      <p>“That night there was no tea party going on… It was butchering and more butchering,” Llewellyn said as photos of the aftermath were on display in the courtroom.</p>
      <p>Facing the jury, which comprises three men and four women, Llewellyn said Rattray and her 18-year-old daughter, “were like lamb to the slaughter, slaughter; in a true definition of the word”.</p>
      <p>Stressing that the women did not deserve what they got, the prosecutor told the jurors, who are expected to deliberate on Monday, not to abandon their common sense.</p>
      <p>“It was a wicked act, and he has to be called out on it,” the DPP said.</p>
      <p>“Death is the surest thing after birth, but to die in this way is like a goat being butchered, and like a cow being polled for nothing at all,” she continued.</p>
      <p>Emphasising that they should rely on the evidence given by the witness, the DPP pointed out that the community is a neighbourhood where everybody knows everybody.</p>
      <p>“The nature of the killing was to send a message to the community,” the DPP said, adding that the community conspiracy, “See no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil” was evident when the inspector in the matter said the residents were tight-lipped and that they had to make arrangements to speak with them outside of the community.</p>
      <p>Stating that Kemar Riley felt comfortable in the system so much so that he slept at his home on the night of the incident, the prosecutor said luckily the witness was a stranger to the community and that he worked outside the neighbourhood as well.</p>
      <p>The DPP said she found it interesting when she asked him when was the first time he heard about the butchering, his reply was: “Di people seh some people dead down di road.”</p>
      <p>She added that, surprisingly, he never asked who they were, but instead he took up his tool bag with his tools and pedalled in the opposite direction of the crime scene.</p>
      <p>She also argued that there was no curiosity on his part to find out who had been killed because he already knew who they were.</p>
      <p>Submitting to the panel of jurors that there is no perfect crime, the prosecutor said he had eight years to mount his defence.</p>
      <p>“If you had done something wrong you must prepare to bear the consequences,” the prosecutor said.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the trial, the witness said Riley told him that the mother and daughter duo, “…programme dem Labourite family fi come kill Scott, so dem move in back on the mother and the daughter”.</p>
      <p>However, the prosecutor told the jurors yesterday that the case is not about politics and that it should not be used against the accused man or the deceased.</p>
      <p>“No human being deserves to die in such a manner,” the prosecutor said as she urged the jurors not to allow Riley to get away with murder.</p>
