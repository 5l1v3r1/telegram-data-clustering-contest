      <p>When a founder leaves a company there is a looming question mark about whether there is someone who will be able to carry the legacy of the company. In mid-September, it was announced that Jack Ma would be leaving Alibaba, a company whose success is closely linked to his leadership. Ma wasn’t only the founder, he came with a unique personality that made him seem indelible to Alibaba. To close out his tenure as head of the company, he celebrated by wearing a rockstar wig and guitar for the company event. </p>
      <p>The reason for his retirement, as Reuters reported, is he was looking for new opportunity: “After tonight I will start a new life. I do believe the world is good, there are so many opportunities, and I love excitement so much, which is why I will retire early,” Ma told guests and employees.”</p>
      <p>And that new opportunity appears to be helping to support the growth of e-commerce business in Africa. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-15/jack-ma-sees-virgin-land-in-africa-for-e-commerce-entrepreneurs">According to Bloomberg</a>, Ma suggested notable opportunity in e-commerce, logistics, and e-payments, all areas in which he can bring not only money but expertise.</p>

        <b>Why Ma Is Right For The “Job”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alibaba seems to have only been Ma’s first act. And his ability to walk away from a company like Alibaba, is a testament to how strongly he believes in this next one. But in many ways a second act is more challenging than the first—the bar has been set very high and expectations can often be untenable. </p>
      <p>“It is not easy to be a strong company, but it is more difficult to be a good company...A strong company is determined by its commercial ability, while a good company is responsible and kind,” Ma <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alibaba-jackma-idUSKCN1VU0VY">said</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In his first go-around, Ma succeeded in building a strong company. Despite economic challenges stemming from the trade wars between the US and China and threats of increasing regulation on technology companies, Alibaba seems to have emerged unscathed. It’s quarterly earnings report released this August showed signs of a growth both in membership, revenue, and net profit. </p>
      <p>Alibaba is a company that has revolutionized China in a way even more profound than Amazon has transformed the US. It tapped into a demographic that had the means and the desire for greater purchasing options, at unprecedented scale. </p>
      <p>Ma is often held up as exemplar of perseverance. Given Ma’s history of overcoming obstacles, he may be the right person to tackle the business challenges he has chosen as his encore career. Looking back, Ma has stated that in retrospect he isn’t proud of his successes, like the founding of Alibaba, but instead of persevering through the challenges that led to his successes. </p>
      <p>And it is this perseverance that will serve him well as he takes on the difficult task of focusing on developing both commercially-sound and responsible businesses in economically-challenged markets in Africa. </p>
      <p>
        <b>A Legacy Of Perseverance</b>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps Ma’s greatest legacy is his story of perseverance. </p>
      <p>Ma grew up China with very little in terms of material riches. But what he lacked in money he seemed to make up for in determination. The start of his adult life was a rocky ride. He failed his university entrance exams twice, finally succeeding the third time around. After graduation, he applied for dozens of jobs, getting rejected from them all. Ma eventually got hired as an English teacher.</p>
      <p>While Ma loved teaching, the pay was poor, and he also had a hunger to start a business. In his off-hours he began a translation business. That business, along with another both failed. And it was only half a decade later, that he decided to start Alibaba with a few friends. </p>
      <p>But even then it wasn’t an obvious success. In its early stages, Ma had sought out funding from venture capital in the US and was facing constant rejection. Eventually, the company garnered $25 million in investments, including from the venture capital giant, Softbank. Five years later, in 2005, it received an investment from Yahoo, which soon catapulted the company to become a tech giant. </p>
      <p>But like any journey, it still took a circuitous path, as the company continued to face challenges, especially in 2009, when the company severely suffered after the financial crisis. Ten years ago, the idea of retirement had already been planted in Ma’s mind, but he decided to stay on to see the company through the challenging period. </p>
      <p>Ma’s legacy isn’t just Alibaba; it’s his story of perpetually renewed perseverance required to create such a transformative company.</p>
      <p>Even then, though, the story of perseverance gets distorted. It isn’t perseverance at all costs; it’s perseverance rooted in the pursuit of fun. An early photo of Jack Ma laughing with his earliest Alibaba employees is emblematic of this childlike quality. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Persevering not because it’s painful—an especially popular narrative in the American workforce—but because it is fun. Ma’s ethos—that pursuit of joy and fun—is perhaps his most distinctive quality, and the one that will drive his future success. </p>
      <p>And as someone who has been following Ma for some time and have always found inspiration in his story, I hope his next journey will continue to spotlight his unique approach to both business and life. </p>
      <p>If Alibaba is indicative at all of Ma’s legacy, it isn’t so much about the company he built but the way in which he built it that will inspire others to do the same, a premise that has never been far from his mind. “Young people will have the seeds you bury in their minds and when they grow up they will change the world.”</p>
