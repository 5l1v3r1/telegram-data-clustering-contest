      <p><b>REVIEW OF THE DAY -</b> Holders Brazil got their FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup Paraguay 2019â„¢ campaign off to an expectedly-smooth start by dispatching of Oman 8-2. Earlier in the day, Brazil's Group D competitors, and likely their toughest challengers in the section, Portugal, scored ten goals against the Super Sand Eagles of Nigeria.</p>
      <p>In Group C, Russia edged Senegal in a thrilling, back-and-forth battle between two regional championsâ€”easily the day's closest contest. The tournament's sole debutants Belarus looked like seasoned veterans in their comfortable win over the United Arab Emirates.</p>

      <h4>Moments of the day ðŸ“Œ</h4>
      <p><i>Historic goal</i><br/>Not many people in the world can say they scored their country's first ever goal in a World Cup, but now Illia Savich is one of those people. The defender poked in the opening goal in Belarus' win over the United Arab Emirates in Group C. It was a scrappy one, but he simply won't care. Belarus' Beach Soccer World Cup story has its first chapter written.</p>

      <p><i>Mauricinho's milestone</i><br/>Brazil forward Mauricinho celebrated his 100th appearance with the Brazilian national team in style by scoring three goals against Oman in their lopsided victory in Group D. One of the most respected and decorated players in beach soccer, Mauricinho scored a goal in each period to put <i>Canarinha</i>'s victory beyond doubt and to remind the participating teams, of which there were many in attendance inside the stadium, that it will be far from easy to succeed the throne.</p>

      <p><i>Monkey off Madjer's back</i><br/>There was a special moment at the very conclusion of Portugal's ten-goal haul this evening. Living beach soccer legend Madjer scored the game's final goal. The competition's all-time leading scorer (by some distance), now at 88 goals, failed to register a single goal at the last edition of the Beach Soccer World Cup at Bahamas 2017 oddly enough. He will be mightily relieved to have scored in Portugal's first match at Paraguay 2019, to not only help his team to victory, but also to add to his growing legacy in the game. Another aspect worth noting from that goal was that the youngest player on Portugal's squad, 19-year-old Ruben Brilhante, provided the assist for someone more than twice his age and the team's eldest, 42-year-old Madjer.</p>

      <h4>What's next ðŸ—“</h4>
      <p>
        <i>Matchday 3 - 23 November</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>Group A</i><br/><b><a href="https://www.fifa.com/beachsoccerworldcup/matches/match/400095721/#match-squadlist">USA v Japan</a></b> <i>(17:50 local time)</i><br/><b><a href="https://www.fifa.com/beachsoccerworldcup/matches/match/400095722/#match-squadlist">Paraguay v Switzerland</a></b> <i>(21:00 local time)</i></p>

      <p>This is the portion of the competition that gets fans' brains turning more and more towards the group standings to see what their teams need to do to be on the right track towards knockout-stage qualification.</p>
      <p>The matchday will open with a game featuring two teams that will be eager to get their first points on the board in Tahiti and Mexico, following opening defeats by Italy and Uruguay respectively. Those two will meet later in the night for the chance to distance themselves from the rest of Group B.</p>
      <p>Japan will have the slight edge on USA in their Group A contest with the Stars and Stripes needing to get back on their feet after losing to Switzerland, while Japan are looking to build on their dramatic late win over Paraguay. The match-up between Nick Perera and Ozu Moreira will be one to watch. The hosts will round out the day with a crucial meeting with Switzerland in front of what is expected be a full home support at <i>Los Pynandi</i> Stadium.</p>
