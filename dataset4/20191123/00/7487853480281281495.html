      <h1>Mauricio Pochettino Is the Perfect Candidate for Bayern Munich - And Must Be Appointed Immediately</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15402033" target="_blank">Charlie Adey</a></address>
      <p>​As I'm sure <i>literally</i> everyone is aware by now, Mauricio Pochettino was sacked by Tottenham Hotspur and replaced by the self-proclaimed 'Special One' José Mourinho 11 hours later. </p>
      <p>Football can be a cruel game. It is war minus the shooting, as George Orwell once uttered, and Pochettino will still be feeling the shock of his dismissal after a poor start to the 2019/20 campaign. </p>
      <p>At the time of his expulsion from the club, Tottenham sat in 14th place in the Premier League and had experienced embarrassing defeats at the hands of Colchester in the Carabao Cup, Brighton in the Premier League and Bayern Munich (who we will come to in a minute) in the Champions League.</p>

      <p>They had also only won three times in the league this season; against Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and Pochettino's former side, Southampton. </p>
      <p>Change was therefore necessary.</p>
      <p>So where next for a manager who took charge of more (202) <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">Premier League</a> games than any other Tottenham Hotspur manager? Well, quite possibly, to the aforementioned Bayern Munich - who could definitely do with his TLC at this moment in time.</p>
      <p>The Bavarian club have flirted with the idea of Pochettino joining them previously, with <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6009572-mauricio-pochettino-contacted-by-bayern-munich-as-hunt-for-new-coach-continues">interest in the Argentine</a> dating back to March 2018. And it is obvious to see why. He oozes class, loyalty and more importantly, embodies longevity at a club.</p>
      <p>That is one thing that Bayern have failed to sustain ever since Pep Guardiola announced in February 2016 that he was departing for pastures new at Manchester City. Carlo Ancelotti came and went by September 2017, and since then we've seen Jupp Heynckes and Niko Kovač take the reins.</p>

      <p>Heynckes was always going to be a short-term appointment, but there were high hopes for Kovač - his employment not panning out in the way many thought it would. Now it's Hansi Flick in temporary charge, but that's all it is - temporary.</p>
      <p>If there is one thing Pochettino will offer Bayern, it's longevity. </p>
      <p>The former Espanyol manager spent five years at <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/tottenham">​Spurs</a> and delivered unrivalled success, transforming the Lilywhites from a European hopeful to one that mounted two title challenges in 2015/16 and 2016/17 and improbably reached the 2018/19 Champions League final. Bayern are in desperate need of a young, positive coach who can help develop the crop of players at the Allianz Arena; Pochettino ticks all of those boxes.</p>
      <p>Tactically, Pochettino would be a natural fit for <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/bayern">​Bayern</a>. The 47-year-old has a playing philosophy that supersedes systems, meaning his set-up will depend on the players at his disposal or the opposition he is facing. </p>
      <p>This will be an attractive attribute to new Bayern chairman Herbert Hainer, as Pochettino will work around his players, and not the other way around. Pochettino likes to play with advanced full-backs and convert wingers into inside forwards, something which will the suit the playing style of players such as David Alaba, Serge Gnabry and Ivan Perišić. </p>

      <p>Vertical positional play in the final third is another hallmark of Pochettino's sides, which will suit more creative players such as Philippe Coutinho, who coincidentally worked alongside the outgoing Spurs boss at Espanyol.</p>
      <p>Another reason why Pochettino is the best manager available for Bayern Munich is his ability to develop teams on a small budget. Despite a strong financial performance from Bayern in the 2018/19 season, the German champions seldom splash huge figures in the transfer market, something which CEO Oliver Kahn is keen to continue. </p>
      <p>Pochettino has proven he is able to develop and nurture sides on modest budgets, at Espanyol and Southampton, and there's no reason to doubt why he couldn't do the same at Bayern, especially as their will be a huge gulf in class between the players inherited.</p>
      <p>Similarly, Pochettino has built a reputation as someone who integrates youth players into the first team, doing so firstly at Espanyol in the 2007/08 season, fielding six youth academy graduates in his starting XI in a 2-1 victory over Sevilla. </p>
      <p>In the 2013/14 season at <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/southampton">​Southampton</a>, Pochettino guided the Saints to an 8th placed finish and did so whilst utilising academy graduates Luke Shaw, Calum Chambers, James Ward-Prowse and Adam Lallana. </p>

        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fsunderland-v-southampton-premier-league-5ddae5938a147a30ab000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.9739682539682539&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=0.9471428571428572&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.026442577030812323&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.05142857142857143&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Bayern may, therefore, see Pochettino as the perfect manager to get the best out of developing players like Alphonso Davies, Lars Lukas Mai, Franck Evina, Fiete Arp and Chris Richards - all of whom are knocking on the door for first team recognition.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Pochettino is the ideal manager to oversee a club in transition from a financial standpoint. The ex-Paris Saint Germain midfielder left Southampton in a positive financial position in 2014, increasing the value of some of the clubs assets prior to them being sold. Luke Shaw eventually joined <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-united">​Manchester United</a> for £30m, Calum Chambers earned the Saints £16m when he joined <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/arsenal">​Arsenal</a> and Adam Lallana joined <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/liverpool">​Liverpool</a> for a fee of £25m. </p>
      <p>At Spurs, Pochettino transformed the north London club into regular Champions League participants, a feat which would have been seemingly impossible in the years prior to his appointment. </p>
      <p>Bayern are a club in transition, players such as Arjen Robben, Frank Ribery and Rafinha all departed after long spells at the Allianz, while Mats Hummels re-joined <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/dortmund">​Borussia Dortmund</a> in the summer. Moreover, structural changes to the board saw Uli Hoeneß step down as president, replaced by Hainer, meaning a period of stability is needed at the helm.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Pochettino's successes at Espanyol, Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur have boosted his reputation and is therefore he is not <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6501458-barcelona-leading-bayern-munich-real-madrid-man-utd-in-race-for-mauricio-pochettino">​short of potential suitors</a>. </p>
      <p>However, joining Bayern seems like the natural step in the Argentine's career and he is almost certainly the best option available for a Munich side who need to be managed properly over the next four years. The aim of Die Roten is clear - return to the top of European football and in Pochettino, they may have the man who could grant their wish.</p>
