      <h1>Allegations of torture at Nithyanand's Ahmedabad Ashram</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Deepal Trivedi</a></address>
      <p>The Nithyanand controversy in Gujarat could put the BJP government in a spot after a prima facie police investigation revealed that the self-styled godman’s ashram, within the premises of the elite DPS School in Ahmedabad’s outskirts, wasn’t being monitored by the State Education Department. “The claims of the Education Department that the ashram did not come under its purview as the school is affiliated to the CBSE school is not the right approach,” a senior police officer told Mirror. <br/><br/>Nithyanand was booked for alleged child abuse and kidnapping by the Gujarat Police on Tuesday after minor children were rescued from his ashram. This is the second case filed against him, in addition to the rape case filed in 2010. Two of his disciples, Pranpriya and Priyatatva, were arrested on Tuesday on charges of kidnapping, assault, and illegal confinement and remanded in police custody for five days. Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has announced an inquiry into the issue.</p>
      <p>I think I met him more than a year ago for a few minutes when I went to his ashram during elections ... We meet many god-men. They are also a part of our constituency</p>
      <p>-D K Shivakumar<br/><br/>Credit for exposing the scam also goes to the BJP only because the Child Rights Commission chairperson, Jagruti Haren Pandya, was the first to raise the red flag against the goings-on in the ashram. Aggrieved parents Janardhana Sharma and his wife Umeshwari had approached Jagruti, alleging that four of their children in the ashram had gone incommunicado. They told her that the ashram authorities had thrown them out when they tried to meet their children. <br/><br/>Jagruti asked the parents to put a complaint in writing which the parents feared to do due to “dire consequences”. They told her they were scared that Nithyanand and his followers would kill them if they came out openly. However, within 48 hours, not only did Jagruti help them file a written application to her department, but also assisted them in filing the police complaint. The Ahmedabad Police acted swiftly but even when they reached the spot, Nithyanand’s disciples, who call themselves yoginis of the ashram, made the police wait at least two hours before letting them in. <br/><br/>Inside, when the search was conducted, the police found that the yoginis had locked away all the computers and tablets and deleted all history. They refused to share passwords and there was no tangible digital history present on the gadgets. “This has been done in such a manner that even the forensic science laboratory has not been able to crack a single of the 33 tablets and computers we seized,” an official from the laboratory told Mirror.</p>

      <p>Mirror, which first broke the Nithyanand ashram mess story, can report that there are at least 37 minors in the ashram whom the Child Welfare Committee of Gujarat government is speaking to. Two minors, who were the first the police spoke to, complained of favouritism and some “abnormal” ashram rules, and cried to be released. <br/><br/>These two were siblings and handed over to their father Janardhana who lives in Bangalore. A senior BJP minister in Gujarat told Mirror that a detailed report on Nithyanand’s ashram will be submitted by the Child Welfare Committee next week and it is after this report that action will be initiated. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, two adult siblings, Taatvapriya alias Lopamudra, 21, and 18-year-old Nithyananandita, who are also daughters of Janardhana Sharma, have not only claimed allegiance to Nithyanand, but have also stressed that their father was a “big fraudster”. “Swamiji was a father not just to us four siblings but even to our parents. However, Janardhana is a fraud and he was trying to use me as a weapon to defame Swamiji. This is not our family issue, but a public issue. Janardhana wanted us to file a fake rape complaint against Swamiji but now we are here,” the sisters said in a Facebook video. <br/><br/>They refused to disclose their location, but both the sisters are believed to be either in Trinidad or in India itself. The Ahmedabad cyber cell is trying to locate them but had not been successful till the time of going to press. The two women said they were adults, happy with their lives and do not want to return to their biological parents. Top sources acquainted with the functioning of Nithyananda’s ashram in Bangalore told Mirror that “work is on to reveal the fraud conducted by Janardhana Sharma at the ashram in Bangalore”. “Janardhana has been removed from the ashram. Hence, he hatched this conspiracy to show Swami Nithyananda and the BJP government in Gujarat in poor light,” the sources said.</p>
