      <p>The unlikely duo of Stephen Curry and Will Arnett will collaborate as executive producers to develop an NBA-themed comedy series at Fox entitled <i>The Second Half</i>. The planned multi-camera sitcom will provide a “humorous look” at life after the NBA for a retired basketball player who returns home to Charlotte, purchases a car wash and labors to rekindle his relationships with family and friends.</p>
      <p>Charlotte is Curry’s hometown via the ten seasons his father Dell played for the Hornets (1988-98) before finishing the final four years of his career in Milwaukee and Toronto.</p>
      <p>Curry, 31, is a three-time NBA champion shooting guard with the Golden State Warriors who is currently rehabilitating from a broken hand he sustained on the court in late-October.</p>
      <p>Like league contemporaries Dwayne Wade (59th &amp; Prairie Entertainment) and Lebron James (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4481322/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_3">SpringHill Entertainment</a>) before him, Curry entered the film and TV production hustle in April 2018 under his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/unanimousmedia">Unanimous Media</a> studio banner.</p>
      <p>A planned co-production between Fox Entertainment and Sony Pictures TV–who each have separate overall deals with Arnett and Curry’s respective studios–Fox on Thursday gave the series an official script order and penalty commitment.</p>
      <p><i>Workaholics</i> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4481322/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_3"><i>The Grinder</i></a> writer <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3584289/">Sean Clements</a> will write the pilot and executive produce alongside Arnett and Curry.</p>
      <p><i>The Second Half</i> builds on Arnett’s cozy relationship with the Fox network that dates back to the early-2000s when the comedic actor made a splash as Gob Bluth in the critically-acclaimed cult-comedy<i> Arrested Development</i>.</p>
      <p>The toast of the animated comedy world since 2014 voicing the eponymous lead in Netflix’s <i>Bojack Horseman</i>, Arnett will host the upcoming Fox competition series <i>Lego Masters</i> beginning in February 2020. The new gig serves as a partial nod to his service voicing Bruce Wayne/Batman in the ongoing “Lego Movie” franchise (2015-present).</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Curry–already ten seasons deep into an illustrious NBA career–is ostensibly foreshadowing his post-basketball future by getting increasingly involved in the entertainment sphere.</p>
      <p>Curry over the summer executive produced and hosted the ABC sports reality competition series <i>Holey Moley–</i>a ten-episode run that featured contestants going head-to-head on a zany miniature golf course.</p>
      <p>Upcoming projects for the future Hall of Famer as executive producer include a YouTube series (<i>5 Minutes From Home</i>) and a documentary about the 2015 Charleston Church shooting entitled <i>Emanuel</i>.</p>
      <p>In April Curry’s Unanimous Media released their debut feature, <i>Breakthrough. </i>Based on the novel <i>Impossible</i> by Joyce Smith, the film told the true story of how the author’s son was revived from the dead with the power of prayer after falling through a frozen pond.</p>
      <p>Curry is an outspoken Christian who sports tattoos of biblical verses and commonly pounds his chest and points to the sky during games in tribute to God. While <i>The Second Half</i> figures to straddle a more secular line for network TV purposes, Curry has stated his desire to use Unanimous Media as a means of highlighting faith-based projects.</p>
