      <h1>Santosh Lad still got to pay back Rs 7.25 crore loan</h1>

      <p><i>HC has also dismissed Rockline Venkatesh’s appeal to double the payout</i> <br/><br/>The High Court has dismissed the revision petitions of both politician Santosh S Lad and film maker Rockline Venkatesh, paving the way for the former to pay back Rs 7.25 crore to the latter. The dispute dates back to 2014 and involves a payment dispute over Kochadaiiyaan, the film starring Rajinikanth. <br/><br/>The original money transaction was between M/s Media One Global Entertainment Ltd and M/s Sheetal Developers. Media One is said to have approached Rockline Entertainment Pvt Ltd for a loan of Rs 6 crore to clear its dues to Sheetal Developers. Santosh Lad is said to have stood guarantee for the loan. <br/><br/>Lad is said to have issued 10 cheques to discharge his liability and an agreement was also entered into in November 2014. Three of the cheques were taken back by the accused while the rest of them were dishonoured for insufficient funds in the account. <br/><br/>The matter reached HC with petitions by both parties. The petition by Rockline Entertainment sought “enhancement of fine amount to double the cheque amount.” The HC dismissed the petitions of both the parties, thereby upholding the orders of the lower court. It said, “It is well settled proposition of law that revisional court is having only limited jurisdiction and it can only interfere in case of apparent error being occurred on the face of the records or if any illegality has been committed by the Trial Court or first Appellate Court. No such case is made out by both the parties.”</p>
