      <p>You know that <i>Escherichia coli</i> O157:H7 outbreak that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/11/21/e-coli-outbreak-hits-8-states-chicken-caesar-salad-may-be-the-culprit/#4a92232a6c4d">I reported on for <i>Forbes</i> this past Thursday</a>? Well, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2019/o157h7-11-19/index.html">the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has just lettuce</a> know some more information. And the message has certainly not “romained” the same. It was originally thought that this outbreak was just a fail Caesar situation, that only a specific lot of Ready Pac Foods Bistro<sup>®</sup> Chicken Caesar Salads was associated with the outbreak. But that belief was so yesterday. Instead, unfortunately the contamination now appears to be much, much broader. It’s no longer confined to just one brand of salad, or even just salad. No, the salad days are over, and the latest CDC warning covers much more as you can see here:</p>
      <p>Here we go again with yet another outbreak. The song romaines the same, 2019 meet 2018 and 2017. For the third straight year, there is a romaine-associated <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 outbreak in North America. As you can see, the CDC’s advice is now to avoid <i>any</i> romaine lettuce from the Salinas, California, growing region. That’s none, nicht, nadda romaine from that part of the country. Do not sell, serve, eat, or wrap yourself in romaine lettuce that could possibly have been grown in Salinas. That includes hearts, heads, spears, or any other form of romaine lettuce, whether it’s in a salad, in a wrap, by itself, uncooked, sauteed, grilled, buttered, smothered in gravy, shaped in a sculpture of Matthew McConaughey, or chilled. If you are about to eat romaine lettuce, check, check, check from where it has originated.</p>
      <p>As I mentioned previously, an <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 outbreak is pretty serious stuff, not to be taken lightly. Infections can result in life-threatening complications, especially in young kids, older adults, and anyone with a weakened immune system. Since my previous report, the size of the outbreak has jumped from 17 reported cases to 40, and twice as many states (16 versus eight) are now involved. There have also been four-times as many hospitalizations (28 up from seven). That’s quite a jump from two days ago.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, no one seems to have died from the outbreak so far. However, five people have already developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) from infections. While infection most often causes 4 to 7 days of diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps, some (between 2% and 15%) infections progress to HUS. This occurs when the Shiga toxin secreted by the bacteria messes with the blood vessels in your kidneys, leading to kidney failure. As you can imagine, kidney failure is a bad thing to have and can lead to death.</p>
      <p>So toss your romaine if it’s from Salinas, before you toss your cookies or more, much more. Trying romaine lettuce that may be contaminated isn’t just playing diarrhea roulette, it’s playing major health risk roulette. And if you got your romaine from the Missa Bay, LLC., supplier ask for a refund. <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2019/recall-115-2019-release">According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)</a>, the company has issued a recall of approximately 75,233 pounds of its salad products due to concerns about <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7, contamination. Check to see if your salad products were produced from October 14 to October 16, 2019, and bear the establishment number “EST. 18502B.” These products went to a wide range of states, including Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin. That’s a poop-load of states.</p>
      <p>If the romaine lettuce industry was hoping to recover from the 2017-2018 <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 outbreaks, this is certainly not the way to do it. Some in the twitterverse are now questioning the presence of romaine in their diets or in general:</p>
      <p>At the very least, with Thanksgiving approaching, you may want to alter your Holiday meal plans:</p>
      <p>OK, many pies don’t exactly qualify as healthy food items but presumably they won’t be bad bacteria bombs.</p>
      <p>If you can’t quite tell where your romaine lettuce originated, this isn’t the time to play the “mystery lettuce” game. It’s better to be safe than sorry. Return the lettuce or at least dispose of it in a place that’s safe and far away from anyone’s mouth. Also, throw away or thoroughly clean anything that may have touched the lettuce.</p>
      <p>This latest outbreak raises a bigger question. In the words of Marvin Gaye, “what going on” with romaine lettuce? <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2018/04/13/cdc-it-is-romaine-lettuce-thats-likely-to-blame-for-ecoli-outbreak/#10439fec7e98">My Forbes article from April 2018</a> covered the romaine-associated <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 outbreaks from late 2017, early 2018 and the Spring of 2018. Then, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2018/11/22/do-not-eat-any-romaine-lettuce-cdc-warns-of-another-e-coli-outbreak/#41f68e3d32e6">in November 2018</a>, I wrote about yet another such outbreak. That’s at least three significant outbreaks in less than three years. Something ain’t right.</p>
      <p>It’s time to take a closer look at how romaine is being grown, harvested, processed, and delivered and how each of these are being regulated and monitored. There has been some speculation in the twittersphere, because what would Twitter be without speculation, such as this thought offered by @kategammon:</p>
      <p>This may be the case but why then have there been seemingly more outbreaks in recent years? Romaine lettuce isn’t like avocado toast. It’s not as if was just discovered in recent years or even recent decades.</p>
      <p>In fact,<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/11/01/10th-salmonella-outbreak-of-2019-this-time-it-is-ground-beef/"> as I have written over and over again</a>, the past two years have seen a surge in reported food-borne infectious disease outbreaks in general. In July of this year <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/02/enforcement-food-drug-safety-regulations-trump">Emily Holden wrote an article for <i>The Guardian</i> entitled</a>, “Enforcement of food and drug safety regulations nosedives under Trump,” with Trump referring to U.S. President Donald Trump, in case you haven’t heard of him. Could relaxation of food safety standards then be the reason why we have been seeing more food-borne outbreaks since Trump assumed office in 2017?</p>
      <p>This situation with food ain’t good. Can we really afford to leave be what’s been happening to romaine as well as numerous other food products? Food-borne outbreaks not only are costly but can pose significant harm to and even kill people. As they say, once may be an accident, twice may still be a coincidence, but three times is a trend.  </p>
