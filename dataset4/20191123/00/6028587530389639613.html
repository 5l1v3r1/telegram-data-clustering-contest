      <p>I bought a copy of <i>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</i> from Google so I could compare the game on Stadia, Xbox One X and xCloud. It’s a great game that I’ve enjoyed playing but I wasn’t happy to spend $60 on a game I already own or having to start all over from the beginning. Earlier I had discovered <i>Battle Chasers: Nightwar</i> when I was sampling games in the xCloud beta. I enjoyed it so much I wanted to buy it for my console but discovered it was free to download through Game Pass. When I launched the console version it continued where I left off on xCloud.</p>
      <p>So, $60 I didn’t want to spend on a game I already had vs. $0 for a game I didn’t own and wanted to buy. Starting from the beginning vs. starting from where I left off.</p>
      <p>Advantage xCloud.</p>
