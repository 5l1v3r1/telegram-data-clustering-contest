        <b>President Yoweri Museveni has commended two American investors — Glenn Camp, the co-chairperson and co-CEO of Sustainable Communities Holdings and Austin McDonald, the president of Genezen Energy — for creating jobs and engaging in environmentally friendly projects for ordinary Ugandans.</b>

      <p>Sustainable Community Holdings is setting up a factory in Budaka, eastern Uganda to manufacture building panels from agricultural waste products, such as rice straws, while Genezen Energy has been given 50 acres of land by Iki-Iki sub-county in Budaka to set up a factory to manufacture solar panels and recyclable LED silicate solar batteries, which are safer than lithium ones.</p>

      <p>“There are benefits from such investments, such as creating jobs and conserving the environment. This will stop people from cutting down trees to get building materials and will also lower the cost of building materials,” Museveni said, adding that the government will fully support the projects.</p>

      <p>Museveni said the project, once it kicks off, will benefit both government low-tier workers and ordinary Ugandans to access quality housing. “This will help our government workers, such as teachers, police, army, and members of the public to access decent housing. We can support them, especially with installment payments. The government will co-invest in this factory in order to lower the cost of building materials,” he said.</p>
