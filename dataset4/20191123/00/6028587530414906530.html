      <p>Natasha Sumant was working as a freelance art director in New York when she started exploring South Asian feminism.“I found that there was a hole in the market and nothing was really speaking to us,” Sumant, who is 28, tells Forbes.</p>
      <p>Gundi is a Hindi expression used for women who aren’t considered ladylike - or for female thugs. </p>
      <p>“Gundi Studios is a progressive brand that celebrates outspoken South Asian womxn in motherland and diaspora,” Sumant explains. “Gundi is the Hindi word for female-thug or gangsta, a colloquialism used to describe girls who misbehave. The brand was founded in response to the lack of representation in media of assertive and independent South Asian women.”</p>
      <p>Sumant had designed a piece of typography reading “Gundi” and had embroidered it onto a patch, and featured the patch on fashion shoots, which gained traction on social media.</p>
      <p>“They really resonated with people, so I started selling the patches to others to pin onto their clothing and claim the word Gundi for themselves too.</p>
      <p>“I started buying up vintage jackets and selling those with the patches pre-pinned. When I realized that people preferred buying the jackets over the patches alone, I decided to launch a collection that would enable people to wear their values. I moved back to India in 2018 to design our first collection, and build out our supply chain.”</p>
      <p>The website was launched earlier this year.</p>

      <p><a href="https://gundistudios.com/">Gundi Studio</a>s’ products are handmade in India, and clothes are produced in small batches. Sumant’s hope is to turn the fast fashion industry on its head, by not just producing clothing, but also running a media outlet on the brand’s site - which includes producing short narrative films.</p>
      <p>“Our streetwear is created in a women-led supply chain, and our media addresses issues related to gender and postcolonialism. Women are often victims of the fast fashion industry on both the demand and supply side—advertising regularly plays off female insecurities to generate demand for products made by disenfranchised (and often female and South-Asian) garment workers.</p>
      <p>“Our clothes are made to last by a small and dedicated team of artisans, embroiderers and tailors based in India.”</p>
      <p>The studio uses aari, zari and cut dana techniques which are traditionally used on sarees and burkhas, but brings them into the modern day with streetwear-inspired styles.</p>
      <p>Sumant said her company’s target audience is similar to that of NorblackNorWhite and Brother Vellies, who both merge design with sustainability and traditional techniques. “But we talk to the South Asian market in a way that is very different to others,” she adds. “Our campaigns and content speak to a market of underground South Asian diaspora. We make streetwear that takes sustainability, and traditional craft techniques into consideration and our supply chain is womxn led and womxn run.”</p>
      <p>Sumant’s biggest challenge has been creating an ethical supply chain and employing South Asian women at “every level” of the business.</p>
      <p>She says there are “real systemic problems” within the garment industry in India and while it’s quite easy to find a factory that will make anything for you, it is hard to find ethical spaces.</p>
      <p>“In India, on the factory floor womxn often occupy lower positions of hand embroidering, hand sewing or using machines. Pattern cutters are almost always men. Embroiderers that can do our signature zari embroidery work are almost always men, so it was a challenge finding skilled women who could execute our designs.”</p>
      <p>The types of embroidery the company uses require long stretches of uninterrupted time, which Sumant says explains why it is often the domain of male artists who have fewer responsibilities at home, and therefore more time to invest.</p>
      <p>After dedicating most of 2019 to finding ethical partners, Sumant can now say her supply chain is “100% womxn led and womxn run”.</p>
      <p>The collection and feminist artwork has already hit Mumbai, New York and London, and going forward Sumant hopes to continue growing her audience.</p>
      <p>“We’d like to get more of our pieces into consumer’s hands so that we can provide the women working at our production partners with as much meaningful work as possible.</p>
      <p>“We’re also going to keep making work that uses eastern craft techniques and recontextualises South Asian art forms into genres and styles that can be seen across fashion and not just the “ethnic” section of Anthropologie stores and Free People.”</p>
