        <b>PSG manager, Thomas Tuchel, analysed the 60 minutes Neymar got after his return from injury in the match against Lille.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Neymar started again for PSG against Lille after a month and a half out. The Brazilian was grey, but his manager said that <b>he didn't expect much more</b> after being out for so long.</p>
      <p>"No, I'm not worried about his performance. I don't know if it's normal, but at the same time,<b> I didn't expect much from him because he's missed six weeks</b>. It's a lot for a player like him", Tuchel explained.</p>

      <p><b>"Ney needs rhythm, to play, time to dribble and to be decisive</b>. This time it wasn't like that", the manager added.</p>
      <p>For Tuchel, Neymar still needs to recover sensations:Â "He has lacked rhythm, precision and time to make decisive pieces of play. But after six weeks,<b> he had to play for a few minutes</b>. And he played 60".</p>
