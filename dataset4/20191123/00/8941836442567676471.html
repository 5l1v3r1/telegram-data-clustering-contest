      <p>AUBURN, Ala. (AP) - Auburn police have arrested a second man in the disappearance of a UFC heavyweight fighter’s stepdaughter.</p>
      <p>Lee County District Attorney Brandon Hughes told The Associated Press by email Saturday that 35-year-old Antwain Shamar Fisher of Montgomery has been charged with first-degree kidnapping in the disappearance last month of 19-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aniah-blanchard/">Aniah Blanchard</a>.</p>
      <p>He told the Opelika-Auburn News and WRBL-TV that Fisher was arrested Friday and booked Saturday into the Lee County Jail.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aniah-blanchard/">Blanchard</a> was last seen Oct. 23 in Auburn. Her stepfather is UFC participant Walt Harris of metro Birmingham.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, a Lee County judge ordered 29-year-old Ibraheem Yazeed to submit a DNA sample after prosecutors said a male’s DNA was found in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aniah-blanchard/">Blanchard</a>’s car.</p>
