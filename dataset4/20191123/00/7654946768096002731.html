      <h1>Kellyanne Conway ‘must have done some bad things’ to husband: Trump</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:07:13+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 00:07</time> by <a rel="author">Tamar Lapin</a></address>
      <p>President Trump quipped in <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/trump-claims-marie-yovanovitch-wouldnt-hang-his-portrait-at-embassy/">a television interview Friday</a> that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway “must have done some bad things” to her husband to make him act like a “whack job.”</p>
      <p>Trump was asked on “Fox &amp; Friends” about George Conway’s speculation that former US Ambassador Nikki Haley is fighting to be on the 2020 Republican ticket.</p>
      <p>“Well, first of all, Kellyanne is great, but she’s married to a total whack job,” Trump said.</p>
      <p>“I think she must have done some number on him, Ainsley,” Trump told co-host Ainsley Earhardt.</p>
      <p>George Conway is a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/24/kellyanne-conway-says-husband-gets-his-power-through-me/">notoriously vocal Trump critic</a>, despite his wife working for the commander in chief.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what Kellyanne did to that guy …,” Trump said. “He’s got to be some kind of a nut job. She must have done some bad things to him because that guy is crazy.”</p>
      <p>Trump then reiterated that Vice President Mike Pence will remain on the ticket.</p>
      <p>About Haley, he said: “Nikki will absolutely be involved. She’s a friend of mine.”</p>
      <p>“She endorsed me with the most beautiful endorsement you’ve ever heard, she did a great job at the U.N., she’s now in the private sector,” Trump said. “I assume she’s doing very well. But, Nikki will be <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/nikki-haley-keeps-door-open-for-2024-presidential-run/">back in some form</a> because she’s great, and just she’s my friend.”</p>
      <p>It’s not the first time that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/03/19/trump-calls-kellyanne-conways-husband-george-conway-a-total-loser/">Trump has come after George Conway</a>, calling him a “stone cold LOSER &amp; husband from hell!” on Twitter in March.</p>
