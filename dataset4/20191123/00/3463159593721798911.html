      <p>“I can’t remember the last time I felt so nervous,” said Illia Savich, the scorer of <a href="https://www.fifa.com/beachsoccerworldcup/teams/team/1916460/">Belarus’s</a> first ever <a href="https://www.fifa.com/beachsoccerworldcup/">FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup</a> goal, happily acknowledging a lack of composure on a big night for his country.</p>
      <p>“This is our first World Cup and there were a lot of mixed emotions for us and a lot of nerves,” the 28-year-old defender told <b>FIFA.com</b>. “I think that’s only natural.”</p>

      <p>That historic goal was the opener in his side’s <a href="https://www.fifa.com/beachsoccerworldcup/matches/match/400095732/#match-summary">5-1 defeat of United Arab Emirates</a> on Friday. Yet when asked to recall the moment, Savich admitted that his memories of it were a little hazy already.</p>
      <p>“All I remember is having the chance to hit the ball, so I just tried to get there before anyone else,” he explained. “I’m not sure how I connected with it either. I just remember seeing it go in.”</p>
      <p>It was a landmark goal that he celebrated with a minimum of fuss: “I felt a whole mix of things at the same time but I can’t pick one out or say if I thought of anyone in particular. I would have liked to but I had to get my head back in the game right away.”</p>
      <p>Nor will Savich be watching his goal over and over again. “It wasn’t the prettiest,” he said, still wearing his No3 shirt. “Maybe [I'll watch it] once or twice, but that’ll be enough.”</p>

      <p>Nicolas Alvarado, Belarus’s Spanish coach, expressed surprise at his player’s restrained reaction: “That’s what he said? Well, it didn’t look like that from where I was watching.</p>
      <p>“He’s got this special charisma, and in standing up and taking responsibility he puts a lid on any nerves he might feel. He’s very mature for his age,” added Alvarado, who had voiced his praise for Savich in an interview with <b>FIFA.com</b> <a href="https://www.fifa.com/beachsoccerworldcup/news/meet-the-man-behind-belarus-beach-breakthrough">in September.</a></p>
      <p>Identifying him as a key player in the Belarus squad, he said: “He doesn’t say an awful lot but what he does say is important. There’s a lot of respect for him among both the older and younger players. He’s like a link between the two.”</p>

      <p>Invited to take up beach soccer in his hometown of Grodno back in 2010, Savich has been playing the game professionally since 2015. “It’s my job but I love doing it,” said the defender, the scorer of three goals in the European qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Discussing Belarus’s immediate prospects in Paraguay, Savich said he has every respect for their next opponents, <a href="https://www.fifa.com/beachsoccerworldcup/teams/team/1912382/">Senegal</a>: “They played a great game against Russia and that must mean they’re a strong side.”</p>
      <p>Focusing on what he and his team have to do, he added: “Now that we’ve won our first game, I hope we can really loosen up and play even better.”</p>
