      <p>And so after 13,879 days or 38 years, Flamengo has won the Copa Libertadores for a second time in its history. In Lima the Rio giant was impotent against River Plate, an opponent that wielded all the mastery and cunning of the defending champion and, arguably, the best side in South America in the last decade, but in a stirring finale a Gabriel Barbosa ‘Gabigol’ brace completed a stunning 2-1 comeback and crowned Flamengo South America’s new king. Yet, the scoreline and late heroics from Gabigol belied a match that River Plate had dominated for 80 minutes. Diego Alves, Rafinha, Rodrigo Caio, Pablo Marí, Filipe Luis, Willian Arão, Gerson, Everton Ribeiro, Giorgian De Arrascaeta, Bruno Henrique and Gabigol, Flamengo’s new generation, all hadn’t been born in 1981 when Zico led Flamengo to victory against Cabrolea in the same competition, handing the Chilean club a soccer masterclass. Under the stewardship of Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus Flamengo wanted to repeat the feat against River Plate, but encountered a reigning champion that was superior in every department of the field.</p>
      <p>Rafael Santos Borre’s 14th-minute strike rattled Flamengo and the Rio club almost never recovered. In a disastrous sequence from the 4-4 draw with Vasco da Gama, the Brazilian rearguard’s horrid defending resurfaced and led to Borre’s goal. A superlative River Plate pressed everywhere and bamboozled the Brazilians with its aggression and dynamic attack. The Argentinean club played with bravura and the command of the reigning champion, targeting Arão in midfield. Flamengo failed to distribute the ball and left too much space in between the lines. </p>
      <p>Where had the virtues of Jesus’ team gone? The Brazilian team didn’t shape up, failed to work the angles and didn’t pass its way through the midfield. Flamengo had no leader. In midfielder Enzo Perez, who dictated the pace, and defender Javier Pinola, the Argentineans had two. Flamengo’s entire attacking quartet was peripheral and not until Gerson found his stride at the half-hour mark did an overawed Flamengo restore any semblance of balance in the game. </p>

      <p>After the interval River Plate maintained the same intensity, pressing all over the pitch and reducing Gabigol and Bruno Henrique to spectators. When a major triple chance did arrive in the 56th minute, Flamengo fluffed it. Short of the space and time on the ball they are so accustomed to in the domestic league, the Brazilian players’ decision-making remained poor.</p>
      <p>In the conservative environment of Brazilian soccer Flamengo’s high defensive line and compact lines have taken the league by storm, but River’s game plan completely hamstrung Flamengo. To compound matters the invisible Gerson, Flamengo’s midfield metronome this season, limped off injured in the 66th mine </p>
      <p>And yet that injury inadvertently turned the final. Diego came on to play his second Copa Libertadores final 16 years after his first. In 2003, he had played his first alongside Robinho for Santos against Boca Juniors, only to be on the end of a 5-1 defeat. In the Peruvian capital he seized the moment as a classic, madcap finale to the game encapsulated the richness and unpredictability of South America’s premier club competition.  </p>
      <p>Flamengo’s number ten lifted River Plate’s pressure, orchestrated the midfield and finally imbued Flamengo with a sense of cohesion. River Plate coach Marcello Gallardo had excelled as tactician, but faced with the full force of Flamengo’s desperate attack his team fell apart. </p>

      <p>The peripheral Gabigol had shown all afternoon why he didn’t make the grade at Inter Milan in Europe, despite his stellar 2019 with 40 goals in 54 games and eleven assists in Brazil. On the biggest stage in Lima he seemed to falter, but within the space of three minutes his two goals in the waning minutes of the final crowned Flamengo the Copa Libertadores champion. In echoes of the 1999 Champions League final and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s dramatic strike, Gabigol etched his name into the pantheon of Brazilian soccer gods. </p>
      <p>On Sunday, Flamengo can win the domestic league depending on the outcome of Palmeiras’ game, and in December the Rio club will participate in the Club World Cup in Qatar, dreaming of a new triumph over Liverpool. In 1981, Zico and Flamengo breezed past the English club 3-0 in the Intercontinental Cup, but whatever happens next Flamengo reigns supreme in South America.</p>
