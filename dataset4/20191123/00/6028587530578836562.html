      <p>UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones has his next fight booked. Jones, who last defended his title in July, meets No. 4 ranked 205-pound contender Dominick Reyes on February 8 in Houston, Texas.Chris Taylor of BJPenn.com<a href="https://twitter.com/CTaylor_96/status/1195809400474071040"> first reported</a> news of the bout. ESPN's Brett Okamoto <a href="https://twitter.com/bokamotoESPN/status/1197987717843316736">later confirmed</a> the fight with UFC President Dana White. Jones wrote on Twitter that he had the contract in his inbox, waiting for his signature.</p>
      <p>Jones fought twice in 2019. In his first bout of the year, he successfully defended his title with a unanimous decision win over Anthony Smith in March. His July title defense saw him score a split decision win over Thiago Santos. The victory over Santos was the first time Jones did not win a fight by unanimous decision or stoppage.Â </p>
      <p>Reyes is 12-0 as a pro. He joined the UFC in 2017 on the heels of three consecutive first-round knockout victories. Two of those wins came via head kick. Reyes also ended his first three fights with the UFC via first-round stoppage. After tow decision wins, Reyes got back on track with a "Performance of the Night" bonus-winning knockout of former UFC middleweight champion Chris Weidman. That win came in October.</p>
      <p>Before this fight was signed, there were questions if Jones would face Reyes or Corey Anderson. Earlier this month, Jones seemed to make a decision when he wrote on Twitter, "Just finished a coaches meeting studying Dominick and Cory's careers. Established Dominicks definitely the more dangerous fighter. Beating his ass next."</p>
      <p>The bout between Jones and Reyes is scheduled for February 8 at Toyota Center in Houston, Texas. The fight headlines the pay-per-view event. The co-main event is another title fight. In that contest, UFC women's flyweight Champion Valentina Shevchenko faces Katlyn Chookagian.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.oddschecker.com/us/boxing-mma/ufc-mma">early odd</a>s for the Jones vs. Reyes matchup are heavily in the champion's favor. Jones is a -550 favorite over Reyes, who comes in as a +390 underdog.</p>
