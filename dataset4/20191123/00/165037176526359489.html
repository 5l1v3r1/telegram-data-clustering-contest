        <b>In a matter of days, two future Real Madrid stars will play at the Bernabeú. First, it will be Martin Odegaard, and mid-week it will be Kylian Mbappés turn.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The first one has the definitive opportunity to impress a team that is already dazzled, to the point of seeming convinced that they will recall him at the end of this season, no matter what it takes.</p>
      <p>Days later it will be the turn of the great desire, <b>Mbappé, who will play at the Bernabéu in the Champions League with PSG</b>. In less than a week, 2 promising players, <b>one of them who is sure to play for Real Madrid sooner rather than later</b>, will be reviewed by the Bernabéu.</p>

      <p>Those who may mark the future of Madrid will face those who today are called to embody that future, like <b>Rodrygo and Vinicius</b>, under <b>Hazard's wing</b>.</p>
      <p><b>Odegaard and Mbappé</b> will play their respective matches with different objectives. Both will try to win, but only one will do it to impress what will be his future club. <b>Mbappé</b> does not need it, but it is important not to forget that he is still at <b>PSG</b>.</p>
