      <h2>Charlie Nicholas looks ahead to Man United's trip to Sheffield United on Sunday afternoon</h2>

      <h3>Charlie Nicholas is tipping Sheffield United to hold Manchester United to a 1-1 draw in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon.</h3>
      <p>The Red Devils head into the game looking to make it back to back wins in the top flight after their 3-1 win over Brighton and Hove Albion last time out.</p>
      <p>Manchester United are currently languishing down in seventh place in the Premier League table as they look to try and break back into the top four this season.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men have struggled to find consistent form in the Premier League all season and they have only won four of their opening 12 games in the top flight this term.</p>
      <p>Sheffield United, meanwhile, are in fifth place after having won four of their opening 12 games this season.</p>
      <p>Manchester United will travel to Bramall Lane looking to try and kick-start a good run of form heading into the hectic festive period.</p>
      <p>But former Arsenal star Nicholas is tipping the Red Devils to be held to a draw by the Blades this weekend.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12090/11866441/charlie-nicholas-premier-league-predictions">Sky Sports</a>, Nicholas said: “Sheffield United are fifth and Manchester United sit in seventh. Who has more energy? Sheffield United. Who has more passion? Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>“Manchester United have the better players but only when they play well. I have been impressed with Sheffield United more recently as they have been scoring goals. They will be right in the face of Man Utd from the get-go so if they are good enough, they will need to show it and be together as a team.</p>
      <p>“I do feel that Man Utd will be vulnerable to this energy level as they can become moody, but they will get something from it nevertheless.</p>
      <p>“Chris Wilder will have a feeling about what his side can achieve realistically, but if you said to him that from the first 12 games, your away record would be fabulous, they would have beaten Arsenal and drawn with Manchester United at home, he would have snapped your hand off.</p>
      <p>“They probably expect to beat Man Utd at the moment, but I think Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side will be ready for it.</p>
      <p>“It will be another feisty game. Sheffield United will go after and squeeze Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial as much as they can. The back three are very good at what they do but John Egan has been one of the players of the season.</p>
      <p>“The others have been great but he is calm, aggressive when he needs to be and gets his teammates into position – they are well-organised and drilled. For that reason, I think they will get a draw.”</p>
      <p>Manchester United are aiming to break back into the top four this season after having finished sixth and without a trophy last term.</p>
