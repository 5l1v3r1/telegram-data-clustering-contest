      <p>The death of a 1-year-old Brooklyn boy has been ruled a homicide, authorities said Friday.</p>
      <p>Cops responding to a 911 call discovered little Aidenn Joyette unconscious and unresponsive at his family’s home on Winthrop Street in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens around 10 a.m. Tuesday, officials said.</p>
      <p>Medics then rushed the child to NYC Health + Hospitals/Kings County where he was pronounced dead, authorities said.</p>
      <p>The tot’s mother told police that she went to bed the night before and when she awoke Tuesday morning, Aidenn was not breathing, so she called the cops, police said.</p>
      <p>Police sources said there is a history of domestic violence at the home, but it was unclear who it involved.</p>
      <p>Sources added that Aidenn’s mother will be questioned in the boy’s death.</p>
      <p>Four other children, ages 4, 7, 16 and 18, live in the Brooklyn home, sources said.</p>
      <p>“Our top priority is protecting the safety and well-being of all children in New York City,” the city’s Administration for Children’s Services said in a statement. “We are investigating this case with NYPD, and we have taken action to secure the safety of the other children in this home.”</p>
