      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - Officials say a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/long-island-rail-road/">Long Island Rail Road</a> train has derailed in Queens, but there are no reports of injuries.</p>
      <p>The commuter railroad tweeted that two cars of an eastbound train derailed just east of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jamaica/">Jamaica</a> station Friday night. A Metropolitan Transit Authority statement says the derailment took place around a half-hour after the 10-car train left Penn Station at 8:56 p.m., bound for Babylon.</p>
      <p>The statement said no injuries were reported. A relief train had arrived by 11 p.m. to take around 600 passengers to their final destinations. Crews on scene handed out water.</p>
      <p>The derailment’s cause is under investigation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jamaica/">Jamaica</a> is a major hub for the LIRR, the nation’s busiest commuter railroad that carries an average of over 300,000 riders each weekday.</p>
