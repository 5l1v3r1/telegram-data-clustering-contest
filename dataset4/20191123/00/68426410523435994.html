      <p>Jacob Trouba scored the go-ahead goal in the third period as the New York Rangers overcame a four-goal deficit to stun the Montreal Canadiens 6-5 on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Brendan Lemieux, with two, Filip Chytil, Pavel Buchnevich and Artemi Panarin also scored for the Rangers (10-9-2), who were down 4-0 early in the second period.</p>
      <p>Backup goalie Alexandar Georgiev stopped 38-of-43 shots in the second game of a back-to-back for New York following a 4-1 loss in Ottawa on Friday.</p>
      <p>Max Domi and Artturi Lehkonen each scored twice and Shea Weber added another for the Canadiens (11-7-5), who have lost a season-high four games in a row. Nick Suzuki and Ben Chiarot had two assists apiece.</p>
      <p>Carey Price stopped 28-of-34 shots in defeat.</p>
      <p>The Rangers were losing 5-3 in the third period before putting three unanswered goals past Price.</p>
      <p>Panarin scored at 5:51 on a no-look backhand pass from Chris Kreider, just 31 seconds after Lehkonen beat Georgiev from the slot for his second of the night.</p>
      <p>Lemieux tied the game at 5-5 with a short-handed marker at 8:41 on a 2-on-1 with Brett Howden.</p>
      <p>Trouba completed the improbable comeback with a shot from the point that went off Jeff Petry and in with 7:50 left in the game.</p>
      <p>Montreal lost in regulation time for the first time this season when leading after the first period (6-1-1).</p>
      <p>The well-rested Canadiens were cruising towards a victory by leading 4-0 after 23 minutes of play.</p>
      <p>Domi, back at centre after playing the last three games on the wing, snapped a nine-game goalless drought 2:03 into the encounter from the edge of the crease.</p>
      <p>Montreal went up 2-0 exactly halfway through the first when Lehkonen fired a perfect shot far post on Georgiev while using Jacob Trouba as a screen.</p>
      <p>Domi made it 3-0 with his second goal of the night on a quick release that caught Georgiev off guard with 34 seconds left in the period.</p>
      <p>New York backup goalie got a piece of Weber’s slap shot at 2:51 of the second but the puck still trickled in behind him.</p>
      <p>The Rangers were down but not out and they put three pucks past Price in a 3:20 span in the second.</p>
      <p>An unmarked Chytil scored the first for the visitors with a one-timer at 6:11 on a pass from Panarin.</p>
      <p>Buchnevich, playing his 200th NHL game, made it 4-2 at 7:06 when his shot went off defenceman Cale Fleury and in for his fourth of the year.</p>
      <p>Lemieux got the Rangers within one at 9:30 by deflecting Adam Fox’s shot past Price as a penalty to Phillip Danault expired.</p>
