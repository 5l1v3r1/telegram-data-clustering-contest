      <p>IN-FORM midfielder, Dominic Mukandi, has experienced both sides of the Harare Derby.</p>
      <p>He played for Dynamos in 2016 before retracing his footsteps back to the Green Machine.</p>
      <p>The midfielder missed a golden opportunity to win the title with Caps United three years ago when he crossed to join DeMbare for one season.</p>
      <p>He feels this year Makepekepe, who have a two-point cushion at the top of the table going into the last three games of the season, will be champions.</p>
      <p>A win over DeMbare tomorrow will push them closer to lifting the title.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, he has never featured in a winning side in the Derby.</p>
      <p>“Of course, it’s a Derby and people may say lot of things about it but, personally, I am not going to put myself under pressure with such a thought,’’ said Mukandi.</p>
      <p>“I am looking at it as one of the games we need to win because we want the title.</p>
      <p>“This is a game we have been waiting for in a long time. We hope to collect maximum points in this game and enhance our chances of lifting the title.’’</p>
      <p>The Green Machine lead the race with 55 points, two ahead of nearest rivals Chicken Inn and FC Platinum.</p>
      <p>All the three teams dropped points last week with Caps United surrendering a two-goal advantage in a 2-2 stalemate with Yadah.</p>
      <p>Now, they are looking for a response.</p>
      <p>“If you look at it, the second half of the league has been difficult for everyone,’’ said Mukandi.</p>
      <p>“But, this year, we have a better opportunity.</p>
      <p>“We have been working hard since Tuesday and we hope to concentrate on the bigger picture, which is about winning the title.</p>
      <p>“Of course, things haven’t gone to perfection, in our last few games, but God has been on our side, our rivals in the title race have also been dropping points.</p>
      <p>“However, we are not concentrating on how the other teams are playing. We know our shortcomings and we hope to correct them.”</p>
      <p>Obviously, Makepekepe will be following with keen interest as second-placed Chicken Inn play Bulawayo Chiefs at Luveve this afternoon.</p>
      <p>FC Platinum have a date against Chapungu at Ascot tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Caps United are set to welcome striker Newman Sianchali, who was suspended for last week’s game against Yadah.</p>
      <p>He returns at a time fellow striker, John Zhuwawu, has been ruled out through suspension.</p>
      <p>“The Derby doesn’t need a coach to push you to perform,’’ said Sianchali.</p>
      <p>“You are motivated just by the feeling you are playing the Derby. It’s a big game so you don’t need the coach or the supporters to push you.</p>
      <p>“We have to do the job and then the rest will follow,” said Sianchali.</p>
      <p>Dynamos are playing for pride, and to maintain an unbeaten run stretching 19 league matches, in this Derby.</p>
      <p>A win could help them keep alive their chances of finishing in the top four.</p>
      <p>Defensive midfielder Godfrey Mukambi, who has featured in the last five Harare Derbies, believes they have a chance to grind a victory tomorrow.</p>
      <p>“We are looking forward to the Caps United match, which has come at the right time when we have rediscovered our form,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>“The team has been working hard and we need to upset Caps United.</p>
      <p>“Any match against Caps United is never easy and we are not going to read much into their current position on the log standings.</p>
      <p>“We are not playing for any side to clinch the title but for our targets. After we missed out on the championship,we shifted our target to a top four.</p>
      <p>“Losing the points to Caps United means we will have done ourselves a disservice.</p>
      <p>“There is still a lot to play for. We were counted out during the first half of the season but we are now a force to reckon with.’’</p>
      <p>Mukambi said coach Tonderai Ndiraya should be given a lot of credit for the work he has done at Dynamos.</p>
      <p>“We are going to get a full set of points on Sunday and we need to do that for our coach and supporters who have stood with us through thick and thin,’’ said Mukambi.</p>
      <p>“The team went through a difficult time at the beginning of the season but we have since put that behind us.</p>
      <p>“The coming on board of coach Ndiraya changed everything. Everyone seems happy at the moment and as a senior player I try by all means to support him.</p>
      <p>“Ndiraya is someone who demands results and it helps to push us to go the extra mile.</p>
      <p>‘’There are several players who have improved under Ndiraya and I am sure this time we will not settle for a draw.”</p>
