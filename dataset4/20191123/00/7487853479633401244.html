      <h1>Gareth Bale Set for First Home Appearance for Real Madrid in 49 Days Despite Wales Controversy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/12955694" target="_blank">Ben Carter</a></address>
      <p>​Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale is set to walk out at the Santiago Bernabéu for the first time in almost two months after being selected in Zinedine Zidane's squad to face Real Sociedad on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Wales international caused quite a stir in the Spanish capital over the last two weeks when he celebrated qualification to Euro 2020 alongside a 'Wales. Golf. Madrid' flag - a dig at Los Blancos for their treatment of the 30-year-old.</p>
      <p>Even though <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/gareth-bale">Bale's</a> celebrations didn't sit well with the decision-makers at <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/2019/11/22/5dd7ff1222601d46428b45b8.html">Marca</a> confirm that manager Zidane has selected the former <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/tottenham">Tottenham Hotspur</a> forward to be part of the squad this weekend.</p>

      <p>Bale's even been selected ahead of Vinícius Júnior, who has lost his place on the left side to 18-year-old summer signing Rodrygo.</p>
      <p>Although there is an obvious anger surrounding Bale's actions with Wales at Real Madrid, Zidane actually appears to be in the player's corner and <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6502382-zinedine-zidane-tells-real-madrid-fans-to-get-behind-important-gareth-bale-after-wild-week?view_source=teams_page&amp;view_medium=[real-madrid]">called on fans to support the forward when he returns</a> this weekend.</p>
      <p>"There’s been a lot of noise about what he did but we need to just focus on football. It’s all got a bit too much," he said. "I’m just looking at what he can give us on the pitch, not what’s said off it, that doesn’t interest me.</p>
      <p>"I believe he can become a decisive player for us again. He’s an important player when he is injury-free; he’s shown that before and he will show it again.</p>

      <p>"When you see what he’s given to the club and to the fans, those who feel our colours and come to the stadium, you can see he’s one of our own and the fans need to get behind him."</p>
      <p>Elsewhere for Real Madrid, Nacho Fernández, Lucas Vázquez, <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/james-rodriguez">James Rodríguez</a> and <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/marco-asensio">Marco Asensio</a> will all be absent on Saturday due to injury.</p>
