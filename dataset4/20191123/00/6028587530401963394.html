      <p>While video streaming is considered a powerful marketing tool, it comes with several challenges in terms of technological requirements. Video streaming includes the transmission of large data pockets that results in latency issues – the frustrating buffering that ruins any viewer’s experience.</p>
      <p>By scaling on cloud, streaming platforms can increase their bandwidth to provide better video streaming performance and viewing experience. Certain startups provide video streaming services to businesses that want to leverage this tool but don’t have the required interface.</p>
      <p>Since most enterprises don’t have networks capable of handling video streaming and heavy traffic, there is a large demand for cloud scaling and video streaming platforms. Here are three startups worth mentioning that have used cloud to scale and increase their capabilities for purposes such as video delivery, live streaming, and gaming:</p>

        <li><a href="https://clutch.win/"><b>Clutch</b></a><b> – </b>Clutch is a San Francisco-based company that uses short-form gameplay videos to create one of the fastest-growing social gaming communities on the internet. With over $4 million in investment, Clutch has developed a platform to let gamers easily edit and upload their gaming highlights and connect with a positive community of others who share common gaming interests.</li>
