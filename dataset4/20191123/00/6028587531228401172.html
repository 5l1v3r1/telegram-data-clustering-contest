      <p>It’s that time of year again. If you’re like many of my clients, you’re looking for ways to best navigate your financial affairs and for some clues as to what the end of the year will bring.What will all this talk of tariffs and the nation’s political chaos mean for Americans’ financial bottom line?</p>
      <p>You can start now to create some buffers against potential financial disaster.</p>
      <p>Let’s begin with holiday spending.</p>
      <p>With the possibility that the U.S. might institute more tariffs in December, you can avoid the expected steep price climb for almost all Chinese imports, including -- yes -- toys and game consoles.</p>
      <p>My family has decided to celebrate the holidays with memory-making experiences instead of pricey gifts. But even a family road trip won’t be cheap. Gas prices have reached a five-year high, with prices at California pumps the highest in the nation!</p>

That too can be expensive, but there are ways to save big.</a>
      </p>
      <p>I recently joined Good Day LA reporters Araksya Karapetyan and Dan Cohen to discuss some holiday travel money-saving data from Adobe Analytics.</p>
      <p>Here are some tips we came up with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For those thinking of traveling for New Years, November is the best month to <a href="https://www.adobe.com/">book.</a> (Adobe).</li>
        <li>Remember that ticket prices for the weeks surrounding Thanksgiving and Christmas can be as much as 17% higher than usual. You might consider flying to Grandma’s house just after those holidays and have a later but less costly family celebration. (Adobe Analytics)</li>
        <li>If you don’t mind taking a risk that flights will be sold out, you can hold off until the first week in December to book Christmas flights, when fares usually drop about 13%.  But they will jump up again soon, so keep an eye on that calendar! (Adobe Analytics)</li>
        <li> Adobe Analytics expects fares to be 5% lower this Thanksgiving than last year, reversing a recent trend of price hikes averaging 6% every Thanksgiving period since 2016.</li>
        <li>Still determined to be at Grandma’s house on Thanksgiving or Christmas? You can save big if you are willing to fly <i>on</i> those holidays.  Christmas Eve flights are also cheaper on some carriers. The <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/">Saturday </a>before a major holiday is typically the most expensive time to fly.</li>
        <li>Sign up for alerts for fares, so you know when prices drop.</li>
        <li>Look at alternative airports: Fares can vary widely among airports in the same general region.</li>
        <li>Review your credit cards and make sure you are purchasing your tickets with the card that will give you the most points.</li>
        <li>Hotels are a different story; it is best to wait and book them up to six days before your arrival to get the lowest price. If it is a major tourist destination, however, you may not get the hotel you want, so take that into<a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/holiday-flights-thanksgiving-christmas-2019/index.html"> account. </a></li>
        <li>Expect the worst delays shortly after Christmas, as a crush of homeward-bound passengers and the potential for bad weather can combine for traveling nightmares.  According to Forbes, 66% of airports reported their worst delays after Christmas, while 44% of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lealane/2018/12/10/holiday-delays-10-years-of-flight-data-for-u-s-busiest-airports-including-worst-best-hubs/#3c1c1f1c414d">airports</a> said Dec. 26 is the most unfavorable day for holiday delays/</li>
        <li>Airports with reputations for delays before Christmas include San Francisco International, Ronald Reagan Washington National, Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International and Tampa <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lealane/2018/12/10/holiday-delays-10-years-of-flight-data-for-u-s-busiest-airports-including-worst-best-hubs/#6ea61cba414d">International.</a></li>
        <li>Chicago ranks highest for holiday delays. If you’re departing from one of Chicago’s two airports this holiday season, there’s about a 40% chance your flight will be late. Only 61.5% of flights departing Chicago Midway arrived at their destination on time over the past 10 years of holiday travel. O’Hare isn’t much better, with only 61.6% of flights arriving at their destination on time. But it’s worse when it comes to cancellations, with nearly 5% of its flights canceled the last 10 holiday travel seasons.</li>
        <li>Never book a connecting flight when a non-stop is available for within $200</li>

        </li>
        <li>Use a credit card with built-in credit protection when booking a flight. For example book with a card that pays for travel, lost luggage or trip cancellation insurance.</li>
        <li>Choose your holiday for travel with an eye toward savings.  <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fwinniesun%2F2019%2F11%2F23%2Fskip-the-tariffs-on-holiday-shopping-this-year-and-consider-booking-travel-instead%2F&amp;text=No%20matter%20when%20you%20book%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%2017%25%20cheaper%20to%20fly%20for%20Thanksgiving%20than%20for%20Christmas.%20%23WinnieSun%20%40Forbes">No matter when you book, it’s 17% cheaper to fly for Thanksgiving than for Christmas.</a></li>
