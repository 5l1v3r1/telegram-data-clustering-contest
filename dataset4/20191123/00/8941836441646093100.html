      <p>CANTON, Ohio (AP) - The Ohio Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission says it is now providing free, reliable public Wi-Fi inside all 14 service plazas along the toll road.</p>
      <p>It says the upgrade replaces an inconsistent patchwork of systems that had been provided by food vendors at those stops along the 241-mile roadway across northern Ohio.</p>
      <p>Director Ferzan Ahmed says the new system offers seamless Wi-Fi access even at service plazas in more remote areas.</p>
      <p>The plazas began offering the new Wi-Fi in mid-November.</p>
      <p>The commission says the contract cost nearly $1.9 million, including Wi-Fi and 24-hour customer support for five years, plus equipment, installation and configuration. The project also included network connectivity improvements for turnpike operations, such as toll plazas and maintenance buildings.</p>
