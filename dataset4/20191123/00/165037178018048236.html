        <b>Real Madrid welcomed fifth place Real Sociedad to the Santiago Bernabeu in what was destined to be a game full of action, as La Liga returned after the international break.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Zinedine Zidane</b> will come away from the game happy as his side <b>secured all three points</b> in Saturday's La Liga game against <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/real-sociedad/">Real Sociedad </a>at the <b>Santiago Bernabeu.</b></p>
      <p><b>Rodrygo started for Madrid</b> and Gareth Bale stepped up his recovery from injury by being named on the bench. However, the game did not start how <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a> had planned.</p>
      <p>2 minutes into play <b>Sergio Ramos received the ball </b>and decided to pass it back to Courtois, however,<b> Willian Jose got to it first </b>and he gets past the keeper and just meanly slots the ball into the bottom, far corner, to give the visitors the lead early on. This stunned everyone in Madrid and<b> it took them a while to recover.</b></p>
      <p><b>Sociedad were definitely the best team in the first 25 minutes, </b>Willian Jose shot straight at the keeper after getting the ball in the box and Courtois let the ball slip out, meaning there was a scuffle between the two sides for the ball. Real Madrid eventually cleared it away, but they were under a lot of pressure! </p>
      <p>Real Madrid decided to work some magic and equalise in the 36th minute. <b>A Modric free kick saw the ball fly into the box,</b> where <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/k-benzema-3318/">Karim Benzema</a> was waiting to slot it into the back of the net, after beating the defenders to it. <b>Madrid were now back in the game! </b></p>

      <p>Half time saw the game all level at the break. <b>Madrid really struggled to get into the game</b> at first and conceded a very early goal, but towards the end of the half they looked more convincing and ready to fight. <b>Real Sociedad also came out fighting. </b></p>
      <p>There was an early goal in the start of the second half too, as two minutes in <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/f-valverde-281486/">Fede Valverde</a> shocked everyone. <b>Modric passed him the ball, just outside the box </b>and this saw him try his luck from range, nobody expected the strike and nobody could do anything about it.<b> A powerful, well controlled goal to put Madrid in the lead</b> two minutes into the second half.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/l-modric-26968/">Luka Modric </a>sealed the deal for the Whites, as his<b> curling effort from the edge of the box </b>snook past the keeper and into the back of the net. 3-1! </p>
      <p>Real Sociedad are <b>one of the two La Liga sides to have scored 100% of their goals from inside the box</b> this season (21 - along with Atletico Madrid, 15), while Real Madrid are the only side to have conceded 100% of their goals from inside the box (nine).</p>
      <p>At the final whistle, <b>Real Madrid take the three points after a convincing win over Real Sociedad.</b> The visitors started well, but failed to keep up with the pace they displayed early on and let Madrid walk over them by the end of it! <b>Real Madrid 3-1 Real Sociedad</b></p>
