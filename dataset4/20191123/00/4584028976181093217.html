      <p>Zach LaVine hit a franchise-record 13 three-pointers as the Chicago Bulls completed a stunning last-gasp comeback against the Charlotte Hornets 116-115.</p>
      <p>LaVine, who finished with a career-high 49 points, nailed the game-winning three with 0.8 seconds remaining in Charlotte on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Bulls trailed by five points with less than 10 seconds to go before escaping with a road win against the Hornets.</p>
      <p>Tomas Satoransky hit a three-pointer with 7.1 seconds remaining and Coby White made a steal to set up LaVine's unforgettable game-winning shot from the wing.</p>
      <p>LaVine, who had 27 fourth-quarter points, tied an NBA record â€“ becoming only the third player behind Golden State Warriors pair Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson to score 13 shots from beyond the arc.</p>
      <p>"Once I shot it, I knew it was cash. That was the craziest game I've been a part of," LaVine said.</p>
      <p>Bulls team-mate Thad Young added: "Zach was like a Disney commercial: where magic happens."</p>
