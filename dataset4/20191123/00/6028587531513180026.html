      <p>London based model, mum, girl crush and gal-about-town <a href="https://www.instagram.com/portiaportiaaaa/?hl=en">Portia Freeman</a> has modelled for all the big hitters from Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Emilia Wickstead, Fendi, and Mary Katrantzou to Céline, Marc Jacobs, Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Alexander McQueen. That’s an impressive list right here. She always finds her way back to London though, and she’s shared her little black book of the very best spots in town from the coziest pub in Highgate to the Larry King salon (cue awesome hair) in Kensington.</p>

        <b>Shop: John Lewis</b>
      </p>
      <p>With so many amazing places to shop in Central London, I naturally gravitate towards John Lewis in Brent Cross for my more day to day essentials. This being because it’s not too far from where I live and sometimes (a lot of the time) I like to avoid the hustle and bustle of Central London. John Lewis to me has everything under one roof. </p>

        <b>Play: Trent Park Equestrian Centre</b>
      </p>
      <p>Recently I’ve rediscovered my love for horses. As a kid, I used to ride on the weekends and finding this gem so close to where I live has been amazing. It’s such a mind-clearing hobby which is perfect when you live in a city. The surroundings are lush and filled with plenty of space to go on satisfying hacks and the stables itself is great for any level rider. A wonderful selection of friendly horses this really is one of my fave places to ‘play’.</p>

        <b>Stay: The Ned</b>
      </p>
      <p>I absolutely adore this hotel! I’ve stayed a number of times and each stay has been a totally different vibe. Whether it’s a romantic staycation or celebrating a big birthday this hotel really does cater for all. The variety of restaurants and bars - personal fave Cecconi's offering Northern Italian dishes, great if you’re a pasta lover like me or head there for the Sunday feast in the main hall, think Henry VIII style banquet, food and drink overflowing so it's the perfect excuse to check-in for the night. And not forgetting the rooftop overlooking the city whilst listening to great tunes and sipping on the best Frosé in London. </p>

        <b>Bar: Scarfes Bar</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scarfes Bar is where I head to if I decide to make a pitstop for a cheeky cocktail or two on my way home from dinner. Located in the oh so beautiful Rosewood Hotel, Holborn, this bar really is a great way to escape the loud noise of London's nightlife. The vibe is opulent, sexy with candlelight glimmering onto rich velvets and the dreamiest dark parquet floor. It’s a great spot that offers live music and gimmicky artwork of the Royal Family. Fave spot to sit - at the bar! It’s a great way to see the mixologists work their magic.</p>

        <b>Eat: Max’s Sandwich Shop</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, people, I said sandwich shop and you haven’t lived if you’ve not been to Max’s Sandwich Shop. With the most killer sandwiches which are big enough to share, along with mouth-watering sides you need to head down to this little back street beauty. The vibe is low key, cozy and has the most amazing energy. With queues that wrap around the block, be sure to get here early! Oh, and did I mention that Max is an absolute legend! You’ll hear him bellowing hello before you’ve even reached the door! </p>

        <b>Music: The Royal Albert Hall</b>
      </p>
      <p>For me The Royal Albert Hall really does have to be the best place in London to watch live performances. They host such a wide range of performances so it really does fit for all. The most recent gig we went to was to watch Star Wars whilst the orchestra played live and it certainly didn’t fail. Whether you’re going out and fancy dressing up for an evening treat or it's a casual day time affair, The Royal Albert Hall is always a hit in my opinion.</p>

        <b>Chill out: The Red Lion and Sun</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ok, so yes this is a pub and yes there have been evenings where we’ve headed home a little later than we had first anticipated (they have the best wine selection) but this gorgeous North London local of ours will always be a solid go-to for our Sunday chill.</p>

      <p>It’s my favorite place to head for a Sunday roast and now we're rolling into the cozy winter months, the fire is always lit, papers/magazines at the ready, this place really does have the chill factor.</p>

      <p>The one and only place I’ll go to get my hair pimped and pruned is at Larry King's Salon, South Kensington.</p>

        <b>﻿Culture: Saatchi Gallery</b>
      </p>
      <p>Finding myself here a fair bit from time to time, the Kings Road having its own pockets of history and legendary tales from the years gone by I always find time to pop into the Saatchi Gallery.</p>

        <b>Landmark/building: Fitzrovia Chapel</b>
      </p>
      <p>There are so many amazing landmarks or buildings to choose from living in London but there’s nothing more than I love than stumbling upon hidden treasures and the Fitzrovia Chapel is exactly that. With its gold mosaic domes and calming energy, it’s such a great place to visit whether it’s to check out an exhibition or slip into a little meditation on one of their open days.</p>

        <b>Book/magazine store: Hatchards </b>
      </p>
      <p>Hatchards makes you feel like you’ve stepped into another era. With all of the history under one roof, not to mention that it's the oldest book store in the UK, the fact this is on my doorstep I definitely try to not take this for granted. You’ll find me here when I’ve got an hour to kill popping from meeting to meeting to escape central London’s hustle and bustle.</p>

        <b>Fave Place: Hampstead Heath/Kenwood House</b>
      </p>
      <p>When I'm not doing all of the above you’ll find me walking my dog here. I love the healing energy Hampstead Heath holds. Great for a brisk power walk or a long lazy picnic in the summer months, this little slice of heaven in the city is the perfect place to clear the cobwebs away.</p>
