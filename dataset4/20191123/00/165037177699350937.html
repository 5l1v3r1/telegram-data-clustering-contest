        <b>Valencia coach, Albert Celades, stated after the defeat against Betis, that "now he is only thinking about the next game that comes, which is in the Champions League against Chelsea, next Wednesday at Mestalla.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Celades stated that his team <b>did not go into the game at Benito Villamarin thinking about the Champions League clash with Chelsea,</b> "because the best way to go into a game is by winning the last".</p>
      <p>About Canales' goal from a free kick in the 93rd minute, the coach said that heÂ does <b>not believe that there was "lack of intensity" i</b>n his team when defending the launching of the Betis midfielder, and emphasised that "the last minutes became a very open party, with both teams attacking and where everyone's battling for the win".</p>
