      <p>Reverend Laurie Idahosa is the wife of Bishop Faith Idahosa of the Church of God Mission International. The Director, Campus Life Division, at the Benson Idahosa University talks about her passion, family and experience as a white woman living in Nigeria, in this interview with ALEXANDER OKERE</p>

        <b>
          <i>In your biography, you said you were born in a “pastor’s home”. How different was your childhood?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>When I was born, my dad was working in a Chrysler factory and my mom was a waitress. They were quite young when they had me – just 20 and 21 years old, respectively. When I was a baby, they left their jobs and launched their own businesses. After being quite successful in business, when I was around 10 years old, my parents responded to a call of God on their lives. They sold their businesses and went full time in the ministry, launching a church in our home.</p>
      <p>For most of my childhood and all my adult life, my parents have been in the ministry and have also continued entrepreneurial endeavour to support their income. Growing up as a Whetstone (my maiden name) was uniquely exciting. It was one adventure after another. Because of the diversity of experiences and exposure they gave me, I had the opportunity to be prepared for the life that marriage and moving to Nigeria was going to bring me.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>You had your educational qualifications, including your bachelor’s degree in the Christian religion. Why didn’t you consider the conventional fields of study, like medicine, law, the arts or social sciences?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I chose to get my first degree in Christian Ministry because I felt that it was in alignment with where my future was headed. But I’ve also been trained in other areas such as becoming an emergency medical technician, disaster relief responder, real estate investor and first aid and CPR (Cardiopulmonary resuscitation) instructor.</p>
      <p>I had got involved in a hodgepodge of things, but I saw them more as hobbies than as fields of academic interest. My passion has always been to reach people for Jesus Christ, and I felt that the most significant education that I could get would be in the field where my passion was.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>When and how did you meet your husband?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>In the summer of 1987, at the age of 13, I came to Nigeria on a trip with my father. The late Archbishop Benson Idahosa had been a friend and mentor to my father, so he (dad) was coming to Nigeria to do some missionary work with Church of God Mission and he carried me along on his inaugural visit.</p>
      <p>I stayed at their family house at the time, and that is where I met my husband. He was 14 at the time, was tall and skinny, and I just thought he was so handsome; it felt like love at first sight and we connected immediately. We just liked each other. From there, it blossomed into a beautiful friendship which eventually turned into a beautiful relationship and marriage many, many years later.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>How did he convince you that he was right for you?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>When FEB (Idahosa) asked me to marry him, it was such a beautiful day. We were standing outside underneath a palm tree where we were to build our house in Benin City. It was raining and he couldn’t get down on one knee, but he looked at me and said that was the place where he wanted to build his first home and he’d like me to be his wife and live in this house with him.</p>
      <p>In fact, at that point, he didn’t need to convince me because I already loved him and wanted to marry him. I already wanted to be someone who stood by his side for the rest of his life. So, it was very easy to say “yes” to him. It was such a beautiful engagement experience because it was just the two of us. It was a quiet and intimate evening. Due to the ground being wet the first time he proposed, when we got back into the house, I made him get down on his knee and ask me properly.</p>
      <p>I always wanted that experience of a man getting down on his knee to propose. He did and I said “yes” once again. It wasn’t hard to convince both our families that we belonged together. We always had such chemistry and connection which made it easy for them to acknowledge that truly, we were made for one another.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>What stands him out from other people that you still can’t unravel but feel excited about?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The thing I love the most about FEB is that he’s an extremely humble person. It amazes me how he has this remarkable name, Idahosa, that has made such an impact in the African community; yet, he remains humble, caring, and patient with people to ensure they succeed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>What was your parents’ first impression when he proposed to you?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Interestingly enough, my parents were a part of the proposal process. My husband asked my dad if he could ask me to marry him long before he asked me. He and my dad went together to get my engagement ring; it was a family affair. So, it wasn’t difficult for my parents to accept him as the person who was to be my spouse.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>What was your first, honest impression about Nigeria and its people?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I first came to Nigeria when I was 11 years old, and I visited Enugu State. This was before we met the Idahosas. I fell in love with Nigeria from my first visit. My father was friends with the Onuigbo family, and we enjoyed doing missionary work together in the eastern part of the country.</p>
      <p>We felt such warmth and love from everyone we encountered that I felt Nigeria was home. On our flight back to the United States, I cried all the way from Lagos to New York. Even as a little girl, I felt like this was my home. I loved Nigeria and her people from day one and knew that this is where I wanted to be for the rest of my life. It would take 17 years from that visit for me to move here, but I’ve never regretted it, not one bit!</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>What are the impressions people in Europe and the US have about Nigeria that you think are untrue?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Many people in the United States tend to be ignorant of African geography and history. One time, when I first moved here and went home for a visit, someone came up to me and asked me if they wore clothes where I lived. I think that was the height of ignorance that I saw in my American community. Nigerians are much more exposed to the world; they have a global perspective that I think a lot of Americans are lacking, and I believe this is something we offer the world—we see the world from a bigger perspective than some people in the western world do.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Many people experience cultural shock when they visit a place outside their country for the first time. What was your experience in this regard?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I had been travelling around the world with my parents as I was a little child, and I accompanied them on my first international trip before I was seven years old. I have seen different cultures—I lived in Indonesia for a period of time, lived in Guatemala and visited Mexico regularly. I had also been in different African countries. So, when coming to Nigeria for the first time, I cannot say I experienced any major cultural shocks. My cultural shock came when I chose to live here as a wife and experience life, not as a visitor or as a missionary.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>How long did it take you to get used to the Nigerian way of life?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I don’t think I can ever say I’m truly accustomed to the Nigerian way of life, as it changes. My Nigerian experience changed when I was going through an infertility journey as I saw how much value the community placed on childbearing. Then I experienced being a new mother and my name changing to ‘Iye FEB’. Now, I am a mother to young children and still look forward to enjoying the joys of becoming a grandmother someday, and that will be a totally different experience.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>How did you feel when you had your first child?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I felt like any mother would when I saw my first child. I remember looking at him and seeing the most perfect child that could ever be born. My first child was born in 2007 and we named him Benson Idahosa, after my father-in- law. Unfortunately, he only lived for 12 hours after he was born and it was a quick turn of events from extreme happiness to extreme sadness. God has been faithful to us, a year and a few days later from that day, I had another baby boy, FEB Jnr, who is now 11 years old and thriving. He also has two brothers, Nathaniel and Judah, who are eight and six years old. I just remember feeling elated that God gave me children to carry on my husband’s legacy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>As a child, wife and mother, what were the most challenging moments of your life and how did you overcome them?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the biggest challenges that I have faced is something that cuts across all three of those stages of life, and that’s with my self-esteem. A lot of times, I didn’t believe I was worthy or good enough. As a child, I was afraid of taking on big tasks that seemed larger than my capacity.</p>
      <p>As a wife, I feared that I could not handle living as a wife to the only biological son of the late Archbishop Benson Idahosa. As a mum, I was concerned about not being good enough for my three boys. I have handled my insecurities by really understanding who I am in Christ Jesus and realising that in Christ, I can do all things.</p>
      <p>

          <i>Your husband is from the Bini tribe. What part or parts of the culture do you find the most interesting?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I think the traditional marriage in the Bini tribe is very interesting. I love the way it is done, especially the part where different ladies are brought out and the groom is asked which among them is his wife, and when he talks about ‘plucking a flower from my father’s garden’. I just thought the whole thing was absolutely beautiful. However, the thing I found most intriguing, was how a Bini bride was supposed to act shy. I didn’t understand being shy. I remember some ladies from the palace helping to teach me what to do. I remember them telling me to put a white handkerchief over my mouth and not look in people’s eyes and how to look like I was shy. I remember covering my mouth with a white handkerchief and having the biggest smile behind it. I am not a shy person, so it was hard for me to act like I was. It was fun and I’ve grown to love the Bini culture.</p>

          <i>What was the first Nigerian dish you had?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I was 11 when I first came to Nigeria, so I do not remember the first dish I had. However, I do remember as a child how much I enjoyed Jollof rice. I remember my whole face being a bright shade of red from eating it and I remember seeing pictures of myself with a bright red face from eating the peppery rice.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>What’s your favourite Nigerian dish?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>My favourite Nigerian dish isn’t a typical Bini dish; (please, forgive me all the Bini people reading this who may think I have abandoned them. I have not). I just haven’t tasted anything as nice as Owo and plantain. There is a wonderful woman at the headquarters of Church of God Mission, her name is Mama Daibo, and she makes the best Owo and plantain. In fact, it is so delicious that I could eat it morning, noon and night, 365 days a year.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Have you heard and tasted Black soup, a popular delicacy in Benin? What was your first impression when you heard the name?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I love Black soup! It’s not my favourite dish, but it is in my top five. In fact, I looked forward to times where someone would give birth because we would always take Black soup to them at the hospital and I’d always have the chef make some extra for us. The name and taste never scared me. I liked it from the first day. I think it is also very rich in nutrients.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>What’s your favourite attire?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I love all Nigerian attire. I’ll start with my least favourite, which is tying wrappers and ‘Buba’ because I am always afraid that they might fall off me. I love making skirts and blouses, ankara, lace and bubus.</p>

          <i>As a Director of the Campus Life Division, Benson Idahosa University, what are your thoughts about sexual harassment in higher institutions in Nigeria and how can it be addressed?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>As a Director of the Campus Life Division in the Benson Idahosa University, sexual harassment is an important issue that must be dealt with in all universities in Nigeria and across the world. Anywhere you have a person in authority, you will find the potential for abuse of power and that’s what sexual abuse is when it comes to relationships between lecturers and their students.</p>
      <p>I believe the way to tackle this problem is to create safe, interactive forums for victims to express their concerns, fears and challenges. A great many times, people tend to mismanage or abuse their power and influence either because they were once victims themselves or because it’s been seen as a norm over time. I also believe that strong sanctions should be implemented to curtail such behaviour.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Do you believe there are fake miracles?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I believe there are people who pretend to have experienced miracles.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>What are your thoughts about fake pastors, prophets and miracles when you read or hear about them?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I believe that there are also so-called men of God who profess to have divine gifts or powers, who are just simply good entertainers. The Bible had told us this long before it began to manifest. It warned us of wolves in sheep clothing, people who come in the name of Jesus but operate under strange powers. What we’re seeing now is just Biblical prophecy playing out.</p>
      <p>It breaks my heart to see these things—people bringing such shame to the name of Jesus because the name of Jesus is so powerful in itself. You do not have to pretend or create a mirage. You just have to call on his name and he answers. It is unfortunate that people have been so carried away by the entertainment side of Christianity and ministry that they’ve forgotten where the power truly lies and that’s in the name of Jesus.</p>
      <p>In order to be a good Christian, you need to have a personal relationship with Christ. It’s not about the things which you do but rather, it starts with your heart. In Romans 10: 9 -10, it talks about making a total confession that Jesus Christ truly is the lord of your life. Giving him lordship of your life is the first step in being a good Christian and from that point, you become a new creation, your mind starts to become renewed and you can understand the principles of the Bible.</p>
