      <p>HAVANA (AP) - Thousands of young Cubans packed a Havana arena to witness a small step forward in the tumultuous relationship between one of the world’s last communist states and its small but vibrant private sector.</p>
      <p>The four-year-old fashion label Clandestina on Friday night debuted a new collection, based on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cuba/">Cuba</a>’s legacy of international athletic achievement, in the Ramon Fonst arena in Havana’s Revolution Plaza, home to the most powerful Cuban state institutions.</p>
      <p>Runway models included stars from the glory days of Cuban amateur sports, including world record high jumper <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/javier-sotomayor/">Javier Sotomayor</a>, Olympic champion runner Ana Fidelia Quirot and Regla Torres, considered by many to be the best female volleyball player in history.</p>
      <p>The Cuban private sector is legal but highly restricted by law, thickets of bureaucracy and official views of private enterprise as either a necessary evil, a potential threat to the socialist system, or both.</p>
      <p>Despite that, Clandestina was able to win permission to debut its 2020 “Glories of Sports” collection in the 4,000-seat Fonst arena, with the participation of athletes seen as national heroes, in a sign that at least some members of Cuban officialdom are increasingly accepting the legitimacy of private enterprise. Admission to the public was free.</p>

      <p>“This couldn’t have been done in the past in Cuba,” said Clandestina designer Gabriel Lara. “This is all a process that comes out of entrepreneurship in Cuba and this today is very favorable for us and for our customers. This, today, is an advance.”</p>
      <p>Cuban first lady Lis Cuesta has become a quiet, high-profile promoter of Cuba’s private sector. When Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, visited Cuba, Cuesta hosted a tasting of offers from private restaurants.</p>
      <p>During a visit by the Spanish royal family this month, she wore a dress made by Dador, another small, private Cuban fashion label.</p>
      <p>The Clandestina collection’s theme appeared wisely chosen - pride in the nation’s sports glory is common to virtually all Cubans regardless of their attitudes toward the government or political beliefs.</p>

        <p>“Even though they’re a private business, they’re doing work that shows our nation’s dignity and being private or state-run isn’t relevant,” Quirós said. “It doesn’t matter. They represent Cuba and the Cuban people.”</p>
