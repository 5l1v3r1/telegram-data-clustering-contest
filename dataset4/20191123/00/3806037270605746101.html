      <p>Currently promoting and supporting his newly-released collaborative project with <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/03-greedo">03 Greedo</a>, <i>Netflix &amp; Deal</i>, <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/kenny-beats">Kenny Beats</a> stops by our offices for the latest entry in our <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/conversations-with"><i>Conversations With</i></a> series. Specifically, the talented producer uses his <i>Conversations With</i> interview as a platform to reveal his full range of thoughts on 03 Greedo, including what it was like to work with him in the studio and the creative process behind <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/03-greedo-kenny-beats-netflix-and-deal-album-stream"><i>Netflix &amp; Deal</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“I gotta do right by him [03 Greedo] now; I gotta put this music out; I gotta make sure it gets heard the right way; I gotta make sure everybody that understands the content of Greedo understands it,” Kenny Beats tells us. “‘Sweet Lady’ and ‘Rude’ were songs that were getting play in every car, every party, every studio that I went to … As soon as I heard it, I connected with it for whatever reason … any time there was a lull in a studio session, I would just put on a Greedo song with other people.”</p>
      <p>Kenny Beats and 03 Greedo’s <i>Netflix &amp; Deal</i> album is made up of 13 new tracks from the pair, with additional contributions from Vince Staples, Freddie Gibbs, Maxo Kream, OhGeesy, Key! and Buddy. The aforementioned duo’s LP serves as the follow-up to 03 Greedo and Travis Barker’s <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/7/03-greedo-travis-barker-meet-the-drummers-ep-stream"><i>Meet the Drummers</i> EP</a>, which debuted back in July. During the full-length’s “making of” documentary, 03 Greedo says that <i>Netflix &amp; Deal</i>‘s themes and narrative take their inspiration from the films that he used to watch while hustling in Atlanta.</p>
