      <p>The stock market declined several days last week, but rebounded on Friday, which minimized the week’s losses. Once again, the cause of the rebound was encouraging news that a so-called “phase one” deal with China is looking more likely. Of course, there is a healthy degree of skepticism about whether a deal will really happen, or if it will mean anything. The Senate’s passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act last week is also complicating the situation.</p>

      <p>For the week, the Dow Jones Utility Average ($UTIL) was up 0.42%, followed by a 0.24% gain in the iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap (IJR). The Dow Jones Transportation Average ($TRAN) was the weakest, down 0.92%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NDX) was down 0.65% and a bit weaker than either the S&amp;P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p>
      <p>Last week’s FOMC minutes, from the October meeting, had little impact on the markets for a change, as they are clearly taking a neutral policy outlook. Thursday’s Philadelphia Fed Business Outlook Survey came in at 10.4, much better than the expected 7.0, as new orders were very strong. Also beating estimates was the November Consumer Sentiment at 96.8, which was the best reading since July.</p>
      <p>One economic data report that I find to be the most valuable is the Conference Board Leading Economic Index (LEI). Doug Short and Jill Mislinski of Advisor Perspectives have done some excellent research and analysis on this indicator. Their <a href="https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2019/11/22/conference-board-leading-economic-index-down-for-third-consecutive-month">latest report</a>, which came out Friday, notes that the LEI has declined for the third month in a row and includes their extensive analysis of the data.</p>

        <figcaption>LEI<cite>www.Advisorsperspectives.com</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Their chart reveals how the LEI has turned down prior to past recessions. In a <a href="https://www.conference-board.org/pdf_free/economics/BCI_Feb_Essay.pdf">February 2010 Conference Board report</a>, Conference Board's economists conclude that “December 2006 was identified as the cyclical peak of the LEI in the last business cycle”. That was a full year before the start of the recession. Clearly the LEI should be watched closely in the months ahead as the Conference Board commented in its November press release that the “six-month growth rate turned negative for the first time since May 2016”.</p>

      <p>Though there are no signs of a recession from the other economic reports that I follow, there has been an increase in the number of initial unemployment claims over the past five months. The initial unemployment claims this past week were unchanged from the week prior, but they are at the highest level since June 22.</p>
      <p>The chart above shows a 4-week Moving Average of initial unemployment claims. The downtrend from the January 2018 highs (line b) has just been overcome, as the average of claims rose 5,250 between the October and November survey weeks. The longer-term downtrend (line a) goes back to 2015 and is in the 250,000 area. If initial unemployment claims continue to increase in the months ahead, we may start to see an impact of these numbers in other data, most importantly Consumer Sentiment.</p>
      <p>Despite the holiday-shortened week there is a full economic calendar next week. The Chicago Fed National Activity Index and Dallas Fed Manufacturing Survey on Monday and the Consumer Confidence, the S&amp;P Corelogic Case-Shiller Housing Price Index, and New Home Sales on Tuesday. The second estimate for the 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter GDP and Durable Goods are out on Wednesday along with Pending Home Sales. On Friday we get the Chicago PMI.</p>

        <figcaption>Yield<cite>TomAspray - ViperReport.com</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>These reports are likely to have an impact on yields. The 10-Year T-Note yields peaked at 1.971% on November 7, which was just a few days before <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspray/2019/11/11/how-much-higher-can-yields-go/">my weekend post</a> questioning how much higher yields could go. The uptrend on the daily chart is now at 1.632%. A decisive drop below this level should confirm that the rally from the August low in yields was just a pause in the major downtrend. The daily Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and MACD-Histogram turned negative last Monday, which favors a further decline in yields.</p>

        <figcaption>NYSE<cite>TomAspray - ViperReport.com</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The daily chart of the NYSE Composite shows that it closed lower Monday through Thursday before gaining 0.26% on Friday to close at 13,441. The NYSE made a new rebound high at 13,508 on Tuesday, which is now first resistance. There is further at 13,637, which was the early 2018 high. The support to watch is the week’s low of 13,360.</p>
      <p>The daily NYSE All <a href="http://www.viperreport.com/ad-line-market-timing-stock-picking-trading/">Advance/Decline line</a> dropped below its Exponential Moving Average (EMA) with Thursday’s close, but Friday’s positive A/D numbers moved it back above its EMA. The NYSE Stocks Only A/D line shows a similar pattern, and both A/D lines failed to make new highs with prices (dashed lines). The A/D lines both show positive trends going back to the August and October lows. The weekly or intermediate-term A/D analysis has been positive since January 2019.</p>
      <p>This week’s action favors further new highs in the major averages, but it will be important that the daily A/D lines, like those on the NYSE, also make new highs. As of Friday’s close, only 65% of the S&amp;P 500 stocks were above their 50-day MA's. At the July market peak there were over 80% of the S&amp;P 500 stocks above their 50-day MA's, so there are clearly a number of stocks that have not yet participated in the market’s rally.</p>
