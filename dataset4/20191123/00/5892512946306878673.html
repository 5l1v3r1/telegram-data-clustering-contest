      <h1>Jorge Masvidal challenges Conor McGregor to UFC superfight: ‘Put your money where your mouth is’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:54:17+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 00:54</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Hiergesell</a></address>
      <p>A superfight between Conor McGregor and Jorge Masvidal would be absolutely massive, which is why both fighters continue to hint at a potential showdown in 2020.</p>
      <p>Masvidal, who has produced memorable knockout wins over Nate Diaz, Ben Askren, and Darren Till all within the past eight months, is one of the biggest stars in the sport today. The veteran’s ascension may have taken much longer than expected, but his recent <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/1/20944261/pic-bmf-belt-revealed-ufc-244-main-event-50k-well-spent-mma">“BMF” title</a> win over Diaz at UFC 244 in New York helped propel “Gamebred” to new heights. So much so that Masvidal is expected to pull the strings on his own career entering next year.</p>
      <p>McGregor, on the other hand, remains the biggest name in MMA today. Despite his inactivity and <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/1/20943536/ufc-conor-mcgregor-avoids-jail-time-following-guilty-plea-dublin-pub-punch-mma">out-of-cage antics</a>, the Irish superstar is still UFC’s most prizes possession. Once he <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/10/24/20930208/conor-mcgregor-ufc-comeback-fight-booked-jan-18-las-vegas-mma">returns to action early next year</a> the promotion will be able to take its new deal with ESPN to even greater heights.</p>
      <p>So will McGregor end up fighting Masvidal in his comeback fight?</p>
      <p>While UFC president Dana White believes <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/7/17/20697826/white-returning-conor-mcgregor-too-small-jorge-masvidal-wont-get-winner-ufc-242-khabib-poirier-mma">“Notorious” may be too small for Masvidal</a> at 170 pounds that hasn’t necessarily stopped McGregor from throwing the idea out there. Not only did McGregor request a <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/3/20947220/ufc-244-mcgregor-asks-for-the-three-piece-and-soda-masvidal-fight">“three piece with soda”</a> after Masvidal’s victory over Diaz at UFC 244 earlier this month, but “Notorious” recently said he’d fight all the top options entering next year, which just so happens to include Masvidal.</p>
      <p>ESPN MMA posted the following breakdown to <a href="https://twitter.com/espnmma/status/1197952527297392640">Twitter</a> earlier today showing the best matchups to make in 2020 and McGregor was quick to respond.</p>

      <p>“I’ll go at anyone on that list,” wrote McGregor.</p>
      <p>Masvidal, who is game to <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/12/20962006/ufc-jorge-masvidal-nick-diaz-callout-does-he-know-who-hes-asking-to-fight-mma">fight just about anybody these days</a>, wasted little time chiming in and challenging McGregor to a massive superfight.</p>

      <p>“Put your money where your mouth is,” wrote Masvidal. “I’m the only 1.”</p>
      <p>If that wasn’t a direct challenge then I don’t know what is.</p>
      <p>While fight fans would love the chance to see McGregor return to the Octagon against the hottest fighter in the sport today, “Notorious” has already been linked to a meeting with Donald “Cowboy” Cerrone. But considering McGregor is a master negotiator capable of smoothing over White’s biggest concerns, there’s a really good chance the former two-division UFC champion lobbies for a superfight with “Gamebred” and ends up getting what he wants.</p>
      <p>Until then, let the speculation take over!</p>
