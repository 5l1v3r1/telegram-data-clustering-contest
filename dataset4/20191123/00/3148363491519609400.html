      <p>The track, simply titled “Guns,” is a folk song and the released portions of it are acoustic. NME <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/listen-to-a-snippet-of-a-new-coldplay-song-guns-2565348#zcHKqm6URhyrww5L.99">published</a> a summation of the political song’s lyrics thusly:</p>
      <blockquote>“Everyday Life” reveals an anti-gun anthem which laments the fact that children “make pistols with their fingers and their thumbs.”</blockquote>
      <p>Genius.com <a href="https://genius.com/Coldplay-guns-lyrics">posted</a> song lyrics that come later in the track:</p>
      <blockquote>Take it from the playgrounds and take it from the bums<br/>Take it from the hospitals and squeeze it from the slums<br/>All the kids make pistols with their fingers and their thumbs<br/>Advertise a revolution, arm it when it comes<br/>We’re cooking up the zeros, we’ve been doing all the sums<br/>The judgment of this court is we need more guns Meltdown all the trumpets, all the trombones and the drums<br/>Who needs education or <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i>?<br/>Poor is good for business, cut the forests, they’re so dumb<br/>Only save your look-alikes and fuck the other ones<br/>It’s the opinion of this board that we need more guns</blockquote>

      <p>Earlier this week Breitbart news <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/11/21/coldplay-postpones-tour-for-environmental-concerns-wed-be-disappointed-if-its-not-carbon-neutral/">reported</a> that Coldplay was refusing to schedule a concert tour for the new album unless they were convinced it would not negatively impact the environment. The band’s lead singer Chris Martin explained, “Our next tour will be the best possible version of a tour like that environmentally. We would be disappointed if it’s not carbon neutral.”</p>
