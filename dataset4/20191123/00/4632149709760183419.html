      <p><i>Bengaluru’s very own EDM music festival FiveSixZero kicked off with a summit where stalwarts from the music and F&amp;B industry came together to discuss hot button issues<br/></i><br/>The third edition of the FiveSixZero music festival kicked off with a summit which brought together music producers, F&amp;B entrepreneurs, label executives and distributors, deejays and artistes on a common platform in engaging discussions ranging from nightlife in Bengaluru, creating music and content in the era of digital downloads and the growth of Indian music festivals. Inspired by the city’s postal code, FiveSixZero is a popular electronic dance music (EDM) festival which is an initiative of Times Red Cell. Curated by Nocturnal Networks, the festival is being held in association with Bangalore Mirror. <br/><br/>Grammy winner Ricky Kej opened the two-day summit on Friday, with a keynote address where he spoke about channelling the power of music for powerful causes. A passionate environmentalist, Kej played songs from his new album, Shanti Samsara – World Music for Environmental Consciousness, to highlight causes close to his heart. Using the example of the Kiribati archipelago in the south Pacific, which is under the threat of being submerged in the next 30 years, Kej played a snippet from his documentary on the island country. “Music can change mindsets from mere awareness to consciousness and action. It’s through the language of music that we can effect change in the world,” Kej said. <br/><br/>The following discussion saw panelists such as Kumar Manish, general manager, The Lalit (Kitty Ko), Chethan Hegde, owner of 1522 pub, Miguel Pardo, director, Pacha Group Ibiza and moderator Behram Siganporia (frontman of Best Kept Secret band) debate about the evolution of Bengaluru’s changing nightlife culture. As Siganporia rightly pointed out, Bengaluru is known as the electronic dance capital of India, however, that notion is being challenged due to the authorities clamping down on live performance spaces in the city. Hegde, who made an impassioned case on behalf of live music bar owners in the city, remarked rather ominously, “At the rate things are proceeding, nightlife in Bengaluru will be dead in six to eight months.” The only way ahead, as Manish observed, was for all the stakeholders (from standalone restaurant owners to larger establishments) to come together and engage with the authorities to work towards a solution. <br/><br/>One of the liveliest discussions at the summit centered around the creation of homegrown music festivals in India that have gained immense popularity over the years. Panellists such as Supreet Kaur, festival director Bacardi NH7 Weekender, OML, Brian Tellis, director Fountainhead Promotions &amp; Events and Tessa Sprangemeijer, project manager, Envie Event UAE, addressed issues such as the challenges of creating and running large-scale music fests. “Music festival culture has always existed in India but there has been a change in consumption patterns,” said Tellis, adding that in order to create a feasible model, they opted to create intellectual property for brands which they could own and grow. Case in point is the highly successful Mahindra Blues Festival which has gained global acclaim and attracts A-list talent. Both Kaur and Sprangemeijer touched upon the importance of building a community – both online and offline – through such events.</p>

      <p>Another hot topic of discussion that garnered several questions from the audience was about creating content in the era of digital downloads. David van Luijn, online marketing head – Armada, Stephen Dowler from Monstercat, Gurbax, DJ/producer and moderator Elixir Nahar, field marketing – Bumble, debated the pitfalls and highlights of the role social media plays in creating music. As Gurbax pointed out, “Today everyone feels empowered because of social media as it allows you to be seen and reach out to a wider audience. I know that I wouldn’t be where I was today without it.” Meanwhile, Luijn revealed that their highest audience engagement on social media comes from India and Mexico. “India is one of the most important markets for Armada,” he added. <br/><br/>The last session of the evening involved discussion on red tapism in the F&amp;B industry in Bengaluru and its impact on live music, livelihoods and the future of the music culture in the city. Tellis was joined by Amit Roy of ThinkTanc and SL Rajendra Prasad, additional excise commissioner, in a frank discussion on the current state of affairs and the path ahead. Despite the several challenges being faced by numerous bars and live music venues in the city, Prasad was hopeful that the situation would improve in the coming year. <br/><br/><br/>A masterclass by noted EDM photographer Rutger Geerling, which was held on the sidelines of the event, added a new dimension to the summit, allowing aspiring photographers key insights into the business.</p>
