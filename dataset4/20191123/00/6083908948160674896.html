      <h1>South Bend Councilman Rebukes Mayor Pete, Endorses Joe Biden</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://townhall.com/author/bronsonstocking" target="_blank">Bronson Stocking</a></address>
      <p>South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is running for president, but the city's longest-serving African American council member just endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden for president.</p>
      <p>“When the political winds are fiercely blowing across our country, it’s important for us to have an experienced leader who has been through the diverse storms of life to guide our country,” South Bend Councilmen Oliver Davis Jr. said in a statement.</p>
      <p>So a person who works hand-in-hand with the mayor and presumingly knows his leadership better than anyone else thinks the candidate lacks the experience to lead the nation, which is not surprising. As Mayor Pete has hit the campaign trail, violent crime has skyrocketed in his city. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/30/us/politics/pete-buttigieg-south-bend-police.html">Violent</a> crime in South Bend is more than double the average for a city of its size. As of July, violent crime is up nearly 18 percent over the same period the previous year. </p>
      <p>The gay white mayor hasn't given black Americans much reason to trust him. Buttigieg recently touted his "Douglas Plan" as a way of helping black Americans across the country. Buttigieg claimed to have 400 black South Carolinians endorsing the plan, but it was soon <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/timothymeads/2019/11/18/buttigieg-just-pulled-the-biggest-bull-crap-with-his-supposed-list-of-black-endorsements-n2556639">reported</a> that many of the so-called endorsers never actually endorsed the plan and 42 percent of the endorsements were actually white people. To make matters worse, Buttigieg's campaign used stock images of Kenyans on the campaign website to promote Buttigieg's plan. </p>
      <p>Davis told <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/22/black-south-bend-leader-endorses-biden-over-buttigieg-072885">Politico</a> that his struggle to attract support from the black community "has been a consistent issue that has not gone away.”</p>
      <p>Sorry Pete. Live by identity politics, die by identity politics.</p>
