        <b>Kings 97 (6-8), Nets 116 (7-8)</b>

      <p>
        <b>Spurs 104 (5-11), Sixers 115 (10-5)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Philly took the lead after the first 3 minutes and wouldn’t trail for the rest of the game.</p>

      <p>Anthony Davis dropped a game-high 33 points with 11 boards and 7 dimes. LeBron James added 23 points and 14 dimes and had an insane, one-handed catch (see below).</p>

        <b>Cavs 101 (4-11), Mavs 143 (10-5)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dallas completely housed the Cavs in the second and third quarters and shot an insane 20-37 from the three-point line.</p>
      <p>Luka Doncic finished with his third straight game of 30+ points, becoming the first Mav to accomplish the feat since Dirk Nowitzki in 2010. Luka finished with a game-high 30 points, 14 dimes, 7 boards and had a +21 plus/minus.</p>

        <b>Celtics 92 (11-4), Nuggets 96 (11-3)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite losing Kemba Walker to a head injury and trailing by 19 points in the third quarter, the Celtics battled back to nearly win the game.</p>
      <p>Denver would narrowly hold on, behind Nikola Jokic’s 18/16/10 triple-double. Jamal Murray added a game-high 22 points.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Warriors 109 (3-14), Jazz 113 (10-5)</b>

      <p>
        <b>Rockets 119 (11-5), Clippers 122 (11-5)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Paul George and Kawhi Leonard have played just two games as teammates, but both games were two of the best games all season.</p>
      <p>Kawhi, James Harden, Lou Williams, PG and Russell Westbrook all traded clutch buckets during a crazy fourth quarter. But it would be Kawhi who would hit the deciding, go-ahead shot.</p>
      <p>George finished with 19 points, 8 boards and 7 dimes. Leonard had 24 points, 6 boards and 3 steals. Williams added a team-high 26 points, all scored in the second half.</p>
