      <p><i>Illegal contractor dumped commercial waste on RBNAMS grounds<br/></i><br/>Beware of dumping garbage on roads, lakeside or footpaths as the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is on regular patrol to monitor dumping. The civic body is imposing fines on the offenders. <br/><br/>The BBMP, which has been chasing an unauthorised contractor who had been dumping commercial waste on RBNAMS grounds for a year and a half, has finally caught the offender and imposed a fine. The vehicle that was being used to dump waste has also been seized. The officials said that mixed waste from commercial establishments was being dumped on the road. The BBMP has imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on the Lemon Tree Hotel for not ensuring that the waste was being managed as per the rules. BBMP officials informed that the hotel had tied up with a contractor, who had subleased the collection and dumping of waste to another contractor, Harish. They said that a contractor wasn’t permitted to sublease. <br/><br/><br/>Marshals had been trying to nab the offender during their night patrols. They were informed by the security guards in the area that waste was usually dumped between 11 pm and 3 am. At 2 am, on Friday, they caught the vehicle dumping waste. The drivers, who managed to escape initially, were caught on Dickenson Road later. The vehicle is currently at BBMP’s east zone office. Sarfaraz Khan, joint commissioner, solid waste management, BBMP, visited the spot along with other officials to enquire about the violation. <br/><br/>The BBMP officials said that more than 100 kg of commercial waste was dumped. Sarfaraz Khan said, “The CCTV cameras in the area were being monitored. People are <br/><br/>aware that marshals are deployed on night patrols. So, when a violator spots a BBMP vehicle or a marshal, they manage to escape.” <br/><br/>The officials also booked a meat shop owner in Varthur and imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh. The shop owner was dumping poultry waste near the lake, which is monitored by the High Court and National Green Tribunal.</p>
