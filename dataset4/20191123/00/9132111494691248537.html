      <p>Leader of the Homeland Study Group Foundation (HSGF), Charles Komi Kudzordzi has sent a message, from his hideout to the Government of Ghana to desist from sending security personnel after him, and invite him for talks through his legal representatives.</p>
      <p>The Ho District Court ordered the arrest of Charles Kwame Kudzordzi and some members of his foundation for “unlawful” declaration of the Volta region as a sovereign state – Western Togoland Separatist Movement</p>
      <p>But the wanted separatist movement leader in his video message said he is willing to avail himself on condition that his lawyers are involved and his security assured.</p>
      <p>“If government feels I should come back for the case to continue, I am free to do so through my lawyers, but to look for me, I don’t know what they are going to do with me…human as I am, I will not present myself.</p>
      <p>“I am in the country anyway, I have not travelled or hidden anywhere, but I want the government to show maturity, invite me legally through my lawyers and I will present myself for the case to continue,” Charles Komi Judjordzi said in the video.</p>
      <p>He also chastised government for snooping around his house with security personnel and arresting some members of his family and his supporters.</p>
      <p>“What has started happening is not the right thing, going around arresting people in the street, taking them and locking them up in cells and also going into the houses of individuals particularly mine and taking my 70-year old wife and locking her up…no, that is not the right thing.”</p>
      <p>He, however, called for calm amongst his people who form the Western Togoland, charging them to not engage in any attack in order to ensure that peace prevails.</p>
      <p>‘We want to set a record for peace to prevail so that the whole world will know that we are peace-loving people,” he emphasized.</p>

        <b>Separatist Movement and Independence</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Homeland Study Group Foundation (HSGF) has been set on restoring the Western Togoland as an independent state for some time now.</p>
      <p>In May this year, the group attempted making the declaration, but security forces got wind of it and stopped them.</p>
      <p>The leadership were subsequently arrested but later released.</p>
      <p>Last Saturday, November 16, the group declared the Western Togoland which comprises of the Oti Region, Volta Region and parts of the Northern region as an independent state.</p>
      <p>Following this declaration, the police declared the group wanted while making efforts to arrest its leadership.</p>
      <p>The leader of the group Charles Komi Kudjordzi who is on the run is now telling government through the video making rounds the only way he will make himself available is if he is invited through his legal representatives.</p>
