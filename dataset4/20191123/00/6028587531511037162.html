      <p>It’s that time of year again, so let the races begin. Black Friday is the official kickoff to the holiday shopping season and Americans are expected to spend roughly $730 billion this holiday season, up about 4% from last year, according to the National Retail Federation. To make the most of this year’s shopping extravaganza, you need to come prepared. Below are ten tips to get the best deals while still spending responsible.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Make a budget! Just because there are sales doesn’t mean you get a pass to blow through your savings. The very first thing you should do is decide exactly how much you are willing to spend over the sale weekend.</li>
        <li>Make a list of what you want to buy to avoid impulse buying. The deals are tempting but remember, if it’s not something you need to get, buying it on sale doesn’t mean you are actually saving money.</li>
        <li>Research prices now on the items you want to buy. When the sales start, check to make sure it’s actually a real discount. Not all Black Friday deals are good ones.</li>
        <li>Speaking of waiting - don’t ‘panic purchase’. Shoppers will be inundated with “Sale ends soon!” and “Limited quantities available!”. Don’t buy something you’re unsure of just because you’re scared to miss the deal. Think through all your purchases and don’t stress too much. Although many of the big sale items run out early, there are advantages to waiting until later in the day. You may be able to catch an additional discount at the end of the sale for those items that didn’t sell. Plus, there’s always Cyber Monday and stores continue to discount throughout the season, so it may make sense to wait.</li>
        <li>Although most deals are just an online click away, the stores that offer limited amounts of their major doorbusters will run out out of those items quickly. For these discounts, it’s best to be at the store in person, and early.</li>
        <li>Be vigilant about security. In all the shopping craziness, it’s easy to get swept away onto sites you don’t typically shop on to chase a deal. When you visit a new e-commerce website, make sure the payments are secure.</li>
        <li>Use this time to be proactive. Don’t limit the shopping to just the holidays. If you have birthdays or weddings coming up over the next few months, the Friday deals are a great opportunity to save some money on those gifts.</li>
        <li>Comparison shop. Black Friday is like any other shopping experience; do your research to make sure you’re really getting the best deal out there.</li>
        <li>For the stores and brands you like, check out their social media pages now. This is where you can find special deals for their followers and fans, discount codes and details on their upcoming sales.</li>
        <li>Start early. I don’t mean standing outside of Target at 4am (although many do this!). I mean start looking around for sales on Thanksgiving day - many retailers start their discounting during the days before Black Friday.</li>
      </ol>
