      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:19:11+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 00:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>Members of the Left parties and the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> on Friday sparred in Rajya Sabha over the protests by <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/jawaharlal-nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> University students against a hike in hostel fees and a draft hostel manual which imposes dress codes and curfew timings.</p>
      <p>Through a Zero Hour mention, K K Ragesh of the CPI(M) raised the matter and sought a judicial probe into police action against agitating students.</p>
      <p>Immediately after this, Prabhat Jha of the BJP raised the issue of the “defacement” of a yet-to-be-unveiled statue of Swami Vivekananda on JNU campus. He then went on to raise the issue of the alleged anti-India slogans raised by JNU students and demanded the Central government’s oversight of activities in JNU. This was strongly countered by Left members.</p>
      <p>Ragesh said JNU students have been protesting for over one month, demanding the roll back of the fee hike and restoration of democratic rights on campus.</p>
      <p>He asked why civil liberties were being “suppressed” after declaring an “undeclared emergency”. As he demanded a judicial probe into the police action on the students, Chairman M <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/venkaiah-naidu">Venkaiah Naidu</a> cut him short, saying he had not spoken on the fee hike, which was the subject admitted.</p>
      <p>After Jha had spoken, Naidu said that only the submission on the JNU fee hike and the defacement of the Vivekananda statue was admitted.</p>
