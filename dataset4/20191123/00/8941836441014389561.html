      <p>BREMERTON, Wash. (AP) - A man found guilty of hiding the body of a man after he was killed in a 2015 home invasion has had his conviction tossed by the state Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>The Kitsap Sun reports justices this week sided with a lower court, which last year found Kitsap County prosecutors failed to properly put Arnold Mafnas Cruz on notice for the charge of rendering criminal assistance.</p>
      <p>Cruz claimed on appeal that the documents used to charge him with the crime did not contain the required language, making them “constitutionally deficient.” Both the state Division I Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court agreed, writing that the people accused of crimes have a right to know the charges against them.</p>
      <p>Cruz was accused of being called after Robert Hood’s death to help cover up the crime.</p>
      <p>The court’s action sends Cruz’s case back to Kitsap County Superior Court.</p>
