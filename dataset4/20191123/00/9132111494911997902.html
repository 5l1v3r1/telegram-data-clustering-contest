      <p>Former Local Government and Rural Development Minister under the erstwhile John Mahama administration, Hon. Alhaji Collins Dauda says he will campaign for ‘YES’ votes to decide on whether or not political parties should be allowed to sponsor candidates at district level elections.</p>
      <p>According to Collins Dauda, he disagrees with his party’s National Democratic Congress (NDC) position of a ‘NO’ vote to disallow political parties from being involved in local level elections.</p>
      <p>The MP made this disclosure in an interview with Kingdom 107.7 FM’s Bono Regional correspondent, Effa Yaw Katakyie</p>
      <p>He explained that ”political parties in Ghana are already involved in local level elections and therefore it would be hypocritical to vote “NO” for an already existing practice. ”</p>
      <p>Hon. Dauda who is also the MP for Asutifi South in the Ahafo region argued that the relationship between some MMDCE’s and their people is mostly not cordial but with the introduction of constituents electing their MMDCE’s will improve this relationship.</p>
      <p>The referendum is to ensure a political party participation in the local governance system.</p>
      <p>According to the NDC, a “YES” vote will further polarize the nation, particularly local communities along the lines of NPP / NDC, and will likely lead to the creation of “NDC Communal Labour day” and “NPP Communal Labour day”, as well as “NDC market” and “NPP market”.</p>
      <p>To the NDC, there was deliberate misinformation in the public domain that voting “YES” in the referendum was a decision that Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives would now be elected.</p>
      <p>Background</p>
      <p>The referendum seeks to amend the constitution to give electorates the power to elect directly their own Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives.</p>
      <p>According to President Akufo-Addo, the District Assembly concept “has led to the enhancement of participatory involvement of our people in their local government. Now, it is time to deepen the process that began 31 years ago, and entrust to the people full sovereignty over the election of the MMDCEs and members of the District Assemblies”.</p>
      <p>Voting ‘YES’ would politicize the local governance system against the entrenched clause Article 55(3) of the 1992 Constitution.</p>
      <p>The clause states that: “Subject to the provisions of this Article, a political party is free to participate in shaping the political will of the people, to disseminate information on political ideas, social and economic programmes of a national character, and sponsor candidates for elections to any public office other than to District Assemblies or lower local government units.”</p>
