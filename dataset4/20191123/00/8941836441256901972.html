      <h1>US military loses drone over Libyan capital</h1>

      <p>CAIRO (AP) - The U.S. military said Friday it lost an unmanned drone aircraft over <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tripoli/">the Libyan capital</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tripoli/">Tripoli</a>, where rival armed groups have been fighting for control of the city for months.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Africa Command said the drone was lost Thursday while assessing the security situation and monitoring extremist activity.</p>
      <p>AFRICOM did not give a reason for the drone’s loss, but said it was investigating. It said drone operations in Libya were “fully coordinated with appropriate government officials.”</p>
      <p>Since 2015, Libya has been divided between two governments, one based in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tripoli/">Tripoli</a> and the other in the country’s east. Forces loyal to the eastern government have been trying to wrest control of the capital since April.</p>
      <p>An Italian drone was shot down Wednesday southeast of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tripoli/">Tripoli</a> by forces loyal to the eastern government.</p>
