      <h1>Joe Schmidt On The Most Disappointing Aspect Of Ireland's World Cup Failure</h1>

      <p>Former Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt has elaborated on his immense disappointment after the World Cup quarter-final loss.</p>
      <p>Ireland suffered yet again last eight exit last month, this time at the hands of New Zealand. It ensures the record of never reaching a semi-final continues and for Schmidt, this was particularly dispiriting for the fans.</p>

      <p>Speaking on RTE One's Late Late Show, Schmidt said it was tough to take.</p>
      <p>"I am probably my own worst critic. I can see why people are upset or disappointed particularly by that last performance in the World Cup because I was every bit as disappointed as were the players. It has been hard to get over but time marches on.</p>
      <p>When asked does he give himself a hard time over Japan, he replied "Yes. I think so."</p>
      <p>"I don't know if any of the audience were there but just before the game when the All Blacks were doing the Haka, the Fields of Athenry was unbelievable.</p>
      <p>"You could not hear the Haka and they had microphones out for the Haka. The Fields of Athenry was incredible.</p>
      <blockquote>We had fantastic support. You are disappointed for yourself, but all those people have travelled over to support you. You are totally disappointed for them. I know a number of them had tickets for semi-finals as well.<br/>I don't know if you heard in the semi-final, but in one of the semi-finals, you could hear the Fields of Athenry.</blockquote>

      <p>The former Ireland coach was also surprised by Brian O'Driscoll during the interview, who paid tribute to the legacy.</p>
      <p>"Of course there is disappointment around the World Cup. We all want to get to that elusive semi-final and we will get there at some point. But let's not lose sight of what went on before that. Beating the All Blacks for the first time.</p>
      <p>"We waited 61 years for a Grand Slam in 2009. We only had to wait another nine or ten thanks to that group of players and Joe. There has been so much great stuff."</p>
