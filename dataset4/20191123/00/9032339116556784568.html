      <p>Maggie Hewitt launched Maggie Marilyn out of New Zealand in 2016 and made a name for herself in the crowded fashion space both for her exuberant, playful yet sophisticated, whimsical designs and her own contagious youth and exuberance. She also put sustainability at the forefront of her business before it was fashionable to do so, a "trend" in the industry that has quickly caught on. While creating pieces that don't harm the environment or the people who wear them should never be a trend, it seems to have only become a true industry conversation in the last year or so. And Hewitt is already onto her next step, a new line of basics she's calling Somewhere.</p>
      <p>Somewhere was designed to hit three main points: luxury quality, seasonless style, and perfect fit. "After my trip to Paris in February 2018, my world was spinning so fast and all I craved that feeling of simplicity, of being home, and of being dressed in pieces like what I wore growing up; singlets t-shirts, singlets, jeans , hoodies and leggings," the designer explained in a speech at a dinner for the launch of this new category. "I had made dresses to make me dream and colorful tops to lift my spirit but I was missing those simplistic pieces that made me feel at home. So when it came to designing Somewhere, my personal journey, along with our design principle of seasonless style, converged to become what is now our Somewhere offering."</p>

      <p>Somewhere is created out of three fabrics: organic cotton, New Zealand merino wool (both natural fibers which can be recycled and/or composted), and regenerated nylon, made from plastics redirected from landfill and oceans and turned into fabric, which can itself be recycled. The 9-piece collection also comes in at a lower price point than her main line. Somewhere's retail prices start at $45 for a tank top, up to $420 for a blazer, while Maggie Marilyn's main pieces retail between $150 and $2,195 for colorful statement pieces.</p>
      <p>Somewhere is also founded on the idea of circularity. The aim is always to encourage people to keep their clothing for as long as possible, even if it's not a large investment piece."If, over time, people fall out of love with their garments, when sent back to our NZ headquarters, we will have it recycled and turned into new items, creating a waste free, landfill free fashion system."</p>
      <p>The collection is being sold on <a href="https://maggiemarilyn.com/collections/somewhere">maggiemarilyn.com</a> starting today.</p>
