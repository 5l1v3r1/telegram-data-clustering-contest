      <h1>How To Improve Air Quality In Your Home</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Noma Nazish</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/24/climate/air-pollution-increase.html">rising levels</a> of outdoor air pollution, spurred by factors like vehicle emissions, fossil fuel burning and industrial exhaust gases, is worrying enough to make you want to stay indoors as much as possible. But surprisingly, even the indoor air isn't exactly as clean and healthy as we'd like to believe. In fact, according to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/report-environment/indoor-air-quality#note2">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a>, indoor air can often be two to five times more polluted than outdoor air. "On average, we spend <a href="https://www.epa.gov/report-environment/indoor-air-quality#note2">around 90% of our time</a> indoors. So, it's important to keep our indoor air as clean as possible, especially during winter months when we like to keep our windows and doors shut tight to seal out the cold," says Abby Lemon, application engineer at <a href="https://www.filtrete.com/3M/en_US/filtrete/products/~/Filtrete-Products/Air-Filtration/?N=4315+7568680+3294529207+3294857497&amp;rt=r3">Filtrete</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What causes indoor air pollution?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The most common sources of indoor air pollution include asbestos, carbon monoxide emissions from central heating systems and gas stoves, radon, mold, tobacco smoke and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in household items like disinfectants, air fresheners, paint, carpeting, adhesives, pesticides and wood preservatives.</p>
      <p>Inadequate ventilation can also contribute to indoor air pollution by trapping the allergens and pollutants inside and keeping the outdoor air from diluting emissions caused by the pollutants, says <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/introduction-indoor-air-quality">EPA</a>. "High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants," it adds.</p>
      <p>"Living near a busy road can also affect the indoor air quality as the pollutants from car exhaust can enter your home," says <a href="https://www.entandallergy.com/doctor/payel-gupta-md">Dr. Payel Gupta</a>, assistant clinical professor at SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn and spokesperson for the <a href="https://www.lung.org/">American Lung Association</a>.</p>
      <p>"Since many of these pollutants are odorless, you won't know that something is wrong until you start experiencing symptoms," she points out.</p>
      <p>If you want to check how safe the air is inside your home, here's a handy guide to measuring indoor air quality. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>How does polluted indoor air affect your health?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Common short-term effects of indoor air pollution include dryness and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, and skin, headaches, fatigue, shortness of breath, hypersensitivity and allergies, sinus congestion, coughing, sneezing, even dizziness, tells Dr. Gupta.</p>
      <p>The likelihood of an immediate reaction to indoor air pollutants depends on several factors including the individual's age and whether they have any pre-existing medical conditions, notes <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/introduction-indoor-air-quality">EPA</a>. For instance, people with asthma and allergies are more sensitive and therefore may experience more severe symptoms as compared to those who don't have asthma or allergies.  </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, other potential health problems may develop after long or repeated periods of exposure. These long-term effects include worsening respiratory disease (asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchitis), heart disease, lung cancer and premature death, says Dr. Gupta. "Prolonged exposure to polluted indoor air has also been linked to low birth weight infants," she adds.</p>
      <p>
        <b>So, what can you do to improve the indoor air quality of your home?</b>
      </p>
      <p>While toxic indoor air has become a serious problem today, the good news is that it can be effectively managed with the right tools and techniques. Here are eight simple ways to purify the air in your home:</p>
      <p><b>Get to the source.</b> One of the most effective ways to curb indoor air pollution is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. "This includes using non-toxic extermination methods to get rid of pests, having floors with minimal carpeting to reduce dust mites, washing linen in hot water, cleaning rugs and carpets with a <a href="https://www.explainthatstuff.com/hepafilters.html">HEPA filter</a> vacuum cleaner at least once a week and using non-toxic, fragrance-free household cleaners," tells Dr. Gupta. You can further combat air pollution by switching to essential oil diffusers instead of air fresheners and adjusting gas stove and installing a kitchen ventilation system to reduce the amount of emissions. In addition, "remove your shoes when you get home to make sure that you're not tracking pollen or other allergy triggers into the home," says Lemon.</p>
      <p><b>Reduce exposure to carbon monoxide.</b> Heating equipment such as unvented kerosene heaters, wood stoves, gas water heaters and central heating systems are some of the most common sources of carbon monoxide emissions indoors. Leaking chimneys and furnaces can further pump carbon monoxide inside your home. This is why it's important to ensure that all combustion equipment are maintained and properly adjusted to minimize toxic fumes. Make sure that the doors on all wood stoves fit tightly and have a trained professional inspect, clean and tune-up central heating system (furnaces, flues and chimneys) once every year, suggests <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/carbon-monoxides-impact-indoor-air-quality">EPA</a>. Also, open flues when using a fireplace and choose a wood stove that's certified to meet EPA emission standards, it adds. "Having a carbon monoxide monitor is also useful to track levels of this odorless gas in your home," says Dr. Gupta. </p>
      <p><b>Eliminate mold.</b> Exposure to mold can lead to a number of health problems such as wheezing, sore throat, skin rashes, watery eyes and headaches. The best way to get rid of mold is to manage the humidity levels in your home, particularly in areas like the kitchen and washrooms. "Turn on the exhaust fan in the bathroom immediately after bathing to help remove the humidity from the room," suggests Lemon. Here are a few more tips on <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-get-rid-of-mold-4163846">how to remove mold</a> from every home surface.</p>
      <p><b>Monitor radon levels.</b> Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas. Inhaling radon is the leading cause of lung cancer among non-smokers and the second most common cause of lung cancer in general, states <a href="https://www.epa.gov/radon/health-risk-radon">EPA</a>. Since it's odorless and colorless, testing is the only way to determine and reduce radon levels in your house. EPA suggests installing a radon reduction system and getting the cost estimate from one or more qualified radon mitigation contractors. It usually costs the same as other common home repairs. Though the exact cost may vary depending on the size and design of your home and which radon reduction methods are needed, says <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-02/documents/2013_consumers_guide_to_radon_reduction.pdf">EPA</a>. If you're a tenant, here's a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/radon/radon-guide-tenants">quick guide</a> on how to measure and fix high radon levels in your rented space.  </p>
      <p><b>Increase ventilation. </b>"Proper ventilation allows harmful air pollutants and allergens to circulate outside thereby limiting your exposure to it," says Dr. Gupta. Even in the cold months, open windows and turn on window or attic fans from time to time to allow fresh air to move into the house, suggests <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/improving-indoor-air-quality">EPA</a>. "However, if you live near a highway or a busy road, avoid opening your windows during early morning hours and during the traffic rush hours," tells Dr. Gupta.  </p>
      <p><b>Groom your pets regularly.</b> Pet dander (ie; dead skin cells shed by an animal) is another common culprit behind indoor air pollution. If you're a pet parent, make sure you properly brush your pet's coat regularly and vacuum all the carpeting, floors and furnishings using a vacuum cleaner with HEPA filter. </p>
      <p><b>Invest in an air purifier.</b> Using air purifiers is another effective way to tackle stale indoor air. "You can place them in commonly used rooms, like in the living room, kitchen and bedrooms, to help ventilate and clean the air in these spaces," says Lemon. Here's the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/air-cleaners-and-air-filters-home#types-of-pollutants">EPA guide</a> on how to choose the right air purifier for your home. You can also use certain houseplants to detoxify indoor air naturally. "Plants like peace lilies, snake plants, golden pothos, English ivy, Chinese evergreen and rubber plants are a great choice as they help purify the air by minimizing the effects of pollutants such as formaldehyde, ammonia and carbon monoxide," says Lemon. </p>
      <p><b>Change the filters.</b> If you have a forced-air heating system, it's important to <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/easy-ways-you-can-improve-indoor-air-quality">change the filters</a> on a regular basis. Additionally, "use a <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/air-filters/buying-guide/index.htm">high-performance air filter</a> that can help capture and trap even small particles and allergens–like pet dander, smoke, dust and viruses," says Lemon. </p>
