      <p>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - The Latest on a shooting outside a concert venue in Salt Lake City (all times local):</p>
      <p>5:50 a.m.</p>
      <p>Salt Lake City police say the three people shot outside a downtown concert venue are not cooperating with police.</p>
      <p>Lt. Carlos Valencia tells The Associated Press that two friends in their early 20s were shot at from a car Friday night outside The Complex, along with a juvenile who may or may not have been with the pair. One man was hit in the chest and the other was hit in the forearm. Valencia says the juvenile was hit in the foot by a ricochet.</p>
      <p>Valencia says the two men had a verbal confrontation with other males inside the venue, but it’s unclear whether that was related to the shooting. Valencia previously said one of the victims fired back at the car, but he now says it’s unclear who did so. He says no weapons were found on the three victims and witness accounts were inconsistent.</p>
