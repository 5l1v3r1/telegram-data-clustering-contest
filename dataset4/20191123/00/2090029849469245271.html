      <h3>Air Peace fraud: Allen Onyema charged for fraud â€“ Nigerians react:</h3>
      <p>From Adebayo Akintunde:</p>
      <blockquote>This one loud o. Falsifying documents. ðŸ™†ðŸ™†ðŸ™† | CEO of Nigerian airline, Air Peace, Allen Onyema, has been indicted for bank fraud and money laundering.</blockquote>
      <p>From Ayo Bankole:</p>
      <blockquote>Just when we are still celebrating our darling Allen Onyema, after his heroic rescue of Nigerians from Xenophobic South Africa, US Dept of Justice releases a damning report on allegations of fraud &amp; money laundering totalling $20m by Air Peace CEO. Urrgh!</blockquote>
      <p>From Gotti:</p>
      <blockquote>So Air Peace was built on fraud money!? Maaaadt! This Naija ehn both old n young dey do fraud. All those big offices n cars could just be a front for fraud.</blockquote>
      <p>From Akin Oyebode:</p>
      <blockquote>This reads like a pretty basic money laundering gig. DoJ is accusing him of setting up a phoney company (Springfield Aviation LLC) to receive money in the US and move it around, under the pretext of selling planes to Air Peace. Wild, but very basic.<br/><br/>Wonder where the alleged money came from. But thatâ€™s an easy scam to scatter. Buying planes from a company that has no history of dealing with airlines before you must raise some eyebrows. Anyway, gone with the wind. End.</blockquote>
      <p>From Toyin Fab:</p>
      <blockquote>Read again. Beginning in 2010. E don tey no be today. Itâ€™s very possible setting up Air peace was just to provide a front for the main business which is money laundering.</blockquote>
      <p>From Dr Kester Ozere:</p>
      <blockquote>Mehn!â€¦ I have read that write up from DOJ, Georgia against Allen Onyema, CEO AirPeace.<br/><br/>Theyâ€™re deep!<br/><br/>The US DOJs donâ€™t just writeâ€¦ Their write ups most times are product of detailed investigations.<br/><br/>I hope he survives thisâ€¦ ðŸ¤”</blockquote>
