        <b>Most honourable, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, my fellow MegaMart team members, friends of MegaMart, good evening. As one of the awardees I am happy for this opportunity to share with you some of my experiences at MegaMart.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Growing up, it was always my desire to work with a company like MegaMart. I remember each day I would pass the store in Portmore and I'd say, “Mi want to work at dat big building.”</p>
      <p>I got the opportunity in 2004 when I started working at MegaMart Portmore as a part-time receptionist/relief operator. I was eventually made a full-time receptionist. In 2006, I was promoted to the Accounts Department and began studying for my Associate Degree in Accounts and Finance.</p>
      <p>To say I've grown with the organisation is an understatement. I have been promoted four times within the Accounts Department and I continue to advance towards my personal goals. My 15 years with MegaMart has really been a roller-coaster ride but I have achieved much because my mottos have always been: “The brave may fall, but never yield,” and “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me!”</p>
      <p>I have accomplished a lot during my time with the company. I am married with two children, own my own home and I've managed to qualify for a Bachelor's Degree in Accounts and Finance.</p>
      <p>Many have asked how I managed to combine work, school, family and church so successfully. What I always say is, “If you want good, your nose have to run.”</p>
      <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I thank God for MegaMart. It has moulded me into the woman I am today: a mother, a wife and an accounting professional. MegaMart has taught me how to stand up and work hard to achieve my goals. If I can make it, I know anyone can, because with God all things are possible.</p>
      <p>To Mr Gassan Azan Jr and all the MegaMart team, I say a special thank you, and I say thanks to everyone who has turned out this evening to support us on this very special occasion.</p>
