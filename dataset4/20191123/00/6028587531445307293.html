      <p>Apple and Microsoft, two of the most successful companies on the planet, have had more than their share of failures. Together, they have probably had enough failures to put entire countries out of business. They put a lot of people and money into what ended up as failed efforts. Apple invested quite a bit into its <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1418-biggest-apple-fails.html">Newton MessagePad</a>, and does anyone remember <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1418-biggest-apple-fails.html">Macintosh TV</a>? Microsoft also had misses among its many hits, including <a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/microsoft/106694-the-biggest-microsoft-failures-ever">Microsoft Kin</a>, <a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/microsoft/106694-the-biggest-microsoft-failures-ever">Windows Vista</a>, and the much-maligned <a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/microsoft/106694-the-biggest-microsoft-failures-ever">Clippy</a>. Of course, Apple and Microsoft could afford to learn from their failures – with costs that exceeded the total revenues of many mid-sized companies – and adapt their learnings into future successes. Apple’s Newton, for example, pioneered the path to personal digital assistants, which eventually morphed into today’s smartphones.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, most mainstream companies don’t have huge reserves of cash in their bank accounts to learn such costly lessons. For them, innovation is risky and expensive. It’s often hard to stay ahead of customer trends. A bet-the-business venture may fall flat, and take the entire business down with it.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t have to be this way. With today’s technology – especially cloud and data analytics – experimentation is much cheaper and smarter. A company can conduct discrete, virtualized and productive tests based on small samples, for example, rather than risking spectacular debacles in public view.</p>
      <p>The big web properties – Amazon, eBay, and yes, Apple and Microsoft – have learned to master the art of virtual or data-driven experimentation, conducting hundreds of experiments a day on everything from screen colors to product features. Still, most mainstream organizations haven’t quite made the leap to what Stefan Thomke, professor at Harvard Business School, calls “experimental organizations.” That’s a shame, he observes, because virtual, data-driven experiments are proving to be far more on target than gut instincts, or anecdotally gathered proof points. “Whether it’s improving customer experiences, trying out new business models, or developing products and services, even the most experienced managers are wrong, whether they like it or not,” he writes in his upcoming book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Experimentation-Works-Surprising-Business-Experiments/dp/163369710X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr="><i>Experimentation Works: The Surprising Power of Business Experiments</i></a><i>.</i></p>
      <p>Evolving into “experimental organizations” isn’t an overnight process, but is achievable on a long-term basis, especially with the continual adoption and growth of cloud and data analytics services. The costs of these environments keeps dropping, meaning that even the smallest organizations with the tightest budgets can run many tests at high velocity, very cheaply.</p>
      <p>In his book, Thomke provides his insights on the value of experimenting online:</p>
      <p><b>Experimentation-driven innovation will help boost intuition and judgment: </b>While relying on data may seem to push intuition aside, quite the opposite is true, Intuition and experimentation need each other, he writes. “Intuition, customer insights, and qualitative research are valuable sources for new hypotheses, which may or may not be refuted – but hypotheses can be improved through rigorous testing. The empirical evidence shows that even experts are poor at predicting customer behavior; in fact, they get it wrong most of the time. Wouldn’t it be preferable to know what does and does not work early and focus resources on the most promising ideas?”</p>
      <p><b>Online experiments mean incremental improvements, and ultimately, breakthrough performance changes. </b>Experiments don’t have to be big-deal events. Day-to-day low-key experiments – such as tweaks in web messaging or placement of graphic features – may seem relatively trivial, but the benefits add up. “Breakthroughs in business performance aren’t always the result one or a few big changes,” Thomke points out. “They can also come from the continuous flow of many smaller successful changes that can accumulate quickly and can operate on customers over a long period of time.”</p>
      <p><b>You don’t need a lot of hypotheses for large-scale experiments.</b> “When managers hear about leading digital companies launching dozens of new experiments every day, they get intimidated,” says Thomke. But even among the most intense experimentation companies, accomplishments have come through “the careful design and redesign of experimentation systems and years of practice.”</p>
      <p><b>Brick-and-mortar companies can experiment, too.</b> Thomke points to established companies, such as State Farm Insurance, which “runs between 100 and 200 tests annually, and benefits significantly from what it learns.” He also points out that the limited sample sizes traditional companies may be working with should not be seen as an impediment. “A risk of using large digital companies to demonstrate the power of business experiments is that skeptics immediately focus on sample size.”</p>
      <p>Thomke also adds some cautionary notes as well. For example, there’s the classic statistician’s credo that “correlation is not causation,” and businesses should be careful about the conclusions they draw from testing. “Having a superficial understanding of why things happen can be costly,” he states.</p>
      <p>In addition, there are ethical considerations to running experiments on customers: “Clearly, the search for knowledge doesn’t give companies a license to run tests that are unethical.” Medical research, for example, needs prior consent and oversight. Experiments intended to be emotionally manipulative, with users’ prior consent – may skirt the line. At the same time, Thomke adds, “the real jeopardy isn’t running unethical experiments that are somehow out of control. The bigger risk is not to experiment and forgo a capability that’s critical for innovation.”</p>
