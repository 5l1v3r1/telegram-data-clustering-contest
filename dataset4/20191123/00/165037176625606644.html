        <b>Kevin De Bruyne says Manchester City know the hard work they have to put in after they came from behind to beat Chelsea 2-1 and leapfrog them into third place in the Premier League.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Liverpool's late win at Crystal Palace earlier on Saturday meant City started <b>12 points behind the leaders</b> and looked in danger of failing to cut that gap when <b>N'Golo Kante gave Chelsea a deserved lead</b> midway through the first half.</p>
      <p>However, De Bruyne's deflected strike breathed new life into Pep Guardiola's men and a <b>trademark left-footed finish from Riyad Mahrez </b>saw City edge a thrilling encounter.</p>
      <p>"We had a couple of chances at the beginning and didn't hit the target," De Bruyne told Sky Sports.</p>

      <p>"They scored but then we reacted with two quick goals. In the second half we kept it tight -- they might have had more of the ball but <b>we created the better chances</b>.</p>
      <p>"We don't care what happens to other teams -- Liverpool, Leicester, Chelsea -- we have to keep running. We know after the last two years the hard work we have to put in."</p>
      <p>Mahrez said:Â "It was a difficult game but we reacted very well after we conceded the first goal. <b>This type of game it's most important to get three points</b>. We're not going to play very good all the time."</p>
