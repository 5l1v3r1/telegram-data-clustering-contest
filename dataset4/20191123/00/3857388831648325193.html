      <p>Nigerian-American author Chris Abani presents a different style of memoir in his book <i>The Face: Cartography of the Void.</i></p>
      <p>At just under 100 pages, the book seems to end when you have hardly begun. Using the study of his face as a kind of living map, Abani opens up about his childhood, culture, identity and a troubled relationship with his father.</p>
      <p>Abani was born and raised in Nigeria, the fourth-born son of an Igbo father and British mother. His father was a violent man and an unfaithful husband, yet an upstanding citizen.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of the book, Abani hints at its purpose, writing that this is a “way to honour love and truth without something getting lost in the translation”. It is not a chronological account, and the storyline moves between the present, past and historical events in a disorienting way.</p>
      <p><i>The Face</i> looks at the face value of identity. Being mixed race, Abani struggled with being viewed as different both in Nigeria and abroad.</p>
      <p>At home he was mistaken for a foreigner and subjected to badmouthing by strangers. Being darker, chubby and kinky-haired he was often compared to his skinny, fair, straight-haired brother.</p>

      <p>The study of the face is also an exploration of family lineage, especially of the Igbo culture of his father, and what traditionally defines a son, a man and status in society.</p>
      <p>He makes comparisons with Western descriptions of the human being, such as the one-sided ideal of beauty versus the “complex concept in West Africa”.</p>
      <p><i>The Face</i> broadens our definition of identity, partly through reflections of Nigerian traditions that see the spirit and mind as equally important parts of an individual as their face.</p>
      <p>Abani quoted a friend when he said, “the cause of all our trouble is the belief in an essential, pure identity: religious, ethnic, historical, and ideological”. He himself is multi-talented, being a novelist, poet, screenwriter, photographer and musician.</p>
      <p>I found the the paternal recollections most heart-breaking, with the ghost of Abani senior hanging heavy throughout the book.</p>
      <p>His father, whom he closely resembled, called him a disappointment and tried to beat the artistic leanings out of him. It was a love-hate relationship. Only separation, time and his father’s death brought some measure of reconciliation.</p>
