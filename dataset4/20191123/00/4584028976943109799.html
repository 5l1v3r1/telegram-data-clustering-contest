      <h1>A-League Review: McGree hits double after week of controversy</h1>

      <p>Riley McGree ended a torrid week on a high by scoring a brace in Adelaide United's 3-1 win over Melbourne Victory.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old midfielder was one of four Olyroos players handed long suspensions - McGree's runs until April 1, 2020 - following an incident involving a woman in Cambodia when on international duty seven months ago.</p>
      <p>But his goals, along with a Migjen Basha own goal, helped United extend their A-League winning streak to four matches with a convincing result at Coopers Stadium, where Ola Toivonen scored for the visitors.</p>
      <p>That win keeps United hot on the heels of second-placed Sydney FC, who beat Perth Glory 3-1 in a game marked by controversial VAR rulings.</p>
      <p>Diego Castro tugged Milos Ninkovic's shirt before the player went to ground and the decision to give a penalty was upheld by VAR, allowing Adam Le Fondre to open the scoring with a powerful spot-kick.</p>
      <p>The home crowd seethed at what looked an unjust opener until Neil Kilkenny's high ball forward was headed down by Joel Chianese into the path of Bruno Fornaroli who opened his body and volleyed into the corner of the net to restore parity one minute before half-time.</p>
      <p>But Sydney restored their lead when Kosta Barbarouses appeared to come from an offside position before racing through on goal and scoring with a deflected strike, and Ninkovic then finished a neat passing move with a side-footed finish into the bottom corner of the net.</p>
      <p>Fornaroli had a goal disallowed for offside as Perth piled forward but Tony Popovic's men were left to reflect on a second consecutive home defeat in the league.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Ufuk Talay delivered his first win as coach of Wellington Phoenix, who survived a late fightback from Brisbane Roar to emerge with a 2-1 victory at Westpac Stadium.</p>
      <p>Steven Taylor put the A-League strugglers ahead when he rose above Macaulay Gillesphey to head home Ulises Davila's dinked cross after 10 minutes, and Davila ensured the momentum stayed with Wellington when he skipped through Brisbane's defence before beating Max Crocombe with a shot from the edge of the box.</p>
      <p>Stefan Mauk gave Robbie Fowler's men late hope when he turned Brad Inman's cut-back into the net with five minutes left but a flurry of chances failed to deliver an equaliser as the Roar lost for the third time in five league outings.</p>
