      <h1>South Africa outlook cut to negative by S&amp;P</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/author/bloomberg/" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a></address>
      <p>South Africa could fall deeper into junk territory after S&amp;P Global Ratings cut the outlook on its assessment of the nation’s debt to negative, citing the slow growth, upwardly revised fiscal deficit and growing debt burden.</p>
      <p>S&amp;P left unchanged South Africa’s rating of BB, two steps below investment grade.</p>
      <p>“We could lower the ratings if we were to observe continued fiscal deterioration,” S&amp;P said in a statement.</p>
      <p>South Africa’s finances are deteriorating due to billions of dollars in bailouts for unprofitable power producer Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd.</p>
      <p>Gross government debt is set to surge to 80.9% of gross domestic product by fiscal 2028 unless urgent action is taken, the National Treasury said last month.</p>
      <p>The trajectory is almost 20 percentage points higher than forecast in the February budget and shows no sign of stabilizing.</p>
      <p>Sixteen of 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted the move.</p>
      <p>Another cut means it will take South Africa even longer to regain its investment-grade status at S&amp;P, the first major ratings company to cut the nation to junk in 2017 after former president Jacob Zuma replaced the finance minister in a late-night cabinet shake-up.</p>
      <p>The nation is now led by Cyril Ramaphosa.</p>
      <p>Moody’s lowered the outlook on its investment grade rating to negative less than three weeks ago, effectively giving the nation three months to get its finances in order.</p>
      <p>A Moody’s downgrade would force South Africa out of the FTSE World Government Bond Index, which could prompt a sell-off and outflows of as much as $15 billion, according to Bank of New York Mellon Corp.</p>
      <p>It will also raise borrowing costs and make it even more difficult for government to finance the budget.</p>
      <p>Here’s what analysts had to say:</p>
      <p>Daniel Tenengauzer, head of markets strategy at BNY Mellon in New York: “I don’t think it makes a big difference,” Tenengauzer said. “The only thing that could move the rand from here would be an actual downgrade”.</p>
      <p>“It’s important to keep in mind that Moody’s clearly is the more critical because it could trigger the WGBI exit. Having said that, if the spread between S&amp;P and Moody’s widens too much, that obviously should push Moody’s in that direction as well”</p>
      <p>Razia Khan, chief economist for Africa and the Middle East at Standard Chartered Bank Plc in London: The market impact “should be negligible,“ because it was so widely expected, she said.</p>
      <p>At the same time, though, “it does provide important political cover to both the Ramaphosa administration, and to the Treasury in particular, to pursue faster fiscal and structural reform”.</p>
      <p>Brendan McKenna, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York: S&amp;P’s decision “probably doesn’t impact the currency all that much just given S&amp;P’s credit rating is already non-investment grade,” he said. There’s a small risk, though, that it influences Moody’s Investors Service to downgrade the nation as well.</p>
