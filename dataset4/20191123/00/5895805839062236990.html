      <p>In the news this month, we’ve heard about Jollyamma “Jolly” Joseph, a 47-year-old mother of two sons residing in India, who fatally poisoned six of her relatives between 2002 and 2016. She used cyanide. When police arrested her in October, she confessed. Neighbors had considered her to be “smart,” “jovial,” and even “pious.” Clearly, she had a dark side.</p>
      <p>The so-called Cyanide Killer started with her mother-in-law, poisoning a mutton soup. The father-in-law died six years later after eating toxic tapioca. Finally, Jolly Joseph targeted her husband, Roy. He, too, ate a meal and faded away. None of the incidents was investigated. In fact, Roy’s death was ruled a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/suicide">suicide</a>. The family began to think they’d been cursed. Over the next five years, three more relatives died. In 2017, Joseph announced that she would marry her deceased husband’s cousin, whose wife and 2-year-old daughter were among the final three.</p>
      <p>A suspicious relative asked police to investigate. When they did, they learned that Jolly was an imposter. For years, she’d pretended to be a lecturer at an elite college. Each day when she left home, she pretended to go to her job at Calicut University's National Institute of Technology. This red flag, along with other inconsistencies in her stories about her dead relatives, launched a full-scale investigation of all six deaths. Each was declared a homicide.</p>
      <p>Most articles about Jolly Joseph emphasize how rare it is to find female serial killers. However, we’ve not only had them among us for centuries, they can be just as violent as males. So can other types of female offenders. A recent book makes the case.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/forensic-therapy">Forensic</a> clinical evaluator Stephanie Scott-Snyder undertook a series of interviews with some of America’s most violent women for her second book <i>When Women Offend: Crime and the Female Perpetrator.</i> She’s a mental health clinician and certified forensic counselor who provides court-mandated treatment to adult sexual offenders. She also trains law enforcement and social service personnel in mental health matters related to crime.</p>
      <p>Opening the book with infamous pig farmer and serial killer Belle Gunness, Scott-Snyder describes how law enforcement resisted the idea that women could be serial killers. That was in 1908. But eighty years later, the FBI still held the same stance. This sets the stage for Scott-Snyder to tackle the myth that woman are not violent like men and don't have the typical male motivators. They’re not angry or predatory, the myths tell us, they’re simply <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/jealousy">jealous</a> or greedy. Worse yet, they must have been in love and helpless to their emotional needs. These ideas seem to derive from the predominant male influence on criminal theory.</p>
      <p><i>When Women Offend</i> looks at a variety of women who've committed violent acts. They don’t represent female offenders in general, but they do show that women are capable of violence on an equal scale to men. Intending to thrust such women into the criminological discussions, Scott-Myers describes cases and interviews several offenders. Her intent is to show the women have their own crime narratives and that these pathways into violence, with their unique risk factors, should be acknowledged.</p>
      <p>In this work, you’ll find not just female serial killers but also single-act killers, murderous mothers, women who killed as part of a team, outright female psychopaths, drug “queenpins” and terrorists. Although there are differences between lone and co-offending females, as well as between those who offend once vs. multiple times with different victims, we see overlapping issues. Many of these women were victimized as children or subjected to conditions that made them vulnerable to becoming aggressors. Despite social stereotypes about females as nurturers, some can be aggressive, punitive and predatory.</p>
      <p>For the women Scott-Snyder interviewed, she provides transcripts.</p>
      <p>One offender, “Susan,” was media-ready when Scott-Snyder arrived to interview her. She’d been on several true crime programs and considered herself special. Marrying into wealth, she'd killed her older husband and then covered up her crime. Despite her conviction, she continued to deny doing it. She whined about not seeing her children and suggested her husband had taken his own life. She'd clearly spent time devising such a scenario. She admitted to having an affair with her stepson and blamed him for taking advantage of her. Throughout the interview, her <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/narcissism">narcissism</a> is clear, but her inability to recognize how she comes across offers a great illustration of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/deception">self-deception</a> for therapists.</p>
      <p>Scott-Snyder's discussion of theory, the cases she analyzes, and the interviews she offers should be considered a solid contribution to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/law-and-crime">criminology</a>.</p>

      <p>Yes, yes women are capable of murder!<br/>Obviously my mother didn't succeed in killing me.<br/>When I was a baby, my mother left me in a stroller out in the snow. My dad came home to find me. My mother told my dad that she thought I needed fresh air.<br/>Another time, I was maybe preschool age, I was in the bathroom, there was some water on the floor and she had me plug a heater in while standing in the water. I remember the pain still and those flashes come back still when I plug something in.....took years to get over that fear.<br/>Women who have murderous intentions are able to hide their intentions because they plot in a way that none suspect them, especially if they are a mother.</p>
