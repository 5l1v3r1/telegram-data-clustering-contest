      <h1>Atalanta vs Juve (3:00pm): CR7 benched again!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:12:21+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 00:12</time> by <a rel="author">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p><b>Juventus</b> coach Maurizio Sarri has confirmed that Cristiano Ronaldo will miss saturday’s (today) match against Atalanta. “Certain players need to be left to cool off.”</p>
      <p>Ronaldos fitness has come under the spotlight after Sarri alleged he was nursing a knee injury, yet he scored for Portugal during the international break and denied there was anything wrong with him.</p>
      <p>The pair have since come back in contact and the former Napoli boss made it clear he had no reason to sit down with his No 7.</p>
      <p>“There’s no need to clarify anything with Ronaldo. Certain players need to be left to cool off,” he said at a Press conference.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the 60-year-old did concede the forward had returned from international duty with the same issue that saw him controversially subbed off against Milan.</p>
      <p>“The problem is that on Tuesday, he told us that he was still not feeling well.</p>
      <p>“Our objective is to have him back for the Champions League. I’m 99 percent sure he won’t make it on Saturday (today).”</p>
      <p>Sarri also announced Miralem Pjanic and Blaise Matuidi would be fit for the trip to Bergamo but cast doubt over Adrien Rabiot and Juan Cuadrado.</p>
      <p>“There are some players with a few issues. Alex Sandro’s problem is less serious than we initially feared, whilst [Adrien] Rabiot has a problem with his adductor.</p>
      <p>“(Juan) Cuadrado is struggling with pain in his back, but (Miralem) Pjanic will be available.</p>
      <p>“(Blaise) Matuidi is in some pain, but his character will get him through it. He will be available.”</p>
