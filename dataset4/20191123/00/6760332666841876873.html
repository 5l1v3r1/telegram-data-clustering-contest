      <p>Director Jeevan Reddy says that 'George Reddy' is a balanced and fair biopic that doesn't hurt anybody.  In this interview, catch him talk about what went into learning about George Reddy, using creative liberties and more. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Action scenes were needed </b>
      </p>
      <p>The action scenes in the film had to be added because this film needs the blade fights, etc.  The audience would feel bored if you fill the entire film with speeches.  I can't answer every question raised by the critics of the movie.  The pace of the film may be slow in some places, as required by the nature of the story.  The dialogues, too, are quite organic.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Many stories out there</b>
      </p>
      <p>The feedback from the audience is satisfying.  I didn't expect this kind of response.  There are many stories of George Reddy that people know of.  I have made the story that I know of.  Some things have been dramatized in the movie for the sake of entertainment.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>A long story told in short</b>
      </p>
      <p>A film like this can't be loved by one and all.  Objections will always be raised by some.  It took 1.5 years to write the script.  It would have taken a 10-hour long film had I told every single major incident in George's life.  It would have taken Rs 200 Cr to make such a biopic.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Kudos to male lead</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sandeep Madhav was in the character for three years.  He walked and slept the character.  People are going to remember only him when they think of George after this movie.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>No offence</b>
      </p>
      <p>We haven't offended anyone in the film.  Had I done that, I wouldn't be talking here with you today.  I have made the movie with sincerity, looking into George's eyes.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>No love track in the movie</b>
      </p>
      <p>I don't call it a love track that is there in the movie.  The heroine merely moons over him, but there is no reciprocal reaction.  I have read that George used to be looked up to in awe whenever and wherever he was around.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Debating is more important</b>
      </p>
      <p>Films like 'George Reddy' spark debates.  That's more important than ideological affiliations.  I didn't touch upon the Telangana movement in the film because that's a separate chapter.  I will tell the story in a separate movie.  That's my dream, too.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Being dispassionate </b>
      </p>
      <p>George was an enigmatic character about whom not everything is known.  I gathered information from many and studied it dispassionately. The film touches upon almost every aspect of his life.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Cinematic liberties</b>
      </p>
      <p>I know that George used to walk on foot and had no pocket money even. We have taken creative liberties in showcasing the character as a Royal Enfield-rider.  These days, all students have bikes.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Fictional accounts are there</b>
      </p>
      <p>What have I not shown in the movie?  Nobody is giving an answer.  We spoke to about 120 old-timers as part of research on George.  Many of them must have given some fictional accounts somewhere.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Union elections would be good</b>
      </p>
      <p>Back in the 1970s, it was a dark era.  If student elections are held today on campuses, nobody will resort to violence.  It's because of the advancement in technology, media reach, etc.</p>
