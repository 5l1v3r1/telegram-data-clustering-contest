      <h1>Irish Women's Hockey Team Face World Cup Final Rematch At Olympics</h1>

      <p>The women's hockey pools for the 2020 Olympics have been confirmed, with Ireland facing a World Cup final rematch against The Netherlands.</p>
      <p>This will be Ireland's first appearance at the Olympics, having secured qualification in dramatic circumstances earlier this month. They defeated Canada in an enthralling penalty shootout at the RDS, overturning an early deficit in the shootout to emerge victorious.</p>
      <p>Their Olympic pool contains six teams, with the top four teams from each group advancing to the quarter final.</p>
      <p>Alongside World Cup winners The Netherlands, Ireland have also been paired with reigning Olympic champions United Kingdom, Germany, India and South Africa. Germany sit in fourth place in the world rankings, one spot ahead of the British.</p>
      <p>Ireland are the second lowest ranked team in the pool in eighth place, with India in 11th. The Netherlands are the world's number one side.</p>
      <p>The fixtures will be confirmed next month, but a shot at revenge after the 6-0 defeat in last year's World Cup decider will surely be on their minds.</p>
