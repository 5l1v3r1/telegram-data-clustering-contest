      <p>Acting Midlands provincial police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Ethel Mukwende confirmed that police are investigating two cases of sudden death by hanging and drowning involving a father and daughter at Insukamini Dam in Lower Gweru on Monday evening.</p>
      <p>Asst Insp Mukwende identified the taxi driver as Lot Josiya (42) of Woodlands Park suburb in Gweru</p>
      <p>“Police in Gweru are investigating two cases of sudden death where a man was found hanging from a tree after he allegedly drowned his two- year- old daughter in Insukamini Dam in Lower Gweru about 30 km from Gweru.</p>
      <p>The horrific incident occurred on 18 November at Insukamini Dam in Lower Gweru at around 9.30PM,” she said.</p>
      <p>Asst Insp Mukwende said Josiya allegedly visited his girlfriend whom he has a child with in Mambo suburb.</p>
      <p>“It is alleged that the two had a misunderstanding over the custody of their daughter, Prudence Josiya. It is further alleged that he forcibly took the child and drove off to an unknown destination,” she said.</p>
      <p>Asst Insp Mukwende said later that night, Josiya allegedly sent a text message to the mother of the child informing her that he intended to drown himself and the child in Insukamini Dam.</p>
      <p>The following day at around 9AM, Asst Insp Mukwende said a passerby discovered Josiya’s body hanging from a tree near the dam and reported the matter to the police.</p>
      <p>“Police attended the scene and further searches were done around the dam and the body of the toddler was discovered floating near the dam wall,” she said.</p>
      <p>Asst Insp Mukwende said Josiya’s vehicle was found parked near the dam.</p>
      <p>“The two bodies were taken to Gweru Provincial Hospital for postmortem,” she said.</p>
