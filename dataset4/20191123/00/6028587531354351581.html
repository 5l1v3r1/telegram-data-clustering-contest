      <h1>Review: Mujjo Double-Insulated Touchscreen Gloves</h1>

      <p>Touchscreen gloves are the greatest thing since the invention of the smartphone — at least if you live in an area where it gets cold in the winter. The problem is that most touchscreen gloves are thin, which makes them an imperfect solution in areas where it gets <i>really</i> cold. Being able to use your smartphone outside isn’t much use if your hands are freezing... I live in Canada, and I’ve experienced this issue first-hand. A few weeks ago, we had an early blast of winter, along with much of the U.S., and it was cold enough that wearing around a pair of typical touchscreen gloves quickly become uncomfortable. Fortunately, the latest offering from Mujjo arrived just in time: <a href="https://www.mujjo.com/touchscreen-gloves/double-insulated-touchscreen-gloves">Mujjo Double-Insulated Touchscreen Gloves</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Really, Really Warm</b>
      </p>
      <p>I have touchscreen gloves that are nothing more than thin fabric, and another pair that adds a layer of 3M Thinsulate insulation, but neither of these stands up to extreme cold. In addition. winter winds can whip right through them.</p>
      <p>Mujjo starts with a durable and wind-resistant Micro Pique outer shell. The inside is a layer of double-bonded Micro Fleece that feels comfortable and warm against the hand, while adding additional wind resistance. In between there two layers, Mujjo added 3M Thinsulate. This synthetic thermal fiber insulation helps to keep the warmth from your hands from escaping. The combination of the three layers makes for gloves that keep hands toasty warm. In mid-November, even when temperatures dropped to 12-degrees F (accompanied by bitter wind), my hands stayed nice and warm while wearing these gloves.</p>
      <p>The glove fabric has some stretch, but I did find the fit a little tight, so you might want to consider ordering a size up.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Not Quite as Flexible, But Still Great for Touchscreen Use</b>
      </p>
      <p>There’s a reason why so many smartphone gloves are made from thin material: flexibility. And with the Mujjo gloves’ triple-layer, double-insulated design, there’s no avoiding the fact that you lose some of that flexibility. In addition, each finger is physically larger, making precision touch operation more challenging. </p>
      <p>However, Mujjo has coated the inside surfaces of these gloves with a highly conductive treatment. You don’t have to find sweet spot at the end of a finger for the touchscreen to respond — pretty much any contact from any finger (even the thumbs and the palm) — will do it. This makes it much easier to use a smartphone, even with a little extra bulk. In addition, Mujjo added a series of grippy silicone line patterns in key areas to aid smartphone gip. Even in cold and wet conditions, one hand will offer a secure grip of your phone.</p>
      <p>You’re not going to be wearing these gloves while playing a game or editing a photo on your smartphone, but for the basics — including answering and making calls and responding to messages — I found them perfectly usable. </p>
