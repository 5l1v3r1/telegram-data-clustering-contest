      <p>Save the Nation for Future Leaders, a pressure group has petitioned President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo and Parliament, to legalize marijuana for medicinal and commercial purposes.</p>
      <p>The group, however, said sanctions for recreational use of marijuana should be maintained.</p>
      <p>The group repeated its call, in an interview with journalists at the Parliament House in Accra, after presenting the petition to the Chief of Staff of the Presidency; and Parliament, through its Public Affairs Department.</p>
      <p>The group made a case for the drug to be legalized, citing its economic benefits to countries which had engaged in large scale production.</p>
      <p>Mr Kwadwo Atta Apeakorang, President and Founder of the group, said: “Save The Nation for Future Leaders does not support universal marijuana legalisation as recreational use of the drug cannot be regulated by the State.</p>
      <p>“Thus, while we call for the drug to be legalised for commercial purposes, sanctions for recreational use should be maintained.”</p>
      <p>He said Ghana would also benefit if it engaged in the thriving marijuana business, which he said was sustaining the economies of the developed world and other African countries.</p>
      <p>“It is economically unwise for Ghana, a developing country, to waste both capital and human resources to destroy marijuana,” Mr Ape said.</p>
      <p>He recalled that in the last few years, about three hundred acres of marijuana plantation and tonnes of same had been destroyed by a joint team of personnel from the Narcotics Control Board, Ghana Police Service and other security agencies.</p>
      <p>He said statistics indicated that in 2017, marijuana sales in some parts of the USA reached $655m, outweighing that of alcohol by over $100m and it is estimated that an acre of marijuana plantation generates as much as $1.1m in revenue.</p>
      <p>Mr Apeakorang said the deployment of logistics and personnel for the destruction exercises had cost Ghana about $1bn.</p>
      <p>He described marijuana as “being a burgeoning, dynamic and valuable non-traditional export commodity,” which provides important sources of income for large numbers of people in the distribution chain of the drug.</p>
      <p>“In the developed world, marijuana has generated $2.2bn and $1.56bn for US states of California and Colorado respectively, while in Africa, Uganda has signed a deal worth $3bn to export medical marijuana to Canada and Germany,” Mr Apeakorang said.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the Moroccan marijuana business is estimated to generate $10bn annually.</p>
      <p>According to Mr Apeakorang, currently, Ghana exported 900,000 tonnes of cocoa annually, accruing about $2 billion; and while marijuana matures and is harvested after three months, the first pods from cocoa are harvested after three years; thus, in three years, a farmer may harvest marijuana about ten times.</p>
      <p>The group said it was convinced that a 150-acre marijuana plantation would generate more than $2 billion if maintained for four years.</p>
      <p>The group called on the Government of Ghana to consider adding marijuana to the list of crops approved for Planting for Food and Jobs flagship programme, and to be made a special initiative carried out or supervised by the military.</p>
      <p>“Legalising and regulating marijuana cultivation, harvesting, processing and export, could earn Ghana more foreign exchange than what cash crops and minerals are earning,’ the group said.</p>
