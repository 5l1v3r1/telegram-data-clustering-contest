      <h1>Michail Antonio Becomes Just the Fourth Player to Score PL Goals Against the Same Team at 4 Stadiums</h1>

      <p>​Michail Antonio kept up his impressive scoring record against Spurs on Saturday as he registered West Ham's first goal in a 3-2 defeat to Jose Mourinho's new side.</p>
      <p>Spurs stormed into a 3-0 lead with Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane all netting before Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna each pulled a goal back for the hosts in an exciting game. </p>
      <p>It was not the first time that the former Nottingham Forest winger has haunted Spurs. </p>

      <p>Previously Antonio had netted three goals against the Lilywhites and his consolation strike in Saturday's meeting ensured he accomplished a rather peculiar scoring feat. </p>
      <p>Due to <a href="http://90min.com/teams/west-ham">​West Ham</a> and Tottenham's recent stadium moves, Antonio has scored each of his four goals against the Lilywhites in a different venue.</p>
      <p>Only three other players in Premier League era have done the same: Steed Malbranque (Fulham v Man City), Dele Alli (Tottenham v Watford) and Christian Eriksen (Tottenham v Everton).</p>
      <p>As noted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/1198240879124910083">​Opta</a>, Antonio has now registered a goal against <a href="http://90min.com/teams/tottenham">​Spurs</a> at Upton Park, White Hart Lane, the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and the London Stadium. </p>

      <p>His first strike came at Tottenham's former home in November 2016. Antonio's first-half header was not enough to secure his side the points at White Hart Lane however, as Spurs eventually ran out 3-2 winners. </p>
      <p>The second goal was scored at Upton Park later in the same season. That time, Antonio's first-half strike was enough to earn West Ham the three points as Spurs missed the chance to move to the top of the Premier League table, instead falling to a 1-0 defeat. </p>

      <p>The winger would have to wait a while to score his third goal against Tottenham - April 2019 to be precise. </p>
      <p>On this occasion, Antonio lashed a volley home to again ensure his side recorded a 1-0 victory which dented Spurs' hopes of finishing in the top four. </p>
      <p>Tottenham must be sick of the sight of him by now!</p>
