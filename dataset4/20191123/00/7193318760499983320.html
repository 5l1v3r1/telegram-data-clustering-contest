      <p>Austin, Texas-based Shane Smith &amp; The Saints survived a harrowing bus fire en route to their Thursday night show in Lubbock, Texas. The band escaped uninjured, but their bus and trailer were completely destroyed along with their instruments, merchandise, and personal possessions.</p>
      <p>Still, the band is playing on in Oklahoma City, performing their previously scheduled concert at 8 tonight at the Tower Theatre, 425 NW 23. Doors open at 7 p.m. For tickets and information, go to <a href="https://www.towertheatreokc.com/">www.towertheatreokc.com</a>.</p>

      <p>On the highway in Coleman, Texas, passersby alerted the driver that something was wrong with the bus, so he pulled over to investigate. To his shock he discovered flames shooting out from the undercarriage, according to a news release. The band was asleep in their bunks at the time, but luckily the driver and tour manager were able to get everyone off of the bus safely. Within minutes, the bus and trailer were completely engulfed in flames and burned down to the shell. The band was unable to remove their possessions or instruments from the fire due to the flames.</p>
      <p>“We are thanking God that we’re all okay and everyone made it out safe. I don’t even know what to say, we lost everything. We’re so grateful for the outpouring of support from fans and fellow musicians. We’re still playing the shows, see you on the road," said Smith in a statement.</p>
      <p>The group found transportation to their show at Cook’s Garage in Lubbock and performed on schedule Thursday with borrowed instruments loaned from fans and friends. The band plans on keeping all scheduled performances, including the show tonight at the Tower Theatre and Saturday at The Cotillion Ballroom in Wichita, Kansas.</p>

      <p>Cook's Garage donated all the door proceeds from the show last night to the band. Organically, fans (including Tower Theatre management) have already started posting on socials to rally ticket sales and merch purchases. Additional details will be available soon for fans who wish to show their support.</p>
      <p>Amazingly, this is not the first time the band has escaped harm with members having survived and triumphed through three previous near-death experiences: a rattlesnake bite, a motorcycle accident, and a pulmonary embolism while on tour in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>Shane Smith and the Saints released their third album, "Hail Mary," earlier this year and have earned their large following from extensive touring in 40 states and on three different continents. The band has and more than 13 million streams on Spotify and is currently on tour. To learn more, visit <a href="https://t.e2ma.net/click/1hu0dc/9zpnho/tfbimj">ShaneSmithMusic.com</a>.</p>
