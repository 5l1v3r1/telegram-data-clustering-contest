      <h2>Problem debt is one of the enemies of your mental health which must not be tolerated at all.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.moneyandmentalhealth.org/suicide-and-debt/">Problem debt is still one of the major causes of depression and other mental health issues</a>.  Socially speaking, debt no matter how small it is has long been cast into the stigmatised hell of rejection. But it is so much still with us. In fact, it is so close to impossibility not to have any bit of debt. But that is not a problem. It becomes a problem only when it turns into a problem debt.</p>
      <p>So what exactly is a problem debt?</p>
      <p>A problem debt is one that the debtor is incapable of paying off even when they are willing to. It is also known as over-indebtedness.</p>
      <p>Past events have shown that problem debts can be highly detrimental to the wellbeing of the individuals involved. This fact has been established by Studies that have found a strong connection between problem debts and <a href="https://thriveglobal.com/stories/how-debt-impacts-mental-health/">mental health problems</a>.</p>
      <p>And to be frank, the statistics are baffling.</p>
      <p>But despite the staggering data, the fact remains that problem debts can be avoided entirely. And where they are already raging, they can be disarmed and tamed.</p>
      <p>The following are actionable steps to manage your financial life.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1.      Have your budget handy</b>
      </p>
      <p>The first step towards financial sanity is making sure you plan how you want to spend your money, may be salary, before you get it. Remember the table of preference? Just something of such will do.</p>
      <p> Write down the amount of money you are expecting and what and what you need to spend money on – mark my words, you need to, not you want to.</p>
      <p>Let your budget be <a href="https://thriveglobal.com/stories/7-habits-to-help-you-stay-on-top-of-your-finances/">all encompassing and realistic</a>. And it should not be all about spending alone. Saving must feature there too.</p>
      <p>Including the amount you want to put away in the budget is good because that can help you to raise an emergency fund.</p>
      <p>Financial experts are of the opinion that having an emergency money for unforeseen situations that require money is very important for your mental health.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2.      Implement your budget religiously</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having a budget is one thing, implementing it is another. Where the budget is grossly disregarded, it is as good as not having one in the first place.</p>
      <p>Here, the bottom line is don’t step out of the safe region of your budget. You are not safe out there.</p>
      <p>To be able to do this, you have to be very discipline and responsible in the use of your cards. Though having <a href="https://raterush.com/category/credit-cards/">credit cards</a> has lots of advantages, for some people, it may be better that they don’t have any. The same with debit cards.</p>
      <p>In a way, these cards temptingly encourage spending when it is unnecessary.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3.      Manage inevitable debts</b>
      </p>
      <p>No doubt some debts are just unavoidable. These are debts that stick like leeches trying to drain your purse.</p>
      <p>So how do you manage such indebtedness and stop them from deteriorate into debt problems?            </p>
      <p>First, you need to make an extensive list of all your debts and those you owe.</p>
      <p>Second, decide on how much you can afford monthly for settlement of debts. And be realistic in doing it.</p>
      <p>Finally, decide on which of your debts to pay off first. It is important that you consider the immediate financial implication of paying off each before taking this decision.  Your second decision will come in handy at this point.</p>
      <p>Then pay and be religious about it. Persistence and consistency win the race.</p>
