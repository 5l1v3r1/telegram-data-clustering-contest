        <b>Reigning Gran Turismo Nations Cup champion Igor Fraga suffered a shock exit from the World Finals in Monaco on Friday as a result of a first-corner spin.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fraga, who was a race winner in the Formula Regional European Championship this year, started the weekend as one of the pre-event favourites, but it all went wrong within seconds of the start of his semi-final heat at the Red Bull Ring.</p>
      <p>Running behind main rival Mikail Hizal through the opening corner, Fraga ran over the sausage kerb on the exit and was pitched into a spin that put him in the barriers.</p>
      <p>He dropped to last place, three seconds off the back of the field, and needed a top-seven finish to keep himself in the event and get a second shot in the Repechage race.</p>
      <p>But despite a spirited recovery as he hauled himself back up to 10th, he could not move up far enough before the chequered flag so will not be a part of Sunday's final.</p>
      <p>Hizal, who went on to take a comfortable victory, later consoled the dejected Fraga - with whom he has shared a long rivalry in the Gran Turismo events.</p>
      <p>Australian Cody Nikola Latkovski triumphed in the second semi-final at Dragon Trail Seaside, while Takuma Miyazono won the third semi-final.</p>
      <p>American Daniel Solis clinched his place in Sunday's final event with victory in the Repechage race at Laguna Seca.</p>
      <p>The action in Monaco was overseen by world champion Lewis Hamilton, who has just launched a series of official time trial events for the Gran Turismo Sport series.</p>
      <p>Hamilton, partnered by Fraga, finished third in a special Pro Am race around Spa-Francorchamps.</p>
