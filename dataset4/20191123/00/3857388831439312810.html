      <p>The body that regulates electronic media in Tanzania has warned TV and radio stations against hiring people who don’t have the "required qualifications" to practise journalism.</p>
      <p>“Those who don’t heed this warning will be fined or have their licences withdrawn as stipulated in law,” the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) said in a notice published in the government-owned<i> Daily News </i>newspaper.</p>
      <p>According to the 2016 Media Services Act, only those with a minimum of a communication-related diploma (one-two years of study) can be be accredited as journalists.</p>
      <p>But media graduates have long complained that they miss out on jobs, as TV and radio stations prefer DJs and comedians.</p>
      <p>They say that those not trained in media school are prone to ignoring the profession's ethical standards.</p>
      <p>A journalist tweeted TCRA's statement and praised the agency for taking action.</p>
