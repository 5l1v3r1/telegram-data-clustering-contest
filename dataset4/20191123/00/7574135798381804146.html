They’re now touring in support of this year’s Ginger with rising UK rapper slowthai, who appears on Ginger and who released his excellent debut album There’s Nothing Great About Britain this year. Opening is the undefinable experimental duo 100 gecs. They return to MSG’s Hulu Theater for a second night.</p>
