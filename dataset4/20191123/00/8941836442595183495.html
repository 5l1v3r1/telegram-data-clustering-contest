      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) - Supreme Court <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ruth-bader-ginsburg/">Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> was hospitalized after experiencing chills and fever, the court said Saturday.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the court’s public information office said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ruth-bader-ginsburg/">Ginsburg</a> was admitted Friday night to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. She was initially evaluated at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington before being transferred to Johns Hopkins for further evaluation and treatment of any possible infection.</p>
      <p>With intravenous antibiotics and fluids, her symptoms abated and she expected to be released from the hospital as early as Sunday morning, the statement said.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ruth-bader-ginsburg/">Ginsburg</a>, 86, suffered what the court described as a stomach bug. She was absent from arguments on Nov. 13 but returned for the court’s next public meeting, on Nov. 18.</p>
