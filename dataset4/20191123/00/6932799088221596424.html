      <h1>Blade Runner-inspired bulletproof Tesla Cybertruck will slice through traffic but has breakable unbreakable windows</h1>

        <b>The Tesla Cybertruck has been officially revealed, and while the all-electric vehicle has been specifically designed to protect the environment, it will certainly make some eyes sore. Elon Musk unveiled the Blade Runner-esque truck, which can withstand a 9 mm bullet being shot at the door but not a small steel ball gently thrown at the window.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Elon Musk has shown the <a href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck?redirect=no">Tesla Cybertruck</a> off to the world, and things have got off to a rocky start. The vehicle was brought on stage at the Tesla Design Studio in Los Angeles, where the SpaceX captain got to extol the virtues of the unique design. Those worried about being shot at while driving will surely have been impressed by the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/22/cars/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-truck/index.html">clip</a> showing the Cybertruck’s armored exoskeleton's resistance to a 9 mm bullet. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the unbreakable windows.</p>
      <p>The windows of the Tesla Cybertruck are supposed to offer the occupants of the vehicle considerable protection from the environment due to the special armor glass they are fitted with. Sadly, they don’t offer much protection from small steel balls thrown at them by Tesla executives. Both the front and rear driver-side windows were shattered by the measured assault, with Musk joking that the first throw was too hard, and that the issues will be ironed out in “post”.</p>
      <p>There’s no denying the <a href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck?redirect=no">specs</a> of the Tesla Cybertruck are appealing though: 250-500 miles range (depending on the amount of motors), 0-60 mph in around 2.9 seconds for the tri-motor AWD model, 100 cubic feet of storage space, and 7,500 lbs to over 14,000 lbs of towing capacity. Three models have been revealed: single-motor RWD (rear-wheel drive), dual-motor AWD (all-wheel drive), and the tri-motor AWD. The basic single-motor RWD Cybertruck starts at US$39,900 and the cheapest AWD vehicle will set you back US$49,900, while optional extras can see the final price <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/22/tech/cybertruck-tesla-pickup-truck-jokes/index.html">cross</a> the US$70,000 mark.</p>
      <p>But regardless of the broken window SNAFU, the Tesla Cybertruck is supposed to present a new and modern option for those who want a vehicle with the power of a truck but without harming the environment via fossil fuel usage. However, the sharp edges that would give the Tesla Cybertruck the ability to literally slice through traffic and the overall anachronistic boxy design contribute to the vehicle being something of an eyesore. It looks like what a TV show production team from the 1980s would come up with if told to build a futuristic-looking vehicle on a budget of a few thousand dollars, a couple of cans of chrome spray paint and some spare cardboard boxes.</p>
