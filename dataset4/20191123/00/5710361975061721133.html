      <p>HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy Secretary said on Saturday he did not threaten to resign amid a disagreement with President Donald Trump over whether a Navy SEAL convicted of battlefield misconduct should face a board of peers who may oust him from the elite force.</p>
      <p>"Contrary to popular belief, I'm still here. I did not threaten to resign," Spencer said at a security conference in Halifax. The New York Times reported earlier on Saturday that Spencer had made the threat.</p>
      <p>Spencer said Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher should face a board of peers because "the process matters for good order and discipline," Reuters reported on Friday.</p>
      <p>Last Friday, Trump intervened in the case, ordering the Navy to restore Gallagher's rank and pay, and clearing the way for him to retire on a full pension.</p>
