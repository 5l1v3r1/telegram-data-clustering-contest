      <p>Strath Taieri School principal Emma Barker has tendered her resignation in the wake of a Ministry of Education report which found pupil achievement and wellbeing were at "serious risk" at the school.</p>
      <p>The Middlemarch school's board of trustees requested statutory intervention from the ministry in September, because of "a breakdown between the board, principal and staff".</p>
      <p>Limited statutory manager Nicola Hornsey said Miss Barker tendered her resignation "to allow the school to move forward".</p>
      <p>"Emma has been working hard to keep things going during the recent disruptions, and we appreciate the work she has done.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, Emma now needs to take some sick leave herself, and as she is unsure when she will be in a position to return, she has decided to resign so that the school can make a fresh start with some certainty in the 2020 school year."</p>
      <p>In a report to the ministry, Ms Hornsey said the teaching staff were well regarded and considered to be excellent practitioners by parents and education officials; the board was united in its view of the school's values and engaged in improving its effectiveness as a board.</p>
      <p>The board of trustees, teaching staff and many in the parent community had a shared view on the values of the school and how they should be reflected and modelled by the school's principal.</p>
      <p>But it was not a view that was subscribed to by all, she said.</p>
      <p>"There is, accordingly, a divide ... within the school community."</p>
      <p>She said high staff turnover was a feature of Strath Taieri School, staff morale was low and the breakdown in effective communication was having a "significant detrimental" effect on staff wellbeing.</p>
      <p>"The operations of the school and the consequent effect on student achievement and wellbeing are at serious risk."</p>
      <p>Ms Hornsey said senior teacher Kris Simpson would be acting principal until the end of the year.</p>
      <p>An acting principal would then be brought in to run the school for the first term next year and it was hoped a permanent replacement would be able to start in term 2.</p>
      <p>"I need to consult with the school community about the types of skills and attributes that they are looking for in a principal.</p>
      <p>"It will also allow the board to do its strategic planning for next year so that the new principal coming in, understands what the goals are for the school."</p>
      <p>Once it could be shown the issues had been addressed and any changes made were considered to be sustainable, the intervention could be revoked.</p>
      <p>The school's progress would be monitored monthly, and the intervention would be reviewed by the Ministry of Education next year, she said.</p>
