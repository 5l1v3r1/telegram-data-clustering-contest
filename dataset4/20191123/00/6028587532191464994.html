      <p>I especially love off-season travel. (In my new memoir, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Places-Remember-Truths-Delights-Countries/dp/0578593319"><i>Places I Remember: Tales, Truths, Delights from 100 Countries,</i> </a>I focus on the need in some popular cities, such as Bruges and Venice, to avoid crowds and to travel when most tourists are staying home and life caters to the locals.And you’ll be surprised at the hidden pleasures you’ll find, when you do. One favorite example: You might not think first of a visit to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennebunkport,_Maine">Kennebunkport, </a>Maine in winter, as it’s one of the great summer/fall destinations. But despite colder weather, consider crisp Atlantic coastline air <i>without</i> the tourists<b>, </b>and cozy evenings by a fireplace after a farm-to-table meal and a day of outdoor fun.</p>
      <p>Miles of Maine nature trails provide the perfect place to snowshoe, cross country ski, or just enjoy the pristine beauty of snowfall with a sleigh ride. </p>
      <p>Southern Maine is known for long, sandy Goose Rocks Beach and smaller Arundel Beach, and in winter you can walk along the shore, without crowds. Other sites to visit, year-round include the Seashore Trolley Museum; and rustic, stone St. Ann’s Episcopal Church, with ocean views. The 1833 Goat Island Lighthouse sits in the harbor of quaint lobster-fishing village Cape Porpoise.</p>
      <p>The following upscale Kennebunkport lodgings, open throughout winter, are reason enough to consider an off-season getaway:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.boathouseme.com/"><b>The Boathouse</b></a><b>:</b> Located in the heart of Kennebunkport with stunning views and luxurious accommodations, this ultimate waterfront hotel overlooks the harbor side of the Kennebunk River and is home to Boathouse Waterfront Restaurant, with a raw bar for all seasons. </p>
      <p><a href="https://capearundelinn.com/"><b>Cape Arundel Inn &amp; Resort</b></a><b>: </b>One of the most luxurious hotels in Kennebunkport, Maine offers shimmering ocean views, exquisitely prepared cuisine, and the delicious kind of sleep that follows days spent by the sea.</p>
      <p>The landmark <b>Main House </b>is on Kennebunkport’s exclusive Ocean Avenue and open-year round - the kind of gracious, oceanfront Victorian Maine mansion that vacationers envision. The front porch and sloping lawn overlook the Atlantic; its rooms and suites offer contemporary comfort and historic charm.</p>
      <p>New this year is the <a href="https://capearundelinn.com/ivy-cottage/">I<b>vy Cottage</b></a><b>.</b> with an open concept kitchen and dining room, hardwood floors and vaulted ceilings with skylights. Room for six to sink into overstuffed chairs in the living room and get cozy by a roaring fire, or restore on the tranquil front porch with morning coffee or a glass of wine.  </p>

      <p>With the on-site <b>Art Collector Maine Art Hill</b>, travelers can indulge in artistic tones of saffron, cream, and silver create a welcoming, stylish environment that invites relaxation. Marble bathrooms and plush Frette and Cuddledown linens further enhance comfort.</p>
      <p><a href="https://kennebunkportinn.com/"><b>Kennebunkport Inn</b></a><b>:</b> Built in the late 1890’s, the historical Kennebunkport Inn overlooks downtown’s shops, restaurants, and galleries, an easy walk to the most popular destinations in town.</p>

      <p>And for those who like to experience the unexpected, this winter, the <b>Burleigh</b>, inside the Kennebunkport Inn, will be featuring an<b> </b><i>Igloo Ice Lounge</i><b>,</b> complete with heated igloos on the deck and signature cocktails. </p>
