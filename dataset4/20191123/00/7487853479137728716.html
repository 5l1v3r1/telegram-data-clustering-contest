      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15366606" target="_blank">Spencer Rance</a></address>
      <p>​A struggling Aston Villa side host Newcastle in the Premier League this Monday as both sides look to climb away from the bottom three.</p>
      <p>Villa have lost their last three league games and have dropped to 17th, sitting precariously outside the relegation zone. Dean Smith will be wanting a good result this weekend to ease any sort of relegation fears.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Steve Bruce has led Newcastle to back-to-back Premier League wins, and impressively won at home to Bournemouth before the international break. The Magpies sit 13th in the table now, seven points clear of the bottom three.</p>
      <p>As the bottom of the <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier League</a> hots up, both teams are far from being safe and will be looking for three points to boost to their survival campaign.</p>
      <p>Villa need these three points, especially after losing three back-to-back. However, it will be a tough test against a Newcastle team which found another gear prior to the international break.</p>

      <h3>Team News</h3>
      <p>Aston Villa will be hugely boosted by the news that club captain Jack Grealish will return after four weeks out with a calf injury. Tom Heaton should also return after missing the defeat to Wolves, which saw replacement keeper Jed Steer tear his Achilles.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>Bjorn Engels and Matt Targett will come back into a defence that has been struggling recently after overcoming their respective injuries. However, the Villans will be without both Jota and Keinan Davis, who are suffering from hernia and hamstring injuries.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/newcastle">​Newcastle</a> have quite a few injury and suspension problems - especially at the back. Jamaal Lascelles fractured his tibia and will be unavailable until the new year, while Ciaran Clark reported back from international duty with a knock. Newcastle are hoping Clark should be available to face his former club.</p>
      <p>Former Villa manager Steve Bruce has had Florian Lejeune and Fabian Schar back in training, which could offer the defensive support needed. Sean Longstaff completes his three game ban and winger Matt Ritchie remains sidelined with an ankle injury.</p>

      <h3>Head to Head Record</h3>
      <p>Going all the way back to 1895, Newcastle have had the edge over their counterparts – winning 71 of the 163 matchups, with Villa winning 55.</p>
      <p>More recently, too, the Toon Army have dominated the fixture and you have to go back to 2011 for the last time Villa won, a 1-0 victory at Villa Park thanks to a James Collins goal. </p>

      <p>Since then, both in the Premier League and <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/championship">​Championship</a>, Newcastle are unbeaten in their clashes with Villa. There have been 12 games, with an equal split of six wins and six draws.</p>
      <p>The last affair at Villa Park in 2016 ended in a 1-1 draw in September 2016 at the start of a Championship season which ended in Newcastle getting promoted.</p>

      <h3>Recent Form</h3>
      <p>As already mentioned, <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/aston-villa">​Villa</a> have been on a poor run of form prior to the international break and lost their last three games. To be fair to the Villans, these games were against Manchester City, Liverpool and Wolves, respectively. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Faston-villa-v-liverpool-fc-premier-league-5dd91da78317e29be2000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8888888888888888&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.049523809523809526&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Before that, Villa had beaten both Norwich and Brighton - both wins which could be key to their survival battle.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Newcastle have had a turn around in form winning their last two having won only twice in the opening ten games. These wins against West Ham and Bournemouth have seen Newcastle rise up to 13th in the table.</p>
      <p>Their form had been steadily improving even before those two wins, and they have collected ten points from a possible 15.</p>
      <p>Here are both sides' last five results.</p>

      <h3>Prediction</h3>
      <p>Both these sides will want to be clear of the relegation zone going into the busy festive period.</p>
      <p>Villa and Dean Smith, arguably, need this win more than the visitors - but Steve Bruce will be wanting to get one over his old side. Newcastle have shown improvement over the last few weeks and are defensively solid.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Jack Grealish could play a key part but with Villa lacking a bit of confidence and Newcastle coming off those back-to-back wins, expect a tight affair that will end in score draw.</p>
