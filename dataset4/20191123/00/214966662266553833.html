      <h1>Authorities identify bizarre new trend after Qld schoolies week </h1>

      <p>Week one of schoolies has wrapped up, with authorities reporting less arrests and hospitalisations than previous years, along with a <i>bizarre</i> new trend.</p>
      <p>The Safer Schoolies response has been working hard all week, to ensure all party-goers were kept safe and had a great time in Surfers Paradise.</p>
      <p>This morning, they’re proud to announce it’s been a hugely successful week once again, crediting smaller crowds and better education for the good statistics.</p>
      <p>Just over 15,500 school leavers descended on the Glitter Strip this past week, down approximately 27 percent on last year’s figures.</p>
      <p>Chairman of Safer Schoolies Mark Reaburn says they’ve also identified a peculiar new trend sweeping through this year’s graduates.</p>
      <p>“Proud to say the mullet is coming back!</p>
      <p>“The mullet was appearing on quite a number of boys.</p>
      <p>“We monitor the social media and the mullet is back… so welcome to schoolies 2019.</p>
      <p>“Will it progress to 2020? We’ll wait and see,” Mr Reaburn said.</p>
      <p>On a more serious note though, arrest and hospitalisation numbers have dropped considerably this year.</p>
      <p>460 schoolies patients were treated by paramedics, with just under 10 percent transported to hospital.</p>
      <p>Justin Payne from Queensland Ambulance says the emergency treatment centre was a success.</p>
      <p>“The patients that we saw through the emergency treatment centre were actually extremely polite and well behaved.</p>
      <p>“It was one of the better years as a response within our tent.</p>
      <p>“We had no issues will school leavers being aggressive or outlandish to paramedics.</p>
      <p>“So from our perspective, it was really well received, and great to treat young people in their environment and avoid going to hospital,” Mr Payne said.</p>
      <p>A very similar report from police who only arrested 42 schoolies over the week – mostly for cannabis possession – around half that of last year’s group.</p>
      <p>Chief Superintendent Craig Hanlon from Queensland Police said it was a very, very good schoolies year.</p>
      <p>“There’s always going to be a very small group that’s going to come to the attention of police… we’ve dealt with them, and we’ve all moved on.</p>
      <p>“The key from a police perspective and security perspective – is that there’ve been no acts of violence reported to us by schoolies.</p>
      <p>“There’ve been some people who’ve made some mistakes in how they’re managed themselves, but they’re on the lower scale of offending,” Chief Superintendent Hanlon said.</p>
