      <p>There’s no arguing that being able to wirelessly stream music to a speaker or audio system has been a huge win for music fans. However, not all wireless streaming is created equal, and not all audio systems include the feature. Bluetooth is the most common method — especially among portable wireless speakers — but it is a lossy format and range is limited. Wi-Fi streaming offers multiple advantages, including the ability to connect to a compatible speaker anywhere within range of the Wi-Fi network, and support for higher quality lossless audio. If your audio system doesn’t include this feature, it’s easy enough to add by plugging in an Amazon Echo or Google Home smart speaker. But what if you want to use Apple’s AirPlay? Apple doesn’t offer any dongles or inexpensive plug-in speaker solutions. But you can easily add AirPlay support to virtually any stereo system or powered speaker by picking up an Apple AirPort Express router...</p>

        <b>AirPort Express to the Rescue</b>
      </p>
      <p>Music streamed using Apple AirPlay sounds considerably better than Bluetooth audio. While Bluetooth involves compression of the music (lossy), AirPlay is a lossless format. In addition, while Bluetooth streaming typically has a range of 30 feet or so, you can stream music from an iPhone to an AirPlay speaker from anywhere on the same Wi-Fi network.  </p>
      <p>The problem is that not many speakers or audio systems ship with native AirPlay support and older stereos will lack wireless streaming options altogether. However, you can easily (and inexpensively) add high quality AirPort wireless streaming to any system with AUX input thanks to Apple’s discontinued Airport Express router.</p>

      <p>The Airport Express included a 3.5mm audio output jack with a mini-TOSLINK optical digital transmitter. And it supports AirPlay. This compact Wi-Fi router is about the size of a power brick, and although Apple discontinued it, they are easy to find second hand. Use a 3.5mm audio cable to connect your audio system to the AirPort Express, connect the Apple router to your Wi-Fi network, and you’re good to go. </p>
      <p>Here’s how to add AirPlay support to your audio system with an Apple AirPort Express.</p>
      <p>1. Buy an AirPort Express router. Unless you’re lucky, this will be used, but they are in plentiful supply through sites like eBay. I paid around $30 for one a few weeks ago. This is very important: <b>make certain you pick the A1264 version of the AirPort Express</b>. The original A1084 and A1088 versions look identical but will not work for AirPlay.</p>
      <p>2. Use Apple’s Airport Utility (macOS app and also available as an iOS app) to add the AirPort Express to your existing Wi-Fi network. From there, you will want check off Enable AirPlay and give the AirPlay speaker a name. For a full overview of configuring the AirPort Express, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201621">Apple Support provides a detailed walkthrough</a>. Wait for the AirPort Express to restart with the configuration changes. Once you see a green light on the router, it is ready to go.</p>

      <p>3. Use a 3.5mm audio cable to connect the Airport Express to the speaker or audio system’s AUX input.</p>
      <p>4. When you play music on your iPhone and select sources, you should now see that AirPlay speaker show up as an option. Select it and enjoy the high quality AirPlay wireless streaming!</p>

      <p>Note: Apple AirPlay 2 (which includes multi-room wireless audio) requires a more recent version of the AirPort Express, the A1392. This version was first released in 2012 and tends to sell for considerably more than earlier versions. If all you care about is adding AirPlay support to a single speaker, the earlier AirPort Express A1264 is a much cheaper and more compact solution. </p>
