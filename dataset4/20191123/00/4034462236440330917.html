      <h1>Is The Aston Martin DBX The Best Luxury SUV You Can Buy?</h1>
      <h2>How does the DBX stand up against the cream of the SUV crop?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:20:33+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 00:20</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Wright</a></address>
      <p>Aston Martin has been in business since 1913. In the late 1940s, the British automaker became mostly known for its expensively crafted grand touring models. When James Bond <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/james-bond-s-aston-martin-db5-just-sold-for-insane-money">drove onto the silver screen in a DB5</a> in the 1964 movie Goldfinger, Aston Martin became a British cultural icon, up there with Rolls Royce and Bentley. Since then, Aston has kept its place as an iconic badge in the industry with its sports and grand touring cars. Rolls Royce, Bentley, and the other luxury carmakers have taken their time to embrace the SUV and Aston Martin has taken even longer. However, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/aston-martin/dbx">Aston Martin DBX</a> is finally here and it's time to see how it stacks up against the competition.</p>

      <h3>Rolls Royce Cullinan</h3>
      <p>Rolls Royce was one of the companies people least expected to produce an SUV. But while the styling isn't everyone's favorite, and the Aston Martin DBX is much more palatable, the Rolls Royce delivers on outright opulence. Opulence is exactly where your extra $125,000 is going, with the Roller costing $325,000 versus the DBX's $189,900 price tag. The DBX has an excellent interior, but the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/rolls-royce/cullinan">Rolls Royce Cullinan</a>'s is a masterpiece.</p>

      <h3>Maserati Levante Trofeo</h3>
      <p>Maserati's SUV is quite comparable to the DBX, sporting big power from a 3.8-liter twin-turbo V8 and a high level of craftsmanship on the inside with sleek styling to match. The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/maserati/levante-trofeo">Levante Trofeo</a> punches out a little more power than the DBX though, producing 590 horsepower and 538 lb-ft of torque versus the 542 horses and 516 lb-ft from the Aston. The biggest thing the Aston Martin has over the Masarati is that it won't plummet in value the moment it drives from the dealer and out onto the road.</p>

      <h3>Mercedes-AMG G63</h3>
      <p>If there's one thing you can't accuse the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/restored-mercedes-g-wagen-is-so-much-cooler-than-a-new-one">G-Wagen</a> of, it's being pretty. If you want something obnoxious and in your face, it beats the DBX hands down, and its off-road prowess is the stuff of legend. The AMG fettered 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine lays down 577 horsepower and 627 lb-ft and will go anywhere it damn pleases. While the DBX should be a competent off-roader, it's unlikely to be able to go as deep into the wilderness as the G-Wagen.</p>

      <h3>Porsche Cayenne Turbo</h3>
      <p>The Cayenne paved the way for other premium brands to build SUVs by demonstrating that they can sell like hotcakes. The all-new SUV saved Porsche from some big financial woes and, ultimately, from being eaten up by Mercedes. It's sporty, a joy to drive, and premium on the inside. It comes with a 4.0-liter Twin-Turbo V8, 541 horsepower, 567 lb-ft at just 1960 rpm, and is comparable in power to the DBS. We think the DBS is prettier, has more brand cache if you want to impress at the golf club, but the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/porsche/cayenne-turbo-coupe">Cayenne Turbo S</a> starts at just $126,500.</p>

      <h3>Bentley Bentayga</h3>
      <p>Refined, luxurious, powerful, and British. The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bentley/bentayga">Bentley Bentayga</a> didn't have long to wait before Aston Martin came in as competition. At $165,000, the Bentley is less expensive but you can ramp the trim right up to Mulliner and drop $300,000 on four wheels. The Bentley also makes more of a statement with its sheer amount of presence on the road or in the parking lot. Its also huge, and that's in direct contrast to lighter weight DBX.</p>

      <h3>Range Rover SVAutobiography</h3>
      <p>Until Rolls Royce and Bentley unwrapped their SUVs, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/land-rover/range-rover">Range Rover</a> SVAutobiography was top of the tree. It still is if you want your SUV to be the best off-road while supremely comfortable and luxurious on the road. Here, the DBX is the sportier option but, for brute power, the Land Rover matches it with a supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 tuned to 557 hp and 516 lb-ft of torque, but slightly undercuts its British pal with a starting price of just under $178,000.</p>

      <h3>Lamborghini Urus</h3>
      <p>Lamborghini surprised everyone before they thought about it, shook their heads, and said, "Actually, that makes sense." The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/lamborghini/urus">Lamborghini Urus</a> is an obnoxious statement of style and power, and at $200,000 it's more expensive than the DBX, but you're getting a flat out performance SUV rather than something refined and sophisticated. We suspect very few people will be cross-shopping the DBX and Urus. More likely, they'll take one of each for whenever the moods take them.</p>
