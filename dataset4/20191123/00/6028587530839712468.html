      <p>Twenty of the spots at Euro 2020 have been decided, and the 16 teams in the play-offs found out who stands between them and one of the four remaining spots on Friday.Seven of those teams could make history by qualifying for the first time under their current political state, and the structure of the playoffs guarantees at least one team that has never qualified before will reach Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>The play-offs have given clubs who failed to qualify for Euro 2020 through the group stage a second chance, and as it is based on their Nations League results, a club could find themselves in the play-offs despite having a disastrous time during qualifying. Belarus, for example, picked up just 4 points in the group stage of qualifying and finished with a goal difference of minus 12.</p>
      <p>Twelve countries will host Euro 2020, and based on the results of the play-offs, it’s possible for five of the twelve hosts to not be playing in the tournament themselves. Two hosts definitely won’t be playing as Azerbaijan didn’t reach the play-offs, and Hungary and Romania are in the same play-off path.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Play-off Path D</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Georgia v Belarus, North Macedonia v Kosovo</i>
      </p>
      <p>The efforts made in the inaugural Nations League last year are finally paying off for teams in play-off path D, who have the chance of making history. None of the four sides in path D have ever qualified for the European Championships as independent nations.</p>
      <p>Kosovo and North Macedonia came closest this year, both finishing third in their groups. North Macedonia managed to beat Slovenia and Israel, while Kosovo, the lowest ranked team in the play-offs, took the Czech Republic right to the final round of matches, and were the first team since 2012 to score three goals in an away match against England. Their low FIFA ranking comes from Kosovo only starting to officially play international soccer three years ago, and they are a lot better than 114<sup>th</sup> in the world.</p>
      <p>Georgia’s head coach Vladimir Weiss once took Slovakia to the knockout rounds of the World Cup, and with recent draws against Denmark, Ireland and South Korea, Georgia must be feeling confident at home against a Belarus side that only picked up four points in the group stage. The winners of that match will also be at home in the play-off final.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Play-off Path C</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Scotland v Israel, Norway v Serbia</i>
      </p>
      <p>Serbia have been in recent world cups, but surprisingly haven’t reached the European Championships on the past four occasions. Their recent campaign fell apart after a 5-0 defeat to Ukraine in June which led to Mladen Krstajic’s sacking. With stars like Ajax’s Ballon d’Or nominee Dusan Tadic and Lazio midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, Serbia are probably the strongest side in Path C, but they face a tricky trip to Norway, who haven’t lost at home since 2016. Norway’s only loss in the group stage was a 2-1 defeat to Spain, but they’ve rescued a point in injury time on three occasions in the group stage, so there could be some late drama in their play-off games.</p>
      <p>Scotland met Israel in the Nations League last year, with a James Forrest hat-trick helping them win 3-2 at Hampden Park after losing 2-1 in Haifa. Israel have had a torrid qualifying campaign so far, finishing fifth out of six teams in Group G, but Scotland at least seem to have started to turn a corner after their 3-0 loss to Kazakhstan in their first group stage match effectively killed their chances before qualification had really begun.</p>
      <p>After their final group stage match, manager Steve Clarke said that he was very optimistic about his Scotland side, which includes Liverpool’s Andy Robertson and Aston Villa’s John McGinn, but should Scotland win against Israel, they’ll have to travel to Norway or Serbia, which would be a much tougher test.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Play-off Path B</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Bosnia and Herzegovina v Northern Ireland, Slovakia v Republic of Ireland</i>
      </p>
      <p>Based on FIFA’s current rankings, Path B is actually more difficult than Path A. It could also throw up an all-Irish final between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, should both sides win their semi-finals. Northern Ireland certainly didn’t get much luck in the group stages, facing Germany and the Netherlands in their qualifying group. Their long-time boss Michael O’Neil, who has recently joined Stoke City, will be back with Northern Ireland for the play-offs.</p>
      <p>The Republic of Ireland could have qualified automatically if they had won their final game against Denmark. As it was, they drew one-all and now have to travel to Slovakia in the play-offs. Slovakia also came close in the group stage, missing out on an automatic qualifying spot by a single point. Bosnia and Herzegovina have never qualified for the European Championships, and will be hoping that home advantage in both legs can help them make history.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Play-off Path A</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Iceland v Romania, Bulgaria v Hungary</i>
      </p>
      <p>Iceland’s run to the quarter-finals of Euro 2016 was one of the stories of the tournament. They kept up that success by qualifying for the 2018 World Cup, but since then have struggled to find form, going a whole year without winning at one point. Romania, the highest ranked team in the play-offs must fancy their chances of getting a result in Reykjavik.</p>
      <p>It took Bulgaria until their final match against an already qualified Czech Republic before they registered a win during the qualification group stage. They are probably the weakest team in Path A, but home advantage in both the semi-final and the potential final could help them scrape into Euro 2020.  </p>
