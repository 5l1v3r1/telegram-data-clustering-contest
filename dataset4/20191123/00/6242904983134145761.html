        <b>Asante Kotoko have selected a total of 40 players for its youth team after five days of auditioning at the club's Adako Jachie training ground.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The list which is made up of 30 outfield players and ten goalkeepers will form the nucleus of the team after more than 400 youngsters showed up.</p>
      <p>A club statement read: ''30 players and 10 goalkeepers picked after our justify-your-inclusion exercise this week. They will go through another phase of screening from Monday afternoon.''</p>
      <p>Asante Kotoko wants to meet a CAF Club Licensing Regulation, which requires clubs to have a youth system for U15s and U19s.</p>
      <p>The club previously had a youth team but was dissolved in 2018 by Executive Chairman Dr Kwame Kyei.</p>
