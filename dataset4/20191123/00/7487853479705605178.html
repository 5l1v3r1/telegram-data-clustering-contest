      <h1>Twitter Reacts as Manchester City Come From Behind to Leapfrog Chelsea Into Third</h1>

      <p>Manchester City bounced back from the defeat to Liverpool with a big win at the Etihad, beating Chelsea 2-1 on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>After a damaging defeat to Liverpool at Anfield, Manchester City knew that they had to bounce back. The Citizens went into Saturday's huge match in fourth and a massive 12 points off leaders Liverpool, who had just sealed a late 2-1 win at Crystal Palace earlier in the day.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Chelsea were searching for their eighth consecutive away win of the season at a ground where they were thrashed 6-0 last season. Frank Lampard's side looked to also move four points clear of City, and go level on points once again with second place Leicester.</p>
      <p>It was Chelsea who broke the deadlock in Manchester, thanks to the fit again N'Golo Kante. His midfield partner Mateo Kovacic passed it up to the Frenchman, who was there to simply roll it past the onrushing Ederson in goal to open the scoring in style and put the Blues ahead.</p>

      <p>Manchester City responded soon after with a big equaliser, albeit with a huge stroke of luck. Former Chelsea man Kevin de Bruyne got the ball on the edge of the box, and his goalbound shot took a wicked deflection off Fikayo Tomori as it found its way into the goal.</p>

      <p>The Citizens came from a goal down to take the lead not long before half time, as Riyad Mahrez got his name on the scoresheet. The Algerian glided through the Chelsea defence, cutting in on his left foot and threading it through beyond Kepa Arrizabalaga to put City in front.</p>

      <p>While both teams were energetic in attack, it was poor defending that made the game so open. City's defending was woeful for Chelsea's only goal of the game, but it was the Blues' defending throughout the game that was evidently lacklustre and eventually costly for Chelsea.</p>

      <p>The result is huge in terms of the <a href="https://www.90min.com/categories/premier-league">​Premier League</a> table, as City leapfrog Chelsea into third place. Pep Guardiola's side are now nine points off the top and one point off second place Leicester, while the Blues are down in fourth and 11 points off Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Oh yeah, and there was some late VAR, because of course there was. </p>

Manchester City welcome Shakhtar Donetsk to the Etihad next Tuesday, while Chelsea meet Valencia at the Mestalla the following day.</p>
