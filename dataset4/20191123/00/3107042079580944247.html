      <h1>Former addict wants action against dealers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.odt.co.nz/author/adam.burns%40odt.co.nz" target="_blank">Adam Burns</a></address>
      <p>An Alexandra man and former drug addict says he is angered by the influence of methamphetamine (P) dealers who he believes are preying on small communities.</p>
      <p>Toni Jarvis (58) wants to consolidate support from residents in the Central Otago town and proposes a community meeting be held to tackle the issue.</p>
      <p>"I'm not interested in stomping on people who have an addiction - they need support.</p>
      <p>"My problem is these mongrel, low-life dealers that are coming here to make massive amounts of money out of the misery of my little community."</p>
      <p>Mr Jarvis was appointed to the survivor advisory group for the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Historical Abuse in Care earlier this year, following years of abuse and drug addiction.</p>
      <p>Central Otago sub-area supervisor Senior Sergeant Clint Wright said police were working hard to combat the issue, which was widespread.</p>
      <p>"Like in most communities, we have noticed an increase in drug-related harm but as always we are committed to preventing and investigating drug use and drug dealing in our communities."</p>
      <p>He said there had been a small rise in petty crime in and around Alexandra.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of residents on a Facebook community group have praised Mr Jarvis' efforts to take the initiative on the issue.</p>
      <p>A group administrator said the issue extended to other towns in the region, including Cromwell, Wanaka and Queenstown.</p>
      <p>Alexandra resident Billy Te Wake (38) is a member of the Anti-P Ministry group and struggled with an addiction to the drug for many years.</p>
      <p>"I've seen what it does, I have lived that life."</p>
      <p>"I'm tired of seeing people burying their kids, burying their best friends, burying their family."</p>
      <p>Central Otago Mayor Tim Cadogan expressed doubt as to whether a community meeting was the best approach.</p>
      <p>"Having read Facebook posts on the topic lately ... such a meeting might produce a lot more heat than illumination.</p>
      <p>"However, if the services at the forefront of this battle feel there is benefit to such a meeting I would, of course, support one."</p>
      <p>Mr Cadogan said services for users and family members alongside community education were the key needs.</p>
