        <i>Tesla’s chief designer smashed the vehicle’s windows in an attempt to demonstrate their toughness</i>
      </p>
      <p>Does the act of someone’s net worth plummeting make an actual sound?</p>
      <p>If so, then for Elon Musk it would be the <i>thonk</i> of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/22/cybertruck-tesla-unveils-the-pickup-truck-we-have-to-have">a metal ball splintering </a>the purportedly unbreakable glass of his long-awaited cybertruck.</p>
      <p>Thursday’s unveiling of Tesla’s<b> </b>latest electric vehicle hit a snag when the company’s chief designer smashed the vehicle’s windows while attempting to demonstrate their durability. Tesla’s share price subsequently plummeted 6%, bringing Musk’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hayleycuccinello/2019/11/22/elon-musk-net-worth-cybertruck/#6dbc440e73aa">personal net worth down by $768m</a> in a single day, according to Forbes.</p>
      <p>“It is literally bulletproof to a 9mm handgun,” Musk said of the cybertruck, moments before the design chief, Franz von Holzhausen, went on to demonstrate not once, but twice, that the windows could break because a man threw a ball at them.</p>
      <p>“It didn’t go through, that’s the plus side,” Musk said.</p>
      <p>Musk had previously described the vehicle as a “really futuristic-like cyberpunk, Blade Runner pickup truck”. But the overall reaction to its design has not been kind, with many laughing at its almost cartoonishly large, video game-like features.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t the first time Musk’s theatrics have sent his company’s share price tumbling. Tesla’s shares took a similar 6% hit a year ago, when Musk decided to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/07/tesla-chief-elon-musk-smokes-marijuana-on-live-web-show">smoke marijuana on a live web show</a>.</p>
      <p>At the time, Musk called the Guardian “the most insufferable newspaper on planet Earth” in response to a question about the wisdom of smoking marijuana while he was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/15/elon-musks-tweets-investigated-for-possibly-breaking-law-reports">under investigation by the SEC</a> for tweeting that he had “secured” funding to take Tesla private.</p>
      <p>For what it’s worth, he claimed his team had successfully tested the stunt ahead of the launch, and that the windows had not shattered.</p>

      <p>But with Musk’s net worth still estimated at more than $20bn, perhaps he can afford to keep breaking things.</p>
