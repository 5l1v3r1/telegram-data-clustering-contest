      <h1>Pep Guardiola Provides Update on His Manchester City Future Amid Exit Rumours</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15213495" target="_blank">Matt O'Connor-Simpson</a></address>
      <p>​Pep Guardiola has insisted that he is happy in his role as Manchester City manager and hinted that he may stay at the club beyond when his current deal expires at the end of the 2020/2021 season. </p>
      <p>By their own high standards, City have endured a challenging start to the season, with a recent 3-1 loss to Liverpool representing their third defeat of the campaign so far.</p>

      <p>They currently trail the table-topping <a href="http://90min.com/teams/liverpool">​Reds</a> by nine place and this - combined with the fact that his wife and daughter have moved out of Manchester - has fuelled speculation that Guardiola would depart the club at the end of his contract. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6499545-pep-guardiola-s-agent-breaks-silence-on-man-city-future-amid-rumours-of-bayern-return">​Bayern Munich</a> and a <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6493321-pep-guardiola-opens-door-to-italy-move-as-manchester-city-contract-reaches-critical-point">​club in Italy</a> have both been suggested as possible destinations but speaking before his side's game against Chelsea on Saturday, the former Barcelona boss repeatedly stated that he was more than happy to remain in charge at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p>"If the people say, ‘Do I want to stay?’, I want to stay. I don’t have any reasons to move from here," Guardiola proclaimed as reported by <a href="https://theathletic.com/1401562/2019/11/22/pep-press-conference-2230/">​The Athletic.</a></p>

      <p>"I am incredibly satisfied to work with this club, with these players, and if the people believe I am going to resign or be sacked for these results and (being) nine points behind, the people doesn’t know me, they don’t know me.</p>
      <p>"I love the challenge. I like to be in this position. And if the club wants [me] next season, I want to be here, 100 per cent. I want to live in this city because I know lovely people here and I want to work and live with them and I want to be here."</p>

      <p>Guardiola also alluded to his possible interest in remaining at <a href="http://90min.com/teams/manchester-city">​City</a> beyond the expiration of his current deal next season. </p>
      <p>"I’m incredibly satisfied to work in this city and this club and I want to help this club to get better. I still enjoy working with these players a lot and I would like to stay longer. I would like to stay longer. If the club wants, I will stay," the Spaniard exclaimed. </p>
