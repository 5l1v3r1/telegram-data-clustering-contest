      <h1>Indicted Netanyahu fights for future</h1>

      <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's indictment on corruption charges prompted speculation on Friday that the end of his decade-long tenure as 'King Bibi' is nigh. The Jewish state woke up to an indicted sitting prime minister for the first time, after the country's attorney general announced late on Thursday he had charged the 70-year-old with bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. <br/><br/>After months of speculation Avichai Mandelblit's decision was the worst possible outcome for Netanyahu, hitting him with the most serious charges. <br/><br/>Israel's longest-serving premier swiftly hit back, vowing to fight on and accusing the police and legal system of bias against the right-wing in an often angry speech. Any trial is likely months away, and - if Netanyahu is found guilty - a final conviction exhausting appeals could take years. But his political authority is now under more intense scrutiny than ever. <br/><br/>Israel has been without a functioning government for nearly a year, with Netanyahu staying on in an interim capacity after two inconclusive elections in April and September.Parliament has less than three weeks to find a candidate that can gain the support of more than half of the 120 lawmakers, or a deeply unpopular third election will be called. The charges against him range from receiving gifts worth thousands of dollars to a deal to change regulation in favour of a media group in exchange for positive coverage. afp</p>
