      <p>PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. – A dog in Florida <a href="https://bit.ly/2XEjJbW">went on joy ride </a>Thursday, driving a car around a cul-de-sac. In circles. In reverse.</p>
      <p>According to Port St. Lucie police, as officers responded to reports of a dog locked in a 2003 silver Mercury Sable “circling the cul-de-sac while in the reverse gear.”</p>
      <p>Investigators learned the car owner made a wrong turn on his way home, said Senior Sgt. Lisa Marie Carrasquillo, police spokeswoman.</p>
      <p>The driver got out and shut the door, leaving the dog inside.</p>
      <p>“The dog named Max accidentally hit the shifter into reverse, causing the car to circle the cul-de-sac, leaving the owner locked out of the car,” police stated. “As the car circled the cul-de-sac, it struck and damaged a mailbox.”</p>
      <p>Carrasquillo said Max apparently was driving for several minutes.</p>
      <p>Carrasquillo said the driver provided an extra key fob, but the battery was dead.</p>
      <p>Police wound up entering the code on the key pad of the door.</p>
      <p>“The dog is happy and fine,” Carrasquillo said Friday.</p>
      <p>Max, who apparently wasn’t wearing a seatbelt, did not get a citation.</p>
      <p>There were no injuries reported.</p>
