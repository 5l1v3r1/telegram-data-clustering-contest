      <p>The three LaDMA metro guards captured on video taking bribes have been suspended, 3news.com has gathered.</p>
      <p>They are to face stiffer sanctions pending the conclusion of investigations.</p>
      <p>“If we find out [that] to be true possibly they can be sacked.”</p>
      <p>This was disclosed by the Chief Executive of La Dadekotopon Municipal Assembly (LaDMA), Reverend Solomon Kotey Nikoi in an interview on TV3’s Midday Live on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The three were filmed by the 3FM Community Connect team on Monday, November 18 on the pedestrian walkway near the Accra Mall.</p>
      <p>The undercover report was as a result of persistent complaints from pedestrians about the growing number of street hawkers and squatters in the area.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the LaDMA MCE pleaded for more time to allow him to clear the squatters and hawkers since he is new in office.</p>
