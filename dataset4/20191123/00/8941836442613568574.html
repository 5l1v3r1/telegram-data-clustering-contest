      <p>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission has set a Nov. 30 deadline for public comments on potential changes to duck zone and goose unit boundaries.</p>
      <p>Federal authorities allow changes to duck zone boundaries every five years, and Game and Parks has paired this with goose unit boundary changes.</p>
      <p>Duck zones and goose units let states coordinate duck and goose migration patterns and hunter preferences with hunting season dates for different areas within states.</p>
