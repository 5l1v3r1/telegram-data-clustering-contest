      <p>Irish boy band Westlife <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/11/22/uk-boy-band-westlife-snag-their-eighth-no-1-album-with-spectrum/">controls the U.K. albums chart this week</a> with their new album <i>Spectrum</i>, which racked up enough equivalent units to become their eighth ruler in the country. Behind the incredibly popular vocal group, a number of fellow newly-released titles blast onto the ranking and find their way into the top 10, returning many beloved figures to the region.Debuting at No. 2 is Celine Dion’s <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/courage-deluxe-edition/1480315784"><i>Courage</i></a>, her latest collection of original material. The Canadian vocalist breaks into the top 10 for the twelfth time in her lengthy career. 10 of those successes are proper albums, while the other two are compilations of some of her greatest hits. So far, none of the singles released from <i>Courage</i> have charted, but that hasn’t stopped her from rising almost all the way to the top.</p>
      <p>After starting in the runner-up slot last frame, Alfie Boe and Michael Ball only fall one rung with <i>Back Together</i>, their third collection as a pair. Lewis Capaldi’s shockingly successful debut LP <i>Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent</i> lifts from No. 8 to No. 4 this week.</p>
      <p>Fellow all-male vocal group Take That are back in the top 10 with their new live effort, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/odyssey-greatest-hits-live-live/1481097953"><i>Odyssey: Greatest Hits Live</i></a>, which launches at No. 5. The set, which follows the immediate success of 2018’s hits compilation <i>Odyssey</i> (which became the band’s eighth No. 1 in the U.K.), is Take That’s lucky thirteenth top 10 in the U.K. It’s also their second live album to reach the highest tier on the tally.</p>
      <p>Ed Sheeran’s <i>No.6 Collaborations Project</i> dips to sixth place from fifth, though it will likely rebound in time.</p>
      <p>The latest addition to the Kidz Bop franchise, <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/kidz-bop-2020/1482049567"><i>Kidz Bop 2020</i></a>, opens at No. 7, proving that there is still a market for renditions of the biggest songs on the planet geared toward young people.</p>
      <p>He’s spent decades as a footballer, a manager in the sport and a presenter on TV talking about the game he knows so well, and now Chris Kamara can add charting musician to his resume. The multi-talented figure recently released his first holiday album, <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/heres-to-christmas/1484090226"><i>Here’s to Christmas</i></a>, and it lands at No. 8 after its first full frame of availability.</p>
      <p>George Michael and Wham! (which is a bit of an odd phrasing, considering Michael was one-half of Wham!) narrowly missed the top 10 on the albums chart <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/11/19/elo-david-bowie-and-george-michael-5-releases-making-waves-on-the-uk-albums-chart/">last week</a> with <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/george-michael-wham-last-christmas-original-motion/1482275462"><i>Last Christmas</i></a>, the soundtrack that accompanies the film of the same title, which gets its name from the duo’s famous holiday tune. Now that Christmas is a bit closer, the two inch upwards, moving from No. 11 to No. 9. The set is Wham!’s fifth top 10 in the country and Michael’s ninth under his own name (and his thirteenth when including his work with Wham!).</p>
      <p>Closing out the highest tier this time around is hip-hop and R&amp;B superstar Tory Lanez, whose new release <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/chixtape-5/1486710711"><i>Chixtape 5</i></a> begins at No. 10. The album is just his second to enter the highest area on the list, following the No. 8 peak of 2018’s <i>Memories Don't Die</i>.</p>
      <p>One proper single and two other tracks featured on the project have made their way to the songs ranking so far. Lead cut “Jerry Sprunger” (yes, that’s spelled correctly), which features T-Pain, jumps into the top 40 for the first time and settles at No. 32 as the album premieres. Fellow <i>Chixtape 5 </i>cuts “The Take” with Chris Brown and “Beauty in the Benz” with Snoop Dogg debut at Nos. 47 and 70, respectively.</p>
