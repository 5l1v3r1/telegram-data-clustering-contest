      <p><a href="https://www.derbygrammar.org/">Derby Grammar School</a> student, Tom Weeks, is celebrating another successful golf season, and he has his sights firmly set on joining the US <a href="https://www.pgatour.com/">PGA Tour</a> in the future.</p>
      <p>Tom, aged 14 from Burton on Trent, started playing golf at the age of 6 with his dad and joined the county coaching sessions for the under 14s when he was aged 10.</p>
      <p>He now plays with a handicap of 5 and has represented Derbyshire County every year since 2015, currently playing for both the under 16 and under 18 teams.</p>
      <p>This season alone he has won the Derbyshire U18 Boys Matchplay competition, U14 Boys County Championships, the Derbyshire U14 Short Course Championship, was part of the U18 team winning Midlands Champions and most recently was part of the U16 team that won the Ten Counties Competition at Kedleston Golf Club.</p>
      <p>Tom said: “I’ve got to where I am through coaching and practice. I practise five or six times a week, I go to the gym to work on my strength and I have a strength and conditioning coach. I also play every Saturday and Sunday.</p>
      <p>"I use my lunchtime break at school to complete my homework so that I have time to practice and work on my game.</p>
      <p>"My aim after A Levels is to complete a golf scholarship in the USA and then hopefully join the US tour.”</p>
      <p>Mr Whitworth, Head of Games and PE at <a href="https://www.derbygrammar.org/">Derby Grammar School</a> said: “We are very proud of Tom and his achievements. From a school perspective we support him as much as possible so that he can combine his successful golf career with a sound academic education.</p>
      <p>"We are looking forward to following his progress over the coming years.”</p>
