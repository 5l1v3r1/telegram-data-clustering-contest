      <p>LONDON (AP) - Alexandre Lacazette rescued an injury-time English Premier League point for Arsenal at home to struggling Southampton but the 2-2 draw on Saturday did little to ease the pressure on coach Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>The Gunners boss was given public backing by the club hierarchy during the international break but he was reliant on a Lacazette brace to twice bring his side from behind.</p>
      <p>The south-coast side looked on course to win a league game at Arsenal for the first time since 1987 after James Ward-Prowse tapped home in the 71st after having a penalty saved by Bernd Leno.</p>
      <p>Lacazette’s first goal in the 18th followed Danny Ings’ opener for the visitors.</p>
      <p>Arsenal is winless in six games across all competitions with just two victories in their last 11 league games.</p>

      <p>For Ralph Hasenhuttl’s Saints, this would have been a much-needed morale boost but they have not won in the league since Sept. 14, and are 19th in the 20-team league.</p>
      <p>Arsenal stuck by Emery but the jeers which greeted the fulltime whistle suggested the majority of supporters may soon be calling for a change.</p>
