      <p>SAN DIEGO (AP) — Matt Mitchell scored 12 of his 18 points in the second half and had a hand in two sweet plays that helped San Diego State beat Long Island 81-64 Friday night to remain undefeated.</p>
      <p>Jordan Schakel scored 15 and had three big 3-pointers in the second half for SDSU (5-0), while Yanni Wetzell and Malachi Flynn scored 13 apiece. Flynn had 10 assists.</p>
      <p>Tyrn Flowers scored 15 for LIU (1-4).</p>
      <p>The Aztecs outscored LIU 18-10 in the final six minutes, with Mitchell, Flynn and Schakel leading the way.</p>
      <p>The run started when Mitchell stole the ball and passed to Flynn, who found Wetzell for a reverse layup for a 65-54 lead.</p>
      <p>Mitchell hit three shots down the stretch, Flynn had consecutive 3-pointers and Schakel hit the last of his three 3-pointers in the half and fourth overall.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the second half, Flynn flashed through the key, took a pass from Mitchell on the baseline and dished to Wetzell for a slam dunk and a 54-44 lead.</p>
      <p>It was the second game in double digits for Wetzell, a senior transfer from Vanderbilt. The big New Zealander was coming off career-highs of 20 points and 12 rebounds in a 66-49 win against San Diego on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>The Aztecs got three straight 3-point shots during an 11-0 run in the first half that gave them control. KJ Feagin, Schakel and Mitchell each connected from behind the arc and Aguek Arop then hit a long jumper for a 17-7 lead. SDSU’s biggest lead was 28-15 after Joel Mensah hit a jumper with 8:53 before halftime.</p>
      <p>SDSU led 38-32 at halftime.</p>
      <p>Jashaun Agosto and Raiquan Clark each scored 10 points for LIU of the Northeast Conference.</p>
      <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>LIU: The Sharks were hurt by four early turnovers but briefly took the lead at 7-6 after Julian Batts hit a 3-pointer. They then quickly fell behind by double digits.</p>
      <p>San Diego State: The Aztecs are 5-0 for the first time since 2014-15, when they went to the NCAA Tournament. They’ve played in the postseason only twice since then, in the NIT in 2016 and the NCAAs in 2018.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>LIU continues a long stretch away from home when it plays at Texas Tech on Sunday. It will then play in the Las Vegas Invitational.</p>
      <p>San Diego State hosts Tennessee State on Monday night.</p>
