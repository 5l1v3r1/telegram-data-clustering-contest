      <p>A <a href="https://www.liquorama.net/toscolo-chianti-classico-docg-2016.html">bold Italian wine</a> made from 100% Sangiovese grapes, the wine is a bright red color and rich and flavorful. While this one will work as a perfect all-around dinner wine, it’s also great to pair with the cheese or pasta course, or dessert.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Monte Antico Toscana IGT</b>
      </p>

      <p>Another fabulous Italian wine, <a href="https://www.totalwine.com/wine/red-wine/sangiovese/monte-antico-rosso/p/8859750">this one</a> is 85% Sangiovese, 5% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is a dark ruby color, with flavors of black cherries, licorice and plums. It’s a great choice for those who want a medium to full-bodied palate – and it has a bit of a spicy feel to it that will hold up against hearty meat and pasta dishes. </p>

      <p>We all love Pinot Noir, but you have you tasted it from Alto Adige, Italy? “This Northeastern region of Italy has its founding origins in the Austria-Hungarian empire and most of its inhabitants speak German. Almost every car zipping around is a BMW or a Mercedes, and that Austrian influenced attention-to-detail inherent in the region really helps the cultivation of such a fickle grape. Put a little chill on it and serve with a deep-fried or smoked turkey at Thanksgiving or even game hen, veal, or venison,” said <a href="https://www.instagram.com/matthewjkaner/?hl=en">Matthew Kaner</a>, co-founder of Bar Covell and Augustine and one of Wine Enthusiast Magazine's 40 Under 40 Tastemakers 2019.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wine.com/product/elena-walch-ludwig-pinot-nero-2013/420366">Elena Walch Ludwig Pinot Nero</a> $42</p>

      </figure>
      <p>This wine is an intense ruby red in color varietal. A glass of <a href="https://www.wine.com/product/antinori-villa-antinori-chianti-classico-riserva-2013/207827">Villa Antinori 2013 </a>has notes of red fruit that’s spicy with a touch of balsamic. This will be great with the turkey and trimmings or to enjoy as the night goes on.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Terrazas de los Andes Reserva Malbec 2017 </b>
      </p>

      <p>Another <a href="https://www.wine.com/product/terrazas-de-los-andes-reserva-malbec-2017/527364">rich and hearty red wine</a>, this one has very intense colors, with aromas of fresh fruit, flowers, and spices. Enjoy this all night long (especially as the conversations get more intense. We’ve all been there!)</p>
