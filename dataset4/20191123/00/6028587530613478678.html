      <p>It’s rare that I’ll make an argument for something that will actively make my life more annoying, but at this point, I’m starting to believe that it might be a good idea for <i>The Walking Dead</i> to stop giving out episode screeners to critics. Which would include me.Why? Well, first you have to understand why screeners exist in the first place. It’s like getting an early review copy of a video game. Critics get access to episodes of a show before they air so they can prep preview and review coverage around when the actual episode airs. There’s an understanding that you’re not going to post the review of an episode before it airs, unless you’re specifically told a spoiler-free preview review is cool, and the concept works. The network gets timely, consistent coverage for a show, the critic gets to release thoughts exactly when they’re relevant without waiting for the actual airing and scrambling to get the first review up for clicks.</p>
      <p>And yet sometimes this goes wrong, like how <i>Game of Thrones</i> eventually had to stop giving out screeners for critics because of leaks. And the same thing has been happening to <i>The Walking Dead</i> for years now, and it’s getting kind of annoying.</p>
      <p>There is quite literally an entire fansite built around spoiling <i>The Walking Dead</i> called The Spoiling Dead Fans, or TSDF. While sometimes they get inside information or secret set snaps, the majority of their coverage is someone either with the site who has access to screeners, or someone they know who has access to screeners, who every single week writes a massive article a few days early (screeners usually go out on Wednesday) spoiling every aspect of the episode. I know this is based on screener access because I am watching the same episodes as them, and there is literally no other way they could get this level of information. They are never wrong because they are watching the full episode, or talking to someone who has.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thewalkingdead/comments/dzrugu/tsdf_qa_episode_108_the_world_before/">Here’s an example</a> of one of those for this week’s midseason finale (obviously full of ten million <b>spoilers</b>). Every week on reddit they do a Q and A explaining every detail of the episode early. This results in a huge chunk of the fanbase knowing exactly what’s coming, and we get things like people spamming comments on social media under tweets or Instagram posts with spoilers that come from these revelations directly. Or in this week’s case (<b>mild spoilers</b>) they take the air out of the midseason finale by saying it doesn’t have a big “moment” that people were expecting. In the past, they’ve spoiled things like the exact list of all the heads that ended up on pikes in one of the biggest moments in series history.</p>

      <p>It’s gotten so bad and widely known among the <i>Walking Dead</i> cast and crew that Chandler Riggs actually wrote a personal letter to TSDF in order to pretty much beg them not to spoil the fact that his character died back in season 8. They agreed to that request, and yet every single cast member isn’t going to write a letter every time they don’t want something about them spoiled, and weirdly, by agreeing to Chandler’s request, they are acknowledging what they’re doing is harmful and bad for the show. Cool, you listened to Chandler because he personally reached out, but what about every other actor, director or writer that wanted their own moments to be a surprise? Yet TSDF ruins them every week.</p>
      <p>It seems like the only way to deal with TSDF would be to simply cut off screener access for <i>all</i> critics, because we can’t know for sure how they’re getting their information. If this was a blanket ban it would cut me off too, but at this point, I’m not sure what else AMC is supposed to do. Maybe reset everyone’s access and just let a scarce handful of critics back in who they deem trustworthy enough.</p>
      <p>I guess I don’t even fully blame TSDF for posting information they’re given, because they’re not journalists, they’re just random internet fans, so they can do what they want and aren’t bound to any particular code or embargo system. Yet I think it makes the show actively worse when we get a massive 1,200 word spoiler dump every single week before airing, which trickles its way into social media and can spoil the show for fans who aren’t even searching out spoilers. It’s high time to figure out how to kill this, at least in terms of spoiler sources with screener access.</p>
