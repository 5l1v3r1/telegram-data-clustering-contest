      <p>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Utah overcame a flurry of turnovers with excellent shooting, and that gave the Jazz just enough of a cushion to hold off a late Golden State rally.</p>
      <p>Donovan Mitchell scored 30 points and Mike Conley had 27 to help Utah beat the undermanned Warriors 113-109 on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Bojan Bogdanovic added 17 points for the Jazz, and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rudy-gobert/">Rudy Gobert</a> had 19 rebounds and seven blocks. Utah shot 51% from the field and outrebounded Golden State 48-37.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alec-burks/">Alec Burks</a> scored 20 points to lead the Warriors. Omari Spellmen added 18, while Glenn Robinson III and Ky Bowman chipped in 17 apiece.</p>
      <p>Golden State rallied from a 21-point deficit and cut it to 111-109 with 22.8 seconds left on back-to-back baskets from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alec-burks/">Burks</a> and Robinson. Mitchell and Conley each hit a free throw in the final seconds to seal the victory for Utah.</p>

      <p>“There’s disappointment in the fourth quarter and how we executed offensively and then the things that we can control, particularly transition defense,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said.</p>
      <p>Injuries left the short-handed Warriors with just eight available players. The Jazz took advantage of that limited depth early, connecting on 61% of their field goal attempts in the first half.</p>
      <p>“If this was college and you only played two games in a week, you could do it without problem,” Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. “The number of games, the travel, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nba/">NBA</a> schedule, it wears on you and to do this with eight guys is tough.”</p>
      <p>Golden State managed to hang with Utah during the first quarter, and the Warriors twice took a one-point lead in the period. They went up 20-19 after <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alec-burks/">Burks</a> capped an 8-0 run with consecutive baskets and then claimed a 28-27 lead on a putback layup by Marquese Chriss.</p>

        <p>A four-point play from Mitchell helped start a 22-6 run that gave the Jazz a 60-43 lead in the second quarter. Bogdanovic finished off the spurt with back-to-back baskets.</p>
        <p>Golden State briefly cut the deficit to single digits in the third, trimming Utah’s lead to 69-60 on Eric Paschall’s dunk. Conley, Mitchell and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rudy-gobert/">Gobert</a> each made a basket over three straight possessions to boost Utah’s lead to 76-60.</p>
        <p>After the Jazz took a 100-80 lead on a 3-pointer from Emmanuel Mudiay early in the fourth quarter, the Warriors used a 21-6 run to cut the deficit to single digits again. Willie Cauley-Stein dunked the ball for his first basket to finish off the spurt and shave Utah’s lead to 106-101 with 2:19 left.</p>
        <p>“I thought they let their guard down a little bit in the fourth quarter when they got up 20,” Kerr said. “I’ve been around the league a long time - we’re not a team that people are going to get up for right now.”</p>
        <p>SCARY SITUATION</p>
        <p>Minutes after the game ended, the arena was evacuated because of a suspicious package discovered under a restaurant table. Police said the package turned out to be a toolbox, and the Jazz said employees were cleared by authorities to re-enter the building a couple of hours later.</p>
        <p>Salt Lake City police Lt. Carlos Valencia said the sellout crowd was already starting to leave when the evacuation began.</p>
        <p>Not long after both coaches finished answering postgame questions from the media, a spokesman for the Jazz told reporters to exit the building due to the suspicious package. Outside, they were directed by security to leave the premises.</p>
        <p>Utah players quickly headed for their cars in the parking lot - center <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rudy-gobert/">Rudy Gobert</a> was still in uniform as he left.</p>
        <p>Warriors players boarded their team bus.</p>
