      <p>Congress leader Ahmed Patel, who is camping in Mumbai in efforts to form a new coalition government, came to know about the Bharatiya Janata Party-Nationalist Congress Party coup only at around 7.30 am on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>In an exclusive conversation with <i><b><a href="http://Rediff.com/">Rediff.com</a></b></i>, Patel said, "This was very much expected. There is nothing new in their politics. <i>En logon ki </i>history <i>rahi hi</i> (<i>This has been the history of these people</i>)."</p>
      <p>The Congress is flabbergasted to watch the surprising swearing-in ceremony of BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis as Maharashtra chief minister and Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister.</p>
      <p>Patel said except the issue of the post of assembly speaker everything had been sorted out between the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress.</p>
      <p>Sharad Pawar himself proposed the legendary Maharashtra Congress leader Y B Chavan's death anniversary on November 25 for the swearing-in ceremony of the Sena-NCP-Congress government.</p>
      <p>But in an overnight coup, the NCP has abandoned the prospective political alliance to join the BJP.</p>
      <p>It is unlikely that Sharad Pawar was not aware of the political developements since the entire NCP legislature party has joined the BJP-led government.</p>
      <p>Also, Ajit Pawar is still under family patriarch Sharad Pawar's umbrella, so it is unlikely that he would do something so dramatic without his uncle's blessings.</p>
      <p>NCP leader Praful Patel called Ahmed Patel at 2 am this morning, but communication could not be established.</p>
