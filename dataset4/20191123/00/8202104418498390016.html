      <h3>A decision by an Ontario court on Friday means the City of Saskatoon will recover the entire <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/city-to-hold-urgent-media-conference">$1.04 million sent to a fraudster posing as a construction company executive.</a></h3>
      <p>City manager Jeff Jorgenson said in a news release that an Ontario Superior Court justice ordered that $335,000 be returned to the city.</p>

      <p>The final funds had been the subject of a court case in Toronto, where three parties claimed to be “unwitting victims” of the fraud, the news release states.</p>
      <p>Justice Michael Penny found that the three defendants had not provided enough evidence to warrant a trial. Penny had reserved his decision on Nov. 5.</p>
      <p>The defendants have 30 days to appeal the ruling. The money will be held in trust by the city’s lawyers until then. Penny also awarded the City of Saskatoon $25,000 in legal costs, the release said.</p>
      <p>Saskatoon Police Service spokeswoman Alyson Edwards said Friday in an email the case remains under investigation.</p>
      <p>City officials are finalizing the cost of recovering the money and expect to report to city council before the end of the year, Jorgenson said in the release.</p>
      <p>City hall has already installed “tighter accounting measures,” the release adds.</p>
      <p>In August, city hall sent $1.04 million to a bank account that was falsely believed to be that of the chief financial officer of a local company, Allan Construction Ltd.</p>
      <p>The money was supposed to be partial payment for work rehabilitating the Senator Sidney L. Buckwold Bridge.</p>
