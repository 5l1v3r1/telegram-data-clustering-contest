      <h1>Tottenham welcome back 'real' Alli as Mourinho reign begins with West Ham win</h1>

        <b>Dele Alli's display in Tottenham's 3-2 win over West Ham made Jose Mourinho look like the head coach Spurs have asked him to become.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Among the many knocks on <b>Jose Mourinho</b>'s often miserable stint at Manchester United was his inability or <b>unwillingness to perform real feats of coaching</b>, to coax improvement out of individuals who did not immediately meet his standard.</p>
      <p><b>Scott McTominay </b>was perhaps the one player who countered the claim that <b>a manager famed for distrusting young players</b> had indeed forgotten how to coach footballers of all ages.</p>
      <p>Diligent, dogged and pliable, it made sense that Mourinho <b>took to the late-blooming Scotland international</b> - and why the pair have remained in contact since the former's inglorious exit from Old Trafford almost 12 months ago.</p>
      <p>The rest of United's squad tended to <b>rebel against Mourinho's methods</b>. <b>Paul Pogba </b>stagnated. <b>Anthony Martial</b> failed to kick on. Others simply became sapped of belief, as must have been the case with the routinely chastised<b> Luke Shaw.</b></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> do not have the kind of funds to allow long-term assets to drift aimlessly - few clubs do - and it was notable that chairman<b> Daniel Levy bestowed the title of head coach</b> when offering Mourinho an unexpected return to the Premier League.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/b-ali-203578/">Dele Alli </a>is not exactly a McTominay type, and yet against West Ham, on the fourth day doing a job Mourinho once said he would never take,<b> there were signs he could become emblematic of the reinvention </b>the Portuguese claimed he did not need to undertake.</p>
      <p><b>Alli's confidence seemed completely restored </b>at the London Stadium on Saturday after more than a single season of form and injury issues that former boss Mauricio Pochettino struggled to resolve.</p>

      <p>Mourinho called him <b>"potentially a fantastic player"</b> during his introductory news conference and the scorer of 44 top-flight goals looked exactly that in a particularly encouraging first 45 minutes.</p>
      <p>Chosen ahead of Christian Eriksen in an advanced midfield role, he<b> twice rewarded Harry Kane runs </b>with intelligent passes in behind the defence during the opening stages of <b>Tottenham's eventual 3-2 victory</b>, their first on the road in the Premier League since January 20.</p>
      <p>One led to a rasping Kane finish that was disallowed for offside, but the hosts<b> </b>failed to heed the lesson as <b>Alli continued to find space</b> between the lines for the remainder of a one-sided opening half.</p>
      <p>The <b>recently outcast England international</b> harassed and forced an error out of Angelo Ogbonna, tested the obvious nerves of Hammers goalkeeper Roberto with a pair of shots and then, in the 43rd minute, offered the sort of instinctual manoeuvre that has so enamoured supporters in the past.</p>
      <p>His contortionist act and inventive flick when pinned on the touchline allowed<b> Son Heung-min</b> to spring free down the left and square for the recalled<b> Lucas Moura</b>, who tapped home.</p>
      <p>Alli had earlier supplied the pass from which <b>Son fired Spurs ahead </b>and his work was effectively complete by the time <b>Harry Kane headed in Serge Aurier's cross</b> four minutes after the interval.</p>
      <p><b>Mourinho made his appreciation clear </b>following the second goal, singling out the attacking midfielder with enthusiastic acknowledgement.</p>
      <p><b>Alli's influence waned in the second half,</b> as did Tottenham's performance, and West Ham grabbed late goals either side of his 79th-minute substitution to make the final scoreline look far closer than it needed to be.</p>
      <p>The job, however, was done. Spurs were winners, as<b> Levy has gambled on them becoming again</b> with a dramatic change. The 'real' Dele was back, as Mourinho had set to out accomplish. And a manager seemingly resistant to change looked like a head coach.</p>
