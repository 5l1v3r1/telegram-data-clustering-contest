      <p>Some of the recent <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/New-information-points-towards-the-lack-of-a-compact-Galaxy-S11e-model.442560.0.html">rumors</a> concerning the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Fresh-Samsung-Galaxy-S11-rumors-New-SAMOLED-display-108-MP-camera-and-several-color-options-on-the-anvil.442601.0.html">Samsung Galaxy S11</a> series indicate that it may lack an 'e' variant, as its predecessors did with the introduction of the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-S10e-Smartphone-Review.415212.0.html">S10e</a> last year. However, it seems OnLeaks did not get this memo, as the leaker's latest set of <a href="https://pricebaba.com/blog/samsung-galaxy-s11e-renders-360-degree-video-exclusive/amp">renders</a> are of this phone's second generation. This "S11e" looks quite different, however, in line with current theories on its specs and design language.</p>
      <p>First off, OnLeaks clearly <a href="https://pricebaba.com/blog/samsung-galaxy-s11e-renders-360-degree-video-exclusive/amp">believes that</a> the Samsung Galaxy S11e will stick with triple rear cameras next year, even though <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-design-of-the-Galaxy-S11-will-have-people-scratching-their-heads.444002.0.html">other variants</a> of its device line could have up to 5 each. The new renders show they are housed in a long module similar to that found in earlier rumor-based images of the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/New-Samsung-Galaxy-A51-renders-hint-at-a-punch-hole-display-quad-cameras-and-a-3-5mm-jack.442690.0.html">Galaxy A51</a> and <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Leaked-Samsung-s-Galaxy-A71-renders-show-quad-cam-setup.443922.0.html">A71</a>, as well as in existing phones such as the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-M30s.436624.0.html">Galaxy M30s</a>.Â </p>
      <p>Otherwise, the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Galaxy-S11-latest-rumor-points-to-8K-recording-and-20-9-aspect-ratio.443047.0.html">Samsung Galaxy S11</a>e is now <a href="https://pricebaba.com/blog/samsung-galaxy-s11e-renders-360-degree-video-exclusive/amp">depicted as</a> a device with a particularly premium-looking screen. It has a central punch-hole, as well as bezels that just fall away from the sides of the putative phone. It also gives the impression of being long and slim, hinting at a novel aspect-ratio such as 21:9 in the possible 2020 <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-so-called-Samsung-Galaxy-S10-Lite-gets-certified-by-the-FCC.443871.0.html">Galaxy S</a> device.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, these "Galaxy S11e" <a href="https://pricebaba.com/blog/samsung-galaxy-s11e-renders-360-degree-video-exclusive/amp">renders</a> are largely based on prior leaks rather than source material. OnLeaks also cites rumors that this device will start at 6GB of RAM, and have 128GB or 256GB in UFS 3.0 internal storage. Similarly, this phone is thought to upgrade to 4000mAh in terms of battery capacity, rather than 3100mAh in the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/One-UI-2-0-Android-10-arrives-on-the-Galaxy-S10-Galaxy-S10e-Galaxy-S10-and-Galaxy-S10-5G.438969.0.html">Galaxy S10e</a>.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the 2020 'e-Galaxy' <a href="https://pricebaba.com/blog/samsung-galaxy-s11e-renders-360-degree-video-exclusive/amp">may not</a> have the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Samsung-Galaxy-S11-is-expected-to-feature-a-new-108-MP-camera-sensor.441137.0.html">108MP</a> camera sensor that may be destined for its more high-end siblings. These tips may be confirmed or denied at the next <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-announces-Galaxy-Note-10-Plus-Star-Wars-special-edition-with-free-Galaxy-Buds-and-red-S-Pen.443208.0.html">Samsung</a> flagship launch event, which is now thought to take place on February 18, 2019.</p>
