      <p>The leader of the Homeland Study Group Foundation Charles Komi Kudzordzi says he is still in Ghana contrary to claims that he fled the country after declaring a part of the Volta region independent of Ghana.</p>
      <p>A manhunt is currently underway to arrest the 80-year-old man who is the main brain behind the group seeking to curve their so-called Western Togoland from Ghana</p>
      <p>In a video posted on the internet, Papavi, as he is also known said: “I am in the country anyway, I have not travelled or hidden anywhere, but I want the government to show maturity, invite me legally through my lawyers and I will present myself for the case to continue”.</p>
      <p>He also condemned the arrest of his people by government.</p>
      <p>“I want to the tell the government of Ghana that what has started happening is not the right thing; going round, arresting people in the streets, taking them and locking them up in cells and particularly taking my near 70year old wife and locking her up, no, that is not the right thing,” the 80-year-old leader of the group said in a video posted on youtube.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, five members of the group have been remanded for treason felony by a Ho district Court.</p>
      <p>This was after they were arrested following their decision to declare the Volta region independent of Ghana.</p>
      <p>Those remanded are Peter Godfriend Edem, Mkpe Tornyi Kudjo, Kofi Agbeko, Agbenyega Akudzia and Ibrahim Tofa.</p>
      <p>The suspects include the master of ceremony on the day the supposed independence was declared.</p>
      <p>Reports say one of the suspects admitted before the court that he belongs to their so-called Western Togoland.</p>
      <p>They are to reappear in court on December 4, 2019.</p>
