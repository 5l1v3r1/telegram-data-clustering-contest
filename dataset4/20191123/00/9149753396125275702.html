      <p>Not much happened this week. A <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/star-citizens-latest-free-fly-event-will-let-you-try-every-ship-in-the-game/">Star Citizen event was announced</a>, and I guess that's something. There was also that PS1-looking "Cybertruck" that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/cyberpunk-2077-might-feature-elon-musks-dumb-truck/">might appear</a> in Cyberpunk 2077. Pretty dumb. I'm struggling to think of anything else noteworthy that happened in PC gaming this week, but I'm sure I'll remember as I go.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/half-life-alyx-is-a-full-length-game-set-before-half-life-2/">
          <b>Half-Life: Alyx is a full-length game set before Half-Life 2</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Valve announced a new Half-Life game, and it's a VR-only prequel starring Alyx, and there's a trailer for it you can watch above. For more, here are <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/half-life-alyx-release-date-trailer-everything-we-know/">a bunch of things we learned about Half-Life: Alyx</a> after talking to Valve. Hopefully we find some bigger news as we go here.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/half-life-alyx-is-just-the-beginning-of-valves-return-to-the-series/">
          <b>Half-Life: Alyx is just the beginning of Valve's return to the series</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>After Half-Life: Alyx releases, Valve would "love to continue pushing forward" in the Half-Life universe according to designer David Speyrer. So maybe Half-Life 3 isn't out of the question? Interesting, but let's see if we can find some bigger PC gaming news.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/witness-the-body-horror-that-allows-rust-players-to-look-down-and-see-their-legs/">
          <b>Witness the body horror that allows Rust players to look down and see their legs</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Finally! Here's the proper PC gaming news you've been craving.</p>

        <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-releases-a-gpu-hotfix-to-address-stalling-in-red-dead-redemption-2/">
          <b>Nvidia releases a GPU hotfix to address stalling in Red Dead Redemption 2</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Red Dead Redemption 2 hasn't had the smoothest PC launch (did anyone think it would?) but Rockstar and Nvidia are steadily <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/red-dead-redemption-2-patch-aims-to-fix-crashes-and-arthurs-quick-metabolism/">improving it</a>. This particular hotfix didn't resolve all of our problems, but hopefully with a bit more ironing it'll be stabler.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-has-characters-now/">
          <b>Counter-Strike has characters now</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>They're just cosmetic additions, but it feels weird. Counter-Strike doesn't have characters, it has jerks who AWP me and then say mean things about my family.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/former-arkane-bosses-launch-a-new-studio-first-game-will-be-revealed-at-the-game-awards/">
          <b>Former Arkane bosses launch a new studio, first game will be revealed at The Game Awards</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Raphael Colantonio and Julien Roby are making games together again with a new studio called WolfEye. It sounds like they'll continue making the Dishonored-like games they're known for, and we'll see their first game at The Game Awards on December 12.</p>

      <h3>Around the office</h3>
      <p>James and Chris are fighting and there aren't any adults around to stop them. Specifically, they are fighting about arms, and whether or not Alyx should have them in Half-Life: Alyx. Right now, she just has disembodied hands. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/alyx-needs-arms/">Chris is on team arms</a>, while James is <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/keep-alyx-armless/">firmly against</a> the inclusion of arm-shaped things in VR. I don't expect this to be resolved soon.</p>
      <p>When not fighting about arms, we've been preparing for deal season, which has kicked off already with some early <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday deals</a>. If you're looking to upgrade your PC or build a new one, this weekend marks the beginning of the best time to buy parts, and we'll be sharing the best deals we find.</p>

      <p>Aside from getting into an arm-related beef, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/what-the-trailer-for-half-life-alyx-tells-us-about-city-17/">Chris analyzed the Half-Life: Alyx trailer</a> to try to figure out a few plot details, and what kind of horrible creatures we may encounterâ€”no, please, anything but the <i>sacktick</i>.</p>
      <p>Joanna has been testing Google Stadia with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/heres-how-stadias-input-lag-compares-to-native-pc-gaming/">predictable, so-so results</a>, and I've been <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/with-overwatch-2-and-path-of-exile-2-sequels-are-really-challenging-the-meaning-of-2/">musing about the nature of sequels</a> now that games are meant to be played forever.</p>
      <p>That's all for this week. I suggest everyone declare their Team Arms or Team No Arms allegiance before Monday, because Chris and James seem to be building armies now.</p>
