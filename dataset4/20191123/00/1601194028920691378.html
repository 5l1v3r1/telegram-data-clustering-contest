      <p>Tyler Duncan opened up a two-stroke lead at the halfway mark of the RSM Classic on Friday.</p>
      <p>The American carded a nine-under 61 on the Seaside course at Sea Island Golf Club in Georgia to climb to the top of the leaderboard at 14 under.</p>
      <p>Duncan holed an eagle – from 106 yards at the par-four eighth – and seven birdies during a fine second round.</p>
      <p>He sits clear of Colombian Sebastian Munoz (63), Australian Rhein Gibson (64) and American D.J. Trahan (63).</p>

      <p>Of that trio, only Trahan played the Plantation course on Friday, shooting an impressive nine-under round to get to 12 under.</p>
      <p>Ricky Barnes (63 on Plantation) and Fabian Gomez (63 on Seaside) are tied for fifth at 11 under.</p>
      <p>Webb Simpson, the overnight leader, could only manage a two-under 68 on the Seaside course to fall to a tie for 11th at nine under.</p>
      <p>Defending champion Charles Howell III missed the cut after backing up his opening-round 68 with a 72.</p>
