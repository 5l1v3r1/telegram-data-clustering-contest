      </p>
      <p>Lately I’ve been in a rampant love affair with life. It started with the recent airing of the Amazon TV series “Modern Love,” based on an essay I wrote. Episode 3 stars Anne Hathaway as me(!), navigating the rocky shoals of bipolar <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/mating">dating</a>. Anne’s performance was spot-on perfect, bringing even me to tears as she crumpled to the floor in one scene, overcome by her nemesis, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression">depression</a>. Everyone involved in the production worked hard to make the portrayal as accurate as possible.</p>
      <p>The show is a big hit. I’ve read countless messages from all over the world (the series airs in 200 countries) from people thrilled to realize they’re not alone, and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gratitude">grateful</a> for the positive, if painful, representation. I’ve received interview requests from as far away as Argentina, wanting to hear the real story behind the story. It’s been an amazing experience, to discover that so many people genuinely care to know the truth about <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/bipolar-disorder">bipolar disorder</a>.</p>
      <p>And then, a few days after the episode premiered, I received an invitation from an organization called the Hope for Depression Research Foundation. They wanted me to come to Manhattan for their annual fundraiser, and to present me with the “Ambassador of Hope” award. I’m a nervous traveler, and honored as I was to be asked, I put them off for a couple of days so I could do some research. What I learned impressed me. The Foundation was started in 2006 by Audrey Gruss, whose mother Hope suffered from clinical depression. Its mission is to discover new treatments for depression and other mental illnesses, or to prevent them from occurring. I could tell from their website, particularly their sponsors, that this was a well-funded group with considerable influence in the mental health community.</p>
      <p>The event was to be held at the recently renovated and always glorious Plaza Hotel, where I would also get to stay. When I asked about appropriate attire, I was informed that, “There will be philanthropists and socialites in the audience,” which both amused and unnerved me a bit. I argued down my usual jitters about having to travel and give a speech, and gratefully accepted the invitation.</p>
      <p>It was everything, and more, that I could have wished for. Manhattan sparkled with pre-holiday excitement, the Grand Ballroom glowed under its golden chandeliers, and the Foundation’s members turned out to be warm, wonderful people who really cared about their cause. The event sold out, raising over $800,000 in that single afternoon. Even more telling, the audience of 350 people paid close <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attention">attention</a> to the speakers, who informed them about recent developments in scientific research and treatment. There was none of the usual fidgeting, coughing, and side chatter one usually sees at charity events. These people were here to listen.</p>
      <p>When it came time for me to speak, I told the audience that ten years ago, I never would have believed that I’d be standing at a podium, at the Plaza Hotel, accepting an award for being spectacularly bipolar. They laughed, and then grew pin-drop silent as I told them the rest of my story: the years and years spent hiding my flagrant manias and soul-searing depressions; the pharmacy’s worth of pills I’d tried, the electroshock <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy">therapy</a>, the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/suicide">suicide</a> attempts—and always, like an insistent <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/dissociative-fugue-psychogenic-fugue">fugue</a>, the terror of being found out. Then the slow crawl of recovery as I began to write my story, and the gradual realization that if I wanted to live, I had to free myself from my prison of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/fear">fear</a>; followed by the publication of my bestseller “<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/mania">Manic</a>,” and all that came along with that: the deluge of attention, so much of it positive, convincing me that I had made the right decision at last by stepping out into the light.</p>
      <p>I thanked them for the award and began to walk off the stage. The silence continued, and for a heart-stopping moment I wondered if I’d said something wrong . . . But then the applause began: waves and waves of it, a standing ovation. Afterwards, dozens of people came up to me to thank me for my honesty, praise me for my courage, and just generally make me feel like the world had evolved into a place where I—and my illness—were not only accepted, but welcome.</p>
      <p>I was, in a word, euphoric. Not manic, but wrapped in a cocoon of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness">happiness</a> and hope. I remember on the trip home I didn’t even mind being jostled and scrunched in a middle seat. I was flying without the aid of the plane.</p>
      <p>Until I opened my email. There was a message from a neighbor, saying “Have you seen this?” and directing me to a message on a site called NextDoor, which is usually a place where neighbors share local info and seek recommendations for plumbers, housekeepers, that sort of thing. I’ve found it very useful in the past. But this message was far from useful. It said, in all caps:</p>
      <p>MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/resilience">RESILIENCE</a> TREATMENT CENTER IS ATTEMPTING TO OPEN A 6 BED MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY ON OAK PASS ROAD. LOOK AT THEIR WEBSITE. THIS WILL CREATE A STIGMA IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. WE ARE CONTACTING THE CITY ATTORNEY, OUR COUNCIL PERSON, AND NEIGHBORS.</p>
      <p>The writer continued, “It may bring all property values down. There is no upside to our neighborhood with such an operation. There may be <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/schizophrenia">schizophrenics</a>, bipolar persons, etc.”</p>
      <p>I was stunned. I live in a bucolic area called Benedict Canyon, a liberal bastion if ever there were one. Many artists and people in the entertainment industry have settled here, to enjoy the peace and quiet of nature only a few miles from the heart of Beverly Hills. We are fiercely protective of our tranquillity—but I never in my life expected that we harbored such <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/bias">prejudice</a>.</p>
      <p>I continued to read, disbelieving. Several other people weighed in, saying things like “No way!!!!” And “We need to stop this.” I had to close my iPad, it hurt so much to think of my beloved home polluted by such hatred and ignorance. What had happened to all that marvelous acceptance and understanding I had just bathed in? Did it only exist in the rarefied atmosphere of the Plaza, among a relatively few evolved people? Worse yet, how could I be an effective mental health advocate if I had so completely lost touch with reality?</p>
      <p>But somewhere over Idaho I started to get mad. I thought of all the people I knew who struggled with mental illness, and how hard their fight was just to survive. Why should it be any harder, just because some misguided folks had found a forum for their benighted views? Maybe reality wasn’t all golden chandeliers and good people. But it had to be better than this.</p>
      <p>So I logged onto the site and wrote: “I’m simply shocked that in this age of skyrocketing suicide rates my neighborhood would exacerbate the stigma around mental health that we are fighting so hard to eradicate. You’re all kidding, right?”</p>
      <p>The original writer quickly responded: “I would suggest, politely, that you get educated on this topic and opine with something that has a basis . . . not just an emotional outburst. Or I would also suggest that this facility be opened next to your home. Fair?”</p>
      <p>I was angry at his ad hominem attack, but even deeper than my <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger">anger</a> was a sense of lost hope, of innocence spoiled. I waited until I cooled down and got home to reply: “I have news for you, Mr. [X]. You have a bipolar neighbor . . . namely me. There goes the neighborhood, right? I just came home from winning an Ambassador of Hope award to read this post. It makes me very sad.”</p>
      <p>He wrote: “This is exactly why your opinion is not valid. Good luck.”</p>
      <p>How can anyone’s opinion not be valid, I wondered, and I wondered even more what might compel someone to be so hurtful to a total stranger. I hesitated about exposing myself to further vitriol, and thought of just ending the exchange right there. But then I caught sight of the Ambassador of Hope award sitting next to my computer, a shining crystal symbol of what was possible in the world. I swallowed my fear and responded:</p>
      <p>“Mr. [X], you and I will have to agree to civilly disagree. But as for my neighbors, I’d like to assure you that UNTREATED mental illness is the problem in our society, not treatment. Treatment is the solution. As a mental health advocate and attorney, international speaker on the topics of treatment and stigma, and author of the New York Times bestseller “Manic,” I believe I have the bona fides to express this opinion. It is based on fact, not fear.”</p>
      <p>Damn, that felt good. Scary as advocacy can be sometimes, it’s always worth it to speak out against stigma. Otherwise, how can hope gain the footing it needs to survive? I’d like to say that the original writer went silent after my message, but he didn’t. But by then it didn’t matter: my neighbors—some friends, some strangers—had begun to chime in, and his malice was drowned out by a chorus of support for my position. It was a potent reminder that enlightenment exists; only now and then it needs to be nudged into being. I went to bed if not euphoric, encouraged. Life felt worth loving again.</p>
