      <h1>On This Day in 2004 Sir Alex Ferguson Took Charge of 1,000th Match as Manchester United Manager</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15203443" target="_blank">Adam Aladay</a></address>
      <p>​Following a comfortable 2-0 win over Charlton Athletic, Manchester United hosted Lyon in what was Sir Alex Ferguson's 1,000th match in charge of the Red Devils.</p>
      <p>It was yet another milestone for the former Aberdeen boss, but he was more than aware of the importance of a win for his side in their latest Champions League tussle. </p>
      <p>Prior to kick off, chief executive David Gill came out onto the turf and presented Sir Alex with a bottle of wine, one from 1986 - the year he joined the Old Trafford side. It was a touching gesture, but it was merely a little side note in the eyes of the Scottish manager. </p>

      <p>Many had tipped the match to be open and high scoring, considering the fact that the two sides were the top scoring teams in the Champions League heading into the tussle. The pair played out an entertaining 2-2 draw in the opening group game of the competition, with Ruud van Nistelrooy scoring twice within five minutes to draw United level.</p>
      <p>Honours even on that occasion. </p>
      <p>As far as Lyon were concerned, they were hoping to spoil Sir Alex's party and steal all three points in what was, in fact, a memorable day for the French side - this being their first visit to Old Trafford. </p>

      <p>However, <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-united">​the Red Devils</a> started brightly and a young Wayne Rooney rattled the post 12 minutes in, but Gary Neville was on hand to fire home a rebound only seven minutes later. The English defender was suffering with illness and missed the tussle with Charlton only four days prior, but nonetheless, such was his commitment and desire to play, he was able to battle through and give his side the lead. </p>
      <p>Lyon grew into the contest and eventually levelled things up through Mahamadou Diarra. He picked the ball up around 30 yards out, and with limited options on, Diarra unleashed a low drive which United goalkeeper Roy Carroll was expected to collect. However, he fumbled the ball and watched as it slipped out of his grasp and dribbled in.</p>
      <p>Old Trafford fell silent and the teams went into the break level. After the interval, Fergie's men came flying out of the traps and restored their lead through Van Nistelrooy. Both teams had further opportunities as the match wore on, but United were able to see out the remainder of the game and claim a valuable three points.</p>

      <p>With another win to his name, Sir Alex had now won 564 matches of his 1,000 games in charge of Manchester United. </p>
      <p>And while few could have blamed Fergie for revelling in the moment, he was, typically, keen to discuss the performance of the team, not himself. </p>
      <p>“All day, I was a bit nervy but I kept saying to myself that it was the 999 games before it that mattered,” said Sir Alex after the match, as quoted by the <a href="https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/sir-alex-ferguson-1000-game-v-lyon-anniversary">​club's official website</a>. </p>

      <p>“It was a fantastic night and I was very pleased with my players. I am proud of them for the way they represented themselves. It was an open game and we could have scored a few more goals. Some of our football was great.“</p>
      <p>United went on to reach the round of 16 stage that season before being knocked out by AC Milan. While it may not have resulted in success that season, it was a memorable evening, with the whole team working tirelessly to produce a result <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6434487-sir-alex-ferguson-the-serial-winner-whose-trophy-haul-rewrote-football-history">​for the game's greatest ever manager</a>.</p>
      <p>What a career, and what a manager.  </p>
