      <p>Defending champions the <b>Brisbane Heat</b> secured their semi-final spot with <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/18042/game/1188423/hobart-hurricanes-women-vs-brisbane-heat-women-42nd-match-womens-big-bash-league-2019-20">a seven-run victory</a> over the <b>Hobart Hurricanes</b>. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/381268.html">Grace Harris</a> played the key innings with the bat as her 43 off 27 balls put the Heat's innings back on course after they slipped to 4 for 58 in the 10th over. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/newzealand/content/player/803971.html">Amelia Kerr</a>, who contributed an important 21 off 16, then struck vital blows with the ball to halt a promising start to the chase from the Hurricanes who had reached 0 for 52 in the powerplay. Kerr had Erin Fazackerley caught behind, with a juggle, first ball and then added Nicola Carey as Beth Mooney, who had a superb evening with the gloves, pulled off another excellent catch. Chloe Tryon threatened a late heist when she struck three boundaries in the penultimate over but Delissa Kimmince bowled with the third ball of the last as she comfortably defended 16.</p>
