      <p>The base said Friday that 47-year-old instructor pilot Lt. Col. John “Matt” Kincade and 23-year-old student pilot Lt. Travis Wilkie died in what Col Corey Simmons has called a “mishap” as two T-38 Talon jets were landing at the base in Enid, about 65 miles northwest of Oklahoma City.</p>
      <p>Two airmen aboard the second jet were not injured.</p>
      <p>Simmons said the cause of the Thursday morning accident is under investigation by an Air Force safety board that functions similarly to the National Transportation Safety Board.</p>
      <p>Simmons said it typically takes 30-60 days to determine the cause of such accidents.</p>
