      <h1>Marcus Smart: Nuggets Fan Said ‘Get on Your Knees’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slamonline.com/author/mutoni/" target="_blank">Marcel Mutoni</a></address>
      <p>Celtics guard <a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/marcus-smart">Marcus Smart</a> accused a Nuggets fan of making a racially-charged remark after he chased a loose ball into the stands during Friday night’s game at the Pepsi Center.</p>
      <p>Smart was dissatisfied with arena security’s response after he reported the verbal taunt.</p>

      <p>Denver held on for a 99-92 win against Boston, and <a href="https://apnews.com/d2695bcf8b9c4e81b50554f4815d77a0">the NBA said it is investigating</a> the incident.</p>
      <p>Per <i><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2019/11/23/marcus-smart-nuggets-fan-altercation">The Denver Post</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“My foot got stuck in a chair and a fan told me, ‘That’s right stay on the ground, get on your knees,’” Smart said after the game.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>When contacted about the incident, the Nuggets said security looked into it and couldn’t determine what happened.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“I told (security) who it was,” Smart said. “They just looked at him and didn’t even say anything to him, didn’t even get him out of the game. Probably if I was a superstar, they probably would have done something for it, but it is what it is. … We’re going to end up protecting ourselves eventually and it’s not going to be pretty for those fans and we don’t want that.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“We don’t want that as players, but at some point you’ve got to stand up and you’ve got to protect yourself as a man.”</i>
