      <h1>Predicting Chelsea's Starting XI for the Premier League Clash With Manchester City</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15224569" target="_blank">Tolga Akdeniz</a></address>
      <p>​Despite the hullabaloo around the appointment of Jose Mourinho at Spurs, the real big game of the weekend takes place on Saturday evening. Manchester City and Chelsea - the fourth and third placed teams in the league - lock horns in what should be a fascinating contest on what is guaranteed to be a mouthwatering weekend.</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard's men are flying right now, and are quietly throwing the hat in - dare I say - the Premier League title race. A win over City would certainly make many people take notice.</p>
      <p>However, how should Chelsea line up against the <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier Leagu</a><a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​e</a> champions? Should they make any changes to the side that has been steam-rolling their opponents for a number of weeks now? Well, let's take a look at their predicted starting XI for the game.</p>

      <h3>Goalkeeper &amp; Defenders</h3>

      <p><b>Kepa Arrizabalaga (GK)</b> - Kepa's form has been shaky this season, and it is evident that Lampard believes this too with rumours that he is looking to bring Shay Given in to help the Spaniard on the training ground. However, it is likely that the manager will keep faith with him for now.</p>
      <p><b>Cesar Azpilicueta (RB)</b> - Despite the good recent form of Reece James, <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/cesar-azpilicueta">​Azpilicueta</a> is Chelsea captain and has been the club's Mr. Reliable for the last few seasons, meaning he is likely to start.</p>
      <p><b>Fikayo Tomori (CB)</b> - Despite being unknown to most before the season started, Tomori has arguably become Chelsea's best centre back, and will be tasked with keeping out Manchester City's mouthwatering forwards.</p>
      <p><b>Kurt Zouma (CB) </b>- Another player who has seemingly come of age this season. Despite a slow start to the season, Zouma has been a monster at the back and will continue to partner Tomori.</p>
      <p><b>Emerson (LB)</b> - The Brazilian has suffered with injuries this season, meaning Marcos Alonso has also been in the team at times. However, when both are fit, it is clear that Emerson is first choice.</p>

      <h3>Midfielders​</h3>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Jorginho (DM)</b> - Jorginho has been a revelation this season, and is likely to start. However, due to a lack of physical ability, he has been caught out in some big games so far this campaign, so will need some more support around him.</p>
      <p><b>N'Golo Kante (CM)</b> - Chelsea's best player and is simply a lock to start. He can be the man to offer Jorginho some defensive support.</p>
      <p><b>Mateo Kovacic (CM)</b> - Like Jorginho, he has stepped up massively under Lampard. His ability to drive through midfield will be a huge asset in a game like this.</p>

      <p><b>Willian (RW)</b> - A senior player in this Chelsea team, <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/willian">​Willian</a> has been superb this season. One of Lampard's key men, the Brazilian will be crucial in starting counter-attacks and running at the City defence.</p>
      <p><b>Tammy Abraham (ST)</b> - Alongside Jamie Vardy, Abraham has been the most in-form striker in the Premier League this season. This one's a no-brainer.</p>
      <p><b>Christian Pulisic (RW)</b> - After being eased into the <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/chelsea">​Chelsea</a> set-up, Pulisic has burst into life with a number of sensational performances, including a hat-trick against Burnley. There were questions over his fitness before the game, but Lampard confirmed that he will indeed be ready.</p>
