      <h1>Real Madrid 3-1 Real Sociedad: Report, Ratings &amp; Reaction as Los Blancos Win Amid Bale Boos</h1>

      <p>Real Madrid overcame a bright Real Sociedad 3-1 at the ​Santiago Bernabeu in La Liga on Saturday evening, with Gareth Bale coming on to a chorus of boos in the second half. </p>
      <p>The hosts made the worst possible start when Sergio Ramos played a woeful back pass which Willian Jose intercepted, before rounding Thibaut Courtois and tapping home to give his side the lead after just two minutes. </p>

      <p>Los Blancos grew into the contest and Karim Benzema drew them level on 37 minutes, bundling the ball in following a cross from Luka Modric. After the break, it took Zinedine Zidane's men just two minutes to move into the lead, as Fede Valverde's deflected shot from outside the area flew in. </p>
      <p>The home side extended their lead on 74 minutes as Modric powered home a left-footed strike, following a cross by Bale. Zidane's men continued to push forward and could have added to their advantage, but were unable to do so. Nonetheless, it a was a promising showing and a valuable three points.</p>

      <h3>REAL MADRID</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Key Talking Point</b>
      </p>
      <p>Zinedine Zidane's Real Madrid have begun to show some consistency in recent weeks, having won four of their previous five matches in all competitions. In these five matches, Los Blancos netted 16 times and didn't concede a single goal. </p>
      <p>However, they made the worst possible start against La Real, conceding within two minutes. Ramos turned and played a blind pass, allowing Willian Jose to steal the ball and tap home. The away side went on to dominate possession and looked the more likely to score the game's second goal. </p>

      <p>The home side began to warm to the task and, following a number of chances, they drew level through the chest/shoulder of Benzema. From that moment on, Los Blancos dominated proceedings, playing neat one-touch passes around the away defence before testing the goalkeeper. </p>
      <p>They continued to grow in confidence and once they had added a second, the result never really looked in doubt. It was another step in the right direction as far as Zidane is concerned.</p>

      <p>On a side note, Gareth Bale came on to a chorus of boos in the second half, replacing Rodrygo. There was a loud applause for the teenager as he came off, but the boos rang loud and clear throughout the stadium as Bale took to the field. He received a similar reception with each touch he took, despite his attempts to make things happen for the team.</p>
      <p>The Welshman made an immediate impact when his right-footed cross found Benzema, who nodded it down for Modric to strike. Ultimately, he was excellent in everything he did, but only a small minority of the crowd warmed to him as the match wore on. </p>

      <p><b>Starting XI: </b>Courtois (6); Carvajal (6), Varane (6), Ramos (4), Mendy (7); Valverde (8), Casemiro (6), Modric (7); Rodrygo (5), Hazard (6), Benzema (9*)</p>

      <hr/>
      <p><b>STAR PLAYER - </b>Both Valverde and Ferland Mendy were impressive, constantly looking to make things happen throughout the evening. However, once again, it was Karim Benzema who was Real Madrid's standout performer. </p>
      <p>Of course, he drew the home side level towards the end of the first half, but his overall performance was sensational. Perhaps one of the more underrated strikers around, he is unselfish and works tirelessly to create opportunities for his teammates.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old was at the heart of every promising attack and it was his cross that eventually fell to Valverde, with his deflected strike putting Los Blancos into the lead. He then nodded the ball down for Modric to make it 3-1. An excellent performance by the striker.</p>
