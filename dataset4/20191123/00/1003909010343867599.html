      <h1>Officials break ground on new Centre for Child and Adolescent Mental Health</h1>

      <p>Alberta Health Services and the Alberta Children’s Hospital Foundation marked the start of construction Friday on a new Calgary facility that will be dedicated to mental health treatment for youth.</p>
      <p>The Centre for Child and Adolescent Mental Health, in the northwest community of Hounsfield Heights, is scheduled to open in the fall of 2021.</p>
      <p>A fundraising campaign launched by the Alberta Children’s Hospital Foundation last year raised $47.2 million as of a ceremonial groundbreaking at the site Friday morning. By the end of the event, a donor contributed the final amount needed to reach the foundation’s $50-million goal.</p>
      <p>Saifa Koonar, president and CEO of the Alberta Children’s Hospital Foundation, said the centre “will change the landscape of how we are able to care for kids and their families that are suffering from mental health issues.”</p>
      <p>David Weyant, chair of the Alberta Health Services board, described the purpose-built site as a new model that will provide a combination of services.</p>
      <p>The facility will include a walk-in clinic on the main level, which will provide urgent mental health and addiction services, and intensive treatment services on the second floor to help young people in crisis and prevent the need for hospitalization. On the third floor, there will be a day hospital to support patients transitioning from hospital.</p>
      <p>Jason Luan, Alberta’s associate minister of mental health and addictions, said the fact that donors have stepped up so quickly to support the centre “speaks volumes to how much mental health means to all of us.”</p>
      <p>Premier Jason Kenney also commended the amount raised, “even in tough times” in the province.</p>
      <p>“I cannot think of a better expression of the Alberta spirit of community than the generosity on display here today,” he said.</p>

      <p>Officials say young people and their families have been advisers on the initiative. One of the members of the centre’s youth advisory council, Naomi Pearce, 18, shared her experience of getting help at 16 years of age for mental health issues, including depression and anxiety.</p>
      <p>“The world can be a very dark and lonely place when you isolate yourself, and at 16 years old, my world was pitch black,” Pearce told the crowd gathered for the groundbreaking.</p>
      <p>She said for years she had been under the impression that her thoughts and feelings were her problem, and that she was “broken in some way.”</p>
      <p>After getting care in hospital, where she was admitted for two months, Pearce said “light began to filter back” into her world. She is now in her first year of studies at Red Deer College and plans to pursue a career in medicine.</p>
      <p>“So much of that darkness I went through could have been avoided,” Pearce said. “My hope for the new centre is that kids who are struggling will understand that they have somewhere safe to go before things get critical.”</p>
      <p>University of Calgary chancellor Deborah Yedlin said the centre will be “one of the most robust research-intensive, community-based mental-health care facilities for young people in the country.”</p>

      <p>“We will be able to conduct research that’s never been possible before in our community,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We know that child-health research is life-trajectory research. Finding ways to improve a young person’s health improves their health in the long-term.”</p>
      <p>Research initiatives will involve various faculties at the University of Calgary and will be led by experts from the Owerko Centre at the Alberta Children’s Hospital Research Institute and the Mathison Centre at the Hotchkiss Brain Institute.</p>
      <p>Officials say the site has been designed to create a warm and inviting atmosphere unlike other clinical options available in the city. A family advisory council and youth advisory council provided input on both the design of the building and the centre’s programs and services.</p>
