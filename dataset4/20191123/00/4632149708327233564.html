      <h1>Trump wants Senate trial for ‘fairness’</h1>

      <p><b><i>US president says Joe Biden should be among the witnesses to be questioned during probe<br/></i></b><br/>US President Donald Trump wants an impeachment trial to go forward in the Senate because he would receive due process there and he expects Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden would be among the witnesses, a White House spokesman said on Thursday. <br/><br/>"President Trump wants to have a trial in the Senate because it's clearly the only chamber where he can expect fairness and receive due process under the Constitution," spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement. "We would expect to finally hear from witnesses who actually witnessed, and possibly participated in corruption - like Adam Schiff, Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and the so-called Whistleblower, to name a few," Gidley said, referring to Intelligence Committee Chairman Schiff, who is leading an impeachment inquiry into Trump. <br/><br/><b>Mountain of evidence is beyond dispute <br/></b><br/>After two weeks of riveting public hearings in the US House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, there is a mountain of evidence that is now beyond dispute. <br/><br/><br/>Trump explicitly ordered US government officials to work with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani on matters related to Ukraine, a country deeply dependent on Washington's help to fend off Russian aggression. The Republican president pushed Ukraine to launch investigations into political rivals, leaning on a discredited conspiracy theory his own advisers disputed. And both American and Ukrainian officials feared that Trump froze a much-needed package of military aid until Kyiv announced it was launching those probes. <br/><br/>Those facts were confirmed by a dozen witnesses, mostly staid career government officials who served both Democratic and Republican administrations. They relied on emails, text messages and contemporaneous notes to back up their recollections from the past year. <br/><br/><br/>Stitched together, their hours of televised testimony paint a portrait of an American president willing to leverage his powerful office to push a foreign government for personal political help. That alone has many Democrats on the brink of voting to impeach Trump before the end of the year, potentially pushing toward a trial in the Senate.</p>
