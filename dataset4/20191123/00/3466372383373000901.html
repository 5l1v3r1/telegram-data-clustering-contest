      <p>After <a href="https://www.rediff.com/news/report/fadnavis-takes-oath-as-maha-cm-ajit-pawar-his-deputy/20191123.htm">Ajit Pawar joined hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party</a> to form a government in Maharashtra, NCP chief Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule on Saturday confirmed that the party has split.</p>

      <p>Sule put up a story on Whatsapp which states that "party and family split". Her office has also confirmed the same.</p>
      <p>In another Whatsapp update, she added, "Who do you trust in life. Never felt so cheated in life. Defended him, loved him. Look what I get in return."</p>
      <p>When the media caught up with her, she declined to speak, saying, "I will speak after the official joint press conference of the three parties."</p>
      <p>Early on Saturday, BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis took oath as chief minister of Maharashtra for the second consecutive term after a month-long uncertainty over government formation in the state. Sharad Pawar's nephew Ajit Pawar has reportedly back-stabbed his uncle by joining hands with the BJP and took oath as deputy chief minister of the state.</p>
      <p>The development can only be termed as a big jolt to the efforts taken by Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP to forge an alliance to form government in Maharashtra.</p>
