        <b>Borussia Dortmund's captain Marco Reus scored a late leveller at home to Paderborn but blasted their display in Friday's Bundesliga game.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Marco Reus said he was "ashamed" of Borussia Dortmund's performance </b>in a 3-3 Bundesliga draw at home to Paderborn despite his late equaliser salvaging a point.</p>
      <p>Dortmund, beaten <b>4-0 away to Bayern Munich</b> in their last match before the international break, were <b>3-0 down at half-time</b> in Friday's clash against the league's bottom side.</p>
      <p><b>Streli Mamba struck twice and Gerrit Holtmann was also on target</b> for Steffen Baumgart's side, while Dortmund lost striker Paco Alcacer to injury before the interval.</p>
      <p>Dortmund improved after the break, with <b>Jadon Sancho reducing the deficit two minutes after the restart, and Axel Witsel gave the hosts further hope</b> by scoring with six minutes to go.</p>
      <p>Sancho then crossed for <b>Reus </b>to nod home the leveller in the second minute of added time to spare Dortmund an embarrassing defeat, though the captain was unimpressed with his side.</p>
      <p>"We can never play like that again," he told DAZN after Dortmund missed the chance to move up to second place in the table. </p>

      <p>Pressure has been growing on Lucien Favre, whose side came from two goals down to beat Inter in the Champions League this month, but Reus defended the under-fire Dortmund coach.</p>
      <p>"<b>The coach puts us in a great position every time</b>. We're responsible for putting our performance on the pitch, and we do not have to talk about the coach, but about us," the forward said. </p>
      <p>"<b>If 80,000 people come here on a Friday night, we cannot offer that</b>."</p>
      <p>Dortmund will be eight points off the top of the table if Borussia Monchengladbach win at Union Berlin on Saturday.</p>
