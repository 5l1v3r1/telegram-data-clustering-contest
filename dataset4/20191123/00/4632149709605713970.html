      <h1>Will he, won’t he? Everybody — including Pawar and Aaditya — wants Uddhav as next Maha CM</h1>

      <p>Doubt anybody at Matoshree slept on Friday night, especially on the 3rd floor, where Uddhav and Rashmi and Aaditya have their rooms. <br/><br/>The ground-plus-three mansion in Bandra-east, every Shiv Sainik’s pilgrimage and the party’s undisputed seat of power, stands at a cross-road. Will a Thackeray – in this case Uddhav – take up a position in the government, giving up the remote control the family has wielded so effectively for decades, opening itself to public scrutiny? <br/><br/>Everybody – from Sharad Pawar to Aaditya to top Congress leaders – think he should. But as night fell on Friday, there was no clear indication whether he will. <br/><br/>All we had was a statement from Sena spokesman Sanjay Raut, claiming Uddhav had, ‘in principal’, agreed to take the plunge. <br/><br/>Implications are staggering. A Thackeray at the head of coalition government formed with the help of the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party itself takes some wrapping one’s head around. A Thackeray occupying Varsha – Maharashtra chief minister’s official residence – is a tectonic power shift of political heft from the suburbs to the town. And then, of course, there is the symbolism of Uddhav eventually entering Mantralaya, thumbing his nose at Devendra Fadnavis and his BJP – stuff modern Chanakyas’ dreams are made of. <br/><br/>Matoshree has already made some significant departures from traditions – Aaditya is the first Thackeray to contest an election and he is an MLA now. The Thackerays have begun to step out of Matoshree to hold discussions with potential partners. And then there was the breaking up with the BJP – an alliance that was crafted by Bal Thackeray and which stood the test of time for close to 30 years. <br/><br/>But the decision Uddhav decided to sleep over on Friday night is the biggest yet. Things moved at dizzying pace on Friday. At a meeting of top Congress-NCP-Sena leaders at Nehru Centre, Uddhav’s name was the unanimous choice for the chief minister’s post. While Sena MLAs want Uddhav to accept chief ministership as it would end all jockeying for the coveted post in the party, the Congress-NCP believe Uddhav as CM will lend solidity to the alliance and gravitas to the government. <br/><br/>Sources said his wife Rashmi – who many believe holds the veto in the family on all matters political or otherwise – is also of the view that its time he took the plunge. Only Uddhav himself is not entirely convinced yet and a decision is likely to be taken after further consultations with family members and senior Sena leaders. <br/><br/>A senior Sena functionary said the major concern is that it is going to be coalition government. “See we don’t have enough numbers. It would have been easy for Uddhavji to be CM if we had a majority on our own. At the same time, unless Uddhavji becomes CM, the government won’t have enough weight. We don’t have a choice too, since the other contenders are not seen as CM material,” he said. <br/><br/><br/>Uddhav, 59, was always a reluctant politician. He entered politics in 1995 when he helped design the party’s campaign for assembly elections. Sena, in partnership with the BJP, won the election and formed the government. <br/><br/>However, twin tragedies struck the family soon after. Bal Thackeray lost his elder son Bindumadhav and wife Meenatai within two years of the Sena assuming power and he began relying more and more on Uddhav for support and advice. During this trying period, Uddhav’s high-profile cousin Raj Thackeray got entangled in the infamous Ramesh Kini murder case and had to lie low for almost two years. This gave space to Uddhav to tighten his grip on the party organisation. <br/><br/><br/>he 2002 BMC elections were fought and won under Uddhav’s leadership. This was his first major foray into active politics. In 2003, he was appointed the party’s working president and hasn’t looked back since.And as the world readies to enter a new year, Uddhav will have to take the next big step of his political life, one which will define him and his party for many years to come. Will he, won’t he?</p>
