      <h1>Sheffield Utd vs Man Utd: 6 Key Facts and Stats to Impress Your Mates Ahead of Premier League Clash</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/sheff-utd">​Sheffield United</a> have had a fortnight or so to sit back and appreciate their incredibly impressive start to the season, as they occupy fifth position in the <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier League</a> heading into week 13.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a point behind in seventh place, <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-united">​Manchester United</a> haven't quite enjoyed the international break to the same extent as they ponder, embarrassed, as to how they can make up an eight-point deficit to the top four.</p>
