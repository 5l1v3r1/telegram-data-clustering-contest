      <p>Head coach of Inter Milan, Antonio Conte, has taught his players how to have sex with their partners in order to stay at their best form on the field of play during the season.</p>
      <p>The former Italy and Chelsea boss told his players that while having sex in the course of the season, they must not last long and also ensure that they stay under their partners.</p>
      <p>Speaking to L'Equipe in a recent interview, the 50-year-old Italian said, “During the season, I advise my players to have sex for short periods and with the minimum of effort, and better use positions where they are under their partners.</p>
      <p>“And preferably, with their wives, because if with others, well, that needs extra action.”</p>
