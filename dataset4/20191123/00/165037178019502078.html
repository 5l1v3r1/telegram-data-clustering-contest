        <b>Leicester are unstoppable this season, as they went another step in the right direction of doing important things this year. After a very equal first half, Ayoze and Vardy got the scoring underway and secured another three points against Brighton.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's not that they have the right to dream, it's that<b> they're obliged to do so</b>. Brendan Rodger's team secured their <b>ninth win of the season in 13 games </b>to put them firmly in contention for the Champions League places and also following Liverpool, as they are now second in the table.</p>
      <p>The attacking block built this season <b>works a treat</b>. But Vardy's talent to always excel has also rubbed off on Ayoze. <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/leicester-city-fc/">Leicester</a> waited a while to see goal, but when they did,<b> it was an important goal for them,</b> to keep their dreams alive.</p>
      <p>It's quite easy to summarise what happened at the The American Express Community Stadium. Because <b>Vardy made the play on the left </b>and the former Newcastle player was<b> the one who scored.</b></p>

      <p>This happened in the 64th minute, and it was from this point that Brighton's luck runs out, as it always does with teams who face Leicester when they go ahead first.</p>
      <p>Fortune finished off the game. Because<b> Gray gave a penalty away for a foul on </b>Vardy. And although Maddison scored with the deflection, the referee wanted it to be played again. And of course, Vardy did not miss two penalties in a row...</p>
      <p>With 0-2 and only seven minutes to play, there was nothing Brighton could do, they went away with their second consecutive defeat, but still maintain <b>a cushion of five points on the relegation places.</b></p>
