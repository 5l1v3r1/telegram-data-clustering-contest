        <b>Reigning Formula E champion Jean-Eric Vergne will start the second race in Diriyah from last after receiving a grid drop for a change of his DS Techeetah car's battery.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Vergne clouted the wall heavily in Saturday's free practice session at Turn 17, but managed to return to the pits with left-rear suspension damage.</p>
      <p>Although the DS mechanics repaired the car, a battery safety check with FIA-supplier McLaren Applied Technologies forced a swap to a new unit before qualifying.</p>
      <p>This was considered a breach of Article 28.5 of FE's sporting regulations, and Vergne was therefore given a 20-place grid penalty.</p>
      <p>Article 28.4 states that only one battery pack is permitted each season per car, while Article 28.5 defines the penalty for exceeding that.</p>
      <p>DS Techeetah boss Mark Preston said Vergne went "above the g [-force] limit" during his crash, "which also meant he had to have the doctor come down and see if he's OK".</p>
      <p>"The same g-limit applies to the battery - it has a max as well," Preston continued to Autosport.</p>
      <p>"And then you're supposed to get it checked [by MAT] after it hits that g-limit - so they took the battery away, but I understand its actually got some damage to it from the accident.</p>

      <p>"I don't know exactly what it is, but that means it's not force majeure, [as] we actually had a crash. So therefore you get a battery [change] penalty - it's simple as that in the end.</p>
      <p>"We thought they would just check it and re-do the whatevers inside the little device that is a safety valve almost, and then they'd say, 'OK, next race [in Santiago] you switch the battery back'.</p>
      <p>"But because it's damaged that's different."</p>
      <p>Vergne originally qualified 11th, without experience of how the track had evolved on Saturday because he managed very little running as a result of his practice crash.</p>
      <p>As Vergne cannot take the full 20-place drop, he will receive a 10-second in-race penalty as a result.</p>
      <p>Vergne's penalty lifts Dragon's Nico Muller off of the back row of the grid, while Nyck de Vries is elevated from last place.</p>
      <p>Jaguar's Mitch Evans has also lost his superpole time, having been found to be under the minimum weight of 900kg after the final part of qualifying.</p>
      <p>Evans's 1m11.929s lap, set to carry him to fourth on the grid, was deleted after the breach of Article 5.1 of the technical regulations. The New Zealander will start sixth as a result.</p>
      <p>Mahindra's Jerome d'Ambrosio and Vergne's team-mate Antonio Felix da Costa move up a position each.</p>
