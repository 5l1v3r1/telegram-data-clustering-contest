      <p>This week, <i>Borderlands 3</i> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/22/borderlands-3s-maliwan-takedown-is-fun-mayhem-4-and-matchmaking-are-not/#465f7a3851f8">introduced the Mayhem 4 difficulty level</a> which rockets enemy health and shields to 850-1000 of their base values, a wild increase from Mayhem 3’s 150-200% increases. I have found this to be pretty unbearable when playing most content in <i>Borderlands 3</i> right now, with the exception of certain boss farms that you can build for in order to still burn them down relatively quickly.I managed to come up with a build that takes down Mayhem 4 Gigamind in roughly 15-30 seconds, depend on how things go, my old favorite farming punching bag, and once I got that down, I decided to do 50 full runs to see what this new 700% loot increase drop rate would look like, plus new factors like potentially new Mayhem 4 legendaries or new Anointments.</p>
      <p>To do this, I used the Amara build that I <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/13/heres-a-crazy-high-damage-borderlands-3-amara-build-for-mayhem-3/">wrote about a week or so ago</a>. To kill Gigamind, I used a pair of Crossroads SMGs, one electric for his shield, one flesh for his health bar, to take him down, though later I switched to an Anointed electric Cutsman that I actually found during the course of this farming run.</p>
      <p>So, what are the end results? I made a large Excel spreadsheet for this, but the highlights are:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Total Legendary Drops: 95</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Guns: 49</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Shields: 9</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Class Mods: 10</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Artifacts: 14</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Grenades: 11</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Skins: 2</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Anointed Drops: 11</b>
      </p>
      <p>So, to sum up, I averaged about 2 legendary drops per Gigamind kill. The highest was 4 in one run, and I got zero drops maybe four times out of 50 runs. That is definitely noticeably better than post-nerf Mayhem 3. Anointed drops were about 20%, which could be a touch higher than normal, but I’m not positive.</p>

      <p>One new issue is that bosses now have specific loot pools, so it’s possible that you may be farming for a gun that literally can’t drop from a boss now, though we don’t have full lists of those yet. While I did see some repeated guns (I got three Anointed Cutsmans alone in this test), there was a really wide range of stuff, so the pool does not seem super small.</p>
      <p>I did <i>not</i> see a single new Mayhem 4-only item drop here, from what I can tell. I don’t know if I was just unlucky, if they can’t drop from Gigamind, or if they only drop in the Takedown or something. I did get some of the new Anointments though, like doing 50% more weapon damage to enemies under 25% health, or getting 30% lifesteal after Attack Command (for FL4K).</p>
      <p>If you can come up with a DPS build that makes these runs not that difficult, I would probably recommend Mayhem 4 farming for the higher drop rate if you’re able. The rate is noticeably higher, and the runs can still take not that long. These 50 runs were maybe 1.5-2 hours total. The runs themselves are only 20-30 seconds, but factoring in loading, inventory management and occasionally buying ammo (Crossroads burns through it), that adds extra time.</p>
      <p>I still think that Mayhem 4 goes too far in terms of enemy health boosts, which seems like a lame way to increased difficulty just by making everything a bullet sponge. Bosses are weird in <i>Borderlands</i> in that some of them feel like they have less overall health than some random badass enemies, and Gigamind is one of them. I hear Graveward is an absolute pain now with 1000% more health, and I don’t think my old Lyuda farming strategy can work on him anymore as I simply wouldn’t have enough ammo.</p>
      <p>Anyway, Mayhem 4 does have the loot, but farming it seems very situational at the moment. Do what you will.</p>
