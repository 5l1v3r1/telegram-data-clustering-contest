      <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 23: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday the United States will hold members of the Iranian regime accountable for their violent repression of the Iranian people. <br/><br/>"The US is sanctioning the Minister of Information and Communications Technology, Mohammad Jahromi, for helping shut down the Iranian internet," Pompeo tweeted on Friday. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said: "Iranâ€™s leaders know that a free and open internet exposes their illegitimacy, so they seek to censor internet access to quell anti-regime protests."</p>
