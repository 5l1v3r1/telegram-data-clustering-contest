      <p>The Government has no option but to implement the Karnataka Open Spaces (Prevention of Disfigurement) Act across Karnataka. The scope of the ongoing public interest litigation that sought to prevent illegal flex banners and posters among other outdoor advertising from Bengaluru has been extended across the State with the High Court on Friday ordering that a notification implementing the Act should be issued forthwith. <br/><br/>Under Section 3 of the Act any citizen can complain about disfigurement of public places and the police are bound to take action as per the Act. The HC has reiterated this in Fridayâ€™s order. The HC has also directed for removing the structures on which illegal banners and hoardings were put up. This can be done under the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act. <br/><br/><br/>The authorities were directed to conduct a survey of all the illegal hoardings, their structures and other disfigurements and submit it to the court by the next date of hearing. The case has been adjourned to December 13. <br/><br/>An application was filed in the PIL pointing out to erecting of illegal hoardings and posters with the emblem of the State on July 6 commiserating the anniversary of Babu Jagajivan Ram. The illegal hoardings came up on the gates of Vidhana Soudha. The court directed filing of a FIR in this issue. <br/><br/><br/>The latest HC order mandates the Government to issue all Municipalities and Corporations in the State to implement the Act.</p>
