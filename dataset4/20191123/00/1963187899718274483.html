      <p>CAIRO – 23 November 2019: Minister of Investment and International Cooperation Sahar Nasr stressed that Egypt possesses a robust infrastructure through which it can fulfill the needs of investors and that is the reason it has become the most attractive to investments on the continent. <br/><br/>The minister added that Egypt is experiencing radical changes that put it on top of investment attractions in all sectors. <br/><br/>Nasr also pointed out to the legislative reforms undertaken to improve the investment environment, and facilitate administrative processes. The minister highlighted offering industrial lands having all utilities needed, making room for private investors in promising sectors, whether independently or in partnership with the government, and providing incentives for the private sector to take part in mega projects. <br/><br/>In parallel, a national plan for radical economic reforms has been accomplished with the support of international financial institutions, the minister said. Nasr explained that out of faith in the role of the private sector in the development process, the government has collaborated with development partners, banks, and development funds to secure soft loans for SMEs. <br/><br/>Africa 2019 is held on November 22-23 in Egypt’s New Administrative Capital and is attendee by African heads of states, ministers, and 2,000 investors and development partners.</p>
