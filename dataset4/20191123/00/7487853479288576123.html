      <h1>Sir Alex Ferguson Compares Man Utd's Current Crop of Youngsters to Class of '92</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15111589" target="_blank">Ed Alexander</a></address>
      <p>​Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has claimed the youngsters currently filling the Red Devils side remind him of those from the Class of '92.</p>
      <p>It took the Scot four years to win his first piece of silverware at Old Trafford, with the emergence of players like Ryan Giggs and David Beckham then helping the club take a stranglehold on English football. Paul Scholes, the Neville brothers and Nicky Butt also joined the pair in fuelling United's march to the top of the sport.</p>

      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has demonstrated his willingness to give youth a chance since taking charge of the side last winter. Among the list of academy graduates to find favour under the Norwegian are Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood, Scott McTominay and Brandon Williams. </p>
      <p>Discussing how the quartet and their counterparts have progressed following Solskjaer's appointment, Ferguson told <a href="http://talksport.com/football/633202/sir-alex-ferguson-jose-mourinho-tottenham-academy/">​talkSPORT</a>: "They’re all doing well. It’s a good set up at <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-united">​United</a>. For any young kid going there, it’s a great club to go to.</p>
      <p>"If we go back to the young lads of ‘92, you give them an opportunity to play for Man United in front of 75,000 people, and they don’t want to miss that. They all did very well, and they’re also very good human beings.</p>
      <p>"The thing about young people is, if you give them an opportunity, not only do they seize it, they never let you down. They have enthusiasm to do well."</p>

      <p>"And I think England are producing great young players who are representing their country and that can only be a good thing. Hopefully Scotland can follow that!"</p>
      <p>Rashford has scored in each of the Three Lions' last three matches, Gareth Southgate's men securing their safe passage to the European Championship finals next summer. </p>
      <p>However, McTominay and his fellow Scots must overcome Israel in a playoff, before meeting either Norway or Serbia in a final showdown.</p>
