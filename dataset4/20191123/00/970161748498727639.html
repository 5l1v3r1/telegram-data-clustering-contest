        <b>Michael J Pollard, best known for his role in Bonnie and Clyde has passed away at the age of 80.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Michael shot to fame as an actor in 1967 and as well as Bonnie and Clyde he had featuring roles in Lost In Space and Star Trek.</p>
      <p>The star reportedly died on Wednesday of a cardiac arrest at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, his friend Dawn Walker told The Hollywood Reporter.</p>
      <p>‘He was quite a character without knowing it,’ Alison Martino, who first reported Pollard’s death, wrote on her Vintage Los Angeles Facebook page.</p>
      <p>‘He walked everywhere and never repeated his stories because he had so many. The only thing he repeated was his love for Turner Classic Movies. And you could never call him after 7:30 because he’d be watching Jeopardy.’</p>
      <p>Tributes have been pouring in online from fans and former colleagues.</p>

      <p>Director Rob Zombie took to Facebook to pay his tribute.</p>
      <p>He began: ‘We have lost another member of our HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES family. I woke up to the news that Michael J. Pollard had died. I have always loved his work and his truly unique on screen presence. He was one of the first actors I knew I had to work with as soon as I got my first film off the ground. He will be missed.</p>
      <p>‘I can’t believe all three of my friends in this picture are now gone.’</p>
