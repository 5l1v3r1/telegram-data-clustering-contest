      <h1>Here’s how keto dieters are avoiding the carb-filled hell of Thanksgiving</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:17:28+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 00:17</time> by <a rel="author">Suzy Weiss and Princess Jones</a></address>
      <p>It’s not just politics dividing dinner tables this Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>Carbs are the new taboo thanks to the <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/10/10/can-you-really-lose-weight-eating-gobs-of-butter-on-the-keto-diet/">insanely popular and uber-strict keto eating plan</a>. And though the high-fat, low-carb diet allows for plenty of turkey, it’s the beloved sides that have the dieters plotting their strategy against judgmental family members and waistline-threatening treats.</p>
      <p>Keto, which has become a favorite diet of A-listers like Halle Berry and Kourtney Kardashian, works by forcing the body into ketosis, a metabolic state in which energy is sourced from fat instead of carbs, its proponents say. But for it to work, followers have to stay away from carbs and sugar — including most fruits and even some vegetables — which means Thanksgiving staples such as mashed potatoes, stuffing, and sugary desserts are off-limits.</p>
      <p>That’s going to be a challenge for keto dieters such as Daniela Gonzalez, a Chicago-based photographer, who started following the eating plan last January, along with her husband.</p>
      <p>“I was into mashed potatoes and gravy,” Gonzalez, 36, says of her past carb-filled life. “And cranberry sauce, which is loaded with sugar. I was a big dessert lover.”</p>
      <p>But Gonzalez has lost 46 pounds, going from 176 to 130, so she doesn’t plan on indulging in “no-no” foods over the holidays.</p>
      <p>“Cheating would defeat my victory,” the 5-foot-2-inch mom of four says.</p>
      <p>Appeasing judgmental relatives is a constant struggle for those on the controversial diet — which many doctors and dietitians say <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/10/10/can-you-really-lose-weight-eating-gobs-of-butter-on-the-keto-diet/">isn’t sustainable for the average person</a> and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/29/americans-waste-this-much-money-a-year-on-do-nothing-fad-diets/">critics call a fad</a>.</p>
      <p>“People tell me that I’m going to become anorexic or have high cholesterol,” she says. “I have friends whose families say, ‘Don’t bring that keto stuff here.’ ”</p>
      <p>Still, she says the haters are floored when they see her progress in person. “They’re the same people who are asking me on the side, like, “How’d you do it?’ ”</p>
      <p>She and other followers of the diet say their strategy to avoid hurt feelings over a rebuffed pecan pie is to just bring their own food — partially so that they can get enough to eat, but mostly to prove that the diet isn’t just butter and bacon, Gonzalez says.</p>
      <p>“I’m taking a lot so they can see all the options there are. Especially for my father-in-law. Father-in-laws always have something to say.”</p>
      <p>When Gonzalez shows up to her in-laws’ house for Thanksgiving next week, she’ll be armed with a keto stuffing — she uses a recipe in which the bread is replaced with a keto corn bread — a Puerto Rican lechón, a keto cheesecake, keto pumpkin pie and a zucchini noodle shrimp dish.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, her mother-in-law will make more traditional dishes: “It’s kind of like a face-off,” she says with a laugh.</p>
      <p>For the most part, the diet’s trademark emphasis on butter may actually win over reluctant family members, says Lisa MarcAurele, 49, a Connecticut-based diet coach with 345,000 Instagram followers.</p>
      <p>“My son actually liked the mock mashed potatoes better than the regular ones because it had cream cheese, heavy cream, which is real, high fat, and butter,” MarcAurele says.</p>
      <p>Andra Barrow, who’s been on the diet for about a year, says for all the trouble of planning separate dishes, it’ll be worth it when those who stick to the diet see the family photos later.</p>
      <p>“Last year, we were the only people we knew who weighed less after the holidays than before,” says Barrow, 47, a stagehand from the Hudson Valley. “We’re looking forward to making it two-for-two.”</p>
