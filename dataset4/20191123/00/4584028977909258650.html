      <p>Kingston College coach, Ludlow Bernard, dropped a bombshell immediately after helping his team become the first to hold the ISSA Champions Cup inside the National Stadium on Saturday, announcing his wish to go on a sabbatical from coaching.</p>
      <p>Kingston College got the better of the highly fancied Clarendon College after a 63<sup>rd</sup>-minute wonder strike from Renaldo Robinson but it was a tactical masterpiece from Bernard that really caught the eye.</p>
      <p>The KC coach, who brought them their first Manning Cup title in 32 years, as well as the Champions Cup in 2017, matched his opposite number in Lenny Hyde over and over throughout the game.</p>
      <p>After it, Bernard did an interview on SportsMax, pointing out how proud he was of his team for their performance in what is likely a farewell match.</p>
      <p>“This is indeed a gift for the school. I don’t know if I should say parting gift,” said Bernard.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Bernard had said the boys were to be lauded for the part they played in bringing the title to KC because Clarendon College are an awesome team.</p>
      <p>“Any game against Lenny Hyde is always going to be a challenge because he’s a good coach with a good team. But I think this evening we really planned a masterpiece. Even when we made a couple of changes to the team and persons were wondering but it was all deliberate,” said Bernard before thanking his entire support team for the job they did in producing a good season.</p>
      <p>“We knew we wouldn’t have as much possession as we’d like but we just wanted to pick them off where possible and counter because counterattacking is the strength of this team this year. I really lift my hat off to these boys for a wonderful season. We have played an entire season and we have not lost a game in 90 minutes,” he said.</p>
      <p>Bernard continued to be cryptic about what the future holds for him as a coach, saying that though he intends to call it a day at KC, the boys may inveigle him to stay.</p>
      <p>“Ludlow Bernard is going to take a sabbatical and we are going to have to sit and discuss with family and everybody because I’ve really spent quite a bit of time here at Kingston College and it is a joy working with these players.</p>
      <p>“I know I said it to the players last night and they said coach ‘you can’t go, you can’t leave us.’ They kinda have me soft so you may very well see me.”</p>
