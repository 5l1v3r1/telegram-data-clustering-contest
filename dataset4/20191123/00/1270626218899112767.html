      <p>Cuban slugger Luis “King Kong” Ortiz says he believes he is the best and that is why he is getting his rematch with Deontay "The Bronze Bomber" Wilder tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Wilder and Ortiz will collide for a second time at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.</p>
      <p>Ortiz challenged Wilder back in March last year at Barclays Centre in Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>Ortiz was dropped early on, but he came back in the seventh round to badly hurt Wilder and the end appeared to be close.</p>
      <p>But Wilder recovered, dropping Ortiz twice in the tenth round for the stoppage.</p>
      <p>Wilder, who is looking at a February rematch with Tyson Fury, is taking a dangerous risk by stepping in the ring with Ortiz.</p>
      <p>Ortiz says being in the U.S. has allowed him to focus on his two dreams, finding a cure for his daughter's disease and becoming heavyweight champion of the world.</p>
      <p>Wilder is set to make 3 million US dollars while Ortiz will take home 1.5 million US dollars.</p>
      <p>The fight program will start at 3pm tomorrow.</p>
