      <p>Kingston College defeated a Clarendon College team 1-0 in the final of the ISSA Champions Cup that have been considered unbeatable on Saturday inside the National Stadium in Kingston, Jamaica thanks to a wonder strike from Renaldo Robinson.</p>
      <p>KC’s 1-0 win came from Robinson’s 63<sup>rd</sup>-minute goal, but in truth, the difference between the teams could have been greater with the way the KC team started the game.</p>
      <p>KC were first to every ball and pressed Clarendon College who did not adjust and lost possession often.</p>
      <p>In fact, there weren’t very many chances for the normally smooth Clarendon College with KC outmuscling them in most areas of the field from the start.</p>
      <p>In fact, the first real chance of the game fell to Robinson, who after receiving a through ball, and with a defender bearing down on him, toe-poked his effort onto the left upright from the right side of the field.</p>
      <p>That chance had come after KC, not for the first time, caught Clarendon in possession.</p>
      <p>The KC captain, Rajiv Gavin, was also guilty of missing a good chance in the first half after Clarendon goalkeeper Prince-Daniel Smith’s attempted grab from a corner fell to his feet and blasted over from six yards.</p>
      <p>There was the thought that KC would rue those misses because Clarendon College had not failed to score this season and they have been known to start slowly.</p>
      <p>They did not get into the game in a real way, finding the KC defensive tactics from midfield too much to deal with.</p>
      <p>The feeling that Clarendon would get back into the game would continue, especially after KC lost their striker, Tyreese Williams, who fell badly after an aerial challenge and broke his arm.</p>
      <p>In the second half, KC got a glorious effort to go ahead when Smith, in attempting to pass the ball out from the back as is Clarendon’s M.O., struck his lob onto a KC attacker and brought him down in an attempt to recover from the error.</p>
      <p>The penalty, taken by Oneeko Allen, was heroically saved by Smith, giving more credence to the idea that Clarendon College would get back into the game.</p>
      <p>But then Robinson turned the game on its head when he picked up a ball, stepped inside his defensive marker and unleashed a 25-yard pile driver that had Smith beaten from the moment it left his boot.</p>
      <p>Clarendon had more possession of the ball after that but it was still KC who were knocking at the door with counter-attacks that were beautiful to watch.</p>
      <p>Clarendon did get a couple of chances, especially through, golden boot winner, Roderick Granville.</p>
      <p>In the end, Clarendon College have finally been beaten but they did walk away with $500,000 (US$3,723) for their troubles.</p>
      <p>KC, outside of the trophy, walked away with $1.4 million (US$10,424) and the bragging rights for being the first team to win the ISSA Champions Cup twice.</p>
      <p>The champions’ skipper, Gavin, was named the competition’s MVP, while his goalkeeper David Martin shared the golden glove award with Smith.</p>
      <p>Granville shared the golden boot award with Jamaica College’s Phillon Lawrence.</p>
