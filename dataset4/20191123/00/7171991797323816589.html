      <h1>IREnE Goes Around</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hackaday.com/author/baggers/" target="_blank">Richard Baguley</a></address>
      <p>Timelapse rigs are awesome because you can spice up your videos with more interesting panning and tilting timelapse shots. So, why not build yourself one? That’s what [td0g] decided to do, and the result is<a href="https://td0g.ca/2018/09/23/camera-slider-2-0-irene-diy/"> IREnE</a>, a rather nice homemade 3DOF rig that fits onto a standard tripod. 3DOF means that it has three degrees of freedom: the camera can be rotated on the tripod, moved linearly on an extending arm away from the tripod head and rotated around its own axis. In other words: it can pan past an object while rotating the camera to keep the object centered in the frame.</p>
      <p>IREnE stands for Inverted Radial Extension Eggtimer, a play on the dual radial nature of the device and how photographers use egg timers for this sort of thing. It’s also a sneaky tribute to a foe of Sherlock Holmes. The rig is driven by three NEMA 17 motors and an ATMega328p, all powered by a Dewalt powertool battery and his own <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2944892">DeWatt power adapter</a>. the rig also has a secondary function with minor modifications as a <a href="https://td0g.ca/2018/12/15/cnc-pancake-printer/">pancake printer</a>.</p>
      <p>Breakfast aside, there are a few caveats to this project. While a tripod is fine for stabilizing a camera on the top of it, offsetting the weight like this makes the tripod unstable. [td0g] did add a few welded stabilizer bars that brace it to more stable, but the whole thing should be used with some caution. The camera sits on a 1-inch square aluminium extruder that [td0g] claims is robust enough to hold his Canon D7, but I am not sure I would trust it with my expensive equipment.</p>
      <p>This is the fifth high-quality build we have seen from [td0g]: we previously covered the <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/05/16/an-impeccably-designed-high-speed-led-flash/">excellent high-speed LED flash</a>, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/01/12/diy-guided-telescope-mount-tracks-like-a-barn-door/">great telescope mount</a>, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/11/14/high-speed-chronograph-looks-like-pro-gear/">high-speed chronograph</a>, and <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/11/02/diy-pyrography-power-supply/">wood-burning ATX power supply hack.</a></p>
