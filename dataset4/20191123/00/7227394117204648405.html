      <h1>Huawei nova 5T Pro specs and design revealed through Android Enterprise listing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=39" target="_blank">Sagar</a></address>
      <p>Huawei announced the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_nova_5t-9803.php">nova 5T</a> back in August and it seems the company will soon follow it up with a Pro variant that has appeared on Google's Android Enterprise website.</p>
      <p>The listing includes the nova 5T Pro's image which reveals the phone looks similar to the vanilla 5T.</p>
      <p>The listing also reveals a few specs of the nova 5T Pro - 5.5" screen, 8GB RAM, and Android Pie.</p>
      <p>The smartphone will come with an NFC chip and a fingerprint reader which is likely located on the right side like the 5T, and it will be available in two storage options - 128GB and 256GB.</p>

      <p>The nova 5T is a rebranded <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/honor_20-9615.php">Honor 20</a> and a Google site back in June <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/honor_20_pro_is_now_google_play_certified_international_launch_probably_imminent-news-37824.php">listed</a> the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/honor_20_pro-9710.php">Honor 20 Pro</a> as the nova 5T Pro, which means it's likely a rebadged 20 Pro and will arrive with a Kirin 980 SoC, 48MP quad camera, and a 4,000 mAh battery with 22.5W fast charging support.</p>
      <p>However, the Honor 20 Pro sports a 6.26" display while the Enterprise listing of the 5T Pro says it will feature a 5.5" screen.</p>
      <p>We'll have to wait for more details to surface to be sure that nova 5T Pro is indeed a rebranded Honor 20 Pro.</p>
