      <p>Recently, a Twitter user by the name of <a href="https://twitter.com/onleaks/status/1197833371516329985?s=12">@OnLeaks</a> has <b>recently posted a tweet which includes pictures</b> of what seems to be the upcoming <a href="https://twitter.com/onleaks/status/1197833371516329985?s=12"><b>Samsung Galaxy S11</b></a> series smartphone. Based on the image, it looks like the upcoming Galaxy device will come with a <b>rectangle camera module</b> which houses around <b>5 image sensors</b> as well as <b>one LED flash</b>.</p>
      <p>Not only that, but it also seems that the smartphone <b>will not be coming with an under-display camera</b>. Instead, it will feature a hole-punch notch towards the middle top of the screen, similar to that of the <a href="https://technave.com/gadget/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-Price-in-Malaysia-Specs-15081.html"><b>Samsung Galaxy Note 10</b></a> series.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, the renders hints that there will only be a <b>USB Type-C port at the bottom,</b> while the 3.5mm audio jack slot seems to be missing. In terms of the sizes can expect to see, there will be a 6.3-inch as well as a 6.7-inch variant of the aforementioned smartphone.</p>
      <p>With all that said, do take all the information provided with a grain of salt due to the fact that Samsung did not provide an official statement in regards to the leaked renders.
