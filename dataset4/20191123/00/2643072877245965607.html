      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">George Ogbolu</a></address>
      <p>Senator Smart Adeyemi has urged members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to work for the victory of the party in next Saturday’s Kogi West supplementary poll.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed Saturday, November 30, for the conduct of the Kogi West supplementary rerun election.</p>
      <p>Recall that the electoral umpire declared the Kogi West Senatorial Rerun inconclusive.</p>
      <p>The senatorial election which was held on Saturday, November 16, 20019, was been contested by twenty-four candidate with the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), <b>Dino Melaye</b> and <b>Smart Adeyemi</b> of the APC leading as the major candidates.</p>
      <p>Adeyemi polled a total of 80,118 votes, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/16/kogi-2019-election-dino-melaye-casts-his-vote/"><u><b>Dino Melaye</b></u></a> had 59,548, leaving a margin of 20,570.</p>
      <p>With 43,127 votes cancelled across the seven LGAs where the election held.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Friday ahead of the supplementary election, the former lawmaker said that despite having a comfortable lead, the party must not give in to overconfidence, but should rather double its efforts.</p>
      <p>Smart Adeyemi said: <i>“We as party members must mobilize and fight like never before, for the remaining votes. We must commence house to house move and telephone contact of the 30,000 PVC holders.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“We must not look at the supplementary election with a view that our opponent is politically paralyzed by now. We must work towards capturing at least 90 percent of the vote.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Our aim is to get 30,000 out of the 31,000 PVC holders of the 40,000 registered voters in the affected areas; whether our opponents are ready or not is secondary.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>He thanked his supporters for their solidarity in last Saturday’s Kogi West Senatorial district election.</p>
      <p><i>“But for now, let us resume with more vigour and determination in our efforts towards the November 30 supplementary election. Let us go from house to house to mobilize people out for the exercise. We must give the election our all,”</i> he said.</p>
