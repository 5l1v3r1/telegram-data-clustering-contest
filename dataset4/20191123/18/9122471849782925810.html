      <h1>ESPN’s Final Prediction For Today’s Nebraska-Maryland Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:30:27+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Two programs that are reeling will have the chance to snap their losing streak this afternoon. Later today, the Nebraska Cornhuskers will take on the Maryland Terrapins.</p>
      <p>Many analysts were confident that Nebraska would be a real threat in the Big Ten this year. Scott Frost is widely considered one of the better offensive minds in college football.</p>
      <p>Nebraska had a 4-2 record midway through the season and seemed well on its way to building something special. All that momentum went away very quickly though, as the team is currently on a four-game losing streak.</p>
      <p>If there was ever a time for the Cornhuskers to snap their losing streak, it’d be this afternoon against the Terrapins. Mike Locksley began the season with back-to-back wins, but the program has now lost its last five games.</p>
      <p>Although betting odds have Nebraska favored by 6.5 points, the ‘Worldwide Leader in Sports’ has Maryland winning the game.</p>
      <p>Per ESPN’s <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=401112210">Football Power Index</a>, the Terrapins have a 51.1 percent chance of defeating the Cornhuskers.</p>

      <p>Nebraska needs to defeat Maryland in order to remain eligible for a bowl game this season.</p>
      <p>Kickoff for this game is at 3:30 p.m. ET from Maryland Stadium.</p>
      <p>You can watch all the action unfold on the Big Ten Network.</p>
