      <p>Oteele who tied the knot to his long time girlfriend has been constantly lambasted about his size and his “fooling”. His wife in a interview with Zionfelix sometime ago said that she was aware of her husband’s foolishness before agreeing to marry.</p>
      <p>This clearly indicates that the bond between the young couple is stronger than criticism from the public.</p>
      <p>Oteele  further noted that some people can’t hide their jealousy and hatred.</p>
      <p>“it used to be spiritual warfare, but they couldn’t win, so now they attack us physically with a malicious, well-calculated plot to tarnish our reputation. What amuses me most is that I  didn’t become great by myself. People call and discourage me to divorce my wife.”</p>
