        <b><a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/45856-eacc-goes-after-sonko-again">Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko</a> on Saturday, November 23, moved to clear the air allegations of suspicious bank transactions were levelled against him by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC).</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sonko directed his anger towards the media and the government agency whom he accused of ganging up to frustrate and intimidate him, by claiming that kickbacks worth Ksh39 million had been traced to his accounts. </p>
      <p>"No amount of intimidation can silence me. The issues raised by a section of gutter press today were raised 2 months ago and I responded," he wrote, in response to a story by <i>The Standard</i> newspaper.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46740-how-sonko-siphoned-millions-nairobi-eacc">a report by <i>The Standard</i></a> on Saturday, November 23, Sonko was involved in a complex web of kickbacks from the companies that had been awarded tenders by his government.</p>
      <p>EACC had alleged that a conspiracy with private companies saw the county boss pocket Ksh39 million through the said transactions.</p>
      <p>Sonko, however, countered the accusations by producing documents portraying his exchanges with EACC officers with a view to clear the air on the issues that have generated controversy.</p>
      <p>Amongst some of the documents he shared included what he stated was a sworn affidavit from November 20, 2019, by the EACC assistant forensic investigator detailing the transactions that his county had undertaken, in an effort to prove that the numbers were adding up as opposed to the claims by EACC that he had received kickbacks from various projects.</p>
      <p>He also shared a document that he alleged to be a tender award agreement between a company identified as Toddy Civil Engineering and the county government to dispute claims that he had issued them with a tender in an unprocedural manner as the agency had insisted. </p>
      <p>The controversial governor also posted a series of videos of his earlier interviews where he had addressed the <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/Sonko%20exposes%20Tony">issues raised by the EACC officers</a> with a view to exonerate himself from the accusations.</p>
      <p>He also went ahead to highlight what his administration had achieved and dismissed the calls from the various government and disgruntled residents a witchhunt.</p>

      <p>"The war against corruption should not be politicized. Show me where I have diverted billions of development money to enrich myself or my family," he dared EACC.</p>
