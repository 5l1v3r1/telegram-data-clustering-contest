        <i>The biographer and historian on the unsung heroines of the Italian resistance, favourite reading – and an encounter with feminist royalty</i>
      </p>
      <p>C<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/caroline-moorehad">aroline Moorehead</a> was born in London in 1944, has written biographies of Bertrand Russell, Freya Stark, Iris Origo and Martha Gellhorn and has been shortlisted for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/09/samuel-johnson-prize-2014-shortlist-announced-memoirs">Samuel Johnson prize</a> and the Costa biography award. Her new book, <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/111/1112542/a-house-in-the-mountains/9781784741402.html"><i>A House in the Mountains</i></a>, tells the story of the women who helped form the Italian resistance during the second world war.</p>
      <p><b>You have written three other books about the resistance. Where did your interest come from?</b><br/>It stems from my interest in human rights. I’ve always been fascinated by courage and how people survive seemingly unsurvivable situations. What I found were these extraordinary people – who were actually ordinary people – who got up in the morning and thought: “No, I’m not going to put up with this any more.”</p>
      <aside>I discovered to my surprise that everyone thinks the Italians had no resistance</aside>
      <p><b>Tell me </b><b>about the </b><b>women in the book.</b><br/>I discovered, to my surprise, that everyone thinks the Italians had no resistance. There were actually 600,000 who joined the resistance; of those, 70,000 were women. Under Mussolini, they were third-class citizens, had no rights, no voice, no equality. It was the women who were the first to rise up and help people.</p>
      <p><b>One of the women, Ada Gobetti, dedicated her </b><b>memoir </b><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Diario-partigiano-Ada-Gobetti/dp/8806219928"><b><i>Diario Partigiano</i></b></a><b> to her friends, saying </b><b>that solidarity founded on simple human rapport was important</b><b>…</b><br/>I’ve always been interested in friendship, particularly female friendship. I’m lucky I’ve had a group of women friends whom I’ve known since I was 20 – we are still close. In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/09/train-in-winter-caroline-moorehead-review"><i>A Train in Winter</i></a> I explored how friendship helped women to survive; they looked after each other; they said our individual lives do not matter more than keeping other people alive. The friendship was intense among the women I write about who went to Auschwitz. Friendship gave them a sense of worth and value.</p>
      <p><b>The mountains are </b><b>evoked as a place of refuge.</b><br/>The extraordinary thing about Turin is that the Alps rise away behind it seemingly forever. What I discovered is that a lot of people went into the mountains to hide. So this city and the mountains behind it, into which people disappeared, seemed such a powerful image.</p>
      <p><b>The book seems resonant in our age of rising fascism in which the word resistance is often used.</b><br/>It is true. Not long ago the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> asked people to comment on <a href="https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/repeating-history-trump-fascist/">describing Trump as a fascist</a>, and people wrote interestingly about it. In an interview in the 1990s, Umberto Eco defined all the things he thought stood out about the Mussolini era; they are incredibly similar to how you’d describe Trump’s America.</p>
      <p><b>What was your research process?</b><br/>I grew up in Italy so it has always been part of my life. Italian war archives are particularly interesting as all the big cities have a resistance archive and the one in Turin is wonderful. I spent a lot of time there – they have collected every bit of documentation, from telegrams to letters to diaries.</p>
      <p><b>Do you enjoy the research process?</b><br/>I love it. I love learning new things. It’s wonderful to be paid to have continuous education. It makes me totally happy.</p>
      <p><b>It’s fascinating what traces a person and societies leave behind.</b><br/>If I’ve learned anything, it’s to leave no stone unturned looking for those traces. Going into an archive is a miracle of privilege – you open the packet and it gives insights, jokes, or nothing at all – it’s a Pandora’s box, and that’s the best feeling. The journey of discovery is, for me, very important. I don’t want to sit in my room doing my research online – I want to get out, as the writer’s life can otherwise be very lonely.</p>
      <p><b>Did you always want to be a writer? </b><br/>Yes, always. Growing up in a family of writers taught me about writers’ lives. My mother died before my first book came out.</p>
      <aside>Before the interview she put out her hand, I passed over $200, she counted it, and said: “Right, two hours”</aside>
      <p><b>How did you become a biographer?</b><br/>I’ve always been fascinated by peoples’ lives. When I left university, because I was a girl, not too much was expected of me in those days. I got married the summer after I left university and we moved to Rome, and I was a psychologist for a year in a child psychiatric hospital. Then I went to work at the Italian version of <i>Playboy</i>, called <i>Playmen</i>, and I wrote naughty captions. I then was a journalist at the <i>Times</i> for a long time. I wrote profiles of people including Shirley Williams, Enoch Powell and Neil Kinnock. I interviewed Simone de Beauvoir, which was fun – she asked to be paid for it in cash. Before we sat down for the interview she put out her hand, I passed over $200, she counted it,, put it down and said: “Right, two hours.” I started doing a column on political prisoners. With my human rights writing I wanted to give identities to people who are traditionally just statistics, and to show that everybody has a story. It was while I was a journalist that I started writing books.</p>
      <p><b>The new book </b><b>blends biography with history…</b><br/>The first seven books I did were all biographies – but, increasingly, I like telling history through individual people or a village or a group of women – so what I’ve tried to do over the past 10 years is to reinvent myself as a historian. I’m so interested in the wider picture of how people lived within their times. I absolutely love history.</p>
      <p><b>What books have shaped your life</b><b>?</b><br/>I went on a journey across the Sahara aged 30 and took Proust with me and absolutely loved it, so that’s been an influence. Reading has been one of the most important things in my life, whether for research, pleasure or reviewing. I read about eight hours a day. I feel uneasy if I have days when I don’t read enough. Reading is a way of losing oneself, and not being locked up with oneself is wonderful.</p>
      <p><b>Wh</b><b>ich books are on your bedside table?</b><br/>Since I spend all day reading nonfiction for research, I like to read fiction at night. I loved Anna Burns’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/31/milkman-anna-burns-review-northern-ireland"><i>Milkman</i></a>. I love <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/tim-winton">Tim Winton</a>. I’ve become really interested in Japanese and Chinese novels, including those by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jan/04/featuresreviews.guardianreview15">Endō</a>. There’s a pile I’ve spent my entire life trying to read but never get round to, including Robert Musil’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview28"><i>The Man Without Qualities</i></a>, which I’ve tried to read about 40 times and now realise I never will.</p>
      <p><b>Which classic novel are you most ashamed not to have read?</b><br/>I’m not terribly good at Dickens – I never liked him as I liked Hardy. I’m appallingly badly read in the Greek and Roman classics. Now that a lot of books are on audio, I try to put classic books I haven’t read on in the car – I did the whole of Trollope and a lot of Dostoevsky like that, and am currently doing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/09/parades-end-ford-madox-ford"><i>Parade’s End</i></a> by Ford Maddox Ford on audio I love listening to books on a long journey.</p>
      <p><b>Do you have a guilty reading pleasure?</b><br/>I really like reading soppy historical novels. I absolutely love <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2014/oct/26/profile-cj-sansom-crime-fiction-history-shardlake">CJ Sansom’s Shardlake series</a>. I also like reading really good historical novels, too; I’m a huge fan of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/hilary-mantel">Hilary Mantel</a>. I love all historical fiction and it’s great if they’re set in a place I’m going to – I read Madeline Miller’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/21/circe-by-madeline-miller-review"><i>Circe</i></a>, set in Greece, in the summer.</p>
      <p><b>Which contemporary authors do you most admire?</b><br/>Hilary Mantel. Tim Winton. Helen Garner. Ali Smith.</p>
      <p><b>What kind of reader were you as a child?</b><br/>I grew up in a house stuffed with books. Both my parents were writers. When my parents built a house in Italy there was no electricity so my father would read to us by the fire – Chekhov and Nancy Mitford. I remember reading <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/aug/31/books-to-give-you-hope-gone-with-the-wind-by-margaret-mitchell"><i>Gone With the Wind</i></a>, aged 12 or 13, and thinking, reading is a total pleasure that will never leave me. I loved Arthur Ransome and <i>Treasure Island</i>. What strikes me now is that there is a fantastic wealth of children’s books. I have a baby granddaughter – she’s 20 months. Books are already exciting for her, including new feely, tactile books that make noises. This book is dedicated to her, baby Stella.</p>
      <p><b>Would you like a biography of your own life written?</b><br/>No. I like to be on the other side. I don’t keep a journal and do my best not to leave a trace.</p>
      <p><b>What are you working on next?</b><br/>A book of history/biography using the life of Mussolini’s daughter to write about what it was like living in Italy during fascism.I hope I will be able to go on writing books until I die. <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/woodham-smith-cecil-1896-1977">Cecil Woodham-Smith</a>, I think, was taken to her coffin when she was writing the second volume on Queen Victoria. Some people annoy me by asking if I’ve retired and I say of course not. I’d like to go on writing until the very end.</p>
