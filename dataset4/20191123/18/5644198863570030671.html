      <p>Skipper Virat Kohli aced the pink-ball challenge with a sparkling 130 not out to help India consolidate their position against Bangladesh on day two of the second and final test at Eden Gardens on Saturday.</p>
      <p>KOLKATA, India: Skipper Virat Kohli aced the pink-ball challenge with a sparkling 130 not out to help India consolidate their position against Bangladesh on day two of the second and final test at Eden Gardens on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Kohli went into India's first day-night test wary of the exaggerated swing of the heavily-lacquered ball but displayed no signs of any discomfort and helped India to 289-4 at lunch.</p>

      <p>Ravindra Jadeja was batting on 12 at the other end with India, leading now by 183 runs, on course for their 12th consecutive home series victory.</p>
      <p>After India resumed on 174-3, Ajinkya Rahane (51) brought up his fourth consecutive 50-plus but fell soon after adding 99 runs with his captain.</p>
      <p>Kohli cover-drove Ebadot Hossain to reach 99 and, with the crowd chanting his name, took two off spinner Taijul Islam to bring up his 27th test century, 20th as test captain.</p>
      <p>He removed his helmet to soak in the applause but the proper celebration happened a little later when he hit Abu Jayed for four consecutive boundaries.</p>
      <p>India triumphed inside three days in the series opener in Indore and a similar thrashing appeared on the cards for Bangladesh who were skittled out for 106 in their first innings.</p>
