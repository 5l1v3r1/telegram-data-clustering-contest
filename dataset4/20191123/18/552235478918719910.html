        <b>Formartine United...0 East Kilbride...4</b>
      </p>
      <p>East Kilbride are in the hat for tomorrow's Scottish Cup fourth round draw after they cruised to victory over Formartine United.</p>
      <p>The Lowland League champions eased past their Highland League opponents in Aberdeenshire thanks to a double from Ruari Paton, plus strikes from Anton Brady and Graeme Holmes.</p>
      <p>It's a huge result for Kilby caretaker boss Jim Paterson, who has won all three games in charge since taking over from Stuart Malcolm.</p>
      <p>And a delighted Paterson said: "The boys were brilliant.</p>
      <p>"We done our homework on Formartine. We had them watched a few times and we warned the boys they would be a physical side.</p>
      <p>"We knew it would be a blood and thunder cup tie and we matched them physically early doors, which is something we aren't really known for.</p>
      <p>"They couldn't live with us and it could have been more. It would be unfair to criticise the boys after the performance so, wanting more goals, that's just me being greedy.</p>
      <p>"As soon as we got the first goal I was confident we'd go on and win the game."</p>

      <p>It was a fantastic day all round for the Lowland League with BSC Glasgow stunning League One East Fife by coming back from 3-1 down to grab a last-gasp goal in a 4-3 win at Bayview, while Bonnyrigg Rose beat Montrose, also of League One, 2-1.</p>
      <p>Kilby are now dreaming of landing a big tie when the draw is made on BBC Scotland's Sportscene programme tomorrow evening.</p>
      <p>The 12 Scottish Premiership sides enter the competition at this stage and Kilby are in with a chance of landing Rangers or a repeat of their 2016 last 16 tie with Celtic.</p>
      <p>Paterson added: "I'll be watching tomorrow. There's been some other great results for the league today with BSC Glasgow and Bonnyrigg winning as well, so you wonder do you want the big tie or do you want one where you have a good chance to progress even further?</p>
      <p>"I'd love a big tie because it gives us all something to look forward to.</p>
      <p>"Everyone will be fighting for their place in the team and that will only help us in terms of our league performances as well."</p>
