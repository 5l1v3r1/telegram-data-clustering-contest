      <h1>Afia Schwarzenegger sarcastically reveals the work done by most awarded female entrepreneurs in Ghana</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:17:50+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/adu/" target="_blank">Adu Sarpeah</a></address>
      <p>Several times <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/women-were-basically-created-by-god-to-chop-mens-money-lutterodt/">Counsellor Lutterdot</a> has posited that no Ghanaian lady can survive without the support of a man especially in the area of finance. Thus, to the best knowledge of Lutterdot, most successful ladies today are all riding on the pocket of big men to do their projects.</p>
      <p>The assertion of Lutterdot looks weird on the surface as some people have argued that some ladies are excessively industrious who don’t need the support of a man to make it big. However, <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/nana-tornado-hits-hard-at-afia-schwar-exposes-more-deeper-secrets-including-afias-pimping-business/">Afia Schwarzenegger</a> has come out today to support Lutterodt.</p>

      <p>In a post on social media specifically Instagram, cantankerous Afia Schwarzenegger defined “ashawo” and per the dictates of her definition, what it means is that almost all successful female entrepreneurs are riding on the deep pockets of big men else they can’t do anything.</p>
      <p><b>“Ashawo in 2019 means : congratulations you are a very successful hard working female entrepreneur !!!!</b> <b>Guys pls be creative n come up with another insult wae ….” She posted on Instagram.</b></p>
      <p><b> </b>For the purpose of clarity, “ashawo” is a common Ghanaian word referred to prostitution.</p>
