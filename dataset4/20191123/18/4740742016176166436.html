      <h1>Lee Johnson explains Tomas Kalas and Taylor Moore absence as Bristol City draw with Nottingham Forest</h1>
      <h2>"Sometimes Tomas thinks he's Superman..."</h2>

      <p>Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson explained why Tomas Kalas and Taylor Moore were missing for the 0-0 draw against Nottingham Forest following Saturday's no-score draw.</p>
      <p>The Robins were unable to break the deadlock and finished the match without a shot on target and unable to make their extra man for the final 40 minutes count.</p>
      <p>And following the game Johnson gave his reaction to a missed opportunity, and cleared up the case of the missing defenders.</p>
      <p>The pair are not expected to be missing for too long, and indeed Kalas could have been pushed into action if needed.</p>
      <p>"Taylor Moore has had a scan on his knee - hopefully it’s not too bad. It could just be bone bruising," said Johnson after the match.</p>

      <p>"But he has got to get it assessed. He's getting swelling on the knee and when you get that at 22 I don't want to risk it. He's got a bright future ahead of him and has done well.</p>
      <p>"He’s due to discuss the scan result on Monday to discuss any exploratory work to be done with the physios but he did train yesterday, but the fluid has stuck in there. It's not worth it as it's not a cup final.</p>
      <p>"Kalas has got a longstanding tendonitis  issue - another byproduct of international training regimes.</p>
      <p>"I think Kalas has got to be stronger - he played on the Sunday and trained fully on the Monday.</p>
      <p>"They didn’t have a gym [with the Czech Republic team] and with tendernitis issue on the knee, you need to load the knee - he's got a regular loading programme back at home and with us.</p>
      <p>"Again, it’s disappointing. It's lesson learned for Kalas himself - because he doesn't want to be missing games, particularly when you've got players like Bailey Wright and Taylor Moore in those positions. He shouldn’t have trained at matchday plus one, it should have been a recovery day.</p>
      <p>"He decided to or they didn't care enough to let him not train because our game was on the Sunday. So it's up to my sports science team to communicate with them on a regular basis.</p>

      <p>"But the player has a responsibility too. Sometimes Tomas thinks he's Superman but he's got to think smartly to extend his career to keep playing at 37-38," explained Johnson.</p>
      <p>City went closest to scoring when And Weimann's second-half cross-shot deflected off a Forest defender and hit the post.</p>
      <p>The Robins also carved out good shooting opportunities for Tommy Rowe and Rodri, but both players ballooned their efforts over the bar when shooting from close range.</p>
      <p>"I thought we made two good opportunities: Rowe and Rodri - and if one of those goes in then we win," said Johnson after the game.</p>
      <p>"There weren’t too many negatives today," he added, as the Robins slip to seventh in the league but made it back to back clean sheets.</p>
