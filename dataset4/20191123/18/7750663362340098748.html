      <p>The Staggies went in front through <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/brian-graham/"><b>Brian Graham</b></a> before <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sean-mcloughlin/"><b>Sean McLoughlin</b></a> equalised for Saints just before half-time.</p>
      <p>St Mirren dominated the second half but left it late to get the winner with Foley firing his shot into the top corner two minutes from time.</p>
      <p>Manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jim-goodwin/"><b>Jim Goodwin</b></a> had made three changes from the team beaten at Tynecastle. Out went the injured <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kirk-broadfoot/"><b>Kirk Broadfoot</b></a> with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/stephen-mcginn/"><b>Stephen McGinn</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tony-andreu/"><b>Tony Andreu</b></a> dropping to the bench. In came <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gary-mackenzie/"><b>Gary MacKenzie</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ryan-flynn/"><b>Ryan Flynn</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ilkay-durmus/"><b>Ilkay Durmus</b></a>.</p>
      <p>County gave a debut in goal to Chelsea loanee Nathan Baxter as one of three changes. Joining him in the starting line-up were <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ross-stewart/"><b>Ross Stewart</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/billy-mckay/"><b>Billy McKay</b></a>, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ross-laidlaw/"><b>Ross Laidlaw</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/michael-gardyne/"><b>Michael Gardyne</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lee-erwin/"><b>Lee Erwin</b></a> all making way.</p>
      <p>Saints had the best chance of the first half, a flashing shot from Durmus that went wide of the target.</p>
      <p>The Turkish forward then turned provider, sending in a corner that fell to Foley whose shot was blocked. From another St Mirren corner, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kyle-magennis/"><b>Kyle Magennis</b></a> blazed a volley over the top.</p>
      <p>County were almost caught out when <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jon-obika/"><b>Jon Obika</b></a> sprung free for the home side. The Englishman made room for a shot but could not keep it on target.</p>
      <p>Saints paid for their wastefulness after 24 minutes when County scored with their first shot on target. It was a clinical finish from Graham who converted from around 12 yards out.</p>
      <p>McKay could have made it two just minutes later only for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/vaclav-hladky/"><b>Vaclav Hladky</b></a> to deny him with a fingertip save.</p>
      <p>Saints responded with an effort from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/danny-mullen/"><b>Danny Mullen</b></a> that went well over the top, but they finally got a shot on target after 43 minutes for an equalising goal.</p>
      <p>Ryan Flynn went down looking for a penalty but, before referee <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/euan-anderson/"><b>Euan Anderson</b></a> could blow, McLoughlin thrashed the loose ball into the net.</p>
      <p>That gave the home team a lift and they started the second half in positive fashion. But Obika's left-foot shot was too weak to beat Baxter before a Durmus attempt was deflected for a corner.</p>
      <p>St Mirren should have moved in front after 73 minutes. Flynn did brilliantly to tee up Durmus but he completely fluffed his shot in front of goal.</p>
      <p>That looked to be a costly miss until Foley took a pass from Andreu and thumped it into the top corner.</p>
