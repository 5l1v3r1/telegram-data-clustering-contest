      <p>Hosts Town trailed 2-0 and 3-1 before dramatically bringing it back to 3-3 with 23 minutes to go through Josh Laurent's second goal.</p>
      <p>But former Town captain Abu Ogogo popped up with a well-taken winner four minutes from time to condemn Shrewsbury to a gut-wrenching defeat.</p>
      <p>On a error-strewn afternoon Town handed their visitors a 2-0 lead early on before grabbing one back only to fall 3-1 behind after a second-half Joe Murphy mistake.</p>
      <p>Ricketts' men showed fine spirit and determination to mount the two-goal comeback with goals from Ollie Norburn and Laurent midway through the second half but former midfielder Ogogo had the final say.</p>
      <p>Ricketts said: "Ultimately we're disappointed in losing the game.</p>
      <p>"I felt we started slowly, gave ourselves an uphill battle by giving some really poor goals away.</p>
      <p>"But the boys didn't half try to climb the uphill battle, we climbed it with 20 minutes to go.</p>
      <p>"Probably with all that euphoria we played the last 20 minutes like we had two minutes to go. Maybe it came a little bit open.</p>
      <p>"There were a few bits of decision-making (that cost us) towards the end. But we showed a lot of character and effort to get back in the game, which was superb.</p>
      <p>"It was played more or less in their half (in the second half) with us pushing. We ended up getting back to 3-3 with momentum with us but we couldn't quite get the winning goal.</p>
      <p>"Maybe we were a little bit too open, too gung-ho, and one little sucker punch means we lose the game."</p>
      <p>Ricketts added: "I felt our changes in the second half (Fejiri Okenabirhie and Ryan Giles) changed the game. We got a lot more control and into good areas for crosses, where a couple of goals came from.</p>
      <p>"We just wanted to go on and get that winning goal."</p>
      <p>Town, who had previously managed 10 clean sheets from 22 games this season, did not look themselves in defence and handed the proportion of Rovers' goals on a silver platter.</p>
      <p>"It's unlike us and disappointing. At 3-3 you just want to consolidate and certainly not lose the game," Ricketts added.</p>
      <p>"We were still pushing, they weren't peppering our goal. It just tipped their way in the end, a thrilling game for the neutral that didn't go our way."</p>
      <p>One of the game's major talking points was the decision by referee Graham Salisbury to deny Louis Thompson - making his first league start for Town - what looked a penalty with Shrews 1-0 down.</p>
      <p>After a storming run Thompson hit the deck under pressure from Rovers defender Alfie Kilgour.</p>
      <p>Five players from both sides were booked in the lengthy handbags that followed.</p>
      <p>Ricketts said: "It's a penalty. I don't quite understand how it isn't.</p>
      <p>"Louis has slowed down because he wants to have a shot and the defender goes into the back of him.</p>
      <p>"You saw the speed he goes around the guy at. He has to slow down to take his shot, the defender goes into the back of him, it's a penalty.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately I've been the recipient of that many times myself, giving penalties away.</p>
      <p>"Why would Louis Thompson go down in the box? To say there's contact but not enough - either there is or there isn't.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't take a lot to put you off your balance when you're running like that. I thought the run shows what Louis Thompson is all about and it should've been a penalty.</p>
      <p>"I asked his opinion. They have a hard game and don't mean to make mistakes</p>
      <p>.</p>
      <p>"He said he didn't think there was enough contact - which means there was contact and it's a penalty."</p>
