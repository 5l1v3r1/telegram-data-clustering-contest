      <p>Benji Kimpioka’s last-minute strike was not only a ‘big moment’ for the teenager but also for Sunderland’s season, according to Phil Parkinson.</p>
      <p>Kimpioka came off the bench to score the late equaliser which salvaged a point for the Black Cats against third-placed Coventry City, and in the process net his first senior league goal.</p>
      <p>The Sky Blues had taken the lead through Dominic Hyam’s goal in the first period and Sunderland looked on course to suffer their first home league defeat of the season - and only their second since they dropped into League One, with the previous reverse also coming at the hands of Coventry, back in April.</p>
      <p>But Kimpioka spared them, when a defeat would have seen them drop even further off the promotion pace and heaped yet more pressure on new boss Parkinson who has endured a very difficult first month in charge, with just two wins in his first 10 games in all competitions.</p>
      <p>“It was a big moment for us and for Benji,” said Parkinson, whose side slipped to tenth, three points outside the play-offs and still eight points from the automatic promotion places.</p>

      <p>“I was delighted for Benji and delighted for the team as well because I felt on the balance of the game we deserved something from it, but for a long time the goal just wouldn’t come for us.</p>
      <p>“It was a calm finish from Benji. He backs himself, he is a confident lad, and it was great for the squad in general.</p>
      <p>“Since I have been here, in the limited amount of time I have had to work with him in training, he is starting to show more end product.</p>
      <p>“At the start when we were playing seven-a-side he was doing lots of step-overs, but we said to him ‘how many goals can you score, how many shots can you get away?’.</p>
      <p>“It was a calm finish from him and he will feel 10ft tall tonight.”</p>
      <p>Kimpioka’s goal may have got his team off the hook, but Coventry could have run away with the game in the first half with striker Amadou Bakayoko failing to convert any of the four clear-cut chances that came his way.</p>
      <p>Parkinson said: “In the first half at times we were masters of our own downfall with some careless passing, we gave the ball away cheaply, but in other parts of the first half we played well and we switched it quickly.</p>
      <p>“Coventry got the goal but even when you look at that, it was a poor backpass which resulted in the corner [which led to the goal].</p>
      <p>“What I was pleased with today was that we kept going and showed bravery to keep playing, and that’s really important.</p>
      <p>“We went a goal down at home, there was a bit of pressure on us because of results in the previous games, but no-one shied away from receiving the ball and we kept on playing and trying to get that goal back.</p>
      <p>“Eventually the goal came for us, and I felt that the effort and bravery of the team meant that we deserved that moment.</p>
      <p>“Because any time you play at home there is pressure on you - that’s the same for any team, not just Sunderland - but I felt that we dealt well with the pressure of the situation and going a goal down today.”</p>
      <p>Sunderland again struggled to make an impact in the final third, and it was not until Parkinson sent on Duncan Watmore and changed system that the tide started to turn, and he was heavily involved in the move that was finished by fellow sub Kimpioka.</p>

      <p>Parkinson said: “In the first half we looked alright in patches, in the second half we went flat for 10 or 15 minutes and it took the changes to give us a lift.</p>
      <p>“I thought some of the deliveries into the box were decent today, but it was the desire to get into the six-yard box - I saw the ball go across goal and just though ‘go on, who’s going to get on the end of this?’.</p>
      <p>“We need to make sure we have players in the right areas when those balls comes into the box.</p>
      <p>“At times when you look at us, there’s Griggy [Will Grigg] in there but the wide players are almost waiting outside the box for it to come back out again.”</p>
      <p>Jordan Willis was carrying a knee injury and was eventually forced off in the second half, and he will be a doubt for Tuesday’s home game against Burton Albion.</p>
      <p>And midfielder George Dobson will sit out the Burton game after collecting his fifth booking of the season.</p>
      <p>Parkinson said: “With Dobbo [Dobson] getting that yellow...games come thick and fast and we might have freshened it up anyway on Tuesday because there are a few players champing at the bit for an opportunity.</p>

      <p>“Conor McLaughlin is available again after suspension and that releases Luke O’Nien to play further up the pitch.</p>
      <p>“As for Jordan, he has a problem with his knee. He has had an injection in it but when he stretched to clear a ball early in the second half he felt it go a bit and it is a concern for us, but equally I thought that Flanno [Tom Flanagan] came on and did well for us - he looked composed and athletic.”</p>
