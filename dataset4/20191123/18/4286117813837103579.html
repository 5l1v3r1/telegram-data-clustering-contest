      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>NCP removes Ajit Pawar as legislature unit leader</li>
        <li>Cong, Sena and NCP move Supreme Court against Maha Governor and swearing-in</li>
        <li>SC would hear the parties' plea at 11:30 am on Sunday</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In a mega turn of events on Saturday morning, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as the 19th Chief Minister of Maharashtra. The development was reported at a time when the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Congress and Shiv Sena were still engaged in talks to arrive at a power-sharing formula before staking claim to form government in Maharashtra. In fact, just a few hours before Devendra Fadnavis took oath as the chief minister, Sharad Pawar had said that the consensus for the chief minister's post was on Uddhav Thackeray.</p>
      <p>Sources have told India Today TV how the BJP, along with the NCP's Ajit Pawar, who has now been sworn in as the state's deputy chief minister, executed the midnight coup in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>It all started on Friday afternoon when Ajit Pawar, Sharad Pawar's nephew, approached Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari in Mumbai with signed letters from all 54 of NCP's winning candidates in the Maharashtra assembly elections, extending his support to Devendra Fadnavis and the BJP.</p>
      <p>Following this, Devendra Fadnavis, who'd been keeping a low profile since the Shiv Sena broke ties with the BJP, reached Raj Bhawan (Governor House) late evening. Devendra Fadnavis staked claim to form the government along with the support of NCP's 54 MLAs and 15 others.</p>
      <p>Having received the NCP's letter of support, Governor Koshiyari informed the Centre, recommended the lifting of President's Rule in the state, paving way for a democratically-elected government.</p>
      <p>On Saturday morning, Governor decided to invite Devendra Fadnavis to form the next government in Maharashtra. While Devendra Fadnavis was sworn-in as the chief minister, Ajit Pawar took oath as the BJP leader's deputy.</p>

        <b>AJIT'S DECISION TO ALIGN WITH BJP AGAINST PARTY LINE: SHARAD PAWAR</b>
      </p>
      <p>NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, who had announced on Friday that there was agreement on making Uddhav Thackeray the chief minister, held a joint press conference with the Shiv Sena leader and said that the decision of his nephew Ajit Pawar to align with BJP was against the party line. He also made it clear that any MLA who aligns with Ajit Pawar would face anti-defection law.</p>

      <p>Three party MLAs who were with Ajit Pawar at Raj Bhavan were also present at the joint press conference and said they were not aware of the fact that oath-taking will be held. They alleged that they were taken to the Governor's house without their consent. They said they did not know they were taken to attend the oath-taking ceremony.</p>
      <p>In fact, some of the rebel MLAs, who attended the oath-taking ceremony of Devendra Fadnavis, were present in the NCP MLAs meeting with Sharad Pawar and some of them have been brought to Delhi via a chartered plane. However, the number of MLAs who have gone back to Sharad Pawar to their support to the NCP chief is not known. NCP chief spokesperson Nawab Malik has claimed only five MLAs are not in contact with the party. The number of MLAs who have been shifted to Delhi is also not known.</p>

        <b>BJP CARRIED OUT 'FURGICAL' STRIKE IN MAHA: UDDHAV</b>
      </p>
      <p>Uddhav Thackeray, who parted ways with the BJP over his demand of a rotational chief minister, slammed the saffron party and said it had carried out the 'furgical' strike in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Taking a dig at the BJP, Uddhav Thackeray said earlier the party was playing the 'EVM khel' and now "this is the new khel [game]".</p>
      <p>"Earlier EVM 'Khel' was going on and now this is new 'Khel.' From here onwards I don't think elections are even needed. Everyone knows what Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj did when betrayed and attacked from behind. Let them try to break Shiv Sena MLAs, we will not keep quiet," Uddhav Thackeray said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>BJP CONTRACT KILLER OF DEMOCRACY: CONGRESS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Addressing a press conference hours after Devendra Fadnavis was administered the chief minister's oath by the Maharashtra Governor, Congress slammed the BJP and termed it a "contract killer of the democracy". Terming the swearing-in of Devendra Fadnavis as chief minister a black chapter in India's democracy, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala alleged the BJP threatened Ajit Pawar into joining hands with it.</p>

      <p>He alleged that Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari did not make effort to verify Devendra Fadnavis' claims of having the support of a majority of MLAs before administering the chief minister's oath to him.</p>
      <p>"Devendra Fadnavis had promised to put Ajit Pawar in jail but has made him the deputy chief minister now," Randeep Surjewala said, adding, "Modi hai toh mumkin hai [It is possible if PM Modi is there]"</p>
