      <h2>How can Steve Bruce ensure that John McGinn doesn't impact Monday's contest?</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> have an important match this weekend, with a trip to Villa Park on the horizon for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a>'s men.</p>
      <p>Aston Villa are currently 17th in the Premier League and are four points below United, but Monday's fixture could change that drastically.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the contest, John McGinn has been identified as one of Dean Smith's better players. He's considered as integral to his side and their performances, so an emphasis will be placed on the Newcastle boss to devise a means of stopping the Scotsman.</p>
      <p>How exactly may that be achieved, though?</p>
      <p>Since being promoted, McGinn has appeared completely unfazed despite the step up in quality.</p>
      <p>He's currently Villa's second-top scorer behind only Â£22m signing Wesley with four, having bagged three so far despite playing in central midfield. The 24 year-old seems to have retained plenty of the qualities that influenced his success in the Championship last year.</p>
      <p>McGinn is quite an all-rounder, with a solid contribution to virtually every phase of play. In particular, though, he's inclined to offer a scoring threat and that is what United should be most concerned about.</p>
      <p>Last season, 42 central midfielders amassed over 2,500 minutes in the Championship, and McGinn finished third for Expected Goals (xG) per 90.</p>
      <p>xG offers an insight into the likelihood of a shot being scored by considering aspects such as difficulty and location, and it tends to provide an accurate summary of whether a player deserved fewer or more goals based on his shots.</p>
      <p>McGinn's xG was higher than most largely because he took plenty of shots during matches, with an average of 2.2 per 90 also placing him in third position based on the group of 42 central midfielders.</p>
      <p>His shot map for that season is pictured below, and it showcases his tendency of attempting to find the net from distance.</p>

      <p>This time around, McGinn's threat seems to have largely remained. He's played considerably fewer minutes in comparison, but his shots per 90 is up from 2.2 to 2.6 per 90.</p>
      <p>A reason for the midfielder taking more shots may be Tammy Abraham's departure. The Chelsea striker is a more clinical penalty box player than Wesley, meaning that other players have since had to contribute more offensively.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian striker is less inclined to shoot, but more likely to involve others, hence why McGinn's offensive threat has risen somewhat, with an example of the two linking up pictured below.</p>

      <p>From a United perspective, allowing the Scottish international to shoot from distance may not be too problematic. He's attempted 20 shots from outside the box this season, hitting the target only five times and scoring none. If he's closed down enough to be distracted, then it's unlikely that United will suffer from his long-range shooting.</p>
      <p>His tendency to make forward runs into the box should be deemed as the real threat by Bruce, though, as he seems to have an instinct regarding arriving in the right space at the right time. His runs have to be tracked by United and the team's midfielders have to ensure that discipline is present without possession.</p>
      <p>Wesley has to be carefully managed, as central defenders seem prone to engaging in aerial battles with him which consequently allows McGinn to dart forwards into spaces that tend to open up.</p>
      <p>The visiting side may benefit from using their customary back five formation, as once a central defender vacates his position to challenge for an aerial ball, his space can be covered by one of the other two centre-backs which should prevent a channel opening for McGinn.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the Scottish midfielder is a threat but providing his shots from distance are closed down but welcomed, and his forward runs are managed, then it's reasonable to suggest that United will be able to control his danger.</p>
