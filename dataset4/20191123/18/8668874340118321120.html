      <p><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/wasps-wing-apologises-for-behaviour-in-aftermath-of-red-card/">Wasps</a> got their European Challenge Cup campaign up and running with a 32-14 win over <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/agen">Agen</a> at the Ricoh Arena. The home side, beaten away in their Pool 3 opener to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> Begles last weekend, had trailed to a converted try from Loris Tolot.</p>
      <p>Ashley Johnson, though, went over from a maul before Jacob Umaga’s kicking extended the lead to 13-7 at the break. Further tries from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/wasps/players/tommy-taylor/">Tommy Taylor</a> and Johnson put <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/wasps">Wasps</a> in command, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulon/players/malakai-fekitoa/">Malakai Fekitoa</a> crossing to secure the bonus point. Fernandez Correa added a late consolation for the hosts.</p>
      <p>London Irish ran in seven tries to beat <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/bayonne">Bayonne</a> 45-31 in their Pool 2 match at the Madejski Stadium. The Exiles, beaten 20-16 against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/scarlets">Scarlets</a> last time out, scored five tries in the first half – during which the French club also crossed four times to go into the break at 31-24.</p>
      <p>Converted tries for Saia Fainga’a and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/london-irish/players/ben-meehan/">Ben Meehan</a> gave the hosts some breathing space. A late score for former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins">Harlequins</a> number eight Mat Luamanu, his second of the match, secured Bayonne a bonus point.</p>
      <p>Stand-off <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/perpignan/players/paddy-jackson/">Paddy Jackson</a> completed five conversions, including one from his own try after 25 minutes, to finish with a personal haul of 14 points.</p>

      <p>Saturday’s early kick-off in Pool 1 saw <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/worcester">Worcester</a> Warriors beaten 17-9 away at Castres. <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/worcester/players/duncan-weir/">Duncan Weir</a> kicked three penalties for the visitors, however first-half tries for winger <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulon/players/filipo-nakosi/">Filipo Nakosi</a> and flanker <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/castres/players/baptiste-delaporte/">Baptiste Delaporte</a> proved enough for the French side.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, in Pool 4, Stade Francais picked up a much-needed 13-12 win at Zebre. The Paris club – bottom of the Top 14 and having seen coach Heyneke Meyer depart – scored a converted try from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/stade-francais/players/gael-fickou/">Gael Fickou</a>, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/stade-francais/players/nicolas-sanchez/">Nicolas Sanchez</a> adding two penalties. The Italians, though, made a late fight back with a penalty try setting up a tense finale.</p>
