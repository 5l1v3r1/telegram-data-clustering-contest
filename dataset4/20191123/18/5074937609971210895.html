      <h1>Ho-Urban gets more improved toilets under Urban Sanitation in 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:23:33+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:23</time> by <a rel="author">Caleb Kuleke, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Ho, Nov. 23, GNA - Mr Aaron Kofi Amedzro, Ho Municipal Environmental Health Officer, has said a total of 3,442 improved toilet facilities have been constructed within the Ho-Urban areas in 2019 under the Urban Sanitation programme.</p>
      <p> He said 2,571 facilities were constructed in 2018 under the same programme.</p>
      <p>He said his outfit was making efforts to ensure that every household and institution within the Municipality had improved toilet facility to reduce open defecation and prevent diseases.</p>
      <p>Mr Amedzro, who was speaking to the Ghana News Agency in an interview in Ho on World Toilet Day, said the Municipality was progressing steadily in terms of the number of improved households and institutional toilet facilities and called for support from all.</p>
      <p>He underscored the importance of the theme for this year’s celebration; “Leaving no one behind” saying “when it comes to public health no one must be behind, all of us must go together” and make the necessary effort to ensure that the nation’s quest for improved environment for healthy living was achieved.</p>
      <p>Mr Amedzro said as part of the celebration, his outfit is engaging some communities on the need to have household toilets and negative effects of open defecation.</p>
      <p>He said the only way open defecation could end was to ensure that households and institutions have improved toilet facilities that was why they issued a four-month moratorium last year October.</p>
      <p>Mr Amedzro said though the moratorium ended January this year, they were unable to prosecute people because more people were still acquiring the Basic Sanitation Fund to enable them fix the facility.</p>
      <p>He said his outfit would soon begin prosecution and urged households and institutions without toilet facilities to quickly fix them to avoid prosecution.</p>
