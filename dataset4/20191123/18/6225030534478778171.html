      <p>Corey Nakatani, a 10-time Breeders’ Cup-winning jockey, has called it a career.</p>
      <p>Nakatani’s son and agent, Matt Nakatani, posted a news release Saturday afternoon on Twitter announcing his 49-year-old father’s retirement.</p>
      <p>Corey Nakatani hasn’t raced since August 2018, when he injured in his back in a spill at Del Mar.</p>
      <p>“The time has come to officially announce my retirement from the sport of horse racing,” the Covina, Calif., native Nakatani said in the release. “Although I never imagined this was how my career would end, I am very proud of my accomplishments and know that I competed at the very highest of levels, which gives me a sense of satisfaction.</p>
      <p>“This game gave a young kid from Covina purpose in life and I will forever be grateful for the opportunities it has given me. Without these amazing horses, I never would have considered my family and myself so blessed.”</p>
      <p>Nakatani finished his career with 3,909 winners out of 23,740 starts, earning $234,554,534 aboard his mounts. He boasts 120 Grade 1 wins, 341 graded stakes victories and 10 Southern California Riding Titles.</p>
      <p>Nakatani won his first two Breeders’ Cup races in 1996 with Jewel Princess (Distaff) and Lit de Justice (Sprint) and his last in 2012 aboard Tapizar (Dirt Mile). His best Triple Crown finish was a second-place run with Nehro in the 2011 Kentucky Derby.</p>
      <p>Nakatani served as go-to rider for trainers Bobby Frankel, Steve Asmussen, D. Wayne Lukas, Bob Baffert, Richard Mandella, Jerry Hollendorfer and Nick Zito at various points of his career.</p>
      <p>Some of Nakatani’s notable mounts included Tapizar, Lava Man, Sandpit, My Miss Aurelia, Sarafan, Thor’s Echo, Aragorn, Silic, Sweet Catomine, Lit de Justice, Serena’s Song, Lite Light, General Challenge, Sharp Cat, Reraise, Elmhurst, Jackson Bend, Regally Ready, Bolt d’Oro and Shared Belief.</p>
      <p>A winner’s circle ceremony will take place Nov. 30 at Del Mar, followed by a reception. Nakatani and his family extended an invitation to any and all friends, colleagues, owners, and trainers who are welcome to attend.</p>
