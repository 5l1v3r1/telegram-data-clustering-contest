      <h4>Cody Rhodes weighs-in on new WWE IC title</h4>
      <p>This week's episode of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> SmackDown, the final episode of the show before this Sunday's WWE <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">Survivor Series</a>, featuring the somewhat shocking debut of not a new WWE Superstar, but a new version of the Intercontinental Championship belt.</p>
      <p>The title is arguably one the most prestigious in pro wrestling history, and while the color of the belt strap has varied over the years, the plates have remained the same, and are considered legendary at this point.</p>
      <p>All that changed on WWE SmackDown this week, when Sami Zayn awarded current IC Champion Shinsuke Nakamura with a new version of the belt, and the new title design has been met with mostly positive reviews from fans online, with some fans also reject the idea that WWE would change such a historic title belt.</p>

      <p>One name who helped infuse new life into the WWE IC title is former Champion and current AEW star Cody Rhodes, who famously brought the white strap back to the title during one of his more famous IC title reins.</p>
      <p>When a fan on Twitter supposed that WWE created the new IC title design to retaliate against Cody Rhodes once holding the famous strap, Cody responded, saying he feels the theory is unlikely, and that WWE might have felt that it's time for a change to the iconic title.</p>
