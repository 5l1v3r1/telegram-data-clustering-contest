      <p><b>YORK, Pa.Â (AP)</b> - A man has been convicted in the hit-and-run death of a 4-year-old girl struck by a van in Pennsylvania three years ago.</p>
      <p>Jurors in York County deliberated for about five hours before convicting 35-year-old Tony Shower Jr. on Friday of accidents involving death or personal injury/hit and run and driving under the influence.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said the van never slowed before or after hitting 4-year-old Dakota Wright in Hanover in November 2016. Shower's friend testified the men had been smoking crack cocaine and Shower had used heroin.</p>
      <p>Defense attorney Eric White said the other man was driving and his client was sleeping in the passenger seat. A neighbor, however, testified only one person was in the van, and authorities said the description he gave matched Shower, not his friend.</p>
