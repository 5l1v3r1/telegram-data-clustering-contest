      <h1>Exeter Chiefs and Henry slayed Glasgow</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:04:41+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:04</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Exeter <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/chiefs">Chiefs</a> continued their impressive start to their Champions Cup campaign with a bonus-point 34-18 victory over <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow">Glasgow</a> at Sandy Park.</p>
      <p>After last’s week superb 31-12 win at La Rochelle, Exeter backed it up with a convincing win over the Scots, who were run ragged in the second half.</p>
      <p>It was not always plain-sailing for the Chiefs as they trailed 13-10 at the interval but a much improved second-half performance saw them totally dominate an out-gunned Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Jonny Hill, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/henry-slade/">Henry Slade</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/sam-simmonds/">Sam Simmonds</a> and Tom O’Flaherty scored their tries with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/joe-simmonds/">Joe Simmonds</a> converting all four and adding two penalties.</p>
      <p>Nick Grigg and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow/players/george-turner/">George Turner</a> scored Glasgow’s tries with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland/players/adam-hastings/">Adam Hastings</a> kicking two penalties and a conversion.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Glasgow made an explosive start with an excellent break from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland/players/sam-johnson/">Sam Johnson</a> and good support from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland/players/george-horne/">George Horne</a> winning a five- metre scrum but they could not capitalise on that position as they conceded a penalty for not releasing.</p>
      <p>However the Scots were not to be denied for long as <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland/players/tommy-seymour/">Tommy Seymour</a> burst through the home defence to set up the opening try for Grigg.</p>
      <p>Hastings converted from in front of the posts but his side were pinged at a scrum with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/joe-simmonds/">Joe Simmonds</a> stepping up to kick a straightforward penalty.</p>

      <p>Glasgow led 7-3 at the end of an evenly contested first quarter in which their centres, Johnson and Grigg, troubled the home defence with their probing runs which contrasted with some well-judged box kicking from Chiefs’ scrum-half Nic White.</p>
      <p>White’s kicking helped in giving his a pack a period of dominance and after 27 minutes, they took the lead when Hill finished off a succession of forward drives by forcing his way over.</p>

      <p>Joe Simmonds converted before the visitors suffered another setback when wing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow/players/ratu-tagive/">Ratu Tagive</a> was forced to leave the field with a back problem but the Scots regained the advantage when Hastings succeeded with two penalties in quick succession to leave his side 13-10 ahead at the break.</p>
      <p>It took only 90 seconds after the restart for Exeter to score their second try. A basic handling error from the Scots surrendered possession and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/jack-nowell/">Jack Nowell</a> made them pay by evading two defenders to send Slade over.</p>

      <p>Glasgow’s poor start to the second half continued when they first lost another wing through injury with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow/players/dth-van-der-merwe/">DTH Van Der Merwe</a> hobbling off before <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/sam-simmonds/">Sam Simmonds</a> finished off a driving line-out to put Exeter firmly in control.</p>
      <p>The Scots continued to fall apart and they soon conceded a fourth try when O’Flaherty easily won the race to touchdown after a skilful kick ahead from Slade had created the opportunity.</p>
      <p>Glasgow lost replacement <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow/players/kiran-mcdonald/">Kiran McDonald</a> to a yellow card for an off-the-ball incident with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership-cup/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/joe-simmonds/">Joe Simmonds</a> knocking over the resulting penalty before his brother Sam joined McDonald in the bin for a deliberate offside.</p>
      <p>Glasgow took advantage of the number eight’s absence to score their only points of the second half when Turner crossed with 90 seconds remaining.</p>
