      <p>Mangalagiri MLA Alla Ramakrishna Reddy has created a flutter by alleging that former District Collector and Commissioner, Civil Supplies, Kona Sasidhar and District Revenue Officer P. Srinivasulu had worked against him in the previous elections.</p>
      <p>He also said that several officers who have been against the YSR Congress Party have been given key postings in this government too.</p>
      <p>Even as Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy went hammer and tongs against the officers at the District Review Committee meeting, Minister for Housing and district in-charge Minister Ch. Ranganatha Raju and Minister for Marketing Mopidevi Venkata Ramana Rao asked him to exercise restraint and said that this was not a meeting to discuss such things.</p>
      <p>Stating that such remarks had no precedence in the District Review Committee meeting, the Ministers asked the MLA to control himself. Many MLAs too urged Mr. Reddy to restrain himself.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy had moved a resolution seeking to ban TDP MLC Nara Lokesh from attending the DRC meetings.</p>
