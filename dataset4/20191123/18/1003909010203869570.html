      <h1>Calgarians get back to basics with bike tour of Eastern Europe and Asia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:53:05+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:53</time> by <a rel="author">Emily and Trevor Gair</a></address>
      <p>Trevor and Emily Gair had a comfortable life as lawyers in Calgary but left it all behind to see the world by bicycle. Since January, they have pedalled more than 5,000 kilometres through nine countries and are currently kicking back in India. By the time a year is up and they return home for Christmas, they hope to have made it across Africa, Central Asia, and the Indian Subcontinent.</p>
      <p>They created a blog, <a href="https://breakingtrailtravel.wordpress.com/">Breaking Trail</a>, mostly to keep their families apprised of their journey, and have shared some of the details of their eye-opening trip.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Where did you go?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We started in Tbilisi, Georgia, and cycled through Azerbaijan before taking a cargo vessel across the Caspian Sea. From there, we biked portions of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, southern Kyrgyzstan, western China, Pakistan and, finally, to India.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why cycle touring?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The cool thing about cycle touring is that you travel more slowly and to places you may not otherwise go. For example, most tourists to Uzbekistan only visit the ancient Silk Road cities of Khiva, Bukhara and Samarkand. On our bikes we were able to explore these fascinating centres, but also travelled through sections of rural Uzbekistan where we met people who rarely interact with foreigners. This includes <a href="https://breakingtrailtravel.wordpress.com/2019/07/17/which-way-to-the-pamir-highway">the time</a> we were invited to crash a coming-of-age party with more than 200 locals in attendance.</p>
      <p>It’s a self-contained way to travel and explore. You carry everything you need to ride, sleep, eat and survive. In our case, we cycled with four panniers (waterproof bags) attached to each bike. These housed all of our gear, including our tent, sleeping bags, sleeping bags, pot, stove, utensils, bike repair kit, clothes, toiletries, food, etc.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why did you embark on this journey?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We got married in June of last year and, before we did the stuff we are supposed to do (mortgages and babies, etc.), we wanted to have an adventure! Exploring new lands and cultures, overcoming challenges and making memories that would last a lifetime — we couldn’t think of a better way to start our new life together.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How did each of your parents react when you told them of your plan?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Trevor’s parents travelled for two years in Asia and Eastern Europe shortly after their wedding, so they were ecstatic. Emily’s parents were a bit more anxious. But they trusted that we had done our research and had faith in our judgment. Furthermore, Emily’s older brother is a professional rock climber so it’s safe to say her parents are somewhat more desensitized than most.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Did you ever think you weren’t going to complete the journey?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, definitely. We both had doubts about whether we would make it all the way to India. And on some particularly steep sections of rough road in Tajikistan, Emily thought more than once about “accidentally” throwing her bike into a river.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Were you ever afraid?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, while biking through Xinjiang province in western China. Here, the Chinese government has implemented an aggressive surveillance state. CCTV cameras are everywhere and the authorities frequently stop people to question them. As a result, we were very cautious.</p>
      <p>On one occasion, we were pulled over on a deserted section of the highway and the police demanded to search our phones and camera. Despite our protests, they deleted some photos.</p>
      <p>At other times, we were followed for hours by an undercover car. Though unnerving at first, we eventually came to pity the poor guy behind the wheel. It must have been incredibly boring as we were averaging 16 kilometres/hour.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are the biggest learnings from the last five months on the bike?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We are beyond lucky to call Canada home, where the value of equality is core to our nation’s identity, where opportunities are only capped by one’s imagination, where our thoughts and words aren’t censored, and where the vast majority have clean water and clean air.</p>
      <p>The world is not as scary as we are led to believe.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What was the best day of your journey?</b>
      </p>
      <p>One day that stands out was our third day riding through the <a href="https://breakingtrailtravel.wordpress.com/2019/08/07/to-zorkul-and-beyond">Zorkul Nature Reserve</a> in southeastern Tajikistan. The reserve is an alpine grassland that sits 4,000 metres above sea level. Facing south, we saw both a sliver of Afghanistan known as the Wakhan Corridor and one of the most fabled mountain ranges in the world — the Hindu Kush.</p>
      <p>By this point we had last seen a shop three days prior and so we were running low on food. Thankfully, we were able to replenish when we came across a cluster of huts occupied by Tajik goat herders. They sold us hand-churned butter and fresh bread that had been cooked over an animal-dung fire. That night we camped beside a lake at 4,280 metres and were treated to a remarkable sunset. It was magical.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What was the hardest day of your journey?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The day we cycled by a memorial dedicated to four cyclists killed in a 2018 terrorist attack in Tajikistan. Two of the victims were Jay and Lauren, an American couple about our age who had quit their jobs to bike around the world. In preparing for our trip, we had relied heavily on their blog and were familiar with their story. They had similar lives to ours and, likely, similar dreams. We were overcome by emotion when we stopped at the memorial.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What is one thing that was indispensable for you on your journey?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The one thing in our kit that is indispensable is our water purification system. We rely on a SteriPen, which uses ultraviolet light to purify water. This meant we could drink from almost any stream or tap and didn’t have to buy bottled water.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How did you manage repairs in such remote areas?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Spare bike parts and mechanical expertise were scarce. We brought from home some basic repair tools and parts which would solve most of the problems we expected to encounter. For others, such as when Emily snapped a spoke in Kyrgyzstan, we found a man in the bazaar who was able to twist a spare spoke he had down to the correct size and insert it into her wheel. As for Trevor’s front wheel which became wobbly following a small crash — it still wobbles 1,500 kilometres later.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What did you miss most about home?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Other than friends and family, we missed Americanos from The Roasterie in Kensington.</p>
