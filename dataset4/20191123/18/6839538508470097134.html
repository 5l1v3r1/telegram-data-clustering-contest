      <p>Health Minister Greg Hunt has written to private health insurers to tell them their proposed premium rises for 2020 are too high, a media report says.</p>
      <p>It's believed the industry is asking for a rise of 3.5 per cent, up from the 3.25 per cent they were allowed for 2019.</p>
      <p>"I have written to private health insurers, asking them to deliver lower premium changes for consumers," Mr Hunt told The Sunday Telegraph.</p>
      <p>"Their proposed changes for premiums in their first applications were too high. Our reforms have delivered the lowest premium changes in 17 and 18 years consecutively. I am determined to deliver the lowest average premium changes in 19 years."</p>
      <p>However, private health insurers have warned that claims are growing faster than revenue and they may be forced to cut costs, including provision for some medical devices and payments to doctors.</p>
