      <p>Roman Kemp continues his I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! stint tonight, as the show airs on ITV1.</p>
      <p>The son of Spandau Ballet star Martin has become a favourite among viewers since the show launched last Sunday (November 17).</p>
      <p>And, as the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/im-celebrity-star-roman-kemps-17298471">Manchester Evening News reports</a> , the 26-year-old went through a serious body transformation before heading Down Under.</p>
      <p>The Capital FM Breakfast presenter spent 12-weeks dedicating himself to his health and fitness with the help of Caroline Flack's personal trainer, Bradley Simmonds.</p>
      <p>Showcasing the fruits of his labour on Instagram, the radio host impressed his social media followers with before and after snaps.</p>

      <p>He wrote on Instagram back in August: "Not one for posting a photo like this but I wanted to say a huge thank you to @bradleysimmonds for convincing me to do his #12weektransformation.</p>
      <p>"Best training I've ever had and provided me with the results I wanted. Thank you mate."</p>

      <p>"Roman Kemp is absolutely ridiculous. Stunning, stunning man. Like the eyes," one fan gushed.</p>
      <p>Another added: "I actually fancy roman kemp so much, it’s becoming a problem. #imaceleb."</p>
      <p>"Roman crying over a wagon wheel is already my highlight of this series #imaceleb," a third Twitter user has written this week.</p>
      <p>A final comment read: "Didn’t know how much i needed to see roman kemp crying over half a wagon wheel until now #imaceleb."</p>
