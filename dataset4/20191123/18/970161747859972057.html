      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a> attempted to take encouragement from a 20-minute spell in the second half as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> laboured to a 2-2 draw against lowly Southampton.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have now won just once in their last eight matches in all competitions and required an injury time goal from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/alexandre-lacazette/">Alexandre Lacazette</a> to salvage a point against a side who remain in the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>Although the introduction of Nicolas Pepe at the start the second half coincided with the home side’s best spell of the match, they were unable to capitalise and looked destined for a first home defeat against Southampton since 1987 when James Ward-Prowse pounced on the rebound after his penalty had been saved in the 71st minute.</p>
      <p>‘We are disappointed and frustrated so I understand the supporters,’ said Emery afterwards.</p>
      <p>‘We know feeling comfortable here is the key but we didn’t do that.’</p>

      <p>Emery stuck with the 3-5-2 formation he implemented in the recent defeat at Leicester before reverting to a back four in the second half when his side were changing the game.</p>

      <p>Explaining his constant tinkering with formations, he added: ‘That decision is because I need to find a solution.</p>
      <p>“We play three centre-backs to feel better defensively. I changed it because we needed to attack more but we lost a bit of balance.</p>
      <p>‘I need to work, analyse and find a solution.</p>
      <p>‘The best 20 minutes of the whole season came at the start of the second half but they scored when we were better maybe.</p>
      <p>‘We draw at the last moment but it’s not enough.’</p>
