      <h1>Chorley 1 Torquay United 0: Gary Johnson fumes after Gulls lose to bottom club</h1>
      <h2>Marcus Carver's 24th minute header inflicted a third successive league and cup defeat on the Gulls,</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:46:41+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:46</time> by <a rel="author">Devon Live</a></address>
      <p>Torquay United manager Gary Johnson pulled no punches after a side without injured leading scorer Jamie Reid slumped to a 1-0 defeat away to the National League's bottom club Chorley.</p>
      <p>Marcus Carver's 24th minute header inflicted a third successive league and cup defeat on the Gulls, prompting Johnson to say:"You wouldn't have realised who was bottom of the league and who was nearer the top.</p>
      <p>"It was a poor performance from us.  I am very disappointed with our team and our group, because they beat us in every area.</p>
      <p>"Credit to them, they played a particular game and we couldn't handle it.</p>
      <p>"We have still got an obligation to our supporters, to try and entertain them, and we did absolutely nothing today.</p>
      <p>"The last two or three games have been like that, so it's going to take something to turn it round.</p>
      <p>"We will work hard with them, but it might not be this group we work hard with - we may have to try and get some people in."</p>

      <p>On a day when the top-two, Barrow and Bromley, both won again to go three points clear, Torquay slipped a place to seventh, six points behind the leaders ahead of another trip to mid-table Eastleigh next Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Their selection problems continue.  Although Johnson had Jake Andrews back, Reid (foot) and Frank Vincent (ankle) joined an eight-strong injury list, Reid missing a game for the first time since March 2018</p>
      <p>For the third successive game - defeats to Maidstone (0-1) in the FA Cup, Sutton (1-2) at home and now Chorley - United's previously free-scoring attack stuttered.</p>
      <p>In fact, if it hadn't been for recalled goalkeeper Shaun MacDonald, the Gulls would have suffered a heavier defeat.</p>
      <p>Not only did MacDonald save Charles Vernam's 52nd minute penalty, he also came up with a series of other stops in both halves.</p>
      <p>United, with Swansea City loanee Joe Lewis brought into a defensive back-three, struggled to cope with the threat of Chorley's attacking full-backs Matt Challoner and Adam Blakeman.</p>
      <p>It was a move between Challoner and Mark Ross on their right which gave Carver the chance to head Ross' cross past MacDonald from ten yards for what turned out to be the winner.</p>
      <p>It wasn't until just before and just after half-time that the Gulls got going, Ben Whitfield twice and Andrews going close.</p>
      <p>MacDonald kept United in the game with his save from Vernam's spot-kick, diving low to his left after the Grimbsy Town loanee had been fouled by Matt Buse.</p>
      <p>With Ruairi Keating and Manny Duku on for Lewis and Kalala, United pressured the home defence midway through the second half, Buse having a goalbound shot blocked and one Keating cross inches away from laying on an equaliser.</p>
      <p>Clear chances were still at a premium, while Chorley continued to threaten on the counter-attack, midfielder Nortei Nortey twice going close to a clinching second goal.</p>
