      <h1>ISD charged to intensify education on referendum</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:20:11+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:20</time> by <a rel="author">Caleb Kuleke, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Ho, Nov. 23 GNA - Dr Archibald Yao Letsa, Volta Regional Minister, has called on the Information Service Department (ISD) to intensify the awareness creation efforts on the impending referendum for the citizenry to make informed decision.</p>
      <p>â€œI want to appeal to the Information Service Department and other institutions to intensify their educational campaign on the issue of the referendum for the people to grasp the message," he said.</p>
      <p>Dr Letsa was speaking at a Parliamentary Select Committee on Local Government and Rural Development Town Hall engagement of a cross section of people and the media on the upcoming referendum in Ho.</p>
      <p>The Regional Minister said the impending referendum has become a contentious subject matter because many people seemed not well informed thus the need for a comprehensive education.</p>
      <p>He urged the participants to serve as worthy ambassadors and educate others on the referendum and what it clearly sought to achieve and also urged them to vote "yes."</p>
      <p>Mr Benjamin Yeboah Sekyere, Member of Parliament for Tano South and Deputy Minister for Ahafo Region, said it is time to have multi-party democracy at the local level.</p>
      <p>He said having democracy at the grassroots would deepen the country's democratic and accountability process and charged the citizenry to vote "yes."</p>
      <p>Mr Robert Amoah, Member of Parliament for Achiase Constituency, said political party participation in local level elections would help do away with the system of winner takes all, hence the necessity to vote "yes."</p>
