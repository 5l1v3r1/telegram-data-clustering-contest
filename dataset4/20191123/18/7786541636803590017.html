      <p><b>TEL AVIV, IsraelÂ (AP)</b> - The chief challenger to Israel's embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is proposing to lead a unity government with Netanyahu's Likud party.</p>
      <p>Blue and White candidate Benny Gantz says Saturday he would head the government for two years and then Netanyahu would lead the following two years - if he is acquitted of corruption charges.</p>
      <p>Gantz says it's the "only way to avoid unnecessary elections that no one wants."</p>
      <p>It was Gantz's first concrete offer to extract Israel from its political impasse since the country's attorney general announced Thursday Netanyahu would be indicted.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu currently heads a caretaker government after two inconclusive elections. Previous efforts at a power-sharing agreement between the two largest parties failed. Netanyahu has vowed to remain in office.</p>
