      <h3>What's the weather going to be like?</h3>
      <p>It looks like we are in luck. The weather looks like it's going to be kind to stall-keepers and the general public alike. At the moment the Bureau of Meteorology is predicting a cool start, working up to a high of 23C, with light winds during the day. Pretty much the ideal weather to be strolling around the stalls around Lake Wendouree.</p>
      <p>See the latest <a href="https://www.thecourier.com.au/weather/">Ballarat weather</a> here.</p>
      <h3>Where can I park?</h3>
      <p>There should be room to park at Victoria Park across Sturt Street, where there will be shuttle-buses taking people to the lake. You can also cross Sturt Street and find your own way across. Google Maps estimates a walk of around seven minutes from the car park to the lake's shore. You can also park at North Gardens Reserve.</p>
      <p>Note that traffic around the lake will only go in one direction (clockwise), with the inside lane around the lake blocked to traffic.</p>
      <h3>What should I do?</h3>
      <p>Some of the many events and stalls to watch out for include:</p>
      <p>
