      <h1>Humble Jose Mourinho won't take any credit but that was Dele Alli back to his best</h1>
      <h2>Dele Alli impressed for Tottenham as Jose Mourinho enjoyed a winning start against West Ham with a 3-2 victory at the London Stadium on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:45:04+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:45</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Dunn, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>He will not take any of the credit because he is so, so humble, of course.</p>
      <p>When a sprinkling of the away support acknowledged him in song long after the final whistle, he acknowledged it with mock sheepishness.</p>
      <p>That well-documented humility will prevent Jose Mourinho from suggesting he has had some sort of immediate, transformative effect on Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <p>And let’s face it, West Ham were - for three-quarters of this odd match - utterly dismal, with a goalkeeper who must have won some sort of competition.</p>
      <p>But as he pointed and shouted his approval towards Dele Alli in the celebratory wake of Spurs’ second, Mourinho would have been giving himself a familiar, mental pat on the back.</p>
      <p>In fact, a great big self-hug.</p>

      <p>Forget the fact the player has been in pretty decent nick over the past couple of months anyway, Mourinho’s one-liner asking him if he was Dele or Dele’s brother obviously hit a mark.</p>
      <p>And never mind that Dele’s brother, or mother, would have fancied his chances against Manuel Pellegrini’s lot, genius Jose is back.</p>
      <p>One quip and prime Dele returns, assisting in the opener for Son Heung-Min and then impudently pre-assisting in the Lucas Moura close-ranger that doubled Tottenham’s lead.</p>
      <p>Quite why West Ham and Pellegrini afforded him the freedom of the London Stadium for most of the afternoon is anybody’s guess.</p>
      <p>But the basic truth is that this was, arguably, one of Dele’s best performances of the season.</p>

      <p>This was Dele back to his cheeky best, back to his England standard, back to his roaming, adventurous, creative norm.</p>
      <p>Call it coincidence, if you like, but to not give Mourinho any sliver of credit for Dele’s contribution would be churlish.</p>
      <p>Just as it would not be to give him any credit for Tottenham’s first Premier League away win since January 20.</p>
      <p>Again, the caveat has to be that West Ham, for large swathes of the game, were insipid, half-committed and, overall, a tactical joke.</p>
      <p>But Mourinho had a plan - he always does - and it worked.</p>
      <p>Take Tottenham’s third goal. In the first half, it had been evident the often-maligned Serge Aurier had been given a licence to bomb forward from the right-back position whereas Ben Davies had been told to hold his station at left-back.</p>

      <p>Sure enough, early in the second half, Aurier careered into opposition territory again and sent over the cross from which Harry Kane, with a crushing inevitability, beat the truly hapless Roberto with his header.</p>
      <p>Not exactly a masterstroke from Mourinho but a ploy that paid off, as so many of his ploys used to, certainly back in the day.</p>
      <p>He will not have been happy that Michail Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna - courtesy of decent finishes and unacceptable penalty box freedom - were able to give the scoreline a semblance of respectability West Ham did not really deserve.</p>
      <p>There was, indeed, some late sloppiness that reminded everyone just how underwhelming Spurs have been this season.</p>
      <p>But this was pretty much the perfect start for Mourinho, allowing him to go through a fair chunk of his extensive, technical area repertoire.</p>
      <p>The finger-pointing, the low fist pumps, the hands-in-pockets pacing and an old, old favourite from his motivation manual.</p>
      <p>With 11 minutes of regulation time left, he withdrew Dele, for tactical reasons obviously but also enabling him to give one of those familiar, one-to-one public displays of affection.</p>
      <p>Just like the hanging humbly around at the end so the fans eventually feel pretty much compelled to chant your name, it is a well-used Jose trick.</p>
      <p>Brace yourself for a lot more of them.</p>
      <p>As the world knows, as Dele knows, it is not going to be dull.</p>
