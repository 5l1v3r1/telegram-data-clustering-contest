      <p>Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said the government is looking at the methodologies used by credit rating agencies in rating corporates.</p>
      <p>She also said the Narendra Modi government decided against joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership as the offer did not match India’s expectations and aspirations.</p>
      <p>Delivering the sixth G. Ramachandran Memorial Lecture organises by the Southern India Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Sitharaman said she had met some rating agencies to understand how they rate a company, its assets and how far it is in line with the happenings in the economy.</p>
      <p>The Finance Minister, without mentioning any names, said corporates have gone bust soon after getting AAA-rated, thereby making people wonder.</p>
      <p>She said a churn is happening in the way banks are assessing their asset quality and also the manner that credit ratings are done.</p>
      <p>According to Sitharaman, the government plans to further strengthen the powers of financial sector regulators like Reserve Bank of India, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India.</p>
      <p>Citing the reduction in corporate taxes, she said the government is fast responding to the needs of various sectors.</p>
