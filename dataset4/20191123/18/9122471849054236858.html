      <h1>Video: Fan At Northwestern-Minnesota Game Is Going Viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:15:59+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Northwestern plays a traditional style of football. It’s all about winning in the trenches, playing the field position game and winning the time of possession battle. Even when the Wildcats are at their best, it isn’t exactly the most exciting brand of football to watch.</p>
      <p>Pat Fitzgerald’s squad has had a horrible season so far, going 2-8. It’s looking like the Wildcats are going to drop another game to Minnesota on Saturday afternoon as the Golden Gophers have a 21-2 lead in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>As a result, Northwestern fans are starting to find ways to distract themselves from what’s going on in the actual game. One young Wildcats fan found a game of his own to take his mind off his team’s poor performance.</p>
      <p>ESPN caught a video of this young fan trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube as the game is happening live.</p>

      <p>That’s one way to try and distract one’s self during a blowout.</p>
      <p>This is one of many fans who’ve been caught engaging in other activities other than watching the game. Another <a href="https://thespun.com/news/florida-state-fan-going-viral-for-what-hes-doing-at-end-of-clemson-blowout">fan was caught reading a book</a> during Clemson’s blowout victory over Florida State last season.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, it’s best for fans to take their minds off the game – especially when it’s not the outcome fans were hoping for.</p>
