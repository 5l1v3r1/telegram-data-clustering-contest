      <h1>Kendall Jenner Opted for All Black on a New York Friday Night</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:09:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:09</time> by <a rel="author">Hilary Weaver</a></address>
      <p>Every New Yorker knows that wintertime (or late fall) in the city is just a sea of black coats. In a dirty, dirty city, black is never usually the wrong choice—though <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/09/anna-wintour-interview-outfit.html">Anna Wintour would disagree</a>. On Friday night, Kendall Jenner seemed to know the way of the New Yorker: She was dressed in an all-black ensemble.</p>
      <p>Per <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7716879/Kendall-Jenner-bundles-beneath-leather-coat-pal-Justine-Sky-head-night.html"><i>The Daily Mail</i>,</a> Jenner was visiting a home on the Upper West Side with her friend Justine Skye. Black trousers, a long black leather coat with a brown fur neckline, and black chunky boots had Jenner looking bundled and stylish and not at all like she was getting ready for a cozy night in with friends (according to <i>The Daily Mail,</i> she was). In photos, Skye trailed behind her in a gray sweatshirt, blue jacket, and eyeshadow to match.</p>
      <p>Skye, a singer and Brooklyn native, first got thrown into the Kardashian spotlight when Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott were still going strong. Skye and Scott <a href="https://okmagazine.com/photos/justine-skye-kylie-jenner-ending-friendship/">dated </a>before Kylie and Scott picked things up.</p>
      <p>“I mean we were friends like back in the day. I mean, like, this is about, like, four years ago I guess and then we weren’t,” she said on Breakfast Club in 2018,<a href="https://okmagazine.com/photos/justine-skye-kylie-jenner-ending-friendship/"> per </a><i><a href="https://okmagazine.com/photos/justine-skye-kylie-jenner-ending-friendship/">OK</a>. </i>She went on: “We speak – I mean we’re not as close as we once were and that’s probably obvious to the rest of the world.”</p>
      <p>But Kendall and Justine seem to hit it off just fine. In August, they went on a girls' trip to Jamaica with Hailey Bieber, where they took plenty of Instagram-worthy photos out in the wild—or by man-made bodies of water.</p>
