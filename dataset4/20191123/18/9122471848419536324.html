      <h1>Chase Young, Micah Parsons Got Into It At Halftime Of Ohio State vs. Penn State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:46:50+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>About an hour before kickoff at Saturday’s Ohio State vs. Penn State matchup, players on both sides were seen jawing at midfield in anticipation of the contest. It doesn’t look like they’ve calmed down after one half of football.</p>
      <p>FOX just aired video of Ohio State’s Chase Young and Penn State’s Micah Parsons going back-and-forth as the two teams headed to the tunnel for halftime. It looks like it was shut down before it got physical.</p>
      <p>Young <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/ohio-state-buckeyes/video-chase-young-ties-ohio-state-sack-record-penn-state">has been a monster for Ohio State thus far</a>. The Buckeyes are shutting out the Nittany Lions to the tune of a 14-0 score.</p>
      <p>Here’s footage, via Eleven Warriors:</p>

      <p>Ohio State running back J.K. Dobbins has rushed for 89 yards and scored twice. Buckeyes quarterback Justin Fields fumbled on the goal line too, so the score could be worse if you’re a Nittany Lions fan.</p>
      <p>Penn State quarterback Sean Clifford is just 8-of-15 for 53 yards. He’ll need to perform better in the second half if the Nittany Lions are to stage a comeback.</p>
      <p>The second half is about to begin. Ohio State can win the Big Ten East with another solid half of football.</p>
