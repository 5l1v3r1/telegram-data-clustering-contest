      <p>Defender Batth's 55th-minute equaliser spared new manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/michael-oneill/"><b>Michael O'Neill</b></a> defeat in his first home league game in charge of the Potters.</p>
      <p>And Diouf's late goal sunk the Latics, who had been on course for what would have been only their second win in 30 away matches.</p>
      <p>Earlier Wigan skipper <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sam-morsy/"><b>Sam Morsy</b></a>'s first league goal for two years gave the visitors a welcome 39th-minute lead and hope of ending their four-game winless run.</p>
      <p>The Egypt midfielder fired home after a howler from Stoke keeper <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jack-butland/"><b>Jack Butland</b></a> just before the break.</p>
      <p>The former England international's attempted clearance smashed into team-mate <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tom-edwards/"><b>Tom Edwards</b></a> and Morsy mopped up from the mistake.</p>
      <p>But Batth poked home from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/james-mclean/"><b>James McLean</b></a>'s free-kick and then Diouf pounced at the death to complete a remarkable turnaround.</p>
      <p>The hosts started the brighter with Wigan keeper <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/david-marshall/"><b>David Marshall</b></a> forced to produce a smart save to deny the lively McLean after only three minutes.</p>
      <p>And less than a minute later McLean turned provider with an inch-perfect cross for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nick-powell/"><b>Nick Powell</b></a> but the midfielder frustratingly headed against the bar.</p>
      <p>Winger <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tom-ince/"><b>Tom Ince</b></a> had a glorious chance to put the hosts ahead in the seventh minute, but his composure let him down as he blazed over from the edge of the box.</p>
      <p>The visitors finally came to life on the quarter-hour mark when <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jamal-lowe/"><b>Jamal Lowe</b></a> whipped a dangerous ball across the face of goal and the recalled <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gavin-massey/"><b>Gavin Massey</b></a>, one of four changes for the visitors, came within inches of scoring.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lewis-macleod/"><b>Lewis MacLeod</b></a> burst forward and had a shot charged down on the edge of the area and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/paul-cook/"><b>Paul Cook</b></a>'s side should have taken the lead through leading scorer <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/chey-dunkley/"><b>Chey Dunkley</b></a>, but the unmarked centre-back headed agonisingly wide from point-blank range from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/charlie-mulgrew/"><b>Charlie Mulgrew</b></a>'s corner.</p>
      <p>Scottland shot-stopper Marshall had to be alert to thwart <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/stephen-ward/"><b>Stephen Ward</b></a> just after the half-hour as the home side pushed for the opener.</p>
      <p>But it was at the other end of the pitch that the breakthrough came thanks to Butland's error as Morsy gladly fired into an open net.</p>
      <p>Stoke started brightly at the beginning of the second half and McLean nearly scored a brilliant solo goal.</p>
      <p>His bursting run saw him beat four defenders, but defender <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/antonee-robinson/"><b>Antonee Robinson</b></a> managed to get in a vital block as McLean pulled the trigger in the area.</p>
      <p>The equaliser then came through Batth, as McLean won a free-kick and crossed for the defender to poke home at the near post.</p>
      <p>Striker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lee-gregory/"><b>Lee Gregory</b></a> had a chance to put the hosts ahead but he fired over from close range from Powell's pass.</p>
      <p>Substitute <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kieffer-moore/"><b>Kieffer Moore</b></a> fired straight at Butland from distance while Marshall saved well from Ince in a frantic finish.</p>
      <p>Substitute Diouf won it when he bundled in from close range to give O'Neill a second successive victory since taking charge.</p>
