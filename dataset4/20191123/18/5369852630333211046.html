      <p>THERE ARE A lot of rugby players who earn the right to be described as ‘a footballer’.</p>
      <p>But with Finn Russell producing skill like this, we’ll either have to reclassify a heap of them or give the Scot a moniker all of his own.</p>
      <p>There was an advantage coming and Russell not only rolled the dice in search of a try, he deftly rolled the oval ball clean through Rory Scannell’s legs.</p>

      <p>The Champions Cup clash at Thomond Park was already entertaining enough without Russell’s astounding extra flourish.</p>
      <p>There was no following up that quality, but the match delivered plenty more drama as the sides played out a tense 21-21 draw.</p>
