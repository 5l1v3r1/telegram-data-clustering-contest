      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/pierre-emerick-aubameyang/">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> insists the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> squad is as disappointed as the club’s fans after the draw at home to Southampton.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a>’s Arsenal were booed off following an underwhelming 2-2 draw against relegation-battlers Southampton on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have endured a shocking run and went behind at the Emirates after Danny Ings caught Arsenal cold from a free-kick and fired past Bernd Leno.</p>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/alexandre-lacazette/">Alexandre Lacazette</a> equalised for Arsenal ten minutes later but the Saints found themselves behind again in the second-half when James Ward-Prowse scored on the rebound from a penalty.</p>
      <p>In-form striker Lacazette rescued a point for the hosts with an extra-time goal but the draw will do little to appease a large section of Arsenal fans who want Emery sacked.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the 2-2 draw, Aubameyang said: ‘I don’t know [if the criticism is fair at the moment], but the team is disappointed like the fans are as well.</p>

      <p>‘When we are playing, we are the first to be disappointed when it doesn’t work. We will try to keep fighting. I think we have the quality to come back and we have to fight.</p>
      <p>‘We knew that it wasn’t going to be easy because we know that when they play away, they feel comfortable on the ball and they are strong.</p>
      <p>‘We expected them to play like this. We are really disappointed.’</p>

      <p>Asked to pinpoint the reason for Arsenal’s struggles, Aubameyang said: ‘I don’t know. Sincerely, I don’t know.</p>
      <p>‘I think everybody has to try to ask themselves that, and what they can change, what they can give more of.</p>
      <p>‘Everybody has to do this, me first. I will try to work hard and to get back to winning ways.’</p>
      <p>Pressed on when he expects Arsenal to improve, the forward added: ‘Hopefully as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>‘We have a game on Thursday and we will start from this game to try to turn things around.</p>

      <p>‘In this case, it’s really not easy for everybody but we are men and we have to carry on to try to sort it out. We are a group and we can find a solution internally. That’s what we are going to do.’</p>
