      <p>Arsenal needed an Alexandre Lacazette stoppage-time goal to get a 2-2 draw at the end of an unconvincing performance against struggling Southampton.</p>
      <p>Southampton appeared to be coasting to a first Premier League victory in eight games through a James Ward-Prowse goal on his 250th appearance for Southampton.</p>
      <p>This was after Lacazette had equalized to cancel Danny Ing’s effort in the 8th minute to make it one all.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman again grabbed a last-gasp leveller (90+6) that was met by underwhelming celebrations in the home end after their team had been second best for large periods as the pressure intensifies on boss Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>Relegation-threatened Saints, who registered 21 shots on goal, should have wrapped the points up in injury time but substitute Moussa Djenepo wasted two huge opportunities leaving Ralph Hasenhuttl’s men without a win in the Premier League in their last eight matches.</p>
