      <p><b>Legit.ng</b> earlier reported that <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1278367-west-ham-tottenham-jose-mourinho-begins-spurs-reign-3-2-win.html">Jose Mourinho got his reign as Tottenham Hotspur head coach on a winning note</a> following his side's 3-2 win over West Ham United at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese took over at the club earlier this week after the sack of former handler Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>A goal each from Lucas Moura, Harry Kane, and Son Heung-min sealed the new manager's first win on the road.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, two second-half goals from Michail Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna failed to save them from losing the game.</p>
