        <b>Radio presenter Joe Duffy has backed calls for an RTÉ building to be renamed in honour of the late Gay Byrne.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Duffy, who was a close friend of Byrne, said he would decorate the sign himself.</p>
      <p>Duffy, quoted in the <i>Irish Daily Star</i>, said: "We've a building in RTÉ, a new building that's called a stage 7, I think, I think absolutely it should be renamed the Gay Byrne Building.</p>
      <p>"Definitely, absolutely, totally, completely, 100 percent. I'll paint the sign myself. It's stage 7 we've rechristened it The Gay Byrne memorial building. I'll paint the sign. Seriously."</p>
      <p>The Liveline presenters comments came after Dublin Councillor Mannox Flynn said RTÉ should rename their Montrose campus after Byrne.</p>
      <p>Flynn said: “There is no obstacle to RTÉ doing this right away. I think there would be full support from the public. I’ve spoken to RTÉ staff and they support the idea too.</p>
      <p>“We can’t wait 20 years for this either like we did for a statue to Luke Kelly.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/westlife-hailed-gay-byrne-grandad-ireland-late-late-appearance-343969"><i>Westlife</i></a> paid tribute to Byrne during an appearance on The Late Late Show last night.</p>
      <p>Mark Feehily said: "The one standout moment for me was when we did a TV special at Christmas time. I really wasn't expecting it but he brought up the coming out issue, and said it's fantastic how you can be who you want to be, and be yourself in this country and everyone supports you.</p>
      <p>"I don’t know why, but I didn’t expect him to bring it up, but it was really lovely for him to acknowledge it for me.</p>
      <p>"He was like the grandad of Ireland and so he spoke for a certain generation.</p>
      <p>"It was very nice. He didn’t have to bring it up but it’s like he wanted to, and he wanted to show that he was very supportive."</p>
