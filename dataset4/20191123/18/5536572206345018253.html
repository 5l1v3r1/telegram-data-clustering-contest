      <h1>Floyd Mayweather Reportedly Seeking 2 Fights In 2020, Including MMA Crossover</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:42:01+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:42</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Is Floyd Mayweather seriously thinking about crossing over into MMA? If he wants to make the most money he has ever made for one single fight, then he surely might do that.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the 50-0 boxer stated his willingness to retire from the sport to focus on his health after several boxers saw their lives end with injuries from the ring, but would soon change his mind and un-retire and announce that he would fight in 2020.</p>
      <p>The undefeated boxer reportedly plans to fight twice in 2020, with a rematch against Manny Pacquiao and another crossover bout against a UFC opponent on his wishlist.</p>
      <p>Via <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/23/floyd-mayweather-2-fights-2020-ufc-crossover/">TMZ</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Floyd Mayweather doesn’t want to be a 1-and-done in 2020 — our sources tell us he’s targeting TWO fights next year … one against a pro-boxer and another against a UFC star.<br/><br/>Nothing is set in stone yet … it’s all being worked out and the situation is very fluid. But, for now, we’re being told one name that’s being seriously considered is Manny Pacquiao.<br/><br/>Floyd has been interested in a rematch for years and he feels the time is right — especially with Manny being healthy and coming off a great victory over Keith Thurman.<br/><br/>It’s also worth noting that Manny is no longer repped by Bob Arum and is now a part of Al Haymon‘s promotion. Hayman famously works closely with Mayweather.<br/><br/>As for the UFC component, we’re told Floyd wants another boxing match with a UFC star, preferably someone who has impressed with stand-up striking skills.<br/><br/>Floyd has already teased a UFC crossover after hanging with Dana White at the Clippers game on Nov. 20 … unclear if they spoke about potential opponents.”</blockquote>
      <p>The 42-year-old has an estimated net worth was $285 million as of July 2018, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/floyd-mayweather/#349d0ee32e8a">Forbes</a>.</p>
