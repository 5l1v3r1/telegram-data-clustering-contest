      <p>Pirates Friday night raided Opurudiegbene community in Burutu council area of Delta State, carting away generators, household appliances and an unspecified amount of cash.</p>
      <p>It was learnt that three children are missing following the attack. A source said sporadic shooting caused fear in the community as pirates robbed shop owners and other residents of the coastal community.</p>
      <p>According to a victim, Mr. Philip Amatu, the attackers are youngsters between ages 17 years and 24 years. “They came in a speed boat with sophisticated weapons and shot sporadically into the air to scare us. We ran for our lives. We know some of them and their villages.</p>

      <p>“They raped women, stole money from various shop owners. Electronic gadgets and generating sets were carted away too. We are still looking for three children after the raid. Till now, their mothers are crying. One could not tell whether they drowned or were taken away. We slept in the forest as others ran to neighbouring villages through the bush path for safety,” he said. Delta Police Commissioner, Mr. Adeyinka Adeleke, said no complaint of pirates attack has been lodged, adding that his men on ground have not informed him.</p>
      <p>Another prominent leader of the community, Chief Ezoukumor Michael, expressed worry over the menace of sea pirates in Burutu L.G.A. He said the villagers informed him from their hideout during the raid. He urged on state government not to play politics with security issues in Burutu riverine communities and other parts of the state.</p>
