        <b>A man has been jailed after he threatened to burn down a nightclub because it didn't sell Red Bull.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Michael Day, 38, screamed: "I'm going to burn every last one of you."</p>
      <p>Shush nightclub in Wantage, Oxfordshire, had to be evacuated due to the incident.</p>
      <p>Day was set to stand trial for the incident but later admitted to attempted arson and two counts of making threats to kill.</p>
      <p>He flew into a rage after bar staff had served him an alternative drink, as they didn't sell Red Bull, on April 28, heard Oxford Crown Court.</p>
      <p>Day was thrown out of the club after becoming aggressive.</p>
      <p>He went home before returning to the club, where CCTV footage showed him armed with a 20-litre white plastic container party filled with petrol.</p>
      <p>He was seen throwing it towards the door and launching himself in the path of the door staff.</p>
      <p>Petrol was spilt on the ground and on staff members' clothing before Day flicked a lighter and screamed death threats, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Day had a cigarette in his mouth at the time and also shouted racist abuse towards one worker and threatened to burn the nightclub down.</p>
      <p>As the smell of the fumes wafted inside the club, all 177 punters had to be evacuated.</p>
      <p>After being arrested, Day told police he had drank up to seven bottles of Corona and didn't really intend to start a fire, simply aiming to 'scare people'.</p>
      <p>Day's barrister said he couldn't remember the incident.</p>
      <p>Judge Maria Lamb jailed him for five years and two months over the "terrifying" incident.</p>
