      <p>Crack on with the Christmas prep with this tempting cake from telly chef Phil Vickery.</p>
      <p>He prefers the texture of the gluten-free version and, for best results, soaks the fruit in the whisky and lemon juice ­overnight.</p>
      <p>And Phil's ­gluten-free bread recipe is a winter winner, too.</p>
      <h3>Rich Fruit Christmas cake</h3>
      <p>1. Place the dried fruit and mixed peel in a pan, add the whisky and the lemon juice and zest and bring up to the boil. Take the pan off the heat, cover and leave to soak overnight.</p>
      <p>2. Preheat the oven to 150°C/gas mark 2. Oil and line the base and sides of a 6–8cm deep round or square 18cm cake tin with a double layer of baking parchment, including a tall collar sticking up.</p>

      <p>3. Sift the flour, baking powder, xanthan gum and spices together. Cream the butter and sugar together until fluffy and light. Gradually add the eggs and flour, alternately, and then add the ground almonds.</p>
      <p>4. Stir in the milk and mix in the dried fruit mixture, almonds and cherries. Finally, stir in the treacle and honey and give the whole cake mix a thoroughly good stir.</p>
      <p>5. Spoon the mixture into the tin, level, and bake for about 90 minutes to two hours or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin.</p>
      <p>6. To decorate, brush the surface of the cake with half the warmed jam. Arrange or pile a selection of glacé fruits and nuts over the top and brush over a second layer of jam to glaze.</p>
      <p>6 Now all you need is a big bow to put round the sides!</p>
      <p>Fancy a traditional topping? I like the glacé fruit and nut topping as it’s so quick and easy! But if you prefer you can decorate it in the traditional way instead with a layer of marzipan topped with some white icing of your choice.</p>
      <p><b>TO STORE:</b> The undecorated cake will keep for up to one month, tightly wrapped in foil in an airtight container.</p>
      <p><b>TO FREEZE:</b> When cold, remove the cake from the tin, wrap in greaseproof paper and two thick layers of foil and freeze in an airtight container. Defrost for three to four hours and when defrosted, decorate as above.</p>
      <h3>Gluten-Free Bread Mix</h3>
      <p>Makes: 1.3kg</p>
      <p>Preparation: 5 minutes</p>
      <ul>
        <li>400g soya flour</li>
        <li>200g tapioca flour</li>
        <li>400g potato flour</li>
        <li> 300g cornflour</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mix all the flours together very thoroughly or put into a food processor and pulse until mixed. Store in an airtight container.</p>
