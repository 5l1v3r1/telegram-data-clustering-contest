      <h1>Olympic doping ban looms for Russia after WADA panel ruling</h1>

      <p>MontrealÂ  - The prospect of <b>Russia</b> being banned from next year's <b>Tokyo Olympics</b> moved a step closer as the<b> World Anti-Doping Agency</b> (WADA) recommended the country's drug-testing authority be declared non-compliant, with charges racking up against Russia and the clock ticking ahead of next July's Games.</p>
      <p>WADA said in Canada overnight Friday its Compliance Review Committee (CRC) recommended the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) be suspended again when the global watchdog meets in Paris on December 9.</p>
      <p>If WADA chiefs adopt the recommendation, Russia faces severe sanctions including a possible ban from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.</p>
      <p>Russia's anti-doping chief Yury Ganus described the ruling as fair and expected.</p>
      <p>"The compliance decision was contingent on two demands. These were met formally but not properly," Ganus said.</p>
      <p>The CRC issued its recommendation after asking Russia to explain "inconsistencies" in laboratory data handed over by Moscow to WADA investigators in January.</p>
      <p>Full disclosure of data from the Moscow laboratory was a key condition of Russia's controversial reinstatement by WADA in September 2018.</p>
      <p>RUSADA had been suspended over revelations of a vast, state-backed doping regime which including a systematic conspiracy to switch tainted samples at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.</p>
      <p>The United States Anti-Doping Agency, which was sharply critical of WADA's decision to lift its suspension and reinstate RUSADA, called for a lengthy ban following Friday's announcement.</p>
      <p>"Anything less than a four-year sanction for this critical violation that includes aggravating circumstances following years of denial and deceit would be another injustice in a long line of many for clean athletes," USADA chief executive Travis Tygart said in emailed comments to AFP.</p>
      <p>Friday's development is the latest twist to a saga which exploded in 2015, when an independent WADA commission investigating allegations of Russian doping said it had found evidence of a vast state-supported conspiracy stretching back years.</p>
      <p>A 2016 report by WADA investigator Richard McLaren said more than 1,000 Russian competitors across multiple sports had benefited from the scheme between 2011 and 2015.</p>
      <p>In an interview with AFP last month, RUSADA's chief Ganus appeared resigned to Russia being handed an Olympic ban, accusing unidentified Moscow authorities of handing over falsified lab data to WADA.</p>
      <p>"Russia's Olympic squad will be prevented from participating fully in the Olympic Games in Tokyo.... I think that this will also happen at the (Winter Olympic) Games in China," Ganus told AFP.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Ganus said the suspension proposal did not reflect any shortcoming on the part of the agency.</p>
      <p>It was not due to "the quality of RUSADA's work," he said, adding: "It's a purely technical decision... conditions were not met whose implementation was not up to us."</p>
      <p>Ganus said he expected a range of other penalties too, including restrictions on holding international tournaments in Russia, exclusion of Russians from international sports federations and fines.</p>
      <p>Ganus insisted RUSADA officials had not been responsible for falsifying the data, insisting his staff "had nothing to do with the database and its transfer."</p>
      <p>Russian Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov later denied the data had been tampered with, stating "nothing was removed" before the cache of information was handed over.</p>
      <p>Friday's announcement by WADA came as World Athletics (formerly IAAF), the governing body for track and field, abruptly halted Russia's reinstatement process into the sport.</p>
      <p>The World Athletics decision was taken after the president of the Russian athletics federation (RUSAF), Dmitry Shlyakhtin, and other senior officials were suspended on Thursday for "serious breaches" of anti-doping rules.</p>
      <p>These charges included provision to an athlete of false explanations and forged documents to explain missed doping tests.</p>
      <p>Shlyakhtin resigned on Saturday and Yulia Tarasenko was appointed as interim president of Russia's athletics body.</p>
      <p>Tarasenko, the RUSAF sports director and head of the athletics federation of St. Petersburg, immediately sought to reassure Russian athletes she would fight their corner.</p>
      <p>"We're not in a very joyful mood, the situation is very difficult in the federation, but we think there is a chance to fight for the federation," she said.</p>
      <p>"We represent athletes and they should not suffer," the new acting president Tarasenko told journalists.</p>
