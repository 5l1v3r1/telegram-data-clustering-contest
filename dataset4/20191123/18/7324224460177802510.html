      <p>Rangers, with just one league win to their name, almost got off to the perfect start with Paul Bignot firing over the bar.</p>
      <p>However, Hyde hit the hosts on the break in the second minute lead when Dan Turner played through Chris Sharp who kept his composure to slide home the opener.</p>
      <p>The Boro deserved their 22nd minute equaliser with Jack Sherratt firing home before the hosts continued to probe.</p>
      <p>Straight after the break Hyde regained the lead with a wonder striker by Paddy Lane finding the top corner with his effort.</p>
      <p>Rangers probed for a leveller and substitute Jed Davies put his effort just wide in search for an equaliser.</p>
      <p>However, any hope ended in the 79th minute when Liam Tongue fired his free-kick into the net to seal the points.</p>
