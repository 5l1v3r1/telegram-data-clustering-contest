      <h1>Leigh Griffiths makes Celtic fan's day as he gifts jersey to delighted youngster</h1>
      <h2>The striker made his return to first team football and left one supporter thrilled.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:32:43+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:32</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>You might think <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leigh-griffiths">Leigh Griffiths</a> would have been the happiest man inside Celtic Park after returning to the first team.</p>
      <p>He hasn't played since August but made a second half appearance in the 4-0 thumping of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/livingston-fc">Livingston.</a></p>
      <p>The smile could be seen on his face as he entered the field but he made one young fan's day at the end of the game.</p>
      <p>Griffiths made his way over to the stand and took his shirt off to hand it to the shellshocked youngster.</p>

      <p>The brilliant pictures from the scene show the young supporter alongside his dad John with a huge smile on his face as he posed with the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> shirt.</p>
      <p>Griffiths came off the bench to a rapturous reception and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> was full of praise for him.</p>
      <p>He said: "That'll do him (Griffiths) the world of good. He almost scored and he's sniffing out chances, he's looking more and more like himself.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old played for an hour against Stenhousemuir for the reserves in midweek.</p>
      <p>He grabbed a double and will now look to get back on the goal trail for the first team.</p>
