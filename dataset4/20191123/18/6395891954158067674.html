      <p><b>NEW HAVEN, Conn.Â (AP)</b> - A Canadian man accused of abducting his toddler son in Toronto in 1987 and eluding authorities for three decades is due back in a U.S. court for a preliminary extradition hearing.</p>
      <p>Allan Mann Jr. is scheduled to appear before a federal judge in New Haven, Connecticut, on Monday on a request by Canadian officials for the U.S. to continue detaining Mann until extradition papers are completed.</p>
      <p>Mann was sentenced this month to 18 months in prison for illegally obtaining U.S. government housing and medical benefits while on the lam with his son.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Mann kidnapped his son during a court-ordered visitation. Law enforcement officials found him in Vernon, Connecticut, last year. An abduction charge is pending in Toronto.</p>
      <p>Mann's son was reunited with his mother after his father's arrest.</p>
