      <p>Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, the commander of U.S. Central Command, is wary of another attack from Iran in the Gulf, <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/23/very-possible-iran-will-attack-again-top-us-general-says/"><i>Foreign Policy</i> reports</a>.</p>
      <p>"I think the strike on Saudi Aramco in September is pretty indicative of a nation that is behaving irresponsibly," McKenzie <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/23/very-possible-iran-will-attack-again-top-us-general-says/">said</a>.

One official <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/23/very-possible-iran-will-attack-again-top-us-general-says/">told <i>Foreign Policy</i></a> that they're particularly focused on potential threats on desalination plants in the arid Gulf region. An attack on the plants would put the region's primary source of drinking water at risk, which <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/23/very-possible-iran-will-attack-again-top-us-general-says/">could spur</a> a humanitarian crisis.
