      <p><b>LONDONÂ (AP)</b> - Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is defending his decision to remain neutral in a possible future referendum on Britain's membership in the European Union.</p>
      <p>Corbyn said Saturday that he plans to be an "honest broker" in a Brexit referendum rather than urge voters to remain in the EU or leave under terms of a new deal he would negotiate if he becomes prime minister after the Dec. 12 election.</p>
      <p>He said at a campaign event in Sheffield that "my role as the Labour prime minister would be to ensure that is carried out in a fair way ... and that I will carry out the result of that referendum."</p>
      <p>Corbyn announced Friday night he would be neutral, a position assailed Saturday by political rivals on both sides of the Brexit divide.</p>
      <p>He had been repeatedly challenged by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to clarify his Brexit plan. Labour's position is more complex than the unabashedly pro-Brexit policy espoused by Johnson and his Conservatives, who seek to win parliamentary approval for the deal already negotiated in order to leave the EU by Jan. 31.</p>
      <p>Corbyn says if he comes to power, Labour will negotiate a new deal with EU officials, then put that new deal to voters, who can choose between endorsing it or staying inside the 28-nation EU bloc. He says he plans to let voters decide the proposed referendum without him taking a position as prime minister.</p>
      <p>That view was ridiculed on the campaign trail Saturday.</p>
      <p>Liberal Democratic leader Jo Swinson called it a total abdication of the prime minister's responsibility. Her party has vowed to halt Brexit by revoking Article 50, which triggered Britain's withdrawal process.</p>
      <p>Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who advocates an immediate, final break with the EU, said the Labour Party is "bombing" with voters because of Corbyn's vague position.</p>
      <p>Johnson pushed for Britain to hold the December election, which is taking place more than two years early, in hopes of winning a majority and breaking Britain's political impasse over Brexit. All 650 seats in the House of Commons are up for grabs.</p>
