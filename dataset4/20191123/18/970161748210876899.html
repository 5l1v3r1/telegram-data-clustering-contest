      <p>Taking to Instagram, the proud mum shared a picture of her brood, who could be seen all wrapped up as they played with two <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dogs/">dogs</a>.</p>
      <p>In the caption, the former glamour model wrote: ‘Saturdays with my girls, wearing their own range @princessandbunny.co.uk coats &amp; hats.’</p>

      <p>Katie’s post comes just one day after the mum-of-five took aim at Emily Atack after the actress made a remark about Katie’s sex life on I’m A celebrity’s sister show.</p>
      <p>The Inbetweeners star joked that presenters Joel Dommett and Adam Thomas needed to get tested for diseases after plunging into the same pool Katie and peter Andre first kissed in.</p>
      <p>And this didn’t sit right with the reality star, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/katie-price-slams-emily-atack-heated-rant-im-celebrity-stars-sti-jibe-11203901/">who shared a video on Instagram hitting back at the quip.</a></p>
      <p>Threatening to come to the jungle herself, the 41-year-old spat at the camera: ‘So Emily Atack, you think it’s clever do you to slag me off? Who are you anyway?’</p>

      <p>Dressed in a camo print outfit with a rucksack by her side she continued: ‘Looks like I’m coming for you.</p>
      <p>‘Because if you’ve got something to say don’t say it behind my back on telly say it to me. Because all the men you’ve been with don’t have good things to say about you.’</p>
