      <h1>Result: Kilmarnock ease past Hearts</h1>
      <h2>A thrilling opening 15 minutes from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/kilmarnock/"><b>Kilmarnock</b></a> handed them a deserved 3-0 over struggling <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/hearts/"><b>Hearts</b></a> in the Ladbrokes Premiership.</h2>

      <p>If this was <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/austin-macphee/"><b>Austin MacPhee</b></a>'s audition for the permanent managerial role at Hearts then he failed miserably.</p>
      <p>Whilst undeniably being a good coach, his decision to start Aidy White in a left-midfield role proved disastrous as Kilmarnock raced to a three-goal lead within 15 minutes.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/chris-burke/"><b>Chris Burke</b></a> rolled back the years with a virtuoso performance that wielded two goals and an assist. The 35 year-old winger opened the scoring on nine minutes when he fired high past <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joel-pereira/"><b>Joel Pereira</b></a> after <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mohamed-el-makrini/"><b>Mohamed El Makrini</b></a>'s well-timed pass.</p>
      <p>The outstanding Burke went from scorer to provider on 13 minutes when he produced a stunning pin-point cross for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/eamonn-brophy/"><b>Eamonn Brophy</b></a> to power a header past Periera.</p>
      <p>All three of Kilmarnock's early goals came down their right-hand side as youngster <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/aaron-hickey/"><b>Aaron Hickey</b></a> endured a terrible afternoon but with little support from the experienced White.</p>
      <p>The home side's third goal came directly from a Hearts corner as Killie counter-attacked at great pace before Burke weaved past Michael Smith and fired past Manchester United loanee Periera.</p>
      <p>It was a difficult watch for the travelling support as Hearts failed to respond to going three goals down and Burke continued to cause havoc, forcing Pereira into a comfortable save on 40 minutes.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/steven-naismith/"><b>Steven Naismith</b></a>, usually the influential heartbeat of this Hearts side when fit, struggled to make an impact after his goalscoring exploits for Scotland during the week.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, Hickey was replaced at the interval by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jake-mulraney/"><b>Jake Mulraney</b></a> as MacPhee tinkered with his formation to little effect.</p>
      <p>The visitors improved slightly immediately after half-time and had their best opportunities of the encounter through <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/clevid-dikamona/"><b>Clevid Dikamona</b></a>. From two consecutive corners, the towering French defender went agonisingly close with headers.</p>
      <p>Kilmarnock were comfortable throughout the second half as Hearts lacked a cutting edge. <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gary-dicker/"><b>Gary Dicker</b></a> was a colossus for Kilmarnock with the captain deployed in his familiar central midfield role after deputising at centre half recently due to a defensive crisis.</p>
      <p>The hosts almost capped a perfect afternoon with a stunning team goal on 87 minutes. <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alan-power/"><b>Alan Power</b></a> clipped a lovely ball through to El Makirini who nonchalantly flicked the ball into the path of the onrushing <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/stephen-odonnell/"><b>Stephen O'Donnell</b></a> and his goal bound half-volley was tipped over by Periera.</p>
