      <h1>Cyrname upsets the odds with landmark victory over Altior at Ascot</h1>

        <i>• Challenger wins by two and a quarter lengths in remorseless run <br/>• Result ends Altior’s unbeaten record in jump races</i>
      </p>
      <p>Altior’s unbeaten record in jump races is no more, left behind in the Berkshire mud as the terrier-like chaser finally came up against a horse he was unable to pass. It has evidently taken punters time to warm up to Cyrname, who has not started favourite since this day a year ago, but no one can quibble about his talent in the wake of victory in this keenly anticipated clash, six months in the hyping.</p>
      <p>All the portents seemed to favour Altior, heavily backed down to a starting price of 1-3, having been twice those odds in the morning. His trainer, Nicky Henderson, continued his excellent recent form by winning the first two races here. “Of course,” he noted in a cheery aside, “I won the first two races on Friday as well, and then the wheels came off...”</p>
      <p>The fear for Cyrname fans was that this free-going frontrunner would simply set things up for his more famous rival, whose superior pace would allow him to cruise alongside in the straight. And the challenger, allowed to start at the almost insulting odds of 5-2, did not improve his prospects by bashing through the fourth fence.</p>
      <p>But two miles in, at about the point where Altior expects to find the winning post, the mood began to change. Cyrname was bowling along remorselessly while Nico de Boinville started to niggle at his mount in behind him. In the end Altior never landed a blow and was beaten by two and a quarter lengths, a victory for the handicapper whose decision to rate Cyrname 1lb above had attracted derision from some.</p>
      <p>It would be easy enough to conclude that Altior, winner of 10 Grade Ones when racing over two miles, was simply not the same force over the extra five furlongs he faced here. But it might be that fitness decided the issue at this early stage of the season. Paul Nicholls did a perfect job of preparing Cyrname, who evidently impressed in a gallop at Wincanton a fortnight ago. Altior finished so tired that De Boinville dismounted before reaching the spot marked for the runner-up and the nine-year-old will surely be sharper next time.</p>
      <p>When will that next time be? “I have absolutely no idea,” Henderson said, but it would now be a very brave decision to step up another three furlongs for the King George on Boxing Day, where brave little Altior would be in among a pack of burly stayers. Stamina might not have been the issue here but there was no sign that the extra distance was a help to him.</p>
      <p>Cyrname, on the other hand, was committed to the King George by a jubilant, vindicated Nicholls, who nevertheless made time to talk up the second horse. “Altior’s been amazing for the game, such a brilliant horse,” said the Somerset trainer. “They all get beat some time, as Big Buck’s did. We just went out there to do our best on the day in the right race. They’re two very special horses.”</p>
      <p>This was another big moment for 21-year-old Harry Cobden. Opinion is divided as to whether he or Cyrname was more in control of the pace set but it looked a coolly judged ride by the jockey. He will surely be aboard Cyrname at Kempton, even though that will mean deserting Clan Des Obeaux, on whom he won last year’s King George.</p>
      <p>The biggest danger to both will be Lostintranslation, who had his own coming-of-age moment in landing Saturday’s Betfair Chase at Haydock, when his superb jumping carried him alongside Bristol De Mai rather earlier than Robbie Power really wanted. “Its just effortless to him,” Power said. “He’s just proven today he’s a dour stayer as well.”</p>
