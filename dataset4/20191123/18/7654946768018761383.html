      <h1>Prince Charles ‘will be furious’ at Prince Andrew over Epstein ties: insiders</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:31:30+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:31</time> by <a rel="author">Isabel Vincent</a></address>
      <p>A “furious” Prince Charles is set to read his younger brother “the riot act” this weekend over Prince Andrew’s association with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, royal watchers say.</p>
      <p>Charles returned to London from a state visit to New Zealand Friday where he ducked reporters’ questions about <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/prince-andrew-kicked-out-of-buckingham-palace-over-jeffrey-epstein-scandal/">Andrew’s disastrous BBC interview</a> in which he showed little sympathy for Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking victims. One of those women has accused Andrew of having sex with her three times when she was 17.</p>
      <p>“Charles will be furious that his trip to New Zealand has been completely overshadowed,” said Tom Bower, author of “Rebel Prince,” a biography of Prince Charles, in an interview with the Daily Mail.  “The one thing Charles is determined to do is inherit the crown and he won’t let anyone get in the way.”</p>
      <p>Following his <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-says-he-couldnt-sweat-in-attempt-to-debunk-epstein-accusers-claim/">“car crash” interview</a>, Queen Elizabeth II stripped her third son of his salary and royal duties. The harsh measures were taken in consultation with Prince Charles, royal watchers said. The heir to the throne also stepped in to prevent his brother from traveling on a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/prince-andrew-stepping-down-from-pitchpalace-charity-initiative-report/">charity junket</a> to Bahrain this week.</p>
      <p>To make matters worse, last week, Prince Andrew also invited his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, to Buckingham Palace in a move that royal watchers said was in poor taste since she is widely believed to have convinced him to do the televised interview that has resulted in the loss of his patronage to numerous UK charities and is damaging the reputation of the royal family.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure she [Fergie] will have been instrumental in encouraging Andrew to do that BBC interview,” Bower said. “She should never be allowed back into Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure Charles … will sit Andrew down and read him the riot act,” Phil Dampier, author of several books on the royal family, told the Daily Mail.</p>
