      <p>Following a two-week international break which saw the conclusion of the Euro 2020 qualifiers, Serie A action resumed this weekend. And champions <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/juventus">Juventus</a> started without <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/cristiano-ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> on their visit to the Stadio Atleti Azzurri d'Italia.</p>
      <p>Paulo Dybala went close for the Bianconeri from a free-kick before Atalanta were awarded a penalty in the 16th minute. But the opportunity went begging for the hosts as Musa Barrow's spot-kick found the woodwork, much to the relief of the Juve custodian Wojciech Szczesny.</p>
      <p>Juventus continued to have the better of the scoring opportunities but neither team managed to find the back of the net as half-time beckoned.</p>
      <p>The second half started on a positive note for the home side as Robin Gosens headed home to open the scoring. Jolted into action, Juve sought an immediate response and their efforts bore fruit when their Argentine striker Gonzalo Higuain restored parity 20 minutes from time.</p>
      <p>Pipita was at it again when he turned in a cross from Juan Cuadrado to give Juventus the lead for the first time in the match.</p>
      <p>Not content with holding on to their slender lead, Dybala celebrated his 200th Serie A game with a goal in injury time. The Bianconeri eventually rubber-stamped their win to go four points clear at the top.</p>
      <p>Here are the three talking points from the matchday-13 fixture between Atalanta and Juventus from the 2019-20 Serie A season:</p>
      <h4>#1 Juventus preserve their unbeaten start to the season</h4>

      <p>The defending eight-time Serie A champions and league leaders remain the team to beat in the Italian top-flight this season. Juventus's 3-1 at Atalanta was their fifth away win from seven games in the 2019-20 Serie A; they have won all six of their league games at home.</p>
      <h4>#2 Higuain scores his first Serie A brace in over a year</h4>
      <p>Higuain scored his first Serie-A brace in over a year as Juventus came from behind to win 3-1 at Atalanta. The Argentine turned in an inspired performance to rescue his side the blushes, and in the process ensured that Ronaldo's absence wasn't felt.</p>
      <h4>#3 Wojciech Szczesny saves a Serie A penalty for the first time this season</h4>

      <p>Having conceded penalties against Lautaro Martinez of Internazionale and Marko Mancuso of Lecce earlier in the season, Juventus keeper Wojciech Szczesny would have been relieved to see Musa Barrow of Atalanta smack the woodwork in the first half of the champions' trip to the Stadio Atleti Azzurri d'Italia.</p>
      <p>However, the Bianconeri custodian failed to keep a clean-sheet on the day as Atalanta took the lead in the second-half before Juventus fought back to claim all three points.</p>
