      <h1>Result: Norwich see off Everton to pile pressure on Silva</h1>
      <h2>Norwich hauled themselves off the bottom of the Premier League table with their first away win of the season to pile the pressure back on <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/everton/"><b>Everton</b></a> manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marco-silva/"><b>Marco Silva</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>After a goalless 10 hours and 20 minutes on the road, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/todd-cantwell/"><b>Todd Cantwell</b></a>’s first strike since the Canaries’ last league success – at home to Manchester City in September – and an added-time effort from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dennis-srbeny/"><b>Dennis Srbeny</b></a>, secured a 2-0 victory.</p>
      <p>It lifted <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/daniel-farke/"><b>Daniel Farke</b></a>’s side to within a point of escaping the bottom three and left Everton just four points above the relegation zone after a sixth defeat in nine league games.</p>

      <p>So, while Norwich are looking up, Silva is looking over his shoulder as seven of their next nine matches are against tough opponents in second-placed Leicester (twice), Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Manchester City.</p>
      <p>It is the month from hell for Silva but Saturday afternoon was not much fun either as Everton’s lack of ambition against a team who had taken one point from their last seven matches, cost them dearly.</p>
      <p>The international break came at the wrong time for the Toffees as the lay-off negated any boost from the win at Southampton but Silva kept faith with the same team.</p>
      <p>But instead of going for the jugular against the Premier League’s bottom side, without a win in two months and after collecting just one point and one goal in six away matches, they were sluggish in their approach.</p>

      <p>In fact, the visitors looked more threatening as they were content to get the ball forward quickly with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/onel-hernandez/"><b>Onel Hernandez</b></a> posing the only real threat with his driving runs.</p>
      <p>Having tested <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jordan-pickford/"><b>Jordan Pickford</b></a> from the edge of the penalty area early on, he forced the England international into a good low save after countering from an Everton corner.</p>
      <p>But none of his team-mates were close to being on the Cuban’s wavelength and most of Norwich’s attempts were deflected shots from distance.</p>
      <p>While Hernandez was causing problems for right-back <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/djibril-sidibe/"><b>Djibril Sidibe</b></a>, only once in the first half did <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/richarlison/"><b>Richarlison</b></a> get a run at the Norwich defence and – when he did – <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/christoph-zimmermann/"><b>Christoph Zimmermann</b></a>, on his first appearance since August because of injury, took a booking to avoid being beaten in a sprint.</p>

      <p>The weak half-time booing was followed by greater consternation when <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/teemu-pukki/"><b>Teemu Pukki</b></a> muscled <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mason-holgate/"><b>Mason Holgate</b></a> off the ball, but his dithering betrayed his lack of confidence – having not scored a league goal since September’s surprise win over Manchester City – and the chance was lost.</p>
      <p>Holgate’s failure to deal with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kenny-mclean/"><b>Kenny McLean</b></a> proved more costly in the 54th minute as Pukki picked up the loose ball and his pass took Holgate and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/yerry-mina/"><b>Yerry Mina</b></a> out of the game as the onrushing Cantwell beat Pickford at his near post.</p>
      <p>Everton’s handball shouts against <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alexander-tettey/"><b>Alexander Tettey</b></a> were optimistic but <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sam-byram/"><b>Sam Byram</b></a>’s free header wide criminally failed to double the visitors’ lead.</p>

      <p>Gylfi Sigurddson and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/cenk-tosun/"><b>Cenk Tosun</b></a> were both denied by low saves from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tim-krul/"><b>Tim Krul</b></a> but they were the best chances in the final 20 minutes as Norwich defended resolutely with Everton running out of ideas.</p>
      <p>Their misery was compounded when Sigurddson’s miscontrol played the ball straight to Srbeny who did not miss from close range.</p>
      <p>The goal sparked a mass exit from Goodison Park and to add insult to injury, Everton fans joined in a chorus of “sacked in the morning” by the visiting supporters.</p>
