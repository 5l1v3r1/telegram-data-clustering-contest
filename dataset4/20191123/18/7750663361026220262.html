      <p>The Lions forward found the top corner with a set-piece strike after 65 minutes to secure a first away win of the season for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gary-rowett/"><b>Gary Rowett</b></a>'s side.</p>
      <p>The new Millwall manager has now claimed 10 points from five matches since taking over in October.</p>
      <p>The defeat meant it was more home woe for Swansea, who have now lost four times at the Liberty Stadium this season.</p>
      <p>Swans boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/steve-cooper/"><b>Steve Cooper</b></a> named an unchanged side for the fourth game running after a run of three games unbeaten.</p>
      <p>The Swans' promotion-chasing form prompted Rowett to make a defensive switch. <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alex-pearce/"><b>Alex Pearce</b></a> came into a back three in place of midfielder <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jayson-molumby/"><b>Jayson Molumby</b></a> while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tom-bradshaw/"><b>Tom Bradshaw</b></a> dropped to the bench to make room for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/connor-mahoney/"><b>Connor Mahoney</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The Lions should have been behind in only the second minute after <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/bersant-celina/"><b>Bersant Celina</b></a> charged across the halfway line and played the ball wide for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andre-ayew/"><b>Andre Ayew</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The Ghanaian's ball across the six-yard box fell perfectly for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nathan-dyer/"><b>Nathan Dyer</b></a>, but he failed to set his feet and instead saw the ball go straight between his legs and harmlessly away.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jon-dadi-bodvarsson/"><b>Jon Dadi Bodvarsson</b></a> headed wide as Millwall recovered from their early scare and began to frustrate the Swans with their defensive organisation.</p>
      <p>Mahoney was the next to threaten before half-time when he beat <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jake-bidwell/"><b>Jake Bidwell</b></a> all ends up and forced <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/freddie-woodman/"><b>Freddie Woodman</b></a> into a save at his near post. Jed Wallace raced onto the loose ball but could only fire over as the teams went in level at half-time.</p>
      <p>Cooper reacted to his side's sloppy showing by sending on Kristoffer Pieterson in place of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/wayne-routledge/"><b>Wayne Routledge</b></a> at the interval.</p>
      <p>The decision almost paid off when the Swedish winger turned Shaun Hutchinson and shot, but Bartosz Bialkowski raced out to block his effort to keep it goalless.</p>
      <p>And the Swans were made to pay after Mike van der Hoorn tangled with Wallace as he threatened to get on the end of a hopeful ball downfield.</p>
      <p>Referee <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andy-davies/"><b>Andy Davies</b></a> blew for a free-kick and booked the Swansea defender, before Wallace dusted himself off and found the top corner with a curling free-kick from 20 yards out.</p>
      <p>Davies had another big call to make in the final 10 minutes when <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/george-byers/"><b>George Byers</b></a> appeared to pull Jiri Skalek down in the box to prevent him getting to Wallace's cross. But the referee waved away the Millwall protests.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sam-surridge/"><b>Sam Surridge</b></a> flicked the ball over the defence to give fellow substitute <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/borja-baston/"><b>Borja Baston</b></a> a clear sight on goal in the final minutes, but the Spanish striker's lob went agonisingly wide as Millwall held on to triumph.</p>
