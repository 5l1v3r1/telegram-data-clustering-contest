        <b>FOR THE WOKE COUPLE<br/></b>
        <b>The green wedding</b>
      </p>
      <p>Weddings don’t tend to be eco-friendly events – there’s food and decor waste, not to mention the carbon footprint of all your guests travelling. An increasing number of couples are looking at adopting eco-friendly ideas to make their shaadi sustainable. From using local wedding suppliers to finding a green venue to tying up with NGOs for managing food waste – it helps you celebrate conscientiously. Wedding planner Sonali Thakore says an eco-friendly wedding doesn’t mean a farm or field as a venue. “It’s a question of reducing the energy and material used to bring the day together. If it’s a destination wedding, source everything from within 100 km, use local arts and textiles of that area,” she says.</p>
      <p>According to her, the ideal setting will be to find a place near the majority of your guests and choose a permanent building like a hall or farmhouse rather than setting up a structure. Other ideas? Reuse a dress, go for vintage, rent your clothes or buy ethical fashion. Go for e-invites, avoid disposables, and get recycled décor items.</p>

        <b>HAPPILY EVER AFTER</b>

        <b>The fairy tale theme</b>
      </p>
      <p>Desi weddings get an angrezi twist with the fairy tale theme as popularised by the Disney movies. From Snow White to Belle to Cinderella – every bride deserves to feel like a princess on her wedding day. Wedding planner Ajay Moudgil says, “Couples are choosing popular Disney songs for their first dance, as these movies have some of the best romantic numbers. This theme ensures that the pictures are awesome as the sets are grand.” Say “I do” on lush green lawns with a sunset backdrop, enjoy al-fresco cocktails by the pool or gorgeous, intimate yet Instagrammable settings – all courtesy this theme.</p>

        <b>Go for MAXIMALISM</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Moroccan theme</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is all about colourful decor and plush settings. Colours vary from dark pinks to oranges, greens, purples, fuchsia to deep corals. The decor is all about gold tablecloths, Moroccan lanterns, low sofas, colourful crockery and ottomans piled high with brilliant jewel-tone pillows. Use fabric that has geometric patterns to recreate the look of Moroccan rugs. Use beaded table runners, create a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/beauty/Why-is-henna-good-for-you/articleshow/21846017.cms">henna</a> station, get the DJ to play a few Mediterranean tunes. And finally, make sure the food has an exotic Moroccan twist.</p>

        <b>TROPULENCE time</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Tropic opulence</b>
      </p>
      <p>The idea behind tropical opulence is to keep the opulence of Indian weddings but with tropical twists of gold accents, luxurious textures and lush florals. This is an extension of boho tropical. Pantone Color Institute created ‘Paradise Found’ – a vibrant wedding colour palette inspired by an escape to the tropical islands. So, while trying this theme mix blues and greens with zesty orange hues. Wedding planner Sonali Thakore says, “You can be creative: use vintage stuff, calligraphy, personalised monograms of the couple, set a greenery photo booth and create a signature fruity welcome drink.”</p>
