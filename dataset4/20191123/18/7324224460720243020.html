      <h1>Darrell Clarke: Walsall draw a fair result</h1>
      <h2>Walsall manager Darrell Clarke has admitted the 0-0 draw with Stevenage was a ‘fair result’ after a game of two halves.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:13:26+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/liam-keen/" target="_blank">Liam Keen</a></address>
      <p>Although neither side created a plethora of chances in the first 45 minutes, Stevenage edged the performance and had most of the possession.</p>
      <p>But after introducing James Hardy and Danny Guthrie at half time, the Saddlers were far more effective in the second half, going close on several occasions.</p>
      <p>Guthrie had a free-kick that rattled off the bar in injury time but the teams shared the points.</p>
      <p>And Clarke felt the result was fair in the end.</p>
      <p>“I thought we were very poor first half,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I made a couple changes to freshen things up a little bit because I don’t think we ever got going first half.</p>
      <p>“They slightly edged the first half.</p>
      <p>“Second half, barring a goalmouth scramble they had, they didn’t really cause us any problems.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had plenty of opportunities to score a goal.</p>
      <p>“In reflection of the game, it’s probably a fair result.</p>
      <p>“They’re the fine lines of the game.</p>
      <p>“I’ve watched four or five Stevenage games and they’ve been in every game, their form of late has picked right up.</p>
      <p>“I think they’ll soon clear themselves away from the danger zone.</p>
      <p>“With ourselves, I thought we needed a little bit more life in the second half and we got that.</p>
      <p>“A bit of quality in the final third but it was good defending from both teams to be honest.</p>
      <p>“Our back four and goalkeeper defended very well and some of their lads had a good game defensively.</p>
      <p>“A game where defenders were on top.”</p>
      <p>Experienced midfielder Guthrie, who put in a superb 45 minute showing, expressed his frustration after the final whistle as the Saddlers failed to score a winning goal.</p>
      <p>“We are frustrated,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We want to win every game at home.</p>
      <p>“Another clean sheet which is a positive, they had chances to be fair to them.</p>
      <p>“We had chances to win the game but we take a point and we’re five unbeaten.”</p>
