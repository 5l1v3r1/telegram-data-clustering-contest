      <h1>How to watch ‘Wilder vs. Ortiz 2’ title fight TONIGHT live on FOX PPV</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Hiergesell</a></address>
      <p>It all goes down later tonight (Sat., Nov. 23, 2019) live on FOX PPV from inside MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, as WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder (41-0-1, 40 KO) puts his title on the line against veteran contender Luis Ortiz (31-1, 26 KO) in a highly-anticipated main event rematch.</p>
      <p>In case you forgot, Wilder and Ortiz fought once before back in March of 2018. Wilder really had to dig deep in that fight to battle through some early adversity, but “Bronze Bomber” was able to claw his way back and score a massive TKO victory over Ortiz in the 10th round. It is the second-latest stoppage in Wilder’s storied career, having finished Johann Duhaupas via 11th-round TKO back in 2015.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, Wilder’s first win over Ortiz was massive. Not only did it prove that Wilder can rebound from early troubles to take out a true veteran heavyweight of the sport, but it paved way for “Bronze Bomber’s” epic matchup with Tyson Fury in late-2018, which ended in the well-known draw. Those course of events have helped shaped the boxing landscape over the past year and brings us to Wilder’s awaited rematch with Ortiz this weekend in Vegas.</p>
      <p>Be sure to catch all the action later tonight as Wilder attempts to extend his unbeaten record and solidify himself as the best heavyweight boxer in the world today. Check out below for all the ways to view the “Wilder vs. Ortiz 2” fight card in its entirety:</p>
