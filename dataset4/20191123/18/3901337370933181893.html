      <p>Bayern Munich registered a third straight win under coach Hansi Flick after thumping Fortuna Dusselford 4-0 in the Bundesliga on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>With one eye on the upcoming UFEA Champions League encounter on Wednesday night, Bayern rested Thiago Alcantara on the bench as Thomas Muller and Corentin Tolisso started for the defending champions.</p>
      <p>Bayern made the perfect start to the encounter after when full-back Joshua Kimmich finished off a well-worked move to hand his side the lead after 11 minutes.</p>
      <p>The visitors managed to find a second goal in the 27th minute as Corentin Tolisso collected a pass from Serge Gnabry before guiding a first-time finish past Steffen.</p>
      <p>Gnabry then bagged a goal to go along with his assist with a neat finish into the bottom corner 10 minutes before the halftime break after some good work by Thomas Muller.</p>
      <p>The Bavarians picked up from where they left off first half, but Dusselfdorf managed to carve out a couple openings just after the hour mark although Adams and Fink were unable to convert.</p>
      <p>However, Bayern grabbed a fourth goal in the 70th minute through Philippe Coutinho who easily slotted home from close range after Muller failed to convert his initial chance.</p>
      <p>The win sees Bayern move up to second spot, one point behind league leaders Borussia Monchengladbach who lost to Wolfsburg.</p>
