      <h1>Every word Roy Hodgson said on Zaha's disappointment, defending VAR and Liverpool performance</h1>
      <h2>The Crystal Palace boss believes the Eagles had their best performance of the season against Liverpool</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:34:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:34</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Trotter</a></address>
      <p>
        <b>One of your best games of the season?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's the usual close but no cigar. I would go further than saying one of our best games of the season, I thought it was our best performance of the season. I thought we really did play well. We were very pleased at half time with the team's performance and that carried on into the second half. It's bitter blow after getting what we thought was a deserved equaliser to have to concede that second goal from the unfortunate corner kick and take away that point that we thought we were more than worth. It's football we have to learn to live with that, there's nothing I can say about it but I do honestly believe that was a very good team performance and on another day would have got us that point.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Unlucky with the VAR call, given other decisions?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I don't want to get involved in those things. The only point I will make and I have made it many times already. There has been such a hoo haw over Arsenal's supposed third goal against us which should have won them the game and what a wicked mistake VAR made. All I'll say to you is the foul at the near post in that instance, where McArthur is bundled over for the player who bundles him over to flick it on for the goal. That was a much clearer and worse foul which luckily for us the VAR picked up. It wasn't a mistake from VAR and I don't think this was a mistake from VAR either. There was a foul at the near post, Jordan did unfortunately push Lovren and VAR picked it up and disallowed it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Very tough month, looking forward to the next run of games?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yeah we have, I don't quite know how to answer it as some of these games coming up will be very difficult for us as well. Burnley and Watford away, Bournemouth, the Brightons, these are very tough games too. We aren't Liverpool or Man City who have got the technical ability to blow these teams away, players like Mane or Salah who score goals for fun. We have to work hard for all of our victories whether it be against the top teams or the bottom teams.</p>
      <p>To say I'm looking forward to the games would be a mistake. Particularly with regard to why we're in the Premier League. I go back a long way with Crystal Palace. There's probably still a few guys watching the game today who go back a long way. From teams like Barrow and Gateshead and Accrington and Bradford Park Albion which is what I was brought up on to be playing year after year against the Liverpools, Chelseas, the Arsenals, Manchester United. That is in itself something you should appreciate and look forward to and you shouldn't ever in any way be critical of the fact of well we've been handed a tough programme of five top teams in a row, we haven't been able to beat them. I think you should be able to shrug that off to some extent as long as you performances have been satisfactory. Make certain if there are any positives from those performances you can take forward, and I believe there are, they are going to come forward into the matches we have now.</p>
      <p>For this club to have seven consecutive years in the Premier League is a good achievement but we are desperate to make it and we are going to need to do that by getting the points in the games coming up and not beating ourselves up too much by not getting a point against Liverpool today.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Joel Ward picked up an injury, are you worried this one is more serious?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes I'm worried because it was a knee to knee clash near the touchline but I can't enlighten you for obvious reasons. He will need to be assessed and that probably won't take place until Monday now. He will have a total examination of the knee injury that he has got then and we will find the extent of it.</p>
      <p>If it's going to be an injury that takes a period of time it's one we can ill afford because as everybody here knows that is an area of the squad where we don't have as much back up as we do in the midfield area. Today we weren't planning to replace Joel Ward, we were planning on giving James McCarthy his chance to come on alongside Schlupp and replace our two unbelievably hardworking midfield players to the side of Luka but that had to be cancelled when Joel went down and Martin had to deputise for him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>First goal for Wilf...</b>
      </p>
      <p>I think drawing criticism from quarters when it comes to being a professional football player is part and parcel of the job. It's something we have to learn to live with and the most important criticisms that Wilf needs to take to heart come from myself or my coaching staff regarding the job we ask him to do.</p>
      <p>Today he was very good, today he was certainly back to his best form. I've not seen him play games against top level opposition much better than he did today. That gives me great heart and hope for the future because we believe in him. He's not just loved by the fans, he's loved by the players and the coaching staff as well because we know what he can do.</p>
      <p>He also needs to understand, which he does, that it's a big responsibility and we are all looking for him to give these sort of performances and to score the goal that he did score. I know he's very disappointed he didn't make it two because that was a really good chance he got at the end from Townsend's wonderful through ball.</p>
