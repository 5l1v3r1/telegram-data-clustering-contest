        <b>Preston’s loss to Derby gave West Brom and Leeds the opportunity to boost their positions in the race for promotion from the Championship.</b>
      </p>
      <p>West Brom and Leeds United benefited from late winners as they took full advantage of a defeat for Preston North End in the Championship.</p>
      <p>Leaders West Brom defeated Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 at home on Saturday, while Marcelo Bielsa’s men won by the same scoreline away to Luton Town.</p>
      <p>Preston fell to a 1-0 defeat away to Derby County, meaning Leeds moved above them into second place, two points behind the Baggies, who have only suffered one defeat in 17 league games.</p>
      <p>Blackburn Rovers, Brentford, Stoke City and Millwall were the other winners in Saturday’s action.</p>
      <p>
        <b>BAGGIES AND LEEDS LAND LATE BLOWS</b>
      </p>
      <p>West Brom and Leeds looked like they were heading for draws that would have stalled their promotion bids before late interventions.</p>
      <p>Charlie Austin netted a penalty with two minutes remaining for the Baggies after goalkeeper Keiren Westwood brought down Matheus Pereira in the box.</p>
      <p>Steven Fletcher had previously scored from the spot at the other end to level the match after Hal Robson-Kanu’s first-half opener, but Wednesday were left frustrated and saw Liam Palmer sent off in stoppage time.</p>

      <p>Leeds’ winner came even later, Matty Pearson’s last-minute own goal gifting them victory as Luton suffered a fifth consecutive defeat. Patrick Bamford and James Collins had exchanged strikes earlier in the second half.</p>
      <p>
        <b>PRESTON &amp; SWANS SLIP UP</b>
      </p>
      <p>Preston fell to Derby, who have now won five consecutive home games.</p>
      <p>Derby substitute Martyn Waghorn, only just on for the injured Mason Bennett, scored a close-range effort after 33 minutes which proved decisive.</p>
      <p>Swansea also lost 1-0, their first defeat in four coming courtesy of an excellent free-kick from Millwall’s Jed Wallace with 25 minutes left at the Liberty Stadium.</p>

        <b>DIOUF CAPS STOKE COMEBACK AS DACK DENIES STRUBER</b>
      </p>
      <p>Only goal difference separates Stoke from fourth-bottom Luton after Mame Biram Diouf’s strike in the third minute of added time earned a 2-1 win over Wigan Athletic.</p>
      <p>Michael O’Neill’s first home game in charge had appeared to be heading for a draw when Danny Batth levelled the contest following Sam Morsy’s opener, but Diouf ensured the new Stoke boss secured a second victory from as many matches.</p>
      <p>Bradley Dack scored twice, including the winner with four minutes left, as Blackburn earned a thrilling 3-2 triumph over bottom-of-the-table Barnsley, who were being managed by Gerhard Struber for the first time.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Cardiff City came from two goals down to salvage a 2-2 draw at Charlton Athletic in Neil Harris’ opening game in charge, while Bristol City and Nottingham Forest, who had Ryan Yates sent off, played out a goalless draw.</p>
      <p>A late Marc Roberts equaliser, the defender’s first goal since April 2018, gave Birmingham City a 1-1 draw at Huddersfield Town, while Brentford are two points off the play-off places after Ollie Watkins’ 11th league goal of the season earned a 1-0 home win over Reading.</p>
