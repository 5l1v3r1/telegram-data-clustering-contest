      <h1>Sanjay Raut put Uddhav in a mess: BJP </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:32:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/mrityunjay-bose" target="_blank">Mrityunjay Bose</a></address>
      <p>Amid fast-changing political scenario, top BJP leaders on Saturday accused Sanjay Raut of putting Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray in a mess.</p>
      <p>"He (Raut) should stop speaking now... He has ruined the Shiv Sena and has put Uddhav Thackeray in a mess," state BJP president Chandrakant Patil said, adding that the mandate was for the BJP-led MahaYuti but the Shiv Sena backed out and started talking with the NCP and the Congress.</p>
      <p>"At no stage, they were speaking to us... They betrayed the mandate," said Patil, a former revenue minister and who is close to BJP president Amit Shah.</p>
      <p>"Shiv Sena left Hindutva, it was ready to do anything for power," said Patil.</p>
      <p>BJP's troubleshooter and a close aide of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, Girish Mahajan said, "The government could not have been formed without two parties coming together."</p>
      <p>"Shiv Sena MPs and MLAs are fed up of Sanjay Raut," he said.</p>
      <p> Both Patil and Mahajan said that the demand of Uddhav for rotating the chief minister's post was illogical and no such promise was made during the seat-sharing and power-sharing talks.</p>
