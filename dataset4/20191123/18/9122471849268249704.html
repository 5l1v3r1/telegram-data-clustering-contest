      <h1>Reports: Florida State Is Trying To Hire A “Huge Name”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:26:46+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Florida State’s football program is in the middle of a head coaching search. The latest reports suggest that the Seminoles are going “big-game” hunting.</p>
      <p>247Sports <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/Florida-State-Seminoles-Coaching-Search-rumors-Mark-Stoops-Kentucky-head-coach-139035771/">reported earlier today</a> that Kentucky head coach Mark Stoops had removed himself from consideration for the job.</p>
      <p>The report states that Stoops was not offered the job. It appears that Stoops got the sense that the Seminoles were interested in the Kentucky head coach, but probably as a backup option.</p>
      <blockquote>According to a source, Stoops did not know which direction Thrasher and Coburn are headed with their search, but he did say he feels FSU is looking to go “big game hunting” with the upcoming hire.</blockquote>
      <p>Kentucky Sports Radio’s Matt Jones echoed these reports.</p>
      <p>“Bottom line…I think (FSU) is trying for a huge name and wanted Stoops as a backup option if it didn’t happen,” he tweeted.</p>

      <p><a href="https://thespun.com/acc/florida-state/florida-state-candidates-head-coach-hire-search">The Spun has heard from sources</a> that Florida State has been interested in a big name all along. Urban Meyer and Brian Kelly were the two names floated following Willie Taggart’s firing. Meyer does not appear to be happening, while Kelly could still be in play.</p>
      <p>Reports this week confirmed what we have been hearing about Kelly.</p>
      <p>“Two people have told us they [FSU] has interest in Brian Kelly…I think he’d be an excellent candidate. There’s a little bit of questions about the fit, but the proven track record of hiring assistant coaches and having them get promoted to other jobs and hiring new ones who are as good or better is really impressive. He’s a really good recruiter with his staff. I think he knows what goes on in the Southeast, because we know he’s recruited some of these guys, and not always gotten them, but we know that’s due to some of the academic stuff…” <a href="https://thespun.com/acc/florida-state/florida-state-coaching-search-brian-kelly-interest">the Nolecast said this week</a>.</p>
      <p>Florida State is currently being led by interim head coach Odell Haggins Jr. There are some players calling for him to get the full-time job, though you probably don’t fire Taggart midway through his second season just to promote one of his assistants.</p>
