      <p>The UK has seen a record-breaking number of people registering to vote in a single day ahead of the cut-off date, in what is thought to be the biggest ever pre-deadline surge.</p>
      <p>On Friday, 308,000 people registered to vote in next month’s General Election in just 24 hours.</p>
      <p>An incredible 200,000 of those who signed up on National Voter Registration Day, were below the age of 35.</p>
      <p>The hashtag #RegisterToVote has been circling social media and backed by trade unions, campaigners and the Labour party, in a bid to make sure everyone is eligible to vote.</p>
      <p>The hike in figures, issued by the Cabinet Office, came with just four days to go until the cut-off date to register to vote in the December 12 election.</p>
      <p>These figures could suggest a boost in Labour’s votes next month, after the party received a wave of support from young voters in the 2017 poll.</p>

      <p>Around 60 per cent of voters aged 18 to 24 backed Jeremy Corbyn’s party, while 61 per cent of over 64s voted for the Tories in 2015.</p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn took to Twitter to express his delight at the amount who had signed up – most of whom had done so online.</p>
      <p>He wrote: ‘Yesterday Labour got behind National Voter Registration Day – unlike the Conservatives – because we want you to have a say in the future of our country.</p>
      <p>‘And more than 300,000 people registered to vote. Make sure you can have your say on 12th December.’</p>
      <p>Those signing up on Friday, included 103,000 below the age of 25, another 103,000 25 to 34-year-olds, 53,000 35 to 44-year-olds, 28,500 45 to 54-year-olds and about 20,000 over 54s.</p>
      <p>An Electoral Commission spokesperson told The Independent: ‘It’s great to see so many organisations working alongside us to encourage people to register to vote. These efforts are clearly delivering results.</p>
      <p>‘However, with up to one in six people potentially unregistered there is more work to do to ensure that they can register by the 26 November deadline. It only takes five minutes to register at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote">gov.uk/register-to-vote</a>.’</p>
      <p>The cut off time to register to vote online in the General Election is 11.59pm on November 26.</p>
      <p>If you want to apply to vote by post in England, Scotland or Wales, register before 5pm on the same date.</p>
