      <p>Protesters gathered outside the Victoria Conference Centre Saturday morning to try to push the BC NDP toward more progressive policies with regard to the province's overdose crisis. </p>
      <p>The NDP are holding their 2019 convention there this weekend. Protesters hailed from community activist groups around Vancouver Island, <a href="https://bc.ctvnews.ca/activists-outside-bc-ndp-convention-push-for-party-to-support-safe-drug-supply-1.4699611">CTV News</a> reports. </p>
      <p>"We're a collective of agencies in the Victoria community who are committed to seeing drug policy changes and an end to the deaths that continue," said Jennifer Howard, who held a sign reading "safe supply saves lives. Do something NOW."</p>
      <p>Howard said the goal was to push the NDP to decriminalize drugs and provide a safe supply for those who are addicted. </p>
      <p>"We're asking - and demanding - that they get down to work and pass this resolution," Howard said.</p>
      <p>"4,500 British Columbians have died, including my son, since 2016. Many families are mourning the loss of a loved one. We can't continue to sit back and not do more, and the way to end this crisis is to enact safe supply and decriminalization for those who struggle."</p>
      <p>Premier John Horgan did not commit to supporting the resolution, only saying they will be "debating" the issue during the convention. </p>
      <p>"We've been working tirelessly," Horgan said. "We've seen a decline in overdose deaths, but it's still not acceptable. We're going to work and look at new therapies, new ideas, new suggestions all the time."</p>
      <p>Howard said that while the NDP has expanded services and programs in response to the opioid crisis since taking office, there is much more they need to do. </p>
      <p>"We don't want to see the NDP sitting back, patting themselves on the back saying, 'Our work is done,' around the overdose crisis," she said. "Their work is far from done."</p>
