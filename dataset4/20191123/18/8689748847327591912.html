      <h1>Blakk Cedi Spotted In New Video Jamming To Kelvyn Boy’s New Diss Song Aimed At Stonebwoy</h1>

      <p>The wind of confusion is still blowing in the camp of Stonebwoy as his former manager, Blakk Cedi has been spotted jamming to Kelvyn Boy’s new song which is purported to be a diss song to the Bhim Boss.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.ghbase.com/confusion-in-bhim-camp-stonewboy-found-out-blakk-cedi-signed-kelvyn-boy-to-his-own-record-label/">Blakk Cedi’s managerial duties have been stripped off</a> </b>and instead demoted to a mere agent by Stonebwoy.</p>
      <p>Obviously this has not gone down well with him and it’s no wonder he’s now more aligned to Kelvyn Boy who was axed by Stonebwoy from Burniton Music Group not too long ago.</p>
      <p>In the video attached to this report , Blakk Cedi and Kelvyn Boy are seen in the company of other friends singing and jamming to Kelvyn Boy’s new song titled, ‘Yawa No Dey.’</p>
      <p>A part of the song goes thus: “Chale, I be cool, atamfo ani awu. Moaye afere. Yawa no dey,” he sang – to wit, ‘I’m cool, haters have bowed down their heads in shame. I remain strong.’</p>
      <p>This new video confirms Blakk Cedi has joined forces with the Mea hitmaker to jab Stonebwoy who thought Kelvyn Boy won’t make it without him.</p>
