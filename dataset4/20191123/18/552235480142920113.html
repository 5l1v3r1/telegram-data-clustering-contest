      <h1>Austin MacPhee insists Hearts thrashing at Kilmarnock won't harm his job chances</h1>
      <h2>The interim gaffer watched his side get battered at Rugby Park but he believes he's still capable of the job.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:00:39+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Austin MacPhee insists <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> 3-0 defeat to Kilmarnock won't have an adverse effect on his bid to become permanent manager.</p>
      <p>The interim boss was shellshocked as his side were 3-0 down within 16 minutes of the game.</p>
      <p>Chris Burke got a double either side of grabbing an assist for Eamonn Brophy as Hearts struggled to deal with the attacking threat of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/angelo-alessio">Angelo Alessio's</a> men.</p>
      <p>But after winning 5-2 before the international break against St Mirren, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/austin-macphee">MacPhee</a> reckons neither result will make much difference.</p>
      <p>And he's already making plans for being in charge of the team when they go to Ibrox to face <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> next weekend.</p>
      <p>He told BBC Scotland: "Winning 5-2 doesn't mean too much about where I stand in the club and neither does losing 3-0.</p>

      <p>"There's a bigger picture here and the board will be considering this over time, all I'll do is do my best if I'm preparing the team for Ibrox next Sunday.</p>
      <p>"One thing for sure is we can't start the game like that, we can't make such basic defensive errors like that or it will be a long 90 minutes at Ibrox.</p>
      <p>"I'm convinced the players and I are on the same page for this and we'll make sure we're prepared for going to Ibrox next Sunday.</p>
      <p>"As I've said since I've been asked to take the team in this role, I speak to Ann Budge every day and I'll proceed until I'm told otherwise."</p>
      <p>The early onslaught from Killie meant Hearts were never really in the game and MacPhee admits it was always going to be a real struggle because of the mistakes they made in their own defensive third - coupled with the lack of a cutting edge going forward.</p>
      <p>He said: "If you lose three goals in such a short period of time, as early in the game, then your gameplan goes out the window and that's what we talked about after the game.</p>
      <p>"It's so difficult when you give a team like Kilmarnock that foot up in the game and we're bitterly disappointed with the goals that we've lost and the fact we're out of the game so early.</p>

      <p>"We had chances as well, we had four clear headers in the box that we've got to do better with. Some of the our play around the edge of the box where we should be working their goalkeeper more bu tit's been a very disappointing performance the players and myself are in agreement with that.</p>
      <p>"If you can score early then you've still got a chance in the game. We came out, we had a lot of possession in the final third but we didn't ask them enough questions. We weren't aggressive enough in the box when the ball came into it, our crosses were far too hung up and the keeper could come for too many of them.</p>
      <p>"We lacked that little bit of spark we had last week. Obviously on the back of being 3-0 down at half time you need a bit of a break to build on but we never got that and as the game wore on, Kilmarnock are well organised and defend low and they then bothered us on the counter attack."</p>
