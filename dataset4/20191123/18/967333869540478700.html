      <p>​Earlier in the day, Spain’s <i>Mundo newspaper</i> reported that a <a href="https://www.elmundo.es/espana/2019/11/23/5dd84d14fdddff2c898b45ec.html">Russian national and a Ukrainian were detained</a> in Girona in October, with an M75 hand grenade seized during a search of their car. The incident is reportedly a part of a probe into the alleged malign influence of Russia in Catalonia.</p>
      <p>Moscow has repeatedly refuted allegations of its meddling in other countries' internal affairs, pointing to the lack of proof. The Russian leadership has suggested that the claims of foreign interference are often used to distract people from acute domestic issues.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911121077283320-catalan-protesters-plan-to-keep-spain-france-highway-blockade-for-3-days/">pro-independence protests in Catalonia began in mid-October</a> as the Spanish Supreme Court sentenced nine Catalans to lengthy prison terms over their involvement in the 2017 Catalan independence referendum. Hundreds of people have been arrested and injured in the unrest, including police officers.</p>
