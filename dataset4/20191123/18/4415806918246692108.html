      <h1>Mourneabbey retain Senior All-Ireland title courtesy of late Laura Fitzgerald point</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:42:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/eoghan-cormican/" target="_blank">By Eoghan Cormican</a></address>
      <p>Mourneabbey (Cork) 2-9 - 0-14 Kilkerrin-Clonberne (Galway)</p>
      <p>A Laura Fitzgerald point with 16 seconds remaining secured the ladies footballers of Mourneabbey back-to-back All-Ireland senior club titles.</p>
      <p>With Chloe Miskell and Annette Clarke having landed points to bring Kilkerrin-Clonberne level in the 53rd minute, the Galway and Connacht champions then had four opportunities to go in front. Not a single one, however, were they able to take. Olivia Divilly, with a free from the 20-metre line, dropped the ball shirt, while Ailish Morrissey, Clarke, and Claire Dunleavy all tallied wides.</p>
      <p>The final appeared to be headed to extra-time, but Mourneabbey’s final play, which began in their own full-back line with one minute remaining, ended with Laura Fitzgerald throwing over the winners 16 seconds from the hooter.</p>
      <p>Fitzgerald was responsible for Mourneabbey’s second goal on 45 minutes, a green flag which left the scoreboard reading 2-8 to 0-12 in Mourneabbey’s favour.</p>
      <p>Kilkerrin-Clonberne, as they had done in the first-half, made the better start to the second period and although they were reduced to 14 when Lynsey Noone was sin-binned, they temporarily held the lead following a fine Ailish Morrissey score.</p>

      <p>A yellow card to Ciara O’Sullivan meant Mourneabbey finished the game with 14, but it mattered not as they surged late to successfully defend their crown.</p>
      <p>Mourneabbey, despite yet another sluggish start, had eked their way in front come the interval hooter, the reigning champions 1-6 to 0-8 ahead.</p>
      <p>It was Doireann O’Sullivan who supplied the Mourneabbey goal 14 minutes in, the Cork forward played through by Noelle Healy. The latter kicked a pair of points to sandwich the final’s opening major, this 1-2 burst moving Mourneabbey into a 1-3 to 0-5 lead.</p>
      <p>An Olivia Divilly free subsequently tied matters - the direct running of the Galway forward so instrumental to a blistering Kilkerrin-Clonberne start which had them 0-5 to 0-1 clear after 12 minutes - but Mourneabbey had the ball in the opposition goal for a second time shortly after, Laura Fitzgerald palming home a sweeping move involving Roisin and Ciara O’Sullivan, as well as Healy.</p>

      <p>After much consultation, however, referee Maggie Farrelly disallowed the goal because of square ball.</p>
      <p>A Doireann O’Sullivan free and a pair from play from sister Ciara and Laura Fitzgerald snuck - and kept - Mourneabbey noses in front between there and the break, despite Eva Noone and Annette Clarke raising white flags at the other end.</p>
      <p>One point was also the difference at the end of the second period, too, Mourneabbey reaffirming their status as the dominant club side in the land.</p>
