          <p>Manchester City is having a crucial game against Chelsea, as Pep Guardiola’s side is slowly losing grip for the title race. Thus, this match is necessary for Manchester City to keep their fight alive.</p>
          <p>Moreover, considering Chelsea is just one point ahead of Manchester City for the third spot, Manchester City has to win the game to advance in the table as they were dropped to 4th with a loss against Liverpool in the last game-week.</p>

                          <p>It felt like all the heavens have fallen on Manchester City, as another loss would have cost them the title contention, once for all, considering <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/var-controversy-crystal-palace-denied-goal-against-liverpool-by-var-over-soft-touch/">Liverpool</a> and Leicester City have already won the match, and if the score had stayed, Chelsea would also have gained the lead.</p>

                            <p>However, Manchester City hit back brilliantly to tell why they are the champions of England, as a strike by Kevin De Bruyne in the 29th minute equalized the score and a phenomenal finish by Riyad Mahrez gave Manchester City a crucial lead.</p>
                            <p>The game comes to a halt with the half-time whistle and the score stands 2-1 in favour of the home team. Considering the pace of the game, the second half is expected to be even more breathtaking.</p>
