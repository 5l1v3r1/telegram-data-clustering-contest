        <b>Lyon 6-13 Leinster</b>
      </p>
      <p>Leinster dug deep to come out on top in a tough away clash against Lyon today.</p>
      <p>Lyon out-half Jonathan Wisniewski missed an early drop-goal attempt before Leinster went ahead through a Johnny Sexton penalty.</p>
      <p>Lyon were putting heavy pressure on the visitors but Leinster's defence came up with the goods for what proved to be the game's only try.</p>
      <p>Josh van der Flier won the ball before giving it to James Ryan.</p>
      <p>Tadhg Furlong and Rob Kearney were also involved in the move which eventually saw Max Deegan touch down.</p>
      <p>Sexton converted before Lyon went in search of a try of their own.</p>
      <p>Leinster were under pressure for much of the game but they managed to hold firm for a crucial win.</p>
      <p>Next up in the Champions Cup for Leo Cullen's side is Northampton Saints, who beat Benetton today.</p>
