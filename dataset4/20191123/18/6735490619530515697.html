      <p>Meghan McCain has had enough.</p>
      <p>“The View” co-host announced on Friday that she has disabled Instagram comments after receiving an excessive amount of “abuse and threats.”</p>
      <p>“Turning off commenting on Instagram for the time being,” she said in a post. “I have family and young people in my life who can read it. You can disagree with my politics all you want but the abuse and threats is too far.”</p>

      <p>She frequently gets in arguments with her co-hosts, most recently over the impeachment hearing of Donald Trump or going head to head with<a href="https://etcanada.com/news/536986/donald-trump-jr-appears-on-the-view-show-descends-into-chaos-as-he-clashes-with-the-panel/"> Donald Trump Jr.</a> when he was on the show.</p>
      <p>Her Instagram posts are also dividing like her throwback photo of her prepping for the “zombie apocalypse” while at a shooting range.</p>
