      <p>Town's unbeaten run at home now stretches to five games although they are just four points above the relegation zone ahead of Middlesbrough's game against Hull on Sunday.</p>
      <p>For Birmingham, this was a rarity in that it was only a second stalemate in 17 league games and they remain in mid-table.</p>
      <p>The opening exchanges were gritty with plenty of tough but honest tackles flying in, although the game was initially shy of goalscoring opportunities.</p>
      <p>Huddersfield fashioned the first chance of the game and they were gifted it by a Birmingham player.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lukas-jutkiewicz/"><b>Lukas Jutkiewicz</b></a> did well to shield the ball off a couple of Town players but then cheaply gifted possession to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/elias-kachunga/"><b>Elias Kachunga</b></a>, but he could only blaze a shot over the bar from the edge of the box.</p>
      <p>Birmingham's first meaningful effort came when <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jude-bellingham/"><b>Jude Bellingham</b></a> waltzed through the defence but blasted a shot well over the Town crossbar.</p>
      <p>Down the other end <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/karlan-grant/"><b>Karlan Grant</b></a>'s fizzed centre picked out <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alex-pritchard/"><b>Alex Pritchard</b></a>, making his first start since August. He connected well with a volley but saw it blocked.</p>
      <p>Huddersfield came closest to the breakthrough 10 minutes before the interval but were denied by some fine goalkeeping and plucky defending.</p>
      <p>Blues' stopper <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/connal-trueman/"><b>Connal Trueman</b></a> pulled off a great reaction stop to keep outÂ  Kachunga's header from close-range before Campbell's follow-up effort was charged down by Roberts.</p>
      <p>Trueman had to be alert again just before the interval when he tipped behind Pritchard's free-kick from long-range.</p>
      <p>Campbell made the breakthrough the game badly needed after 55 minutes. <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/trevoh-chalobah/"><b>Trevoh Chalobah</b></a>'s expert through-ball picked him out and he coolly finished past Trueman for his second goal of the season.</p>
      <p>Going a goal down prompted Birmingham to be more creative going forward and Bellingham blazed over after being teed up by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jacques-maghoma/"><b>Jacques Maghoma</b></a>'s centre on the hour mark.</p>
      <p>Jutkiewicz remained a threat, especially aerially, and he planted a header wide on 71 minutes.</p>
      <p>Town's top scorer Grant had been a peripheral figure for most of the game but he carved out a decent chance only to fire a shot straight at Trueman.</p>
      <p>Huddersfield ultimately paid the price for their wastefulness in front of goal on 78 minutes and it came from Birmingham's first attempt on target.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dan-crowley/"><b>Dan Crowley</b></a> swung in a free-kick and Roberts nodded the ball home inside the box via a hefty deflection off colleague Jutkiewicz.</p>
      <p>City could have pinched the win late on but substitute <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alvaro-gimenez/"><b>Alvaro Gimenez</b></a> saw his fierce attempt draw a fine stop from home goalkeeper <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kamil-grabara/"><b>Kamil Grabara</b></a> as the game petered out to a draw.</p>
