      <p>The visitors had looked the better side until midfielder <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ryan-yates/"><b>Ryan Yates</b></a> picked up a straight red card from referee <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/craig-pawson/"><b>Craig Pawson</b></a> after 56 minutes for a challenge on <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/adam-nagy/"><b>Adam Nagy</b></a>, which provoked an angry reaction from City players.</p>
      <p>From then on City poured forward in search of a winner, but were unable to create many clear openings against determined and well-organised opponents.</p>
      <p>Both sides attacked with promise in an open first half, but it was Forest who carried the greater threat.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tiago-silva/"><b>Tiago Silva</b></a>'s eighth-minute shot from just outside the box was deflected wide and the resulting corner to the far post saw Yates get in a low drive, only for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/famara-diedhiou/"><b>Famara Diedhiou</b></a> to clear off the line.</p>
      <p>The visitors continued to create chances and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joe-lolley/"><b>Joe Lolley</b></a>'s 15th-minute shot was saved by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dan-bentley/"><b>Dan Bentley</b></a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lewis-grabban/"><b>Lewis Grabban</b></a> saw a 24th-minute effort deflected over before <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andreas-weimann/"><b>Andreas Weimann</b></a> put in City's first goal attempt of note, a long-range shot that was a yard wide.</p>
      <p>Forest's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sammy-ameobi/"><b>Sammy Ameobi</b></a> picked up the first yellow card of the game for a late challenge after 36 minutes.</p>
      <p>By then both defences were looking more secure, but it was City who could feel happier with the goalless half-time score having been under plenty of pressure.</p>
      <p>Forest began the second half in a similar fashion to the first and Bentley had to make a 50th-minute save to keep out Silva's low drive.</p>
      <p>But City were soon flexing their attacking muscles and went close to a 55th-minute lead when Weimann's low cross from the right took a deflection and struck the far post.</p>
      <p>Then came Yates' reckless moment and 10-man Forest suddenly faced an uphill task.</p>
      <p>Boss Sabri Lamouchi responded with a substitution, taking off Ameobi and sending on former City winger Albert Adomah.</p>
      <p>City head coach Lee Johnson quickly made two changes of his own, introducing <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kasey-palmer/"><b>Kasey Palmer</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/niclas-eliasson/"><b>Niclas Eliasson</b></a> for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/bailey-wright/"><b>Bailey Wright</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/callum-odowda/"><b>Callum O'Dowda</b></a> and switching to 4-4-2 from his wing-back formation.</p>
      <p>Forest had a great chance to take the lead after 73 minutes when mistakes by Nagy and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/adam-baker/"><b>Adam Baker</b></a> gifted a chance to Grabban, who lobbed Bentley but saw his effort go wide.</p>
      <p>Weimann almost capitalised at the other end, but his volley from 12 yards cleared the crossbar. It was the striker's last action before being replaced by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/rodri/"><b>Rodri</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Forest goalkeeper <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/brice-samba/"><b>Brice Samba</b></a> was booked for time-wasting in the closing stages as his team had to defend a series of dangerous Eliasson crosses.</p>
      <p>Rodri volleyed over from close range following an Eliasson corner and it proved City's last chance.</p>
