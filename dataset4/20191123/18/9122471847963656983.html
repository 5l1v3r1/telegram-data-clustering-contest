      <h1>Ian Rapoport Reveals How Much Mason Rudolph Was Fined By The NFL</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:05:33+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>According to a report from Ian Rapoport of the NFL Network, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph was fined $50,000 for his role in his team’s brawl with the Cleveland Browns last Thursday night. Rapoport also reports that other players were fined as well.</p>
      <p>The brawl, which was the talk of the sports world for a full week, resulted in a number of suspensions – including the indefinite suspension of Browns defensive end Myles Garrett, who swung and hit Rudolph in the head with a helmet.</p>
      <p>Rudolph was not suspended, which didn’t sit well with some fans. Many argue that he was one of the instigators of the brawl because of his skirmish with Garrett on the ground.</p>
      <p>While $50,000 may not seem like a lot to an NFL player, Rudolph is still playing on a rookie contract. He signed a four-year deal worth $3.92 million back in 2018.</p>

      <p>This week, ESPN’s Adam Schefter leaked that Garrett, in his meeting with the NFL, claimed that Rudolph had uttered a racial slur before the brawl. Rudolph’s lawyer issued a statement in response, calling it a “lie.”</p>

      <p>It remains to be seen when Garrett will be allowed to return to the field. His suspension was upheld by the NFL this week, so it won’t be until the 2020 season at earliest.</p>
      <p>Rudolph, meanwhile, will suit up for his team’s game against Cincinnati on Sunday.</p>
