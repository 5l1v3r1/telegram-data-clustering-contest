      <h1>'New coach' - Tony Adams goes on passionate rant about Unai Emery and Arsenal</h1>
      <h2>Tony Adams has been speaking about Unai Emery and Arsenal after the clash against Southampton</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Tony Adams has issued a strong response to Arsenal's 'disjointed' 2-2 draw at home to Southampton which saw the Gunners winless run in the Premier League stretch to five games.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have dropped down to seventh in the top tier and the result has only added to the pressure on the shoulders of boss Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard is enduring a tough second season at the Emirates and has been accused of not improving the team since Arsene Wenger left the club last year.</p>
      <p>Fans of the Gunners are becoming increasingly tired of the inconsistent play under Emery and in many ways, Adams has now perfectly summed up the discontent around the club.</p>
      <p>During an appearance on BT Sport's results show, Adams was quick to heavily criticise the performance from Arsenal and Emery himself.</p>
      <p>"The boos are deserved. It was a terrible performance and very disjointed," Adams told BT Sport. "There was no defending in sight and they changed the system three times. He (Emery) is not doing himself any favours.</p>
      <p>"That was a really poor performance and I don't want any coach losing his job but the club is not going forward and progressing.</p>
      <p>"The recruitment has been poor and we got rid of (Laurent) Koscielny and (Aaron) Ramsey and the team is weaker for that.</p>
      <p>"I could put a team together that is more organised and enthusiastic than that. There is nobody actually going out in that game to get a clean sheet. There doesn't look like a clean sheet in sight. We kept 24 clean sheets in one season once."</p>
      <p>Whilst Adams knows some of the new signings including Nicolas Pepe need time to prove their worth, the club legend gave a stark verdict on Emery.</p>

      <p>Adams added: "You have to give it time with the recruitment but this coach is just a head coach. You need a head coach to work with the players. He is not improving this group of players. We need a new coach for that."</p>
