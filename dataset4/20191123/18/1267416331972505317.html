      <h1>Staples coupon code gives an extra 10 percent off Surface Pro 7, Laptop 3</h1>
      <h2>Your mileage may vary with the code, and it only works in-store</h2>

      <p>Deal hunters looking to get <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/10/02/surface-pro-x-7-laptop-3-hands-on/">the latest Microsoft Surface devices</a> at a discount have some excellent options.</p>
      <p>Microsoft is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/store/configure/Surface-Pro-7/8N17J0M5ZZQS?crosssellid=drawer1&amp;selectedColor=86888a&amp;preview=&amp;previewModes=">running a sale on its online store</a> offering between $150 and $300 off select Surface Pro 7 models. Tech stores have lowered prices to match the deal, but according to RedFlagDeals, Staples goes above and beyond.</p>
      <p>The retailer is reportedly offering an additional 10 percent off through the use of coupon codes. The codes don’t work online but reportedly work in-store. That said, the RedFlagDeals user who shared the codes says cashiers may ask for the physical coupon and warns your mileage may vary.</p>
      <p>That said, the discounts bring down the price fairly significantly. Some entry-level models are listed below as an example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Surface Pro 7 i5 variant with 8GB RAM, 128GB storage: $945 (regular $1,199)</li>
        <li>Surface Laptop 3 i5 variant with 8GB RAM, 128GB storage: $1,080 (regular $1,349).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Interestingly, the code works for the Surface Laptop 3 as well, which isn’t currently on sale. In other words, the deal isn’t quite as good, but still overall excellent if you’d rather get the laptop.</p>
