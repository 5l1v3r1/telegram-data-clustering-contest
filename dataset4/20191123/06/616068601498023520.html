      <p>RCMP in Barriere, north of Kamloops,Â say they are looking for a suspect in an apparent attempt to abduct a child.</p>
      <p>They say a 10-year-old girl was walking Friday about 3:30 p.m. when she was approached by a man she didn't know.</p>
      <p>Police spokesman Cpl. Rob Welsman says the man grabbed the girl by the wrist but she was able to free herself and run away.</p>
      <p>A police dog was brought in to search for the suspect in the area of Barriere Town Road and Dunn Lake Road and officers also canvassed residents about the incident.</p>
      <p>Police say the suspect is described as being about 40-years-old, five-feet-seven inches tall with hazel eyes, short brown hair and a full brown beard about four inches in length shaped to a point at the end.</p>
      <p>Anyone with video surveillance, dashboard camera footage, or any information about the incident is asked to contact the local Mounties.</p>
