      <h1>Police Search Underway For 25 Y.O. British Tourist Missing In VIC Bushland</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:18:41+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:18</time> by <a rel="author">By Josephine Rozenberg-Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Police search teams are working tirelessly to locate a British tourist missing in bushland near the Twelve Apostles in Victoria after he suffered a head injury and ran into the wilderness in the early hours of this morning.</p>
      <p><b>Aslan King</b>, a 25-year-old illustrator and designer visiting Australia from the UK city of Bristol, was camping with friends off Old Coach Road near Princetown when he ran off at around 2am, according to <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/aslan-king-british-tourist-missing-in-bushland-princetown/7c386676-27fe-4c61-8142-3b2a7603ca2e">Nine News</a>.</p>
      <p>King reportedly suffered a “medical episode” which led to him hitting his head. According to a <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/disoriented-lost-in-the-bush-british-camper-missing-near-twelve-apostles-20191123-p53dea.html">police spokesperson</a>, he “suddenly got up and ran from the area into surrounding bushland”. While his friends attempted to find him, they were unable to locate King. It’s believed he became disoriented and lost in the dense bushland.</p>
      <p>Victoria Police have released a photo taken of Aslan King yesterday, indicating that he was last seen wearing the same clothing, minus the jacket.</p>
