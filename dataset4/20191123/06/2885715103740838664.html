        <figcaption>Addressing the media soon after taking the oath, Fadnavis said, "I want to thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi for trusting in me. People had given a clear mandate. Shiv Sena rejected the mandate." "We want to assure the people of Maharashtra that whatever the challenges they are facing, we are going to face them strongly. We stand with the farmers during their time of distress," he added. (Express Photo)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The development comes a day after the alliance between Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress reached a consensus that Uddhav Thackeray would be the new Chief Minister of the state, heading a government of their alliance. NCP chief Sharad Pawar had told reporters, “As far as the Chief Minister’s post goes, there is consensus between the three parties that Uddhav Thackeray will lead the government.” (Express Photo)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>While the details of the alliance are yet to be announced, Ajit, the nephew of NCP chief Sharad Pawar, seems to have sprung a surprise on his party. The BJP won 105 seats in the 228-member Assembly, while the NCP had garnered 54 seats. Apart from Ajit, no other NCP leader was present at the swearing-in ceremony. (Express Photo)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>There were hectic but discreet negotiations between the BJP’s top leadership and NCP’s Ajit Pawar over the past few days. For this, BJP national president Amit Shah had put on the job his most trusted lieutenant, Bhupender Yadav, who is the party general secretary and in-charge of elections in Maharashtra. Even as the closed-room talks between NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and the Congress leaders were taking place, and there were revelations before the media by them, the BJP kept its cards close to its chest.
