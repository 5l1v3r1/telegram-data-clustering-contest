      <p>Today morning, the BJP completely took everyone by surprise when it was announced that Devendra Fadnavis is back again as Maharashtra Chief Minister while Ajit Pawar as his deputy. Earlier, during the Maharashtra elections phase, Fadnavis had resigned from his post when no party was able to form the government with a majority. This surprise swearing-in early today morning is now being described as a political masterstroke of Sharad Pawar, who until Thursday night had said there was an agreement between the NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena that Uddhav Thackeray should lead the new government. </p>
      <p>However, with Devendra Fadnavis back to his position, it not only stunned Shiv Sena and Congress but also the whole nation. Devendra Fadnavis took oath early morning in front of the government leaders and official media. As soon as the decision broke in the media, Twitterati started losing their mind on this political masterstroke and started calling this climax just as HBO’s hit show, Game Of Thrones. </p>

      <p>One Twitter user wrote, “Ajit Pawar turning on his uncle to form the government with BJP with Fadnavis as CM, NOT EVEN A DAY AFTER his uncle said Uddhav Thackeray would make CM. Proper Game of Thrones stuff. While one wrote, "#MaharashtraPolitics finale looks much better than game of thrones finale. There was another one said, “#MaharashtraPolitics scriptwriter for the new game of thrones Maharashtra edition.” Guess, one thinks Amit Shah would have been a better choice for GoT. "MaharashtraPolitics Game of Thrones season 8 would have been much better if Amit Shah had written it. What a crazy twist in Maharashtra! #MaharashtraPolitics”</p>

      <p>Soon after the two took an oath, Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi took to his social media handle and tweeted a post for the CM, it read, "Congratulations to @Dev_Fadnavisji and @AjitPawarSpeaksji on taking oath as the CM and Deputy CM of Maharashtra respectively. I am confident they will work diligently for the bright future of Maharashtra."</p>
