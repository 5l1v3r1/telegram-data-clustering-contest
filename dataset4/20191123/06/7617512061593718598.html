      <h1>Shedding turf a first, says sports-field firm</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Watts</a></address>
      <p>An official with AstroTurf, the firm behind a sports field at Oak Bay High School that’s shedding plastic grass blades, says the company has never encountered the problem before.</p>
      <p>Ben Houta, managing director of AstroTurf West Distributors, said his firm has 90 per cent of the market in B.C., and before Oak Bay High School, none had shed their artificial grass.</p>
      <p>“Has this ever happened to us before? No, it has not,” said Houta in an interview Friday from Vancouver.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the Greater Victoria School District covered and closed the three-year-old field, which was shedding large amounts of artificial-grass strands into the environment, including nearby Bowker Creek.</p>
      <p>School district maintenance workers have cleaned up most of the strands that migrated off the pitch, said Angus Matthews, a retired college administrator who alerted the district about the problem last week after picking up strands of green plastic 60 metres from the field, on the banks of Bowker Creek and on the beach near the creek mouth.</p>
      <p>Oak Bay municipal workers have installed screens over storm drains to catch any more.</p>
      <p>Houta said his firm has examined pieces of the Oak Bay field and found that for some reason, the grass is not adhering to its backing. As a result, his company will replace the soccer pitch at no cost to the school district.”</p>
      <p>Neither the University of Victoria nor the City of Victoria, both of which have playing fields with manufactured surfaces, report any problems like the one at Oak Bay High.</p>
      <p>Despite the shedding problem, the Oak Bay field has surpassed expectations as a playing surface, said the head of the minor soccer association that uses the field as its primary home.</p>
      <p>Bays United Football Club paid $500,000 — one third of the cost — to install the soccer pitch at Oak Bay High during the school’s renovation. The club lobbied for the newly developed field material, considered superior in performance to its predecessors.</p>
      <p>“If we were going to do it again, we would go for the same thing,” said Howard McElderry, president of Bays United. “We absolutely love this field.”</p>
      <p>Houta said the material has been in use in Europe for about seven years, but has only recently entered North America.</p>
      <p>AstroTurf playing surfaces typically consist of artificial grass strands attached to a backing, with crumbs of ground rubber, usually recycled tires, between the blades.</p>
      <p>But the Oak Bay field uses a newly developed material for its infill, resulting in a field billed as being more durable and providing better shock absorption for players and good bounce for a ball. The material doesn’t have the same electrostatic qualities as rubber, so less of it is tracked off the field on shoes and clothing.</p>
      <p>Perhaps most important from the standpoint of players, the newly developed infill material absorbs and radiates considerably less heat.</p>
      <p>“If you go out on a black, crumb-rubber field, it’s just really hot,” McElderry said. “You can even see ripples from the heat wave.”</p>
      <p>McElderry said his association estimates it would take six natural grass fields to provide the same level of use as one artificial pitch. Natural fields require time for grass to grow back and earth to resettle.</p>
      <p>“This time of year when everything is moist, natural grass gets ripped up pretty quickly,” he said.</p>
      <p>Bays United is working with other associations and groups to find replacement fields, now that the Oak Bay pitch is out of commission, McElderry said.</p>
