      <h1>Ballarat bushire season | CFA members speak after trying day of fires</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Hopkins</a></address>
      <p>After upwards of 50 hectares burnt north of Clunes and more than 15 other fires raged around the rest of the region on Thursday, the question has to be asked: is Ballarat ready for fire season?</p>
      <p>The fires were a result of a perfect storm of high winds and hot weather that turned countless controlled burn-offs, some of which had been undertaken more than three weeks ago, into potentially dangerous bushfires.</p>

          <b>Ballarat's day of chaos: wind and fires wreak havoc</b>

      </p>
      <p>CFA District 15 operations manager Gavin Hope said Thursday should act as a wake up call for people to extinguish their burn-offs properly.</p>
      <p>"A number of these fires were actually from many weeks ago that had been smouldering under the surface of the ground," he said.</p>
      <p>"In those situations you need to fully extinguish the fire with water... the only time you should be burying the ash from a blaze is when you've got no access to water."</p>
      <p>One region which has thrived thanks to well timed and well executed burn-offs is Cape Clear, whose captain Michael Rowe literally wrote the book on the technique.</p>

      <p>Mr Rowe, who authored <i>The Art of Roadside Burning</i> in 2014, said when used properly by experience fire crews, roadside burning can drastically reduce the impact of a bushfire.</p>
      <p>"We've turned roads that were once a concern into a vital tool in fighting fires in the area," he said.</p>
      <p>"Because we've stressed cleaning up our roadsides, the community has started to pitch in and help our by doing their part and keeping their blocks generally clear."</p>
      <p>Looking at how the community prepares for the fire season, Mr Hope said he has been generally impressed with the way in which people within his district, comprised of Ballarat, Moorabool, Golden Plains and Hepburn, are aware of incoming weather conditions.</p>
      <p>"I think most people in our area are on top of the weather generally and that's really important in keeping safe on dangerous days like Thursday," he said.</p>
      <p>"If you see a day like that coming up, it never hurts to put some extra water on areas you have burnt out just to be safe."</p>
      <p>Looking at how well members of the community prepare for fire season, a trio from the Newlyn-Dean Fire Brigade say it can be frustrating to see properties with dangerous levels of growth.</p>
      <p>Fire captain Ian Smith, lieutenant Darryl Williams and senior firefighter Peter Collocott say it's difficult to drive around their area seeing potential fire dangers being ignored by residents.</p>
      <p>"It's terribly frustrating to see... if fire gets into some of the blocks around here it will just take off," Mr Collocott said.</p>
      <p>"There are spots where we know people have heaps of cars stacked up or lots of petrol stored. Those situations are scary, we had an incident in Creswick a few years ago where a person has been storing petrol canisters in a van... when a fire came through the whole thing just blew up."</p>
      <blockquote>We were lucky none of us were killed<cite>Newlyn-Dean firefighter Peter Collocott</cite></blockquote>
      <p>"It's really important that the people in the district keep their own blocks clean and do their own preparation... the CFA can't be at every house in the district if a bushfire comes through." Mr Williams added.</p>
      <p>In an effort to help people be better prepared, the Newlyn-Dean Fire Brigade are holding an open day on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Taking place at the fire station, Mr Collocott said talking one on one and meeting with community members is a crucial part of country firefighting and could potentially lead to more members signing on as volunteers.</p>
      <p>"People see us, they see the trucks are manned and they think 'oh they don't need more members,' but that's just not the case," he said.</p>
      <p>"Opportunities like this weekend are pretty critical for us... you need to establish who you are and how you operate so that when you work with community members it can be as efficient and safe as possible."</p>

      <p>Mr Williams added bringing in younger members is always important as the average age of fire crews from across the region continues to trend upwards.</p>
      <p>"Statistically the number of members has gone down, some of the smaller brigades around here are really struggling for members... they're at the 'dad's army' stage," he said.</p>
      <p>Due to the increase in age, Mr Williams said it becomes more important for neighbouring crews to be prepared to work closely together.</p>
      <p>"Having a close relationship with your neighbouring brigades is critical for us. We share resources and send members to help each other... every time a firefighter goes out, we expect them to come home."</p>
      <p>Despite dropping numbers of volunteers, CFA crews from across the district were able to quickly and safely bring Thursday's Mt Glasgow blaze under control.</p>
      <p>More than 50 units were dispatched to the fire, all prepared the worst as they entered difficult conditions.</p>
      <p>Mr Hope said while the district's fire danger period doesn't start until December 9, everyone is ready for what is coming due to the catastrophic fires burning across New South Wales.</p>
      <blockquote>We've done all our normal preparations but I think what has happened in New South Wales has really got everyone up and about heading into the warmer months.<cite>CFA District 15 operations manager Gavin Hope</cite></blockquote>
      <p>"It's helped us get a jump-start on our season... people are hands on ready to go."</p>
