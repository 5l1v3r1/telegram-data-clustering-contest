      <h1>Pagalpanti Box Office Day 1 (Early Trends): Evening Shows Held Up Well, But Is It Enough?</h1>
      <h2>Given the genre, this wasn't even expected to open well among the critics, but the sad part is even the word of mouth seems to be not inclining towards the film.</h2>

      <p><b><i><a href="https://www.koimoi.com/reviews/pagalpanti-move-review-only-thing-missing-from-this-comedy-is-fun/">Pagalpanti</a></i> Box Office Day 1 (Early Trends):</b> This John Abraham, Anil Kapoor, Arshad Warsi led comic-caper didn’t really open as the makers wanted it to. Given the genre, this wasn’t even expected to open well among the critics, but the sad part is even the word of mouth seems to be not inclining towards the film.</p>
      <p>Even the pre-release buzz of the film wasn’t favourable enough, and now the first-day figures are worrisome too. The movie is mounted on a decent budget. It’s to be seen how well does it hold over the weekend. The real test of the film will start from Monday but let’s see how well it has fared on its day 1.</p>

      <p>As per the early trends flowing in, <i>Pagalpanti</i> has earned in the range of <b>6-7 crores</b> at the box office. It opened to an average morning occupancy of <b>10-15%</b>. But, thankfully it wasn’t a crash and some shows held up towards the evening.</p>
      <p>This is still a below-expectations opening for the film, as it needed to open in double digits. Apart from John Abraham, Anil Kapoor &amp; Arshad Warsi, <i>Pagalpanti</i> also stars Pulkit Samrat, Saurabh Shukla, Ileana D’Cruz, Kriti Kharbanda, and Urvashi Rautela.</p>
      <p>Director Anees Bazmee has helmed several comedy films such as <i>No Entry</i> (2005), <i>Welcome</i> (2007), <i>Singh Is Kinng</i> (2008), <i>Ready</i> (2011) and <i>Welcome Back</i> (2015). All along, he has avoided the Bollywood tendency to utilise dialogues and songs with a double meaning to create humour. “I don’t have any objection with double meaning dialogues that are being written in other films, but personally I feel if you have a pen, you have some sort of skill and intelligence and if you are ready to do some hard work, then you don’t need to find these short cuts. I always write my films keeping in mind that kids are going to watch my films,” he recently said.</p>
      <p><i>Pagalpanti</i> revolves around three men, considered losers by all, who plan to get rich along with their girlfriends by fooling two gangsters and robbing their money.</p>
