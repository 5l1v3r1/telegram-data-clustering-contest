      <h1>Maharashtra: Ajit Pawar a traitor, split both party, family, says NCP’s Supriya Sule</h1>
      <h2>Talking to The Indian Express, Sule said, "My father Sharad Pawar is not with Ajit Pawar anymore.”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:38:23+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/anuradha-mascarenhas/" target="_blank">Anuradha Mascarenhas</a></address>
      <p>“Ajit Pawar turned out to be a traitor,” the NCP leader’s cousin and party chief Sharad Pawar’s daughter Supriya Sule told <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a> on Saturday hours after <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/devendra-fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis</a> took oath as the Maharashtra Chief Minister along with Ajit as his deputy. “There is a split in both the family and the party,” the Baramati MP added.</p>
      <p>In her earlier interviews with The Indian Express, Sule was always vocal about how Sharad Pawar, `the warrior’, had fought back and how honesty, hard work and dedication to the right cause of elections had worked in the party’s favour.</p>

      <p>Every NCP worker had stood by them in `difficult’ times when they had braved defections across the state, and hence this move by Ajit Pawar to join hands with the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> has come as a huge shock, Sule said.</p>

      <p>“My father Sharad Pawar is not with Ajit Pawar anymore,” the NCP leader said.</p>
      <p>Sule has been the star campaigner of the NCP and had also lashed out at the BJP earlier for indulging in `vindictive’ politics to create panic and fear among the people.</p>
      <p>NCP MLAs have now decided to hold a meeting at 4.30 pm today to discuss the future course of action.</p>
