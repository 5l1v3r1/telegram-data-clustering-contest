      <p>Kate Middleton won several hearts as she donned various eastern outfits from different designers on her trip to Pakistan. However, more than her looks, the Duchess of Cambridge was appreciated for her etiquette – and now it has been revealed that she sent a heartfelt letter to Elan’s creative director, Khadijah Shah, for one of her much-revered attires.</p>
      <p>The Duchess of Cambridge, 38, penned a note appreciating the director’s effort into the outfits and revealed plans to return to the country. </p>

      <p>The royal mother-of-three, wore a black and white embroidered kurta last month to play cricket during a visit to the SOS Village in Lahore. Now, fashion designer Khadijah shared on <a href="https://twitter.com/khadijah_shah?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Twitter</a> a picture of the personal thank-you letter, on Kensington Palace-headed paper, that she received from Kate.</p>
      <p>The Duchess wrote: “Thank you so much for all of your help ahead of my tour to Pakistan. I am so grateful to you and your team for the wonderful selection you made for me to choose from – although having so many beautiful things did make decision making a little more difficult!”</p>

      <p>“I loved the outfit I wore, so thank you for all your time and effort. Pakistan really is a wonderful country, which we both thoroughly enjoyed visiting and hope to return to one day soon. This comes with my warmest thanks and best wishes.”</p>
      <p>Khadijah captioned her post with adding, “I was delighted to have even been considered, this is just humbling to a whole different level. However what’s most commendable is the consideration, grace and thoughtfulness of HRH the Duchess Catherine, it is no wonder that she is so respected and beloved.”</p>

      <p>It is possible that Kate came across her work ahead of the tour, given that Khadijah set up her fashion label after completing a degree at the London School of Economics.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the designer had shared how grateful she was when the Duchess wore one of her ensembles, “We are absolutely thrilled with how elegantly she carried it, and grateful for this privilege and honour.”</p>
