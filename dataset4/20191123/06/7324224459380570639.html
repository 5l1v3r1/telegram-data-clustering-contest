      <h1>'Not enough people are listening': Boxing club launches men's mental health podcast</h1>
      <h2>Members of a Black Country boxing club have launched a podcast tackling men's mental health.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:02:30+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/jamie-brassington/" target="_blank">Jamie Brassington</a></address>
      <p>The four hosts are fighting the corner of men who struggle to speak about their problems.</p>
      <p>Each of the men are members of Lions Boxing Club, Brierley Hill, with Kev Dhillon, the owner, Lee Cadman, a boxing coach, and Aren Dew and Craig Pinches.</p>
      <p>Kev, 37, from Kingswinford, who came up with the podcast idea, said: "People are saying men should be talking more about their mental health.</p>
      <p>"But the problem is not enough people are listening."</p>
      <p>The boxing world has a number of high profile figures who have spoken publicly about their mental health, including Tyson Fury.</p>
      <p>However having "average blokes", as Lee puts it, may be more effective in helping men to speak out.</p>
      <p>Lee, 36, from Kingswinford, said: "Although they are speaking out, people can't relate to the Tyson Furys of this world, whereas me and Kev are everyday blokes."</p>
      <p>Kev lost most of his vision aged just three after suffering meningitis and at the age of 11, he could no longer box, which was his passion.</p>
      <p>He said this "sent him off the rails" and he has suffered anxiety as a result. But he got into coaching aged 18 and went on to open his own gym.</p>
      <p>Lee has suffered with depression due to illnesses suffered by his five-year-old daughter Calla-Rose. She has a rare form of epilepsy, called Dravet Sybdrome, and stage one kidney failure.</p>
      <p>For Kev and Lee, being able to talk about their problems has helped them out.</p>
      <p>"The more I spoke out, the better I felt," said Kev.</p>
      <p>He added: "Us four blokes can't stop cancer but we can help men to talk about mental health."</p>
      <p>The podcast has a seen a number of interesting guests appear on the show said Kev.</p>
      <p>One is a member of the travelling community while another was a boxing member of the gym, who went to prison over drugs, but turned to religion while inside bars.</p>
      <p>The podcast, called <a href="https://shows.pippa.io/bcb">Chewing The Fat with the Black Country Blokes</a>, is available on Spotify and YouTube and has a growing audience.</p>
