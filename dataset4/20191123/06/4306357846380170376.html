      <h3>Mark Lawrenson is backing Liverpool FC to edge past Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Saturday afternoon.</h3>
      <p>The Reds are sitting eight points clear at the top of the Premier League table after a 3-1 victory over defending champions Manchester City last time out.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC have a nearly flawless record in the Premier League this season after recording 11 victories and one draw in their opening 12 top-flight fixtures.</p>
      <p>Only Manchester United have managed to deny Liverpool FC three points after Adam Lallana scored a late goal to rescue a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford last month.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC will taken on a Crystal Palace side that suffered a 2-0 loss to Chelsea FC at Stamford Bridge in their last Premier League fixture before the international break.</p>
      <p>Roy Hodgson’s side have failed to win their last four top-fight games, dropping them down to 15th place in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Former Liverpool FC defender Lawrenson is backing the Reds to secure a 2-0 win against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>“This game sees Crystal Palace Roy Hodgson boss up against his former club, and it is the sort of test he relishes,” Lawrenson told <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/50490801">BBC Sport</a>.</p>
      <p>“Hodgson’s sides are very good at soaking up pressure and hitting teams on the break, but my worry for them here is that they do not have enough firepower to hurt Liverpool.</p>
      <p>“I am sure Hodgson will set up his side to make things very difficult for the Reds, and it might be a tighter game than some people might think – but I just do not see Palace holding out.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC finished in second place in the Premier League table last season to narrowly miss out on the top-flight crown.</p>
      <p>The Reds only lost one game in the Premier League last term – a 2-1 defeat at Manchester City.</p>
