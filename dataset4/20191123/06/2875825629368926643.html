      <h1>Political vandal arrested for tearing down candidate posters in Fingal, Dublin</h1>
      <h2>Exclusive: Gardai watched him cut down one poster and then followed him as he made his way by bicycle to another location</h2>

      <p>A political vandal has been arrested for tearing down candidate posters.</p>
      <p>Gardai nabbed the man after he had already damaged up to 50 posters in the Dublin Fingal by-election constituency on Friday night.</p>
      <p>The cops watched him cut down one poster with pincers, then followed him as he made his way by bicycle to another location where he was at it again with the snippers.</p>
      <p>They subsequently moved in and arrested him, detained him and questioned him at Balbriggan Garda station.</p>
      <p>The gardai established that the man was acting alone through questioning, but they found out that he had already done 50 posters.</p>

      <p>Most of the posters were left hanging dangerously in the wind, with the potential to cause accidents for motorists or injure pedestrians.</p>
      <p>Tearing down the posters of rivals is generally regarded as part of the rough and tumble of electioneering – but nobody ever gets caught.</p>
      <p>This is the first time in a long time anyone in political circles can remember somebody actually getting nicked for the offence.</p>
      <p>Labour hopeful Duncan Smith was one of those targeted and he told the Irish Mirror that he isn’t bothered personally at being attacked – it means he’s doing well in the race.</p>

      <p>But he said that the “malicious” acts have left posters half-hanging and posing dangers to the general public.</p>
      <p>He said: “I got a call from the gardai to tell me that I was one of the candidates that has been targeted by a vandal.</p>
      <p>“This type of behavior is part of what you’d expect, I wouldn’t be too upset myself.</p>
      <p>“But this was a particularly malicious act, there were over 50 posters damaged and they were left hanging dangerously for the most part.</p>
      <p>“He seems not to have snipped the last cable tie, so they are left swinging.</p>
      <p>“I have a team out tidying them up at the moment.</p>
      <p>“People might say it’s a bit of horseplay, but it’s obviously dangerous too and I suppose I’d just like to warn people of that.”</p>
      <p>The other candidates targeted in the vandal’s campaign were Lorraine Clifford-Lee of Fianna Fail and Fine Gael’s James Reilly.</p>
