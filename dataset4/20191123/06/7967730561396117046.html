      <h1>Rudan hopes away trip will spur urgent start</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:11:32+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:11</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Lynch</a></address>
      <p>Western United boss Mark Rudan has several times lamented his team's inability to get going early in games this season but, against a side that has conceded in its past 38 competitive matches, the A-League's newest club should be able to get on the scoresheet at least once when it travels to Central Coast to face the Mariners for the first time on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Both teams have had some very bright results this season. The Mariners' victory over Perth Glory in Western Australia three weeks ago should have been the one that ignited their season, while Western's win over Melbourne Victory, after going 2-0 down inside 10 minutes, was the sort of triumph that really helps a club build its identity.</p>

      <p>However, the Mariners have lost their two subsequent games, away to Melbourne City and home to Adelaide.<br/>Western beat West Sydney at their temporary home in Geelong the week after defeating Victory, but they lost at the same venue, 1-0 to Newcastle Jets, last week in a game in which they had a penalty appeal rejected and a goal disallowed through the VAR.</p>
      <p>Aside from their opening day win on the road (a 1-0 victory in Wellington), United have not left Victoria since, so this will be their first foray into NSW.</p>
      <p>Rudan is hoping that the chance to go on the road and bond together as a team might help Western bounce back after the Jets loss - and start games quicker.</p>

      <p>"We need to start better and we have been saying that for the past few weeks," he said.</p>
      <p>"The second half [against Newcastle] was good, we dominated completely, we had all the ball and all the chances. We did everything but score, but certainly our starts have to be better."</p>
      <p>Travelling away might be the circuit breaker.</p>
      <p>"It could do the world of good for us, it's been a really good training week for us," he said.</p>
      <p>"It's a different environment. I tried something different last week and didn't talk about the slow starts. It's more mental than anything else. They need to find within themselves to start well. They prepare well, warm-up well."</p>
      <p>Western captain Alessandro Diamanti is one of the most exciting players in the league. He has had 20 shots from outside the box this season and is certainly not afraid to try his luck from anywhere within range.</p>

      <p>If he and Besart Berisha, along with veteran Scott McDonald, can impose themselves on this match early they might be able to get back onto the winning track.</p>
      <p>"It's not like we are not creating chances ... we haven't done things that are adverse to our philosophy, we haven't panicked, and we will continue to trust in our methods of play," Rudan said. 'The positives far outweigh the negatives."</p>
      <p>The Mariners will look to new Brazilian signing Jair to help boost their firepower. The former Newcastle Jets striker trained with the club for several weeks before signing for Alen Stajcic a few days ago.</p>
      <p>"Itâ€™s a challenge to face Western United, but I am here for that. I have been [away] from my country for 10 years, I am 31 and I believe that I can help with scoring some goals," Jair said.</p>
