      <p>Brothers Josh and Nate Pierre-Louis combined for 22 points as Temple used a strong second-half surge to earn a 70-61 victory over Southern California in an Orlando Invitational game at Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Josh Pierre-Louis, a freshman, scored 15 points, including 13 in the first half, while junior Nate Pierre Louis had seven points and 10 rebounds, missing out on a double-double for the first time this season for the Owls (4-0).</p>
      <p>Quinton Rose and De’Vondre Perry scored 12 points each as Temple used a 19-2 run midway through the second half to overcome a seven-point deficit with 17 minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>Onyeka Okongwu scored 17 points and Ethan Anderson added 12 for the Trojans (5-1), who have played all but one game at home so far this season.</p>
      <p>USC and Temple will continue Orlando Invitational play on Thanksgiving Day in Florida.</p>
      <p>The Owls took a 31-30 halftime lead on a Josh Pierre-Louis reverse layup at the first-half buzzer. The Trojans opened the second half on an 8-0 run to lead 38-31 with 17:10 left.</p>
      <p>Temple’s 19-2 run started with a 13-0 stretch that was capped by a 3-pointer from Rose. Three more baskets inside followed after a bucket from Okongwu, the third one from Rose as the Owls led 53-42.</p>
      <p>Temple held off a late USC push and hit four free throws in the final 42 seconds to seal the victory in their first game outside of Philadelphia this season. It was the Owls’ first visit to California in 14 years.</p>
      <p>USC’s second-leading scorer and leading rebounder Nick Rakocevic was held to six points and six boards in 25 minutes. He was 2 of 7 from the field and 1 of 6 from the free-throw line.</p>
      <p>Justyn Hamilton scored 10 points for Temple, which had a 42-38 rebounding advantage and led 21-8 on points in the paint.</p>
