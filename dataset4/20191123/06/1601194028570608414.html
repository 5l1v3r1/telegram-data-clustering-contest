New additions included four rookies and the free agent acquisition of Jimmy Butler by sign and trade with the Philadelphia 76ers. At the moment, the changes have been good for the Miami Heat who are 11-3 to start this season.</p>
      <p>Last night, they procured their 11th win in a 116-108 victory over the Bulls for their fifth road victory of the year. Miami is now 9-1 in their last 10 games and arrives in Philadelphia on a five-game winning streak.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/jimmy-butler">Jimmy Butler</a> has come a long way since he was drafted in the 2011 NBA Draft’s first round. He is a 6’7 small forward/shooting guard who has significant value in the modern style of the game as he is a clutch shooter from long-range and can defend multiple positions.</p>
      <p>He is, for the moment, has a three point accuracy of 29%. On Friday night, Butler scored 27 points, dished out 7 assists and grabbed 5 rebounds in Miami’s victory over the Chicago Bulls.</p>
      <h4>Heat’s predicted lineup</h4>
      <p>Jimmy Butler, Kendrick Nunn, Ducan Robinson, Myers Leonard, Bam Adebayo</p>
      <h3>Philadelphia 76ers Preview</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/philadelphia-76ers">Philadelphia 76ers</a> are expected to be a serious contender for the Eastern Conference Title in 2020. They have started this season respectably with a 10-5 record. Friday night, they beat the San Antonio Spurs 115-104.</p>
      <p>The 76ers were led by Tobias Harris’ 26 points, a double-double by Joel Embiid with 21 points and 14 rebounds, and a Ben Simmons triple-double with 10 points, 13 assists, and 10 rebounds. The 76ers are perfect at home this season, at 6-0, and have won three straight games.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/tobias-harris">Tobias Harris</a> was a key acquisition by Philadelphia general manager Elton Brand last season in a deal worked out with the LA Clippers. Harris re-signed during the off-season and is again a significant contributor to the 76ers’ on-court success this campaign. He is the team's second-leading scorer averaging 17.4 points per game and is shooting at an accuracy of 48.7 percent this season.</p>
      <h4>76ers’ predicted lineup</h4>
      <p>Ben Simmons, Furkan Korkmaz, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid, Al Horford</p>
      <h3>Heat vs 76ers Match Prediction</h3>
      <p>The 76ers were hot on Friday night in their win over San Antonio as they shot 51. 7 percent for the game. Also, they recorded 32 assists and 46 field goals, led by Ben Simmons with 10. Philadelphia will also likely be without Josh Richardson who is out with a hip injury.</p>
      <p>The Miami Heat was also making all the right passes as they recorded 33 assists on their 39 field goals made. However, they will need to value their possessions as they turned the ball over 19 times against the Bulls.</p>
      <p>Miami will need to do a better job of defending the painted area as they were outscored 58-44 in the paint by Chicago, Friday night. Their opponents on Saturday, Philadelphia, is sixth in the NBA averaging 51.7 points in the paint per game.</p>
      <p>The 76ers should extend their home winning streak to seven games.</p>
