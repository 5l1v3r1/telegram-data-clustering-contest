      <h1>Ally Graham on epic Celtic cup shock as he relives moment he thought Raith's dream had died</h1>
      <h2>Gordan Dalziel forced extra time with a late equaliser as Raith recorded a historic 6-5 win on penalties.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Ralston, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gary-ralston/</a></address>
      <p>Ally Graham can still remember placing the ball on the centre circle at Ibrox and admitting <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/raith-rovers-fc">Raith</a> were doomed.</p>
      <p>Three quarters of the stadium was bouncing as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> fans celebrated their second goal in the 1994 Coca Cola Cup Final.</p>
      <p>The Barren Years, as they had been christened by Hoops fans, were surely coming to an end that November afternoon as they neared the end of their first cup final since 1990.</p>
      <p>They had been without a trophy since the year before, when Joe Miller won them the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-cup">Scottish Cup</a> against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a>, and Charlie Nicholas looked to have written a fresh chapter in their history under new boss Tommy Burns.</p>
      <p>His first-time volley from six yards, after Andy Walker’s shot had cracked the inside of the post, left Scott Thomson helpless and Celtic on the brink of glory with just six minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>Graham was a Celtic fan as a kid, raised in the heartlands of Roystonhill where he was once shot with an air gun for having the audacity to wear a Boys’ Brigade cap.</p>

      <p>This time, it was Nicholas who had taken aim with that shot straight to the heart of his dreams of a first major honour.</p>
      <p>Graham said: “I put the ball down for the restart and said to Daz (Gordon Dalziel), ‘So close.’</p>
      <p>“He was having none of it. He was adamant the game wasn’t finished, we would create one more chance to score.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t full of optimism when Jason Dair took the ball on the right wing two minutes later and cut inside.</p>
      <p>“See when he shot? You know my original reaction? ‘For f***’s sake.’ There was no weight in his effort at all but big Gordon Marshall fumbled and Daz nipped in to nod the ball into an empty net – the rest is history.”</p>
      <p>Dair will be ribbed mercilessly tomorrow, no doubt, while the distance of Dalziel’s equaliser will surely have been extended by a yard for every one of the 25 years that have passed since Rovers’ most famous victory.</p>
      <p>Jimmy Nicholl’s squad will gather for a brunch with fans at the Strathearn Hotel in Kirkcaldy ahead of the formal anniversary on Wednesday, feasting on more than bacon rolls as they recall their famous 6-5 penalty victory.</p>
      <p>Graham, 53, was the team’s targetman and if letters stick to his fingers over the next couple of weeks in his job at the Royal Mail as easily as the ball once nestled in his size 11s then Santa won’t be receiving much post from East Kilbride this festive season.</p>
      <p>He still carries himself with the power of a man who ruffled defences all over the Scottish leagues, from Clydebank and Ayr to Motherwell, Falkirk, Partick and Raith, via a couple of stints at Albion Rovers, where he continues to coach the strikers.</p>
      <p>His peak years traversed the Bosman era that cost him the chance to make the money his talent deserved but he’s rich in memory and that season, 1994-95, remains his Aladdin’s cave of adventure.</p>
      <p>He scored five goals in the cup run, which also included victories over Ross County, Kilmarnock, St Johnstone and Airdrie, as First Division Rovers also romped to the title and returned to the top flight of Scottish football.</p>

      <p>He said: “Jimmy Nic started a players’ committee the season before with guys such as Jock McStay and Peter Hetherston and we continued it into the following campaign.</p>
      <p>“I once met Brian Hamilton at Hearts and he said he’d love to be a Rovers player because nights out at the Jambos attracted five players. We turned up with 26.</p>
      <p>“Jimmy brought in guys who gelled and got along, with the exception of David Narey, who stayed in his room a lot. Narey? What a player, what a professional. Mind you, we left without him on the team bus before the quarter final at St Johnstone.</p>
      <p>“Our most experienced player and he was given a lift to the ground by the chef from the hotel.</p>
      <p>“The hotel was haunted, by the way. I was rooming with Daz and Davie Kirkwood and the barman asked who was staying in Room 12.</p>
      <p>“That was our room and he told us the previous owner had taken his life there and his spirit continued to haunt the place. Davie went out like a light but Daz and I didn’t sleep a wink.”</p>

      <p>Reserve keeper Brian Potter emerged the hero in the semi-final victory over Airdrie, saving Alan Lawrence’s spot kick as 10-man Rovers progressed to Ibrox despite the earlier dismissal of Thomson.</p>
      <p>Graham recalled: “We went up Jackie O’s that night and they wouldn’t let Brian in because he was only 17. We had to have a whip round for his taxi fare home.</p>
      <p>“He played a vital role in the final too. He unnerved Alan Lawrence in the semi-final shoot-out by throwing the ball to him high, giving him an extra few seconds to think about what was coming.</p>
      <p>“Scott did the same with Paul McStay in the final but we couldn’t see him make the save from the centre circle because of the camber of the pitch. It was only the reaction of the Celtic fans behind that goal that let us know we’d won it.”</p>
      <p>The rest of the night was a blur as the team returned to a Kirkcaldy hotel and partied in a manner only Prince could have envisaged, and not until another five years down the line.</p>
      <p>The win qualified Rovers for Europe but that’s another story as early-round wins in the Faroes and Iceland took them to one of the summits of the world game at Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>Graham said: “They were great memories but my only regret is we didn’t play the final that year at Hampden because of stadium redevelopment.”</p>
