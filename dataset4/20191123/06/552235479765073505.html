      <h1>Jack Ross to take the Aiden McGeady and Lewis Morgan approach to Scott Allan at Hibs</h1>
      <h2>There are some players that need the freedom to go and express themselves and Ross believes Allan falls in to that bracket</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Pilcher, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-pilcher/</a></address>
      <p>Jack Ross is well placed to get the best out of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> talisman Scott Allan because he’s done it before with his “match winners” at other clubs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-allan">Allan</a> returned to Easter Road for a third spell in the summer after signing a pre-contract agreement back in January, agreed while Neil Lennon was still in charge.</p>
      <p>He subsequently left and returned to Celtic – alongside Allan – but there was no question of the midfielder reversing his decision to return to Leith, and he met with Paul Heckingbottom before officially becoming a Hibs player again.</p>
      <p>The initial signs were good as Allan netted a late winner on the opening day of the season against St Mirren, suggesting he was set to be a key man for the Hibees once again.</p>
      <p>Despite coming in a 6-1 defeat to Rangers and Ibrox and the reaction to it being the subject of some mickey taking, his through pass for Daryl Horgan’s consolation in that game was indeed impressive.</p>
      <p>There have been bad days at the office as well though, although not always entirely Allan’s doing.</p>
      <p>His now infamous substitution in a home draw against St Johnstone came after an ineffective display, although the fact that Heckingbottom had been playing him on the right of midfield was a contributing factor.</p>
      <p>When he was withdrawn in favour of Daryl Horgan with Hibs 2-1 up, the boos rang down from the Easter Road stands.</p>
      <p>A last minute Saints equaliser before Heckingbottom responded to questions over his decision to replace Allan with: “I didn’t know there was a rule against taking him off” did not improve the situation.</p>
      <p>Playing Allan in his favoured position and giving him the freedom to go and play can result in goals like we saw in Hibs’ last outing, also against St Johnstone.</p>
      <p>Allan picked up a loose pass on half way and drove at the St Johnstone defence before finding the far corner to put Hibs 3-0 up in Perth.</p>
      <p>It’s those sort of big moments that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Ross</a> will endeavour to get from Allan on a regular basis, which means setting up in a way that allows him to flourish.</p>
      <p>To do so, he knows that some leeway must be given to those players in the team that can make a difference, in order for them to produce the game changing moments.</p>

      <p>"I've had examples of that with Lewis (Morgan) at St Mirren, Aiden (McGeady) at Sunderland,” Ross explained. “Last season he was terrific for me.</p>
      <p>“Ideally I find a way to get the best from them, because the players that can make the difference in games and match-winners are difficult to come by.</p>
      <p>“Scotty's definitely one of those. I've been really impressed by him this week. Not just on the pitch, but as a young man and speaking to him as well.</p>
      <p>“There's a maturity about him and hopefully I can get the best from him on a consistent basis, because he's absolutely got the quality. Not just on the ball, but his all round application and how he is.</p>
      <p>“If I can get the best from him then he'll be a major asset for us.</p>
      <p>“There are various approaches. I've been fortunate or unfortunate depending on your point of view, with having a squad that's that type in it.</p>
      <p>“You balance out everything else accordingly to make sure you get the best from them.</p>
      <p>“The people at St Mirren would tell you Lewis was allowed to play in a certain way and Aiden last year, because it’s difficult to find that ability to win games.</p>
      <p>“Its about me figuring out as quickly as possible how to get the best from Scotty and others. I'm excited."</p>

      <p>Ross is also looking forward to working with Ryan Porteous. The young centre back was handed first senior call-up to the Scotland squad over the last week, although he didn’t feature in the wins over Cyrpus and Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>That meant a delayed return to training this week, but the pair were able to catch up on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Ross hopes that Porteous can continue to play well enough to remain in contention for Scotland, and revealed that he tried to secure his services while at St Mirren.</p>
      <p>“I think it's fantastic recognition for him and the club, particularly the young players who have progressed through,” he said of the call up.</p>
      <p>“I only met him for the first time on Thursday because of that involvement.</p>
      <p>“I actually tried to bring Ryan to St Mirren on loan a couple of years ago so he's somebody I've been aware of for a long time.</p>
      <p>“Undoubtedly he'll come back from that involvement feeling good about himself.</p>
      <p>“So the challenge for him is to make sure he continues that performance level and the next time Steve [Clarke] names a squad, he finds himself back in it."</p>
