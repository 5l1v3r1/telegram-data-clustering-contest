      <p>There are quite a few gift Pokemons you can get in <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/pokemon-sword-and-shield-where-to-find-all-legendaries">Pokemon Sword and Shield</a>, including your <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/pokemon-sword-and-shield-which-starter-to-pick">starter Pokemon</a>. Another Pokemon you can get for free is Toxel, an Electric/Poison Pokemon. Toxel evolves into Toxtricity which is quite a unique Pokemon with unique abilities and strong move sets.</p>
      <p>Here's how you can get Toxel for free.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to Route 5, just east of Turrfield where the Grass Gym Leader is.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Once you're in Route 5, continue on till you find the Pokemon Day Care. It's a big house with a lady standing outside and 3 eggs on top of the door. You won't miss it.</li>
        <li>Go inside the Day Care and you'll find a lady on the right, before the counter. Talk to her and she will give you a free Toxel!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You will also receive an Exp. Candy XS which gives a Pokemon some Exp. points. It's like a weaker Rare Candy.</p>

      <p>You can also get a free <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/pokemon-sword-and-shield-where-to-get-a-free-pikachu-eevee">Pikachu and Eevee</a> in an early stage in the game, but you will need to have played the Pokemon Let's Go games for that.</p>

      <p>Toxtricity is a good choice to add in your team. It also probably has the best looking Gigantamax form in the game which also has an extremely strong power level. Toxel and Toxtricity are only weak to Ground and Psychic Types and resistant to many other types.</p>
