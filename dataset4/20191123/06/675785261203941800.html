      <h1>How Liverpool blew their title chance five years ago on a trip to Crystal Palace</h1>
      <h2>The Reds led by three before capitulating against the Eagles, handing Man City a crucial boost in the 2013-14 Premier League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:30</time> by <a rel="author">Ned Keating</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> look well on course to end their 30-year wait for a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/premier-league">Premier League</a> title this season, but return this weekend to the scene of a famous capitulation that led to one of several near-misses.</p>
      <p>With just two games to go in the 2013-14 campaign, the Reds and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> found themselves both locked on 80 points in a titanic title tussle.</p>
      <p>In their final away match of the campaign, the Anfield club headed to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> on May 5 knowing a win would pile the pressure on City, who would host <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> two days later.</p>
      <p>Then manager <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> would have pleased at the break at Selhurst Park with Liverpool leading thanks to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/joe-allen">Joe Allen's</a> 18th-minute opener.</p>

      <p>Things got even better for the Reds early in the second half as they scored twice in two minutes through a Damien Delaney own goal and Luis Suarez to move three ahead by the 55th minute.</p>
      <p>All looked to be going swimmingly, with Rodgers' men on course to turn up the heat on City in the final week of the title race.</p>
      <p>However, it all began to unravel 11 minutes from time when Delaney netted again, this time in the Liverpool goal, to offer Palace hope of a comeback, even if it seemed remarkably slim at the time.</p>
      <p>Dwight Gayle then cut the deficit to one in the 81st minute, before devastating everyone associated with the Reds with his second, the equaliser, two minutes from time.</p>

      <p>Come the final whistle, there were scenes that have been become infamous of Liverpool players sinking to their knees in despair, perhaps realising they had blown their title chances.</p>
      <p>Uruguayan forward Luis Suarez was the most emotional, with skipper Steven Gerrard having to usher a cameraman away as he tried to film the striker crying.</p>
      <p>After the game, Rodgers admitted the title was City's to lose and so it proved, with the Etihad Stadium outfit beating Villa later that week before seeing off <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on the final day to lift the trophy.</p>

      <p>For Liverpool, though, it was another case of so near, and yet so far as they sought to end their lengthy wait for another league crown.</p>
      <p>Suarez would go on to depart that summer and the Reds could only muster a sixth-place finish the following campaign, with Rodgers eventually being sacked in October 2015.</p>
      <p>It took Liverpool until last season to truly mount another title challenge and have followed that up again to lead the way this term - it would be a shame now it it were to unravel again because of a trip to Selhurst Park.</p>
