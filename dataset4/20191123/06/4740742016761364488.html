      <h1>The latest urgent product recalls for Waitrose, Cadbury, Asda, Lidl and more</h1>
      <h2>Dozens of products are being recalled</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Briana Millett</a></address>
      <p>Every month the Food Standards Agency (FSA) issues product recalls - and this month has been no different.</p>
      <p>So far in November 2019 dozens of products have been recalled, with reasons ranging from allergy fears to the presence of salmonella or glass.</p>
      <p>In the article below we've rounded up all of the major product recalls issued by the FSA since November 1.</p>
      <p>If you have purchased these products, you are advised not to eat them but to return them for a full refund.</p>
      <p>The brands include Cadbury, while many of the items are sold at supermarkets including Asda, Lidl, Waitrose and more.</p>
      <p>Here's the full list.</p>
      <h3>Waitrose soup</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink/waitrose-uk-food-soup-recall-3562847">Waitrose is recalling its Carrot &amp; Coriander Soup</a> because of undeclared allergens.</p>
      <p>The vegetable soup contains barley and celery, two ingredients which are not included on the other product’s label.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Product details:</b>

      <p>A spokesperson for Waitrose &amp; Partners said: "We are recalling our carrot &amp; coriander soup 600g, use by date 27 November.</p>
      <p>"Some of the pots have been filled with the wrong soup (vegetable soup), which contains gluten (barley) and celery that are not declared on the label.</p>
      <p>"Any customers with an allergy to gluten or celery should not eat the soup.</p>
      <p>"Any customer that has bought the soup please return it to us for a refund. We're very sorry to our customers for this error."</p>
      <p>No other Waitrose products are known to be affected.</p>
      <h3>Spelt &amp; Fruit Cake</h3>
      <p>Welsh Cottage Cakes is recalling its Spelt &amp; Fruit Cake because it contains wheat which is not mentioned on the label. This means the product is a possible health risk for anyone with an allergy or intolerance to wheat or gluten.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Product details:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>

      </figure>
      <p>A Cadbury product is this week being recalled by its parent company Mondelez UK over safety concerns.</p>
      <p>The issue concerns some packs of Dairy Milk Little Robins (93g) which contain undeclared almonds and are therefore a possible health risk for anyone with an allergy to nuts.</p>
      <p>The FSA have revealed the labelling error is due to some of the product having been incorrectly packed with Cadbury Dairy Milk Little Robins Daim Chocolate.</p>
      <p>The affected items have the batch codes of CIS3092812 and CIS3092822, and have a best before date of March 31, 2020.</p>

      <h3>Waitrose desserts</h3>
      <p>Pots &amp; Co. is recalling part of its range of products, which are currently stocked at Waitrose &amp; Partners.</p>
      <p>The manufacturer recently explained that four of its pot varieties may contain pieces of glass, and are therefore unsafe for consumption.</p>
      <p>Colombian Chocolate Pot (65g) which has the identifying barcode of 5060253701920.</p>
      <p>Mango &amp; Passionfruit Pot (65g) which has the identifying barcode of 5060253701906.</p>

      <h3>Brioche Hot Dog Buns</h3>
      <p>La Boulangere is recalling its Brioche Hot-Dog Buns because they contain milk and wheat (gluten) which are not mentioned on the label in English. This means the product is a possible health risk for anyone with an allergy or intolerance to milk or milk constituents or an allergy or intolerance to wheat or gluten.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Product details:</b>
      </p>

      <h3>Houmous Selection - Aldi, Asda, Sainsbury's, Lidl and more</h3>
      <p>Dip maker Zorba Delicacies issued an alert as a "precaution" after an ingredient it uses was found to have the possible presence of salmonella.</p>
