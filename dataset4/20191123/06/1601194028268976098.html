      <p>Former NXT Champion <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/tommaso-ciampa">Tommaso Ciampa</a> has stated that <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/johnny-gargano">Johnny Gargano</a> is the best professional wrestler in the world right now. Speaking to <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/nxt-star-tommaso-ciampa-explains-why-his-recent-injuries-were-blessings-in-disguise">CBS Sports</a>, he praised Gargano for his ability inside the squared circle while claiming that he is more of a sports entertainer.</p>

      <h4>The #DIY connection and a feud to remember</h4>
      <p>Tommaso Ciampa and Johnny Gargano share a lot of history together. They made their debut as a tag team on August 2015 and became one of the most popular teams in NXT before they broke up at NXT TakeOver: Chicago on May 20, 2017, when Ciampa turned on Gargano after losing the NXT Tag Team Championship match against The Authors of Pain.</p>
      <p>Following Ciampa’s betrayal, the two were locked in a feud for the ages which only seemingly ended when Ciampa held the NXT Championship and Johnny Gargano was crowned the NXT North American Champion.</p>

      <h4>Ciampa labels Gargano as the best pro wrestler in the world</h4>
      <p>Gargano is currently recuperating from a neck injury while Tommaso Ciampa is set to lead his team against The Undisputed Era at NXT TakeOver: WarGames on the 23rd of November, 2019.</p>
      <p>Ahead of his match at WarGames, Ciampa spoke to <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/nxt-star-tommaso-ciampa-explains-why-his-recent-injuries-were-blessings-in-disguise">CBS Sports</a> to talk about Johnny Gargano and how he improved Ciampa’s in-ring ability while also stating that he is a sports entertainer while Gargano is a professional wrestler.</p>
      <blockquote>“Johnny Gargano, to me, he’s the best professional wrestler in the world today. No doubt about it. Inside the ring, bell-to-bell, there’s just nobody better. So having him as a teammate for years as part of DIY helped me tremendously.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“It helped me elevate my in-ring game. I just knew the entire time as DIY that I, unlike Johnny Gargano, am a sports entertainer. He’s a professional wrestler. It sounds like it’s the same thing, but it’s slightly different.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“I just knew that I needed a slightly different platform and different stage to highlight all the things I can do, whether it be on the microphone or simply my presence and my aura."</blockquote>
