      <h1>New boss Jose Mourinho likely doesn't know about Troy Parrott says Mick McCarthy</h1>
      <h2>Parrott scored in the Ireland under-21s qualifier win against Sweden on Tuesday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>Mick McCarthy isn't convinced that new Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho is aware of the hugely promising Ireland starlet on the club's books.</p>
      <p>After making his senior international debut in last week's friendly victory over New Zealand, Troy Parrott scored in the Ireland under-21s qualifier win against Sweden on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Still only 17, featured prominently in high-profile games in pre-season for his club.</p>
      <p>But Parrott's only competitive appearance for Spurs so far was the loss on penalties to Colchester in the EFL Cup in September - and this week he was linked with a move to Bayern Munich.</p>

      <p>But the concern is that Mourinho will ignore the claims of young players on the club's books and go with experience as Tottenham look to improve their lowly Premier League status.</p>
      <p>Given Ireland's struggles in front of goal, McCarthy could do with the teenage striker getting regular game time ahead of the Euro 2020 play-offs in March.</p>
      <p>“Well, he (Mourinho) has come in talking about the academy," said McCarthy.</p>
      <p>"So if that’s the case he (Parrott) will be quite pleased, because he will get games.</p>
      <p>"But I bet he [Mourinho] doesn’t know him".</p>
