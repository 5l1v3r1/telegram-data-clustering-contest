      <p>SHAWNEE — In less than two hours Friday afternoon, a Pottawatomie County jury returned verdicts on four aggravating factors and chose the death penalty for Byron James Shepard, the man convicted earlier this week in the 2017 killing of Tecumseh police officer Justin Terney.</p>
      <p>Shepard, 38, of Okemah, had no reaction as the court clerk read the jury's verdict before a packed courtroom that included Terney's family and several area police officers. District Judge John G. Canavan has scheduled formal sentencing for 9 a.m. Jan. 3.</p>
      <p>After Friday's decision, Tecumseh Police Chief J.R. Kidney said he had no words to describe the emotions.</p>
      <p>“The justice system came through for us today. I know that's what the family, I know that's what law enforcement was looking for,” he said. “We all went to the courtroom with a very good feeling and they didn't let us down.”</p>
      <p>Kidney said Terney, who wanted to be a police officer since he was 3 years old, became an officer at age 21 and started living his dream.</p>
      <p>“Less than one year into it, his dream was taken away, so don't let the memory of Justin Terney die. Remember that he was a young man doing what he loved and fighting for his community the night that he died,” Kidney said.</p>
      <p>Terney, 22, died March 27, 2017, from gunshot wounds he suffered the night before in a shootout with Shepard, who was a passenger in a vehicle stopped by Terney that night.Prosecutors argued Shepard, who was a fugitive, shot Terney that night to avoid going to jail. Prosecutors pointed out Shepard's criminal history, as well as past violence and drug use. Shepard's public defenders argued that the shooting and officer's death were unintentional, and asked the jury to spare his life and allow him to spend the rest of his life in prison.</p>
      <p>In the state's closing arguments, Prosecutor Pattye High told the jury they were tasked with deciding the death penalty because of the choices Shepard made that night, which included lying to the officer and giving him a false name before running into a dark treeline.</p>
      <p>“Jail wasn't an option for Byron Shepard on March 26, 2017, and jail is not an option today — sentence him to death,” High said.</p>
      <p>Public Defender Shea Smith told jurors they needed to look at Shepard's entire life and “not just what happened in the field that night.”</p>
      <p>Smith reminded the jury that Shepard has some humanity in him.</p>
      <p>“Send him to prison forever and throw away the key,” Smith said as she asked the jury to spare Shepard from death.</p>
      <p>Several of Terney's family members quietly showed signs of relief as the verdict was read. During the second phase of the trial, Terney's siblings were among those who testified.The jury also found Shepard guilty of knowingly concealing stolen property relating to the stolen firearm used in the homicide, along with a charge of possession of controlled dangerous substance, methamphetamine. Shepard will remain jailed in the Pottawatomie County jail until formal sentencing.Shepard's girlfriend, Brooklyn Danielle Williams, who was driving the vehicle the night of the traffic stop, stood trial this year and was convicted of second-degree murder in Terney's death. She is serving a 25-year prison sentence.</p>
