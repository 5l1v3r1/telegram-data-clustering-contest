      <p>A Derbyshire home could be snapped up for a bargain price at auction next month.</p>
      <p>The end of terrace house <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/swadlincote">in Swadlincote</a> has been listed for auction with SDL Auctions - with a starting price of just £55,000.</p>
      <p>According to Rightmove, the average price of semi-detached properties sold in the town over the past year was £160,833.</p>
      <p>The 'larger-than-average' property could make an ideal family home, with a generously-sized garden, offering the potential for an extention.</p>

      <p>However, pictures show it will require <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/property-news">some improvement</a> before anyone moves in.</p>
      <p>In an online listing for the property, the auctioneers say: "Requiring some improvement and upgrading is a larger than average two double bedroomed end-terraced property with the advantage of a driveway to the side and potential for an extension (subject to planning consent).</p>
      <p>"Internally the property has the benefit of gas central heating and is mostly double glazed and in brief comprises generous sized lounge through diner measuring 27'6" x 13'5", fitted kitchen and walk-in pantry."</p>

      <p>It continues: "To the first floor the passaged leads to two genuine double bedrooms and a spacious bathroom with three piece suite and shower.</p>
      <p>"Outside there is a driveway to the side leading to a good sized enclosed garden enjoying a southerly aspect.</p>
      <p>"The property is situated in the context of an established residential location always popular with first time buyers, young families and landlords.</p>
      <p>"Swadlincote town centre is a short commute along with Burton town centre. Excellent freehold investment opportunity."</p>
      <p>If a bit of home decor doesn't put you off, 78 Regent Street will feature in SDL Auction's upcoming event in Derby on December 13.</p>
      <p>The auction takes place at The Pedigree Suite at Pride Park Stadium, starting at 11:30am.</p>
