      <p>Minutes after <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/devendra-fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis</a> took oath as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/devendra-fadnavis-ajit-pawar-maharashtra-govt-formation-shiv-sena-pm-modi-6132861/"><b>Prime Minister Narendra Modi</b></a> Saturday congratulated him and his deputy NCP’s Ajit Pawar. PM Modi said he was confident the two leaders would work diligently for the future of the state.</p>
      <p>Soon after taking oath as the deputy chief minister, Ajit Pawar said, “From the result day to this day no party was able to form government. Maharashtra was facing many problems including farmer issues, so we decided to form a stable government.”</p>
      <p>In her first reaction, NCP’s Supriya Sule told <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a> that it was a party and family split.</p>
      <p>The development comes a day after the alliance between <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/shiv-sena/">Shiv Sena</a>, NCP and Congress reached a consensus that Uddhav Thackeray would be the new Chief Minister of the state, heading a government of their alliance. NCP chief Sharad Pawar had told reporters, “As far as the Chief Minister’s post goes, there is consensus between the three parties that Uddhav Thackeray will lead the government.”</p>
