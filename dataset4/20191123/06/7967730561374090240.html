      <p><b>Berlin:</b> German Chancellor Angela Merkel's chosen successor as party leader has faced down her political rivals with a defiant performance at her party conference.</p>
      <p>Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, or AKK, appeared to head off a growing rebellion against her leadership of the Christian Democrat party (CDU) by challenging her critics to back her or sack her.</p>
      <p>"If you think that the Germany I want is not the Germany you imagine, if you think that the path I want to walk with you is not the right one, then let's have it out today," she said.</p>
      <p>"Let's end it today. Here and now."</p>

      <p>The response from delegates at the party conference in Leipzig was a seven-minute standing ovation that appeared to silence any challenge to the authority of the woman known as "mini-Merkel" - at least for now.</p>
      <p>Friedrich Merz, the rival who openly advertised his plans to question the party's direction, ended up making a low-key speech pledging his loyalty.</p>

      <p>Michael Kretschmer, a senior delegate, said: "The applause shows today is not an end, Annegret. Today it really gets going."</p>
      <p>It was a rare triumph for AKK, as she likes to be known, who has had a torrid time since taking over as CDU leader a year ago.</p>
      <p>Merkel stepped down from the leadership last year so a new CDU leader could reinvigorate its fortunes following a series of poor election results.</p>
      <p>But the results have only become worse under the leadership of Kramp-Karrenbauer.</p>

      <p>The CDU was beaten into third place by the nationalist Alternative for Germany party (AfD) in regional elections last month, and there have been calls for someone else to take over as the party's chancellor candidate in the next general election.</p>
      <p>Kramp-Karrenbauer, who hoped the party leadership would open the way for her to succeed Merkel in government, has been left fighting for her survival. But she came out fighting in her 90-minute speech on Friday. "These have been 14 good years for Germany, and we all have a lot to be proud of," she said on the 14th anniversary of the day Merkel first became chancellor.</p>
      <p>"As the party that shaped this government, to stand up and say it was all bad is not a successful campaign strategy. We should not get used to it... We have to be careful that such discussions do not lead us to ruin."</p>
      <p>Her remarks were a clear criticism of Merz, who has been absent from politics for most of that time. After losing the leadership to Merkel in 2002, he quit politics in 2009 and only returned with a leadership challenge last year.</p>
      <p>But amid the speculation over Kramp-Karrenbauer's future, Merz has been manoeuvring for position in the party.</p>
      <p>He let it be known that he planned to make an intervention at the conference, but in the event he delivered a low-key address to muted applause.</p>
      <p>"I'm grateful for your brave, combative, forward-looking speech," he told Kramp-Karrenbauer.</p>
      <p>In her speech, Kramp-Karrenbauer called for a new digital ministry and pledged her support for the German carmakers. She said she was pleased Tesla had decided to build its first European factory in Germany, she said, but it was more important to her that cars continue to be built in Stuttgart, Munich and Wolfsburg - the homes of Mercedes, BMW and Volkswagen.</p>
      <p>It was a performance that saw off her rivals for the time being. But Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer needs to improve the CDU's standing in the polls - or Merz and others will be waiting for another chance.</p>
