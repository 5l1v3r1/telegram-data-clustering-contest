      <h1>Rangers stopper Filip Helander highlights key Martin Odegaard Scotland threat</h1>
      <h2>The big defender reckons Scotland will have to be on their guard with the talented Norwegian schemer.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Ralston, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gary-ralston/</a></address>
      <p>Filip Helander has warned <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> to beware Norwegian wonderkid Martin Odegaard.</p>
      <p>The Rangers defender has pinpointed the Real Madrid midfielder, currently on loan at Real Sociedad, as the greatest threat to the Tartan Army’s Euro dream.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> ’s side will face the Norwegians or Serbia away from home if they overcome Israel in the semi-final play-off at Hampden in March.</p>
      <p>Swedish star <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/filip-helander">Helander</a> watched the Norwegians up close and personal during the qualification campaign.</p>
      <p>Sweden qualified for the finals from Group F with Spain and finished four points ahead of Norway, with Helander starring in their 3-0 victory over the Faroes in midweek.</p>
      <p>He said: “Norway are a strong side, a good side. They have a few players who are really good - Odegaard is a bit of a player.</p>
      <p>“It will be a tough game if Scotland end up playing them.”</p>

      <p>Helander won his 11th cap in the 3-0 victory over the Faroes and set up a goal after Janne Andersson’s side successfully sealed qualification for the finals last Friday with a 2-0 win over Romania.</p>
      <p>Helander added: “It was my first game since June. You are always proud to represent your country.</p>
      <p>“It was a game after we had already qualified and we changed a lot of players, but it was a nice experience to play.</p>
      <p>“We had some celebrations in Romania after the game but the manager had already said he would change a lot of players.</p>
      <p>“The ones who didn’t play then knew they could be involved against the Faroes so of course you had to handle it wisely.</p>
      <p>“I’ve always wanted to play at a major finals so hopefully I can increase my chances of playing for Sweden over the next six months at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> .</p>
      <p>“As long as the team is playing well then you look better. Your team-mates feel good and if we can continue as well in Europe then I will have a good chance of showing what I am capable of doing.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully I can show consistency in my game. You don’t want to play well and then have a bad game after three or four good matches so there is more to come not just from me but from everyone in the dressing room.”</p>
