      <h1>John Egan a doubt for Sheffield United's clash with Manchester United</h1>
      <h2>Egan picked up an injury during Monday's Euro 2020 qualifier against Denmark</h2>

      <p>John Egan is a doubt for Sheffield United's Premier League clash with Manchester United tomorrow after suffering concussion on Ireland duty.</p>
      <p>Egan picked up an injury during Monday's Euro 2020 qualifier against Denmark and was forced to come off.</p>
      <p>It is believed that the centre-half, who is enjoying an impressive campaign with the Blades having played in all of the Premier League fixtures to date, is also receiving treatment for a muscle injury.</p>
      <p>"John is in with a chance," said Blades boss Chris Wilder. "We're leaving it until the last minute and we've got to take medical advice on that."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Kieran O'Hara has been praised by Burton Albion boss Nigel Clough for playing his part in the Brewers' FA Cup first round victory over Salford City on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>That was 24 hours after being on Ireland duty at the Aviva Stadium. The Manchester United loanee arrived back at Burton just hours of the replay, which finished 4-1 in the home side's favour.</p>
      <p>“We are very grateful to Mick McCarthy and to Kieran for wanting to come back and play," said Clough.</p>

      <p>“They had had their massive game on Monday night where they were so close to beating Denmark, and then he flies back the next morning and he is ready to play for us.</p>
      <p>“Then he is excited to play and wanting to go. He didn’t have a lot to do but his assurance and his presence when he is in there is growing week-by-week.</p>
      <p>“This is his first season at this level. It was an incredible season he had at Macclesfield, the way he was instrumental in them staying in League Two.</p>
      <p>“He has stepped up now to League One and this is his first experience of it.</p>
      <p>"He is the sort of lad that strikes you that as each challenge comes along - the next level and then the next level - he takes it all in his stride.</p>
      <p>“He’ll embrace it and really look forward to it, and I think that is the way his career is going to go over the next ten years or so".</p>
