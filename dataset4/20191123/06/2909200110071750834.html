      <p>Contrary to assertions that he had run out of the country, leader of the Homeland Study Group Foundation, Charles Kwame Kudzodzi says he is in Ghana and willing to turn himself in if the state invites him appropriately considering his current status.</p>
      <p>Papavi Kudzordzi as he is affectionately called was declared wanted after he declared independence of Western Togoland, a secession from Ghana.</p>
      <p>In a video message from his hideout sighted by <a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/">MyNewsGh.com</a>, the over 80-year-old  said it is wrong for government of Ghana to embark on a needless arrest of people from their homes over the declaration adding that he is not happy his immediate family is being harassed by the government after he was discharged from an initial arrest.</p>
      <p>“Am in the country. I have not gone anywhere but I want the government to show maturity. Invite me legally through my lawyers and I will present myself,” he promised.</p>
      <p>According to him, the declaration was a long awaited one and it was a great achievement for it to have been done.</p>
      <p>He however called for calm among his countrymen while calling on the international community to intervene.</p>
      <p>It would be recalled that the Homeland Study Group Foundation declared independence for the Volta, and parts of the Northern, North Eastern and Upper East Regions after its meeting held in Ho last Sunday.</p>
      <p>But Information Minister, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah in a statement has warned that government will deal with them in accordance with the law.</p>
