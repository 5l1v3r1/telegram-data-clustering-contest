      <h1>Gowran Park betting tips: Peter O'Hehir's picks for Saturday November 23rd</h1>
      <h2>There are seven races this afternoon</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/peter-ohehir/" target="_blank">Peter O'Hehir</a></address>
      <p>The clash of Cheltenham Festival winners Laurina and Minella Indo, on their respective chasing debuts, promises to be the highlight of today’s action in Gowran Park.</p>
      <p>Both Grade 1-winning hurdlers have the scope and potential to make it to the top over the bigger obstacles.</p>
      <p>And, over two and a half miles, I expect the Willie Mullins-trained mare Laurina to prove her star quality by accounting for her ten rivals.</p>
      <p>Beaten only once in seven starts since arriving in Closutton from Guillaume Macaire’s in France, Laurina has won at listed (twice), Grade 3, Grade 2 and Grade 1 level over timber, including a hugely impressive win in the Trull House Mares Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham in 2018, when she bolted-up by 18 lengths from Cap Soleil.</p>
      <p>Her Grade 1 win came at Fairyhouse in her novice season while, last term, she scored effortlessly at Sandown before beating useful stablemate Stormy Ireland at Punchestown.</p>
      <p>Pitched in against the boys in the Unibet Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham and sent off at 5/2, she could finish only fourth (beaten less than 17 lengths) behind ill-fated Espoir D’allen.</p>
      <p>A very exciting chasing recruit and, reportedly, schooling well in recent weeks, Laurina should be very tough to beat and gets the vote to beat Henry de Bromhead’s dour stayer Minella Indo, winner of the Albert Bartlett at Cheltenham before following-up in the Irish Daily Mirror Novice Hurdle at Punchestown.</p>
      <p>But Laurina, better suited by the trip, two and a half miles, might strip fitter and gets the nod.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the Noel Meade-trained Sixshooter, which also holds an engagement in the Monksfield at Navan tomorrow, will be expected to extend his unbeaten record in the Ladbrokes 4-Y-0 Novice Hurdle.</p>
      <p>Winner of good bumpers at both Leopardstown and Punchestown, the Gigginstown-owned gelding scored on his hurdling bow at Punchestown, beating You Raised Me Up, and might have the measure of Tiger Voice and the unexposed pair, Franco de Port and Cayd Boy.</p>
      <p>The Gigginstown colours might also be carried to victory by Gordon Elliott’s Easywork in the INH Stallion Owners Maiden Hurdle.</p>
      <p>This fellow made all to win his bumper at Down Royal three weeks ago, is sure to be well-schooled and is preferred to Mt Leinster.</p>
      <p>And the classy Getabird, successful at Grade 2 over hurdles and runner-up in a Grade 1 novice at Limerick, should be tough to beat in the Talbot Hotel Carlow Chase.</p>
