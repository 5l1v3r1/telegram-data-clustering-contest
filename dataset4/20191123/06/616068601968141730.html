      <p>A B.C. Supreme Court sentencing hearing for former Burns Lake Mayor Luke Strimbold on sexual assault charges will be held Tuesday in Smithers.</p>
      <p>In May, Strimbold pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual assault involving four boys who were under the age of 16. A pre-sentencing report and a psychological assessment were ordered.</p>
      <p>A special prosecutor had previously approved 29 charges against Strimbold, including sexual interference and invitation to sexual touching, that were alleged to have involved six people who were all under the age of 16 at the time.</p>
      <p>An indictment shows the assaults he pleaded guilty to occurred between May 2014 and August 2017.</p>
      <p>In 2011, he became British Columbia's youngest elected mayor when he was elected in Burns Lake, west of Prince George. In September 2016 and part way through his second term, he resigned and in March 2018, Burns Lake RCMP confirmed he had been charged with numerous counts of sexual assault and related offences.</p>
      <p>The hearing was first set for Sept. 23 but postponed to this week.</p>
