      <p>The Sudanese army described a Human Rights Watch report on the deadly crackdown by security forces against pro-democracy demonstrators last June as unprofessional and biased.<br/><br/>In a statement issued Friday, the army said the report by the New York-based group came at a time of political consensus and a transition in the country and hinted to the involvement of some figures from the transitional Sovereign Council in the crackdown.<br/><br/>The report contravenes the legal principle not to influence the independent committee tasked with probing the violence, it said.<br/><br/>Human Rights Watch said that the crackdown may have amounted to a crime against humanity.<br/><br/>It urged Sudan’s transitional government to carry out an “independent and transparent” investigation into the events.<br/><br/>The report said members of the RSF led by Mohamed Hamdan "Hemedti" Dagalo, who is now a member of the Sovereign Council, opened fire on unarmed civilians, leaving many of them instantly dead.<br/><br/>Nabil Adib, the head of the committee tasked with probing the crackdown, has denied that the HRW report would have any impact on his team’s work.<br/><br/>He stressed that the committee is keen on being transparent.<br/><br/>More than 100 people were killed and hundreds injured in the violent dispersal of the sit-in in Khartoum on June 3.</p>
