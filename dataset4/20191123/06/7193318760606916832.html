      <p>An Air Force instructor pilot and a young flight student were identified as the two airmen killed in an accident at Vance Air Force Base Thursday.</p>
      <p>Lt. Col. John “Matt” Kincade, 47, an instructor pilot assigned to the 5th Flying Training Squadron and 2nd Lt. Travis B. Wilkie, 23, a student pilot assigned to the 71st Student Squadron, were killed in the accident.</p>
      <p>Kincade, an Air Force reservist assigned to the 5th Flying Training Squadron, is survived by his wife and two sons. Social media posts indicate Kincade had previously served as a Navy pilot and is an Afghanistan war veteran.</p>
      <p>An Oklahoma State graduate, Kincade participated in a flyover at Oklahoma State's football game last Saturday against the University of Kansas.</p>
      <p>Wilkie, a native of San Diego, played baseball at the Air Force Academy, earning Academic All-Mountain West honors.</p>
      <p>"I came to the Academy to seek adventure, to challenge myself, and become the best person I can be," Wilkie said in an interview on the team's website. "The opportunity to obtain an amazing education and serve my country, while also playing Div. I baseball is unmatched.”</p>
      <p>Wilkie is survived by his wife, parents and sister.</p>
      <p>The two men were aboard a T-38 talon, performing a formation training mission when the incident occurred during landing. Images from the accident site showed Kincade and Wilkie's plane upside down, about 50 yards off the runway. A deep scar cut through the grass from the runway to where the jet finally stopped.</p>
      <p>The crew of a second T-38 talon involved in the accident was unharmed.</p>
      <p>Vance emergency response personnel responded to the scene to treat casualties and assist in recovery efforts.</p>
      <p>“We are a close-knit family,” Col. Corey Simmons said, 71st Flying Training Wing commander, “and when tragedies like this occur, every member of the U.S. military, Vance, Enid, feels it.”</p>
      <p>Simmons said the cause of the crash is still under investigation.</p>
      <p>The incident comes a little over a year after another T-38 from Vance crashed about 50 miles west of the base. The pilot in that crash, on Aug. 18, 2018, was able to safely eject from the aircraft. Before that, Simmons said the last major mishap at Vance was in 2000.</p>
      <p>"Our safety record is exemplary," Simmons said. "Our safety record in the Air Force in general, I would stand by it."</p>
      <p>Vance Air Force Base is home to the 71st Flying Training Wing, which trains Air Force and allied student pilots for deployment and Aerospace Expeditionary Force support. Vance has about 1,200 active duty and reserve service members, in addition to more than 1,100 family members living in the surrounding area.</p>
      <p>The T-38 Talon is a "twin-engine, high-altitude, supersonic jet trainer used in a variety of roles because of its design, economy of operations, ease of maintenance, high performance and exceptional safety record," according to an Air Force fact sheet. It is the primary trainer jet for airmen and has trained more than 72,000 U.S. Air Force pilots.</p>
      <p>According to manufacturer Northrop Gunman, nearly 1,200 Talons were produced from 1961 to 1972, and more than 500 remain operational with the Air Force and NASA. A replacement wing for the T-38 was designed to help extend the service life until 2020.</p>
