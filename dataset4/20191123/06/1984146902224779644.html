      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alice Irving</a></address>
      <p>Christmas is fast approaching and shoppers are on the lookout for deals.</p>
      <p>With plenty of offers online, many turn to one of the most popular websites in the world -  <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/">Amazon</a> .</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/11-amazon-online-shopping-hacks-17257333">Manchester Evening News</a> reports millions of shoppers head to the website to bag a bargain and take advantage of hard to beat delivery options.</p>
      <p>While there maybe plenty of deals to be had, the cost of your Christmas shop can soon mount up.</p>
      <p>But there are ways in which you can snap up amazing deals and save cash.</p>
      <p>These top tips will make sure you get the most out of your next Amazon shop.</p>
      <h3>1. Earn free Amazon vouchers</h3>
      <p>A website called  <a href="https://www.swagbucks.com/?clickId=0KdyyU0UNxyOWKYwUx0Mo3ERUkn1my0aBQjq3A0&amp;cmp=505&amp;cxid=19503-29857&amp;aff_sid=&amp;utm_source=IR&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=505&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=29857&amp;lp=2039">Swagbucks</a>  allows users to complete simple tasks like watching videos and answering polls to win 'SB' points.</p>
      <p>SB points can then be cashed in for Amazon vouchers.</p>
      <p>If you earn 700 SB in the first 30 days of your free membership Swagbucks will reward you with a £10 bonus.</p>
      <h3>2. Don't be had - become a price tracking expert</h3>
      <p><a href="https://uk.camelcamelcamel.com/">Camelcamelcamel</a>  is free Amazon price tracker.</p>
      <p>The site monitors millions of Amazon products and sends you an alert when the price drops.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create Amazon 'price watches' and receive the notifications via email and Twitter</li>
        <li>View a graph of a specific product's price history (data of over 18 million products has been collected)</li>
        <li>Add the  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-camelizer/ghnomdcacenbmilgjigehppbamfndblo">'Camelizer' extension</a>  to your browser to clearly view product data as you shop online so you can make sure that you're getting your chosen product for a good price</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The website also has a page dedicated to the biggest price drops in Amazon's history including price drops for LG televisions, iPhones and camera lenses.</p>
      <p>Click  <a href="https://uk.camelcamelcamel.com/signup">here</a>  to create a free account.</p>
      <h3>3. Spot potential refunds</h3>
      <p>An annoying aspect of online shopping is the possibility of late deliveries.</p>
      <p>But when your parcel arrives a day or two after it was expected - if Amazon is alerted - you could be compensated for the inconvience.</p>
      <p>Make sure you always email the company when you experience late deliveries or are unhappy with the service provided.</p>
      <p>You could also use <a href="https://paribus.co/">Paribus</a> .</p>
      <p>Paribus is a site that scans your confirmation emails and lets you know when you are owed a refund.</p>
      <p>The company also tracks return windows and like Camelcamelcamel, will also monitors product prices.</p>
      <h3>4. Visit the Amazon Outlet first</h3>
      <p>If you're after a particular product - have a look for it in the  <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Outlet/b/?ie=UTF8&amp;node=3012216031&amp;ref_=sv_uk_3&amp;nocache=1573743799853">Amazon Outlet</a>  section before you consider purchasing a full price product.</p>
      <p>The outlet features overstocked items in their original conditions.</p>
      <p>Deals have included 78 per cent off computer accessories and 58pc off baby products.</p>
      <h3>5. Check out Amazon Warehouse deals for a second-hand bargain</h3>
      <p>If you don't mind buying a used product - have a look at  <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Warehouse-Deals/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=3581866031">Amazon Warehouse</a> .</p>
      <p>Computing and electronic products are often advertised for at least £100 cheaper than their brand new equivalents.</p>
      <h3>6. Subscribe &amp; Save - and then cancel if you want to</h3>
      <p>Regular Amazon shoppers can save up to 15pc when receiving five or more subscriptions in a single delivery.</p>
      <p>Prime members can get up to 20pc off nappies and baby food when receiving five or more subscriptions in a single delivery.</p>
      <p>There's no commitment with the scheme so you can cancel after your first delivery.</p>
      <p>Amazon also has a  <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/b/ref=s9_acss_bw_cg_SNSABCG_md1_w?ie=UTF8&amp;node=5783213031&amp;ref=vp_v_sv_snss&amp;pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-6&amp;pf_rd_r=PTYQBK9V2TG4927QZAWF&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=7d2a7429-db27-4c3d-aec1-c06a525eea16&amp;pf_rd_i=12440861031">Subscribe &amp; Save Vouchers</a>  page where you can get up to 40pc off your first delivery when you set up a subscription for that product (some  <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/b/ref=amb_link_1?ie=UTF8&amp;node=5788003031&amp;pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-1&amp;pf_rd_r=XKA58R9WM9TBPDQ03DMX&amp;pf_rd_r=XKA58R9WM9TBPDQ03DMX&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=83f795a6-2dbc-49cf-bd41-773163e38224&amp;pf_rd_p=83f795a6-2dbc-49cf-bd41-773163e38224&amp;pf_rd_i=5783213031">restrictions</a>  apply).</p>
      <h3>7. Avoid shopping on your phone if you want a discount</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.joinhoney.com/trending/stores">Honey</a>  is a discount finding browser extension that doesn't work on mobile phone devices.</p>
