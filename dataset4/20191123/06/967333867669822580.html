        <b>MOSCOW (Sputnik) – The first session of the UN Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) concluded with a political declaration, Russia’s Permanent Representative to International Organizations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, said on Saturday.</b>

      <p>"UN Conference adopted Political Declaration in which it <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911191077351055-irans-un-ambassador-reveals-the-two-main-obstacles-to-a-nuclear-free-middle-east/">declared solemn commitment</a> to pursue in an open and inclusive manner the elaboration of a Treaty on WMD free zone in Middle East on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at by consensus by the States of the region," Ulyanov wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Ulyanov added that the conference <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201909241076882245-rouhani-merkel-discuss-iran-nuclear-deal-middle-east-tensions-in-new-york---tehran/">invited all Middle Eastern countries</a> to endorse the declaration and join the process.</p>
      <blockquote>"The Conference on WMD in Middle East decided that its annual sessions shall be held for a duration of 1 week starting on the third Monday of November of each year, unless otherwise decided. The second annual session of <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201902221072632021-danger-nuclear-arms-race/">UN Conference on WMD in Middle East will be held</a> on 16-20 November 2020. Until its opening Jordan will remain the President of the Conference and than in accordance with alphabetical order Kuwait will take over the relevant duties," Ulyanov also wrote.</blockquote>
      <p>A decision to convene the conference was made by the UN General Assembly in December 2018, when it mandated Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to organize the meeting.</p>
