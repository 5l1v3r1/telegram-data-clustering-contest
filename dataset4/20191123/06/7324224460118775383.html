      <h1>West Midlands Mayor gives full support to Feed a Family campaign</h1>
      <h2>West Midlands Mayor Andy Street is lending his support to the Express &amp; Star's Feed a Family This Christmas appeal.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:02:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/heather-large/" target="_blank">Heather Large</a></address>
      <p>He praised the generosity of our readers who for the fourth year running are rallying behind the festive campaign.</p>
      <p>Mr Street said: “The Express &amp; Star’s annual Feed a Family campaign has done so much to help so many during the festive period, and both the paper and its readers who give so generously to the campaign deserve enormous praise.</p>
      <p>“Christmas is a time of celebration, but we are all aware that for some it can be an incredibly challenging period.</p>
      <p>"I will be doing all I can to support the Feed a Family campaign, whilst also working with local authorities and charities across the region to make sure everybody in the West Midlands has access to food, accommodation, and all the support they need.</p>
      <p>“One of the real strengths of our region is the ability to rally together to support good causes, and I am sure we will see the best of that during this campaign.”</p>

      <p>We are aiming to provide families with Christmas treats they would otherwise not be able to afford, as well as supplying them with store cupboard essentials to keep them going through the festive season.</p>
      <p>The causes we are supporting this year are the Black Country Food Bank, which has centres across Dudley, Sandwell and Walsall, The Well (Home of Wolverhampton Food Bank), the Good Shepherd Ministry, based in Wolverhampton, and Cannock and District Food Bank.</p>
      <p>We are also collecting chocolate selection boxes for the Haven refuge in Wolverhampton which provides both practical and emotional support services to women and children who are affected by domestic violence and homelessness.</p>
      <p>These can be dropped off at our offices in Queen Street and will be given to youngsters to help spread some much-needed Christmas cheer.</p>
      <p>All of these good causes are helping individuals and families in need every day and have seen numbers needing support continue to rise.</p>
      <p>The appeal will run until Saturday, December 14 and donations can be taken to:</p>
