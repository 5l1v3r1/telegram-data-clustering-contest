      <p>The final episode of Friday Night SmackDown before WWE Survivor Series was full of chaos owing to the repeated rundowns from the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">NXT</a> and RAW roster.</p>
      <p>In the first match of the night, Rhea Ripley managed to gain a victory over RAW's Charlotte Flair and SmackDown's Sasha Banks in a triple threat battle. This was followed by the debut match of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/undisputed-era">The Undisputed Era</a> on the Blue brand as they collided against The New Day and Heavy Machinery. Once again, the representatives of the Black &amp; Gold brand stood tall on SmackDown with Roderick Strong pinning Otis. NXT Women's Champion Shayna Baszler also showed up on the show and engaged in a brawl with the SmackDown Women's Champion Bayley.</p>
      <p>The show concluded with <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/triple-h">Triple H</a>, Shawn Michaels and Road Dogg leading the NXT roster to takeover SmackDown en route to Survivor Series.</p>
      <h3>DX reunites</h3>
      <p>Triple H and company recreated the DX invasion from the days of Attitude Era on tonight's SmackDown. Like the original instance, they were successful tonight as well. The WWE COO took to Twitter to reflect on the same after SmackDown went off-air.</p>

      <p>NXT Senior Producer and WWE Hall of Famer, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/shawn-michaels">Shawn Michaels</a>, also mocked the Blue brand for not being able to stop the dominance of the Black &amp; Gold brand on the latest show.</p>

      <p>How will SmackDown respond to this? We will get the answer this Sunday, at WWE Survivor Series.</p>
