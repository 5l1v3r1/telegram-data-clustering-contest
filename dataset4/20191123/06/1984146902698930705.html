      <p>Newcastle United's big French defender Ludwig Francillette has spoken of his delight at grabbing his first goal in Toon colours - and hopes it can be the first of many.</p>
      <p>The 6ft 4in centre-back has impressed in the club's Under-23 side since making a summer move to St James' Park and is starting to look the part for the Magpies.</p>
      <p>Francillette's bullet header after 13 minutes against Benfica helped Newcastle earn a draw in their first Premier League International Cup clash of the season at Whitley Park.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Chronicle Live, Francillette said: "It was brilliant for me to get my first goal for Newcastle.</p>
      <p>"It was incredible for me to see it hit the back of the net.</p>
      <p>"I just got a touch on it and looked and the ball had flew into the top corner, so it was great for me.</p>
      <p>"I have been working on in training so it was great to see it come off."</p>
      <p>The imposing centre-back has looked a real threat in opposition boxes in the last few weeks, when asked if playing as a defender is his only position, the defender said: "Yes I scored a few in France, I'm not sure how many, but not too many like this.</p>
      <p>"When I was a kid I played as a striker so I scored a few then!</p>
      <p>"The main thing is it was a good performance for the team.</p>
      <p>"We're a little bit sad about the draw but we need to keep going.</p>
      <p>"We must now see this out in the last two group games."</p>

      <p>Francillette's performance came in front of newly appointed first team coach Steve Harper, who will now push reports into the path of head coach Steve Bruce.</p>
      <p>The youngster said: "I didn't know if he was watching.</p>
      <p>"But I hope he enjoyed the game.</p>
      <p>"It is a really positive sign (that he was watching on)</p>
      <p>"One day we all dream of playing for the first team, that is the dream for us all."</p>
      <p>The goal was further evidence that Francillette is not only finding his feet on Tyneside but also putting himself in contention for first team action.</p>
      <p>He said: "I feel at home now.</p>
      <p>"My team-mates are helping me and I have made a lot of friends.</p>
      <p>"It is all good.</p>
      <p>"I don't do English lessons but I am picking it up."</p>
