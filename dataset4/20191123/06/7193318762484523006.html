      <p>Tobias Harris scored 26 points, Joel Embiid had 21 points and 14 rebounds, and the Philadelphia 76ers beat San Antonio 115-104 on Friday night to hand the Spurs their eighth straight defeat.</p>
      <p>The skid is the Spurs’ longest under longtime coach Gregg Popovich. Ben Simmons had a triple-double with 10 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds for the 76ers, who improved to 6-0 at home.</p>
      <p>San Antonio last dropped eight in a row in November 1996 under coach Bob Hill. Popovich was the team’s general manager at the time. He fired Hill later that season and began his long run of success.</p>
      <p>In his 24th season, Popovich has won five NBA titles and gone to the playoffs in 22 straight seasons while compiling a winning record in each of those 22 campaigns. He has spent just 74 days with a losing record over the last 22 seasons.</p>
      <p><b>MAVERICKS 143, CAVALIERS 101:</b> Luka Doncic had 30 points and 14 assists with former teammate Dirk Nowitzki watching as a retiree for the first time.</p>
      <p>It was Nowitzki’s first live look at Dallas’ new European pairing of Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis, the 7-foot-3 Latvian who missed his five shots but made his last six, finishing with 17 points and four blocks. Rookie Darius Garland scored a career-high 23 points for the Cavaliers, who lost their sixth straight game.</p>
      <p><b>PISTONS 128, HAWKS 103:</b> Andre Drummond had 23 points and 15 rebounds, helping Detroit to a 128-103 win over the Atlanta Hawks that included the Pistons' highest-scoring first half since 1983.</p>
      <p>Detroit led 76-57 at halftime, and the Pistons reached 100 points with over five minutes remaining in the third quarter. Nine different Detroit players made at least one 3-pointer. Drummond wasn't one of them, but he scored his share of easy baskets inside as the Pistons snapped their five-game losing streak. Atlanta has dropped five straight.</p>
      <p><b>WIZARDS 125, HORNETS 118:</b> Bradley Beal had 30 points and 12 assists, Thomas Bryant added 21 points and 11 rebounds, and the Washington Wizards overcame a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Davis Bertans added 20 points off the bench, hitting six 3-pointers to help the Wizards win two in a row for the first time this season.</p>
      <p><b>HEAT 116, BULLS 108:</b> Jimmy Butler had 27 points against his former team and the Miami Heat beat the Chicago Bulls 116-108 for their fifth straight victory.</p>
      <p>Butler was 7 of 10 from the field and had seven assists and five rebounds. Bam Adebayo added 16 points and 14 rebounds, and Kendrick Nunn scored 13 of his 21 points in the first quarter to help Miami improve to 11-3.</p>
      <p><b>NETS 116, KINGS 97:</b> Spencer Dinwiddie scored 23 points and Joe Harris added 22 as Brooklyn never trailed. Harrison Barnes led the Kings with 18 points.</p>
