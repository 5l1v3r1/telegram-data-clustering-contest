      <p>After a close defeat to the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/nelson-mandela-bay-stars">Nelson Mandela Bay Giants</a>, Cape Town Blitz faces <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/paarl-rocks">Paarl Rocks</a> in the first MSL 2019 game on Sunday. Both teams have already faced each other in the tournament. Paarl Rocks annihilated the Cape Town Blitz batting unit with their accuracy with the ball to earn a 86 run win.</p>
      <p>Since then, Paarl Rocks and Cape Town Blitz have managed to win a game or two to stay in contention for a knockout spot. Cape Town Blitz looks the more balanced side on paper with Quinton de Kock leading his troops well. However, he comes across a decent Paarl Rocks side with the likes of Faf du Plessis and Henry Davids at the helm.</p>
      <p>While another close contest is on offer, both teams would be eyeing a win to strengthen their case for a top three finish. Here are a few tips to help you pick your Dream11 team for CTB vs PR.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Squads to choose from:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Cape Town Blitz:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Quinton de Kock (C), Wahab Riaz, Liam Livingstone, Moeen Ali, Janneman Malan, Dale Steyn, Sisanda Magala, Anrich Nortje, Asif Ali, Mohammad Nawaz, George Linde, David Bedingham, Vernon Philander, Marques Ackerman, Gregory Mahlokwana, Aviwe Mgijima, Khwezi Gumede.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Paarl Rocks:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Faf du Plessis (C), Henry Davids, James Vince, JP Duminy, Dwaine Pretorius, Isuru Udana, Cameron Delport, Kerwin Mungroo, Ferisco Adams, Kyle Verreynne, Mangaliso Mosehle, Tabraiz Shamsi, Hardus Viljoen, Bjorn Fortuin, Sibonelo Makhanya, and Thando Ntini.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Playing XI Updates:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Cape Town Blitz:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Although they did suffer a loss in their previous game, Cape Town Blitz should persist with the same set of players for this game. Quinton de Kock and Janneman Malan open the batting with the likes of Liam Livingstone and Marques Ackerman also getting some runs under their belts.</p>
      <p>Asif Ali and George Linde provide the impetus towards the end with the veteran, Wahab Riaz also capable of wielding the long handle. Ambidextrous spinner, Gregory Mahlokwana handles the spin duties while Dale Steyn and Anrich Nortje remain the key in the bowling unit.</p>
      <p>Possible XI: de Kock(C&amp;WK), Malan, Ackerman, Livingstone, Asif Ali, Linde, Wahab, Mahlokwana, Steyn, Magala and Nortje</p>
      <p>
        <b>Paarl Rocks:</b>
      </p>
      <p>As for Paarl Rocks, a win over Jozi Stars on Friday should ensure no changes in the playing XI. Although Paarl Rocks have been able to churn out two wins, none of their batsmen, barring James Vince, has been able to convert their starts into big ones.</p>
      <p>The form of Faf du Plessis is a major concern with the South African Test captain due for a big score. Their bowling unit, however, has been right on the money. With as many as six quality options available, Paarl Rocks have relied on variety and precision to restrict oppositions. Bjorn Fortuin and Tabriaz Shamsi are two of the best spinners in the league with their battle against Quinton de Kock being crucial to the outcome of this game.</p>
      <p>Possible XI: Delport, Davids, Vince, du Plessis (C), Pretorius, Mosehle (WK), Udana, Fortuin, Shamsi, Viljoen and Mungroo.</p>

        <b>Match Details:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cape Town Blitz vs Paarl Rocks, Match 15</p>
      <p>24th November 2019, 1:30 PM IST</p>
      <p>Newlands, Capetown</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Pitch Report:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The only match played in Newlands this season saw a decent pitch being provided. Although there is extra pace and bounce for the pacers, teams will eye a score of about 180. Batting second would be the ideal option with the weather being perfect for a good game of cricket.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Fantasy Tips and Suggestions:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Wicket-keeper:</b> Quinton de Kock is yet to score a fifty this season after five outings for the Cape Town Blitz. However, de Kock's 146 runs this season have come at a strike-rate of 175. With the kind of touch he is in at the moment, one wouldn't bet against de Kock coming good on Saturday.</p>
      <p><b>Batsmen:</b> Like his counterpart de Kock, Faf du Plessis is yet to come up with a substantial score in MSL 2019. The Paarl Rocks captain is due for a big score and should definitely get going on what is a good pitch to bat on.</p>
      <p>Along with him, one of Henry Davids or Cameron Delport should also fit the bill. Another worthwhile option is Janneman Malan, who has scored 165 runs so far. While his form holds him in good stead, Asif Ali could also be opted for his big hitting ability.</p>
      <p><b>Allrounders:</b> Dwaine Pretorius put in a man of the match performance in the previous game for Paarl Rocks. While he has been consistently chipping in with cameos in the batting unit, his variations should do the trick against Cape Town Blitz as well.</p>
      <p>Isuru Udana and George Linde have also shown glimpses of their ability which make them viable candidates for the fantasy team as well while Liam Livingstone is definitely one to watch out for in this game.</p>
      <p><b>Bowlers:</b> Anrich Nortje has been brilliant this year in spite of him being a touch expensive. With wickets being the key metric here, Anrich Nortje should be picked along with one of Wahab Riaz and Dale Steyn.</p>
      <p>While Bjorn Fortuin's economical left-arm spin is a valuable asset as well, Tabriaz Shamsi should get the nod over Hardus Viljoen. Nevertheless, considering the fact that Hardus Viljoen won the man of the match award in his previous outing against the Blitz, he could be picked as well.</p>
      <p><b>Captain:</b> Quinton de Kock and Faf du Plessis are the front-runners for captaincy with both of them capable of scoring big runs. With both of them yet to score a fifty, one can expect one or both of them to break the pattern. Along with them, Dwaine Pretorius is a reasonable option as well with his bowling ability also being utilized by Paarl Rocks.</p>
      <p><b>Fantasy Suggestion #1:</b> Quinton de Kock, Janneman Malan, Faf du Plessis, Cameron Delport, Liam Livingstone, George Linde, Dwaine Pretorius, Anrich Nortje, Wahab Riaz, Hardus Viljoen and Bjorn Fortuin. Captain: Faf du Plessis, Vice-Captain: Quinton de Kock</p>
      <p><b>Fantasy Suggestion #2:</b> Quinton de Kock, Henry Davids, Asif Ali, Faf du Plessis, Isuru Udana, Dwaine Pretorius, Liam Livingstone, Tabriaz Shamsi, Bjorn Fortuin, Anrich Nortje and Wahab Riaz. Captain: Quinton de Kock, Vice-Captain: Dwaine Pretorius</p>
