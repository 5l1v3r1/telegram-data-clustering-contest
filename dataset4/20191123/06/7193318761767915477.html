      <p>Unafraid of the spotlight, the golden retriever greeted the room with an excited "Hello."</p>
      <p>As Bob Funk Sr. addressed a roomful of first responders, both human and K-9, from law enforcement and firefighting companies around the state, he turned to look at and introduce the newest member of Oklahoma’s lifesaving team.</p>
      <p>“We are happy to support the first responders,” Funk said. "With an amazing dog called Indy.”</p>
      <p>On cue, Indy let out a loud, ringing bark to let everyone know he was ready for the job.</p>
      <p>As part of the Passing of the Leash ceremony on Friday at the Oklahoma City National Memorial &amp; Museum, every person who played a part in Indy becoming the newest member of the search and rescue team for Oklahoma Task Force 1, also got to say goodbye as the golden retriever goes to his new home.</p>
      <p>Taking turns handing Indy’s leash down the line, Indy’s original owner, his trainers, his support team and several big fans presented the dog to his new owner, Firefighter Tyler Barry of the Moore Fire Department.</p>
      <p>“It’s awesome,” Barry said after receiving Indy’s leash. “When it comes down to it, he’s basically just a direction extension of myself. It’s awesome to have that counterpart and it’s really going to add value to our community.”</p>
      <p>Barry, 30, had experience with working dogs before. He served for six years in the Air Force, deploying to Afghanistan for nearly three years and working on a team with a bomb-sniffing K-9.</p>
      <p>When he returned home and joined the Moore Fire Department three years ago, he said he was encouraged to bring his passion for working dogs with him.</p>
      <p>“They encouraged me to keep pushing toward it,” Barry said. “We are just constantly trying to improve our level of care that we can provide to our community and Indy will play a big role in that.”</p>
      <p>In addition to becoming the sixth member of Oklahoma Task Force 1, Indy will also play a vital role in the community by going to schools and doing outreach for the Moore Fire Department.</p>
      <p>Indy was trained at Ground Zero Emergency Training Center in Tuttle, founded by former University of Oklahoma football coach Barry Switzer and his wife, Becky.</p>
      <p>Head trainer Todd Frazier said dogs that come through Ground Zero are taught how search a disaster area, combing through rubble and debris while using their scent-tracking skills to locate possible survivors in a disaster.</p>
      <p>A dog can cut down recovery time on a disaster site from weeks to just a few hours.</p>
      <p>Frazier said the best candidates to become search-and-rescue dogs must demonstrate great nerve and remain emotionally stable in difficult environments.</p>
      <p>Indy was a natural.</p>
      <p>“He has just excelled,” Frazier said. “He’s the quickest dog we’ve put through the program.</p>
      <p>“We haven’t had a dog take to this quite like Indy.”</p>
      <p>The average cost of a search-and-rescue dog from Ground Zero is about $50,000. But Indy was provided as a gift to the Moore Fire Department courtesy of Express Employment International’s Philanthropic Committee.</p>
      <p>“It’s an emotional thing to be able to get another dog,” Barry said. “Today makes us better. We are one step closer to providing a better level of protection to our community.”</p>
