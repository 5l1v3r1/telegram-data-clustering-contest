      <h1>Maharashtra surprise: Inside details of Phir Ek Baar Devendra Fadnavis moment</h1>
      <h2>A early morning swearing-in. A stunned nation. Flying recriminations. Cries of betrayal. In Maharashtra, it is politics at its most feverish pitch. Here's how it unfolded, from the hours before the oath-taking ceremony to the chorus of astonishment afterwards.</h2>

      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Fadnavis's appointment as Maha CM stuns nation, opposition</li>
        <li>NCP leaders say clueless about Ajit Pawar jumping ship</li>
        <li>Party and family split, says Supriya Sule</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Abhishek Manu Singhvi thought it was fake news. Ahmed Patel fulminated against an "evil" manouevre carried out "in the secrecy of midnight". Sanjay Raut spoke of betrayal and backstabbing.</p>
      <p>Until this morning, Congress, Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders probably felt they had it in the bag: An unlikely governing alliance and a chance to share power in one of India's largest states. It would require compromises, sure, but it would keep the BJP out of government.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/devendra-fadnavis-maharashtra-cm-again-1621847-2019-11-23">And then it happened</a>. A made-for-TV scene that must have slackened jaw after jaw in Maharashtra and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>It wasn't just that a swearing-in ceremony was taking place in Raj Bhavan when few Indians had been awake long enough to worry about breakfast.</p>
      <p>And it wasn't just that the man promising to bear true faith and allegiance to the Consitution was Devendra Fadnavis, a BJP man.</p>
      <p>The unkindest cut of all, for the BJP's rivals, came from one of their own. For the man who took oath as Fadnavis's deputy was NCP leader Ajit Pawar, the nephew of Sharad Pawar.</p>
      <p>It's been an extraordinary morning -- one during which the practised melodrama of political utterances matched the pace and emotion of real events -- and now, India Today TV has learned how it went for Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar, before they were swore in.</p>
      <p>
        <b>PODIUM, MIKES WERE READY</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was 7:30 am when Devendra Fadnavis left the official home of the Maharashtra chief minister, Varsha. His family was with him, but not Ajit Pawar. The NCP leader reached Raj Bhavan separately, also accompanied by family.</p>
      <p>The duo met the governor, Bhagat Singh Koshyari, and claimed the right to form a government.</p>
      <p>A podium with microphones was already ready.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Sources think Ajit Pawar used letters of support signed by NCP MLAs -- letters that didn't say whom to support -- to offer support to Fadnavis.</p>
      <blockquote>"Never felt so cheated in my life. Defended him, loved him."<cite>- NCP leader Supriya Sule's WhatsApp status</cite></blockquote>
      <p>As well, at least two Opposition leaders have said Pawar misused the letters.</p>
      <p>
        <b>BODY LANGUAGE</b>
      </p>
      <p>At a press conference held after the swearing-in, an angry Shiv Sena leader described behaviour by Ajit Pawar that he seemed to think was suspicious.</p>
      <p>Sanjay Raut said that on Friday night, Pawar left suddenly, "didn't look into our eyes" and was "trying not to face us".</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Sharad Pawar, Ajit's uncle, said the NCP had nothing to do with this morning's developments.</p>
      <p>"Ajit Pawar's decision to support the BJP to form the Maharashtra government is his personal decision and not that of the Nationalist Congress Party," he tweeted.<br/><br/>"We place on record that we do not support or endorse this decision of his."</p>
      <p>WhatsApp statues posted by Supriya Sule, Sharad Pawar's daughter, spoke volumes.</p>
      <p>"Party and family split."</p>
      <p>Then: "Never felt so cheated in my life. Defended him, loved him."<br/><br/>"Look what I get in return."</p>
