      <p>I first made this dish, aged 14, for my Junior Cert home economics practical exam. I’ll never forget it because I made it so many times in the lead-up. My entire family had to endure countless variations, with chilli flakes, basil, or too much black pepper. My final version was fairly basic and I was delighted to serve it up with a sprig of curly parsley, picked from my parents’ garden that morning.</p>

      <p>I had excellent home economics teachers. Ms McSweeney brought in star fruit for us for one exam, and we all garnished our breakfast dishes with it. She really brought the subject to life with her creativity. Mrs Hurley had seen everything in her years teaching, so no question was too basic for her as she saw us all making the same rookie mistakes, setting tea towels alight and letting pans of milk boil over. Her reactions were always calm and measured so as not to discourage us.</p>
      <p>I try to be the same now with my children. My eldest is seven, and I love seeing him learning the ropes in the kitchen. He loves combining flavours and creating recipes of his own. I hope he will go on to study home economics in secondary school. Cooking is a skill for life, and often school is the only place where children are allowed free rein in the kitchen.</p>
      <p>This stew is extremely versatile. If you can’t find fresh fennel bulbs, then use celery or leeks. I sometimes add a handful of finely chopped curly kale or spinach to the stew just before adding the fish. The potatoes add heartiness and soak up all of the delicious sauce. I’ve used sweet potatoes before too, just watch they don’t overcook.</p>
      <p>Instead of potatoes you could tumble in some pasta shells, in keeping with the nautical theme. A few mussels or prawns can be added too for a more indulgent version. I often make the base of this stew the night before we want to eat it and reheat it before adding the fish as a finishing touch. It freezes really well, too. </p>
