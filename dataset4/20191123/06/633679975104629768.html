      <p>The government says it fully recognises rating agency, S&amp;P Global’s assessment of the problems and opportunities facing South Africa, and remains committed to placing public finances on a sustainable path while aiming for inclusive economic growth.</p>
      <p>National Treasury said on Saturday it had noted S&amp;P Global’s decision to affirm South Africa’s long-term foreign currency debt rating at "BB" and local currency debt rating at "BB+", as well as revise the outlook to negative from stable.</p>
      <p>"South Africa’s foreign and local credit ratings by S&amp;P Global remain below investment grade. According to S&amp;P, the outlook revision indicates that the country's debt metrics are rapidly worsening as a result of the very low GDP growth and high fiscal deficits," the National Treasury said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The agency stated that unless government took measures to control the fiscal deficit and fast-track the implementation of reforms, debt was unlikely to stabilise within S&amp;P Global’s three-year forecast period.</p>
