      <p><b>WASHINGTON: </b>US forces have lost an unarmed drone aircraft over Libya, where well-armed militants are battling for power with a UN-recognised government, the Pentagon announced on Friday.</p>
      <p>“An unarmed US Africa Command remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) was lost over Tripoli, Libya” on Thursday, the command said in a statement.</p>

      <p>No reason was given for the loss, and the Africa Command said it was under investigation.</p>
      <p>The command conducts drone operations in Libya “to assess the ongoing security situation and monitor violent militant activity,” it said.</p>
      <p>“These operations are critical to counter terror activity in Libya and are fully coordinated with appropriate government officials.”</p>
      <p>The US drone loss came a day after forces loyal to Libya’s strongman Khalifa Haftar said they shot down an Italian drone in western Libya, flying in a zone under their control.</p>

      <p>US activities in the country have both monitored the conflict between the government and Haftar’s forces, and the growing power of an Islamic State-allied militant cell in the country’s southwest.</p>
      <p>In September the US Africa Command conducted several air strikes against the Libyan IS force, and claimed it had killed dozens.</p>
