        <b><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/bharti-airtel-ltd/stocks/companyid-2718.cms">Bharti Airtel</a> has been consolidating for a huge number of years and if the stock comes true to its potential, then there could be a much bigger breakout in Bharti Airtel, says <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Kunal-Bothra">Kunal Bothra</a>, kunalbothra.co.in. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b><b>ET Now: </b>Bank <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/indices/nifty_50_companies">Nifty</a> is up for the seventh week in a row. What do you make of it?<br/></b><b>Kunal Bothra: </b>Seventh week in a row for Bank Nifty and it has now come back to those six- month highs. I think 31,660 was the six-month high for Bank Nifty and we have tried to conquer that level for the index and the very good part about the rise in Bank Nifty is the consistent build up of open interest in the last two to three weeks.</p>
      <p>When you see a rise of an open interest and the prices moving up higher, you generally tend to expect or anticipate that there have been long players who enter at every rise and that has been one of the key reasons why Bank Nifty has been consistently finding support even after intraday corrections. But the catch is that the Nifty on the weekly chart is now forming a triple doji pattern.</p>
      <p>For the last three weeks, Nifty has remained in an absolutely tight range. The support was at 11,800-11,820 and 12,030 or 12,040 was the previous resistance. We have remained in this 200 odd point band for the last three weeks and all of the three weeks have resulted into flat closing. That is certainly a pattern which indicates that there is a big trend in the making over the next one or two weeks max.</p>
      <p>As an index trader, you have to wait for either of these levels to be breached. If 11,800 gives way, then look out for more shorting ideas and if 12,040 gets breached on the upper end, the index could go into a very strong uptrend. <br/><b><br/>ET Now: Coming to Zee, it seems the selling is over. The promoters hardly have any stake to sell. What do you make of Zee’s move this week?</b> <br/><b>Kunal Bothra: </b>This could be a turnaround move for Zee even if it is a short-term rally. Many of these stocks which are coming out their slumber are showing signs of promise. It all depends on how the fundamentals catch up.</p>
      <p>For example, for many of these stocks, the way many of the short traders who were trapped in Zee stock, managed to enclose their positions and then we saw a consistent buildup. After that initial gap-up the stock had seen on Thursday, it settled off lower, but on Friday, we saw buying again and the stock closed at the highest point of the week.</p>
      <p>That itself indicates that there was a blend of both the short covering as well as long build up which happened for Zee and that means this should be a trend reversal for the stock, maybe a Rs 400-420 could be possible, but the timeframe has to be extended not just in one week but over the next two to three weeks, you could see the stock coming back to those levels.</p>
      <p><b>ET Now: What do you make of the telecom names, what does price action tell you?</b> <br/><b>Kunal Bothra: </b>You have to concentrate only on two largecap names -- Bharti and Reliance. Reliance has moved up way ahead in terms of price patterns. It has now come into a zone which is indicative of a slight overbought nature of indicator. I may go ahead and give it a buy, but if the stock gives you any sort of correction, then that could be an opportunity to buy.</p>
      <p>Bharti Airtel could be a turnaround stock, like Reliance was in 2017 where after 10 years of consolidation, there was a breakout. Bharti Airtel is trying to show those kind of patterns on the longer term charts. It has been consolidating for a huge number of years and if the stock comes true to its potential, then you could see a much bigger breakout in Bharti Airtel. The beta or the higher returns could be gained more in Bharti Airtel rather than Reliance at current levels. <br/><b><br/>ET Now: What do you make of RBL or select names that were continuously falling earlier when the private banks were going down?</b> <br/><b>Kunal Bothra: </b>The charts of RBL Bank, Zee, Indiabulls Housing and many of these other stocks over two weeks and especially last week, have reflected a flurry in price action. That generally indicates that the last leg of short covering is happening into these stocks. When we see a price action of 10%, 15% in these stocks within a very short period of time on an intraday or one or two days basis, then that can be considered more of a short covering rally. We need to see whether this short covering rally engulfs into more long which has been built up into the stock.</p>
      <p>If that happens, if those signs get visible over the next one or two weeks, then you can expect this to be a short-term rally but this could be a trend in the making. As of now, it is a short covering which is happening and this trend could continue for the next one week.</p>
      <p><b>ET Now: In terms of PSUs, anything interesting? SBI at Rs 330, some of the smaller ones, which are not a part of F&amp;O led rally?</b> <br/><b>Kunal Bothra: </b>The PSU banking pack looks very attractive to me. SBI is one of the leaders in terms of price performance. It has been charging up pretty well in the last one month, one-and-a-half odd month from Rs 250 to Rs 330 odd level.</p>
      <p>I believe the other candidates are also trying to get ready in terms of the price breakouts. The PSU bank index overall is forming an inverse head and shoulder pattern and it is more of a classic pattern if you look at the charts over the last two months.</p>
      <p>But then we tried to find which stocks are leaders which have given a breakout earlier than the sector. Canara Bank stands out to be one of the stocks which has given a breakout earlier than the PSU bank sector and that could be another leader in terms of the price performer.</p>
      <p>Bank of India, Union Bank has also shown a lot of potential in the last one to two weeks. These stocks could be the third and the fourth rung candidates in that space and probably led by other stocks like Syndicate Bank and Bank of India, which are laggards in terms of price performance.</p>
      <p><b>ET Now: Any picks for our viewers?</b> <br/><b>Kunal Bothra: </b>I think it is time to be more stock specific because of the extremely range bound activity in the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/markets">markets</a>. I am mixing the trades with one buy and one sell. The first one is a buy on Trident, it is a midcap. In last two days of the previous week it has shown some very good price recovery from Rs 58-59 levels to Rs 62.5-63 plus. I believe the stock could be bought into on a positional basis and targets could be kept at Rs 69 and stop loss at the support of 60 odd.</p>
      <p>The second is a sell on Berger Paints. Many of these stocks which had rallied extremely well in September and October are now showing signs of fatigue and correction. Berger Paints is one of them. Stock retracing back towards its mean, This process could continue for a couple of days more and it is a sell with a short-term targets on Berger Paints of Rs 450 and stop loss at Rs 492.</p>
