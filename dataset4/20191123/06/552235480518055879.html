      <h1>Gap between SPFL, juniors and non-league is closing as Scottish Cup shocks prove</h1>
      <h2>Ten sides from outwith the pro ranks are gearing up for this weekend's Scottish Cup 3rd round.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Robbie Horn listened patiently while the BBC Radio 5 Live presenter wrapped up an interview with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> - before announcing it was over to Bonnyrigg to speak to the man himself.</p>
      <p>Talk about an epiphany.</p>
      <p>It was January 2017 and the Bonnyrigg Rose gaffer was preparing for the biggest game in the club’s 136-year history against Hibs in the fourth round of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/william-hill-scottish-cup">Scottish Cup</a>.</p>
      <p>Horn, who made one appearance for his beloved Hearts 20 years ago, went on to enjoy a lower league career with Forfar and Berwick before moving into the juniors.</p>
      <p>But this was a whole new ball game as it finally hit home just what the Scottish Cup can mean to clubs like his.</p>
      <p>Now in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lowland-league">Lowland League</a> after making the historic decision to break from the juniors along with 25 other east region clubs in 2018, Bonnyrigg are one of 10 sides from across the juniors, Lowland, Highland and East of Scotland Leagues who will take their place in this weekend’s third round.</p>
      <p>Three of them do so having already scalped an SPFL club in this season’s competition. And there’s a growing feeling they won’t be the last.</p>
      <p>Simultaneously on Saturday, October 26, Stenhousemuir and Cowdenbeath were comprehensively being dumped out by clubs in the sixth tier of Scottish football, Penicuik and Broxburn to be precise.</p>
      <p>A week earlier junior side <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/auchinleck-talbot">Auchinleck Talbot</a> had sent Paul Hartley’s ambitious Cove Rangers spinning out the competition for the second year in a row.</p>
      <p>In total there’s been 17 occasions in the last four years where an SPFL side has been humbled by a club from outwith the professional set-up.</p>
      <p>Auchinleck’s giantslaying of Championship challengers Ayr United live on TV last season was the biggest of them all.</p>
      <p>But only two years earlier Horn’s Bonnyrigg too had taken a Championship scalp of their own - Dumbarton - to set up their historic clash with Hibs at Tynecastle.</p>

      <p>And as he prepares to lead his side into Saturday’s third round tie with Montrose, Horn reckons the gap between the lower reaches of the SPFL and the non-league has never been so slim.</p>
      <p>“Financially it’s massive for the clubs if they can get a run in the cup,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I remember we beat Dumbarton over two games a couple of seasons ago. We drew at Bonnyrigg and I thought we were the better team.</p>
      <p>“Everyone thought that was our chance but I fancied us at their place in the replay.</p>
      <p>“The pressure was on them and they weren’t doing so well in the league. Adam Nelson scored a wonder goal to win it for us and that will be remembered in Bonnyrigg for a long, long time as will the celebrations!</p>
      <p>“The replay was put back a week so we got to watch the fourth round draw before knowing if we would be in it and when it came through that we got Hibs it gave us a huge incentive.</p>

      <p>“The build-up to that one became a bit of a circus to be honest.</p>
      <p>“I remember being live on the radio on the day of the game and they were speaking to Jurgen Klopp and then all of a sudden it was ‘Now we go over to Robbie Horn’.</p>
      <p>“It was utterly bizarre. That moment took me aback and brought home just what we had achieved.”</p>
      <p>Horn admits his side got caught up in the occasion as they were blitzed 8-1 by Hibs. But it’s the Montrose’s of the Scottish football world that are the realistic target rather than the Hibees.</p>
      <p>Which brings us to why there are more and more scalps being dealt out by non-league clubs.</p>
      <p>Stenhousemuir (twice) Cowdenbeath (three times), Forfar (twice), Cove Rangers, Ayr United, Dumbarton, Stirling Albion, Airdrie, Stranraer, East Fife, Annan, Clyde, Montrose … all suffering what would once have been seen as a humiliation in the last four years.</p>
      <p>No wonder Queen’s Park have given up their amateur status for fear of the growing beast from the Lowland and Highland Leagues.</p>
      <p>Horn said: “I think there’s a lot more money available now to clubs outside of League 1 and 2 and tams are competing for the same players now. The top three or four teams in the Lowland League are paying sometimes the same wages as the clubs in League 1 and 2.</p>

      <p>“That means players who are local to that area might be attracted knowing they don’t have to travel as far and might like the ambition of these clubs.</p>
      <p>“You get a lot of players dropping down now who know what the professional game is all about.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got Johnny Brown, Johnny Stewart, Dean Brett, Ewan Moyes, Kerr Young, Kieran McGachie, Lee Currie, George Hunter all of whom have been senior at different times and they have dropped a level for different reasons.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes it’s work related and it can be easier to get a night off training for work whereas the higher you go up the leagues then you have to make training and there certainly can’t be any holidays.</p>
      <p>“But there isn’t the gap that once existed and it certainly makes things a little more interesting in the Scottish Cup.”</p>
