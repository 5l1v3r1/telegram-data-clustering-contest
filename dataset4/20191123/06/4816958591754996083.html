      <p>Isaiah Stewart scored a game-high 18 points despite limited minutes, and No. 25 Washington pulled away late to defeat visiting Montana 73-56 Friday night in a foul-filled nonconference game in Seattle.</p>
      <p>Jaden McDaniels added 14 points and six rebounds while Nahziah Carter scored 13 points with seven boards for the Huskies (4-1).</p>
      <p>Stewart, a freshman forward who was one of the top recruits in the nation, played just 15 minutes because of foul trouble. He picked up three fouls in the first half, then got his fourth while trying to grab a defensive rebound with 18:45 remaining.</p>
      <p>Senior guards Kendal Manuel and Sayeed Pridgett led Montana (1-4) with 15 and 13 points, respectively. Pridgett fouled out with 8:21 remaining.</p>
      <p>There were 51 fouls called, with 33 against the Grizzlies. Montana, which dressed just nine players, had two players foul out.</p>
      <p>Pridgett’s 3-pointer with 18:01 remaining gave the Grizzlies a 32-31 advantage, their only lead of the game.</p>
      <p>Quade Green responded with back-to-back baskets, a layup and a jump shot, as Washington regained the lead for good.</p>
      <p>Manuel’s 3-pointer cut the Grizzlies’ deficit to 44-41 with 12:28 left, but the Huskies went on a 19-5 run to pull away.</p>
      <p>The Huskies took a 31-29 halftime lead, thanks to Jamal Bey’s driving layup that barely beat the buzzer.</p>
      <p>Washington, which had gotten off to slow starts in each of its previous four games, made four of its first six shots in taking a 9-0 lead. But the Grizzlies scored the next nine points to tie it before the Huskies put together an 8-0 run.</p>
      <p>Washington had a 38-10 advantage in points in the paint.</p>
      <p>The Grizzlies stayed in the game by making 9 of 22 3-point attempts, while the Huskies were 0-for-11 from beyond the arc. The teams combined for 41 turnovers, with the Washington committing 21.</p>
