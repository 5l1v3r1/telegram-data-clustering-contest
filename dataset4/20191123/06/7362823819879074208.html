      <h1>Peggy Noonan: On impeachment, Trump’s defenders have no defense</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:06:32+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:06</time> by <a rel="author">Peggy Noonan</a></address>
      <p>Look, the case has been made. Almost everything in the impeachment hearings this week fleshed out and backed up the charge that President Trump muscled <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine">Ukraine</a> for political gain. The pending question is what precisely the House and its Democratic majority will decide to include in the articles of impeachment, what statutes or standards they will assert the president violated.</p>
      <p>What was said consistently undermined Mr. Trump’s case, but more deadly was what has never been said. In the two months since Speaker <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/nancy-pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a> announced a formal impeachment inquiry was under way and the two weeks since the Intelligence Committee’s public hearings began, no one, even in the White House, has said anything like, “He wouldn’t do that!” or “That would be so unlike him.” His best friends know he would do it and it’s exactly like him.</p>

      <p>The week’s hearings were not a seamless success for Democrats. On Tuesday they seemed to be losing the thread. But by Wednesday and Thursday it was restored.</p>

      <p>Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman was not a persuasive witness and did not move the story forward, because in spite of the obvious patriotism reflected in his record he was annoying—smug and full of himself. He appeared in full dress uniform with three rows of ribbons. When Rep. Devin Nunes called him “Mr. Vindman,” he quickly corrected him: “Ranking Member, it’s Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, please.” Oh, snap. As he described his areas of authority at the National Security Council, he seemed to glisten with self-regard. You got the impression he saw himself as fully in charge of U.S. policy toward Ukraine. Asked if it was true that government offered to make him their defense minister he said “yes” with no apparent embarrassment. I don’t know about you but I don’t like it when a foreign government gets a sense of a U.S. military officer and concludes he might fit right in. (A Ukrainian official later said the job offer was a joke.)</p>
      <p>Mr. Vindman – I’m sorry, Lt. Col. Vindman – self-valorized, as other witnesses have, and tugged in his opening statement on America’s heart strings by addressing his father, who brought his family from the Soviet Union 40 years ago: “Dad, . . . you made the right decision. . . . Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.”</p>
