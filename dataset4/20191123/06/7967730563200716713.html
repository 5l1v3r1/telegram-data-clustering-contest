      <h1>Stars take bragging rights</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:34:20+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:34</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Pierik</a></address>
      <p>It may have largely been a dismal season for the Melbourne Stars in the Women's Big Bash League but they at least have cross-town bragging rights, having enjoyed a shock seven-wicket win over the Renegades on Saturday.</p>
      <p>After player-of-the-match Anna Lanning (73 off 49 balls) had led the Renegades to 3-165 at the Eastern Oval, the bottom-placed Stars - with only the one win before this clash - secured victory with four balls remaining in Ballarat.</p>
      <p>The loss could potentially be a devastating blow to the Renegades' finals hopes, for they remain a game outside the top four, the third-placed Perth Scorchers having defeated the fourth-placed Sydney Sixers at Lilac Hill on Saturday.</p>

      <p>South African dasher Lizelle Lee (62 off 46 balls) was superb before she fell lbw attempting to reverse sweep leggie Georgia Wareham. But with the hard-hitting Erin Osborne (30 off 14 balls) handling the late pressure, the Stars finally had something to cheer about, having beaten the Scorchers earlier in the season.</p>
      <p>They needed 18 off the final two overs, victory all but confirmed when Osborne took to spinner Molly Strano, leaving only two runs needed off the final over.</p>
      <p>Skipper Elyse Villani (11 off eight) was unable to deliver the big score she craved but the Stars were not perturbed, reaching 50 off seven overs.</p>

      <p>Mignon Du Preez, on 23, survived what should have been a regulation stumping off Danni Wyatt's off-spin and went on to share in a 90-run stand with Lee. She eventually fell for 41, the damage having been done.</p>
      <p>Renegades quick Maitlan Brown had an afternoon to forget. She was unable to halt the Stars' charge in the 18th over, finishing with 0-40 off 3.2 overs.</p>

      <p>Lanning, 25, had earlier made a statement that she belongs in the WBBL with a fine knock at the top of the order. The younger sister of Australian captain Meg and a former Melbourne Star, Lanning stepped out for the first time for her new club, and only because <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53d23.html">Sophie Molineux had withdrawn on Friday </a>due to mental-health reasons.</p>
      <p>The Box Hill product quickly found her touch, crunching eight boundaries and two sixes. Elevated to the top of the order, she ensured the Renegades were given a strong platform, surging to 1-73 off 10 overs, despite losing Wyatt (nine off 10). Lanning appeared well on her way to a century before Villani completed a fine catch running back with the flight of the ball from mid off.</p>
      <p>Englishwoman Tammy Beaumont (39 off 36), with a mixture of clever strokes, was also in excellent touch although she prospered on seven when dropped by Annabel Sutherland. Skipper Jess Duffin (35 not out off 17) provided the late acceleration, thumping 16 off the final three deliveries, but it was not enough.</p>
      <p>The Renegades must regroup quickly, for they face a major challenge against the top-of-the-table Heat in Brisbane on Wednesday.</p>
