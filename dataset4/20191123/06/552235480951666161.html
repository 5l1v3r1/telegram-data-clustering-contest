      <h1>Formartine boss will call on ex-Cove stars for EK Scottish Cup clash</h1>
      <h2>Paul Lawson's side host Kilby in the third round of the Scottish Cup this afternoon</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Thomson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-thomson/</a></address>
      <p>Formartine United gaffer Paul Lawson will call on former Cove Rangers players Daniel Park and Darryn Kelly to plot EK’s Scottish Cup downfall.</p>
      <p>Park and Kelly helped sink Kilby in the SPFL play-offs last season and now ply their trade at North Lodge Park.</p>
      <p>They are set to line-up against EK on Saturday when the Lowland League side take on United in round three of the Scottish Cup.</p>
      <p>Highland League Formartine knocked out Lowland side Gala Fairydean in the last round and gaffer Lawson, the former Ross County and Celtic youth midfielder, said: “Parky and Darryn are both former Cove players, so we’ll definitely speak to them about East Kilbride to get their thoughts, as well as doing our own homework.</p>

      <p>“The teams are very evenly matched and both will feel they should be doing better in their leagues. We’ve been inconsistent but having home advantage is always a bonus.</p>
      <p>“It will still be a difficult game.”</p>

      <p>Lawson is also looking forward to catching up with an old team-mate, in Kilby defender Craig Reid.</p>
      <p>He added: “I used to play with Craig Reid when he was at Motherwell and, in our younger days, at Celtic, so it will be good to catch-up with him – but friends go out of the window for 90 minutes in these games.</p>
      <p>“This is a great opportunity for both teams to progress and potentially draw a big name.</p>

      <p>“We’ve had East Kilbrdie watched a couple of times. They’ve lost their manager since then, but with Jim being part of the old management team anyway, I’m not sure that will change things much.</p>
      <p>“It will come down to the players because they’ll see it as a good chance to get a big name out of the hat.”</p>
      <h3>United in focus</h3>
      <p>United have Paul Lawson, the former Ross County midfielder, in the hot-seat as their player manager and he is assisted by ex-Aberdeen captain Russell Anderson - also Lawson’s brother-in-law - at North Lodge Park.</p>
      <p>Similar to East Kilbride they sit mid-table in their division, occupying eighth place in the Highland League, where they have been runners-up in two of the last four seasons.</p>
      <p>They hold the record for the most goals ever scored in the Highland League, notching 137 times in 2015/16.</p>
      <p>This season, the goals haven’t been flowing as freely with the side striking 29 times in 11 games.</p>

      <p>But they do have the best defence in Highland League, conceding just seven times in their 11 outings.</p>
      <p>United are on a good run of form, having lost just once in their last seven games, winning on five occasions. At home, though, they have one win in their last four.</p>
      <p>Formartine defeated EK’s Lowland rivals Gala Fairydean Rovers in the last round of the Scottish Cup, winning a replay 2-1 at Netherdale. They saw off Turriff United 5-1 in the opening round.</p>
      <p>And striker Garry Wood may be a familiar face to many, given his spells at Ross County and Montrose.</p>
