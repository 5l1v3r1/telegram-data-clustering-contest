      <p>The Congress hit out at Devendra Fadnavis being <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/devendra-fadnavis-maharashtra-cm-again-1621847-2019-11-23">sworn-in as the Maharashtra chief minister on Saturday</a>, saying it was a "betrayal of people's mandate" and the "illegitimate" government formation will self-destruct.</p>
      <p>The month-long political impasse in Maharashtra ended dramatically on Saturday with the BJP's Fadnavis returning as the chief minister, backed by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).</p>
      <p>NCP's Ajit Pawar was sworn-in as the deputy chief minister.</p>

      <p>"This is called betrayal of people's mandate and giving contract for killing democracy," Congress's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said in a tweet.</p>

      <p>He also tagged media reports on allegations of Ajit Pawar's involvement in scams.</p>
      <p>"Lust for power washes away principles and corruption," Surjewala said on Twitter, tagging a September tweet of Fadnavis in which he had said the BJP will never ally with the NCP as it had "exposed" the latter's corruption.</p>
      <p>Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel, who was at the forefront of the Congress-NCP-Shiv Sena negotiations, said illegal and evil manoeuvres took place in the secrecy of midnight.</p>
      <p>"Such was the shame that they had to do the swearing in hiding. This illegitimate formation will self destruct," he said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>Earlier, senior Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi expressed surprise at the political developments in Maharashtra and said the Congress-NCP-Shiv Sena negotiations took too long as the window was grabbed by "fast movers".</p>
      <p>"Surreal wht I read abt #Maharashtra. Thought it was fake news. Candidly &amp;personally speaking, our tripartite negotiations shd not have gone on for more than 3 days...took too long. Window given was grabbed by fast movers. #pawarji tussi grt ho! Amazing if true, still not sure (sic)," he said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, in another tweet, Singhvi said, "My tweet at 845 am today while in a taking off flight to ahmdabad has, hopefully, been overtaken by events in view of #Sharadji's clarification. Even then I had called it surreal &amp;possibly fake news. Appears that fakeness of full #NCP joining bjp is true as per #Pawar clarfn (sic)."</p>
