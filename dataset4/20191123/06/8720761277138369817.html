      <p>Slashdot reader <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/~Rutabaga8">Rutabaga8</a> is the CEO of a web site conducting in-depth research on personal finance topics. They recently contacted Slashdot to share "some surprising results" from their analysis of a nonprofit advocacy group's <a href="https://survey.pluginamerica.org/model-s/results.php">seven years of data on Tesla batteries</a>: <i>By seven years of age, the typical car <a href="https://www.nimblefins.co.uk/study-real-life-tesla-battery-deterioration">could still deliver around 93% of the original range on a full charge</a>. That means a Tesla battery typically loses around 1 percentage point of range each year on the road.<br/><br/>Of course, cars that put more miles on the odometer are likely to get faster battery deterioration, because it√¢(TM)s the number of charges that really impact battery degradation. However, the data showed that by 150,000 miles Tesla cars still achieved more than 85% of their original range when they were charged to full capacity.</i></p>
