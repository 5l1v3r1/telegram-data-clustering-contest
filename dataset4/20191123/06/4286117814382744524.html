      <p>The NCP is likely to expel Ajit Pawar at a party meeting that is expected to take place today evening. Sources in the NCP have told India Today TV that a decision to expel Ajit Pawar may be taken today.</p>
      <p>This comes after Ajit Pawar, who was elected as NCP's MLC leader, in an unprecedented move pledged support to the BJP Saturday morning. Armed with his support, BJP's Devendra Fadnavis took oath Maharashtra's chief minister and Ajit Pawar himself took oath as the deputy chief minister.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, NCP president Sharad Pawar distanced himself from Ajit Pawar's decision. Ajit Pawar is his nephew.</p>
      <p>"Ajit Pawar's decision to support the BJP to form the Maharashtra government is his personal decision and not that of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). We place on record that we do not support or endorse this decision of his," Sharad Pawar said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>His daughter Supriya Sule, commenting on her cousin (Ajit Pawar's decision) put a WhatsApp status saying the party and the family have both been split today.</p>
      <p>Sule's another WhatsApp status read: "Who do you trust in life. Never felt so cheated in life. Defended him, loved him. Look what I get in return."</p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar shocked his party after he was sworn-in as the deputy chief minister and Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) Devendra Fadnavis as the chief minister of Maharashtra on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) won 54 seats in last month's state Assembly polls. Ajit Pawar, who represents the Baramati constituency, won the election with a record margin of 1.65 lakh votes.</p>
      <p>It is not clear yet as to how many NCP MLAs are siding with Ajit Pawar.</p>
      <p>"Pawar saheb has convened a meeting at 4.30 pm in the wake of the developments. So far, no NCP MLA is learnt to have sided with Ajit Pawar," a party leader said, requesting anonymity.</p>
      <p>Till Friday night, the NCP was busy making efforts to form a government with the Shiv Sena and the Congress in the state.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, NCP leader Nawab Malik alleged that Ajit Pawar misused the signatures of party MLAs, on the basis of which the new government was formed.</p>
      <p>He claimed that this government will not clear the floor test in the Assembly.</p>
      <p>"We want to ensure that the alliance of the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena remains," he added.</p>
