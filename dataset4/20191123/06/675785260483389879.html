      <p>'Chip-gate' is engulfingt he BBC with claiming the corporation has introduced a "six chip" rule in their canteen.</p>
      <p>Bemused workers said servers were "counting out" fries on Friday, leading to "uproar" among staff.</p>
      <p>Several shared their annoyance on social media about the move at the London HQ.</p>
      <p>Arif Ansari, head of news for BBC Asian Network, tweeted a picture showing a handful of chips next to a piece of chicken.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "New rules in the BBC canteen limit the number of chips to six! The staff seemed shocked that I didn't go with the unlimited couscous instead."</p>

      <p>Some replies said: "Would they have got away with serving just 6 chips when you were up North?"</p>
      <p>While another said: "They are quite big chips though".</p>
      <p>And one wag added: "Go find a BBC Editor....most of them have spare chips on their shoulder..."</p>
      <p>Dom Stirling, a freelance radio producer at the BBC, added: "There is currently uproar in the canteen as the '6 chip rule' is introduced... In which servers are instructed to individually count out 6 chips per person.</p>
      <p>"I wish this was a joke."</p>

      <p>The BBC denied any such rule had been introduced.</p>
      <p>The official <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> account of its press office shared a picture of a food box containing at least nine chips.</p>
      <p>It said: "There's something a little fishy about this as there is definitely no six-chip rule (see today's lunch for evidence!) - we don't want to get chippy about it but we're frying to get to the bottom of it."</p>
