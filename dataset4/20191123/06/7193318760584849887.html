      <p>Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal both played singles and doubles on Friday, but only the Spaniard was able to lead his team into the last four at the Davis Cup Finals in Madrid.</p>
      <p>Nadal guided Spain to a 2-1 comeback victory over Argentina, while Djokovic couldn't prevent Serbia from being eliminated after a 2-1 loss to Russia.</p>
      <p>Andy Murray didn't play again on Friday, but Britain made the last four by beating Germany 2-0.</p>
      <p>Spain will make its second straight semifinal appearance after Nadal and Marcel Granollers defeated Maximo Gonzalez and Leonardo Mayer 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 in the decisive doubles match in front of a lively and vocal crowd at the Caja Magica center court.</p>
      <p>Guido Pella had defeated Pablo Carreno Busta 6-7 (3), 7-6 (4), 6-1 in the first singles, but Nadal had kept Spain in contention with an easy 6-1, 6-2 win over Diego Schwartzman for his 27th straight Davis Cup singles victory.</p>
      <p>Djokovic defeated Karen Khachanov 6-3, 6-3 to even Serbia's match against Russia, then returned to the court about half an hour later to team with Viktor Troicki in the decisive doubles. They had three match points but lost to Khachanov and Andrey Rublev 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (8).</p>
      <p>The Russians converted on their first match point to put the team back in the Davis Cup semifinals for the first time since 2008.</p>
      <p>Russia will next face Canada, which eliminated Australia on Thursday</p>

        <b>Russia could be banned from Tokyo Games</b>
      </p>
      <p>The chances of the Russian flag flying at next year’s Olympics took a potentially lethal hit Friday when anti-doping regulators recommended the country be declared noncompliant for tampering with data that was supposed to help bring the entire cheating episode to a close.</p>
      <p>The World Anti-Doping Agency announced its compliance and review committee delivered the recommendation to the agency’s executive committee, which will discuss it on Dec. 9.</p>
      <p>If the executive committee agrees to declare Russia’s anti-doping agency noncompliant, it will set in motion a process that could end with Russia being booted from the Tokyo Games.</p>
      <p>This marks the latest chapter in a scandal that began before the 2014 Sochi Games, when Russian officials designed a scheme to allow their athletes to dope without getting caught by substituting urine samples taken after competition with clean ones stored from earlier.</p>

        <b>Sandusky resentenced to effectively a life term</b>
      </p>
      <p>A Pennsylvania judge dashed the hopes of former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky for a shorter prison term Friday, resentencing him to the same 30 to 60 years imposed against him in 2012 for sexually abusing children.</p>
      <p>Judge Maureen Skerda gave Sandusky what prosecutors and his own attorney described as effectively a life term during a hearing ordered this year by an appeals court.</p>
      <p>Sandusky's 2011 arrest prompted the firing of Hall of Fame head coach Joe Paterno and the university has paid more than $100 million to people who said they had been abused by Sandusky.</p>
      <p>He was convicted of 45 counts of child sexual abuse in 2012.</p>
      <p>Sandusky, 75, in a mustard yellow prison jumpsuit, again asserted his innocence Friday and choked up twice during brief remarks in open court before the sentence was handed down.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The New York Yankees plan to not pay Jacoby Ellsbury the remaining $26 million due under his contract, contending he violated the deal by getting unauthorized medical treatment.</p>
      <p>New York general manager sent a letter to Ellsbury and his agent, Scott Boras, informing them the team converted his contract to a nonguaranteed deal, a person familiar with the decision told The Associated Press on Friday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team had not made any public statements.</p>
      <p>Ellsbury has not played since 2017 and was released by the Yankees on Wednesday.</p>

        <b>Kim leads in chase for LPGA's richest prize</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sei Young Kim wasted two good birdie chances late in the second round Friday when she got a pep talk from an unlikely source.</p>
      <p>Cristie Kerr was working as a commentator for Golf Channel, and on the long walk to the 18th tee, she told Kim that a strong finish in the CME Group Tour Championship would make dinner that much better.</p>
      <p>"I just said, `Yeah, I'm going to make the birdie.' Yeah, it come true," Kim said.</p>
      <p>She fired a 6-iron to the perfect spot in the middle of the green and watched it roll toward the back pin until stopping less than 2 feet away. Kim tapped in for a birdie and a 5-under 67, keeping her lead at two shots in the chase for the richest prize in women's golf.</p>
      <p>Kim has made only one bogey over two rounds at Tiburon Golf Club in Naples, Florida, and was at 12-under 132.</p>
      <p><b>PGA:</b> Tyler Duncan has been working hard on his putting, and he was thrilled to see it pay off Friday in the RSM Classic at St. Simons Island, Georgia, with a 9-under 61, breaking by two shots his lowest score in his 67 starts on the PGA Tour. He has two-shot cushion over Sebastian Munoz, Rhein Gibson and D.J. Trahan.</p>
