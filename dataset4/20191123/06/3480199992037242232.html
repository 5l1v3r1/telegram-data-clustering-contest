      <p>The TEC Hub in the Riverside shopping centre, Shrewsbury, is holding weekly drop-in sessions for senior citizens to try out new technology for the home.</p>
      <p>Age UK Shropshire Telford &amp; Wrekin has joined forces with Shropshire Council’s Assistive Technology Team for the Tech Taster sessions on Wednesdays between 10am and 2pm.</p>
      <p>Heather Osborne, Chief Executive of Age UK Shropshire Telford &amp; Wrekin, said older people taking part could learn how to talk to Alexa, read an e-book, operate a video doorbell, control lights at home, play music and games and use health apps.</p>

      <p>"Giving the gift of consumer or assistive technology could lead to greater independence and reduce loneliness and energy costs for a loved one," she said.</p>
      <p>“Assistive technology can really help support older people, so why not give our Tech Taster sessions a try and learn something new. People are living longer with complex health conditions, and technology can help older people to stay independent, live well and safe in their own homes.”</p>
      <p>James Warman, Assistive Technology &amp; Telecare Co-ordinator Housing Services at Shropshire Council added: “At the free drop-in sessions, you’ll be able to talk to ‘Alexa’, see who’s at the front door without leaving your chair, try out motion-activated lights, get to use a smart tablet, and so much more. Staff will be on hand to give advice and support and there is no need to book, just turn up."</p>
