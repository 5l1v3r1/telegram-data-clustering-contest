      <h1>Steven Gerrard tells Rangers stars to stay off the booze for Christmas run-in as he dismisses Glen Kamara contract talks</h1>
      <h2>Gerrard has asked his players to make sacrifices in the hope it will help them achieve their long term goals.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Ralston, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gary-ralston/</a></address>
      <p>Steven Gerrard may have <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jermain-defoe">Jermain Defoe</a> – but the Rangers boss has told his players to forget all about the Ho, Ho, Ho.</p>
      <p>It’s coming up to the time for peace, love and understanding – and, more importantly for Gerrard, Premiership points on the board.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> kickstart a run of 10 games to the end of December at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hamilton-academical-fc">Hamilton</a> on Sunday, including seven in the league that could define their campaign.</p>
      <p>Gerrard is demanding his players avoid the booze these coming weeks to, well, avoid the boos.</p>
      <p>There will be no Christmas party, although the players will be given down time at their midwinter training camp in Dubai to relax and reflect.</p>
      <p>It’s all a far cry from the colourful Rangers festive parties once organised by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ally-mccoist">Ally McCoist</a> and Mark Hateley, where the fancy dress gave way to full-on revelry.</p>

      <p>Gerrard smiled at the image of that one as Superman, Spiderman and Arab sheikhs piled on a bus at Edmiston Drive, not least because he never lived a monk-like existence during all his years of success with Liverpool.</p>
      <p>He said: “Mark and Ally won’t mind me saying the game has changed – I also say that to myself, by the way. I’m not trying to paint myself as an angel!</p>
      <p>“The game has moved on and it’s now two glasses of wine, rather than the 20 we used to enjoy.</p>
      <p>“We will find the right time for the players to relax and enjoy themselves.</p>
      <p>“I’m a manager who is very fair in terms of giving them time off and family time. However, as a footballer you have to make sacrifices.</p>
      <p>“I’m certainly a person who likes to work hard and play hard. I like a glass of wine when appropriate but I’ll sacrifice it at the right time and we have a winter break coming up.</p>
      <p>“At the right time, the players will get a chance to let their hair down. The non-internationals have just had a week off, I’ll give the internationalists an extra bit of family time too. We’ve been fair across the board so the players will have to sacrifice and really be focused and professional throughout this run of fixtures. Hopefully in the long-term we will reap the rewards.</p>
      <p>“You try to create a culture from day one. You obviously have your standards in terms of the football and how you want the football to look on the pitch but off the pitch as well.</p>
      <p>“I want this to be an enjoyable place to work. People skip in, they want to work hard, they want to spend time here and they want to maximise their potential.</p>

      <p>“But outside of the work I want it to be fun, I want the banter to be flying, I want them to mix. Coffee clubs, meals, I am all for that, not a problem. But when we work we push and we push them extremely hard.”</p>
      <p>Gerrard is fortunate to have former England international Defoe at the heart of it all, a model pro who has never touched a drop of alcohol and is still claiming all the benefits of it at the age of 37.</p>
      <p>He has praised the striker for his influence on the dressing room at the Hummel Training Centre, where players such as Sheyi Ojo, Glen Kamara, Ryan Jack and Joe Aribo are revelling under his influence.</p>
      <p>Gerrard said: “They have got a great little bunch within the dressing room who are a similar age and Jermain is really the father figure to them all in there, he is really looking after them.</p>
      <p>“The team spirit in the squad seems really positive among them all at the minute. They have really helped the likes of Filip Helander to settle in quicker than normal.”</p>
      <p>Gerrard again dismissed suggestions Kamara is in line for a contract extension, less than a year after joining from Dundee, and insists he has been well enough rewarded for now.</p>

      <p>Kamara has been the snip of the year at just £50,000 and Gerrard said: “I would have paid for him myself out of my own pocket.</p>
      <p>“I watched him a lot at Dundee, we knew he was a steal.</p>
      <p>“He came away from being schooled ever so well at Arsenal, in terms of being coached technically.</p>
      <p>“He went to Dundee and really became a man on his own playing in a very competitive league,experiencing different styles.</p>
      <p>“Neil McCann got a hold of him and played an open, constructive, technical game that really suited Glen. We could actually see him playing in a similar type of game to the one we played.</p>
      <p>“But every time we saw him we thought, ‘Oh, with all due respect, he looks like a different level to everyone else around him.’</p>
      <p>“It was almost a case of trying to cherry-pick him and imagining what he would be like within what we play. It made total sense.</p>
      <p>“Glen is shy in terms of the media and around the staff but he is quite lively in the dressing room and Jermain, Connor Goldson and James Tavernier have really got him to come out of his shell.</p>
      <p>“I know he is well respected within the dressing room and he will continue to grow as a player and as a human being. He is in the best place for his development. He is lovely to watch.”</p>
