      <h3>Jen on Anna</h3>
      <p><b>What were you hoping for?</b><br/>Either a nice time or a complete disaster, so I had an anecdote.</p>
      <p><b>First impressions?</b><br/>Super pretty. She has very beautiful eyes. I’m cursed with boring eyes. I was glad that she also felt out of place in the posh restaurant.</p>
      <p><b>What did you talk about?</b><br/>Being queer and not having role models when we were teenagers, drunken antics and our love of Keira Knightley. Three hours felt like five minutes.</p>
      <p><b>Any awkward moments?</b><br/>When I showed how much of a Londoner I am and thought Bristol was in the Midlands. We were “politely asked to move to the bar” because it was an hour after we should have left the table.</p>
      <p><b>Good table manners?</b><br/>No idea what makes good or bad table manners.</p>
      <p><b>Best thing about Anna?</b><br/>We have similar outlooks. A lot of what she was saying felt super-familiar. Also, her eyes.</p>
      <p><b>Would you introduce her to your friends? </b><br/>Yep! They are already begging to meet her.</p>
      <p><b>Describe Anna in three words</b><br/>Pretty, engrossing, gay.</p>
      <p><b>What do you think she made of you?</b><br/>I find it hard to make judgments about myself because I tend to be too harsh. She seemed to like me, though.</p>
      <p><b>Did you go on somewhere?</b><br/>We stayed in another bar until last orders at just before midnight.</p>
      <p><b>And... did you kiss?</b><br/>Yesssss! Outside the station. I am so bad at kissing, though, so I hope I didn’t embarrass myself. Her glasses fogged up, which was super cute. I’d like to see her glasses fog up again.</p>
      <p><b>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? </b><br/>More time.</p>
      <p><b>Marks out of 10?</b><br/>10.</p>
      <p><b>Would you meet again?</b><br/>Yes!</p>
      <h3>Anna on Jen</h3>
      <p><b>What were you hoping for? </b><br/>Someone fun and kind, and no long silences.</p>
      <p><b>First impressions? </b><br/>She seemed nervous, but so was I. I liked her colourful hair.</p>
      <p><b>What did you talk about? </b><br/>Her sister’s upcoming wedding, shitposting, the queer community, shared houses, worst drinking stories, board games, tattoos, Pride.</p>
      <p><b>Any awkward moments? </b><br/>We asked if we could get extra wine free and they said no, but we ordered it anyway. It cost much, much more than we expected.</p>
      <p><b>Good table manners? </b><br/>She handled the bewildering array of cutlery with grace.</p>
      <p><b>Best thing about Jen? </b><br/>The way she lights up when she talks about her volunteering.</p>
      <p><b>Would you introduce her to your friends?</b><br/>She’s lovely, so they’d like her.</p>
      <p><b>Describe Jen in three words</b><br/>Sweet, open, animated.</p>
      <p><b>What do you think she made of you? </b><br/>Either she thought I was funny, or she has a great fake laugh.</p>
      <p><b>Did you go on somewhere? </b><br/>To a pub down the road.</p>
      <p><b>And… did you kiss? </b><br/>A snog outside the station.</p>
      <p><b>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? </b><br/>I’d shoot down the dessert wine idea.</p>
      <p><b>Marks out of 10?</b><br/>8.</p>
      <p><b>Would you meet again? </b><br/>We’re texting to make plans.</p>
