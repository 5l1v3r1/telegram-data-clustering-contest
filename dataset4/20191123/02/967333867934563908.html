        <b>WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - Scientists have discovered the possible cause of the Gulf War illness, which affects up to one third of veterans from the first Gulf War of 1990-91, and an effective treatment using existing anti-viral drugs, the Veterans Administration said in a press release.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"A team of scientists led by University of South Carolina’s environmental health sciences associate professor, Saurabh Chatterjee, has shown that adjusting GI tract viruses by repurposing existing FDA [Food and Drug Administration]-approved antiviral drugs offers a route for effective treatment for Gulf War Illness and its myriad of symptoms," the release said.</p>
      <p>Chatterjee’s team had previously demonstrated that chemical exposure from the Gulf War <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201910261077153200-us-military-develops-algorithm-to-predict-illness-48-hours-before-symptoms--report/">alters the balance between the viruses and bacteria</a> that naturally occur in the human GI tract, causing Gulf War Illness, the release said.</p>
      <blockquote>Symptoms that include gastrointestinal disturbances, chronic fatigue, widespread pain, chronic headaches, respiratory and sleep problems as well as neurological problems in memory and learning, had baffled scientists for decades.</blockquote>
      <p>The scientists then developed an effective treatment by using existing antiviral drugs to adjust the balance of gut microbes, a discovery that will lead clinicians to test the treatment at an accelerated pace without the need for the lengthy time needed to develop new drugs, the release said.</p>
      <p>Nearly 30 years after the conflict, the<a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201707111055421651-us-medical-training-gulf-war/"> Gulf War illness continues to affect</a> 25-33 percent of the 700,000 US veterans who served, according to the release. In addition, soldiers deployed in subsequent wars have also reported similar immune system or neurological disorders.</p>
