      <p>Syd Mead, the artistic director behind popular sci-fi movie <i>Blade Runner</i>, said in an emailed statement to Business Insider that Tesla’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-truck-pictures-info-details-price-2019-11">new Cybertruck</a> “has completely changed the vocabulary of the personal truck market design.”</p>
      <p>Mead called the futuristic-looking design “stylistically breathtaking” and said it went beyond his expectations.</p>
      <p>When Elon Musk first announced the truck last November, he told <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/2/18053424/elon-musk-tesla-spacex-boring-company-self-driving-cars-saudi-twitter-kara-swisher-decode-podcast">Recode’s Kara Swisher</a> that the truck would “look like something out of ‘Blade Runner.'” Mead said in his statement that, “as a long time admirer of Elon Musk, [he] was truly flattered” to hear that the Cybertruck would take a cue from the movie.</p>
