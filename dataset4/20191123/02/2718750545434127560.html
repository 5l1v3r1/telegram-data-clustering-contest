      <h1>Louie Anderson Is a Talking Cat</h1>

      <p>Upon learning that Emmy-winning <i>Baskets </i>star <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/louie-anderson/">Louie Anderson</a> will be <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/louie-anderson-talking-cat-fox-comedy-1203413738/">portraying a talking cat</a> in Fox’s upcoming comedy <i>Tigsley</i>, which just received a script commitment from the network with a penalty attached, you might reasonably assume the comedian will be voicing an animated kitty. After all, he created and starred in the 1994 Fox series, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/life-with-louie/"><i>Life With Louie</i></a>, which ran for three seasons and featured Anderson voicing a fictionalized cartoon version of himself as a child, as well as his own boisterous father. However, you would be dead wrong. Luckily, you have eight more lives to work with, so you’re good.</p>
      <p><a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/louie-anderson-talking-cat-fox-comedy-1203413738/">According to <i>Variety</i></a>, Anderson’s feline character “will appear onscreen in a cat costume rather than lending his voice to a CGI or puppet character.” The comedian developed the multicamera series with <i>The Goldbergs </i>executive producer Mike Sikowitz “as an adult comedy about a family dealing with life, love, the pursuit of happiness, and their obnoxious insult-hurling talking cat.” What’s that frantic clawing sound? Why, it’s the Emmy voters, and they’re going to absolutely wreck your door if you don’t let them in here immediately.</p>
