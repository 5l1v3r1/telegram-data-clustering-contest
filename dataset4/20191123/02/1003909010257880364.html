      <h1>Winnipeg Blue Bombers superfans hoping to end 30-year dry spell</h1>

      <p>While most years Blue Bombers superfans Jay Diamond and Martin Shaff might stand out, this year the pair blend in as Winnipeg supporters pack Grey Cup celebrations in Calgary.</p>
      <p>Dressed from head to toe in blue and gold, including argyle and paisley Bombers-coloured pants, the longtime friends and Grey Cup veterans are hoping Sunday’s championship against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats breaks an almost 30-year dry spell for their team.</p>
      <p>If it does, two Grey Cup rookies from California who are joining the pair might be the good luck charm they’ve needed all along.</p>
      <p>Diamond and Shaff were born and raised in Manitoba and have been friends for over 40 years. Despite Diamond moving around the world and eventually calling California home, the friends have stayed in touch, connected by their Bombers bond.</p>
      <p>Their loyalty to the Bombers is unwavering and is one of a handful of reasons Americans Daisy MacCallum and Steve Bollinger decided to attend the Grey Cup after hearing Diamond talk about the festival and his team after a curling match in California.</p>
      <p>“Within 15 minutes, they were locked and loaded and within a week they had bought tickets, airfare and (booked) a hotel,” said Diamond. Now, he’s hoping both MacCallum and Bollinger end the weekend backing True Blue.</p>
      <p>Celebrating their team’s West Division win at the Touchdown Manitoba team party at the BMO Centre on Friday, the superfans introduced the American duo to the world of Canadian football and the heart of the Bombers fan club.</p>

      <p>Rookie CFL fan and California sports medicine doctor MacCallum has been quick to jump on the Bombers bandwagon, sporting a gold Bombers jersey and teasing their buddy Bollinger for being a Saskatchewan Roughriders supporter.</p>
      <p>She said her profession has made her a “fan of the fans,” with no allegiance to one team in particular and said the Grey Cup is uniquely Canadian in that it offers a space for fans of every team to come together and celebrate the national league regardless of who’s vying for the Cup.</p>
      <p>MacCallum said she could only describe the experience as pure happiness.</p>
      <p>“I have a smile on my face the whole entire time and I think that’s the best way to describe it, just with the emotion that you’re feeling as you walk through the doors. You just feel it from everybody that’s here,” she said.</p>
      <p>“In a world where you hear stories about fans being pretty brutal to other opposing fans, it’s just so refreshing and it makes you feel warm inside to be in a venue where there aren’t just two teams being represented but all the teams.”</p>
      <p>Despite spending just hours at the Grey Cup festival so far, she’s hoping to make it a tradition — in her newly adopted royal blue and gold, of course.</p>

      <p>Bombers fans are thirsty for a Grey Cup win this weekend after an almost 30-year drought. In 2011, despite a hopeful advance into the 99th Grey Cup Championship, the Bombers extended its dry spell after losing to the B.C. Lions 34-23.</p>
      <p>Diamond said the loss came as no surprise considering they “squeaked” into the championship game, but this year he said the Blue and Gold have earned their way into the biggest football match of the year.</p>
      <p>When asked if he would ever throw his support behind another team, he said that’s “crazy talk.”</p>
      <p>“Winnipegers are a hearty bunch. It’s really, really cold there and we’ve been to a lot of games where it’s -40C and the windchill takes it down another 40C and we stick it out,” he said, joking. “We know how to be resilient.”</p>
      <p>Shaff and Diamond attended their first Grey Cup Championship in 2006 and have made it somewhat of a tradition since then, with this year’s championship marking their eighth Grey Cup together.</p>
      <p>The pair refuse to jinx their hometown heroes and are tight-lipped to say who they think will win, but it’s fair to say a True Blue victory against the Ticats on Sunday would go down in history for the superfans and their rookie counterparts.</p>
      <p>“It’s going to be a fantastic game,” said Diamond. “These are really the two best teams playing right now and the Bombers have earned their way in.”</p>
