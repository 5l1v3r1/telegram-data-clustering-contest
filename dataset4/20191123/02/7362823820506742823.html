      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california">California</a> Department of Forestry and Fire Protection filed a lawsuit against the popular burger chain <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/fast-food">In-N-Out</a> on Friday, alleging it was responsible for a 2017 grass <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/fires">fire</a>.</p>
      <p>The state is seeking $1.2 million for the Sept. 20, 2017 blaze it says was sparked on property owned by the chain in Arroyo Grande, 175 miles north of Los Angeles, The <a href="https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/article237634039.html">San Luis Obispo Tribune</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The blaze was caused by a tractor mowing grass on the property, which was covered in "dry annual grasses and scattered brush" that "created a receptive bed of flammable vegetation,” Cal Fire said. The suit said the chaff built up in the mower deck was ignited by a hot clutch, blown off and deposited on dry grass.</p>

      <p>The fire quickly spread to surrounding vegetation and was aided by winds, according to the suit.</p>
      <p>“Wildland fires such as the Huasna Fire ordinarily do not happen unless someone was negligent,” the lawsuit reads.</p>
