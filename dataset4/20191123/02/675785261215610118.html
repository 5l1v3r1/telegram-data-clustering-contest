      <p>Shot-lovers can now get their hands full with a 'yard of Jäger' - for under a tenner.</p>
      <p>Bargain shop <a href="https://www.bmstores.co.uk/products/jagermeister-yard-of-jager-10-x-2cl-339710">B&amp;M</a> is selling a pack of 10 miniature Jägermeister with each bottle containing 20ml of the digestif.</p>
      <p>The famous German liqueur was spotted by a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> page 'Money Saver Online' on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The post has soon attracted over 17,000 comments as web users claimed their 'Christmas presents sorted'.</p>
      <p>One said: "I am going there on Friday/ Saturday if anyone wants any."</p>

      <p>Another one wrote: "Bargain...stock up on these miniatures for wedding favours eh."</p>
      <p>A third said: "That's your Christmas pressies sorted."</p>
      <p>But some frugal web users did the calculations and said it's a money trap.</p>
      <p>"Don't get mugged off! Clearly says 10 x 2cl minis. That's 200ml for a tenner when a 700ml bottle's less than £20!" one commented.</p>
      <p>One said: "Got this last year they r only small bottles got four drunks out of it. I rather buy a big bottle lasts longer."</p>
      <p>Waitrose is selling a 50cl (500ml) Jägermeister for £13 and Sainsbury's is selling a 70cl (700ml) one for £16.</p>
      <p>The same product is also available at Jagershop and Bargain Booze for the same price.</p>
      <p>Apparently, this is not the first time the spirit company launched the product during festive seasons.</p>
      <p>Jägermeister first posted the 'yard of Jägermeister' in December 2017 and it was priced under £10.</p>
      <p>The herbal liqueur is made from 56 herbs and spices at a strength of 35 per cent alcohol by volume.</p>
