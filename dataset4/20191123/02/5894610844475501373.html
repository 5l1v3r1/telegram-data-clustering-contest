      <p>A group representing asylum seekers in Ireland is hitting out at plans by the Government to expand the direct provision programme.</p>
      <p>It emerged yesterday the Department of Justice was seeking providers to operate centres in eight regions covering the 26 counties to house 5,500 asylum seekers.</p>
      <p>It is likely the cost of the new centres will be €320m over the coming years.</p>
      <p>But the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland (Masi) said it was shocked to learn of the plan.</p>

      <p>"The Government has two groups currently reviewing the provision of material supports to asylum seekers.</p>
      <p>"Such an announcement makes a mockery of the advisory group that was set up by the Government recently to review the system," a statement from the group said. Masi compared direct provision to apartheid segregation.</p>
      <p>"Asylum seekers do not need more direct provision centres. We need the Irish Government to stop treating us differently," it said.</p>
      <p>A statement from the Department of Justice said that last December it commenced a regional procurement process to identify an additional supply of premises to meet the department's increased demand for accommodation.</p>
      <p>Another reason was to implement a common higher standard across all new and existing accommodation centres, including the provision of independent living allowing residents to cook for themselves and providing designated living space for families.</p>
      <p>The current tendering process forms part of the department's concerted effort "to improve conditions" in centres.</p>
