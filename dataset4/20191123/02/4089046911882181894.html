      <p>On Thursday evening, Victor Delarosa was cleaning out a work van when he noticed a woman walking on Sixth Avenue. Delarosa said she appeared to be in pain so he called out to her.</p>
      <p>"She's in pain, and I'm like 'are you okay'? And she don't answer."</p>
      <p>Delarosa said the woman was in pain but managed to yell, "I'm in labor."</p>
      <p>When she said that, Delarosa said he immediately called 911. "I started freaking out a little bit because I'm like what do I do?" Delarosa said.</p>
      <p>During the chaos, Delarosa said he was only able to catch the woman's first name, Amanda, but wants to connect with her and know how things turned out.</p>
      <p>"I really would like to know what happened because like I said, it was really concerning to me at the time," he said.</p>
      <p>And in good fun he joked, "If she had a boy, she could name him after me."</p>
      <p>If you know a woman named Amanda who had a baby on November 21 and got helped by a moving man with College Hunks moving service, reach out to WVLT News at 865-766-8154 or email us at wvlt.news@wvlt-tv.com.</p>
