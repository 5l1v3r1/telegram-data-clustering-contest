      <h1>Woman behind ‘El Bloombito’ Twitter account has no idea why it was briefly suspended</h1>

      <p>The Staten Island woman who tweets from the parody account <a href="https://twitter.com/elbloombito?lang=en">“El Bloombito”</a> said she has no idea why her account was briefly suspended on Friday evening — a move that had prompted outrage by the account’s fans.</p>
      <p>Rachel Figueroa, the 33-year-old behind the account, said she filled out an appeal to Twitter, which then reinstated her account — but offered her no explanation of why it went down.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know why it was suspended. And I didn’t know it was brought back online until it was,” she said Friday night.</p>
      <p>“I never got an official response from Twitter. The account just came back up,” she added.</p>
      <p>The account, which playfully pokes fun at former Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s tortured use of the Spanish language, was suspended before 6 p.m. Friday evening, and fans were besides themselves.</p>
      <p>“This ain’t right! This was of the funniest NYC accounts to exist, right up there w/ that time the Bronx Zoo Cobra started tweeting from Ray’s Pizza,” <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1198017776360796160">Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted</a> after the suspension.</p>
      <p>A Twitter spokesperson said the account was suspended by mistake.</p>
