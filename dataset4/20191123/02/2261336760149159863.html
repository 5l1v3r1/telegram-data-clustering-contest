      <h1>After unbeaten 2019, Glover Teixeira wants Jan Blachowicz or Corey Anderson rematch next</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T02:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 02:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lucas Rezende</a></address>
      <p>2019 proved to be a fruitful one for UFC light heavyweight veteran Glover Teixeira.</p>
      <p>With two submissions and a split decision win under his belt, the 40-year-old is enjoying his first winning streak since his three-fight run from 2015-16.</p>
      <p>Now, as the year comes to an end, Teixeira is looking towards his first bout for 2020, and he already has some names in mind. In an interview with <a href="https://globoesporte.globo.com/combate/noticia/glover-teixeira-comemora-boa-temporada-e-mira-desafios-para-voltar-ao-caminho-do-cinturao.ghtml">Combate</a>, Glover revealed two names at the top of his list, including the last man to defeat him.</p>
      <p>“Some new blood is getting into the title mix, but I’m super motivated,” Teixeira said. “I would like to take on the top guys now. I would like a rematch with Corey Anderson or a fight with Jan Blachowicz, I think both would be a good fight for me. I would like to fight them, who knows, I might fight them in the beginning of next year, we’ll see.”</p>
      <p>“I want to fight guys who are in the title mix,” Teixeira said. “I have always fought top guys. The guys I lost to always challenged the title, because they were, like, title eliminators. I lost to Alexander Gustafsson and Anthony Johnson and they fought for the belt. Then I won fights against really tough guys. Now I need to take on a big name like Corey or Blachowicz, in order to get into the mix again.”</p>
      <p>In his last fight, Glover Teixeira edged out Nikita Krylov via split decision, in September. Before that, the Brazilian picked up submission wins over the likes of Ion Cutelaba and Karl Roberson. His last loss dates back to July 2018, when Glover dropped a unanimous decision to Anderson.</p>
