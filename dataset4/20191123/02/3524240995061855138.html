      </p>
      <p>Warring parties in the lingering crisis rocking the ruling All Progressives Congress in Edo State on Friday differed on the Governor Abdullahi Ganduje committee set up by the National Working Committee of the party in Abuja.</p>
      <p>The committee was set up even as a Benin High Court granted an ex parte order restraining Col. David Imuse from parading himself as the chairman of the Edo APC.</p>
      <p>Imuse belongs to the APC faction in the state loyal to the party national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole.</p>
      <p>The Special Adviser to Governor Godwin Obaseki on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr Crusoe Osagie, described the Ganduje committee as putting the cart before the horse.</p>
      <p>He said the NWC had no <i>locus standi</i> to set up the committee, adding that it was only the National Executive Council, currently holding its meeting in Abuja that had the authority to do so.</p>
      <p>“We believe the committee is like putting the cart before the horse. A NEC meeting is holding right now as we speak, so what is the purpose of setting up a committee on it. We believe that all the issues concerning Edo will be trashed at that meeting; so what the NWC has done is null and void. The outcome of the NEC meeting is what is going to determine what we are going to do. In any case, the NWC is not constitutionally empowered to do such a thing; it is only the NEC that has the power to do so,” he said.</p>
      <p>But Mr Samson Osagie, the co-convener of Edo Peoples Movement, which has collapsed into the “Authentic APC”, said the committee would be welcomed to the state and would be given all the support needed to investigate the crisis.</p>
      <p>“For us, we are ready to assist them to get to the root cause of the problem. We will welcome them and give them all our support,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Justice V.O.A. Oviawe on Friday granted an ex-parte order sought by the APC Chairman, Mr Anselm Ojezua. The order of interim injunction directed that the status quo as of November 10, 2019 with regard to the chairmanship of the APC, Edo State chapter be maintained by the parties pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice praying for interlocutory injunction.</p>
      <p>Justice Oviawe, sitting in High Court No 10, in the absence of the parties said the court having heard Ken Mozia, SAN, counsel for the claimant/applicant, “have carefully considered this application, the affidavit, evidence before the court and the legal submissions of counsel for the applicants together with the authorities cited and I have come to a determination that this application for an order of interim injunction finds merit.</p>
      <p>“I am satisfied that there is a substantial issue to be tried at the hearing. An order of interim injunction which is granted upon an ex-parte is always granted for a short and limited period depending on the gravity and urgency of the situation in order to essentially preserve the res or status quo pending the hearing of an interlocutory application on the same matter.</p>
      <p>“Accordingly, an order of interim injunction is hereby granted directing that the status quo as of 10/11/19 with regard to the chairmanship of the All Progressives Congress, Edo State chapter be maintained pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice praying for an order of interlocutory injunction.”</p>
