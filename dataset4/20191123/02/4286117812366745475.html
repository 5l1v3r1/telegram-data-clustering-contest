      <p>Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in on Saturday morning as the chief minister of Maharashtra: a stunning development that came as the nation expected an alliance excluding the BJP to claim the right to form a government.</p>
      <p>What's more, <b>the man taking oath as deputy chief minister was <i>Ajit Pawar</i></b>, a member of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), one of the three parties working to create the alternative alliance.</p>
      <p>Minutes after Fadnavis and Pawar were sworn in, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated them and said he was "confident they will work diligently for the bright future of Maharashtra".</p>
      <p>President's Rule, which was imposed in Maharashtra on November 12, has been revoked.</p>

        <b>A BOLT FROM THE BLUE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar is the nephew of NCP president Sharad Pawar, who only yesterday said all three members of a new prospective governing alliance -- between the NCP, the Shiv Sena and the Congress -- wanted Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray in the chief minister's job.</p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar said he reached his decision to join hands with the BJP on his own.</p>
      <p>Sharad Pawar soon <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/sharad-pawar-ajit-pawar-maharashtra-bjp-government-1621861-2019-11-23">said his nephew's decision didn't have the NCP's blessing</a>. Other NCP leaders, too, expressed complete surprise.</p>
      <p>Earlier, sources quoted by ANI had said Sharad Pawar <i>was</i> a part of discussions for a Fadnavis-led government, and that he gave his assent to Ajit. The sources said no decision is taken by the NCP without Sharad Pawar's assent.</p>

      <p>But Sharad Pawar, in fact, is said to have called up Uddhav Thackeray, the Shiv Sena chief, to assure him the NCP had nothing to do with this morning's stunning twist. The Sena, on the other hand, <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/sharad-pawar-1621870-2019-11-23">expressed support for Pawar senior</a> and tore into his nephew.</p>
      <p>Later, both <b>Pawar and Thackeray put up a united front at a press meet</b>, where the Sena supremo<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/uddhav-thackeray-maharashtra-shiv-sena-bjp-ncp-1621931-2019-11-23"> decried a "surgical strike" on Maharashtra</a>.</p>
      <p>Sources say the NCP may decide to expel Ajit Pawar. Pawar senior says a decision on replacing him as legislature party leader will be taken at a later meeting.</p>
      <blockquote>"Ajit Pawar's decision to support the BJP to form the Maharashtra government is his personal decision and not that of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). We place on record that we do not support or endorse this decision of his."<cite>- Sharad Pawar on Twitter, November 23</cite></blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>PAWAR VS PAWAR</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sources said a letter of support signed by NCP MLAs, which didn't mention whom to support, were with Ajit Pawar -- and that he used these letters to offer support to Devendra Fadnavis. Opposition leaders, too, have accused him of misusing the letters.</p>
      <p>NCP MLAs who were present at the joint press meet addressed by Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/sharad-pawar-maharashtra-shiv-sena-ncp-1621928-2019-11-23">said they didn't know</a> they were being taken to Raj Bhavan for a swearing-in ceremony.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut claimed most MLAs who went with Ajit Pawar had returned, and that Ajit himself <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/sanjay-raut-says-ajit-pawar-blackmailed-saamana-1621950-2019-11-23">had been blackmailed</a>.</p>
      <p>Devendra Fadnavis, on his part, said Maharashtra needed a stable government, and not a "khichdi" administration.</p>
      <p>To get an idea of just how unexpected all of this was, take a look at what senior Congressman Abhishek Manu Singhvi tweeted this morning. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/surreal-what-i-read-about-maharashtra-congress-leader-abhishek-manu-singhvi-sharad-pawar-bjp-maharashtra-twist-1621858-2019-11-23">He thought the news was fake</a>.</p>

      <p>In the October state election, the BJP was the single largest party, with 105 seats. Its former ally Shiv Sena won 56. The NCP was third with 54, and the Congress fourth with 44.</p>
      <p>The BJP and NCP's combined tally takes them well past halfway mark in the 289-member assembly, which has one nominated MLA -- <b>but it remains to be seen how many of the NCP MLAs support Ajit Pawar</b>.</p>

      <p>Maharashtra was placed under President's Rule on November 12, after a falling out between the BJP and the Shiv Sena caused a long delay in government formation.</p>
      <p>Now, at last, the delay is over -- although it's safe to say no one expected it to end <i>this</i> way.</p>
