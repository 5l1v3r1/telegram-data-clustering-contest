      <p>On Friday, Khesari Lal Yadav exited <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/salman-khan/">Salman Khan</a>-hosted reality show Bigg Boss 13. In a new twist, Bigg Boss asked contestants to name one nominated housemate who doesn’t deserve to be in the show. Khesari received the maximum votes, leading to his ousting. Apart from the actor, Arti Singh, Sidharth Shukla, Rashami Desai and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/devoleena-bhattacharjee">Devoleena Bhattacharjee</a> were nominated this week. Khesari had entered the show as a wild card post the mid-season finale.</p>
      <p>This week the nomination came with an interesting twist. Each housemate had to name two contestants who they wanted to save from elimination. While Sidharth was nominated by Bigg Boss as a punishment for his aggression, Arti, Khesari, Devoleena and Rashami received only one vote each. While Khesari and Arti seemed to accept their fate, Devoleena and Rashami fought with their friends for not voting for them. Paras Chhabra was the only one who voted for Khesari.</p>
      <p>The Bhojpuri superstar entered the show with a lot of confidence. But his simple personality and unfamiliarity with ways of Bigg Boss became the biggest barrier for him. Khesari himself accepted that he was a misfit on the show. While it was hard to catch a glimpse of the actor in the first two weeks, earlier this week, when Paras gave him a new look, he grabbed some spotlight.</p>
      <p>Before entering the show, Khesari Lal Yadav had told <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a> that the controversial reality show was a boost for his career. “Bigg Boss is such a popular show that it will help me increase my national and international reach. I am here to stay and so want to broaden my horizons. Bhojpuri industry is my motherland, and I would keep doing more regional films. But I also want to reach out to a bigger audience,” he shared.</p>
      <p>The actor also added that he will never play a dirty game to win the show. He said, “I will decide once I enter the show. But all I can say is that I will never change my ideologies for anyone. I will go with dignity and come back with dignity. I will never hurt anyone to win the show. I don’t want to come across in the wrong light that after the show, I don’t even get work offers. But to tell you honestly, it doesn’t really matter as I am going to Bigg Boss to win my audience’s heart and not the housemates.”</p>
      <p>Post Khesari Lal Yadav’s exit, the competition is now between Sidharth Shukla, Arti Singh, Shehnaaz Gill, Shefali Jariwala, Asim Riaz, Himanshi Khurana, Paras Chhabra, Mahira Sharma, Devoleena Bhattacharjee, Rashami Desai, Hindustani Bhau and Vishal Aditya Singh.</p>
