        <b>While talking up his team-mates, Lionel Messi labelled the Ballon d’Or a “beautiful recognition”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Barcelona star Lionel Messi talked up the significance of the Ballon d’Or, but said even the individual award came down to team success.</p>
      <p>Messi, 32, is a five-time winner of the prize, claiming it in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2015.</p>
      <p>Only Cristiano Ronaldo has won the award as many times and Messi said it was a huge honour, although he acknowledged his team-mates were key to his success.</p>
      <p>“It is a beautiful recognition and perhaps the most special was the first,” he told Otro.</p>
      <p>“It is something that comes from the collective. Without having achieved all the collective successes that we had to achieve, I wouldn’t have been able to get these individual awards.”</p>
      <p>Messi will again be among the favourites to win the Ballon d’Or this year, having enjoyed a fine 2019 for Barcelona.</p>

      <p>The 2010 Ballon d’Or is among Messi’s favourites after he claimed the honour ahead of team-mates Andres Iniesta and Xavi in a Barcelona clean sweep.</p>
      <p>“The image of the three nominees for the Ballon d’Or, it was special for us because of the friendship we have,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Being so long in the same club, all three living practically the same during our whole careers and special for the club.</p>
      <p>“For what it means, the truth, it was impressive.”</p>
      <p>Barcelona, who are top of LaLiga, return to action with a trip to Leganes on Saturday.</p>
