      <p>Game Freak director and Pokémon series producer Junichi Masuda is best known for his music contributions to the series. Since <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon Red and Blue</a></b> first debuted on the Game Boy, Masuda's compositions have given atmosphere to every mainline game he's been involved with.</p>
      <p>Last year, Masuda said, "...it’s important to have the younger generation at Game Freak take over the development of Pokémon as a series. I do believe this will probably be, in terms of the main Pokémon RPGs, the last time that I work as the director." It appears now he may have also stepped aside as the chief composer of the series.</p>
      <p>In the <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></b> credits, you can see Junichi Masuda's name is distinctly missing from the music and sound sections, although he is featured in the producer role. He also did not appear as the director of Sword and Shield but is still the managing director of Game Freak as a whole.</p>
