      <p>Yesterday, Alphabet's Loon <a href="https://medium.com/loon-for-all/loon-signs-deal-to-bring-balloon-powered-internet-to-amazon-rainforest-region-in-peru-34696714976c">announced</a> that it has signed a new commercial agreement with Internet Para Todos Peru <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20976065/alphabet-loon-internet-balloon-remote-parts-amazon-2020-telefonica">to provide mobile internet connectivity to parts of the Amazon rainforest in Peru starting in 2020</a>. The Verge reports: <i>Loon will use its high-altitude internet balloons to provide mobile internet from Telefonica to the selected areas. Telefonica is a part owner of Internet Para Todos Peru, a mobile infrastructure operator that is working to bring internet connectivity to remote populations in Latin America. Alphabet's blog says that the deployment will initially provide service to an area where nearly 200,000 people live, and that the deployment will make Peru the first country in Latin America to use high-altitude balloons to provide internet connectivity "on a sustained, non-emergency basis."</i></p>
