      <p>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — About 15 minutes after the end of an NBA game Friday night, the Utah Jazz’s home arena was evacuated because of a suspicious package.</p>
      <p>Salt Lake City police say the package turned out to be a toolbox, and the Jazz say employees were cleared by authorities to re-enter the building a couple of hours after the evacuation.</p>
      <p>Most fans had already exited Vivint Smart Home Arena following Utah’s 113-109 victory over the Golden State Warriors when players, coaches and reporters were instructed to leave immediately.</p>
      <p>Not long after both coaches finished answering postgame questions from the media, a spokesman for the Jazz told reporters to exit the building due to the suspicious package. Outside, they were instructed by security to leave the premises.</p>
      <p>Utah players quickly headed for their cars in the parking lot — center Rudy Gobert was still in uniform as he left. Warriors players boarded their team bus.</p>
      <p>Salt Lake City police Lt. Carlos Valencia said the suspicious package looked like a shoebox and was discovered under a table at a restaurant in the northeast corner of the arena. He said the call came in from a uniformed officer working part-time at the game around 9:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>Arena bomb dogs went near the package and “got a hit on it,” Valencia said.</p>
