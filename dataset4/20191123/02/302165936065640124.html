      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 23 — Holy priceless collection! Batman and Robin’s costumes from the iconic 1960s television series starring Adam West are set to go on sale in Los Angeles for an estimated US$150,000 (RM625,815) to US$200,000.</p>
      <p>Burt Ward played Robin alongside West’s caped crusader in 120 episodes of the camp cult hit <i>Batman</i> from 1966-68, battling flamboyant villains from The Joker to Catwoman.</p>
      <p>According to Hollywood memorabilia auction house Profiles in History, the sale will be the only known pair of complete costumes from the superhero duo.</p>
      <p>Other items from the show going under the hammer on December 17 include the bust of Shakespeare containing a secret switch to open the Batcave, and the Batmobile’s famous phone.</p>
      <p>The pieces belong to the collection of John Azarian, described by the auction house as the “most important collection of classic TV and superhero artifacts in existence.”</p>
      <p>The sale also includes tunics worn by William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy as Captain Kirk and Spock on the original Star Trek, estimated at US$40,000 to 60,000 each.</p>
      <p>The Fonz’s signature leather jacket from <i>Happy Days</i> is predicted to yield at least US$25,000.</p>
      <p>In September, the same auctioneer sold Darth Vader’s helmet from <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> for US$1,125,000. — AFP</p>
