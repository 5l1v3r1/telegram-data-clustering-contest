      <h3>Crisis mode: Layoffs loom as Delaney pay-off to be revealed</h3>
      <p>John Delaney's pay-off from the FAI will be revealed over the next week when the cash-strapped association eventually publishes its accounts.</p>
      <p>A reconvened AGM to discuss the financial statements is likely to be held on Saturday, December 21, after the accounts weren't signed off at a meeting of the eight-person board last night.</p>

      <p>The FAI's new vice-president Paul Cooke warned that the figures would cause "shock" in football circles.</p>
      <p>Debts could soar above €50m when the emergency overdraft facility provided by Uefa over the summer is added to the legacy mortgage on Lansdowne Road.</p>
      <p>Sports Minister Shane Ross and his fellow deputies on the Oireachtas committee have been seeking details of Mr Delaney's severance package - understood to be around €300,000.</p>
      <p>Mr Delaney's formal exit was confirmed on September 29 following late-night negotiations.</p>
      <p>He was on gardening leave in April on his full €360,000 salary as an unprecedented crisis at the FAI deepened.</p>
      <p>The Waterford man was less than a month in a role of executive vice-president after being reassigned from the CEO post he held for almost 15 years.</p>
      <p>Noel Mooney, who replaced Mr Delaney in a caretaker capacity, is set to be succeeded by John Foley when he returns to his employment with Uefa next week.</p>
      <p>Mr Foley has held similar positions at Athletics and Cycling Ireland.</p>
      <p>He's also been on the League of Ireland board for the past 12 years as an independent director.</p>
      <p>Amid the financial maelstrom, Mr Foley will be tasked with pruning the company's cost base.</p>
      <p>The wage bill at the organisation, which employs 200 workers, is around €11m, heightening the possibility of pay cuts or layoffs.</p>
      <p>Some key personnel have already quit the FAI since the crisis erupted.</p>
      <p>It's also believed the disposal of some property interests is under review to generate much-needed cash.</p>
      <p>The FAI's portfolio includes stakes in the grounds of League of Ireland clubs Drogheda United, Cobh Ramblers and Wexford. It also splits ownership of the Clonshaugh football complex in Dublin with the AUL.</p>
      <p>A pack due to delegates over the next week will also include an amended version of the 2017 accounts arising from issues flagged by auditors in April of this year.</p>
      <p>Deloitte lodged an H4 notice with the Companies Office concerning a failure to keep proper records.</p>
      <p>The Revenue Commissioners have also reassessed four years of returns made by the FAI.</p>
      <p>Those extra liabilities included in the latest accounts compound their financial woes.</p>
      <p>Multimillions have already been forked out this year on legal and financial costs related to various ongoing audits and reports.</p>
